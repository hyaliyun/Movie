The species name is in reference to its unusual lamina. Description Under the tubes, directly in contact with the substrate, there is a continuous membrane, a basal lamina, and above it the anastomosed tubes characteristic of Clathrina. It is possible that this basal lamina is only an artefact created by the dried state of the specimen as Dendy (1891) supposed, but the skeleton in this region of the sponge is different from the skeleton in the tubes. The skeleton is formed by triactines only, as stated by Carter (1886) in the original description, although there are in fact three different categories of triactines, based on size. All have conical actines and sharp tips. The largest are generally found on the external tubes of the sponge, i.e. on the surface of the cormus. They can also be found in the basal lamina, although this is rare. The other two sizes of triactines are more abundant in the basal lamina, and can also be seen on the surface of the tubes, but are less abundant.

It is attached to the substrate by a few tubes, which are not true stalks. There are no water-collecting tubes, but vents on the surface. Cells with granules could not be found because of the state of preservation of the type specimen. The skeleton comprises equiangular and equiradiate triactines and tetractines on the tubes‚Äô interior, and tripods and tetrapods on the exterior delimiting the cormus. The actines of the triactines and tetractines are conical, with sharp tips. The apical actine of the tetractines is shorter than the facial ones, conical, sharp and straight. The spines are located at the tip. Tripods and tetrapods are very abundant. The tripods are true tripods. Tetrapods are similar to tripods in that they also possess stout actines and a raised centre. However, they have developed a fourth, apical, actine, which is shorter than the facial ones; it is conical and differs from the apical actine of the tetractines in that it is smooth.

Founded in 1966 in the Swiss city of Solothurn, the annual festival presents a representative selection of Swiss feature, documentary, and short film productions. In a series of public talks and panel discussions, the audience meets with members of the film industry to discuss the screened films and the culture of film in Switzerland. With over 60,000 visitors every year, the Solothurn Film Festival ranks among the most renowned cultural events in the country. Solothurner Filmtage 2011 Party at Solheure Festival Club  History  Typical lighting of Landhaus and Uferbau during the festival The Solothurn Film Festival ranks among the oldest film festivals in Switzerland and is the most important festival for Swiss film productions. In 1966 the Solothurn Film Guild organized a conference called ‚ÄúSwiss film today.‚Äù The aim was to generate new ideas and inspiration for young, independent Swiss filmmakers. From this evolved the association called ‚ÄúSchweizerische Gesellschaft Solothurner Filmtage‚Äù (SGSF), which is responsible for organizing the festival. First Festival's poster Although the Solothurn Film Festival has already existed for nearly half a century, there have only been three directors throughout its history: Stephan Portmann was the festival's first director in 1967; in 1987 he was replaced by Ivo Kummer. When Ivo Kummer accepted the position as head of the Film Department for the Swiss Federal Office of Culture (SFOC) as of August 1, 2011, Seraina Rohrer was appointed as his successor. Between 1998 and 2008, Solothurn hosted the award ceremony of the Swiss Film Prize during the festival. In 2009 the award ceremony was relocated to the KKL Luzern (Culture and Convention Centre Lucerne). The nominees for the Swiss Film Prize are selected and announced in Solothurn during the festival.Night of the Nominations  Program   Swiss Panorama  The \\"Swiss Panorama\\" section is the centrepiece of the Solothurn Film Festival. It presents a selection of current Swiss film productions of all genres and lengths from all four linguistic regions of Switzerland. The program reflects the diversity of filmmaking in Switzerland, encompassing documentary, fiction, experimental, short and animation films, as well as music clips. Final preparations before the Landhaus gets crowded  Rencontre  Every year the special ‚ÄúRencontre‚Äù program honours an individual whose work has played a significant role in Swiss filmmaking. The program presents a selection of film productions, while also enabling personal encounters. With ‚ÄúRencontre,‚Äù the Solothurn Film Festival offers the opportunity to gain in-depth insight into the works of well-known Swiss cineastes and to meet with them.

In Focus 2012, ten films were screened in a program called ‚ÄúBeyond cinema‚Äù (Jenseits des Kinos). The films explored the boundaries of classic cinema, examining closely the current audio-visual landscape at home and abroad to discover new narrative styles as well as atypical production and distribution forms. A panel discussion and workshop were also held in conjunction with the Focus program, prompting the exchange between experts and the audience. The Focus section evolved from the former Invitation section, which was geared to the cultural exchange and collaboration with the neighbouring regions in Europe. Initially, in the 1960s, individual directors from abroad were invited. By the 1990s entire guest countries were presented in Solothurn.  Supporting program  The festival's supporting program offers a diverse number of information events, special screenings for children, as well as theme-specific panel discussions and workshops examining issues concerning the Swiss film culture and film industry in collaboration with various Swiss film institutions and film associations. These events address current topics in Swiss film culture and are geared directly to filmmakers and those who take an active interest in film. One of the festival's signature features is the Film Club panel discussion: international film critics are invited to discuss current Swiss film productions.  Awards & Tributes  Numerous awards are presented at the Solothurn Film Festival.

High in the Stormberg Mountains, Molteno has recorded South Africa's coldest temperatures at the famous Buffelsfontein weather station and it is close to the country's only ski resort. Sutherland has the coldest average temperature throughout the year, whereas Molteno records the lowest temperatures in the winter months. History Founding Coal fields were discovered in this part of the Stormberg Mountains in 1859, and this created an economic incentive for development. The local people also stated a need for a settlement, to serve as a central hub for the surrounding rural area.D.W. Myburgh: The Origin of Towns in the Eastern Cape Midlands. University of Western Cape. Cape Town. 1978. p.30. The town was founded in 1874 by George Vice, and laid out the next year. The town was the setting of South Africa's first coal mine. Its name has connections both locally to the people of the Eastern Cape (Molteno is a surname among the Xhosa speaking people of the district),University of Cape Town, Manuscripts and Archives Department. BC330: Murray Collection, BC44-45: Sinclair Collection. but it also has Italian roots. At its founding, the town was officially named after an immigrant John Molteno, who had been born in London into a large Anglo-Italian family.Carlo Marvora: Molteno, memorie di famiglia. Italy: N.p.Lecco. 1978. Molteno became the first locally-elected leader of the Cape and fought against British imperial expansion in southern Africa.Molteno, routes.co.za, Retrieved 23 November 2009 Several of the town's streets are similarly named after the members of the Cape's first locally-elected cabinet.Johannes Meintjes (1964) Portret van 'n Suid-Afrikaanse Dorp.

Lowry Publishers. Johannesburg. 1987. p.314. Coal mining Soon after its founding, the town became the major supplier of coal to the region, with a large portion going to supply the diamond fields in Kimberley. It was granted municipal status in 1883, and by 1892 around 6000 tons of coal were being extracted at Molteno. Much of this coal went to supplying the Cape's rapidly growing railway system. In 1887, the newly founded Molteno Chamber of Commerce was influential in urging the Cape Government to extend its railway system northwards into the Boer republics, so as to open up new markets. By 1897, production of coal in the region had risen to over 70,000 tons.R.F. Immelman: Men of Good Hope. 1804-1954. The Cape Town Chamber of Commerce. 1955. However, by the 1920s the expansion of the railways made access to coal fields in Natal and the Transvaal possible, resulting in the decline of coal mining around Molteno. Boer War During the Second Boer War, Molteno was used as a mustering point for troops prior to the famous Battle of Stormberg, as it was the closest railway station. The area also saw extensive Boer guerilla activity. The Molteno struggle In the 20th century, growing oppression by the Apartheid government was met by resistance that manifested in the town as protests and battles between Molteno residents and police. When the Group Areas Act was enforced across South Africa in the 1960s, the mixed neighbourhoods in Molteno were destroyed and the entire town was divided. Some mixed neighbourhoods such as Esigingqini had their residents evicted, others such as Nomonde were delimited by enforced segregation. As a result, the overall town suffered a severe economic and social decline. Resistance came to a head on 12 August 1985, when local residents and students confronted the Apartheid police in the area around the town's Ethiopian Church. In the resulting battle, three local Molteno activists were shot and killed (R. Mbango, S. Loliwe, N. Smile). The town commemorates the activists and the 12 August date annually, as \\"Molteno Day\\". The following years saw other community activists of the town lose their lives in the struggle. After the fall of Apartheid, the town erected a monument in what was named \\"Heroes Park\\" in the town centre. The monument honours the local Molteno \\"comrades in blood\\" who \\"... shall forever be remembered by the people of Molteno and South Africa as a whole\\".CH District Municipality - Liberation Heritage Route Since liberation in 1993, the town has begun the task of reuniting its communities and reversing the damage it has sustained from decades of segregation and oppression.

Soon they had a daughter, but their daughter became sick due to a heart disorder. Yoo- hee, desperate to save her daughter, turned to her mother-in-law, who offered to pay for her granddaughter's operation under one condition. That condition required Yoo-hee to leave Sang-woo and never come back. Yoo-hee, wanting to save her daughter's life, left Sang-woo. Sang-woo, unaware of the reasons why Yoo-hee left him, eventually remarried Min Seo-hyun (Yoon Se-ah). Han Kang-soo (Kim Mu-yeol) has loved Yoo-hee since they were children.

He is noted as the first psychologist to examine the role of the race of the examiner as a bias factor in IQ testing.  Early life  Canady was born in 1901 in Okmulgee, Oklahoma, to Rev. Howard T and Mrs. Anna Canady. He attended Douglass Elementary School and Favor High School in Guthrie, Oklahoma. He graduated from the high school at George R. Smith College in Sedalia, Missouri in 1922. In 1923, Canady enrolled in the Northwestern University Theological School as a Charles F. Grey scholarship student, where he developed an interest in the behavioral sciences and majored in sociology. He began his education with the hopes of becoming a minister, however, after graduating in 1927 with a sociology major and a psychology minor, he continued his behavioral science studies at Northwestern, where he earned an M.A. in clinical psychology.Guthrie, R. (1998). Even the Rat was White: A historical view of psychology (2nd ed.). Boston: Allyn and Bacon.  Education  * 1927 B.A. sociology and a minor in psychology from Northwestern University * 1928 M.A. clinical psychology from Northwestern University * 1941 Ph.D. in psychology from Northwestern University  Career  In September 1928, Canady's career began when Francis Sumner left the position of chair of the psychology department at the West Virginia Collegiate Institute (now West Virginia State College). From 1936 to 1939, as chair of the psychology department at West Virginia, Canady conducted and published a plethora of socio-psychological studies. As a psychologist, one of his most monumental contributions was examining the role of the examiner or proctor in IQ testing. Canady's article in the Journal of Negro Education, titled \\"The Effect of 'rapport' on the I.Q.: A new approach to the problem of racial psychology\\", reported his findings in this area (that rapport between the examiner and the test-taker can have a significant impact on the results of the test) and offered suggestions to improve the situation. In 1939, a General Education Board fellowship allowed Canady to take a leave of absence from West Virginia to go back to Northwestern to complete his Ph.D. in psychology. After earning his doctorate in 1941, Canady returned to West Virginia as chairman, continuing his work as a psychologist. Outside of his accomplishments at West Virginia, Canady also taught as a visiting lecturer at schools and colleges in collaboration with the American Friends Committee in 1946. In 1947, he acted as a consultant for the Pacific Coast Council on Intercultural Education and Intercultural Projects in the San Diego School system. From 1948-1953 he worked part-time as a clinical psychologist for the Mental Health Unit at the Veterans Administration in Huntington, West Virginia, and from 1947-1968 he worked at the West Virginia Bureau of Mental Hygiene. Canady was also honored as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and Fellow of the American Psychological Association. He was a member of the American Teachers Association, the American Association of University Professors, the West Virginia State Psychological Association, the West Virginia Academy of Science, and the West Virginia State Teachers Association. Canady retired from West Virginia State University in 1968, after forty years as chair of the psychology department.  Movement to organize black psychologists  Canady's discontent with the lack of psychological research focused on the black experience led him to spearhead a movement to organize black professionals in psychology. In particular, Canady wished to draw more attention to the hardships faced by black youth and the obstacles to their employment. At this time, a psychology for black Americans did not exist. Rather, cross-cultural assumptions led to consideration of the problems of black Americans from the perspective of a psychology determined by white Americans. At this time, only a few black psychologists were members of the American Psychological Association, and the mission of the organization did not address the psychology of black Americans. As southern chapters of the National Educational Association (NEA) prohibited black teachers from joining the organization, black educators organized to form the American Teachers Association (ATA) (formerly called the National Association of Teachers in Colored Schools) in 1904. Through his membership in the ATA, Canady began to organize black psychologists. Canady composed A Prospectus of an Organization of Negroes Interested in Psychology and Related Fields and sent the document to ATA members who either worked in psychology or were interested in the cause. He proposed the formation of a psychology section within the ATA. The objective of the department would be \\"to advance, promote, and encourage the teaching and application of the science of psychology and related fields, particularly in Negro institutions.\\" Among many stated purposes, the prospectus proposed efforts to assist black institutions with the educational preparation and hiring of black psychologists. Additionally, the document proposed efforts specific to predominantly black institutions in order to cultivate interest in psychology amongst black students and to enhance research programs, including their emphasis on psychological problems as they pertain to black Americans. At the two-day ATA Tuskegee Convention held at the Tuskegee Institute in 1938, Canady presented his ideas to members of the organization and they unanimously voted for the formation of a Department of Psychology within the ATA. Canady was elected chairman of the group. At this conference, psychologists also contributed to discussion pertaining to the convention theme, \\"The Negro Youth Looks at Occupations in America.\\" Although World War II shifted attention away from Canady's efforts, psychologists organized thirty years later in San Francisco, California, in 1968 to discuss similar concerns. During an APA convention, about 200 black psychologists met to discuss the failure of the APA to address the role of blacks in psychological research. Joseph White, an influential black social psychologist, said that those present at the meeting were \\"dissatisfied with psychology's exploitations and the white definitions for behavior that placed Blacks in a negative light.\\" Selected works One of Canady's most influential articles was ‚ÄúThe Effect of ‚ÄòRapport‚Äô on the I.Q.: A New Approach to the Problem of Racial Psychology.‚Äù He was the first psychologist to address the effect of the race of the examiner on subjects taking I.Q tests. Canady questioned the reliability of tests given to Black children by White examiners due to effects of ‚Äúrapport.‚Äù He hypothesized that significant differences would exist between the I.Q. scores of Black children tested by a White as opposed to a Black examiner. The participants in Canady's study consisted of 48 Black and 25 White elementary school children from Evanston, Illinois. The Stanford Revision of the Binet-Simon measuring scale was administered to the children twice. The examiner conducting the second test was unaware of how the child scored on the first test. 23 Black subjects and 18 White subjects were tested first by a Black Examiner and again by a White examiner. The other subjects (25 Black and 7 White) were tested first by a White examiner and next by a Black examiner. The Black children's average gain in I.Q points when tested by a Black examiner was about the same as the White children's average drop in I.Q. points when tested by a Black examiner. This respective average gain and loss was about 6 points. 18% of subjects showed an increase or decrease of over 10 points. As other studies have reported changes of about 5 I.Q. points from one test to the next retest in children, as well as over 10 point changes in about 10-15% of cases, Canady concluded that the point differentials reported in his study could not be attributed to the races of the examiners. While Canady's study failed to demonstrate significant differences in I.Q. due to rapport with the examiner, his study spawned numerous future studies investigating effects of the race of the examiner on the results of the test-taker. There has been significant controversy as to whether the effects are significant. While many studies have found significant improvements in performance on intelligence tests when the test-taker is examined by a member of their own ethnic group,Moore, C., & Retish, P. (1974). Effect of the examiner's race on black children's Wechsler preschool and primary scale of intelligence IQ. Developmental Psychology, 10(5), 672-676.Thames, A., Hinkin, C., Byrd, D., Bilder, R., Duff, K., Mindt, M., Arentoft, A., Streiff, V. (2013). Effects of Stereotype Threat, Perceived Discrimination, and Examiner Race on Neuropsychological Performance: Simple as Black and White? Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society, 19, 583-593. many studies have also failed to substantiate this finding.Graziano, W., Varca, P., & Levy, J. (1982). Race of Examiner Effects and the Validity of Intelligence Tests. Review of Educational Research, 52(4), 469-497. Studies have found relationships between the race of the examiner and intelligence test scores for children with high mistrust of a member of an outgroup Terrell, F., & Terrell, S. (1983). The relationship between race of examiner, cultural mistrust, and the intelligence test performance of black children. Psychology in the Schools, 20(3), 367-369. Canady also attempted to bring attention to the current state of education in psychology at predominately black colleges. In his study, ‚ÄúPsychology in Negro Institutions,‚Äù he investigated the psychology programs at 40 of the top predominately black universities in nation. He evaluated the extent to which psychological education was available, as well as the undergraduate courses in psychology, the resources of the department, the faculty, and the research productivity. Questionnaires designed to obtain the above information were sent to administrators at the most well-respected 50 predominately black colleges in the country. 47 colleges agreed to participate in the study. Results indicated that only 30% of the institutions had psychology departments, while the other 70% combined psychology departments with education, philosophy, or sociology. Only 4 of the 47 institutions offered a major in psychology. The remaining institutions reported that they did not have enough psychology courses or trained psychologists to offer the major. While the APA recommended a full- year introductory psychology course at the time, most of the institutions surveyed only offered half-year introductory courses. Despite the importance of exposing psychology students to experimental methods, only one institution required laboratory work as part of introductory psychology courses. Many of the institutions reported that they would mandate laboratory work if they had adequate resources. Only two institutions offered a Race Psychology course. Of the 32.6% of instructors teaching psychology courses who were trained in psychology, only 30% held doctorate degrees in psychology. Only 8 of the 88 total psychology instructors at the institutions had published significant research in the past five years. Additionally, Canady suggested that, while many of the courses taught across the nation pertained to applied psychology, too few addressed issues of theoretical psychology.Canady, H. (1938). Psychology in Negro Institutions. The Journal of Negro Education, 7(2), 165-171. In his research, Canady also drew attention to false beliefs regarding gender differences. In ‚ÄúA Study of Sex Differences in Intelligence- Test Scores Among 1,306 Negro College Freshmen,‚Äù American Council Psychological Examinations of 637 males and 669 females who attended West Virginia State College were analyzed. Canady concluded that there were no significant differences in ‚Äúgeneral intelligence‚Äù between the males and females. He did find significant differences between male and female performance in the sub-tests included in the intelligence test. The males outperformed the females in numerical sections of the test while females outperformed males on verbal sections of the test.Canady, H. (1943). A Study of Sex Differences in Intelligence-Test Scores Among 1,306 Negro College Freshmen. The Journal of Negro Education, 12(2), 167-172.  Legacy  Through publications such as ‚ÄúAdapting Education to the Abilities, Needs, and Interests of Negro College Students‚Äù and ‚ÄúPsychology in Negro Institutions‚Äù, Canady contributed to efforts to increase educational opportunities for Black students and fought to attain equal rights for Black Americans. Furthermore, his role in organizing Black psychologists in the 1930s led to the formation of the Department of Psychology within the ATA. This event was crucial to the development of a Black Psychology in the United States. Prior to the gathering of Black psychologists at the ATA conference in Tuskegee, Alabama, the issues faced by Black Americans were mainly considered from the perspective of a White-centric psychology. Echoes of Canady's work can be seen in the current psychological theory of intergroup anxiety. One proposed cause of intergroup anxiety cites perceived negative stereotypes leading members of an ingroup to experience anxiety when interacting with a member of the outgroup.Levine, J., & Hogg, M. (2010). Intergroup Anxiety. In Encyclopedia of Group Processes & Intergroup Relations. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Reference. pp. 465‚Äì468. Thus, if a Black child mistrusts Whites and perceives them as threatening, they may experience increased anxiety when interacting with a white examiner, leading to poor performance on a test. Canady's study, ‚ÄúThe Effect of ‚ÄòRapport‚Äô on the I.Q.: A New Approach to the Problem of Racial Psychology‚Äù was the first to address the issue of the race of the examiner as it interacts with children's performance on I.Q. tests.Canady, H. (1936). The Effect of ‚ÄúRapport‚Äù on the I.Q.: A New Approach to the Problem of Racial Psychology. The Journal of Negro Education, 5(2), 209-219. Furthermore, studies building off of Canady's original study have found significant relationships between Black children's mistrust of Whites and poorer test performances when tested by White as opposed to Black examiners. Traces of Canady's work can also be seen in stereotype threat research. Stereotype threat has been demonstrated to increase when identification with a negatively stereotyped group leads to the expectation of discrimination. According to stereotype threat theory, if the presence of a White examiner were to activate stereotype threat in Black children and led to the expectation of discrimination, their performance on intelligence tests would decrease.Steele, C., Spencer, S., & Aronson, J. (2002). Contending with group image: The psychology of stereotype and social identity threat. Advances in Experimental Social Psychology Advances in Experimental Social Psychology Volume 34, 379-440. This result is predicted by Canady in his study investigating the effect of ‚Äúrapport‚Äù between White examiners and Black children.  Family  He married Julia Witten in 1934 and together they had two children, Joyce A. and Herman G. Canady.

He was born in 1960 into the family of Japhar Jabbarly, an Azerbaijani playwright, one of the founders of Azerbaijan theatre and cinema whose name was given to the Azerbaijan state film studio \\"Azerbaijanfilm\\". Professional career Early start Mahmud Salah started his professional activity at the age of sixteen performing with the ensemble of national musical instruments of the Azerbaijan State TV and Radio Company. Since 1990, he has been a soloist Qhaval (daf) performer in the orchestra of Azerbaijani national musical instruments, and in the same time since 1991 he has been working at the Azerbaijan State Opera and Ballet Theatre and National symphonic orchestra. Later career Between 1989 and 2005 he initiated and founded a few mugham ensembles ‚Äì trio \\"Buta\\" with Qhaval, kamancha, and tar (1989), trio \\"Ghadim Sharq\\" (2000), instrumental quartet, Shajara (2001‚Äì2005) and an instrumental quartet \\"Ghadim Sharq Roubaii\\" (2003) with qhaval, tar, qanun, and kamancha. Tar and Qhaval are the permanent members of all mugham ensembles founded by Mahmud Salah. These instruments now constitute the core of the group \\"Ghadim Sharq\\". In this ensembles, Mahmud Salah performs Qhaval, Elman Sadiqov played Tar (1998‚Äì2007) and Ilqar Azizov is performing Tar now. They attract different khanendes (traditional singers) for their public performance. This flexibility reflects common practice of mugham performance, rooted in old tradition. Mahmud Salah works also at the Azerbaijan National Conservatoire and at the Azerbaijan State Institute of Arts where he teaches qhaval performing to traditional singers (khanendes). The names of his former students (Melek-khanim Ayyubova, Simara Imanova (winner of the first festival of oriental songs in Samarqand), Nazaket Teymurova, Aygun Bayramova, Mansoum Ibrahimov) are widely known now to both Azerbaijani and foreign audience and new generation, Tayyar Bayramov (winner of the International mugham symposium), Qochaq Askerov(the best of the oriental songs festival in Samarqand) and Babak Neftaliev (star of mugham). As a performer, Mahmud Salah is considered as the best ghaval player in Azerbaijan. His name is mentioned in many books on Azerbaijan national musical instruments written by local and foreign authors. Professor of the Northwestern University (Illinois, United States) Inna Naroditskaya in her book \\"Songs from the Land of Fire\\" (2003) dedicated to Azerbaijani traditional musical culture expresses her gratitude to Mahmud Salah \\"for his patience and enthusiasm in teaching me to play the ghaval in 2002\\". His qhaval (daf) performance is placed on the compact disk (sound track 2) appendixes to her book. Sanobar Baghirova (member of American Etnomusicalists Association and International music council as the Azerbaijani member ) was written in her book, Azerbaijani Mugham, pearls of humans folklore heritage, about compositions of Mahmud Salah in chahargah and unusual performance in rengs, tasnifs and daramds even performing qhaval in mugham as a soloist. Mahmud Salah performed with such renowned Azerbaijani traditional musicians, as a famous khanende (traditional singer), khanendes Arif Babayev, UNESCO prize winner Alim Qasimov, Janali Akberov, Aghakhan Abdullayev and Sakine Ismailova, professors and assistant professor of Azerbaijan National Conservatoire, tar performers Ramiz Quliyev, Agha Salim Addullayev, Mohlat Muslimov, Malik Mansurov, kamancha performers Shafiga Eyvazova, Adalat Vazirov, Fahraddin Dadashev, Elshan Mansourov. a garmon player, a laureate of the 36th annual Smithsonian \\"Folklife\\" festival of 2002, Aydin Aliyev, and with many others. In 1987 he performed with Alim Qasimov at the International Festival in Samarqand where their group was awarded the first prize. In ensemble with Azerbaijani instrumentalists Ramiz Quliyev (tar) Mohlat Muslimov (tar), Fahraddin Dadashev, Shafiga Eyvazova (kamancha) and khanendes, such as Aghakhan Abdullayev, Janali Akberov, Melek Khanim Ayyubova, Qandab Quliyeva, his performance was recorded on the series of compact disks \\"Anthology of Azerbaijani Traditional Music\\" released in France in the 1990s. In 1997 in France Buda Musique released a CD with Malik Mansurov and Mahmud Salah's performance \\"Azerbaidjan: Le Tar de Malik Mansurov\\", Musique du Monde, 1997, CD 92696-2, BUDA Musique, Paris, France] and a CD with Aydin Aliyev and Mahmud Salah's recordings. \\"Azerbaidjan: Le Garmon de Aydin Aliev\\", Musique du Monde, 1997, CD 92701-2, BUDA Musique, Paris, France. Four of his latest CDs were released by two Turkish companies ‚Äì two by RAKS (2003) with Khanende Sakine Ismailova and two more by the studio \\"Boyuk Shahinler\\" (2005), one with his solo performance. Numerous of his CDs were released by local Azerbaijani studios. Mahmud Salah is widely known also as a tar reformer and a connoisseur of old mugham repertoire. The tar he reformed in the 90s since 1998 has sounded publicly; it has already got its own place in history of Azerbaijani tar construction and performing practice. A few documentaries of this new tar were taken by different local and foreign TV channels, for instance, by Turkish TRT2 in 2002, by the \\"Leader\\" Azerbaijani private channel in 2004, and by the Azerbaijan State TV & Radio company in 2005. This tar also named Sharqi tar(oriental tar) is mentioned in \\"Explanatory Dictionary of Azerbaijan musical instruments\\" compiled by A. Najafzade (Baku, 2003). This tar (accompanied by M. Salah's daf performance) sounded at the stage of the international music festival \\"Sharq taranalari\\" held under the auspice of UNESCO in Samarqand in 2005 and 2009. The US Professor of Montana University, Thomas Goltz produced a film about Mahmud Salah and his ensemble Qhadim Sharq when they were in Montana. Mugham in Montana (Directed Thomas Goltz) or The Mystical Music of Mugham comes to Montana won an Award of Merit in the short film, documentary category at the La Jolla California‚Äôs 2009 Accolade Film Festival Competition in August 2009. Qhadim Sharq as one of the best known Azeri ensembles has performed many programs at local and international TV and radio. BBC Radio 3 2007 (the First Azeri music performance), SWR2 in 2008, Channal Europe in 2008, Turkish and Azerbaijani channels. Also was performed many of concerts in United States (April 2007), Germany (October 2007). As a composer, Mahmud Salah is less known among the general public because he composes music in the traditional and folk musical genres (tasnifs, rangs, daramads, dances), and, according to mugham tradition, this creativity usually stays anonymous among traditional musicians and public. However, all the mugham compositions arranged by Mahmud Salah usually include his own pieces or rhythmical melodic episodes within canonized mugham improvisations.

The species was first described by Carl Geyer in 1832. It is found in the eastern United States, including Delaware, Virginia, Mississippi and Florida. Its habitat consists of wet pine flatwoods and pine savannas. The length of the forewings is 13‚Äì15.5 mm for males and 14.5‚Äì16 mm for females. Adults can usually be identified by the narrower dark stripe on the forewing and their relatively small size. Compared to Doryodes spadaria the medial longitudinal stripe on the forewing is much narrower and the hindwings are whitish not buff through June emergences. Adults are on wing from April to October in North Carolina, and throughout the year in Florida. The larvae feed on Aristida stricta.

This name is an Anatolian version of the name of Barbara (a female name). It is thought to have been an Ottoman Greek village before the establishment of the Republic of Turkey. However, there is no evidence except its name in favor of this claim.  Population and economy  The population is approximately 1,000. The economy is mostly based on agriculture. The main product is hazelnuts and the income level is insufficient to survive. It is because of this that many people have emigrated from the village for economic opportunities.

With northern and central W√ºrttemberg being part of the American occupation zone from 1945 to 1949, it was the U.S. Information Control Division that issued the first publishing licence to the editors Josef Eberle, Karl Ackermann and Henry Bernhard during the first years of the paper's existence.

St. Peter's is situated in the N√¶stved parish of the Diocese of Roskilde of the Church of Denmark. The church is one of Denmark's foremost Gothic buildings. History The church was first documented in a monasterial letter from 1135. Today's Gothic church replaced an older Romanesque cross-shaped building built of limestone and brick from the second half of the 12th century. This in turn was built on the site of an even older stone church with two western towers. In 1375, the extension to the present Gothic church began. Built of red brick, it is one of Denmark's largest and finest Gothic buildings, scarcely altered since 1375. The chancel, with its five tall windows, is particularly impressive. The church has undergone several restorations, including one from 1852 to 1856 by the architects Niels Sigfred Nebelong and Georg Kretz, and again from 1883 to 1885 by the architects Johan Daniel Herholdt and Vilhelm Ahlmann.N√¶stved Sct Peters Kirke.

There are several uncovered frescoes in the church by lime painter Morten Maler whose frescoes also appear at Gerlev Church (Gerlev kirke) and Gimlinge Church (Gimlinge Kirke) in Slagelse. The most imposing feature of the church is the pulpit, designed by Lorentz J√∏rgensen of Holb√¶k in 1671. Two rows of choir stalls and a bronze font date back to about 1500. The altarpiece is headed by a late-Gothic arched crucifix which the church received in 1844 from nearby Fodby Church (Fodby kirke). The tower clock dates to 1736 and is the work of J.D.

Its only species, Euparthenos nubilis, the locust underwing, was first described by Jacob H√ºbner in 1823. The adults resemble some of the underwing moths of genus Catocala, which are fairly close relatives, in color, pattern, and the habit of resting on tree trunks. But E. nubilis can usually be immediately recognized by the four concentric black bands per hindwing, as opposed to one or two (at most three) in Catocala. Color morphs of E. nubilis with altered pattern are known, however, and these may be hard to recognize without detailed examination.Nelson & Loy (1983), and see references in Savela (2019) This moth has light grey forewings with a pattern of darker grey and brown lines and shading. The hindwings are yellow orange with the aforementioned four black bands each. The wingspan is 56‚Äì70 mm (over 2 to almost 3 inches.BugGuide (2013) The species is found in North America from Maine, Ontario and Quebec, south to northern Florida, west to Nebraska and Arizona. Adults are on wing from April to September. There are two generations per year. The larvae feed on Robinia (locust tree) species, such as black locust (R. pseudoacacia). The adults like to drink the juice of fermenting fruit, and are attracted to lights. Systematics and taxonomy Classification The species and genus were previously classified in the subfamily Catocalinae of the family Noctuidae and in the tribe Ophiusini of the family Erebidae.See references in Savela (2019) Subspecies The species has the following described subspecies.See references in Savela (2019) * Euparthenos nubilis apache (Poling, 1901) * Euparthenos nubilis nubilis (H√ºbner, 1823) * Euparthenos nubilis osiris Barnes & Benjamin, 1926 Synonyms The junior synonyms of this moth are: * Genus-level:  Catocalirrhus Andrews, 1877  Parthenos H√ºbner, 1823 (non H√ºbner, 1819: preoccupied) * Species-level:  Euparthenos faciata (Beutenm√ºller, 1907)  Euparthenos unilineata (Chermock & Chermock, 1940) (morph) Footnotes References Nelson, John M. & Loy, Peter W.

Life  Salus studied medicine in Prague and established a practice in gynaecology there from 1895 onwards. Apart from his professional activities as a doctor, he published numerous volumes of poetry and short stories, and was one of the more important exponents of German-Jewish literature in the Prague of his day, moving in a circle which included younger figures of the stature of Franz Kafka, Max Brod, Franz Werfel, Egon Erwin Kisch, Oskar Baum, Johannes Urzidil, Paul Kornfeld, Ernst Weiss and Kamil Hoffmann. Several of his works were illustrated by Heinrich Vogeler, while Arnold Sch√∂nberg set two of his poems to music. A prolific author, he soon became 'the acknowledged arbiter of Prague literary taste', and 'the most respected Bohemian poet writing in German' at the time. An early friend and mentor of Rainer Maria Rilke, his verse had some influence on Rilke's early lyric style. To some of his fellow Jewish intellectuals, he was regarded as an unadulterated \\"assimilationist,\\" and \\"a militant protagonist of German liberalism and Jewish assimilation\\" whose attachment to Zionism was little more than a matter of embracing a fashionable trend (Mode- Zionismus). Lothar Kahn, on the other hand, says that while Salus was described by Max Brod as an unqualified assimilationist, \\"this may be an exaggeration, Salus did hope, all else failing, for full Jewish absorption into the host society.\\" Of both him and his rival Friedrich Adler, Kafka biographer Peter Mailloux says, \\"their Jewishness existed in name only.\\" The philosopher Emil Utitz put it a bit differently, \\"Both acknowledged Jews, they nevertheless felt themselves to be the authentic representatives of all Germans in Bohemia, as well as further afield. Those Germans wanted little to do with Prague in any case, and least of all with its Jews. But Salus and Adler were liberals of the old stamp.\\" Prague Territories: National Conflict and Cultural Innovation in Franz Kafka Scott Spector Kahn notes that \\"Salus made use of Jewish folkways and observances in his poetry, plays, and occasional fiction.\\"  Works (a selection)   Poems  * Gedichte. 1898 * Neue Gedichte. 1899 * Ehefr√ºhling. 1900 * Reigen. 1900 * Christa.

Two prototypes were built but both were destroyed by tail flutter. Design and development The Pipit was Parnall's submission to Air Ministry specification 21/26, which called for a single-seat shipborne fighter. The same specification attracted a version of the Vickers 141, modified from the original landplane fighter and the private venture Hawker Hoopoe The specification required operation off deck or water. The Pipit was a single-bay biplane with staggered, equal-span wings, unswept and of constant chord. The upper wing only carried dihedral; the ailerons were on the lower wing, extending over most of the span. There was a large rounded cutout in the upper wing over the cockpit for visibility, since the pilot's head was immediately below the trailing edge. Because of the stagger, he sat ahead of the lower trailing edge and so there were a pair of cutouts in the lower wings, a little way out from the roots, to assist downward vision. Apart from the stainless-steel N-shaped interplane struts, the wings were duralumin structures, fabric covered. The lower wing was fixed near the bottom of the fuselage and the upper one supported above it by four outward-leaning centre- section struts. The Pipit's fuselage was constructed from stainless steel tubes braced with duralumin struts. The 495 hp (370 kW) Rolls-Royce F.XI watercooled V-12 was housed in a refined, streamlined aluminium cowling. Behind the cockpit the fuselage was fabric covered, as was the empennage, which had a stainless steel structure. The fin was tall and rounded, carrying a rudder which was neither aerodynamically nor dynamically balanced. The tailplane was attached at mid-fuselage and was rather rectangular, carrying split elevators which were horn balanced. A retractable radiator, deployed via a handwheel in the cockpit, was mounted under the nose. When retracted this radiator warmed the cockpit and it was claimed that there would be no need for electrically heated clothing in the open cockpit, even at 20,000 ft (6,100 m) in winter. There were air vents for cooling the cockpit in summer and also a skin-type ancillary radiator built into the upper wing centre section surface. The land undercarriage was of the single-axle type, with forward-leaning oleo legs to the lower fuselage ahead of the leading edge and rearward struts. The wheels incorporated servo-assisted brakes operated from the rudder bar. The land- and seaplane undercarriages were designed to be rapidly interchangeable and shared the same attachment points, though the oleo legs were moved aft for the floats and there were additional bracing struts forward from their feet to the fuselage. The floats, linked by a pair of horizontal struts, were duralumin with a single step and water rudder. The pilot's view was good, particularly over the nose, important for deck landings. The Pipit was armed with a pair of Vickers machine guns, mounted at seat level and firing via troughs in the fuselage sides. The Pipit prototype, N232, first flew sometime in the summer of 1928. In October it flew to the A&AAE; at RAF Martlesham Heath for official trials. During that month, the Pipit was put into a terminal-velocity dive during which tail flutter set in and became so violent that the tailplane spar fractured. The aircraft was a complete writeoff, but the pilot survived, despite a broken neck, to fly again. The loss was a severe blow to Parnall's, who had staked a lot on the hope of getting a production order for the promising Pipit. A second prototype was built, as the first but with distinguishing modifications. It was allocated the serial N233 but, confusingly, was painted with the same serial as the first prototype. The tailplane was now braced on each underside with a pair of struts, the fin and rudder had a less smoothly-rounded shape largely because of the addition of a large horn balance and there were now ailerons on all wings, linked between upper and lower planes by an external rod. This aircraft began testing at the Parnall factory field at Yate early in 1929, but on 24 FebruaryMason gives this date. Wixey gives two different ones, both in February: 14th (p.230) and 17th (p.173) the Pipit encountered flutter strong enough to break the fin and rudder from the fuselage. The aircraft was lost, but the pilot escaped by parachute.Mason, Francis K., \\"The British Fighter since 1912\\", Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, Maryland, 1992, Library of Congress card number 92-63026, , p. 207. After the failure of the Pipit, Parnall never received a production order for a military aircraft and never submitted a front-line prototype again, though they did compete for the trainer specification Air Ministry specification T.1/37 with the Parnall Heck III. The Pipit crashes did contribute to a better understanding of flutter and how to prevent it, with wind-tunnel models and a detailed study of the two cases published in 1930. A subsequent and more general report came out of a research program which reported in 1931 with an emphasis on structural stiffness and above all careful mass (dynamic) balancing.

Early life Bryan was born in London on 4 October 1969, the youngest of seven children of immigrant parents from Barbados. He attended Shaftesbury Junior School in Forest Gate, before attending Trinity Secondary School in Canning Town. He left school aged 14 or 15 and obtained employment at a clothes stall, later moving on to teach cooking lessons at his local soup kitchen. Background In 1987 Peter Bryan lived in the Flying Angel, Custom House, East London. It was here that he attempted to throw another resident from his sixth floor window. There was a struggle and his intended victim escaped, leaving Bryan with a deep gash to the head. The initial attack by Bryan was totally unprovoked. The victim was questioned by the police about the gash on Bryan's head but no further action was taken by the police against the victim or Bryan. He was later sent to Rampton Secure Hospital in 1994 after admitting the unlawful killing of 21-year-old shop assistant Nisha Sheth, who was beaten to death with a hammer in 1993. By February 2001 the nursing staff thought he had made considerable progress in regard to his \\"behaviour, attitude, maturity, relationships, anger and insight.\\" Bryan was transferred from Rampton in June 2001 to the John Howard Centre after a six-month trial leave project agreed by the Home Office. He was released into the care of a psychiatrist and social worker. After applying to a Mental Health Review Tribunal in 2002, he was moved to the Riverside Hostel in north London where he was allowed door keys and could come and go as he pleased. Psychiatrists and social workers were remarking that there had been a \\"continued improvement\\" in his behaviour. In October 2003 psychiatrists noted there had been \\"a continued improvement in his mental state\\" and talked of plans for a move to more independent accommodation. In November 2003 his mental health social worker wrote to the Home Office stating that matters had settled down and there were no further concerns. It was thought that he \\"did not present any major risks.\\" In January 2004 social workers applied for the transfer of Bryan to \\"low‚Äìsupport accommodation\\"; instead, Bryan was transferred to an open psychiatric ward at Newham General Hospital for his safety after allegations that he had indecently assaulted a 16-year-old girl close to the hostel. In February 2004 he walked out of the mental health unit in Newham, East London, and killed friend Brian Cherry. Police were called after neighbours heard screams, and weapons, including a hammer, were found strewn around the flat. When police caught up with him, he was cooking the dead man's brain in a frying pan. Bryan was remanded to Broadmoor Hospital after appearing in court over Mr Cherry's death. Two months later, while on remand in Broadmoor, Bryan killed his third victim, fellow patient Richard Loudwell, aged 60. He battered him on the head and tied a ligature around his neck. Mr Loudwell died in hospital later that day. Bryan said that if he had not been interrupted he would have eaten Loudwell's flesh. Trial On 15 March 2005, Bryan pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to two manslaughters on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Judge Giles Forrester said: \\"You killed on these last two occasions because it gave you a thrill and a feeling of power when you ate flesh.\\" Bryan, who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia and is a self-confessed cannibal, was committed to Broadmoor Hospital for treatment.

The well-known histogram equalization method is a special case in which the specified histogram is uniformly distributed. It is possible to use histogram matching to balance detector responses as a relative detector calibration technique. It can be used to normalize two images, when the images were acquired at the same local illumination (such as shadows) over the same location, but by different sensors, atmospheric conditions or global illumination.  Implementation  Consider a grayscale input image X. It has a probability density function pr(r), where r is a grayscale value, and pr(r) is the probability of that value. This probability can easily be computed from the histogram of the image by p_r (r_j )= {n_j \\\\over n} Where nj is the frequency of the grayscale value rj, and n is the total number of pixels in the image. Now consider a desired output probability density function pz(z). A transformation of pr(r) is needed to convert it to pz(z). Input image CDF matched to desired output CDF Each pdf (probability density function) can easily be mapped to its cumulative distribution function by : S(r_k )= \\\\sum_{j=0}^k p_r(r_j),\\\\qquad k = 0,1,2,3,\\\\ldots : G(z_k )= \\\\sum_{j=0}^k p_z(z_j),\\\\qquad k = 0,1,2,3,\\\\ldots,L Where L is the total number of gray level (256 for a standard image). The idea is to map each r value in X to the z value that has the same probability in the desired pdf. I.e. S(rj) = G(zi) or z = G‚àí1(S(r)).  Example  The following input grayscale image is to be changed to match the reference histogram. 439x439px The input image has the following histogram none It will be matched to this reference histogram to emphasize the lower gray levels. Desired reference histogramAfter matching, the output image has the following histogramHistogram of output image after matchingAnd looks like thisOutput image after histogram matching Algorithm Given two images, the reference and the target images, we compute their histograms. Following, we calculate the cumulative distribution functions of the two images' histograms ‚Äì F_1()\\\\, for the reference image and F_2()\\\\, for the target image. Then for each gray level G_1\\\\in[0,255], we find the gray level G_2\\\\, for which F_1(G_1)=F_2(G_2)\\\\,, and this is the result of histogram matching function: M(G_1)=G_2\\\\,. Finally, we apply the function M() on each pixel of the reference image. Exact histogram matching In typical real-world applications, with 8-bit pixel values (discrete values in range [0, 255]), histogram matching can only approximate the specified histogram. All pixels of a particular value in the original image must be transformed to just one value in the output image. Exact histogram matching is the problem of finding a transformation for a discrete image so that its histogram exactly matches the specified histogram. Several techniques have been proposed for this. One simplistic approach converts the discrete-valued image into a continuous- valued image and adds small random values to each pixel so their values can be ranked without ties. However, this introduces noise to the output image. Because of this there may be holes or open spots in the output matched histogram. Multiple histogram matching The histogram matching algorithm can be extended to find a monotonic mapping between two sets of histograms. Given two sets of histograms P=\\\\\\\\{p_i\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^k and Q = \\\\\\\\{q_i \\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^k , the optimal monotonic color mapping M is calculated to minimize the distance between the two sets simultaneously, namely \\\\operatorname{argmin}_M \\\\sum_k d(M(p_k),q_k) where d(\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot) is a distance metric between two histograms. The optimal solution is calculated using dynamic programming.

History In 1086 the Craven section of the Domesday Book lists Utelaia as owned by the Viking Vilts. He was taxed on about of arable ploughland here. He also owned Newsholme but shared Oakworth with Gamel Bern. It has been suggested that the name means oat field or outfield (of Keighley) or that it was a meadow (Ley) owned by Utta. Utley was a small collection of buildings when the Keighley to Skipton Turnpike opened up in the early 18th century. The road became the dividing line between Low and High Utley and in the 1930s, the road became the A629 road. The A629 was downgraded into the B6265 when the A629 Kildwick to Beechcliffe bypass was opened in August 1988. In 2001 the area had a population of 5,000 which had risen to 5,500 by the 2011 census. Facilities It has a large secondary school on Greenhead Lane (University Academy Keighley), and previously had a primary school on the same road. Utley also has a local newsagents, pub, restaurant, a children's park in the Beechcliffe area and a Fish and chip shop that was named as one of the best 50 chip shops in Britain for three years running between 2014 and 2016. Within Utley is a large cemetery covering . The cemetery is the final resting place for many people from Utley and Keighley, including surrounding villages such as Riddlesden and Steeton and is the oldest cemetery maintained by Bradford Council having been opened in 1857. Near to the cemetery, just across the River Aire, is Keighley Golf Club, an 18-hole private members course. Transport The road access to Utley is via the B6265 road (Skipton Road) which runs through it and on to Steeton. Local buses are mostly provided by Burnley Bus Company and Keighley Bus Company with a handful of journeys by Jackson's of Silsden. Utley was formerly a terminus on the Keighley Tramways Corporation line from Ingrow via Keighley town centre. Originally the trams were horse-drawn and gave way to electric trams in 1904. The network closed in 1924 to be replaced by buses.

It only aired once on October 31, 1983 at 10:30 P.M. The only other times it was shown was as part of the Tim Burton retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, and the Tim Burton L'Exposition at the Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise in Paris as part of a traveling exhibit. Plot The film features an entirely East Asian cast as the eponymous characters: a poor toy-maker (played by Jim Ishida), his son, Hansel, and daughter, Gretel (played by Andy Lee and Allison Hong), and his wicked new wife (played by Michael Yama), who overtly despises her stepchildren. One evening at dinner, Hansel and Gretel decide to tease their stepmother. She becomes so fed up of their games that she attempts to beat them up, but their father stops her, having her send them into their attic bedroom instead. Their father waits until his cruel wife is asleep and goes into the attic with a small clown puppet he'd made and a few cookies he'd sneaked for them to cheer the children up. He then puts the children to bed and sets down a small swan toy before turning into bed himself. The next morning, the stepmother decides to take Hansel and Gretel for a walk in the labyrinthine forest. Certain that the children would be unable to find their way out on their own, she abandons them by tossing a small firework toy in the children's path to distract them. Unbeknownst to their wicked stepmother, Gretel had told Hansel to pick up a pile of small stones near the house and drop them so they may find their way home, knowing their stepmother's plot. The children manage to find their way back home that same evening using the stones Hansel had dropped. While their father is in town selling his toys the next morning, the children's stepmother, unhappy with their return, decides to take the children on another walk in the woods. Before leaving the house, she gives the children a toy duck, telling them it is one of their father's toys. The children, not trusting their stepmother, once again leave a trail of stones behind them on their path. As they walked, the toy duck they were dragging had, unbeknownst to them, been eating the stone trail they left along the way. Once again they find themselves deserted in the woods, but this time with no direction home. Hansel and Gretel have no choice but to sleep in the woods that night. As they slept, the toy duck slowly transforms into a small toy robot which leads them to a house made of gingerbread and candy. As the children eat the house's fa√ßade, the candy cane-nosed witch who lives within the gingerbread house lures them inside with the promise of sweets. The witch brings the children to her dining table where an enormous cake sits, adorned with small cutouts of Hansel and Gretel. When the children try to eat the cake, they find that it is only a decoration. The witch then tells them the furniture and even the walls of the house are real candy, which the children happily and greedily enjoy. The witch, seemingly upset with herself for not thinking how tired the children must be, bring Hansel and Gretel upstairs to a large bedroom with two giant marshmallow beds for them to sleep in. They lie in the two beds the witch prepared and are immediately captured by the now living beds. Hansel escapes for a moment before the witch catches him once more and drops him back on the bed. The bed then reveals a mouth-like doorway in the wall which drops Hansel into a cavernous room with a strange mobile hanging down from the ceiling. The mobile drops what appears at first to be a large lump of dough which emerges from behind the boy as a creepy clown-like gingerbread man named Dan Dan. Dan Dan insists that Hansel eat him and begins driving Hansel crazy with his incessant screaming on the matter. Finally, Hansel takes Dan Dan's head, the one part he refused to eat, and throws him into the wall, shattering Dan Dan to pieces. The witch, by this point, had taken Gretel down to the kitchen to begin heating the oven to cook Hansel. The witch pulls a chain hanging from her ceiling which causes two long arms to drop from the mobile above Hansel and bring him back up to the kitchen so she could begin baking him. Before the witch can shove Hansel into her oven, however, Gretel grabs the fire iron beside the oven and hits the witch in the back with it. Enraged, the witch fights Gretel in a kung fu-style battle while Hansel breaks free to join the fight. The children, seeing the oven has opened once more, lure the witch to them. As they stand before the roaring furnace, the witch takes a flying kick in their direction, flinging herself accidentally into her own oven. Hansel and Gretel lock the witch inside the oven as the house begins to melt and ooze with frosting. Hansel and Gretel narrowly escape the melting house and watch as it becomes no more than a river of melted candy. Suddenly, the toy swan their father had given them the evening before appears on the melted candy river in the form of a small boat and leads the children back home to their happy father. He explains that he forced their wicked stepmother to leave their home, fed up with her want to get rid of his children. As the children celebrate with their father, the swan boat begins to spout gold coins from its mouth, thus providing them with the wealth they have needed.

The film's design style and color schemes paid homage to the Godzilla movies and features heavy special effects such as front projection, forced perspective and even some stop-motion animation. Though some sources claim the film runs a full 45 minutes, the version released on YouTube is 34 minutes and 17 seconds (with the credits cut off). This is due to the film being paired with Tim Burton's Vincent short film and various bumpers, and Vincent Price's introduction during its original airing. Screenings A New York Times article states that the special was screened at Museum of Modern Art as part of a Tim Burton special exhibition which ran from November 22, 2009 to April 26, 2010.

He was born in Trondheim as a son of Torbj√∏rn Torstensen Lindholt (1916‚Äì1982) and Ruth Borgny Lund (1922‚Äì2001). He was the oldest of eight children. He graduated from the University of Oslo with a cand.oecon. degree in 1967, and worked as a research fellow from 1968 to 1971. He had short spells in Kreditkassen from 1971 to 1972 and the Ministry of Finance from 1973 to 1974, but mainly worked as an associate professor at the University of Oslo from 1972. He has later stated that he was too \\"restless\\" to pursue an academic career. He was a member of the Labour Party, and was appointed as a private secretary (today known as political advisor) in the Ministry of Transport and Communications between 1976 and 1978 as a part of Nordli's Cabinet. In 1978 he was a secretary for the Labour Party parliamentary group for a few months before being hired as chief financial officer in the Norwegian State Railways. When Robert Nord√©n left as director-general in 1987, Tore Lindholt became acting director-general until 1988. The same thing happened in 1990, when Kjeld Rimberg resigned after two years in the position, only that the position had changed its name from director-general to president. Board chairman Arne Rettedal was not a supporter of Lindholt. In 1990, Lindholt released the book Avsporing. Kampen om NSB, about the inner circles of the State Railways. In it, he described Rettedal in a less favourable way. Also, according to Lindholt, he got his first spell as acting director-general (1987‚Äì1988) because Minister of Transport Kjell Borgen took a personal initiative, unbeknownst to Lindholt, to remove Robert Nord√©n (Lindholt, Borgen and Nord√©n were politicians for the Labour Party). Borgen announced his intentions to Lindholt over the telephone. After leaving the State Railways, Lindholt was the chief executive officer of Folketrygdfondet from 1990 to 2004. He has also been deputy board chairman of Narvesen.

Although never a common name, Caeso was regularly used by a number of prominent families, both patrician and plebeian, during the period of the Roman Republic. The feminine form is Caesula (also spelled Cesula, Caesulla, Caesilla, and Caesillia). The name also gave rise to the patronymic gens Caesonia. Kaeso is the older spelling, dating from the period when the letter K was still frequently used before the vowel A in Latin, and before the letters C and G were differentiated.Dictionary of Greek & Roman Biography & MythologyMika Kajava, Roman Female Praenomina: Studies in the Nomenclature of Roman Women (1994) The praenomen Caeso was regularly used by the patrician gentes Fabia and Quinctia during the 1st centuries of the Republic, and also by the plebeian gentes Atilia and Duilia (both of which may originally have been patrician). It is also found in the gentes Acilia, Fabricia, and Latria, and must once have been used by the ancestors of gens Caesonia. Its use gradually declined throughout Republican times, and seems to have fallen out of use around the 1st century AD.George Davis Chase, \\"The Origin of Roman Praenomina\\", in Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, vol. VIII (1897) Origin and meaning The most familiar etymology of this praenomen was given by Gaius Plinius Secundus, and followed by Sextus Pompeius Festus, who derived it from the verb caedere, \\"to cut,\\" and explained that it was originally given to a child who was cut from the mother's womb, in the operation that came to be known as the Caesarean section.Gaius Plinius Secundus, Naturalis HistoriaSextus Pompeius Festus, epitome by Paulus Diaconus This seems to be a reasonable etymology for the name of the operation, but it is probably an example of false etymology with respect to the name Caeso, as well as the cognomen Caesar, which appears to derive from the same root. Marquardt and Mommsen, while still deriving the name from caedere, speculated that Caeso was somehow connected with the lashings administered by the Luperci, or \\"brotherhood of the wolf,\\" a body of priests, during the festival of the Lupercalia. As the Luperci ran about the ancient city wall, dressed in animal skins and carrying leather thongs, girls and young women would gather along the route to receive lashes, which were believed to promote fertility.Karl Joachim Marquardt, Handbuch der R√∂mischen Alterth√ºmer, vol. iiiTheodor Mommsen, R√∂mische Forschungen However, the likeliest explanation derives the name from caesius, \\"blue-grey,\\" a word frequently used to describe the color of the eyes. This etymology was given by Festus with respect to the feminine form, Caesula. It was also one of four different explanations given for the cognomen Caesar, which Varro believed to have originated as a praenomen. This opinion is accepted by Chase, in his treatise, \\"The Origin of Roman Praenomina.\\"Marcus Terentius Varro, quoted in De Praenominibus (epitome by Julius Paris) Notes Ancient Roman praenomina ","title":"Caeso (praenomen)"},{"id":"25176956","text":"Tibolci () is a settlement on the left bank of the Pesnica River in the Municipality of Gori≈°nica in northeastern Slovenia.

Rice plants have been modified to increase micronutrients such as vitamin A, accelerate photosynthesis, tolerate herbicides, resist pests, increase grain size, generate nutrients, flavours or produce human proteins. The natural movement of genes across species, often called horizontal gene transfer or lateral gene transfer, can also occur with rice through gene transfer mediated by natural vectors. Transgenic events between rice and Setaria millet have been identified. The cultivation and use of genetically modified varieties of rice remains controversial and is not approved in some countries. Rice plants being used for genetic modification History In 2000, the first two GM rice varieties both with herbicide- resistance, called LLRice60 and LLRice62, were approved in the United States. Later, these and other types of herbicide-resistant GM rice were approved in Canada, Australia, Mexico and Colombia. However, none of these approvals triggered commercialization.GM Crop Database of the Center for Environmental Risk Assessment, (LLRICE06, LLRICE62). Reuters reported in 2009 that China had granted biosafety approval to GM rice with pest resistance,China gives safety approval to GMO rice, Reuters, 27 November 2009. but that strain was not commercialized. As of December 2012 GM rice was not widely available for production or consumption.The state of play: genetically modified rice, Rice Today, Jan-Mar 2012. Advocates claim that since rice is a staple crop across the world, improvements have potential to alleviate hunger, malnutrition and poverty. In 2018, Canada and the United States approved genetically modified golden rice for cultivation, with Health Canada and the US Food and Drug Administration declaring it safe for consumption. Traits  Herbicide resistance  In 2000-2001 Monsanto researched adding glyphosate tolerance to rice but did not attempt to bring a variety to market. Bayer‚Äôs line of herbicide resistant rice is known as LibertyLink. LibertyLink rice is resistant to glufosinate (the active chemical in Liberty herbicide). Bayer CropScience is attempting to get their latest variety (LL62) approved for use in the EU. The strain is approved for use in the US but is not in large-scale use. Clearfield rice was bred by selection from variations created in environments known to cause accelerated rates of mutations. This variety tolerates imidazole herbicides. It was bred by traditional breeding techniques that are not considered to be genetic engineering. Clearfield is also crossbred with higher yielding varieties to produce an overall hardier plant. Nutritional value Golden rice with higher concentrations of Vitamin A was originally created by Ingo Potrykus and his team. This genetically modified rice is capable of producing beta-carotene in the endosperm (grain) which is a precursor for vitamin A. Syngenta was involved in the early development of Golden Rice and held some intellectual property that it donated to non-profit groups including the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) to develop on a non-profit basis.Golden Rice and Intellectual Property: Public-Private Partnership and Humanitarian Use, Golden Rice Humanitarian Board website. The scientific details of the rice were first published in Science Magazine in 2000. Golden Rice grains (right) compared to regular rice grains (left) Golden Rice plants being grown in greenhouse The World Health Organization stated that iron deficiency affects 30% of the world's population. Research scientists from the Australian Centre for Plant Functional Genomics (ACPFG) and IRRI to are working to increase the amount of iron in rice.Iron biofortification, ACPFG website. They have modified three populations of rice by over expressing the genes OsNAS1, OsNAS2 or OsNAS3. The research team found that nicotianamine, iron, and zinc concentration levels increased in all three populations relative to controls. Pest resistance BT rice is modified to express the cryIA(b) gene of the Bacillus thuringiensis bacterium. The gene confers resistance to a variety of pests including the rice borer through the production of endotoxins. The Chinese Government is doing field trials on insect resistant cultivars. The benefit of BT rice is that farmers do not need to spray their crops with pesticides to control fungal, viral, or bacterial pathogens. Conventional rice is sprayed three to four times per growing season to control pests. Other benefits include increased yield and revenue from crop cultivation. China approved the rice for large-scale use as of 2009. Allergy resistance Researchers in Japan are attempting to develop hypoallergenic rice cultivars. Researchers are trying to repress the formation of allergen AS-Albumin. Japanese researchers tested genetically modified rice on macaque monkeys that would prevent allergies to cedar pollen, which causes hay fever. Cedar allergy symptoms include itchy eyes, sneezing and other serious allergic reactions. The modified rice contains seven proteins from cedar pollen (7Crp) to block these symptoms by inducing oral tolerance. Takaiwa is conducting human clinical trials with this 7Crp protein as an oral vaccine.  C4 photosynthesis  In 2015 a consortium of 12 laboratories in eight countries developed a cultivar that displayed a rudimentary form of C4 photosynthesis (C4P) to boost growth by capturing carbon dioxide and concentrated it in specialized leaf cells. C4P is the reason corn and sugarcane grow so rapidly. Engineering C4 photosynthesis into rice could increase yields per hectare by roughly 50 percent. The current cultivar still relies primarily on C3 photosynthesis. To get them to completely adopt C4P, the plants must produce specialized cells in a precise arrangement: one set of cells to capture the carbon dioxide and to surround other cells that concentrate it. Some (possibly dozens of) genes involved in producing these cells remain to be identified. Other C3P crops that could exploit such knowledge include wheat, potatoes, tomatoes, apples and soybeans.  Production of recombinant proteins  Human serum albumin (HSA) is a blood protein in human blood plasma. It is used to treat severe burns, liver cirrhosis and hemorrhagic shock. It is also used in donated blood and is in short supply around the world. In China, scientists modified brown rice as a cost-effective way to produce HSA protein. The Chinese scientists put recombinant HSA protein promoters into 25 rice plants using Agrobacterium. Out of the 25 plants, nine contained the HSA protein. The genetically modified brown rice makes the same amino acid sequence as HSA. They called this protein Oryza sativa recombinant HSA (OsrHSA). The modified rice was transparent. OsrHSA was soon sold to replace cow albumin for growing cells. Clinical trials were started in China in 2017, and in the US in 2019. The same Oryzogen company makes other recombinant human proteins from rice. Ventria Bioscience uses a proprietary system known as Express Tec for producing recombinant human proteins in rice grains. Their most notable variety produces human Lactoferrin and Lysozyme. These two proteins are produced naturally in human breast milk and are used globally in infant formula and rehydration products.  Submergence resistance  While rice grows in water, it cannot survive floods which in 2010 led to loss of 4 millions of tons of rice in India and Bangladesh alone. Addition of a single gene Sub1A was sufficient to allow rice to survive underwater for up to two weeks. The gene is in public domain.  Legal Issues  US In the summer of 2006, the USDA detected trace amounts of LibertyLink variety 601 in rice shipments ready for export. LL601 was not approved for food purposes. Bayer applied for deregulation of LL601 in late July and the USDA granted deregulation status in November 2006. The contamination led to a dramatic dip in rice futures markets with losses to farmers who grew rice for export. Approximately 30 percent of rice production and 11,000 farmers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas were affected. In June 2011 Bayer agreed to pay 750 million dollars in damages and lost harvests. Japan and Russia suspended rice imports from the U.S., while Mexico and the European Union refused to impose strict testing. The contamination occurred between 1998 and 2001. The exact cause of the contamination was not discovered. China The Chinese government does not issue commercial usage licenses for genetically modified rice. All GM rice is approved for research only. Pu, et al., stated that rice engineered to produce human blood protein (HSA) requires a lot of modified rice to be grown. This raised environmental safety concerns about gene flow. They argued that this would not be a problem because rice is a self-pollinating crop, and their test showed less than 1% of the modified gene transferred in pollination. Another study suggested that insect-mediated gene flow may be higher than previously assumed.

SuperFabric is a cut and abrasion resistant material,http://www.superfabric.com/en1/pages/SuperFabric_overview.html and a registered trademark of Higher Dimension Materials, Inc. As a technical fabric, SuperFabric is created with a base fabric such as nylon, polyester, neoprene, crepe, etc. and is overlaid with tiny, hard guard plates in a specific pattern. Spacings between the guard plates allow a degree of flexibility, breathability and are small enough to keep most sharp objects from penetrating. This guard plate technology protects the base fabric and contributes to the durability of the material. The geometry, thickness, and size of the guard plates, as well as the base fabric, vary depending on industry requirements. Customized and optional properties include flame resistance and specialized grip.  Properties  Cut resistance SuperFabric materials have tiny raised guard plates to deflect sharp objects that would otherwise tear the underlying base fabric. These guard plates are advertised to act as a protective barrier contributing to the overall longevity of the material by reducing the likelihood that a sharp object will damage the fibers.‚Ä≥Problem Solvers‚Ä≥.

It was written by Paul Levitz, pencilled by James Sherman and Joe Staton and inked by Bob McLeod. The story arc features the efforts of the Legion of Super-Heroes to halt a massive intergalactic war involving the United Planets, the Khunds, the Dominators, the Dark Circle and the sorcerer Mordru. The story arc also features the first appearance of Shvaughn Erin, a long-running supporting character in the various Legion titles. Plot United Planets Ambassador Relnic summons Mon-El, Ultra Boy, Wildfire and Dawnstar to Weber's World to protect a diplomatic conference between the U.P. and the Dominion, while many of their fellow Legionnaires battle the Resource Raiders on and above Earth. The sudden dual crisis prevents Science Police officer Shvaughn Erin from informing the team that one of its enemies has escaped imprisonment. The Legion prevails over the Raiders, only to discover that they were advance scouts preceding a Khundian invasion of Earth. While the team struggles against the massive invasion fleet, Superboy, Element Lad, Sun Boy and Colossal Boy take the fight to Khundia (the Khund homeworld), where they learn that the Khund warlord Garlak is being telepathically manipulated by an outside force ‚Äì which they trace back to Weber's World. The Legionnaires prevent a pair of assassins from killing the Dominion diplomatic delegation at Weber's World, but it is only one in a series of events seemingly designed to disrupt the peace conference. When Relnic and the Dominators suddenly vanish without a trace, the Legionnaires decide to return to Earth. Along the way, they locate a space station and discover the missing Dominators, who inform them that Relnic is a Dark Circle agent. Meanwhile, the Khundian fleet penetrates the U.P. defenses and lands on Earth, with both the regular Legion and the Legion of Substitute Heroes unable to stop them. As the Khunds approach Legion Headquarters, the only ones remaining to defend the complex are the four Legionnaires who were forced to retire upon marriage: Lightning Lad, Saturn Girl, Bouncing Boy and Duo Damsel.The Legion Constitution once forbade married Legionnaires from remaining on the active roster.Lightning Lad and Saturn Girl were married in All-New Collectors' Edition #C-55 (1978), while Bouncing Boy and Duo Damsel were wed in Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes #200 (January/February 1974). After the four of them successfully defend Legion HQ, Saturn Girl telepathically probes one of the Khundish commanders, learning that reinforcements sent by the Dark Circle are approaching the planet. Officer Erin fends off Khundian troops at Science Police HQ with the assistance of Karate Kid, who returns from the 20th century.Karate Kid's extended journey into the past is chronicled in Karate Kid #1-15 (April 1976 ‚Äì August 1978) and Kamandi #58 (September 1978). At Earth's Presidential Palace, the returning Legionnaires locate their comrades who were captured in battle with the Khunds, but are now being held by members of the Dark Circle. The Circle agents attempt to destroy Earth using a sphere of negative matter. Superboy, Mon-El, Ultra Boy, and Wildfire block most of the negasphere's energy as it is released, but the palace is demolished. Only a handful of Legionnaires are conscious when one of the Circle agents (who had been masquerading as Ambassador Relnic) reveals himself to be the escaped foe that Erin tried to warn the Legion about earlier: the sorcerer Mordru. Having skillfully manipulated the Resource Raiders, the Khunds, the Dark Circle and the events on Weber's World, Mordru seizes control of Earth. After a brief retreat, Superboy, Lightning Lad, Saturn Girl and Karate Kid rescue the imprisoned Legionnaires and Substitute Heroes. In orbit above Earth, Mordru fends off the entire group of heroes, until Element Lad is able to transmute the free-floating hydrogen atoms surrounding the sorcerer into soil. Having been effectively imprisoned underground, Mordru is defeated.Mordru loses his power upon being buried underground, as first seen in Adventure Comics #369‚Äì370 (June‚ÄìJuly 1968). In the aftermath of the crisis, the Khunds and the Dark Circle are driven out of United Planets territory. The U.P. and the Dominion sign an extended peace treaty. The Legion unanimously amends its constitution to allow married Legionnaires to remain on active duty. Lightning Lad and Saturn Girl opt to return to the team, while Bouncing Boy and Duo Damsel decline to do so.

After thirty-four years of service, she was sold to the Republic of China Navy (Taiwan), where she was still serving as of 2016. World War II Tawakoni was named after a Caddoan Indian tribe of the Wichita group that lived in Texas on the banks of the middle Brazos and Trinity Rivers during the 18th and 19th centuries. She began her naval career in the Pacific theater, joining the U.S. 5th fleet just in time for the invasion of Iwo Jima, which took place in February 1945. During this battle Tawakoni assisted the destroyer minesweeper , which had been hit by two 250-pound bombs on 18 February. She also assisted in retraction, towing and salvage operations off Iwo Jima until the latter part of March, when she returned to Ulithi for repairs to minor damage suffered during the battle. On 6 April 1945, Tawakoni was involved in the invasion of Okinawa when she was attacked by several Japanese kamikaze planes while assisting the badly damaged about fifty miles from the island. Through maneuvering and gunnery on the part of her crew, the ship managed to down five Japanese aircraft while suffering minimal damage herself. On 16 April Tawakoni participated in the invasion of Ie Shima, where she towed the damaged to safety while downing yet another kamikaze plane. On 1 July she made for Leyte in the Philippines, which is where V-J day found her. Korean War Following the Second World War Tawakoni generally operated in the Pacific area, performing towing and other services and visiting ports from the United States to Asia. In November 1950, she joined Task Force 90, Amphibious Force, Far East, operating in support of United Nations efforts in Korea. During the Korean War, she took part in three campaigns: Communist China Aggression (1950‚Äì51); First UN Counteroffensive (1951); and the Communist China Spring Offensive (1951). She planted buoys in the channels at Wonsan, Hungnam and Inchon harbors, and provided towing services to ships of the United States 7th Fleet during her Korean service. Operation Castle In March 1954, Tawakoni was one of the ships tasked to support Operation Castle, a series of high-energy (high-yield) nuclear tests by Navy Joint Task Force SEVEN (JTF-7) at Bikini Atoll. The highest level of contamination recorded aboard the ship during this operation was 0.2 mr/hr. Vietnam War During the Vietnam War, Tawakoni would see service in three campaigns: Vietnam Counteroffensive Phase VI (1968‚Äì69), Tet 69 Counteroffensive (1969), and Winter-Spring 1970. During Phase VI, she participated in the surveillance of Soviet electronic intelligence trawlers monitoring U.S. operations in the Gulf of Tonkin. She also assisted in towing, recovery and similar operations during her time in Vietnam. May 1967 she rescued . Awards Tawakoni was awarded the appropriate service medals for World War II (including the American Campaign Medal and the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal), Korea and Vietnam. She was also awarded two battle stars for her World War II service, three for her Korean War service, and four campaign stars for her Vietnam War service, together with a Combat Action Ribbon and a Navy Unit Commendation. Her crew during these periods earned the Navy Occupation Service Medal, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, and the Republic of Korea War Service Medal, among other awards. Republic of China Navy service In June 1978, Tawakoni was decommissioned and sold to Taiwan under the Security Assistance Program, where she was recommissioned in the ROC Navy as ATF Da Han (ATF-553).

He was the son of Prince Nikolaus II and succeeded his father on the latter's death in 1833. The basis of his wealth For several generations, the Esterh√°zy family had been exceedingly wealthy. The wealth came from their extensive landholdings, mostly in Hungary. In 1848 the American author John Stevens Cabot Abbott wrote the following of him: Prince Esterh√°zy in 1830 > [In Hungary,] the feudal system still exists in all its ancient barbaric > splendor. Prince Esterhazy, a Hungarian baron, is probably the richest man, > who is not seated on a throne, in the world. He lives in the highest style > of earthly grandeur. One of his four magnificent palaces contains three > hundred and sixty rooms for guests, and a theater. His estates embrace one > hundred and thirty villages, forty towns, and thirty-four castles. By the > old feudal law, still undisturbed, he possesses unlimited power over his > vassals, and can imprison, scourge, and slay at pleasure ... He has quite a > little band of troops in his pay, and moves with military pomp and gorgeous > retinue from palace to palace.Abbott 1848, p. 136 The Prince's wealth came partly from the great number of peasants who owed him a portion of the fruits of the labors. He also had his own enterprises, directed by his staff, notably sheep raising. Of his enormous flock, Abbott relates: > Not long ago he visited England, and was a guest of the Lord of Holkham, one > of the most wealthy proprietors of that island. While looking upon a very > beautiful flock of two thousand sheep, the Lord of Holkham inquired if > Esterhazy could show as fine a flock upon his estates. The wealthy baron > smilingly replied, \\" My shepherds are more numerous than your sheep.\\" This > was literally true, for Esterhazy has two thousand five hundred shepherds. Despite his great wealth, Paul managed to spend beyond his means, getting into financial trouble just as his father had. According to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition, \\"the last years of his life were spent in comparative poverty and isolation, as even the Esterh√°zy-Forchtenstein estates were unequal to the burden of supporting his fabulous extravagance and had to be placed in the hands of curators.\\" His successor Nikolaus III got out of debt in part by selling the famous family art collection. Career as diplomat and politician Minister besides the King in the Batthy√°ny Government While most of Paul's ancestors had served the Empire as military officers, Paul instead pursued a career in diplomacy, and later politics. In 1806 he was secretary of the embassy in London, and in 1807 worked with Metternich in the same capacity in Paris. In 1810 he was accredited to the court of Dresden, where he tried in vain to detach Saxony from Napoleon, and in 1814 he accompanied his father on a secret mission to Rome. He took a leading part in all the diplomatic negotiations consequent upon the wars of 1813‚Äì1815, especially at the Congress of Ch√¢tillon. After the Congress of Vienna (1815) he was appointed as ambassador to the United Kingdom at the request of the Prince Regent. His wife Maria Theresia became extremely popular in London, and was a patroness of Almack's club, the centre of fashionable society. In 1824 he represented Austria as ambassador extraordinary at the coronation of Charles X of France, and was the premier Austrian commissioner at the London conferences of 1830‚Äì1836. In 1842 Paul returned to Hungary and became a member of the Conservative Party, which supported the Habsburg supremacy and did not favour the reform experiments. On 7 April 1848 he was appointed as Minister besides the King in the first cabinet of Hungary which was controlled by Count Lajos Batthy√°ny. His role was as the mediatory between Vienna and the Hungarian government. Seeing that his pacifying intentions ended in failure, he resigned from his position in September. Later Esterh√°zy took connections with the immigrated politicians. He was Minister besides the King during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. At the time of the Napoleonic Wars he worked for the Austrian Empire as a diplomat. He tried to form diplomatic associations for Vienna, (for example with the Kingdom of Saxony), but he did not achieve any results. Despite this failure Esterh√°zy remained a famous and acknowledged politician.

To do so, it amended the California Constitution and ordinary statutes. Provisions The Victims' Bill of Rights declared its purpose as to ensure that: Amendment of the constitution The Victim's Bill of Rights added Section 28 to Article 1 of the constitution. This section has since been substantially added to and amended by Marsy's Law, enacted in 2008. Section 28 granted victims of crime the right to restitution from the perpetrator unless there were \\"compelling and extraordinary reasons\\" to the contrary. It also conferred a right to school safety; it reads \\"All students and staff of public primary, elementary, junior high and senior high schools have the inalienable right to attend campuses which are safe, secure and peaceful\\". Section 28 introduced a \\"right to truth in evidence\\". This means that state courts cannot exclude any \\"relevant evidence\\" even if gathered in a manner that violates the rights of the accused. The U.S. Constitution takes priority over the California constitution so courts may still be obliged to exclude evidence under the federal Bill of Rights. In practice the law prevented the California courts from interpreting the state constitution so as to impose an exclusionary rule more strict than that required by the federal constitution.P. 165, Constitutional Politics in the States: Contemporary Controversies and Historical Patterns, G. Alan Tarr, 1996. Exceptions may be made to the \\"truth in evidence\\" rule by a two-thirds vote of both houses of the California Legislature. Section 28 provided that public safety should be the primary consideration in determining whether to grant bail. The Victims' Bill of Rights proposed to repeal Article 1, Section 12, which contained the existing constitutional provisions on bail, but this conflicted with another proposition enacted on the same day. The other proposition received a higher number of votes and so, under the California constitution, it took precedence. Section 28 finally provided that prior felony convictions \\"shall subsequently be used without limitation for purposes of impeachment or enhancement of sentence in any criminal proceeding\\". Statutory changes The Victims' Bill of Rights made various changes to the California Penal Code and the Welfare and Institutions Code. Victims of crime were granted the right to be notified of, to attend, and to state their views at sentencing and parole hearings. Other provisions related to the defense of insanity and diminished capacity, harsher punishments for recidivists and the limitation of plea bargaining.

It is officially within the comarca of Bergued√†, but traditionally, it is a part of the natural comarca of Llu√ßan√®s. The municipality is located on the riera, or stream, of Merl√®s, from which the town takes its name. It is located about 14 kilometers east of Puig-reig, and 8 kilometers west of Prats de Llu√ßan√®s, the nearest market town. The town is divided into two parishes, Santa Maria (in the Bishopric of Solsona) to the west of the riera, and Sant Mart√≠ (in the Bishopric of Vic) to the east. Although the municipality lies within the natural region of Llu√ßan√®s, it voted in 2015 not to join a proposed new comarca of that name, but the plan was put on hold due to insufficient support. Folklore The town was traditionally dominated by two important families, the Cortadas and the Vilaltas. Their monumental houses still stand in the municipality. A popular legend offers an explanation for the reconstruction of the Church of Sta. Maria in the 17th century. An animosity developed between the two families, and in order to anger the patriarch of the Cortada household, the head of the Vilalta family sat one Sunday in the pew reserved for his rival. The patriarch of the Cortadas was so offended that he left church, only to return with a firearm. He killed the head of the Vilaltas in the church and, as a result, the building had to be torn down and rebuilt on the other side of the main road. Later, the patriarch of the Cortadas felt remorse for what he had done, and as penitence erected a chapel dedicated to Saint Mary Magdalene on his property, beside the main road.

Several of the group studied at Oxford University. The term was coined by Derek Conway in July 2004, before Cameron became leader. It was intended to be pejorative, as Conway was one of the 'bed blockers' preventing the party modernising. The term is in reference to all of them having lived in Notting Hill, in west London, although the group's two leading players, Cameron and George Osborne, no longer live in Notting Hill. The set is often seen as symbolic of the wing of the party that dominated the leadership during Cameron's time as leader of the Conservative Party. It combines traditional centre right economic views with socially liberal and environmentally friendly stances on other issues. The group refer to themselves as the \\"Smith Square set\\" and at the time of the 1992 General Election, were often referred to as the \\"Brat Pack\\".https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/nickrobinson/2008/02 Make a million by helping the poor Members The following have been reported to be its members: * David Cameron, Shadow Secretary of State for Education and Skills (2005), Leader of the Opposition (2005‚Äì2010) and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (2010‚Äì2016) * George Osborne, Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury (2004‚Äì2005), Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer (2005‚Äì2010), Chancellor of the Exchequer (2010‚Äì2016) and First Secretary of State (2015‚Äì2016) * Michael Gove, Shadow Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families (2007‚Äì2010), Secretary of State for Education (2010‚Äì2014), Chief Whip of the House of Commons (2014‚Äì2015) and Secretary of State for Justice (2015‚Äì2016) * Ed Vaizey, Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries (2010‚Äì2016) * Nick Boles, Minister of State for Skills and Equalities (2014‚Äì2016) * Steve Hilton, former Director of Strategy at Conservative Campaign Headquarters * Rachel Whetstone, Hilton's wife and head of Google's division in Europe until June 2015 * Edward Llewellyn, Downing Street Chief of Staff (2010‚Äì2016) * The Baroness Fall, Downing Street Deputy Chief of Staff (2010‚Äì2016) * The Lord Feldman of Elstree, Chair of the Conservative Party (2010‚Äì2016) Theresa May era Following the resignation of David Cameron, the remaining nine members were fully removed from power by Theresa May, following her victory in the leadership election of June 2016, and the formation of the May Ministry in July 2016.

They help members of the RAF family deal with a wide range of issues: from childcare and relationship difficulties to injury and disability, and from financial hardship and debt to illness and bereavement. Any member of the RAF family can approach the fund for help, which includes serving and former members of the RAF, their partners and dependents. History The Royal Air Force Memorial in London Piper J-3 Flitfire, auctioned for the RAFBF (visible on the tail section), on display at the North Carolina Aviation Museum Lord Trenchard founded the Royal Air Force Benevolent Fund in 1919, one year after the formation of the Royal Air Force. In their first year, welfare expenditure was ¬£919. The first welfare assistance they gave was a shilling for a night's lodging to give the recipient a chance to seek work. Other early assistance included money to provide a beneficiary with tools of his trade and the repair of a pair of working boots. In 2010 the RAFBF spent over ¬£23 million on welfare provision. The Royal Air Force Benevolent Fund was originally known as the Royal Air Force Memorial Fund as one of their charitable objects was to raise a memorial to airmen who died in the First World War. The Royal Air Force Memorial was completed in 1923. The monument, in Portland stone surmounted by a gilded eagle, can be seen on Victoria Embankment. Fundraising for the RAF Benevolent Fund occurred outside the UK as well. Prior to the United States entering World War II, Piper Aircraft Company produced 49, one for each state in the US plus another, Piper J-3 aircraft with RAF insignia and nicknamed the Flitfire, to be auctioned to benefit the RAFBF. On 29 April 1941 all 48 aircraft flew into La Guardia Field for a dedication and fundraising event which included Royal Navy officers from the battleship HMS Malaya, in New York for repairs, as honored guests. The RAFBF was awarded a Royal Charter in 1999 and this was updated in 2008 by the addition of a new charitable object to permit them to work towards supporting the morale and well-being of the serving RAF.

Diminished Value (DV) is often associated with vehicles that have been damaged, however, it is applicable to other property of value including collectibles such as jewelry, artwork, etc. For the purposes herein, reference will involve the loss in value of a damaged automobile where the term is often applied. Unlike \\"depreciation\\", which is an anticipated and predictable loss in value over time, ‚ÄòInherent Diminished Value‚Äô is a loss in value due to a specific, sudden and unexpected negative occurrence. Diminished value of an automobile following an accident may occur in one of three ways (or a combination thereof): (1) repair-related diminished value; (2) Immediate diminished value; and (3) inherent diminished value. Repair-related diminished value is the loss of value due to the inability to perfectly repair the vehicle, so it is worth less after repairs than it was before the wreck. Immediate Diminished Value ‚Äì The difference in resale value of a vehicle immediately before damage has occurred and immediately after damage has occurred (prior to repair). As courts are rarely the chosen venue for recovery of property damage, the standard of \\"Immediate Diminished Value\\" is rarely employed in resolving Property Damage claims. This also refers to a loss of value caused by the insurer's direct involvement in the claim adjustment in which the insurer exerts control over the repairs and repairs are incomplete, insufficiently performed, or otherwise restore the vehicle to less than the standard condition. Inherent Diminished Value - Assumes optimal repair quality has been achieved and is defined as the amount by which the resale value of a repaired vehicle has been reduced simply because the subject vehicle now has a significant damage history. This is the most widely recognized and accepted form of Diminished Value. It is also the basis upon which any supplemental form of Diminished Value would be added. A common \\"Supplemental\\" form of Diminished Value is \\"Repair Related Diminished Value\\". Usually, a frame or structurally damaged vehicle cannot be re-sold as a \\"certified pre-owned vehicle.\\" The true measure of a damaged vehicle's inherent loss in value can be measured as the difference in the value of the vehicle before the loss to that after the loss, prior to or after repair. The standard rule as to establishing a value on late model vehicles would be: 20-25% behind book (Black Book, KBB, NADA) and utilize actual sales results, and not on advertised prices. While some may claim Diminished Value (DV) is subjective and based upon perception or speculation, the old adage \\"perception becomes reality' applies and as such Diminution in Value is real simply because, for the most part, no reasonable and prudent person is willing to pay the same price for a vehicle with a history of damage as they would for one never having been damaged. Retailers often offer discounts for scratches and dents on appliances, electronics and dented canned goods; it is, therefore, reasonable that the value of a damaged motor vehicle will suffer a lessening in value. Additional factors may be taken into consideration in evaluating the loss in value of a damaged and repaired vehicle and may include, but not be limited to: the vehicle itself (i.e. rare collectible, originality, market desirability etc.), the vehicle's pre-loss condition, severity of the sustained damages (i.e. frame damage, flood, fire etc.), the subject vehicle's history (i.e. one owner, prior damage/repair, death of occupants etc.), quality and thoroughness of the performed repairs, (i.e. quality of parts, materials, workmanship, etc.) and additional value considerations including, but not limited to values associated with pre-owned certification programs.etc. Auto insurance companies may not readily recognize or offer to pay for diminished value. Each state may have differing opinions of DV. Example; The state of Georgia allows the insured party (the first-party Policyholder) to make a claim for their remaining economic loss for DV from their own insurance company while the neighboring state of Florida does not. Most states, however, allow the victim of another's negligence (third-party) to make a DV claim from the at-fault party. The length of time to collect Diminished Value will vary depending upon each state's statute of limitations for first party (contractual) claims and third-party (restatement of tort) claims. Diminished Value Appraisal A diminished value appraisal evaluates the difference in value of a motor vehicle after a collision repair. Reports are usually compiled by an Auto Appraisal Expert experienced in the field of DV and who may provide expert testimony for Appraisals, Arbitration, Mediation or Litigation in a court of law. This Assessment report is used when filing or disputing a diminished value claim against another party and/or an insurance company. The report measures a damaged vehicle's inherent loss in value. The diminished value can be measured as the difference in the value of the vehicle before the loss to that after the loss, prior to or after repair. In most cases even if the repair was done expertly, the value of the automobile will still be considerably less after a loss. When consumers find that a vehicle has been in an accident, most consumers will never pay the same price for a repaired vehicle as compared to one with no loss history. Some reports include an assessment of the damage done to a motor vehicle, the quality of the performed repair, the market value of the vehicle before and after the accident. There are no set rules for measuring diminished value, and since every vehicle loses value differently, a one size fits all formula would be fundamentally inaccurate. Regional Recognition of concept of diminished value varies from country to country United States Some states' statutes acknowledge diminished value and provide the ability for consumers to collect first party claims of DV from their own insurance companies under their own policies. Most states allow the consumer to collect third party claims from the at-fault driver's insurance company. Some states recognize liability for third party claims but not first party claims.http://www.mwl-law.com/wp- content/uploads/2013/03/diminution-of-value-in-all-50-states.pdf Georgia In Georgia, vehicle owners can collect DV against their own policy.  Florida  Diminished value is part of the Florida Standard Civil Jury Instructions. Diminished value case law in Florida is based primarily on two cases. * Siegle vs. Progressive Consumer's Insurance Company, 819 So.2d 732 (Florida 2002). The ability to receive diminished value financial compensation from an at-fault driver for their negligence was decided by the Florida Supreme Court in the Siegle vs. Progressive Consumer's Insurance Company case. After Siegle insurance companies are able to exclude responsibility for the payment of diminished value to the vehicle that they insure through the language in the policy. * McHale vs. Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Co. 409 So.2d 238 (1982) The Florida Third District Court of Appeal, upheld that the correct measure of damages is the cost of repair plus any reduction in the value of the vehicle. The Court also directed that proving the reduction in value is the burden of the Plaintiff bringing the claim.  Louisiana  Diminished value is provided in Louisiana Revised Statute 9:2800.17. The vehicle owner must prove by a preponderance of evidence that the fair market value would be less than its value before the vehicle was damaged. Washington On July 15, 2014, a policyholder in Washington state filed a proposed class action lawsuit in the Superior Court of Pierce County seeking diminished value insurance benefits under their automobile insurance policies. The insurance company filed a notice to remove the lawsuit to federal district court on August 20, 2014. The case is titled Johnston v. United Services Automobile Ass'n. Canada The ability to recover damages for accelerated depreciation varies from Province to Province. In British Columbia, law recognizes this loss as a recoverable damage and quantify the claim based on the diminished value at the time the collision occurs.Rule 11-2 BC Supreme Court The Rules addressing the admissibility of depreciation reports in court vary by jurisdiction. For example, in British Columbia, Canada, the BC Supreme Court requires such reports to comply with Rule 11.

The battlefield, spanning several square kilometers, was discovered in December 2008 and is currently being excavated. Roman coinage found at the site gives a probable date of the battle during the reign of one of two Roman emperors: Severus Alexander (222‚Äì235) or Maximinus Thrax (235‚Äì38). Archaeologists view the battlefield as a spectacular discovery of extraordinary scientific importance. Along with the Kalkriese battlefield and the Roman camps of and , this is one of the very few Roman archaeological sites in northern Germany. Historical context Coinage of the Roman emperors Caracalla (211 to 217) and Severus Alexander dates the battle to the 2nd quarter of the 3rd century AD. This places the battle at the junction between the reign of the Severan emperors and the beginning of the Crisis of the 3rd century. The Severan emperors The Roman Empire was governed by the Severan dynasty of emperors from 193 to 235. The reign of the Severan emperors is seen as a last phase of relative stability before the tumultuous era of the Barracks emperors and the Crisis of the 3rd century. Crisis of the 3rd century The murder of the last Severan emperor Severus Alexander and the ascension of Maximinus Thrax, a praefectus legionis of Thracian origin, to the purple, mark the epoch event of the Crisis of the 3rd century. Over the next 50 years, the Roman Empire would be ruled by some 20 to 25 claimants to the imperial throne, invaded by many foreign enemies (among them the Alamanni, the Goths, and the Vandals), and even split into three competing empires. The battle Roman arrowhead during restoration. The archaeologists responsible for the excavation believe that the about 1500 artifacts found at the battle site are associated with Roman legionaries. Only one spearhead and a few arrowheads can be certainly identified as Germanic.Meyer M. et al. The C3rd AD Romano-Germanic battlefield at Harzhorn near Krefeld, Landkreis Norheim in Roman Frontier Studies 2009 : proceedings of the 21st International Congress of Roman Frontier Studies (Limes Congress) held at Newcastle-upon-Tyne in August 2009 edited by N.Hodgson et al. Oxford: Archaeopress Publishing Ltd Since Germanic tribes of the time were also sometimes equipped with Roman weaponry, one early assumption was that this could have been an inter-Germanic battle. Other Germanic excavations of the time reveal that many such conflicts were fought during the 3rd century. The finding of many bolts associated with the Scorpio or Cheiroballistra, which were exclusively used by Roman legions, prove, according to the scientists involved, that this battle involved a larger number of Roman troops. The working hypothesis of the scientists is that the Roman troops were on their way back from the North German Plain. They found the Harzhorn pass blocked by a large number of Germans, and had to fight their way through, using their superior Roman artillery. The finds indicate a Roman success, due to their superior military technology. The battlefield today  Discovery Head archaeologists Michael Geschwinde and Petra L√∂nne leading a group of interested people through the battlefield. In 2000, hobby \\"archaeologists\\" illegally using metal detectors discovered several artifacts at the Harzhorn while searching for a medieval fortress. When one of the artifacts they unearthed turned out to be a Roman hippo sandal, they notified the Northeim county archaeologist, who is responsible for this area.Die R√∂merschlacht am Harzhorn on ndr.de 2012-1-6 (retrieved 2013-6-22) Location Location of the battlefield. The battlefield lies on the eastern edge of a hill range running east-to-west from the Harz mountains. In the north-south direction, it can only be crossed on a narrow pass, which is part of an ancient trade route, and today occupied by the Bundesautobahn 7. The artifacts are not from the pass itself, but from the Harzhorn hill, which lies directly west of it. The cliffs immediately north of here are very steep and almost impassible, making it an ideal ambush point. Dating Excavations at the Harzhorn. There is no explicit date for the battle. A coin minted under and showing the portrait of Emperor Commodus and some specific pieces of military equipment originally dated the battle to after 180 AD. A hypothesis suggested the early 3rd century, such as the supposed Germanic campaigns of Emperors Caracalla and Maximinus Thrax. Both of these are attested in historical sources, but no archaeological proof had been found so far. Later coinage finds depicting Emperors Elagabal (218-222) and Severus Alexander (222-235) further suggests Maximinus Thrax's campaigns. The Historia Augusta, a late Roman collection of biographies of the Roman Emperors, mentions that Maximinus Thrax marched north from Moguntiacum (today's Mainz) about 300 (trecenta) to 400 (quadringenta) Roman miles. Since this was thought to be impossible, this passage was often changed to triginta and quadraginta (30 to 40 miles).Regarding this passage, also see K.-P. Johne, Die R√∂mer an der Elbe, Berlin 2006, S. 262f. Numismatist Frank Berger dates the battle to between 230 and 235.Andreas Austilat: Die R√∂merschlacht an der Autobahn. Der Tagesspiegel, 2010-8-26 Germanic tribes had crossed the Rhine and devastated the Roman countryside in 233; in 235, Maximinus Thrax led a campaign of revenge into Germania, which had been prepared by his predecessor, Severus Alexander.Forschungsprojekt Harzhorn - Interpretation und historische Deutung. Website of the Forschungsprojekt Harzhorn, 2010 (retrieved 2013-6-22) Conclusions  Sources Roman sources tell of larger campaigns east of the Rhine and north of the Danube during the 3rd century, especially for the reigns of emperors Caracalla (in the year 213) and Maximinus Thrax (in the year 235). While this has been known to historians for a long time, there was never any archaeological proof of any campaign during this time within the Germania Magna. The sources are unclear on the extent of such military operations. It was assumed that they took place near the limes. The few sources that suggested otherwise were assumed to be unreliable. The Battle at the Harzhorn, as interpreted by the artifacts found to date, now proves that the Romans went far deeper into Germania during the 3rd century than was thought possible earlier. Historical consequences The events on the Harzhorn took place some 200 years after the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest and the campaigns of Germanicus (until 16 AD). These campaigns mark the end of Rome trying to conquer the lands between Rhine and Elbe and make them part of the Roman empire. In the following years, the Romans expanded their border fortifications to include parts of Germania, and shorten their lines of defense. This integrated the Agri decumates into the empire. However, campaigns deep into northern Germania were not known after this. The Battle at the Harzhorn is archaeological proof that they did nonetheless exist.

The man is wearing a blue shirt with white details. Malm√∂ Fotbollf√∂rening, also known simply as Malm√∂ FF, is a Swedish professional association football club based in Malm√∂. The club is affiliated with Sk√•nes Fotbollf√∂rbund, and plays home games at Stadion. The club's first team play in Allsvenskan as of 2018, the top league in Swedish football, which takes place from April to October every seasons. Malm√∂ FF won Allsvenskan for the first time in 1944, and most recently repeated this in 2017. Malm√∂ FF were at their strongest during the 1970s, when they won five Swedish championships and four Svenska Cupen titles, and performed well in continental competitions: the team were runners-up in both the 1978‚Äì79 European Cup and the 1979 Intercontinental Cup. Since the club was founded, there have been 32 managers and one caretaker. The honours won by the club under each manager's stewardship are also detailed.Smitt, 2009, p. 312. As of the start of the 2020 season, 31 men have held the post of Malm√∂ FF manager, the most successful of whom in terms of trophies won is Bob Houghton, who, as manager between 1974 and 1980, led the club to three Swedish league championships and four Svenska Cupen wins. The manager who has won most national league titles with the club is Antonio Dur√°n, who won Allsvenskan four times between 1964 and 1971. Although Roy Hodgson led Malm√∂ FF to the Allsvenskan crown five times in a row between 1985 and 1989, the national championship was decided by a championship play-off during this time, and Malm√∂ FF only won this in 1986 and 1988. Houghton is the club's longest-serving manager, having occupied the position between 1990 and 1992 in addition to the aforementioned period, giving him a total of 10 years in charge. The current manager of Malm√∂ FF is Jon Dahl Tomasson, who has been at the club since 10 January 2020. Managerial history Early managers (before 1936) Not much is known about the management of Malm√∂ FF during its early days following its establishment in 1910. Its first team had no official manager until 1917, when Ernst Hjertberg coached the team for a year. The post was then vacant until 1932, except for the 1922 season, when Hans Ruff was manager. Following Malm√∂ FF's first season in Allsvenskan, 1931‚Äì32, it employed Carl Wijk as manager. Wijk remained in charge until 1934, when the club was disqualified after 13 matches for breaching Swedish football's ban on professional players. The team was barred from playing for the rest of the season, and demoted a division. Wijk was temporarily banned, along with several other members of the club's non-playing staff.Smitt, 2009, pp. 26‚Äì27. First foreign managers, and first honours (1936‚Äì71) With Malm√∂ FF back in Allsvenskan from the start of the 1936‚Äì37 season, the club once more employed a manager: V√°clav Simon from Czechoslovakia became the club's first foreign-born manager. After Simon coached the team for a year, he was replaced by Harry Lundahl, who remained until 1941. Carl Ahlberg coached the team from 1942 to 1944. Following his initial tenure between April and November 1944, Sven Nilsson managed the club for two more periods during that decade. During this time he became the club's first Allsvenskan title winning manager, when the team won the league championship at the end of the 1943‚Äì44 season. Two Hungarian managers, Istv√°n Wampetits and K√°lm√°n Konr√°d, managed Malm√∂ FF between Nilsson's periods in charge. Konr√°d secured the club's second league title during the 1948‚Äì49 season. The team won its third league title in 1950, with Nilsson in charge. Malm√∂ FF continued to be successful during the 1950s: Welshman Bert Turner managed Malm√∂ FF between 1951 and 1954, and led the club to two league championships and two cup titles during this time. He was replaced in 1955 by another foreign-born manager, Austrian Pepi Stroh. Neither Stroh or his successor, former Malm√∂ FF player Nils-√Öke Sandell, won any honours. This dry spell ended following the appointment in 1964 of Spaniard Antonio Dur√°n, who coached the club until 1971. During this time Malm√∂ FF won Allsvenskan four times, lifted the cup in 1967, and entered European competitions with limited success. Englishmen Bob Houghton and Roy Hodgson manage the club to unprecedented success (1971‚Äì89) alt=A black and white photograph of a middle-aged man of British appearance. The man is clean shaven and sports curly hair. He is wearing formal attire, a striped shirt with a black tie is visible under a grey suit jacket. He is looking past the viewers left. Karl- Erik Hult managed the club to a cup title in 1973, before Bob Houghton replaced him in 1974. Malm√∂ FF chairman Eric Persson was reportedly initially hesitant to employ Houghton, who at 27 was younger than several of the club's players, but was convinced when the Englishman met them and won their respect and confidence. Houghton had never met any of the players, but had researched them thoroughly; he impressed the team by immediately recognising each of them and knowing them by first name.Smitt, 2009, p. 64‚Äì65. Duly installed as coach, Houghton led Malm√∂ FF to three league titles and four cup wins over the course of seven seasons, as well as the 1979 European Cup Final (which was lost to Nottingham Forest) and the 1979 Intercontinental Cup (in which Olimpia of Paraguay defeated Malm√∂ FF 3‚Äì1 over two legs). Houghton left the club in 1980, but is held in high regard at the club to the present day; a corner section of the club's present stadium, Stadion, is named \\"Bob's Corner\\" after him. Fellow Englishman Keith Blunt replaced Houghton, and remained for three seasons before Tord Grip took over. Grip managed Malm√∂ FF to a cup title in 1984 before leaving the same year. Another Englishman, Roy Hodgson, managed the club between 1985 and 1990. Under his leadership, the club won five consecutive Allsvenskan titles, and also won the then-extant league championship play-offs on two occasions, in 1986 and 1988. The side also won cup titles in 1986 and 1989. Hodgson's tenure as Malm√∂ FF manager is the most successful in terms of win percentage and Allsvenskan titles won. Like Houghton, Hodgson also has a section at Stadion: \\"Roy's Corner\\". \\"Bob's Corner\\" and \\"Roy's Corner\\" flank the stadium's standing section on each side. Recent managers (since 1989) alt=A middle-aged man of Nordic appearance photographed at a sporting press conference. His greying blond hair is brushed back, stubble is clearly visible on his face, and his dark blue eyes look up and to the viewer's right. Hodgson's departure from the club in 1989 marked the start of a 15-year period during which Malm√∂ FF failed to win a league or cup title. Houghton initially returned in Hodgson's place, but the former manager's two-year sojourn back at the club proved largely unsuccessful. He was replaced by Dane Viggo Jensen in July 1992. Jensen returned to Denmark at the end of the 1993 season, and was succeeded by Rolf Zetterlund, who managed the club between 1994 and 1996. Zetterlund's time at the club was fairly successful as the club finished each of his years in charge in the top four league places. Dutchman Frans Thijssen took Zetterlund's place in January 1997, and stayed at the club until August 1998 when he was sacked following poor results in Allsvenskan and European competition. Roland Andersson then managed the club until it was relegated at the end of the 1999 season.Smitt, 2009, p. 304. As the club had never before been relegated (having only previously been removed from the top division by a punitive demotion), Andersson was sacked. He was replaced by Michael Andersson (no relation), who guided the team to promotion back to Allsvenskan at the first attempt. Tom Prahl, who had guided Halmstads BK to the league title in 1997 and 2000, took Andersson's place before the start of the 2002 season, and during his first year in charge led Malm√∂ FF to second place in Allsvenskan, the club's best league finish since 1996. After finishing third in 2003, expectations were high during early 2004, when the club signed several well-known players, including FC Barcelona defender Patrik Andersson, a former Malm√∂ FF player. The Swedish press compared this spending spree to those of Real Madrid, and labelled Malm√∂ FF's new collection of players \\"Real Malm√∂\\". Malm√∂ FF lived up to these expectations during the 2004 season by winning the club's first league title since 1989. After Prahl's contract ran out at the end of 2005, he was replaced by S√∂ren √Ökeby. Having won consecutive league titles with Djurg√•rdens IF in 2002 and 2003, √Ökeby was widely respected on his appointment, but he proved unable to continue where Prahl left off. He was let go by the club after two seasons, and replaced by Roland Nilsson. After two seasons with the team, Nilsson guided the club to their 19th Allsvenskan title in 2010, the year of the team's centenary. Nilsson left to manage F.C. Copenhagen in June 2011. Former AIK manager Rikard Norling was appointed on 3 June 2011. After being one goal away from qualifying for the group stage of the 2011‚Äì12 UEFA Champions League he guided the club to a fourth position in 2011. The 2012 season almost resulted in a new league title as Malm√∂ FF fought for the title until the last round, in the end the club ended in third place. Norling won the club's 17th Swedish Championship and 20th Allsvenskan title in the 2013 season. Norling announced his resignation on 27 November and cited undisclosed reasons for his decision. On 9 January 2014 the club announced the appointment of Norwegian √Öge Hareide as the club's new manager. Hareide was the first non-Swedish manager for the club since Dutchman Frans Thijssen who left Malm√∂ FF in 1998. Hareide had immediate success at the club as he led the team to defend their Allsvenskan title and qualify for the group stage of the 2014‚Äì15 UEFA Champions League in his first season. After a second spell in Champions League in 2015, Hareide left the club to coach Denmark national football team and he was replaced by Allan Kuhn Managers alt=A photograph of a grey-haired, middle-aged man at a press conference.

Between and including the 1982 and 1990 seasons, the Swedish football championship was decided not by the final standings in Allsvenskan, but by a play-off held following the Allsvenskan season, which pitted the four best-placed clubs against each other in a two- legged cup format. The Malm√∂ FF team won Allsvenskan five times in a row between 1985 and 1989, but had to contest these play-offs each time to claim the national title. Though they won the play-offs in 1986 and 1988, they failed to do so in 1985, 1987 and 1989, and therefore were not Swedish champions those years.

Although never especially common, Decimus was used throughout Roman history from the earliest times to the end of the Western Empire and beyond, surviving into modern times. The feminine form is Decima. The name also gave rise to the patronymic gens Decimia.Mika Kajava, Roman Female Praenomina: Studies in the Nomenclature of Roman Women (1994) Decimus was especially favored by the plebeian gens Junia, which may originally have been patrician. However, the name does not seem to have been used regularly by any other patrician family. It was widespread amongst the plebeians, and resisted the general trend of uncommon praenomina to become less frequent over time, instead becoming more popular towards the end of the Roman Republic and into Imperial times.Dictionary of Greek & Roman Biography & Mythology Origin and meaning of the name Decimus is the Latin word for tenth, and it falls into a class of similar praenomina including the masculine names Quintus, Sextus, Septimus, Octavius, and Nonus, as well as the feminine names Prima, Secunda, Tertia, Quarta, Quinta, Sexta, Septima, Octavia, and Nona. It is generally believed that the name was originally given to a tenth child, a tenth son, or a tenth daughter. However, it has also been argued that Decimus and the other praenomina of this type could refer to the month of the year in which a child was born. It may be that such names could be given for either reason.George Davis Chase, \\"The Origin of Roman Praenomina\\", in Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, vol. VIII (1897)Oxford Classical Dictionary, 3rd Ed. (1996) Whatever the original reason for the name, it is clear from the historical record that parents frequently chose these praenomina because they were family names, and not because of their meaning. Chase cites the example of a grandfather, father, and son in gens Junia, each of whom bore the name Decimus, and achieved the consulship, as well as a later case in which the grandfather and father were both consuls. It was inconceivable that each of these was a tenth son, or even a tenth child. A similar case could be made for the many generations of certain families, such as the Fabii, who made extensive use of the praenomen Quintus, or the Julii with respect to the praenomen Sextus. The Oscan praenomen Decius or Deciis is derived from the same root, and gave rise to the patronymic gens Decia.Realencyclop√§die der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft Notes Ancient Roman praenomina ","title":"Decimus (praenomen)"},{"id":"25177435","text":"Buir Lake (; ) is a freshwater lake that straddles the border between Mongolia and China.

More traditional Tlingit gravitated toward the Orthodox Church among Christian offerings, as it had used local languages in worship since about 1800 in Kodiak and 1824 in the Aleutian Islands. The Holy Scriptures and much of the Divine Liturgy (as the Orthodox call the Mass, or Lord's Supper) had been translated into Tlingit by St. Innocent (Veniaminov) during his years as a priest in Sitka (1834‚Äì40) and later as Bishop of Alaska (1842‚Äì1850). Anathahash returned from Sitka in 1890 with the Rev. Vladimir Donskoy, the first Russian Orthodox priest to conduct services in the area. During Fr. Vladimir's stay, he instructed and baptized many of the local Tlingit people. That year Alexei Yaakwaan, son of a Tlingit leader, converted to the Orthodox Church and encouraged his father, Yees Gaanaalx, leader of the L'eeneid√≠ (Dog Salmon) people of Auke Bay, to be baptized. Sitka Chief Khlantych told the church that Yees Gaanaalx wanted to convert to Orthodoxy and that Tlingit would follow his example. On July 26, 1892 Bishop Nicholas (Ziorov) of the Aleutian Islands and Alaska (1891‚Äì1898), visited Juneau from San Francisco, where the seat of the church in America had been located since 1872. The bishop was met by the Tlingit leaders wanting to convert. According to oral tradition, he was told that the Tlingit leaders had each been having a common, recurring dream. In their dream, a short, white-bearded, elderly man encouraged them to become Christian. When these leaders saw an icon of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, Archbishop of Myra in Lycia, they \\"recognized\\" him as being the man in their dreams. Three days later, the Priest-monk Mitrofan baptized both Yees Gaanaalx and his wife, giving them the Christian names of Dimitri and Elizabeth. Following their example, some 700 of approximately 1500 Tlingit in the area also converted to the Orthodox church. Iconostas at St. Nicholas, June 2010 With such a large Native congregation to be served, the Orthodox Missionary Society in Russia sent architectural drawings, interior church furnishings ‚Äì such as candlestands, a chalice set, censers, banners, a full iconostasis (the icon screen), and festal icons ‚Äì and two hundred silver rubles to support construction of a church for them. The six large panels on the iconostasis are the original icons received from Russia and hold a unique position as the only known iconostasis where the deacon's doors depict Sts. Cyril and Methodius rather than either the Archangels Michael and Gabriel or the Deacons Stephen & Lawrence. The newly baptized Tlingit and Serbian gold miners, who were already Orthodox, helped build the traditional structure. It is a high-quality example of the \\"Russian Colonial\\" style of architecture. In June 1894, Bishop Nicholas returned to Juneau and consecrated the new church in honor of St. Nicholas. On June 5, 2016 Bishop David (Mahaffey) at Saint Nicholas Church with Alaska Governor Bill Walker and First Lady Donna Walker opened of a new monument erected in memory of the many Aleuts who lost their lives in internment camps during World War II.https://oca.org/news/headline- news/two-days-and-two-historic-celebrations-in-juneau-alaska See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Juneau, Alaska References External links Alaska Native culture in Juneau Buildings and structures in Juneau, Alaska Churches completed in 1893 Historic American Buildings Survey in Alaska Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Alaska Russian Orthodox church buildings in Alaska Tourist attractions in Juneau, Alaska Buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Juneau, Alaska Tlingit culture ","title":"St. Nicholas Russian Orthodox Church (Juneau, Alaska)"},{"id":"25177439","text":"Mathieu Guy (born January 3, 1983 in Toulouse) is a French professional football player, who currently plays for Toulouse-Fontaines.Mathieu Guy joueur de TOULOUSE FONTAINES Toulouse Fontaines Club - Foot National Career He played on the professional level in Ligue 2 for Amiens SC and in the Championnat de France amateur for SR Colmar.

History Constantin Hansen: Scene from the interior of Ringsted Church: In the foreground Constantin Hansen and J√∏rgen Roed, 1829, During comprehensive restoration work at the beginning of the 20th century, the foundations of the former travertine church (1080) were revealed, indicating that the older nave was approximately the same length as today's. The church was originally dedicated to St. Mary. In 1157, Saint Canute Lavard's bones were moved into a new chapel in the church with the approval of St. Canute's son, Valdemar the Great. Many miracles were said to have occurred there and the church immediately became a popular site for pilgrimages. With the funds raised from the pilgrims and thanks to Valdemar's royal patronage, the abbey church was expanded and, in 1170, was dedicated with great ceremony to Benedict of Nursia.The Gentleman's magazine, Bind 206.

There were, however, some later modifications in the Gothic style such as the vaults, replacing the original flat ceiling, and the pointed arches in the tower. For centuries, the church served as the monastery church; it was only after the Reformation that in 1571 it became a normal parish church.Hvem er Sct. Bendt? From Sct Bendts Kirke. In Danish. Retrieved 24 November 2009. A fire in 1806 destroyed the monastery and damaged the church. As a result, the western wall was pulled down and replaced with an Empire style facade. The brickwork of the church's outer walls was covered with cement and limewashed. Large-scale restoration work was carried out between 1899 and 1910 by the Danish architect H.B. Storck who set out to restore the church to its former Romanesque style. It was the first time such extensive restoration work had been carried out in Denmark. The church took on its old appearance with new Romanesque windows in the nave. A pyramid-shaped spire was added to the tower. The cement was removed from the outer walls revealing the church's original red brickwork. Royal burial site Plaque listing royal tombs Gravestone of the exiled King and Queen of Sweden As the church houses the tomb of Valdemar the Great, it is of great historical significance to Denmark.

Jacob Kornerup uncovered murals in the chancel in 1868. In 1889, he restored them, or possibly repainted them, as they are indeed in very poor condition. Others were uncovered during the 1900‚Äì09 repairs and restored by Mads Henriksen. They depict various monarchs, some with Latin inscriptions. There are also images of the Virgin Mary and of Christ. Of particular note are the frescos of Erik IV, also known as Erik Ploughpenny for the unpopular taxes he imposed on ploughs. They were painted around 1300 in an unsuccessful attempt to have the assassinated king canonized. To the left of a painting of Queen Agnes sitting on her throne is a picture of the king's murderers stabbing him with a spear while, on the right, we see fishermen retrieving the corpse from the sea.Google Books extract from Copenhagen by Sally O'Brien.

A decorated World War I officer and supporter of Nazism, Heitz advanced rapidly under the Third Reich. In 1936, he became the president of the Reich Military Court. At the advanced age of 60, Heitz took command of the VIII Army Corps and participated in the Invasion of Poland, the Battle of France and Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union. Heitz continued to command the VIII Army Corps as part of the 6th Army in the Battle of Stalingrad. The 6th Army was encircled within the city after Operation Uranus, the Soviet counter-offensive in Stalingrad, and eventually destroyed. Heitz surrendered the central pocket of German forces in Stalingrad on 31 January 1943 and died as a prisoner of war in the Soviet Union. World War I Born in Berlin on December 8, 1878, Heitz joined the Prussian army on August 18, 1899. Commissioned as a second lieutenant, he became battalion adjutant in 1909 and was promoted to captain in 1913. At the outbreak of World War I, he was regimental adjutant of the 36th (2nd West Prussian) Field Artillery Regiment ‚ÄúHochmeister‚Äù. He remained with his regiment during World War I, where he became a battery commander and battalion commander, and fought in East Prussia (1914), on the Russian Front (1914‚Äì1915), and on the Western Front from the fall of 1915 until the end of the war. During the war, he awarded the Wehrmatcht long service award House Order of Hohenzollern with swords. Interwar Period Heitz in 1936 as the President of the Reichskriegsgericht (Reich Military Court) Selected for the reduced Reichswehr, he served on the staff of the Artillery School at Jueterbog (1919‚Äì1922) and in the Artillery Inspectorate in the Defense Ministry (1922‚Äì1927). He then commanded the 4th (Saxon) Artillery Regiment at Dresden (1927‚Äì1929), the Troop Maneuver Area at Jueterbog (1929‚Äì1930), and the Artillery School itself (1930‚Äì1931). Heitz eventually became the commander of Fortress Koenigsberg in late 1931 and achieved the rank of Colonel. Described by historian Samuel W. Mitcham as a \\"harsh, right-wing career officer\\", Heitz was a staunch supporter of Nazism and Hitler. This played a partial role in his appointment as the President of the Reichskriegsgericht (Reich Military Court) on 1 August 1936, Nazi Germany's highest military court. On 1 April 1937 Heitz was promoted to General of the Artillery (General der Artillerie). On 17 August 1938, during Heitz's appointment as president of the Reichskriegsgericht, Wehrkraftzersetzung (undermining military force) was established as a sedition offence in German military law, which criminalized all criticism, dissent and behavior opposed to Nazi political and military leadership, particularly within the Wehrmacht's military justice. The Wehrkraftzersetzung consolidated and redefined paragraphs already in the military penal code to punish \\"seditious\\" acts such as conscientious objection, defeatist statements, self-mutilation, and questioning the Endsieg. Convictions were punishable by the death penalty, heavy sentences in military prisons, concentration camps, and forced mobilization in combat or penal units. In 1939, a second decree was issued extending the law to civilians. World War II Arras with Heitz, a fellow veteran, May 1940 At the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Heitz was already 60 years old and would have gone into retirement. Nevertheless, he requested to be sent into the frontlines. On September 14, 1939, during the invasion of Poland Heitz was appointed as the commander of the armed forces in Danzig-West Prussia, partially because of his hatred for the Poles. On September 10, 1939, he wrote enthusiastically that he would ‚Äúrule the area with a mailed fist‚Äù and that the combat troops under his command were \\"over inclined towards a false sense of chivalry.\\" However, his command in Danzig-West Prussia only lasted four weeks. On October 25, 1939, Heitz was appointed as the commanding general of the VIII Army Corps despite his advanced age. He led the Corps in the Invasion of France and on 4 September 1940 he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for personally scouting for river crossings and leading his troops across the Oise river under enemy fire. Heitz reviews a formation of Hungarian and German soldiers in the Soviet Union, 1942 Heitz continued to command the VIII Army Corps during the German invasion of the Soviet Union Operation Barbarossa. The Corps was sent into central Russia, and took part in the Battle of Bia≈Çystok‚ÄìMinsk and the First Battle of Smolensk. After an interlude in the fall of 1941 when the VIII Corps was sent into Paris for occupation duty, the Corps was sent back to the Eastern Front. In the summer of 1942, the Corps was sent towards Southern Russia to participate in the main German strategic summer offensive of the year, Case Blue. In the offensive, Army Group B which included Heitz's Corps was to attack towards the Volga river and Stalingrad. Stalingrad and death In August of 1942, the VIII Army Corps was sent along with the rest of the 6th Army, commanded by General der Panzertruppe Friedrich Paulus into Stalingrad. The Germans managed to capture 90% of the ruined city, splitting the remaining Soviet forces in the city into two narrow pockets. On 19 November the Soviet forces launched Operation Uranus, a massive counteroffensive that involved over 1 million Soviet military personnel, aimed against Hungarian and Romanian units defending the 6th Army's flanks. The outnumbered and under-equipped Romanian 3rd Army at the northern flank and Romanian 4th Army Corps at the southern flank were overrun and by 23 November, the VIII Army Corps along with the rest of the German 6th Army was encircled and threatened with destruction. As the situation worsened for the Germans in Stalingrad, he ordered defeatists and every man who attempted surrender to be shot and coined the slogan: \\"We fight to the last bullet but one!\\" Meanwhile, other generals such as General der Artillerie Walther von Seydlitz-Kurzbach, had already given their regimental and battalion commanders permission to act and surrender independently according to local conditions. When Seydlitz released his divisional commanders on 25 January to decide for themselves whether or not to surrender, Paulus relieved him of his command and placed all of Seydlitz's divisions under Heitz. A few days later when Seydlitz and over a dozen other officers fled the German lines to surrender, bursts of machine-gun fire were aimed at them from German lines, Seydlitz later claimed that 2 German officers were mortally wounded because of Heitz's 'apocalyptic order'. On 29 January 1943, Heitz ordered that \\"Whoever surrenders, will be shot! Whoever displays the white flag, will be shot! Whoever does not immediately deliver bread or sausages dropped by our pilots, will be shot!\\" As late as the 31 of January, German soldiers who attempted surrender were shot in the back on the basis of Heitz's orders. On 26 January 1943, the German forces inside Stalingrad were split into two pockets north and south of Mamayev Kurgan. The northern pocket consisted of the XI Corps, and the VIII Corps, under Heitz. On 28 January, the two pockets were split into three. The northern pocket consisted of the XI Corps, the central with the VIII and LI Corps, and the southern with the XIV Panzer Corps and IV Corps \\"without units\\". The sick and wounded reached 40,000 to 50,000. On 29 January, Heitz had stated that he would seek the death of a soldier while defending his command post. He later attempted suicide but was stopped by his chief of staff. On 31 January 1943, Heitz surrendered the central pocket of German forces. Paulus meets with Heitz and other German generals captured in Stalingrad, February 4, 1943 At the time of his arrest, Heitz was the second- highest ranking German officer taken prisoner by the Allies, behind Paulus. In prison, he vehemently refused to cooperate with the pro-communist National Committee for a Free Germany that operated out of the Soviet Union, despite being pressured by the Soviets, who beat him and threatened his family. He died on 9 February 1944 while in Soviet captivity.

Some of his works which are critical of the Syrian government under Baathist rule have been banned by the Syrian government. Biography He attended the University of Aleppo, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in law. He wrote poetry and was a member of the Literary Forum there. As a screenwriter, Khalifa has written several television dramas including Rainbow (Kaws Kozah) and Memoirs of Al-Jalali (Serat Al-Jalali), documentaries, short films, and the feature-length film The Shrine Door (Bab al-Maqam). His first novel, Haris al-Khadi'a (\\"The Guard of Deception\\"), was published in 1993. His second novel, Dafatir al-Qurbat (\\"The Gypsy Notebooks\\"), was suppressed by the Union of Arab Writers for four years after its publication in 2000. Khalifa spent thirteen years working on In Praise of Hatred (Madih al-karahiya), his third novel, which is about how the lives of one family are affected by the battle between the Syrian government and the Muslim Brotherhood. It was published in Damascus in 2006, until it was banned by the Syrian government, when it was republished in Beirut. Khalifa says these sort of book bans come from a bureaucracy which does not represent the higher levels of government, and he favors negotiation between artists and Syrian authorities to facilitate freedom of speech. His work is not intended to advocate any political ideology. Discussing In Praise of Hatred, he said \\"above all, I wrote this novel in defense of the Syrian people and in order to protest against the suffering they have endured as a result of the religious and political dogmas that have tried to negate their ten-thousand-year civilisation.\\" In Praise of Hatred was a finalist for the International Prize for Arabic Fiction (2008).

Topography Prior to June 2, 2001, it was officially known as Saint-Charles-de-Mandeville. The town itself is located along the Mastigouche River, just north of Lake Maskinong√©. The municipal territory is dotted with lakes, many of which are lined with cottages. The northern portion is undeveloped and part of the Mastigouche Wildlife Reserve. Mandeville is considered a paradise for hunting and trapping (bear, moose, wolf, lynx) and fishing (musky, trout, bass). Mandeville is home to the Pl√©√Øades Observatory, managed by Centre d'Observation et de Recherche Astronomique Mandeville (C.O.R.A.M. Inc.). History In the early 19th century, the territory was part of the Hope Fief. This fief, with an area of 20,000 arpents (68.4 km¬≤) was granted to Ang√©lique Blondeau by Seignoral Lord Charles-Louis Tarieu de Lanaudi√®re, but was mostly neglected by the seignoral lords. In 1824, one of the first settlers, Maximillien or Maxime Mandeville, arrived at the shores of the lake that today bears his name. And in 1837, further colonization occurred when a large group of settlers came from Maskinong√©, Berthierville, and Sorel. In 1894, the Mission of Saint-Charles- de-Mandeville was formed and became a parish in 1903. The name is most likely a reference to Charles Turgeon, pastor of the nearby parish of Saint-Didace, who worked extensively in Mandeville. In 1904, the Municipality of Saint- Charles-de-Mandeville was established and in 1905, its post office opened. Since the toponym \\"Saint-Charles\\" had not been in common use for a long time, the municipality officially abbreviated its name to Mandeville in 2001. Soon after, the municipal boundary between Mandeville and Saint-Damien was reorganized, and Mandeville gained about .

It stars Steven Seagal as a man released from prison after spending six years locked up for a crime he did not commit. Plot 1\\\\. In Arizona, ex-Special Forces soldier Shane Daniels (Steven Seagal) saves his wife, Holly (Aidan Dee), from a car jacking and chases the mugger (Clay Virtue) away. The mugger later ends up dead, and Shane is the sole suspect. After being locked up for six years, Shane is released from jail due to new DNA evidence, which clears his name. Shane is released with an apology from the State of Arizona and a $300,000 settlement, but feels that it does not make up for his wasted life and the loss of his wife, who has left him, which leaves him bitter. 2\\\\. Off the coast of Seattle, Washington, a ship full of smuggled Chinese people is arriving. After it arrives, an old Chinese man is taken to a safehouse. Back in Arizona, within hours of being released to the streets, Shane stops at a liquor store and buys a bottle of bourbon. Back outside, two men attempt to rob Shane, but he beats up his two attackers and steals their car. Leaving the city, Shane takes to the road and stops at a rest stop along a lonely stretch of highway. There, he witnesses a state trooper pulling over a car containing two Chinese nationals. The Chinese nationals kill the state trooper and try to kill a couple of witnesses, a young man named Sergey (Jesse Hutch) and his friend Markov (Robin Nielsen). Shane is forced to intervene, kills one of the attackers and sends the other one, Mao (Byron Lawson), running off into the desert, but Markov is killed by one of the Chinese men. When Shane checks on the dead cop, he hears noise coming from the trunk of the Chinese national‚Äôs car. Inside, he finds an unconscious woman and a duffel bag full of cash. Fearing that the cops will implicate him in the death of the trooper and knowing that the Chinese national will return with back-up, Shane takes the girl, the cash, and Sergey into the nearest small town, which is called Bellingham. Sergey admits that his father, Vlad (Vitaly Kravchenko), sells stolen cars. 3\\\\. When the woman, Tia (Marlaina Mah), regains consciousness, she begs Shane and Sergey not to turn her over to the cops or the Chinese. Tia tells Shane and Sergey that the cops in Bellingham killed her friends when she was kidnapped. The next morning, Shane has Sergey drop him and Tia off at a motel. Shane moves to a different hotel, for safety. In the second motel room, Tia explains to Shane that she was trying to get her uncle Kuan (Vincent Cheng) into the USA. She was contacted by someone who said they could help. She was told to show up alone at an abandoned mill in a remote place about 50 miles away from Bellingham, but she insisted on bringing some of her friends since it was the first time she and her contact were meeting. The man she met is a Chinese drug smuggler named Chen (Terry Chen) who told her he would help smuggle Kuan into the USA. However, Chen had her friends shot by Bellingham cops, and she was then forced into a room where another man was waiting. The man, known as the Colonel (Byron Mann), said he was waiting for Kuan's arrival, and that Tia was going to be held for ransom until the man got the information he needed from Kuan. 4\\\\. Sgt. Ritchie (Jerry Wasserman) and his henchman Clark (Mike Dopud), the two Bellingham cops who are working for Chen, go to Little Russia, Vlad's restaurant, and ask Vlad if he knows where Shane is, but Vlad turns them away, even threatening to cut Ritchie's testicles off. Meanwhile, two Chinese men break into the motel room where Shane and Tia are staying, but Shane kills them, and he and Tia escape. Outside Little Russia, Tia tells Shane that Kuan will be arriving before the day is out, and she's worried about what will happen to him. Inside, the bartender is not willing to tell Shane where Vlad and Sergey are, so Shane is forced to beat him up, and demand that he take him to Vlad. They arrive at Vlad's house, he is grateful that Shane saved Sergey's life and agrees to help Shane and Tia. Ritchie, Clark, and some Chinese men arrive at Vlad's house and a firefight takes place. After finishing off the last of Chen's men, Shane, Tia, Sergey, and Vlad leave to try to rescue Kuan from the Colonel. 5\\\\. At the abandoned mill, the Colonel has taken over the place, having his men plant bombs all over the site and kill all of Chen's men except for Chen. He's keeping Chen alive until Chen's men arrive with Kuan. When he finally arrives, the Colonel's men kill Kuan's two escorts. Gunfire erupts between the Colonel's men and Shane's group. In the midst of the gunfire, Tia gets shot. Shane covers the wound, and tells Sergey to watch over her. Shane returns to fighting the Colonel's men, and Sergey lifts Tia up and starts carrying her to safety. Shane battles his way to the Colonel, who has Kuan as a hostage. 6\\\\. Shane and the Colonel open fire on each other, and they both run out of bullets. Shane brutally beats the Colonel up, and then gets Kuan out of there. The Colonel grabs a submachine gun, and leaves the room. Just as the Colonel is about to shoot Shane, Shane flips the switch and the bombs start detonating, and the Colonel is blown off of the catwalk he was on. 7\\\\. Vlad later makes sure Kuan can stay in the USA. Shane and Tia, having fallen for each other, set up home together in an isolated glacier-side mansion somewhere outside the USA.

Life and career  Kuehne was born in Austin on February 20, 1884. He was the youngest son of Franz and Langer Kuehne, immigrants from Germany. He took a BSc Civil Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin, and a BSc Architecture from MIT, where he was trained in the tradition of the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. After graduating in 1908, he worked in Boston before being asked to organize an architecture program in the College of Engineering of the University of Texas in 1910. He served as an adjunct professor at the university from 1910 until 1915, when he entered private practice.Hugo Franz Kuehne, Handbook of Texas Online Other than a period of work for the Department of the Interior during the Great Depression, he continued in the private practice of architecture until retiring in 1961. Kuehne married Sybil Glass in 1923. They had two children, including a son with whom the elder Kuehne was in partnership at the close of his career. He died in Austin on November 23, 1963.  Architectural works  Among Kuehne's most noted works is Austin Public Library (now the Austin History Center). His other significant commercial projects in Austin include the Bohn Brothers building (1929), the Ritz Theater (1929), the Steck Building (1932), the Commodore Perry Hotel (1950), the International Life Building (1952), the American National Bank, and the Texas Department of Public Safety building (1952). He also designed alterations for Brackenridge Hospital, completed in 1933, and buildings for the Austin State Hospital. Kuehne led a team that designed a number of large houses in the Neoclassical and Colonial Revival styles. One notable example of these houses is the Cox-Craddock House, a Colonial Revival house 720 East 32nd Street built in 1928 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 30, 2001. Kuehne designed the house for Robert A. and Linda Cox, both economics professors at the University of Texas. A subsequent owner, businessman Larry Inge Craddock, enclosed the piazza and sleeping porch on the east end of the house. The current owner has restored the piazza to Kuehne's original open design and railing. The Cox- Craddock is built of brick and has a \\"symmetrical composition, 12:12 windows framed by a stone keystone and flat brick arch above and a stone sill.

She was best known as a portrait painter and painted portraits of Queen Alexandra, Queen Mary, Princess Margaret and at least five portraits of the present Queen Elizabeth II. She also painted President Warren Harding, Henry Ford and Field Marshal Slim. Although Williams gained considerable recognition and was famous in her lifetime, her work has been neglected since. Early life Williams was born in Cardiff, the eldest of the two daughters of Samuel A. Williams, a shipbroker of Barry Docks and Martha Margaret Lindsay, who was of Scottish descent. For some years, from the age of 9, she lived in 9 Windsor Road, Barry. Wiliams studied at Cardiff School of Art, winning a gold medal for art in 1904. In 1905 she enrolled at the Pelham Street School of Painting in Kensington to prepare for entering the Royal Academy in 1906. At the Royal Academy School she won several prizes including a gold medal in 1911 for her work The City of Refuge. At the time she was the youngest artist to win a gold medal at the School and the first from Wales to so. Also in 1911 she established, with funds provided by her father, her own studio at Eaton Terrace in St John's Wood. The following year she won a travel scholarship and, on the advice of John Singer Sargent, spent eighteen months studying in Italy and Holland. In March 1914 Williams held her first solo exhibition, showing some 58 paintings at the New Galleries in Cardiff. World War One At the outbreak of World War One, Williams wrote and lobbied David Lloyd George for an appointment as an official war artist with the Welsh Division in France. While Lloyd-George thought it a good idea for the regiment to have an artist attached, he would not allow a women to go that close to the front line and refused her request. Lloyd-George did support her application to work for the Ministry of Information but that also came to nothing. Williams did supply the illustrations for a 1915 prose anthology organised by Margaret Lloyd George to support the National Fund for Welsh Troops. The illustrations were of scenes from Welsh legends and Williams returned to this theme for her 1916 Royal Academy picture and for a 1917 illustrated book. In 1915 Williams organised an exhibition of her work in Cardiff to raise money for the Netley Military Hospital, which led to her receiving a number of commissions for very large works. These included Cardiff Royal Infirmary during the Great War painted in 1916 and her depiction of the scene in Cardiff City Hall when David Lloyd George unveiled a series of marble statues of Welsh heroes. This work included 114 individual portraits and involved several visits to Downing Street to paint Lloyd George and members of the Cabinet. Her largest single painting was of the Welsh National Service held in Westminster Abbey in June 1918 in support of the Welsh Prisoners of War Fund. Williams spent two years working on the 20 by 16-foot canvas in the Abbey itself before finding a studio large enough to accommodate the picture. She spent a further year on the work, which eventually included some 150 portraits, most notably of Queen Alexandra and her daughter Princess Victoria. The work was commissioned by the shipping magnate Lord Glanely who presented it to the City of Cardiff, where it still hangs in the city's Law Courts. Later works By the end of World War One, Williams was a successful and established artist. During the War and the early 1920s, Williams painted a number of imaginative works with religious overtones, notably The Devil's Daughter in 1917, The Triumph in 1918, The Imprisoned Soul of 1920 and The Menace from 1925. By the mid-1920s Williams had decided to concentrate on portrait work. She received a steady stream of commissions and although based in London, painted the portraits of several generations of prominent Welsh families including several members of the Morgan family, owners of the Cardiff department store, and of the Novello Davies family, including Ivor Novello. In London she had a patron in Lord Riddell, who sat for four portraits and obtained other commissions for her. Most notable of these was the large scale work, St Paul's Cathedral Thanksgiving Service, shown at the Royal Academy in 1933 and painted to mark the re-opening of the Cathedral after five years of restoration work. This large group portrait included both George V and Queen Mary. Williams painted a further portrait of Queen Mary in 1938 for St Thomas' Hospital and among her other royal commissions were portraits of Princess Margaret, presented to South Africa by a businessman in 1937, Prince Charles, Princess Anne and at least five portraits of the present Queen Elizabeth II including one of her as a young Princess. Williams visited the United States at least five times during her life and in 1922 was commissioned to paint a near life-size portrait of President Warren Harding. Other notable commissions included portraits of Henry Ford, Field Marshal Slim and the decorative scheme for the Cardiff home of Sir William James. Williams exhibited with the South Wales Art Society throughout her life and although she became a Vice-President of the Society in 1931 she only infrequently visited Wales after 1934, when her parents moved to London. Although her house in Hamilton Terrace in St Johns Wood was the location of several parties and receptions, particularly when she had new works to show, Williams otherwise appears to have led a somewhat solitary existence and never married. She maintained a somewhat academic and formal style to her paintings, although there was often an energetic quality to her portraits, and she avoided being influenced by developments in the contemporary art world. Williams was a lifelong Welsh Congregationalist and her funeral took place in the Windsor Road Congregational Church in Barry and she is buried in Barry Cemetery.

It is within the boundary of Keweenaw County and Isle Royale National Park, a national park located within the U.S. state of Michigan. It is the westernmost point marked on most maps of the elongated archipelago that makes up this park. However, a small islet called Bottle Island and an even smaller shoal that breaks the lake surface, Rock of Ages, are located further westward. Washington Island is approximately long and wide. Like the rest of the Isle Royale archipelago, the island is an ancient ridge of basalt oriented from the southwest to the northeast. Washington Island is separated by Grace Harbor from Isle Royale. It has relatively low visitation, with the majority of day trippers being sea kayakers from nearby Windigo Ranger Station. The waters of Lake Superior around Washington Island are notoriously dangerous, however, and inexperienced kayakers are not encouraged to navigate them. Many Great Lakes boats and lake freighters have succumbed to the stormy waters that surround Washington Island. The nearby 1908 lighthouse and light tower, Rock of Ages Light, tries to warn boats away from these dangerous waters.

Irving Erickson, (Chicago: Covenant Press, 1976) p. 111. Biography Rosenius was born in Nys√§tra in V√§sterbotten. His father, Anders Rosenius, was a parish pastor, who supported the revival movement in Sweden. His mother, Sarah Margaret Norenius, was the daughter of a clergyman. When Carl Olof was thirteen, his family moved to the town of S√§var. While living there he attended schools in Pite√•, Ume√• and H√§rn√∂sand. His religious breakthrough came at the age of fifteen. Even then he led the school holiday conventicles. A sermon that he delivered in H√§rn√∂sand in 1833 is said to have surprised Bishop Franz√©n because of its emphasis on the central Lutheran doctrine of justification by faith. In 1838 Rosenius began his theological studies at the University of Uppsala but was forced to give them up after a year due to failing health and financial difficulties. He instead found employment as a tutor at L√§nna farm outside of Stockholm. At this point he was beset with serious religious doubts. In Stockholm he met the Methodist minister George Scott, who helped dispel his uncertainties. He abandoned his plans of becoming a priest and moved to Stockholm to assist Scott in his ministry. He had a room there near H√∂torget (Haymarket Square) on the premises of the Engelska kyrka (English church), which was not affiliated with the Church of England but financed by the Foreign Evangelical Society. In 1842 Scott had to leave Sweden, and the English church ceased operations. Rosenius did not, however, curtail his activities. He became a leader in the growing religious revival of Sweden, traveling throughout the country, preaching both at private gatherings (conventicles) and in public halls. When the Swedish Evangelical Mission was formed in 1856, Rosenius was one of its founders.The Story of Our Hymns by Ernest Edwin Ryden, (Rock Island, IL: Augustana Book Concern, 1930) pp. 180-182. A year later the organization bought the English church's old building and reopened it as Bethlehem Church. He continued to edit and publish Pietisten, the monthly that he and Scott had started and worked on ‚ÄúThe Mission‚Äù and several other magazines. During his last years he wrote an extensive series of articles on the Epistle to the Romans that appeared in Pietisten. On Pentecost Sunday, 1867, Rosenius suffered a stroke in the pulpit of St. John's Church in Gothenburg. He died the following year. Legacy Grave of Carl Olof Rosenius in Stockholm Rosenius' pietism retained key features of the northern Swedish religious revival with Lutheran objective atonement and justification by grace alone at its core. He was on friendly terms with the Herrnhuters and had much in common with the Finnish evangelist Fredrik Gabriel Hedberg, despite believing that he went too far in the direction of antinomianism. Evidence of Scott‚Äôs Methodist faith was more apparent in Rosenius‚Äô evangelistic work than in his theology. He was strongly disliked by the followers of Erik Jansson. Large parts of the Church of Sweden dismissed him initially. He did not use the Swedish hymnbook but rather song collections of a more personal religious nature, including those published by Oscar Ahnfelt. Throughout his life Rosenius remained a member of the Swedish Church, baptizing his children and taking Communion in that faith and rejecting separation and the free distribution of Communion. He had a number of disciples. Among them was a lay preacher from Sm√•land named Nicolaus Bergensk√∂ld, who immigrated to the United States in the 1860s and was a leader of the revivalist movement in the Scandinavian settlements of the Midwest. Rosenius had a strong influence on Sweden's religious development during the 19th century. His commitment to personal involvement in religious belief affected not only the practices of the Free Church but also those of the State Church, especially in northern and central Sweden. In his time he became one of Sweden's most widely read religious writers and a leading figure in the religious revival of the country. He also played an important role in the formation of Evangeliska Fosterlandsstiftelsen (The Swedish Evangelical Mission).

They felt the need for an inspirational venue to act as catalyst for the exchange of ideas and experiences. The response was overwhelmingly enthusiastic and as a result their movement gained momentum and materialised into a yearly symposium organised by a board of five students, guided by two different advisory boards. Background A group of students from the University of Leiden, The Netherlands, founded the VeerStichting in 1978. The purpose of setting up the foundation was to promote the debate between students and the so-called ‚Äòdesigners of society‚Äô. That idea of promoting interaction between different generations still forms the foundation of the now illustrious VeerStichting. This takes place through a symposium with national and international top speakers. Bringing together different generations is the main goal. Not only do these meetings take place among top speakers from several disciplines and great thinkers from other branches of sport; it also revolves around connections between different generations, through which fresh and new ideas can be created. From students of applied physics to legal scholars; from CEOs to artists, they all spend two days bursting to share everything they have. The symposium Since its inception, the VeerStichting has grown into an annual two-day symposium that takes place in Leiden. Participants include 250 students from all Dutch and Flemish universities and 250 ‚Äòdesigners‚Äô from the worlds of business, politics, science, interest groups, sports and the arts. It is a platform where ambitious young students have an opportunity to meet with those who have already made a substantial contribution to society, and vice versa. Through the high level of both speakers and participants, this gathering is a source of energy and inspiration that often results in innovative insights for everyone. This is a meeting of current leaders and the leaders of the future, and provides opportunities to build bridges between different generations. With lectures and interludes that challenge the way the participants think about human behaviour and society as a whole, the symposium is all about exchanging visions and ideas. Philosophical themes, in which humanity, organisations and society overlap, are central. The themes reflect upcoming trends and stimulate participants into lively discussions, which ensures the very special atmosphere and sense of openness. The symposium may be characterized by the open and relaxed atmosphere in which the emphasis lies on the participants‚Äô own contribution. The board invites a set of national and international speakers who provide their insights and ideas on the theme during the plenary sessions. During the lectures, seminars, and intermezzi the exchange of ideas and personal experiences form a key element. Traditionally, the plenary sessions, drinks, and dinner are set at the Saint Peter's Church in Leiden Themes Subjects at the cutting edge of humanity, organisations and society are discussed at the symposium. Topics often cover subjects that the participants do not consider on a daily basis, but with which they are still regularly confronted. Group photo of the participants of the Veerstichting in 1994Participants Traditionally the participants are divided into two equal groups: 250 students and 250 non-students participate during the conference. In order to guarantee a high level of discussion and participation, non-students are invited by the board on a personal basis. Participants are drawn from a diverse set of backgrounds. Non-students are collectively referred to as ‚Äòthose who shape our society': they include policy-makers, business men, scientists, politicians, journalists, and artists. Students are selected on the basis of their essay. The Board aims to gather a diverse body of students to guarantee a well-rounded discussion. Participating students come from all Dutch and Flemish universities. The encounter between young and old and between many different points of view has proved to be a refreshing and inspiring experience. At the conference, subjects that are discussed lie at the intersection of organizations, society and the individual. The themes tend to deal with the kind of theoretical ideas that confront the participants from time to time rather than with problems of daily working life. The event is frequently attended by Princess Beatrix Speakers Each symposium traditionally features a mixture of international and Dutch speakers related to an annual theme. The speakers are alternated by interludes, masterclasses and surprises such as salsa lessons, meditation and laughing therapy. Former speakers at the symposium include: Dr. F.W.

Nestle was giving away records of it to people who sent in three wrappers from 6d chocolate bars, as well as 1s 6d. The Copyright Act 1956 s 8 said a 6.25% royalty needed to be paid on the ‚Äòordinary retail selling price‚Äô to the owners of copyrights. Nestle said 1s 6d was the ordinary retail selling price, but Chappell & Co argued that it should be more and sought an injunction for breach of CA 1956 s 8. In this way the question arose as to whether the wrappers constituted partial consideration for the records. Mr Justice Upjohn granted an injunction, the Court of Appeal (Lords Justices Jenkins and Ormerod; Lord Justice Romer dissenting) reversed his decision, and Chappell & Co appealed. Judgment The majority of the House of Lords (Lord Reid, Lord Tucker and Lord Somervell of Harrow) held that the wrappers (although of trivial economic value and ultimately thrown away by Nestle) were part of the consideration; Section 8 of the Copyright Act 1956 was intended to apply where a money sum was the entire consideration for the sale and since this sale was outside of s. 8 copyright had been breached.

These cells have a tubular shape and form an anastomosis (bridge) that allows fusion between conidia. CATs and germ tubes (germination tubes) are some of the specialized hyphae (long cells formed by filamentous fungal species) that are formed by fungal conidia. CATs are morphologically and physiologically distinct from germ tubes and are under separate genetic control. Germ tubes, produced during conidial germination, are different from CATs because: CATs are thinner, shorter, lack branches, exhibit determinate growth, and home toward each other. CAT biology is not completely understood. Initially, conidia are induced to form CATs. Once they are formed, they grow homing toward each other, and eventually they fuse. Once fusion occurs, the respective nuclei can pass through the fused CATs from one conidium to the other. These are events of fungal vegetative growth (asexual reproduction) and not sexual reproduction. Part of the CAT fusion (cell fusion) have been shown to be a coordinated behaviour.Fleissner, A.; Leeder, A.; Roca M., M.G.; Read, N.D.; Glass, N.L. (2009). Oscillatory recruitment of signaling proteins to the cell tips promotes coordinated behaviour during cell fusion. PNAS. 106(46): 19387‚Äì19392. The filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa (a bread mould and fungal model organism) produces CATs from conidia and conidial germ tubes. In contrast, the fungal plant pathogen, Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, only produces CATs from conidia and not from germ tubes. Fusion between these cells seems to be important for some fungi during early stages of colony establishment. The production of these cells has been suggested to occur in 73 different species of fungi. Roca, M.G., Read, N.D.; Wheals, A. E. (2005). Conidial anastomosis tubes in filamenotus fungi.

Junior Quinton Jones brought Boise State to within six when he took a Johnny Ayers punt 92 yards for a touchdown with less than four minutes to play in the game, but Boise State's last drive from midfield with less than two minutes stalled and Zabransky threw an end-zone interception to seal the Eagles' win.

It contains many direct parallels and allusions to the 1973 film The Wicker Man, which was also directed by Hardy,\\"'Wicker Man' Companion Piece, 'The Wicker Tree', Gets an Official Website\\". bloody-disgusting.com. and is intended as a companion piece which explores the same themes. The film premiered at the Fantasia Festival in Montreal, Canada, July 2011 and was released on Blu-ray in the UK on 30 April 2012.Sarah Dobbs, Robin Hardy interview, SciFiNow (UK), 20 April 2012. Accessed 4 December 2012 Plot Beth Boothby (Nicol) is a successful born-again evangelical pop singer from Texas. She and her fianc√© Steve Thompson (Garrett) both wear purity rings and belong to a group known as the \\"Cowboys for Christ\\", who travel to \\"heathen areas\\" of the world to preach Christianity. The Reverend Moriarty sends them off to Glasgow, hoping to save some souls there. However, they're shocked at their very negative reception, and nobody accepts their pamphlets. They're approached by Sir Lachlan Morrison (McTavish), the laird of the small village of Tressock in the Scottish Lowlands, and his wife Delia (Leonard), who invite them back with them to preach. They actually intend them for a more central part in Tressock's May Day celebration. The villagers of Tressock have become infertile after the construction of Sir Lachlan's nuclear power plant. While out riding a horse, Steve has sex with female villager Lolly (Weeks), whom he finds bathing nude in a spring. Steve regrets his actions and wants to return home. During a flashback Sir Lachlan remembers a mentor (Lee) from his youth. Meanwhile, a detective named Orlando is sent to Tressock, posing as the local police officer to secretly investigate reports of a pagan cult. Orlando discovers that the people of the village worship the ancient Celtic goddess Sulis from Lolly after having sex with her on multiple occasions. Beth and Steve decide to begin their preaching at Tressock's May Day celebrations. To impress the locals, they agree to become the local Queen of the May and the Laddie for the festival, not realising the consequences of this decision. Steve is chased by villagers on horseback as part of a ritual and ends up being torn apart. Back in Sir Lachlan's house, the Morrisons' butler Beame (Russell) attempts to sedate Beth to prepare her for her role as the May Queen. He had tried this the night before, but the spiked milk killed the Morrisons' cat. Beth attacks Beame and flees, but is captured in town. After discovering Steve's death, Beth confronts Sir Lachlan at the wicker tree. She pushes Lachlan into the structure and sets it on fire, killing him. Beth tries to escape from Tressock with the help of one of the few children left in the village. She is captured and later killed. Her body is preserved and put on display in a room with the previous May Queens. Lolly gives birth to Steve's child and brings a new generation to Tressock for the first time in years. Delia prays to the setting sun for the gods to find more men to bring to Tressock to sire more children.

Sean Astin had signed on as the male lead, with Christopher Lee, LeAnn Rimes and Vanessa Redgrave set to play major roles. Lee had passed the screenplay on to Astin while the two were working on the Lord of the Rings film trilogy. Ewan McGregor also read the script, and requested a cameo appearance. Of the story, Hardy stated, \\"It's about a certain kind of American innocence abroad featuring two young born-again Christians. They've made a pact not to have sex before marriage, and they come over here like the Mormons and preach door-to-door. It's a thriller; they get sucked into a dark world. We hope to start in September for a 2003 release.\\" The film was to be shot on location near Glasgow and in Oklahoma. Hardy was ultimately unable to secure funding, and the film was cancelled. He then adapted his screenplay into a novel, which was published as Cowboys for Christ. Hardy felt that writing the novel gave him a much clearer idea of what he wanted to do, and he eventually adapted the novel into the screenplay which was used for The Wicker Tree. Casting Originally Hardy wrote the part of Sir Lachlan Morrison for Christopher Lee, who played Lord Summerisle in The Wicker Man. While filming the newest Hammer production The Resident in New Mexico, Lee injured his back when he tripped over power cables on set. Although very disappointed, Hardy gave the role intended for Lee to Graham McTavish, the actor who had originally been cast as Beame, the Morrisons' butler. Clive Russell plays Beame instead. Lee is still in the film, making a brief cameo appearance as the unnamed \\"Old Gentleman\\" who acts as Lachlan's mentor in a flashback. Robin Hardy has stated that fans of The Wicker Man will recognise this character as Lord Summerisle, but Lee himself has contradicted this, stating that they are two unrelated characters. Joan Collins was originally set to play Lady Delia Morrison when Lee was to play Sir Lachlan Morrison. However, when Lee injured himself and was replaced by the much younger McTavish, Collins was similarly replaced with a younger actress, Jacqueline Leonard. Filming Filming was due to start in September 2007, but the film was delayed for financial reasons. It was later announced the film would shoot from April 2008 in Dumfries and Galloway. A week before the shoot, Dumfries and Galloway Council announced the filming had been stopped due to financial reasons.\\"UK  Scotland  South of Scotland  Cult film sequel shoot called off\\". news.bbc.co.uk; BBC News. 3 April 2008.

History After Hood stopped buying milk from the farms involved, they approached several other companies, including Horizon Organic, Stonyfield Farm and Organic Valley, as well as local producers, about the possibility of selling milk to them, but were rejected. In April 2009, the group made an agreement with Smiling Hill Farm, a local milk producer, for processing, and Oakhurst Dairy agreed to transport the products. Funding for MOOMilk, which needed $500,000 to begin operations, was provided by the state of Maine, as well as from private sources, including Stonyfield Farm. At its beginning, MOOMilk sold milk to Hannaford, Associated Grocers of Maine and dozens of independent stores in Maine. The company began selling milk in January 2010, but within a year ran into financial troubles. Its revenue was inadequate, and it relied on a mix of private investment and grant money to continue operating. With a minimal advertising budget, the company struggled to find consumers willing to purchase its milk, and several of its founding members left. By September 2010, with only $1,400 in cash assets, the company was forced to partially stop production of milk. At the time, the company was able to pay bills to its farmers, but was unable to cover its overhead costs. In December 2010, Whole Foods Market stores in Massachusetts began selling MOOMilk products, but even so, the company still needed outside money in order to survive.

They are known to operate primarily in the Western Cape prison of Pollsmoor; however, it is believed that they are present in most South African prisons. Origin The Numbers Gang was started in the late 1800s, supposedly to protect mineworkers. The origins of the gang remain uncertain at best. Amongst gang members, the likely apocryphal story of Nongoloza and Ngeleketshane is claimed as the gang's origin. The Numbers Gang story holds that a man named Po became alarmed by the exploitation of miners in late 1800s South Africa. Po allegedly befriended a young Zulu called Nongoloza who said he was on his way to the mines to look for work, and Ngeleketshane, a member of the Pondo tribe. Po eventually recruited 15 young men. He taught them a secret language and highway robbery. The men robbed travellers and colonial outposts of their goods. The gang chose to change their habits to avoid being caught. They moved from cave to cave and split themselves into two groups: Ngeleketshane with his seven men who robbed by day, and Nongoloza and his six men who robbed by night. Po ordered the two men to carve their daily outlaw activities on a nearby rock which would serve as a diary. Po then ordered the two men to visit a farm, owned by a Mr. Rabie, and to buy one of his bulls called Rooiland (Red Earth). Mr. Rabie was suspicious, and refused to sell the two men the bull. The two youths refused to leave without carrying out their order, and proceeded to stab the farmer with bayonets and then steal the bull, and slaughter it for a feast. Po ordered the men to take the hide of the bull and press it onto the diary rock until the words from the rock were imprinted on the hide. There were now two copies of the gang's ways, and Po explained that the bandits must follow the rules as they had been set out from the beginning. The two items were divided between the two men: Nongoloza received the hide and Ngeleketshane received the rock. The two were instructed to carry them wherever they went. The rock, however, proved too awkward to carry and one day it was accidentally dropped down a hill. It split into two pieces, one of which fell into a river. This left Ngeleketshane's gang with only half of the gang's laws. The first conflict between the two gangs took place because of this incident. The two gangs decided to embark on a joint expedition, but Nongoloza said he was sick and stayed behind. He asked one of Ngeleketshane's soldiers, Magubane, to stay behind with him. Upon returning, Ngeleketshane found Nongoloza engaged in homosexual acts with Magubane. Enraged, Kilikijan challenged Nongoloza to a fight. Nongoloza replied that according to the hide, sex between bandits was allowed in order to avoid contact with women. Kilikijan retaliated by saying that he didn't trust Nongoloza, believing he had added this law to the hide after half of the rock was lost. The two men fought until they were both drenched in blood, and Po arrived to intervene. Po listened to both men's sides of the story. He then told Ngeleketshane to travel to the mines to see if men were engaging in sex with one another. Ngeleketshane found that this did indeed take place, but opinions remained divided as to whether this justified Nongoloza's act. This would become the pivotal disagreement between the two gangs that persists to this day. Po had informed the men that at the entrance of his cave was an old assegai, and if the men found the tip of the assegai rusted, it would mean that Po had died. Due to the death of Po, a final decision on whether sexual intercourse between men was allowed never came to pass. After Po's death the two gangs decided to go their separate ways: Nongoloza's gang with its now eight men (including Magubane, whom he decided to take with him), and Kilikijan's gang with its seven. It is said that this is where the numbers \\"27\\" and \\"28\\" originated, with the number \\"2\\" symbolizing the two leaders. The gangs agree that the day and night would still be divided between them as it had always been. The gangs continued to roam the countryside until they both ended up in Point Prison in Durban. At Point Prison they encountered a group of six men, led by a man named Grey, who were franse (non-gangsters). The six men would sit in a circle and flip a single silver coin between them. Nongoloza demanded that the men hand over their possessions to him; they refused. Later Ngeleketshane told him that these men were skilled smugglers and gamblers who had helped him in his early days in prison.Van Onselen, New Babylon, New Nineveh, 368‚Äì397. A fight broke out between Nongoloza and Ngeleketshane about the future of the gamblers. Ngeleketshane defended the gamblers against the 28s' sexual appetites, which was what Nongoloza wanted them for. After many disagreements Nongoloza finally decided that the new group would be called the \\"26s\\". This name was chosen because they had six men but also because Nongoloza wanted to indicate their inferior status. Nongoloza informed Ngeleketshane that he and his men would have to answer for the actions of the 26s. Finally the three camps were formed. The 26s were responsible for gambling, smuggling and accruing wealth in general. The 28s were the warriors and responsible for fighting on behalf of all three groups, and the 27s were the guardians of gang law and the peace keepers between all the gangs. New rules and a strict code of conduct were drawn up. It was decided that when a gangster broke a rule, the blood of a warder or franse (non-gangster) must be spilled to set things right. Numbers  26s  The 26s' duty is to accumulate wealth for all the numbers.Haysom, N. (1981). Towards an understanding of prison gangs Institute of Criminology, University of Cape Town. The 26s have no private line and a wyfie may not join the gang. Although a member of the 26s may take a wyfie for himself, it is strictly against the laws as set out in the book of 26s. The gang has a very specific hierarchy, structured as follows: : ;The Number Ones :(Top Structure) * Government Makwezie * General Number 1 * Inspector Number 1 * Doctor Number 1 * Maballaan (clerk) Number 1 * Prokureur (Lawyer) Number 1 * Landdros Number 1 (magistrate) * Judge Number 1 * Captain Number 1 ;The Number twos :(Secondary Structure) * General number 2 * Inspector number 2 * Doctor number 2 * Maballaan number 2 * Judge number 2 * Captain number 2 * Sergeant Major * Sergeant number 1 * Sergeant number 33 * The Heksman (guard) * Soldiers In the number 2s and the number 1s there is a number 1's and number 2's twelve point ring, for number 4's and 5's, but not 6's or 7's, who have an 11 point ring, unless they're number 8's, which make gang decisions according to their jurisdictions. Each rank has its own assigned office and duties which include training lower rank members in the duties and codes of the gang.Schurink, W. J. (1989). The world of the Wetslaners: an analysis of some organisational features in South African prisons. Acta Criminologica 2:2, 60‚Äì70. The 26s have historically been considered an inferior gang and have lived in the shadow of the 28s; however, in some prisons they have risen up against the 28s and taken control of the prison (see \\"general elections\\", below), such as in Westville. 28s The 28s are the blood line of the gang and are responsible for fighting on behalf of the three gangs (26, 27 and 28). They are divided into two lines ‚Äì the gold line and the silver line. Haysom's study (1981) on prison gangs is based on Supreme Court trial records and supplemented with some interviews with ex-offenders. Schurink's paper (1989) summarises the findings of a study on prison gangs commissioned by the Department of Correctional Services. For this study, in-depth interviews were conducted with sixty prisoners, mainly coloured men serving in St Albans and Brandvlei prisons. Prisoners were also encouraged to write about their prison experiences, providing a number of personal manuscripts. The gold line are the warriors, the descendants of Nongoloza. They fight the gang's battles. The silver line are the female, and are the descendants of Magubane. They are considered to be the sex slaves of the gold line. The emblem of the 28s is the Zulu shield, whose skin is made out of the legendary Rooiland cow's remains. In the 28s it is important to prove your manhood and move up in the rankings. A member moves up the ranks through the stabbing or killing of rival gangs, prison guards, or disobedient members. Should a member stay in the lower ranks, he will be considered a woman and will be sexually abused until he proves his manhood. Recruitment into the 28s When a new prisoner is assigned a cell he will be introduced to the person in charge of that cell, known as the \\"cell cleaner\\". The cell cleaner will welcome the new prisoner to the cell, and will either leave him alone for the evening, or will demand sex. The new prisoners will be observed by a senior member of the gang known as \\"die glas\\" (the binoculars). The glas' job is to conduct gang business in die bos (the bush), the parts of the prison where the 28s are not active. The glas will confront a potential new recruit and give him a riddle. How the new prisoner answers the riddle will determine which department of the gang he will fall under. The glas will generally watch the way new members interact with other franse (non-gang members). He will watch how the new prisoner deals with conflict, the way he solves problems, and the way he walks and talks. The glas then approaches the new prisoner and says, \\"I am going to ask you a question. Think very carefully before answering. It is raining. You are standing under an umbrella. I say to you, I am getting wet; I may get sick. What are you going to do?\\" The new inmate's answer will determine his future in the prison. If he says, \\"I invite you to share my umbrella,\\" he will become a sex slave and will not become a member of the 28s. If he says, \\"I will come out into the rain with you,\\" it means that he is prepared to live like the other man; they are brothers and they will live and die together. After the glas is satisfied with the answer of the new inmate, he is given a task to become a member. This task could either be the fatal or non-fatal stabbing of another inmate or warden. The new recruit will be given a knife whose length is determined by another senior member of the gang known as the nyangi (the doctor). If the gang wants the stabbing to be fatal, the nyangi will give the new recruit a longer blade; if the gang wants a non-lethal stabbing, he will be given a shorter blade. Once the stabbing has taken place all the gang members watching will shout, \\"Nangampela!\\"Nangampela\\" is an isiZulu word that means, literally, \\"There it is, indeed!\\" Die nommer is vol!\\" (The number is complete.) On a Sunday, the \\"day of rites\\", his ceremony is performed. He is once again ordered to stand in the middle of the room; however, this time he is surrounded by several people. The first person to approach him is the nyangi. The nyangi then takes a gold pipe and slaps it on the new recruit's right wrist, then takes a silver pipe and slaps it on the new recruit's left wrist. He then checks the recruit's pulse and declares either \\"Die man se pols klop twee keer per jaar\\" (This man's pulse beats twice a year) or \\"Die man se pols klop drie keer per jaar'\\" (This man's pulse beats three times a year). If he says that his pulse beats twice, it means the new recruit is being recruited into the silver line; if three times, it means he is being recruited into the gold line. The gwenza (senior member) then places a handkerchief on the floor and slips a knife under it. He stands and says to the recruit: \\"From today you are no longer a franse. You are a 28. You will never swear at your brother. You will never hurt your brother. You will never do anything that reflects badly on the camp. If you leave the camp, you leave by your own blood.\\" The landdros (magistrate) will then come forward and take out his colored stamps and give the new member his approval. The landdros carries four stamps ‚Äì white, green, red and black, which signify the four hooves on the Rooiland. The stamps signify promotion. When a member of the silver line is promoted, the landdros takes out his green and white stamp; if the member is from the gold line, he takes out the green and the red stamps. The black stamp is reserved for the death sentence. The end of the ceremony is signalled by the new recruit being marched out of the circle. The 28s then take the new recruit to the 26s and 27s. The new recruit will sleep alongside different members of the 28 gang and be told what his duties are. He will also begin to learn the history of Nongoloza and Kilikijan. It will only be a brief fragment of the story, for he is still too junior to hear the whole story. The 40s are senior but inactive due to being too old or too injured for active duty. Another reason a person could be a mamboza is because his position has already being filled by another member. A prison cannot have two active nyangis, for example, and if another nyangi is transferred from another prison he is considered dormant ‚Äì he sleeps in the 40s. The mambozas begin to teach the new member to sabela (speak prison language). It is a long and gruelling process. The new member has to sabela all day and night with his blackboard (teacher). In the first two months a new member is not allowed to receive visits, write letters or read books. They must focus on the number gang. If somebody learns too slowly, the punishments are severe. New members can be stripped of all their clothes and thrown into an ice cold shower until they \\"find the number\\" (get it right). One of the last things new members learn is about a position in the silver line held by a man named Mtjoetijies. This man is dead, but his place in the hierarchy is left empty. Legend has it that Mtjoetijies was a translator for Nongoloza, who refused to speak the language of the white oppressor. Nongoloza grew increasingly wary about what Mtjoetijies was saying to the white officers, and decided to kill him as a precaution. The position remains open as a reminder that the 28s do not negotiate with words, they negotiate with action. This ritual, however, has now changed. The fundamental principles remain the same; however, in modern 28 law the man who trains you is now also allowed to have sex with you. This change came along because of the war between the silver and gold lines of the number. The 28s War In the late '80s a decision was taken to stop bloodlines (no stabbing). The silver line complained that the gold line were now not doing their jobs. The gold line complained about the silver line being greedy with food. In the days when the bloodlines were still open the gold line members had a very strict diet to follow as they were not allowed to get fat. For example, they were not allowed to eat eggs and were never allowed sugar with their coffee or porridge. All these items went to the silver lines instead. Upon the closing of the bloodlines the gold line demanded that they get the food they wanted since there was no longer a need to stay fit. The silver line refused, and thus the gold line declared war on the silver line. Within months hostilities had ceased. The hospital beds were filled with soldiers from the 28 gang. The gold line formally offered their surrender. The silver line then set out their terms. They closed down the gold line and vowed that it would never be opened again. They threw the soldiers out of their ranks and filled these ranks with silver line members. They then decreed that nobody would have to take blood to join the 28s again. They also changed the initiation rules: they stated that any person who wished to join the 28s had to have sex with their teacher. The rule of the blood has, however, changed. Modern members are now expected both to kill upon order of their general, as well as to have sex with their teacher. They are also expected to know the \\"Number\\" to the extent that the new members are often woken up in the middle of the night and asked the \\"Number\\"; if they get it wrong they either have to have sex with any fellow brother or are asked to kill another inmate. Relationships Relationship between the numbers The two 28s are not allowed to speak directly to the 26s. They communicate through the 27s. When the 28s recruit a new member, the 28s inform the 27s who then inform the 26s. This is seen as a \\"hands off\\" warning to the other gangs. Relationships with franse (non gang members) The numbers gangs refer to themselves as ndodas (men) and refer to non-gang members as franse. The franse is stripped of his juridical personhood. He is not seen as a human to the gangs. The franse must submit everything they have to the ndodas, but the franse are protected from the numbers by being housed in different cells. Relationship with warders The relationship between gang members and the warders is a complex and an uneasy one. Under the apartheid regime they feared the warders. They knew that the warders would not be watched by human rights groups, so when there was a stabbing of an officer the warders would beat the gang members to within an inch of their lives. Under the new system, however, the warders have become targets. The numbers gangs are well aware that the consequences of their actions will not result in a beating or the death penalty, and therefore new initiates are encouraged to stab a warden or even to attempt to take his eye out of the socket. One of the most compelling messages that the numbers gang members like to send to the warders is by holding up a mirror toward the warden. This derives from the traditional practice of holding up an image of an inmate. The message the numbers are said to be sending is, \\"We are what you are. You are an army, we are an army. Where you have a head of the prison, we will have a judge. Where you have a head of a section, we will have a general. Whatever you do to us, we will do to you in turn.\\" The numbers network One notable feature of the numbers gang is that it is a nationwide brotherhood that is prevalent in every prison across South Africa. Members that betray the gang are not safe in any South African prison, as the numbers control every prison in South Africa. The secretive nature of the gang makes their system of communicating to other prisons unknown. This is what makes them probably the most dangerous prison gang in the world. General elections Traditionally the 28 gang has been the dominant gang. This still holds true in prisons such as Pollsmoor prison. However, the balance of power now varies from prison to prison over time. When one of the number gangs feels it can take control of the prison, they declare a \\"general election\\" in which an all-out war is waged, often lasting up to two years, until one gang is declared the \\"ruling party\\". Two famous cases of these wars were in Belville prison (1967‚Äì1969) and in Brandvlei prison (1974‚Äì1976). In both cases the 26s were declared the \\"ruling party\\". Trial and punishment Punishments The gang has a strict code of conduct and failure to abide by these rules has severe consequences for the perpetrator. Upon the outcome of the trial a punishment is chosen. The ultimate punishment is death. An execution squad will carry out the order. They could possibly suffocate the offender in their bed or slit their throat. The death punishment is known as a \\"number one\\". The second worst punishment just short of death is to be raped by a prisoner that is known to carry HIV. This practice is known as \\"slow puncture\\". The offender's anus is cut open so it bleeds, thus ensuring infection. The gang holds the offender down and the HIV-infected prisoner proceeds to rape the offender. Less severe forms of punishment include \\"klappe\\" (hits), which involves 10 slaps to the face with an open hand, and the \\"beker\\" (mug), which involves blows on the head with a tin cup attached to a sock. Other forms of punishment include gang rape and what is known as a \\"carry on\\", in which the offender lifts up his arms and is beaten with padlocks, stick and cups. Punishments that do not involve any harm to the offender involve the murder of a non-gang member.  Other numbers gangs  There are other number gangs who are not recognised by the 26s, 27s and 28s. The Desperadoes are the 29s and the Big Five are the 25s, but they are referred to as \\"dirty dogs\\" and are not given the same status or respect as members of the numbers gang. Under certain conditions it is compulsory to kill a member of the Big Five gang.

From 1795 until 2001, the post was responsible for the production of charts for the Royal Navy, and around this post grew the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office (UKHO). In 2001, the post was disassociated from UKHO, and the Hydrographer of the Navy is now a title bestowed upon the current captain‚Äîhydrography and meteorology‚Äîon the staff of the Devonport Flotilla at HMNB Devonport. History Before the establishment of the post, captains of Royal Navy ships were responsible for the provision of their own charts. In practice this meant that ships often sailed with inadequate information for safe navigation, and that when new areas were surveyed, the data rarely reached all those who needed it. The Admiralty appointed Alexander Dalrymple as hydrographer on 12 August 1795, with a remit to gather and distribute charts to HM Ships. Within a year existing charts had been collated, and the first catalogue published. It was five years before the first chart‚Äîof Quiberon Bay in Brittany‚Äîwas produced by the Hydrographer. Under Dalrymple's successor, Captain Thomas Hurd, Admiralty charts were sold to the general public, and by 1825, there were 736 charts listed in the catalogue. In 1829, the first Sailing Directions were published, and in 1833, under Rear-Admiral Sir Francis Beaufort‚Äîof the eponymous Beaufort scale‚Äîthe tide tables were first published. Notices to Mariners came out in 1834, allowing for the timely correction of charts already in use. Beaufort was certainly responsible for a step change in output; by the time he left the office in 1855, the Hydrographic Office had a catalogue of nearly 2,000 charts and was producing over 130,000 charts, of which about half were provided to the Royal Navy and half sold. In 1939, on the outbreak of World War II, the Hydrographic Office moved to Taunton, and the post of hydrographer moved with it. In 2001, a chief executive was appointed to run the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office as a profit-making agency of the British government, and at this time the roles of National Hydrographer and Hydrographer of the Navy were divided. The title of hydrographer devolved to Captain (hydrography and meteorology), a senior officer on the staff of the Commodore of the Devonport Flotilla, and the senior Royal Navy officer within the HM branch. , the post has been renamed Captain (HM Ops), but continues to carry the title Hydrographer of the Navy.

It occurs when the aponeurosis of the adductor pollicis muscle becomes interposed between the ruptured ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) of the thumb and its site of insertion at the base of the proximal phalanx. No longer in contact with its insertion site, the UCL cannot spontaneously heal. Mechanism  In 1962, Bertil Stener described a lesion which he observed to occur in a subset of patients suffering from gamekeeper's thumb. In these patients, the distal attachment of the UCL was traumatically avulsed from its site of insertion at the base of the proximal phalanx of the thumb. The severed end of the ligament would become trapped under the aponeurosis of the adductor pollicis muscle and therefore be unable to return to its proper anatomic position. Consequently, the severed ligament would fold on itself and thus be prevented from healing and restoring stability to the MCP joint. For a Stener lesion to occur, both the proper and accessory collateral ligaments of the thumb must be completely ruptured. The Stener lesion is present in more than 80% of complete ruptures of the UCL of the thumb. Treatment The ulnar collateral ligament is an important stabilizer of the thumb. Thumb instability resulting from disruption of the UCL profoundly impairs the overall function of the involved hand. Because of this, it is critical that these injuries receive appropriate attention and treatment. Most gamekeeper's thumb injuries are treated by simply immobilizing the joint in a thumb spica splint or a modified wrist splint and allowing the ligament to heal. However, near total or total tears of the UCL may require surgery to achieve a satisfactory repair, especially if accompanied by a Stener lesion. History CS Campbell, an orthopedic surgeon, originally coined the term \\"gamekeeper's thumb\\" in 1955, after he observed this condition in a number of Scottish gamekeepers. The injury appeared to occur as a result of the particular manner in which they killed small animals such as rabbits. Specifically, the animals were placed on the ground, and their necks were broken as the gamekeeper exerted downward pressure with the thumb and index fingers. This maneuver would place a valgus force upon the abducted metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint. Over time, this would lead to insufficiency of the ulnar collateral ligament of the thumb, a condition which Campbell referred to as \\"gamekeeper's thumb\\".

It was extended to run from Shrewsbury and formed part of a main line trunk route, under the title The Shrewsbury and Chester Railway. It opened in 1846 from Chester to Ruabon, and in 1848 from Ruabon to Shrewsbury. It later merged with the Great Western Railway. Much of its main line ran through rural areas, but the important mineral area west of Wrexham, and also near Ruabon, led to considerable development of mineral business. A dense network of branches to access pits and ironworks built up, although the hilly terrain made railway construction difficult. At the end of the nineteenth century passenger services were put on for the mining communities. The main line business developed too, enabling the GWR to access the Mersey, from London and from South Wales, and a heavy long-distance mineral flow built up. That traffic dwindled steeply in the 1930s; the main line suffered from the handicap of reaching the west bank of the Mersey, and later it was reduced to the status of a secondary route. The original main line remains open. The North Wales Coalfield The North Wales Coalfield runs from near Talacre at the mouth of the River Dee through Wrexham to Oswestry. The coal and associated iron industries became particularly active from the early eighteenth century, but poor transport links to markets suppressed the potential of the trade.Peter E Baughan, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 11: North and Mid Wales, David St John Thomas Publisher, Nairn, 1991, , page 36 The Chester and Holyhead Railway was being promoted from 1836, and more actively from 1840, and the idea of a railway feeder to that line arose. This was promoted locally, titled the North Wales Mineral Railway. At first it was to include branches to coal pits and iron works, but these were dropped due to local opposition. It obtained the Royal Assent to its Act of Incorporation on 6 August 1844. It was to run from Wrexham to a wharf at Saltney, and a connection at the latter place to the Chester and Holyhead Railway, which was authorised in the same session. In the following Parliamentary session, on 21 July 1845 it was authorised to extend south from Wrexham to Ruabon. To get better access to the pits, it was to include a branch from a junction at Wheatsheaf, a little north of Wrexham, to Brymbo and Minera.E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway: volume I, 1833 to 1863, published by the Great Western Railway, 1927, part 1, pages 341 to 347Baughan, page 37 Further powers were taken the following year, on 27 July 1846, for short stubs to access collieries at Ffrwd, Brynmally, Brymbo and Vron. The line from Wheatsheaf to Minera was open in July 1847 and the local branches were ready and open in November 1847. Shrewsbury, Oswestry and Chester Railway The forecast for the main line disrupted when the Chester and Holyhead Railway proposed its own line south. This arose out of disagreements with the Grand Junction Railway, on which the CHR would depend for access to London. The CHR developed proposals for a line from Chester to Shrewsbury (to be called the Cheshire and Shropshire Junction Railway). Such a railway would hugely reduce the income of the North Wales Mineral Railway, so the NWMR promoted its own route from Ruabon to Shrewsbury, named the Shrewsbury, Oswestry and Chester Junction Railway. In Parliament it was this line that was authorised, on 30 June 1845, unopposed in Parliament, and the CHR scheme was turned down. Shrewsbury and Chester Railway formed The NWMR and the SO&CR; were allies, and their strength was in the end-to-end route. It made sense to combine formally, and on 27 July 1846 the Shrewsbury and Chester Railway was created by Act of Parliament. On the same day the Royal Assent was given to SO&CJR; proposals for a branch from Leaton to Wem, and from Gobowen via Oswestry to Crickheath (four miles south of Oswestry, to join a proposed Shropshire Union Railway branch there). The plans for the SO&CR; had been prepared hastily, and included an independent station at Shrewsbury. Negotiations with the promoters of other lines resulted in agreement for a joint station near the centre. The extension to this station was authorised in the amalgamation act; the joint station there was to be used also by the Shropshire Union Railway, the Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway, the Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway.Baughan, pages 37 to 40 The former NWMR main line from Ruabon (actually Rhosymedre, a little to the south) to Saltney, 15 miles, opened on 2 or 4 November 1846;Baughan, page 38 the section of the Chester and Holyhead Railway from Saltney into Chester opened on the same day, worked temporarily by the S&CR; as the C&HR; was not yet operational. There were five passenger trains each way daily. The Minera branch, with two rope-worked inclines and two tunnels, opened in July 1847, and two subsidiary branches off that line, to Ffrwd and Brynmally collieries opened in November 1847.Peter E Baughan, The Chester and Holyhead Railway, volume 1, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1972, , pages 15 to 22 The SO&CJR; main line of 25 miles opened from Ruabon to a temporary terminus at Shrewsbury on 14 or 16 October 1848;Baughan, page 39 the extension to the new joint station was opened on 1 June 1849. This was the first railway to enter Shrewsbury. There were two remarkable viaducts on the section between Ruabon and Shrewsbury, at Cefn over the Dee, and at Chirk over the River Ceiriog. The Dee viaduct is 510 yards in length, and was the largest in the country at the time of construction.Keith M Beck, The Great Western North of Wolverhampton, Ian Allan Limited, Shepperton, 1986, , page 9 Chester was promised a joint station by Act of 9 July 1847, to be used by S&CR;, C&HR; and LNWR trains; it opened on 1 August 1848. The Wem branch authorised in 1846 was never built, and the Crickheath branch was cut back to Oswestry from Gobowen; it opened on 23 December 1848. Dee Bridge failure The Shrewsbury and Chester Railway used a section of the Chester and Holyhead Railway to reach Chester itself. On 24 May 1847 a bridge on that railway over the River Dee not far from Chester failed, and six persons were killed. The C&HR; arranged for the bridge to be strengthened, and invited the S&CR; to resume normal operation, but the S&CR; waited for a Board of Trade inspection of the work; S&CR; trains resumed operation over the strengthened bridge from 26 July.Baughan, Chester and Holyhead Railway, page 109 Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway The London and Birmingham Railway had encouraged the formation of the Shrewsbury and Chester Railway, but the L&BR; itself merged with the Grand Junction Railway, forming the London and North Western Railway in July 1846. Now the LNWR viewed the S&CR; as an abstracter of business: with the Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway it would compete with the LNWR for traffic between the Mersey and London. However the Great Western Railway was building its line to Birmingham, so that an alignment with the GWR would benefit the S&CR; equally the LNWR would oppose any such linkage.E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway: volume I, 1833 to 1863, published by the Great Western Railway, 1927, part 1, pages 348 to 354 The Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway had been authorised in 1846, though the section south of Wolverhampton to Birmingham was omitted, in favour of the Stour Valley Line. A Birkenhead, Lancashire and Cheshire Junction Railway had opened in 1840, between Birkenhead and Chester, and the Shrewsbury railways (S&BR; and SCR) allied with it, achieving a through route from Birkenhead to Birmingham. The docks at Birkenhead, with the access to Liverpool, formed a key location at the time.T B Maund, The Birkenhead Railway (LMS and GW Joint), The Railway Correspondence and Travel Society, Sawtry, 2000, , pages 18 to 21Baughan, pages 40 to 42 Conflict with the LNWR The LNWR chairman, Mark Huish, was accustomed to aggressive business tactics, and prohibited the sale of tickets to Wolverhampton from Chester station, and had S&CR; and BL&CJR; publicity defaced, and banned omnibuses put on to by-pass the obstruction. The BL&CJR; board was intimidated by the LNWR action and at first submitted to the pressure; but in 1850 its shareholders protested at the loss of business, and co-operation with the S&CR; was resumed. (The shareholders had discovered that three times as much traffic was being received from the Shrewsbury line as from the LNWR.Beck, page 19 In January 1851 the S&BR; and the S&CR; formed a traffic agreement with the GWR. The LNWR retaliated with a series of extremely improper business practices, including the forging of a traffic agreement using a false company seal. The S&CR; obtained running powers over the whole of the Birkenhead line, enshrined in Act of Parliament, and the S&BR; and the S&CR; decided to merge with the GWR. At first this was refused by Parliament; the collaborative grouping continued nevertheless, and become known as ‚Äúthe Associated Companies‚Äù. Merging with the Great Western Railway The amalgamation with the GWR was again proposed, and it was approved on 1 September 1854; in the process the new (expanded) GWR acquired its first narrow (standard) gauge locomotives.MacDermot, page 390 The Birkenhead company saw what was inevitable and made a traffic agreement with the GWR, and goods traffic from Birkenhead started on 2 February 1856. A passenger service between Birmingham and Birkenhead started on 1 May 1857. In 1859 the LNWR and the GWR agreed to joint operation of the Birkenhead line, and full joint ownership followed on 20 November 1860, ratified by Act of Parliament in 1861. In August 1861 the GWR completed the laying of mixed gauge to Paddington, so that narrow gauge trains could run throughout from Birkenhead, and on 1 October 1861 the first narrow gauge through train ran. For some time the GWR did little to develop long distance passenger traffic; it had the handicap of the long route via Oxford, and of serving Liverpool from the Birkenhead side of the Mersey. Only from 1880 was a fast through train put on, known as the Northern Zulu. From this time the North and West route had trains from Cardiff and the West of England.Beck, pages 59 to 61 Goods traffic, more particularly mineral traffic, had long been a much more fruitful business; notwithstanding the existence of the North Wales Coalfield locally, there was a heavy traffic in coal from South Wales to the Wrexham area and Birkenhead for bunkering, and a corresponding southward traffic of iron ore to serve the ironworks of South Wales.Beck, pages 27 and 73Buaghan, pages 41 to 43 Passenger traffic developed from Birkenhead to GWR destinations, many of them outside London, as the LNWR service from Liverpool was superior. From the late 1890s through trains from Liverpool via the Mersey Railway were begun. In fact the dominant traffic was coal from South Wales to Birkenhead. Access to Minera improved The 1847 branch from Wheatsheaf Junction to Minera via Brymbo was difficult to work, having two rope-worked inclines. The Shrewsbury and Chester Railway promoted a new line, the Wrexham and Minera Railway, which obtained the Royal Assent on 17 May 1861. It ran by a more southerly route, from a junction south of Wrexham, at Croes Newydd to BrymboIt is sometimes asserted that the Wrexham and Minera Railway ran throughout between the points in its name. In fact the western extremity was at Brymbo, where it joined the 1847 Minera branch, which continued in use westward from there., and it opened on 22 May 1862. The Moss Incline, the rope-worked inclined plane immediately east of Moss on the original Minera branch line was closed.Baughan, page 51James I C Boyd, The Wrexham, Mold and Connah's Quay Railway, The Oakwood Press, Headington, 1991, pages 48 and 49 Wrexham, Mold and Connah's Quay Railway There was dissatisfaction among industrialists over railway connections out of the area. In time the Wrexham, Mold and Connah‚Äôs Quay Railway was authorised on 7 August 1862. It was built from Wrexham to join the Buckley Railway, a former horse tramway that had been upgraded, and together the two short lines gave access to a wharf on the River Dee, and to a connection with the Chester and Holyhead Railway. The line opened on 1 January 1866 for mineral traffic, and for passengers after improvements, on 1 May 1866.Boyd, page 95 onwards LNWR branches Since 1805 there had been a horse tramway from the canal at Pontcysyllte to Acrefair village, serving Kynaston colliery and iron works on the way, as well as quarries at Cefn. It was called the Ruabon Brook Tramway, owned by the canal company. It was leased to the London and North Western Railway in 1847, and in 1863 the LNWR converted the line to a locomotive railway, adding numerous short connections to pits and brickworks in the locality.James I C Boyd, The Wrexham, Mold and Connah's Quay Railway, The Oakwood Press, 1991, The LNWR had a branch line to Coed Poeth and Tryddyn. The Wrexham and Minera Extension Railway, from Brymbo to Tryddyn, was authorised in 1865, and the powers were transferred to the LNWR and GWR jointly, and opened in 1872.Baughan, pages 56 and 60Rex Christiansen, Forgotten Railways: North and Mid Wales, David St John Thomas, Newton Abbot, 1984, , pages 37, 39 and 41 Ponkey branch In 1861 the GWR opened a further branch: from a junction just north of Ruabon station to furnaces at Ponciau (Ponkey) and Aberderfyn, opening on 1 August 1861, and on 27 August 1871 it was extended to Legacy. Moss Valley branch The GWR opened a Moss Valley Branch of 3 miles, authorised on 21 July 1873 and opened on 11 May 1881; it ran to Ffrwd Ironworks from a junction with the W&MR; main line near its origin.Baughan, pages 55 and 56 Passenger operation on the Brymbo lines On the GWR line from Brymbo to Minera, passenger trains started operating as far as Coed Poeth on 15 November 1897, and the passenger service was extended to Berwig in 1905. From this time the motor-train system favoured by the GWR was used: a single coach incorporated a small steam engine; the arrangement was economical on lightly used passenger services, and a number of motor halts were opened to take advantage of the system. The Moss Valley branch received a similar passenger service from 1 May 1905, running from Wrexham as far up the valley as Moss Platform.Baughan, page 61 and 62 Branch line extensions at Legacy The GWR later obtained authorisation to construct a branch line (the ‚ÄúRhos‚Äù branch) from near Wrexham to Legacy, making new connections there with the Ponkey branch and the Plas Madoc branch. This new group of branches opened on 1 October 1901. Railmotors once again enabled a passenger service on local routes where patronage might not be heavy; from 1 May 1905 a passenger service ran on the Pontcysyllte branch, and from 5 June 1905 southwards from Legacy on the Ponkey branch.Christiansen, page 43 Wrexham station improvements The open cast working to the west of the coalfield declined as the pits became worked out, and increasingly at the end of the nineteenth century the focus was on underground working further east. Wrexham became the centre of railway activity as man branches led there, and the passenger facilities at Wrexham General station were substantially improved in the period 1909 ‚Äì 1912.Baughan, pages 44 and 45 Passenger train services In July 1938 there were expresses from London to Birkenhead at 09:10, 11:05, 14:10, 16:05 and 18:10, with some summer Saturday extras. Most of these trains advertised connections for the Isle of Man or Belfast, as well as Liverpool Landing Stage. Travel by the morning train occupied 5 hours and 7 minutes to Liverpool Landing Stage. Most of the expresses stopped at Shrewsbury, Gobowen, Ruabon, Wrexham and Chester, and there were some trains from the south coast conveying through coaches from multiple destinations. The local service was fairly limited; taking Rednal as an example, there were seven weekday down trains calling, and most of the local trains did not run right through from Shrewsbury to Chester.Bradshaw's 1938 Railway Guide, David and Charles Reprints, 1969, The general pattern had been similar in 1910, but the journey time was slower (6 hours 40 minutes London to Liverpool) and the last train was earlier, at 16:55.Bradshaw's April 1910 Railway Guide, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1968, In 1960 there were express trains from London to Birkenhead at about two-hourly intervals, as well as a night train conveying a sleeping car. Most of the trains made connections to and from Oswestry at Gobowen. The local station service was very limited; for example Stanwardine Halt had three calls a day by down trains.British Railway, Passenger Services, that is Public Timetable, Western Region, summer 1960 Service reductions Retrenchment in World War I resulted in the railmotor halts closing, as well as severance of the Ponkey to Legacy connection. Wrexham to Rhos passenger trains continued running until 30 December 1930. The line between Pontcysyllte and Pant closed in 1953, and between Pant and Rhos on 14 October 1963. Competition from road services for local transport after World War II resulted in a steep decline in passenger and goods business at intermediate stations, and most of those were closed on 10 September 1962.Baughan, pages 62 and 63 When the electrification of the former LNWR London to Birmingham route was complete in March 1967, through trains from Paddington were discontinued, from 4 March 1967.Baughan, page 45 The Gobowen to Oswestry line passenger service was discontinued on 7 November 1966; it was singled on 2 November 1971 with occasional freight operation, until 28 October 1988.Baughan, page 170 The original main line from Saltney Junction (Chester) to Shrewsbury remains active, with passenger stations open at Wrexham General, Ruabon, Chirk and Gobowen.

Little Matlock Rolling Mill also known as Low Matlock Rolling Mill is a Grade II* Listed building situated on the River Loxley in the village of Loxley on the outskirts of the City of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England. The building continues to operate as a rolling mill, owned and operated by Pro-Roll Ltd, a specialist hand rolling company. A brick building extension was added to the original 1882 structure in 1939.Pro-Roll Ltd Gives details company. History The original mill dated from 1732 when James Balguy of Stannington leased land from the Duke of Norfolk to build a cutlers wheel on the site. Balguy operated the wheel until 1743 when Tobias Andrews took over. The rental records show numerous names as tenants in the ensuing years with the more long standing being the Hawley family, James Colley, J.W. Armitage and J. Shaw. Arnold Wilde was the occupant in 1801 and by 1806 he had purchased the mill outright. In the early part of the 19th century the mill consisted of three workshops with two overshot water wheels which drove two pairs of tilt hammers, two forge hammers and a plating hammer.\\"Water Power on the Sheffield Rivers\\", David Crossley (Editor), , Page 36 Gives history and details of building. Great Sheffield Flood The hamlet of Little Matlock was severely damaged by the Great Sheffield Flood of March 1864, it was accentuated by the fact that the River Loxley is quite narrow at that point as it squeezes between steep valley sides. There was no damage to dwellings as they were situated on higher ground away from the flood but the industrial wheels and tilts by the river were either completely destroyed or severely damaged. Two young men were killed at Mr. Thomas Harrison‚Äôs Tilt and Forge. Mr Cadman the owner of Little Matlock Forge claimed over ¬£5,000 in compensation after the flood for damage to tilts, forges, dam banking, weir and cottages.A Complete History of the Great Flood at Sheffield by Samuel Harrison (Google Books - search on Little Matlock) Gives details of flood damage to Little Matlock. The present day structure was built in 1882 on the foundations of the old buildings being constructed from squared gritstone with a slate roof. The building re-opened as a rolling mill being driven by a single overshot water wheel. The mill remained water driven until 1956 when it was converted to electricity under the ownership of Kenyon Brothers and Co, Ltd. In 1974 the mill was sold to Barworth Flockton Ltd and then in 1997 it was taken over by Firth Rixson Ltd, who worked the rolling mill for two years. Grace's Industrial History Guide When operations ceased in 1999, the whole site was sold to a development company who had intended to convert all the buildings to residential properties. The mill's houses, the mill dam, water courses and water wheel were sold off as separate lots, however intervention from Sheffield City Council prevented the main mill buildings from being turned into housing, instead requiring that they retain their original purpose as a rolling mill. Pro-Roll Ltd bought the mill buildings and yard in 2001, re-opening the Little Matlock site as a traditional hand-rolling mill later that year. Water wheel The overshot water wheel is immobile and has not been used since 1956, it is now off its bearings and covered in vegetation and in need of renovation, it is the largest wheel of its type to survive in Sheffield. It has a diameter of 18ft 6in and a width of 11ft 8in with 8 cast- iron spokes to each side and 42 buckets. Above the wheel is a cast iron penstock now permanently closed. In the 1950s it was estimated that the wheel could generate 25 horse power using Volumetric flow rate data. Behind the wheel are a dam and mill race constructed to drive the wheel.

Shadowstats primarily focuses on inflation, but also keeps track of the money supply, unemployment and GDP by utilizing methodologies abandoned by previous administrations from the Clinton era to the Great Depression.

Williams, who holds a BA in Economics and an MBA from Dartmouth College.Shadowstats main page: \\"Walter J. \\"John\\" Williams was born in 1949.

During his career as a consulting economist... He is popularly known as \\"John Williams.\\"  Claims  Shadowstats is perhaps best known for its alternative inflation statistics. Williams says that major changes to the Consumer Price Index were made between 1997‚Äì1999 in an effort to reduce Social Security outlays, using controversial changes by Alan Greenspan that include \\"hedonic regression\\", or the increased quality of goods. Some other investors have echoed Williams' views, most prominently Bill Gross, who reportedly called the US CPI an \\"haute con job\\".\\"Indeed, over the past few years, some of Mr Williams's views on economic indicators - the consumer price index, in particular - have been echoed by better-known and leading investment community figures, such as the bond investor Bill Gross, the strategist Stephen Roach and James Grant.\\" John S.

McClelland: Addressing misconceptions about the Consumer Price Index, Monthly Labor Review, August 2008 Williams points out that under President Lyndon B. Johnson, the U-3 unemployment rate series was created, which excludes people who stopped looking for work for more than a year ago as well as part-time workers who are seeking full-time employment. Although the old unemployment rate series', which include part-time workers looking for full-time work and unemployed who stopped looking over a year ago, is still published monthly by BLS, the U-3 series is generally considered more meaningful and is the headline rate picked up by most media outlets.Alternative measures of labor underutilization, BLS. Williams calculates the U-6 rate as it was calculated until December 1993. Shadowstats also tracks alternative growth statistics, Williams reports that the official numbers for U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and jobs growth range from \\"deceptive\\" to \\"rigged\\" and \\"manipulated\\".

University of Maryland Professor Katharine Abraham, who previously headed the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the agency responsible for publishing official unemployment and inflation data, says of Williams' claims about data manipulation that \\"[t]he culture of the Bureau of Labor Statistics is so strong that it's not going to happen.\\" Steve Landefeld, former director of the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Commerce Department agency that prepares quarterly GDP reports, said in response to an article about Williams, \\"the bureau rigorously follows guidelines designed to ensure its work remains totally transparent and absolutely unbiased.\\" In the same article, UC San Diego economist Valerie Ramey, a member of the Federal Economic Statistics Advisory Committee, defended the methodological changes, claiming they were only made \\"after academic economists did decades of research and said they should be done.\\" Others find these alternatives to be \\"implausibly high\\" in spite of potential errors in the official data, especially when cross checked with data on nominal interest rates and physical output. Shadowstats measure of inflation has also been unfavorably compared with alternative private measures such as the Billions Prices Project which tracks millions of online retail prices from around the world in real time. In addition, despite claims of much higher inflation than official reports suggest, and even potential hyperinflation in the future, Shadowstats has not changed its $175 per year subscription fee since at least 2006, leading some to question its validity. Responding to prior criticisms made by economist James Hamilton, John Williams explained in a private phone call that Shadowstats does not actually recalculate BLS data, rather, the Shadowstats CPI merely adds a constant to the officially reported numbers.

BTUM was initially funded by private donors and government subsidies, and it grew with the help of professionals in the field of translation over the following years.Gagnon 1994, p. 509 In 1975, the BTUM was able to obtain data and user responses in collaboration with the language services of Bell Canada.Gagnon 1994, p. 509 At the end of 1974, however, the Translation Bureau under the Canadian Secretary of State Department showed interest in the operation of BTUM.Dupont 1989, p. 594 The goal of the Translation Bureau at the time was to standardize terminology throughout the public service, as well as the federal public administration.Adshead 1987, p. 235 In January 1976, the Canadian Secretary of State Department officially acquired BTUM, and renamed the database TERMIUM (TERMInologie Universit√© de Montr√©al).Gagnon 1994, p. 509 The system was then transferred to the central computer of the federal government in Ottawa, and began to integrate approximately 175,000 files that the BTUM initially compiled with the files that the Translation Bureau had been working on.Gagnon 1994, p. 509 In the years to follow, the bureau began the sorting process, along with the input process onto the computer. The database grew to 900,000 records by 1987.Gagnon 1994, p. 509  Development  As terminological records grew in the TERMIUM database, the Canadian government received a proposal, in 1985, from a Toronto-based company to launch TERMIUM in a CD-ROM format, in order to make the database more accessible to users.Dupont 1989, p. 595 By fall of 1987, a pilot project for CD-ROM was launched to investigate the responses from its users, which included services under the Translation Bureau and other private Canadian companies.Dupont 1989, p. 595 After some data compilation and investigation, the bureau incorporated an indexing system to improve the speed and accuracy of term extraction. By 1990, TERMIUM on CD- ROM was commercially available through subscription (with an annual fee of $1,100 to $1,500).Gagnon 1994, p. 512 Updates were released every three to four months.Gagnon 1994, p. 512 In 1996, TERMIUM on CD-ROM received an award from ATIO (The Association of Translators and Interpreters of Ontario). In October 2009, TERMIUM Plus and an array of language tools under the Language Portal of Canada were launched with free online access.  Features  TERMIUM was initially developed to contain terminological records in both of Canada‚Äôs official languages (English and French).Gagnon 1994, p. 510 As the system upgraded to its third-generation version in 1985, it contained records in other languages such as Spanish, in order to accommodate its growing range of users.Andersen 1987, p. 111 It is worth noting, however, that in these ‚Äúmultilingual‚Äù records, the term in the source language would be in English or French, with its equivalent in a non-official language.Adshead 1987, p. 237 Currently, there is a vast collection of specialized domains and fields covered by TERMIUM Plus, ranging from administration (including appellations), arts, sciences to law and justice. Aside from the millions of entries recorded by TERMIUM Plus, the database also contains writing tools for both the English and French language (such as The Canadian Style, a writing style guide; and Dictionnaire des cooccurrences, a guide to French collocations), archived glossaries, as well as a link to the Language Portal of Canada (containing various French and English writing resources).

Early life  Green was born on 19 July 1911 in Whitechapel, London. His father was Philip Green, a boot clicker, and his mother was Elizabeth Vogel. Career Green's first credited work was on 1943's The Sky's the Limit. He was a house arranger and conductor for Decca and accompanied many of their vocalists such as Gracie Fields, Donald Peers and Anne Shelton. He was later appointed resident musical director of the Rank Organisation.David Ades, Biography at the Robert Farnon Society, accessed 20 November 2010 He continued to compose and conduct for film and television until his retirement in 1966. Philip, along with his wife, Dorothy, established the Philip and Dorothy Green Music Trust to help young musicians and composers. Works He composed more than 150 film scores including The Yellow Balloon (1952), Carry on Admiral (1957), The Square Peg (1958, together with several other Norman Wisdom films), The League of Gentlemen (1960), Victim (1961), The Singer Not the Song (1961), and The Intelligence Men (1965). His themes for John and Julie (1954) and The March Hare (1956) both won Ivor Novello Awards. He also composed the themes for the popular 1960s television crime series Ghost Squad and Sergeant Cork. Like many composers of film music and light music, he also wrote prolifically for production music libraries and as a result, a number of his compositions are familiar through their use in film, radio and television programmes. Many of these works are now published by Carlin Production Music. His short composition \\"Horse Feathers\\" was used for the radio series Meet the Huggetts,David Ades, Notes to The Great British Light Experience (EMI, 1997), p.9 for example, and a number of his pieces were used in Night of the Living Dead, Looney Tunes theatrical shorts (such as in 1958 when the musicians were on strike, or later added as part of TV prints for Freudy Cat.) Death He died in 1982 of cerebral metastasis. After his death, his stock music could again be heard in The Ren and Stimpy Show, The World's Greatest Magic and SpongeBob SquarePants.

This season marked a major change in the series; it takes place at a different location and only three of the seven main characters from the first eight seasons remained as regular main characters. The rest of the cast is made up of new recruits, including Lucy, played by Kerry Bish√©, who is also the show's new narrator. Former star Zach Braff returned for six episodes of the season. The new season focuses on students at a med school at the fictional Winston University, rather than interns at a hospital. Doctors Perry Cox and Christopher Turk, played by John C. McGinley and Donald Faison respectively, returned as teachers. The show's filming location moved from the North Hollywood Medical Center to sets at Culver Studios. The series takes place at the new Sacred Heart Hospital, located on the Winston University campus. The season takes place over a year after the events of the last episode of the eighth season, \\"My Finale\\", which was expected to be the last episode and ended many of the series' long-running storylines. However, Bill Lawrence was approached concerning more episodes, and as a result, the show entered its ninth season. Review aggregator Metacritic found critical reception to the new format to be \\"generally positive\\" and assigned an average score of 64/100, though reviews were varied, with the Chicago Sun Times calling the season \\"promising\\", but USA Today dismissing it as a \\"deal-driven mistake\\". The season nonetheless saw Scrubs receive its lowest-ever ratings, with an average of 3.79 million tuning in, down from 5.61 million the previous season (though the show's overall ranking had improved). Zach Braff announced on March 22, 2010 via Facebook that it appeared that Scrubs would not be renewed for a tenth season, and on May 14, 2010, ABC officially cancelled the series. Background The eighth season was expected to be the last for Scrubs, but in May 2009, ABC announced that the series had been renewed for an additional 13 episodes. John C. McGinley and Donald Faison signed one-year deals and were the only cast members to stay on as regulars. Zach Braff appeared in six episodes to assist in transitioning the show, while Sarah Chalke signed on to guest star in four episodes throughout the season. Ken Jenkins appeared in nine episodes, and Neil Flynn, who was also busy with his new show The Middle, appeared in a single scene in the season's first episode. Judy Reyes was the only original cast member to not return, after declining to appear in a recurring guest role as she only wanted to return full-time. Eliza Coupe, who portrayed Denise Mahoney beginning in season eight, became a series regular, along with new cast members Kerry Bish√©, Michael Mosley and Dave Franco. Lawrence considered the eighth season to be the end of the show Scrubs, going so far as to ask ABC if he could change the name to Scrubs Med. ABC declined, but Lawrence still advised fans to treat it as a new show, even putting a caption under the \\"Created By\\" on the X-ray in the opening sequence saying [Med School].

The setting shifted from the original hospital building to a new Sacred Heart medical school and university campus, with shooting locations moving to Culver Studios. Executive producers Neil Goldman and Garrett Donovan, and Bill Callahan departed from the series and were replaced by Jonathan Groff, Zach Braff, and Josh Bycel, who also served as the co-showrunner, alongside creator/executive producer Bill Lawrence who was doing double duty at the time with both Scrubs and his new show Cougar Town. Every writer from previous seasons departed from the show with the exception of Lawrence and Andy Schwartz.

In its early days the line carried passengers and freight. The growth in the number of motor cars and buses led to reducing passenger traffic in the 1920s and passenger services ceased on the line in 1930. Freight traffic continued to run until passenger services were restored in 1941, as villages such as Yealmpton were then being used as dormitory areas by the people of Plymouth following the severe air raids on the city.

A rectangle that is one furlong (i.e., 10 chains, or 40 rods) in length and one rod in width is one rood in area, as is any space comprising 40 perches (a perch being one square rod).

The present duc d'Uz√®s and duc de Luynes descend from him. Family and childhood Louis C√©sar was the son of Charles Fran√ßois de La Baume Le Blanc, marquis and then duc de La Valli√®re, and his wife, Marie Th√©r√®se de Noailles, a daughter of Anne Jules de Noailles, duc de Noailles. His father was a nephew of Louise de La Valli√®re, the first official mistress of King Louis XIV of France. On his father's side of the family, Louis C√©sar's relatives at court included Louise de La Valli√®re's daughter by Louis XIV, Marie Anne de Bourbon, princesse de Conti. On his mother's side, his aunt was Marie Victoire de Noailles, the wife of Louis Alexandre de Bourbon, comte de Toulouse, and mother of Louis Jean Marie de Bourbon, duc de Penthi√®vre, the wealthiest man in France during Louis C√©sar's lifetime. His uncle, Adrien Maurice de Noailles, married Fran√ßoise Charlotte d'Aubign√©, the niece of Madame de Maintenon. Another cousin was Louis de Pardaillan de Gondrin, duc d'Antin, a great-grandson of Madame de Montespan. When Louise de La Valli√®re left Versailles for a religious life after her displacement in the king's affections by Madame de Montespan, she gave the duchies of Vaujours and La Valli√®re to her daughter, the princesse de Conti. The princess sold them in 1698 to Louis C√©sar's father. From his birth, Louis C√©sar was known at court as the marquis de La Valli√®re. His father retained the Vaujours title for himself until his own death in 1739. In 1727 at the early age of nineteen, Louis C√©sar was promoted to the rank of colonel of the regiment under the title of duc de La Valli√®re. In 1730, his father also gave him the duchy of Vaujours. With this new title came the rank of pair de France. Even though his father officially gave up the duchy in 1732, he was still styled at court as the duc de Vaujours. Adulthood In 1732, Louis C√©sar married Jeanne Julie Fran√ßoise de Crussol d'Uz√®s, the daughter of Charles Emmanuel de Crussol (1743‚Äì1815) and his wife, Emilie de La Rochefoucauld. His wife was a member of the House of Crussol, the most important peers in France after that of the Princes of the Blood. Upon his father's death in 1739, Louis C√©sar became the new duc de La Valli√®re and was made the governor of Bourbonnais. In addition, he inherited the Ch√¢teau de Champs-sur-Marne. Around 1750, he added a beautiful rococo salon chinois (Chinese salon) to the ch√¢teau with wall paintings by noted artist Christophe Huet. The property had been given to his father by his cousin, the princesse de Conti, in 1718 in order to settle some debts. At the ch√¢teau, Louis C√©sar entertained many of the famous writers of the day, including Diderot, Voltaire, d'Alembert and Fran√ßois-Augustin de Paradis de Moncrif, with whom he also corresponded regularly. Catalogue of the first part of the sale of his library, 1783 Monsieur de La Valli√®re was also created the Captain of the Hunt by Louis XV of France as well as the Grand Falconer of France in 1748. King Louis XV respected him, and Louis C√©sar became close with the king's mistress, the famous Madame de Pompadour, who named him the master of her private theatre. In 1749 the king bestowed upon him the Order of the Holy Spirit in a ceremony which took place at the Palace of Versailles on 25 May. The order was the most prestigious in France. After the construction of a magnificent new ch√¢teau at Montrouge around 1750, the duke gradually abandoned the Ch√¢teau de Champs-sur-Marne. Eventually, he tried to sell the estate, but he could not find a buyer and was forced to rent it out. Between July 1757 and January 1759, he leased the estate to Madame de Pompadour for 12,000 livres per year. The marquise spent 200,000 livres in less than eighteen months to renovate the ch√¢teau. In November 1757, she received the prince de Soubise there after his defeat at the Battle of Rossbach. As the king did not like the ch√¢teau, the marquise left it at the beginning of 1759. In 1763, the duke finally sold Champs to Gabriel Michel de Tharon (1702‚Äì1765), a rich shipowner. Louis C√©sar was one of the greatest bibliophiles of his time. With the assistance of his librarian, the abb√© Rive, he bought entire libraries and sold whatever he already had. His great library was eventually sold in three stages, first in 1767; then in 1783 and again in 1788. Part of the famous collection was acquired by the comte d'Artois, brother of Louis XVI and future king of France. That part of the library was incorporated into the Biblioth√®que de l'Arsenal in Paris. The duke's library was famous: {align=center width=90% padding=10px text-align=justify cellspacing=10px width=50% align=justify valign=top Monsieur le duc de La Valli√®re has just died. He was one of those lords who was the most corrupt of the old court, friend of the late king and all his mistresses. He did merit the conservation of his name to posterity of a distinguished author, collector of letters and even their maker. He had sold his very renowned library for his manuscripts. He had been composed of another genre, very precious indeed ; he had paintings and, a modern Lucullus, he possessed beautiful gardens, like the Roman width=50% align=justify valign=top cellspacing=30px M. le duc de La Valli√®re vient de mourir.

Il avait vendu une fois sa biblioth√®que tr√®s renomm√©e alors pour les manuscrits. Il s'en √©tait compos√© une autre d'un nouveau genre, fort pr√©cieuse encore ; il avait des tableaux et, moderne Lucullus, il poss√©dait des jardins d√©licieux, comme ce Romain } The duke also wrote two books: Ballets, opera, et autres ouvrages lyriques (1760) and the Biblioth√®que du Th√©√¢tre-Fran√ßais (1768, 3 vol. in-12). The latter was edited by Barth√©lemy Mercier de Saint- L√©ger. Issue Louis C√©sar and his wife, Jeanne Julie Fran√ßoise de Crussol d'Uz√®s, had only one child, a daughter. As the duchy of La Valli√®re had previously been held by several women, including Louise de La Valli√®re and her daughter, the princesse de Conti, his daughter was able to inherit the title. On her death, however, the title became extinct. *Adrienne Emilie F√©licit√© de La Baume Le Blanc La Baume-Le Blanc ducs de La Valli√®re (29 September 1740 ‚Äì 15 May 1812), duchesse de Ch√¢tillon et de La Valli√®re, dame de Wideville, married 4 April 1756 to Louis Gaucher, duc de Ch√¢tillon, and had issue.

Biography William Barlum Thompson was born on March 10, 1860 in Detroit, the son of Thomas and Bridget Barlum Thompson. He graduated from the public schools of the city, and in 1876 from Goldsmith's Business University, located in Detroit. He went into the meat-market business with his uncle Thomas Barlum, became a partner with Barlum in 1880, and set off on his own in 1882. In 1887 he married Nellie Hymes; the couple had nine children: Mary (born 1888), Kathleen (1889), Irene (1891), William Grover (1892), Francis Leo (1895), Helen M. (1897), Edna L. (1899), Edith R. (1905), and Virginia M. (1909). Politics William Barlum Thompson was a Democrat, and served as an alderman for two terms, from 1891-1894, but declined to run for a third term. However, by popular demand, he ran again in 1896 and was re-elected. In 1897, he was elected city treasurer and resigned his seat as an alderman. He served as treasurer for nine years. He was elected mayor twice, serving in 1907-1908 and again in 1911-1912. Later life Thompson went into partnership with his cousin John J. Barlum, forming the Cadillac Square Improvement Company. The company constructed a number of buildings around Cadillac Square, including the Barlum Tower (now Cadillac Tower), the Barlum Hotel (now New Cadillac Square Apartments), and the Lawyers Building.

From top to bottom are a hook, a cage, the switch and a handle in one molding A trouble light, also known as a rough service light, drop light, or inspection lamp, is a special lamp used to illuminate obscure places and able to handle moderate abuse. The light bulb is housed in a protective cage and a handle that are molded to form a single unit. It has a long power line for distant reaching; the handle may also have electrical outlet on it, allowing the light to also double as an extension cord. Trouble lights are usually powered by AC wall current, but some are powered by a 12-volt source, such as a car battery. The bulb of the trouble light typically has a heavy filament to withstand dropping, and therefore is also referred to as a drop light.http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4275435.html Newer models often use LED arrays as the light source. LEDs are more energy efficient, and may be more durable as well, compared to incandescents. Some trouble lights are also designed to operate on 32 VAC supplied from either a local or centralised transformer, the local one being a plug pack or inline style transformer, and the centralised transformer usually being mounted near the building switchboard and distributed to various special 32 V outlets in work areas to power multiple lights. This is to maximise electrical safety especially in wet environments or where the cord may be damaged during use and otherwise pose a shock hazard. This was common in Australian mechanical workshops before the advent of battery powered worklights, with the 32 V socket being a non polarised Type A socket or polarised \\"T\\" socket to differentiate the 32 V transformer supply from the normal Aus/NZ 240 V mains supply sockets which are Type I. Trouble lights are intended to be used with \\"rough service bulbs\\", a form of incandescent light bulbs which are designed with as many as five support wires holding the filament to allow it to withstand heavy vibrations or movement. Lower voltage bulbs such as those intended to function with 12 volt power supplies also have a higher lumen output per watt of power consumption. Compact fluorescent lamps and recently, light-emitting diodes may also be used in trouble lights. Trouble lights intended for use in hazardous areas such as in petrochemical plants will have features designed to prevent ignition of flammable gas around the lamp, such as heavy sealed lamp enclosures and guards to protect lamps from breaking. Applications Trouble lights are often used by automotive mechanics and electricians where localized light is needed where ambient light proves to be insufficient.

It is a tributary of the river Jal√≥n. The waters have a high concentration of calcium carbonate which is deposited on plant life near the source, giving the river its name R√≠o Piedra, which means 'stone river' in English. The population of the endangered European freshwater crayfish in the river and its tributaries has practically disappeared owing to the introduction of the North American signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus).R√≠o Piedra, Entorno Natural en la Provincia de Zaragoza Geography It rises near Campillo de Due√±as, in the province of Guadalajara, Castile-La Mancha. The Piedra has an irregular flow, due to the long dry season of the summer months, with often heavy rainfall in the spring and autumn. The mean discharge at Monasterio de Piedra is . The river is often said to rise at Cimballa, in the province of Zaragoza, but it actually rises near Campillo de Due√±as, although the upper reaches are often dry in the summer months. Springs at Campillo amplify the flow, so that it always has water below this point. From Cimballa, the Piedra flows down to the water gardens of the Monasterio de Piedra where the calcareous water has formed a Karst topography of waterfalls and rocky pools. The place is popular with visitors, for it is a kind of oasis in the surrounding arid and harsh mountainous landscape. After leaving the Monasterio the river descends to La Tranquera Dam at Nu√©valos. The rivers Mesa, Ortiz and Munebraga also feed the reservoir and may be considered tributaries of the Piedra. From La Tranquera, the river flows past Carenas and joins the Jal√≥n near Castej√≥n de las Armas and Ateca.

The association is a non-profit, member-supported organization that primarily advocates for world-class 220-mph high-speed trains linking major cities and supports fast, frequent and dependable trains on other routes that connect with 220-mph corridors to form a modern national rail network. The High Speed Rail Alliance's executive director, Richard Harnish, believes it is time for America to ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù with European and Asian countries in terms of using high-speed rail systems. The Association is an active member of fourbillion.com, a coalition of advocacy organizations that worked to secure a $4 billion appropriation in 2010 for high-speed rail in the U.S. The effort began after the US House of Representatives passed a bill that included $4 billion for high-speed rail. The Senate cut the allocation down to $1.2 billion in their version. The two bills were in a conference committee. In June 2009, The High Speed Rail Alliance released a transportation engineering study of a 220-mph rail corridor in the Midwest. The 220-mph high-speed link would cut the trip from Chicago to St. Louis to 1 hour and 52 minutes and also serve O'Hare International Airport as well as key Illinois business, university and government centers in Kankakee, Champaign, Decatur, Springfield and Edwardsville. The line would cost between 12 billion and 13 billion dollars. The HSRA views the Chicago-St. Louis link as the first of a regional 220-mph high-speed rail network that would link Chicago, St. Louis, the Twin Cities, Milwaukee, Detroit, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus and Pittsburgh, putting more than 35 million people within a three-hour train ride of Chicago. In a proposal to the U.S. Department of Transportation, SNCF, operator of the TGV high-speed rail network in France, estimated that a Midwestern 220-mph high-speed rail network would create 677,000 permanent jobs and 316,000 construction jobs. Automobile trips would be reduced by 4.3 billion vehicle miles each year, saving 3 million barrels of oil each year, and additionally reduce CO2 and other pollutant emissions by 1.4 million tons in 2030. The total estimated cost for the network is $68.5 billion.SNCF proposal for development of Midwest High Speed Rail Corridor Advocates for high-speed rail put that cost in perspective by pointing out that the Interstate Highway System cost 450 billion in 2008 dollars. The High Speed Rail Alliance has been a vocal critic of libertarian and conservative activists who view HSRA as distorting the record and facts on high-speed rail. In July 2009, it released a document responding to statements by the Cato Institute and the Reason Foundation about high-speed rail.

Produced by Chicago's Annoyance Theater, the show opened September 26, 2009 and closed October 31, 2009 and was directed by Ray Mees, with music written by Chuck Malone.  Plot  The plot of the show mirrors that of the film, with only a few minor adjustments. Still set in the late 1950s, with the theater set up to be a part of the \\"Yellow Door Cafe\\" with much of the action taking place at tables set in the middle of the audience.  Act 1  The show opens with the latest poem of Maxwell H. Brock, after which the cast arrives on stage inviting the \\"squares\\" into this world, and introducing many of the lead players (\\"The Bucket of Blood\\"). After hearing the poem and taking abuse from the regulars and his boss Leonard (\\"Walter, You're a Busboy\\"), socially awkward busboy Walter Paisley returns home to attempt to create a sculpture of the face of the hostess Carla, whom he has a crush on (\\"I Know That I'm An Artist\\"). Despite his best efforts, his sculpture fails. He stops when he hears the meowing of Frankie, the cat owned by his inquisitive landlady Mrs. Surchart, who has somehow gotten himself stuck in Walter's wall. Walter attempts to get Frankie out using a knife, but accidentally kills the cat when he sticks the knife into his wall. Disgusted with himself, Walter cries himself to sleep and has a maniacal dream sequence in which he remembers the torments of the day and ends with the poetry of Brock pour through his tormented mind, giving him a radical inspiration. Instead of giving Frankie a proper burial, Walter covers the cat in clay, leaving the knife stuck in it. (\\"Busboy Reprise\\") Next morning, Walter shows the cat to Carla and Leonard. Leonard dismisses the oddly morbid piece but Carla enthuses about the work, which is then displayed in the caf√©. Walter gets newfound respect from the beatniks and poets who hang out in the caf√© (\\"Dead Cat Rag\\"). An adoring fan, Naolia, gives him a vial of heroin to remember her by (\\"Naolia's Song\\"). Naively ignorant of its function, he takes it home while Lou Raby, an undercover cop, follows him. Meanwhile, Leonard discovers the secret behind Walter's \\"Dead Cat\\" piece. He decides to keep the secret when an art collector approaches him and offers $500 for \\"Dead Cat.\\" Back at Walter's Apartment, Lou attempts to take Walter into custody for narcotics possession. In a blind panic, Walter smashes his frying pan into Lou's head, killing him. The fracas alerts his landlady, and Walter fast talks her out of the apartment as he tries to hide the body (\\"Walter, Repetition is Death\\").  Act 2  Act 2 opens with the ensemble number \\"Walter Save Me\\" Next morning, both Leonard and Carla come with Walter as he unveils his latest work and are simultaneously amazed and appalled. Carla critiques it as \\"hideous and eloquent\\" and deserving of a public exhibition. Leonard, aghast at the idea, and downing a glass of scotch, realizes the potential for wealth if he plays this right. He and Carla quarrel over giving Walter a show, a prospect that delights the simpleton, especially as Leonard gives him a paltry cash advance to keep quiet. The next night, Walter is treated like a king by pretty much everyone, except for Alice, who has been out of town. Despite being pinup gorgeous, she is obnoxious and disliked. As Brock explains that a great artist is in their midst, Alice mocks Walter until he leaves in a huff. (\\"And Nobody Would Care if You Died\\") Walter later follows her home; she slams the door in his face. Despite his anger, he persists, explaining that he wants her model and is willing to pay her price. At Walter's apartment, Alice strips nude off camera, and poses in a chair. Walter suggests she put back on her scarf and, in a pretense of adjusting it to look right, uses it to strangle her. The latest work is brought to Brock's house, where the gang is gathered for a sumptuous organic breakfast (\\"Beatnik Breakfast Party\\"). Once unveiled, the statue of Alice renders them awestruck and Carla is so pleased that she kisses Walter.Brock is so impressed, he throws a party at the Yellow Door in Walter's honor. Costumed as a carnival fool, Walter is wined and dined to excess. Leonard keeps an eye on him, worried that he will make some mistake that will blow this deal. Brock composes a poem especially for Walter that provides him more twisted inspiration. (\\"What Am I Gonna Do Next?\\") Walter later stumbles back home, realizing he has to make good on his promise to make more work. Still drunk and with his rage unleashed, he murders an Ice Cream man by freezing his head with his own ice cream cart to create a bust. (\\"Ice Cream Waltz\\") When he shows it to Leonard, with the word of a horrible decapitation in the neighborhood fresh off the press, his boss realizes he has to stop Walter's murderous rampage. He promises Walter his show to offload these \\"statues,\\" at an exhibit of Walter's works. (\\"Leonard's Tango\\"). Before the show, Walter proproposes to Carla, who rejects him.(\\"Never Knew That You Loved Me\\") Walter is distraught and now offers to sculpt her, and she happily agrees to after the reception. Back at the exhibit, however, she finds part of the clay on one figure has worn away, revealing a human finger. When she tells Walter that there's a body in one of the sculptures, he tells her that he \\"made them immortal,\\" and that he can make her immortal too. She flees the exhibit, and he chases after her. Meanwhile, the others at the exhibit learn Walter's secret as well, and chase after them. Walter and Carla wind up at a lumber yard where Walter, haunted by the statues and voices of Lou, Alice, and the nameless ice cream man, stops chasing after Carla, and runs home. With discovery and retribution closing in on him, Walter then vows to 'hide where they'll never find me.' The art critics, Carla, Leonard and Maxwell break down Walter's apartment door only to find that Walter has hanged himself. Looking askance at the hanging corpse, Maxwell proclaims that this could be 'his greatest work'! (\\"Bucket of Blood Reprise\\") The character of Alice appears much earlier in the story to explain her later appearance and death. Instead of sawing the head off of a wood worker, Walter now freezes the head of an ice cream man. Leonard is never without a scotch, drinking it to excess when Walter's murders begin adding to his stress.  Cast  The cast consisted of several Annoyance Theater regulars, as well as a few newcomers to the Annoyance Stage. Due to the small cast, several cast members doubled on smaller roles. James Stanton... Walter Paisley Sam Locke... Leonard Peter Robards... Maxwell Jen Spyra... Carla Colleen Breen... Naolia/Ms. Swickert/Art Dealer Maari Suorsa... Alice Tyler Patocka... William/Art Dealer Peter Kremidas... Lee/Ice Cream Man  Reception  The show was well received by Chicago critics, including the Chicago Reader and the Loyola Phoenix. The Annoyance billed the show as part of a Halloween double feature with the theater's classic, long running blood show Splatter Theatre.

The island's indigenous people performed rituals known as are√≠to, which included dancing, although little information is known about such ceremonies. After the colonization of Cuba by the Spanish Kingdom, European dance forms were introduced such as the French contredanse, which gave rise to the Cuban contradanza. Contradanza itself spawned a series of ballroom dances between the 19th and 20th centuries, including the danz√≥n, mambo and cha-cha-cha. Rural dances of European origin, such as the zapateo and styles associated with punto guajiro also became established by the 19th century, and in the 20th century son became very popular. In addition, numerous dance traditions were brought by black slaves from West Africa and the Congo basin, giving rise to religious dances such as Santer√≠a, yuka and abaku√°, as well as secular forms such as rumba. Many of these dance elements from European dance and religious dances were fused together to form the basis of la t√©cnica cubana. Cuban music also contributed to the emergence of Latin dance styles in the United States, namely rhumba (ballroom rumba) and salsa. Dance styles Danz√≥n Danz√≥n is the official musical genre and dance of Cuba.Urf√©, Odilio 1965. El danz√≥n. La Habana. It is also an active musical form in Mexico and is still beloved in Puerto Rico. The danz√≥n evolved from the Cuban contradanza (also known as the habanera). In Cuba, these dances were influenced by African rhythmic and dance styles and so became a genuine fusion of European and African influences.Chasteen, John Charles 2004. National rhythms, African roots: the deep history of Latin American popular dance. Albuquerque, N.M. Chapter 5. The danz√≥n developed in 1879, and has been an important root for Cuban music up to today. Its precursor is the habanera, which is a creolized Cuban dance form. The danz√≥n was developed, according to one's point of view, by either Manuel SaumellCarpentier, Alejo 2001 [1945]. Music in Cuba. Minneapolis MN. p191 or Miguel Fa√≠lde in Matanzas.Failde, Osvalde Castillo 1964. Miguel Fa√≠lde: cr√©ador musical del Danz√≥n. Consejo Nacional de Cultura, La Habana. In 1998, the province Matanzas held a festival to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Danz√≥n. The form of danz√≥n created by Miguel Fa√≠lde in 1879 (\\"Las alturas de Simpson\\"), begins with an introduction (four bars) and paseo (four bars), which are repeated and followed by a 16-bar melody. The introduction and paseo again repeat before a second melody is played. The dancers do not dance during these sections: they choose partners, stroll onto the dance floor, and begin to dance at precisely the same moment: the fourth beat of bar four of the paseo, which has a distinctive percussion pattern that is hard to miss. When the introduction is repeated the dancers stop, chat, flirt, greet their friends, and start again, right on time as the paseo finishes. Early danz√≥n was played by groups called orquestas t√≠picas, which were based on wind instruments. They had several brass instruments (cornet, valve trombone, ophicleide), a clarinet or two, a violin or two and tympani (kettle drums). At the beginning of the 20th century, the lighter and somewhat more elegant sound of the charanga emerged (see Early Cuban bands). Initially, they were small orchestra of two violins, a cello, flute, timbales, g√ºiro, and doublebass. Charanga and t√≠picas competed with each other for years, but after 1930 it was clear that the days of the t√≠pica were over. Mambo Mambo is a musical form and dance style that developed originally in Cuba, with further significant developments by Cuban musicians in Mexico and the USA. The word \\"mambo\\" means \\"conversation with the gods\\" in Kikongo, the language spoken by Kongo slaves taken to Cuba. Modern mambo began with a song called \\"Mambo\\" written in 1938 by brothers Orestes and Cachao L√≥pez. The song was a danz√≥n, a dance form descended from European social dances like the English country dance, French contredanse, and Spanish contradanza. It was backed by rhythms derived from African folk music. Cha-cha-cha The cha-cha-cha, or simply cha-cha, is the name of a dance of Cuban origin.Orovio, Helio 2004. Cuban music from A to Z. p50Giro, Radam√©s 2007. Diccionario enciclop√©dico de la m√∫sica en Cuba. La Habana. p281 It is danced to the music of the same name introduced by Cuban composer and violinist Enrique Jorr√≠n in 1953. This rhythm was developed from the danz√≥n by a syncopation of the fourth beat. The name is onomatopoeic, derived from the rhythm of the g√ºiro (scraper) and the shuffling of the dancers' feet.Jorr√≠n, Enrique 1971. Origen del chachach√°. Signos 3, 49. Styles of cha-cha-cha dance may differ in the place of the chasse in the rhythmical structure.Cuban rhythms are usually scored in 2/4 time, whereas in North America the music would typically be scored in 4/4. This does not affect the sense of the text. The original Cuban and the ballroom cha-cha-cha count is \\"two, three, chachacha\\" or \\"four-and-one, two, three\\". The dance does not start on the first beat of a bar, though it can start with a transfer of weight to the lead's right.Laird, Walter 2003. The Laird Technique of Latin Dancing. International Dance Publications Ltd. Nevertheless, many social dancers count \\"one, two, cha-cha-cha\\" and may find it difficult to make the adjustment to the \\"correct\\" timing of the dance.The \\"one, two, cha-cha-cha\\" rhythm variant was popularized by the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra's Tea For Two Cha Cha(1958), and is arguably the correct timing when dancing to such arrangements. Bolero The Cuban bolero dance originated in Santiago de Cuba in the last quarter of the 19th century;Cristobal Diaz offers 1885: \\"el bolero, creado aproximadamente para 1885\\". Diaz Ayala, Cristobal 1999. Cuando sali de la Habana 1898-1997: cien a√±os de m√∫sica cubana por el mundo. 3rd ed, Cubanac√°n, San Juan P.R. p24-25 it does not owe its origin to the Spanish music and song of the same name.Carpentier, Alejo 2001 [1945]. Music in Cuba. Minneapolis MN. In the 19th century there grew up in Santiago de Cuba a group of itinerant musicians who moved around earning their living by singing and playing the guitar. Pepe S√°nchez is known as the father of the trova style and the creator of the Cuban bolero. Untrained, but with remarkable natural talent, he composed numbers in his head and never wrote them down. As a result, most of these numbers are now lost, but two dozen or so survive because friends and disciples wrote them down. He was the model and teacher for the great trovadores who followed.Orovio, Helio 2004. Cuban music from A to Z. p195.Orovio, Helio 1995. El bolero latino. La Habana. The Cuban bolero has traveled to Mexico and the rest of Latin America after its conception, where it became part of their repertoires. Some of the bolero's leading composers have come from nearby countries, most especially the prolific Puerto Rican composer Rafael Hern√°ndez; another example is Mexico's Agust√≠n Lara. Some Cuban composers of the bolero are listed under Trova.Loyola Fernandez, Jose 1996. El ritmo en bolero: el bolero en la musica bailable cubana. Huracan, Rio Piedras P.R.Orovio, Helio 1992. 300 boleros de oro. Mexico City.Restrepo Duque, Hern√°n 1992. Lo que cantan los boleros. Columbia.Rico Salazar, Jaime 1999. Cien a√±os de boleros: su historia, sus compositores, sus mejores interpretes y 700 boleros inolvidables. 5th ed, Bogot√°. Salsa Salsa dancing originated in Cuba. It evolved from earlier dance forms such as Cha cha cha and Mambo which were popular in New York, and incorporated elements of Swing dancing and Hustle, as well as elements of Afro-Cuban and Afro-Caribbean dances such as Guaguanco and Pachanga. In many styles of salsa dancing, as a dancer changes weight by stepping, the upper body remains level and nearly unaffected by the weight changes. Weight shifts cause the hips to move. Arm and shoulder movements are also incorporated. The Cuban Casino style of salsa dancing involves significant movement above the waist, with up-and- down shoulder movements and shifting of the ribcage. The arms are used by the \\"lead\\" dancer to communicate or signal the \\"follower,\\" either in \\"open\\" or \\"closed\\" position. The open position requires the two dancers to hold one or both hands, especially for moves that involve turns, putting arms behind the back, or moving around each other, to name a few examples. In the closed position, the leader puts the right hand on the follower's back, while the follower puts the left hand on the leader's shoulder. Ballet Ballet is one of the most popular and well-focused areas of dance in Cuba. Ballet shows are performed at the cabaret, which is where people go and watch the shows, while surrounding the stage enjoying food and beverages. Cabarets are very well known especially when a ballet show will be performing, although the more advanced ballet shows are performed at major theaters such as the Paris opera Ballet. Cuba has ballet schools across the country. The Cuban National Ballet School (Escuela Nacional Cubana de Ballet) in Havana, with approximately 3,000 students is the biggest ballet school in the world and the most prestigious ballet school in Cuba. La Escuela Nacional de Ballet - La Escuela desarrolla una experiencia √∫nica en el mundo, enmarcada en la Batalla de Ideas. It is directed by Ramona de S√°a. The Cuban National Ballet is also a renowned ballet company located in Havana. There are different types of ballet, but one of the most recognized and well distinguished is psycho ballet. Psycho ballet is a therapeutic art developed in 1973 by Alicia Alonso. This specific ballet is known to release spiritually satisfaction and enhance self-development. Psycho ballet is taught by a team leader and psychologist in many hospitals, schools and community centers across 17 countries for those who suffer from mental, motor, and several other disabilities. Their goal is to improve and strengthen the individuals sense of personality, growth, and a higher quality of life. Other countries that have experience this type of treatment are developing more research as it continues to guide and heal those who need it. Cuban ballet promoted a post colonial repositioning to the countries dance culture. This was a huge turn around for the dance community because dance is not only for those who have a passion for it, but those who have an interest, but never thought they could. In Cuba everyone knows ballet is a high career and the admission is intense with earning to be more than doctors. Today a government subsidized preprofessional ballet school operates in each of Cuba's fifteen provinces, this shows the importance of ballet and how much they value the art of it, as well as how the institute expanded as a whole.

Peacock had managed to make the Tar Heels one of the best teams in the South in the 1917‚Äì18 season, earning a record of 9‚Äì3, but he failed to repeat his success in the 1918‚Äì19 season, with the Tar Heels earning a record of 9‚Äì7. After Peacock's departure, Boye was hired to coach the team. Boye, a former World War I veteran, took over an experienced Tar Heel squad, but even so, he only managed to obtain a 7‚Äì9 record his first year, including one loss to the Durham YMCA. In his second year, he was more successful, earning a 12‚Äì8 record and going undefeated at home.

He was the author of the first Flora of Warwickshire (VC38) in 1891. A noted bryologist, he wrote the Handbook of Mosses in the Young Collector Series, various editions of which were published between 1886 and 1910.  Life  James Eustace Bagnall was born in Birmingham on 7 November 1830. He was the eldest son of James Bagnall (1804‚Äì1874) and his wife Jane Amelia (n√©e Wall, 1806‚Äì1888). When younger, he lived with his family in central Birmingham, being educated at Singers' Hill School; from 1881, census returns show him living with his sister Fanny in the Aston district of Birmingham. Initially he worked at his father's warehouse as a brass-founder. Between c. 1845 and 1897, he worked as a clerk at Hinks and Wells, who were Birmingham manufacturers of steel pen-nibs. He never married. He died on 3 September 1918.  Contributions to Natural History  \\"Bagnall did not discover the delights of botany until the age of 34, when a friend lent him a microscope.\\" He says of himself that \\"all my work, whether clerical or botanical, has been done in the scant leisure of a manufactory clerk\\" and that his \\"knowledge of botany has been self-acquired.\\" Via the collection of specimens and the collation of records, his main contribution was to what is now called biogeography. Bagnall was prominent member of the Birmingham Natural History and Microscopical Society. His herbarium and papers are held by the Library of Birmingham. The National Museum and Gallery of Wales, Cardiff, has 125 of his bryological specimens. Other herbaria hold specimens he collected (e.g. the Fielding-Druce Herbarium (OXF)). Local Floras Bagnall made important contributions to the Floras of the counties surrounding his home in Birmingham. One of his earliest publications, in 1874, was a moss Flora of Warwickshire. In 1876, he published a Flora of Sutton Park, now a National Nature Reserve. There were very few plant records from Sutton Park before this account, so that his Flora served as the foundation for all later Floras. A version with updated species names is available online. In 1891, his Flora of Warwickshire was published. This was the first Flora of Warwickshire (VC38), and was based on a series of papers Bagnall had published in the Midland Naturalist between 1881 and 1885. Comprising 561 pages in three sections, this comprehensive work describes the topography, geology and meteorology of the county; divides it into districts based on drainage basins; lists the flora, including bryophytes, lichens and fungi, with most records broken down by district; and finishes with a detailed history of botanising in Warwickshire. The Summary chapter contains statistical analyses, which show, for example, that Warwickshire contained 100% of the species known at the time from 80 or more British counties, but only 9% of those found in fewer than 10 counties, so that it was not a notable county for rare plants. The first attempt at a comprehensive Flora of Staffordshire (VC39) was by Robert Garner in 1844. cited in In 1901, when Bagnall was already well known for The Flora of Warwickshire, his Flora of Staffordshire was published. This 74 page work was intended to update Garner's Flora and contains a substantial number of new records, many by Bagnall himself. It was only superseded in 1972. Bagnall also contributed the botanical chapter for the 1908 volume of the Victoria County History of Staffordshire. As with his Flora of Warwickshire, Bagnall divided the county into drainage areas and classified records by these areas. Bryology Bagnall was a noted field bryologist. As mentioned above, one of his earliest publications, in 1874, was a moss Flora of Warwickshire. His most widely distributed work is his Handbook of Mosses, a contribution to The Young Collector Series published in London by Swan Sonnenschein, etc. The handbook was published and reprinted in at least six editions between 1886 and 1910, and is now available online. It describes how to study mosses, including the apparatus needed and the preparation and storage of specimens; their development, habitats (including descriptions of typical species) and geographical distribution; and their classification. It also includes chapters on cultivation and use. Bagnall contributed chapters or sections on bryophytes to a number of works, including the Victoria County History of Worcestershire in 1901, the Victoria County History of Warwickshire in 1904, the Victoria County History of Staffordshire in 1908 and The Botany of Worcestershire in 1909.

It is also considered to be of the 4X genre. Set in the fictional land of Aragon, the games casts its protagonist as the duke of a city named Aladda. After assuming rule over the city and avenging his father's death, the protagonist embarks on a quest to unify the land through conquest. Accomplishing this goal entails developing cities, recruiting armies, and directing the troops on the fields of battle to victory. First published for MS-DOS, the game was ported to Amiga machines. Reception towards Sword of Aragon tended to be more positive than negative; reviewers called it an exciting game, but criticized its method of copy protection and cited problems with its documentation. There were also opinions that the game was more of a niche product, catering to hardcore strategists.  Background  Sword of Aragon is a \\"strategic fantasy role-playing adventure\\" video game published in 1989. The game's setting is the fictional land of Aragon. A powerful human empire once held sway over the land, but infighting and raids by monsters such as orcs, goblins, and titans have broken it apart. The protagonist is the son of the Duke of Aladda, ruler of a city that used to be glorious under the old empire. The duke died during a raid by orcs and tasked his son through his will to fulfill his dream of reunifying the land. To achieve this goal, the young duke builds up his cities and expands his army, conquering or allying with other cities and races. Furthermore, he recovers three artifacts required to claim the throne, slays a dragon, and destroys the strongholds of monsters that plague the land. Eventually, he deposes the ruthless Emperor of the Tetradan Empire, Lucinian IV, and assumes the Aragonian throne.  Gameplay  Sword of Aragons maps comprise hexagonal arrangement of squares. Several units, up to a limit, can be stacked together in one hex. The player begins a game by choosing a character class for the protagonist. The choices are warrior, knight, mage, priest, and ranger. Each class has an affinity to a certain class of soldier-- warriors are more apt in leading infantry, and knights, cavalry. During battles, mages, rangers, and priests can also cast spells that damage foes, alter terrain, and heal friendly forces. The player can hire commanders of these classes to accompany the protagonist in his quest. After winning a number of battles, the player's character might receive offers of service from such commanders as well. The game is principally split between city management and tactical combat. Gameplay is turn-based, alternating between player and computer, and much of the game is played on the World Map, a representation of the land of Aragon. Each turn on this map represents a month in the game. The map shows cities and the player's units; unexplored areas are blanked out until they have been explored by the player's units. By using the keyboard and mouse, the player moves a cursor to select units and cities, and issue orders via keystrokes. Cities under the player's control provide monthly income, which is supplemented by tributes from vassals and loot from battles. Income from a city is improved by expending funds to develop the city's economic sectors, such as agriculture and mining, or by increasing taxation. Tax rates, however, affect the loyalty of citizens; high taxes in a city lead to a decreasing population. Armies are recruited in the cities, and their maintenance contributes to the monthly expenditure. Troops consist of infantry, cavalry, and bowmen. The game enters the tactical battle phase when enemies attack one of the player's cities that is garrisoned with troops, and when the player's forces move onto a hostile city. Encounters might also take place as the player's forces move on the World Map. On such occasions, the game switches the display to a large-scale map of the encounter. The battle maps differ from the World Map in that each spot has a limit on its number of occupants--a stacking limit. The player and computer take turns to deploy and move their forces. Units move at their standard pace or at a forced march to cover greater distances per turn in battles. Certain terrain gives defensive bonuses to their occupants, reducing the damage they suffer when coming under attack. Offensives take the form of melee, charges, missiles, and magic. The player has the option of letting the computer take control of his or her army to fight the battle. The game switches back to the World Map after a battle has concluded. Units that survive a battle gain experience points, improving their combat abilities on attaining certain numbers of experience points. They, with the exception of commanders, can also train in cities to improve their experience. Video games designer Alan Emrich considered Sword of Aragon gameplay typical of the \\"eXplore, eXpand, eXploit and eXterminate\\" nature of the 4X genre.  Development  Sword of Aragon was developed and published by Strategic Simulations, Inc., a video game company that dominated the 1980s market for digital wargames. Their products typically \\"copied the board game formula without adding revolutionary new elements.\\" Most strategy games at this time featured hexagon-based maps and a sequence of turns among players. Sword of Aragon plainly exhibits the influence of traditional board games in its design. Its maps are laid out in hexes, and the concept of stacking limits plays a strong part in the game's strategies. Written in Microsoft QuickBASIC and other languages, Sword of Aragon features a copy protection system that uses the game manual. On starting the game, the icon of an Aragonian city is displayed, along with a cue for a word in the manual's description of that city; a separate poster identifies the cities with their icons. The game proceeds only after the correct answer has been entered.  Reception  Sword of Aragons mechanics followed closely those of tabletop wargames--hex maps and stacking limits (as seen in this picture of a tabletop wargaming session). Sword of Aragon was released when fantasy-themed wargames were gaining popularity and computer wargames were starting to flourish as the rules of the board games grew in complexity. The digital versions were simpler in terms of their gameplay, as parts of the complex mechanics were handled by computers instead. Freed of dice rolling, complex calculations, and coordination of the sequence of play, casual gamers were more amenable to playing these games. According to Advanced Computer Entertainments John Minson, Sword of Aragon complied with part of this trend; its huge complicated set of rules would have made it an unplayable board game, but by hiding its mechanics from the player, the digital version could be played by anyone. However, as Minson further explained, the scope of the game was too large for casual gamers to handle, overwhelming them with \\"the number of factors under their control\\", and hardcore gamers are more likely to appreciate the game's complexity. In the January 1990 edition of Dragon (Issue 153), Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser believed that while the game was exciting, it suffered several design flaws that made the game too difficult for them. They found that the computer- controlled enemies constantly outpaced their economy and military might, and the game gave them no immediate opportunity to retreat their army when ambushed by superior forces, forcing them to suffer heavy losses. In the February-March 1990 edition of Games International (Issue 13), Dave Morris found that the programming did not allow the enemy to play intelligently, pointing out that \\"even on Expert level your opponents will be just as dumb ‚Äî there'll just be more of them.\\" He was also disappointed by the game's graphics. Morris conluded by giving the gameplay a poor rating of 5 out of 10 and the graphics an even poorer 4 out of 10, saying, \\"Fighting a succession of poor opponents became repetitious, and its almost impossible to lose a battle even if the odds are stacked against you.\\" Compute!s Adam Starkweather found it too easy in later stages of the game, as his character's well-developed armies \\"steamroll\\" their way through the opposition. The Lessers and Amiga Jokers Werner Hiersekorn felt the game ran slow on their computers, while Starkweather reflected that battles could take up to one and a half hours to complete. In 1990 and 1993 Computer Gaming World gave the game three-plus stars out of five, stating that it had \\"high playability\\". Several video game observers doubted the classification of Sword of Aragon as a role-playing game. Science fiction and fantasy novelist Orson Scott Card and Amiga Computings Lucinda Orr considered it more of a strategy than a role-playing game. John Minson of ACE was of like mind, and further elaborated that unlike the Dungeon and Dragon series of video games, Sword of Aragon failed to inspire players to identify themselves with the characters, giving a \\"coldly mechanical experience\\" instead. Datormagazins Hans Ekholm thought otherwise, saying the gameplay did not require any strategy, and considered Sword of Aragon \\"a fantasy role-playing/adventure game and nothing else\\". Critics had minor criticisms with the game's quality when comparing to its contemporaries. Minson called its interface \\"old-fashioned\\", and Computer Gaming World said it was \\"clunky\\" and \\"marginal\\", a description it also gave the game's graphics. Graphically, Orr and Zzap!64s Phil King found the game \\"primitive\\", though \\"adequate\\". More troubling to several reviewers was the game's copy protection system. Ekholm was not pleased that he had to unfold a flimsy poster to identify the requested city. His copy was falling apart after several identifications. The game further frustrated him when it failed to acknowledge the correct key. The provided hints were incorrect, a situation also experienced by the Lessers. The inaccuracies were not restricted to the copy protection. Starkweather pointed out discrepancies in the documentation-- several features of the game were either not explained or wrongly documented. Ekholm dismissed Sword of Aragon for its flawed copy protection and perceived lack of strategy. Hiersekorn was more condemning; rating the game poorly for its graphics and sound, and confused by its presented lists of military and economic data, he called the game a \\"cheap clone\\". Regardless, such issues did not deter other reviewers from praising the game. Pleased with the large number of options to manage their cities and to order their armies in combat, they felt the game was deep and offered many exciting moments; Kritzen judged the system \\"challenging and ultimately rewarding.\\" According to Retro Gamer magazine, \\"Sword of Aragon is considered by many to be the best fantasy wargame ever.\\" Starkweather was equally pronounced in his opinion. He called Sword of Aragon addictive and was willing to overlook issues with the game, finding pleasure in formulating strategies and tactics to overcome the enemy.

Taggart most recently served as the head coach at Florida State University. He has held the head coach position at four NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision programs: Western Kentucky (2009 to 2012 seasons); South Florida (2013 to 2016 seasons); Oregon (2017 season); and Florida State (2018 season and part of the 2019 season -- through November 3, 2019). At all four schools, he was the first African-American to be hired as the head coach. Playing career High school career Taggart was a prep standout at Manatee High School in Bradenton, Florida, where he was a first team all-state and all-conference selection as a senior after guiding the Hurricanes to the state 5A Championship game. He helped lead the football team to the state title his junior season and helped the school post a 26‚Äì4 record during that two-year span, while recording more than 3,000 yards passing and 975 yards on the ground. College career After high school, Taggart became a star quarterback for the Western Kentucky University (WKU) Hilltoppers from 1995 through 1998, being one of only three WKU players in the previous 50 years to be a four-year starter at the position and one of only four Hilltoppers players to have his jersey retired. In each of his last two collegiate seasons, he was a finalist for the prestigious Walter Payton Award, which is an honor given annually to the top offensive player in I-AA football. Taggart finished fourth in the balloting in 1997 and seventh as a senior the following year. An All-American as a senior, he was also the 1998 I-AA Independents‚Äô Offensive Player of the Year. Taggart was recruited to WKU by Jim Harbaugh to play for his father, Jack Harbaugh. Coaching career Early coaching years After graduating from WKU in 1998, Taggart stayed on at the school as an assistant through 2006, serving as co-offensive coordinator under Jack Harbaugh on the Hilltoppers' 2002 Division I-AA national champions. He also worked alongside Harbaugh's son Jim, who had been an unpaid certified assistant coach under his father in the final years of his NFL career. When Jim Harbaugh was named head coach of the Stanford Cardinal football team following the 2006 season, he hired Taggart as his running backs coach. Taggart served in that role for the next two seasons, developing Doak Walker Award winner and Heisman runner-up Toby Gerhart into a star during that time. The younger Harbaugh also gave Taggart responsibility for recruiting in Taggart's home state of Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, and Riverside County, California.  Western Kentucky (2010‚Äì2012)  In 2010, Taggart left his position at Stanford as the running backs coach in order to become the head football coach of his alma-mater, Western Kentucky. In their first year under Taggart, the Hilltoppers broke a 26-game losing streak while finishing the season with a record of 2‚Äì10. In 2011, Taggart led WKU to a 7‚Äì5 season, where the Hilltoppers lost the first 4 games of the season, but then won 7 of their last 8 games. Although having a winning record, they were not invited to a bowl game that year. In 2012, Taggart led WKU once again to a bowl-eligible record of 7‚Äì5. The Hilltoppers accepted an invitation to play Central Michigan in the Little Caesars Bowl on December 26, 2012, on ESPN. However, Taggart did not coach in this bowl game having already accepted the head coaching position of the South Florida Bulls on December 7, 2012.  South Florida (2013‚Äì2016)  On December 7, 2012, Taggart took over as head coach at the University of South Florida in his native Tampa Bay area. In his first season, Taggart led the Bulls to a 2‚Äì10 season. The following season, Taggart's team doubled the number of wins and finished with a 4‚Äì8 record. During the off-season, Taggart made several personnel changes, including replacing the offensive and defensive coordinators. The change of schemes as well as the development of his first two recruiting classes provided the team with much needed energy and depth of positions. In 2015, led by conference leaders quarterback Quinton Flowers and running back Marlon Mack, the Bulls started the season 1‚Äì3 before finishing the regular season with a record of 8‚Äì5 and earning bowl eligibility for the first time in five years. The Bulls lost to WKU in the Miami Beach Bowl. In 2016, the Bulls went 10‚Äì2 and won a share of the AAC East division. This was the Bulls first double digit win season in school history. Oregon (2017) Taggart with the Green Garter Band On December 7, 2016, the University of Oregon announced Taggart as the Ducks' new head coach, replacing the fired Mark Helfrich. In January 2017, three Oregon football players were hospitalized after grueling military-style workouts. Multiple sources described the workouts to the Oregonian as \\"akin to military basic training, with one said to include up to an hour of continuous push-ups and up-downs.\\" Taggart personally visited the ill and hospitalized players to wish them a speedy recovery. \\"I have visited with the three young men involved in the incidents in the past few days and I have been in constant contact with their families, offering my sincere apologies,‚Äù Taggart said in the statement. ‚ÄúAs the head football coach, I hold myself responsible for all of our football- related activities and the safety of our students must come first. I have addressed the issue with our strength and conditioning staff, and I fully support the actions taken today by the university. I want to thank our medical staff and doctors for caring for all of our young men, and I want to apologize to the university, our students, alumni and fans.‚Äù Taggart's hiring at Oregon drew attention to the low number of African American head coaches in major college football (14 out of 128 schools). The hiring came several years after Oregon‚Äôs passing of House Bill 3118, which requires state-funded schools to interview qualified minority candidates for top coaching and athletic administration positions. Oregon went 7-5 overall and 4-5 in the Pac-12 in 2017 with Taggart at the reins. The Ducks beat Nebraska, Arizona and rival Oregon State. They were bested by UCLA, Stanford and Washington. Additionally, the Ducks lost The Las Vegas Bowl to Boise State on December 16 with Mario Cristobal at the helm after Taggart accepted the position at Florida State.  Florida State (2018‚Äì2019)  On December 5, 2017, Taggart accepted the head coaching job at Florida State, replacing Jimbo Fisher. In his first season, the Seminoles finished 5-7, their first losing season on the field since 1976, Bobby Bowden's first year. They were not invited to a bowl for the first time since the end of the 1981 season, breaking the longest active bowl appearance streak in FBS. Florida State fans were not used to staying home for bowl season, and there were numerous calls for Taggart's firing. However, school president John Thrasher and athletic director Dave Coburn voiced confidence in Taggart. According to a story in Bleacher Report, Florida State had bottomed out in 2018 due in part to cultural problems dating from Fisher's tenure. In particular, Taggart was stunned at the football team's casual approach to academics. When he arrived, Florida State had the worst Academic Progress Rate in FBS, and was on the brink of an automatic bowl ban, which further complicated his efforts to rebuild the program. Following a 4-5 start to the 2019 season, Taggart was fired during mid-season in November 2019. For the removal of Taggart, Florida State had to pay over $20M in buyouts, including about $18M to Taggart after the firing and over $4M paid to Oregon at his hiring ($3M to end Taggart's contract with Oregon and additional $1.3M Oregon still owe South Florida for hiring Taggart away).  Florida Atlantic (2020‚Äìpresent)  On December 11, 2019, two days after Lane Kiffin resigned from FAU and accepted the head coach position at Ole Miss, FAU announced the hiring of Taggart as the school's next head coach. The 5-year contract would pay Taggart $750,000 annually with a $3M buyout if Taggart leaves before December 1, 2022.

Ouellette was born to Fran√ßois Ouellette and Josephine Lasant√© in the faubourg √† M‚Äôlasse, a working-class neighbourhood in Montr√©al, Quebec. In her teens, she dropped out of school and worked at a shoe factory in order to provide income for her large family. In the later part of her career, she appeared in film and on television, but she is most remembered for her work on stage. She is known as the first woman ever to have directed two individual playhouses in North America.  Career  Ouellette began her career at the age of 12, when she won several local singing and theater contests. At age 19, she was noticed by Paul H√©bert after performing at the Ouimetoscope and Lune rousse theatres in Montr√©al. She formed a duo with Olivier Guimond (senior), which quickly became popular throughout Qu√©bec. Ouellette called herself \\"Casserole\\" at first, but eventually took the stage name \\"La Poune\\" in order to complement Guimond‚Äôs own stage name, \\"Ti-Zoune.\\" Ouellette was a leading figure of the very popular burlesque and vaudeville genres which dominated the theatrical scene in Montreal from the 1920s until the 1960s.

Following the liberation he performed as a member of various ensembles, The Film Symphonic Orchestra (FISYO) among others. At the beginning of the 1960s he formed his own professional band. The ensemble used elements of jazz, rock and country in their compositions. Karel Duba Ensemble was also the first Czech music group experimenting with electric guitars.

A translation of the legend of Waltham Abbey cites the Lord of Waltham as 'Tovi le Prude', \\"totius Angliae post regnem primus\\" (prude = prudent, wise, sagacious). He was staller (a placeman or court office-holder) to King Cnut the Great.Williams et al., A Biographical Dictionary of Dark Age Britain, page 229.  Early life  Little is known about the years of Tovi the Proud pre-1026 though he appears to have had a role in the administration of East Anglia and Essex, these interests and gifted land holdings there indicate that prior to 1017, he was either in Cnut the Great's retinue or in that of Thorkell the Tall who was Jarl of East Anglia 1017 to 1023. By 1017 he was in possession of Reading, he went on to hold crucial roles in court 'guiding the monarch and closest to the king in his counsels'. Chronological problems of documents show Tovi pruda to appear to have been added as a revision to earlier lists of secular officials from 1020-1, his name placed at the head of secular officials, alongside his contemporary Osgod Clapa. Although in good enough health to have traveled from the far side of the kingdom where he had been on business with the king, he was considered already 'old and feeble' in the story of the legend of Waltham Holy Cross in the first half of the 1030s. This Waltham Chronicle also records that Tovi was 'a man of great wealth' (preduies), acquired not only through inheritance and the king's largesse, but also because his relationship with the king enabled him 'to benefit or harm anyone he wished.'  The Legend of the Holy Cross  According to the Waltham Chronicle, it was on his manor at Montacute in Somerset that a black crucifix or Holy Rood was unearthed following a dream in 1030. The account relates that Tovi loaded the life-sized cross onto a cart, but the oxen refused to move until he mentioned another of his estates at Waltham in Essex where he already had a hunting lodge.The Waltham Chronicle, ed. Watkiss and Chibnall, pages 15, 18 Tovi rebuilt the church at Waltham to house the cross, on which he bestowed his own sword. His devout second wife Gytha (or Glitha), the daughter of Osgod Clapa, adorned the figure with a crown, bands of gold and precious stones.Dodwell, Anglo-Saxon Art: A New Perspective, page 119. The cross became the object of pilgrimage, notably by Harold Godwinson. 'Thurkill the Sacristan', an eyewitness to the episode told of the cross giving a sign foretelling the failure of Harold's Battle at Hastings in 1066, as told by the Canon of Waltham author of 'De Inventione Sancte Crucus Nostre' in the 12th century.  1040s  It was at Tovi's wedding at Lambeth on 8 June 1042 that King Harthacnut suddenly died of a convulsion \\"while standing at his drink\\".Barlow, The Godwins: The Rise and Fall of a Noble Dynasty, page 109. Harthacnut had little support as king and his mother Emma of Normandy, second wife of Cnut the Great, is implicated in bolstering Harthacnut's succession using her links with the East Anglian thegns in Cnut the Great's court. A return of stallers such as Tovi the Proud and Osgod Clapa to witness lists is found at this time. There is no specific record for Tovi pruda after 1043. The Waltham Chronicle records Tovi and Glytha showering the Holy Cross with gifts which presumably would be in the period following their marriage in 1042. It is possible that Tovi died, simply left court to return to his estates, or was exiled following the dynastic pendulum swing back in favour of the native born Edward the Confessor in the early 1040s. Tovi's contemporary and new father-in-law Osgod Clapa, who appears to have been in opposition to Edward the Confessor's succession and led an unsuccessful revolt, was outlawed around 1046, later apparently to die in exile. Certainly the threat of invasion from Magnus the Good of Norway split the English court and led to King Edward confiscating the property of his mother, Queen Emma, who was planning to use it to help Magnus. However it is unclear if any of the above are reasons for Tovi pruda's absence or if political events elsewhere, in the by now disintegrated North Sea Empire, can account for it. Adam of Breman briefly describes that in 1047 King Sven of Sweden and an otherwise unknown Earl Tovi drove Magnus from Denmark, and when Magnus resumed the war he [Magnus] died on board his ship. The contemporary Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reports that Sven of Sweden asked for 50 ships to help in the fight against Magnus and that, in England, Magnus was considered a serious threat, \\"but the battle between him and Sven prevented him from coming here\\". Notable circumstantially is that Osgod Clapa is thought to have entered the service of Sven in late 1046 and in the years following the victory in Denmark, Sven of Sweden's coinage shows many influences and a continued link with Anglo-Scandinavian England. It is possible that Tovi the Proud is the Tovi comes to whom King Edward gave two hides at Burghe in 1048.  Land holdings  The Domesday records are a major source of information regarding Tovi's estates. Tovi the Sheriff, a Somerset landholder in 1086 is likely to be a descendant of Tovi the Proud. Unclear though, is how much land Tovi gifted to the church or to his kinsman during his lifetime. Evidence survives of a Tovi leaving land at Stilton, now in Cambridgeshire, to the church. It is known the estates pertaining to Tovi's position as staller passed to his son Athelstan (or √Üthelstan) and to Tovi's grandson Asgar also known as the major land holder Esgar the Staller, marshal in the court of Edward the Confessor. The Waltham Chronicle mentions Athelstan as losing those lands not connected to the position of staller through his 'insufficiencies' and the Chronicle translators cite suggestions that Athelstan is √Ülfstan the Staller documented in Florence of Worcester's account of the Osgod Clapa led raids. Following the Norman Conquest, Asgar the Staller's long running land dispute with the Diocese of Ely came to the attention of King William the Conqueror, who then had Asgar confined to a castle in France. Neither Asgar nor his two sons were to return to England. Asgar's estates were given to the Norman Baron Geoffrey de Mandeville.Wareham, Lords and Communities in Early Medieval East Anglia, page 113.Lands held by persons called Esgar in 1066, PASE Domesday Waltham Abbey was described as being given to Harold Godwinson by St Edward (Edward the Confessor) in the Waltham Chronicle.  Origins  The root and meaning of the Tovi name is very ancient, with the clearest link for an older origin being found in the dedication on the S√∏nder Vissing Runestone. The carvings describe the stone as having been raised by T√≥fa, in memory of her mother. The first character of her name is ·õè, the Rune for T√Ωr, a Northern European deity thought to be of early origins in an Indo-European Pantheon. He was a sky god, god of justice, sacrifice and war. Later associations with Thor seen throughout the internet, in heraldry and publications, appear to have arisen not from evidence but from more modern speculations and probable confusion from the simplifications of multiple Norse deities. The dominance of Odin and Thor in the Norse pantheon coincides with the time that monotheistic religions such as Christianity were influencing and challenging the polytheism of the older cultures in Northern European regions. The letter V, often used as evidence that Tovi derives from a diminutive of a longer name was a Latinisation of the Rune ·ö† and Medieval additions to the Younger Futharc duplicated the use of some of the 16 Runic characters used in the 9th to 11th centuries. The Rune for V is the same as that used for F. Pruda in old Norse, pr√∫√∞r (pr√∫√∞r meaning: proud/splendid fine; magnificent; stately; splendid; gallant; brave) It is tempting to speculate that T√≥fi pr√∫√∞r (Tovi pruda) was a younger relation named after T√≥fa (Tove of the Obotrites), but no direct evidence to support this has come to light at present other than the presence of a Tovi Wendish fl. 1066 in the Domesday records as land holder in parts of Gloucestershire However an Earl Tovi's presence in Denmark during 1047 adds a personal dimension to the conflict in the region at that time. Magnus the Good is attributed to have been responsible for the destruction of parts of Wendland; most notable in this instance as the heartland of the legendary Jomsvikings and ancestral homeland of Tove of the Obotrites. The earlier echoes of the Tovi and the Asgar names can be seen on the Sj√∂rup Runestone attributed to the Jomsviking participation in the Battle of F√Ωrisvellir at Uppsala, but there is no other link to prove a family connection of T√≥fi pr√∫√∞r (Tovi pruda) to √Åsbj√∂rn, the son of T√≥fi/T√≥ki other than by name. Other runestone translations also link a Tofi of an earlier generation to the lineage of Gorm the Old. While it is often difficult to identify Tovi pruda from other Tovi thegns of Harthacnut and Edward the Confessor's court, circumstantially a link to Tove of the Obotrites and the court of Harald Bluetooth would do much to explain the preeminent position of Tovi pruda at the court of Cnut the Great during the establishment of the North Sea Empire. If Tovi had been in Thorkell the Tall's retinue in his early years, he would have been one of those to whom the Encomium Emmae was aimed, who remembered Thorkell as the great war leader in service to the king. Present Day Tovi the Proud's name is commemorated by a handmade artisan confectionery shop of the same name, based in Quaker Lane, Waltham Abbey. Residents of Waltham Abbey regularly hold a commemorative day to celebrate the carrying of the Holy Cross from Somerset to Waltham, inviting descendants of Tovi pruda to take part.

By 1908, Cyma was advertising the resilience of their timepieces when exposed to electricity, magnetism and varying temperatures. The company is currently owned by Stelux International, Ltd. a Hong Kong-based holdings firm which invests primarily in fine jewellery and watches, and is overseen by fellow F√©d√©ration de L'industrie Horlog√®re Suisse member Universal Gen√®ve. History The Schwob brothers named the company cyma, a Latin word meaning \\"sprout\\", and the origin of the French \\"cime\\" or summit. In early years, the company had a staff of 40 people and 55 machines that together produced about 40 watches a day. However, it was not until 1892 in which the brothers partnered with Fr√©d√©ric Henri Sandoz, the owner of the watch wholesale company, Henri Sandoz et Cie, that the business expanded. Under Sandoz's leadership, the company became the Cyma Watch Company and built the Cyma factory in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland in the Jura Mountains, near Le Locle. Both towns had been the center of the Swiss watchmaking industry during the 19th century. The company is currently located in Le Locle and is provincially managed by Claude and Fran√ßoise Guilgot.

He made a total of 43 league appearances during the two seasons, securing himself a move to the Croatian top flight in the summer of 2006, signing with Meƒëimurje. At Meƒëimurje, he started out as the second-choice goalkeeper, with two league appearances early in the season being his only top-flight appearances during his first season with the club. He managed to become the club's first-choice goalkeeper midway through the 2007‚Äì08 season, keeping his place despite the club's relegation from the top flight at the end of the season and going on to help them return to the top flight for the 2009‚Äì10 season.

The main character is Jake \\"Cool Hand\\" Grafton, a naval aviator who appears in a series of sequels. The book, which was made into a movie of the same name and adapted into a video game, marked the beginning of Stephen Coonts' career as a best-selling novelist. Plot summary Flight of the Intruder begins with a night attack mission flown by Jake Grafton and his navigator Morgan \\"Morg\\" McPherson from the USN aircraft carrier, USS Shiloh, striking a target in North Vietnam. Although there are many militarily valuable targets in North Vietnam, Grafton and other aviators are instead routinely ordered to hit worthless targets--typically \\"suspected truck parks\\". The pilots are barred from hitting the more valuable targets because of restrictive \\"rules of engagement\\" imposed on American forces. Despite the minimal damage even a successful strike will inflict on the enemy (whom the aviators refer to as \\"Gomers\\"), North Vietnamese airspace is heavily defended, making the missions extremely dangerous for the aviators. Grafton and Morg elude most of the defenses, but a stray shot fired by a lone farmer on the ground fatally wounds Morg. Traumatized by the loss of his good friend, Grafton begins to question whether his efforts have been worth it. He is eventually paired up with Virgil 'Tiger' Cole as his new navigator. Cole, an aggressive veteran with experience over the most heavily defended areas of North Vietnam, becomes aware of Grafton's frustrations, and the two begin to plan an unauthorized mission against a Communist Party center in Hanoi, which will be a serious violation of the restrictive rules of engagement. With the help of one of the Shiloh's intelligence officers, Cole and Grafton locate and plan the mission. Flying the mission nearly proves fatal due to problems with the A-6's weapons system. Once completed, they don't even know if they successfully hit anything. Grafton's superiors soon learn of the unauthorized strike--there is no way to hide the fact that Grafton's plane was shot at by Surface to Air Missiles, yet no SAM sites were positioned near the target they were supposed to hit. Both Grafton and Cole are prosecuted by the Navy, with a conviction being certain. The charges are dropped however, as the Richard Nixon administration is about to authorize a massive new air war campaign against Hanoi, \\"Linebacker II\\". The Navy decides that they can't prosecute pilots for flying a mission against Hanoi when the President is about to order an escalation along the same lines. The remainder of the novel follows Grafton's exploits in what became known as The Christmas Bombings. He also romances Callie, his future wife. He is shot down during the offensive, and is forced to confront the horror of war on the ground, and the story closes with Grafton being rescued. Characters *Jake \\"Cool Hand\\" Grafton - Naval aviator, protagonist. *Virgil \\"Tiger\\" Cole - An experienced aviator. He has flown in missions over Hanoi at least twice, and his favorite missions are those against missile sites. *Commander Frank Camparelli - The commanding officer of Grafton's A-6 squadron. *\\"Cowboy\\" - also a naval aviator. Cowboy will appear in the sequel Final Flight. A man of few words, Cowboy's persona hides a man of above average intelligence. *Morgan \\"Morg\\" McPherson; Grafton's navigator and close friend. *Callie - Grafton's love interest. They meet when Grafton tours Hong Kong. *\\"Rabbit\\" Wilson - A naval aviator with seniority over Grafton, but hobbled by his fear of night flying, which has led to his being mocked by other pilots. Wilson avoids many night missions by \\"finding\\" technical faults with his assigned aircraft. Eventually, his \\"downing\\" of a night mission aircraft comes to the attention of superior officers. His fate is never specified, though it is presumed that he is removed from flying status. Aircraft appearing/mentioned *The Grumman A-6 Intruder. A two-man, twin-engine bomber flown from aircraft carriers. The Intruder uses sophisticated electronics to find and attack targets in bad weather and/or at night--though the equipment often proves unreliable. The Intruder also lacks any defensive weapons against fighters. *The McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, also a two-man, twin-engine warplane flown from USN aircraft carriers. It lacks the sophisticated ground attack capability of the Intruder, but is also more capable than that plane against enemy fighters. An enemy pursuing Grafton is driven off by a Phantom. *The Vought A-7 Corsair II, a simple, one-man, carrier-borne, ground-attack aircraft. Grafton compares his own Intruder to the Corsair, wishing the Intruder were armed with an internal gun like the Corsair was. *Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19 Farmer, a twin-engine, supersonic interceptor flown by the air force of North Vietnam. In one mission, Grafton is tasked to attack a group of MiG-19's on the ground. The MiG-19 is derided as a day fighter that would be \\"mincemeat\\" if caught in the air by Phantoms.  Video game  Flight of the Intruder, a video game based on the novel, was released for personal computers in 1990 and re-released for the Nintendo Entertainment System around the same time as the film adaptation. Certain boxed copies of the personal computer versions included a copy of the novel as well. Developed by Rowan Software, Ltd. and published by Spectrum Holobyte, the game allowed players the choice of flying either the A-6 intruder or the F-4 from aircraft carriers against targets in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Players were challenged both by the comprehensive enemy defenses and the restrictive and complex rules of engagement. Realistic features included unreliable missiles and smokey engines for the Phantom. (As in real life, the trail would disappear in afterburner.) At lower realism settings, F-4's had missiles and an internal cannon - in contrast to real USN whose F-4's were armed only with missiles. Sequels Flight of the Intruder lays the groundwork for other Stephen Coonts novels. In particular, The Intruders, which details Grafton's flying in the immediate aftermath of the Vietnam War, and Final Flight (written before the other sequels) which shows Grafton as CAG of an aircraft carrier boarded by terrorists. In other books, the character of Jake Grafton eventually continues serving the USN into the 1990s, following the collapse of the Soviet Union and Desert Storm. Eventually, he finds himself serving as an assistant to the Joint Chiefs, and is last heard from in the book The Disciple, working for the CIA (by this time in his late 50s to early 60s).

The series started serialization in the 14th issue of the biweekly manga magazine Hana to Yume on June 20, 2009. In order to accurately present the voice acting business in the manga, the company 81 Produce and the professional Tokyo Animation Institute were involved in references and research. Plot Hime Kino is a 15-year-old girl who attends Hiiragi High School Academy, one of the top schools in the nation, for its voice acting department. Hime's biggest dream is to one day become the voice of a main character in one of the most popular sh≈çjo manga series in Japan, \\"Mahou Senshi Lovely Blazers\\". This is difficult to achieve, however, as her voice is not suitable as a professional voice actress, resembling that of a gorilla, thug or even an old hag. Characters ; : :Hime is the protagonist of the story. Ever since her encounter with the talented voice actress Sakura Aoyama as a child, she has aimed for the goal of being a voice actress herself. She is energetic and determined, but lacks great talent in the subject she wants to perfect the most: voice acting. However, the head teacher of the department saw great hidden talent within her and allowed her to enter the voice acting department despite her underdeveloped voice acting talents. Whenever she introduces herself and attempts to make a cute, girly voice, it turns out to be a very thick, scratchy, middle-aged man voice. Thus, she earns the nickname \\"Gori-Hime\\" (roughly, \\"Gorilla Princess\\") among her classmates. However, during the 2nd-year vs. bottom 4 dropouts Snow White showdown, Hime portrays an alluring voice for the prince in Snow White, gaining the attention of not only Senri Kudou, but the popular Producer of Idol Unit AQUA named Haruka Yamada. Later on when she is recruited by Producer Yamada, he decides to debut her as a male voice actor. Thus, she leads a double-life under the name Shiro. She belongs to GGC Productions. After finally realising that she is in love with Kudou Senri,Mizuki confess to her. At the end of the series, it is presumed that she is now the voice actress of Lovely Blazer and is married to Kudou Senri. It is also seen that she is encouraging a little girl named Miu like how Sakura Aoyama encouraged her in the past. ; : :Senri is a first-year student in the Hiiragi Academy's voice acting department and the son of Sakura Aoyama, the actress whom Hime admires. He is already a professional voice actor in the voice acting industry, despite only being 15 years old. He is also a good singer, good-looking, and has astounding grades. He shows a cold-hearted attitude toward Hime once he finds out she admires his mother and chooses to ignore her since she doesn't interest him in the least. However, when she portrays the prince's role in Snow White, he helps her out when nobody else is available. He also tries to help her practice her cute voice, but is too distracted by her smile. Even though he portrays a cold exterior, he has a soft spot for small animals. For some reason, this sometimes allows him to soften up around when he occasionally associates Hime with a cat. He is currently active in the anime Lesson Detour. It also seems that he has a close relationship with Shiro, who is actually Hime(he eventually found out that Shiro and Hime are the same person and does not plan to expose this secret). He falls in love with Hime later on in the series. At the end of the series, it is presumed that he is now the director of Lovely Blazer(with Hime as one of the voice actress) and is married to Hime. ; : :Mizuki Haruyama is a 2nd-year in Hiiragi Academy's acting department and, along with Shuuma, is one of the Idol Unit AQUA and mediated the Snow White showdown. He's gentle-hearted, with a mysterious, more sinister side due to his painful past. When Mizuki was 10 he became friends with a girl named Sana who was known for failing at everything. When she entered Junior High she decided to become an actor at the same time Mizuki entered the entertainment business. Due to her lack of success Sana gave up on her dream. This greatly hurt Mizuki who blamed himself for 'abandoning' Sana, and who'd made her dream his own. Since then they slowly drifted apart, causing Mizuki to lose one of his only true friends. Hime is the first person in a long time that he's shown interest in becoming friends with as she greatly resembles Sana. As of lately Mizuki has begun to question himself about his feelings towards Hime. He shows jealousy whenever Hime and Senri are together even going so far as to make sure Hime doesn't get near him. As of chapter 52, he realized that he is actually in love with Hime. He belongs with GGC Production and one of the two(except Senri)that was informed by Director Yamada that Hime is actually Shiro to help her in her further work. At the near end, he says he needs to work harder and become more mature so that Hime might even come to fall in love with him later. ; : :Tsukino is a first-year student in the voice acting department. She is one of the bottom 4 dropouts simply because her voice is too soft. She feels insecure about her soft voice, but takes a deep liking to Hime when she compliments her soft voice. Tsukino is involved with the black arts and has been known for cursing others, especially Mitchi. At the end of the series, she is seen becoming an Idol Voice Actress. ; : :Shou is a first-year student in the voice acing department. He is one of the bottom 4 dropouts due to his violent temper and inability to read kanji without furigana attached to them. His loyalty to his friends is strong and he promises Hime and the others that if anyone messes with them, he'll send them to their death in a minimum of 20 seconds. His hopes to become a voice actor voicing delinquent characters. However, he feels determined to develop other sides of him that surface when Ume takes a liking to him. Despite his violent exterior, he is rather shy around girls since he has little experience with them. At the end of the series, he is seen working with Sound Director Yajima. ; : : Mitchel is often called by his nickname \\"Mitchi\\". He is the one of the 4 dropouts of the voice acting class. He lived in Monaco until he was 7 years old. His voice is excellent, but the reason he is in the dropout class is because he refuses to give up his foreign accent. He is full of himself, and he easily breaks under pressure. He was supposed to be the prince in their Snow White showdown, but Tsukino cursed him when he belittled Hime's talents, thus causing him to fall extremely ill before their performance. He often takes a leadership role in the dropouts' group. At the end of the series, he is seen designing anime figures ; : He is a producer for GGC Production, and the producer of the popular Idol Unit AQUA. He often checks out the voice acting department to scout new talent. In actuality, he visits simply to check up on Senri and tries to convince him to join his newest production. However, after hearing Hime do the prince's role he becomes quite interested in scouting her as well. When she doesn't do very well at the one-line thug role he assigned her a few days later, he wonders if he misjudged her, only to be blown away in awe by her final attempt. He fires her, only to reveal that he has bigger plans for her in the future. Ever since then, he has planned to scout her for his own production as well. When he comes to scout a second time, after meeting Hime's mother and realizing that she thinks Hime's sister is more popular and important than Hime, and that Hime still continue to smile, so he promises her that he will help her accomplish her dream if she can do the same for him. At the near end, he is seen talking with Director Yajima saying he would like to develop the talent of a girl who might be Hime. ; :He is a 2nd-year in Hiiragi Academy's acting department and one of the Idol Unit AQUA boys. He was one of the mediators of the 2nd-year vs. 4-dropout Snow White Showdown. He is rarely seen without his partner, Mizuki Haruyama. He is overprotective of Mizuki and causes his fangirls to harass Hime. After Mizuki calms his wrath by punching him, he is reduced to simply giving Hime evil glares and giving some sarcastic remarks towards Hime which earns him some smacking and glares from Mizuki. He later reveals Mizuki's past to Hime in the hopes that she will stop unknowingly torturing Mizuki through her presence. He later comes to accept Hime somewhat though he still acts stubborn whenever she is with Mizuki. He eventually warms up to Hime(as Shiro) when she helps him on stage where he forgots his microphone. He belongs with GGC Production and one of the two(except Senri)that was informed by Director Yamada that Hime is actually Shiro to help her in her further work. ; :Akane is the 10-year-old sister of Hime. She is the picture of perfection to her parents, which causes her to feel incredibly guilty that her parents do not treat Hime as well as her. She is constantly worrying about Hime. ; : :Ume is a first-year in Hiiragi Academy's art department and the leader of the Idol Unit AQUA followers. She draws cartoons for online communities. When Hime, Shou, Tsukino, and Mitchii are preparing for a noon broadcast, they discover Ume and try to get her to draw their storyboard for them. However, she has troubles coming up with the perfect male role, but when Shou saves her from falling down a flight of stairs, she finds her motivation and becomes close to Hime and her friends. At the end of the series, she is seen becoming an animator. ; :Sakura Aoyama is a successful actress who started out as a voice actress for the sh≈çjo anime series Mahou Senshi Lovely Blazers.

He was quite well known at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century, in both the UK and the US, but he was soon forgotten after his death. Biography Het Maarten Maartenshuis. The author was born on 15 August 1858 in Amsterdam as Jozua Marius Willem Schwartz. His friends and relations called him Joost. His father August Ferdinand Carl Schwartz (1817‚Äì1870) was a vicar at the Scottish Missionary Church.The building, then owned by the Free Church of Scotland was built as a theatre and is now a theatre again. Nowadays it is called De Kleine Komedie Jozua's father was originally Jewish, but had converted to Christianity. He became a clergyman with the special task of convincing other Jews to take the same step.Gorissen, p. 33 In 1864 the family Schwartz moved to London, where Jozua's father started missionary work among the London Jews. Jozua owed his skill in the English language to this stay in England. When Jozua's father died in 1870, the family at first returned to Amsterdam and then went to Bonn in Germany. In 1877 Jozua Schwartz finished his grammar school education there.Gorissen, p. 38 He returned to the Netherlands, where he studied law at Utrecht University. In 1882 he took his PhD Shortly afterwards he stood in for his instructor, Professor Jacobus Anthonie Fruin, who had fallen ill. When Fruin died in 1884, Jozua Schwartz applied for his position, but was not selected. In 1883 Jozua Schwartz had married his cousin Anna van Vollenhoven (1862‚Äì1924). She belonged to a rich Amsterdam family. Thanks to the money she brought into the marriage Jozua never had to look for a job. Both Jozua and Anna suffered from bad health. Jozua Schwartz later used their manifold experiences with doctors in his novels The Healers and The New Religion. The couple travelled extensively, often to health resorts. When Anna became too weak to accompany him, Jozua mostly took his butler with him, and later his daughter Ada (1888‚Äì1944).Gorissen, p. 45 In 1884 Jozua Schwartz bought a rural estate in Doorn, a small town in the central Netherlands. There he ordered a small castle built, partly after his own design. The castle was finished in 1903. He called it Zonheuvel ('Sun Hill'). In 1889 Jozua Schwartz got permission to add the name Van der Poorten (one of his great-grandmothers went by that name) to his own name. From then on he was called Jozua Marius Willem van der Poorten Schwartz. Van der Poorten Schwartz was deeply shocked when World War I broke out in 1914. He fell into a depression and his state of health deteriorated quickly. On 3 August 1915 he died. His wife Anna, who had always been even more frail than he was, outlived him for nine years.Gorissen, p. 52 Their daughter Ada, who never married, rechristened Zonheuvel Het Maarten Maartenshuis ('The Maarten Maartens House') and turned it into a conference centre. Some rooms, among them the library, have been left in the state they were in when 'Maarten Maartens' was still living. Literary career Maarten Maartens wrote novels, short stories, plays and poems. He started his literary career in the years 1885‚Äì1888. In those years he published two collections of poems and two tragedies in verse, in English, his second language, and with a British publisher (three of them with Remington & Co). He still wrote under his own name (then J.M.W. Schwartz).Gorissen, p. 53 His British friend Reginald Stanley Faber suggested he could write prose as well. Jozua Schwartz took the suggestion to heart. In 1889 he published two novels, both with Remington & Co and in English. The first one was a detective story entitled The Black Box Murder. With this book he was one of the first Dutch authors who wrote a detective story, albeit in English.Which was the first Dutch detective story? (in Dutch) The novel did not mention an author; the title page said: 'The Black Box Murder by the Man Who Discovered the Murderer'. The second book, The Sin of Joost Avelingh, was the first one he published under the nom de plume of Maarten Maartens. He chose that name because it sounded very Dutch, was easy to remember and for non-Dutch speakers also easy to pronounce. The Sin of Joost Avelingh was set in the Netherlands and depicted Dutch society. The book was a big success and went through several editions. The next year D. Appleton & Company printed an American edition. The book was translated into German, Danish, Italian, French and Dutch.Gorissen, p. 54 All subsequent books were published under the name of Maarten Maartens and in English, both in the UK and the US. In this way Maartens published fourteen novels and four books of short stories. Most books are set in the Netherlands. His best known novel is God's Fool (1892); he himself considered The Price of Lis Doris (1909) to be his best book.Gorissen, p. 56 Most of his books were translated into German, a few of them also into Dutch. None of the Dutch editions were successful. In both the UK and the US Maarten Maartens was a popular writer, whose novels went through several reprints. He regularly visited the UK and was on friendly terms with British writers like Thomas Hardy, George Meredith and George Bernard Shaw. Among his best friends were J.M. Barrie, Edmund Gosse and the publisher George Bentley. Bentley was in some respects Maartens's critical councillor. On receiving the first draft of The Greater Glory he advised Maartens to rewrite the second and third volumes, as Maartens too clearly showed his dislike of one of its characters, Count Rexelaer. Maartens followed Bentley's advice.Breuls, p. 31 Maartens's popularity in the UK is evident from the fact that he was elected an honorary member of the English Authors Club in 1891. In 1905 he received an honorary doctorship at the University of Aberdeen, together with Thomas Hardy.Breuls, p. 33 After 1905 the sales figures of Maartens's books started to decline. He still was a welcome guest in the Anglo-Saxon world though. In 1907 he visited the United States. He attended the opening of an enlargement to the Carnegie Museum of Art at Pittsburgh and on 12 April delivered a speech there. A few days later, on 15 April, he spoke at the New York Peace Congress, organised by Andrew Carnegie.The text of this speech has been included in The Letters of Maarten Maartens, pp. 254-258 Maartens had met Carnegie during his visits to the UK. Maartens was even received by President Theodore Roosevelt at the White House.Letters of Maarten Maartens, pp. 252-264; Breuls, p. 38 In 1914 the collected works of Maarten Maartens were published with Constable & Co. in London. A somewhat less complete edition was published with Tauchnitz in Leipzig in the series 'Tauchnitz Collection of British and American Authors' (in English!). D. Appleton & Company, his American publisher, refused to print an American edition. Maartens's books did not sell anymore.Breuls, p. 9 In the same year, 1914, Maarten Maartens published his only work in Dutch: a bundle of poems under the nom de plume of Joan van den Heuvel ('John of the Hill', a pun on 'Zonheuvel', the name of his castle). After the outbreak of the First World War and Maartens's death in 1915 the publishers lost interest in his work and he fell into oblivion. In 1930 though his daughter Ada van der Poorten Schwartz, who managed his literary estate, succeeded in having a selection of his letters published. Because he wrote all his works ‚Äì one collection of poems excepted ‚Äì in English, he was hardly known in his own country, the Netherlands. Among his compatriots, who had heard of him, but never read him, a rumour spread that his novels were romans √† clef and meant to ridicule the Netherlands. Maartens was annoyed by this rumour, as the preface to The Greater Glory (1894) clearly shows: :'Holland is a small country, and it is difficult to step out in it without treading on somebody‚Äôs toes. I therefore wish to declare, once for all, and most emphatically, that my books contain no allusions, covert or overt, to any real persons, living or dead. I am aware that great masters of fiction have thought fit to work from models; that method must therefore possess its advantages: it is not mine.' But it was in the Netherlands where, after his death, some attempts were made to renew interest in his works. Since 1930 two novels and two short story books have been published in Dutch translations. None of them was successful, most likely because Maartens had remained unknown and unpopular in the Netherlands, while times had changed and readers with them. On 26 September 2015, in memory of Maarten Maartens' passing a hundred years ago, a symposium was held in the Maarten Maartens House in Doorn, The Netherlands, commemorating his writings and writer's life. This was accompanied by a number of activities, including a concert event in the Maartens Church in Doorn with singing and piano accompaniment based on Maartens' texts, directed by Jurriaan R√∂ntgen, grandson of the well-known German-Dutch composer, Julian R√∂ntgen, and a member of the Schwartz family. The Dutch translation of God's Fool was reprinted and Bouwe Postmus presented his book, \\"At Home and Abroad; Stories of Love,\\" a collection of Maarten's short stories published by the author in well-known magazines. For that same occasion, his nephew, John Schwartz, published his book, \\"Maarten Maartens Rediscovered - The Most Popular Dutch Author Abroad,\\" which contains summarizations of Maartens' thirteen novels, with quotations from Maartens' writing. A year later, in 2016, Schwartz published the second part, \\"Maarten Maartens Rediscovered - His Best Short Stories,\\" a summarization with quotations of thirty-two short stories selected from Maartens' four published volumes of short stories, as well as The Black Box Murder, Maartens' first self-published detective.

Biography Law was born in Avon, Utah, and raised on a ranch and farm. He married Leda Ethelyn Call in 1925 in Logan, Utah, and they had five children. While in Logan, Law graduated from Brigham Young College and Utah State Agricultural College, receiving his bachelor's degree in history and education. He later attended the University of Southern California (USC) where he received a master's degree in education and educational administration, followed by an Ed.D. in teacher education in 1941. Law's career began as an elementary school principal in Box Elder County, Utah. After teaching some high school, he became the first principal at the consolidated South Rich High School in Randolph, Utah. After one year, he became the county superintendent, here he served for six years in the 1930s. He then briefly served as superintendent in Duchesne County School District before joining the faculty at Brigham Young University (BYU) in 1936. Law was appointed dean of BYU's college of education from 1946 to 1954. Church College of Hawaii Three years after becoming president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), David O. McKay decided that the church would establish a college in Hawaii. Although Law had just finished building a new home in Provo, Utah, he accepted the invitation plan the new school and be its first president and \\"turn President McKay's vision into a reality.\\" Eric B. Shumway, BYU‚ÄìHawaii's president fifty years later, said Law was \\"a man of strong character, [who] wielded a firm hand\\" and held an \\"absolute and fervent testimony of President McKay's calling as a prophet, seer, and revelator\\". Some contemporaries also saw him as a strict or authoritarian figure. With no preexisting facilities, Law led the survey committee to investigate potential attendance and locations. Although Law recommended the school begin in Fall 1956 in Honolulu, the population center, McKay decided it should be on church-owned property in Laie, and open soon as possible, in September 1955. In the complex work of urgently organizing a new junior college \\"from scratch\\", Law was given \\"direct access to President McKay on nearly all matters concerning the college, including budget, thus bypassing much of the bureaucracy and red tape of the church\\". Law had some private conflicts with Frank Woolley and the LDS Church's Pacific Board of Education about acquiring resources and the scope of academic programs. The school began in temporary buildings with 20 faculty and 153 students, which rose to 250 students by the end of Law's term. Law resigned in 1959 to accept a position in Southern California, and he was replaced by prolific faculty member Richard Wootton. Later activities In the 1970s, Law served on the Utah State Board of Education, which he chaired in 1976 to 1977. He was also a temple worker in the Provo Temple in the 1970s. In the LDS Church, Law served as a bishop, a counselor in a stake presidency, and a member of the church's Sunday School General Board. Law's wife Leda died in 1973. Later that year he married Lue Groesbeck. In 1981, Law died at the age of 78 in Provo and was buried in Logan. Writings *. *.

During the Greek campaign Xerxes developed a passionate desire for the wife of Masistes, but she would constantly resist and would not bend to his will. Upon his return to Sardis, the king endeavoured to bring about the marriage of his son Daris to Artaynte, the daughter of this woman the wife of Masistes, supposing that by doing so he could obtain her more easily. After moving to Susa he brought Artaynte to the royal house with him for his son Daris, but fell in love with her himself, and after obtaining her they became lovers. At the behest of Xerxes, Artaynte committed adultery with him (Xerxes). When queen Amestris found out, she did not seek revenge against Artaynte, but against her mother, Masistes' wife, as Amestris thought that it was her connivance.

Morocco had become a French protectorate in 1912, and Resident- General Louis-Hubert Lyautey sought to extend French influence eastwards through the Middle Atlas mountains towards French Algeria. This was opposed by the Zaians, led by Mouha ou Hammou Zayani. The war began well for the French, who quickly took the key towns of Taza and Kh√©nifra. Despite the loss of their base at Kh√©nifra, the Zaians inflicted heavy losses on the French, who responded by establishing groupes mobiles, combined arms formations that mixed regular and irregular infantry, cavalry and artillery into a single force. The outbreak of the First World War proved significant, with the withdrawal of troops for service in France compounded by the loss of more than 600 French killed at the Battle of El Herri. Lyautey reorganised his available forces into a \\"living barricade\\", consisting of outposts manned by his best troops protecting the perimeter of French territory with lower quality troops manning the rear-guard positions. Over the next four years the French retained most of their territory despite intelligence and financial support provided by the Central Powers to the Zaian Confederation and continual raids and skirmishes reducing scarce French manpower. After the signing of the Armistice with Germany in November 1918, significant forces of tribesmen remained opposed to French rule. The French resumed their offensive in the Kh√©nifra area in 1920, establishing a series of blockhouses to limit the Zaians' freedom of movement. They opened negotiations with Hammou's sons, persuading three of them, along with many of their followers, to submit to French rule. A split in the Zaian Confederation between those who supported submission and those still opposed led to infighting and the death of Hammou in Spring 1921. The French responded with a strong, three-pronged attack into the Middle Atlas that pacified the area. Some tribesmen, led by Moha ou Said, fled to the High Atlas and continued a guerrilla war against the French well into the 1930s. Origins alt=A photograph of General Mangin entering Marrakesh through a large gate at the head of a column of French horsemen The signing of the Treaty of Fez in 1912 established a French protectorate over Morocco.. The treaty had been prompted by the Agadir Crisis of 1911, during which French and Spanish troops had been sent to Morocco to put down a rebellion against Sultan Abdelhafid. The new French protectorate was led by a resident-general, Louis-Hubert Lyautey, and adopted the traditional Moroccan way of governing through the tribal system. Upon taking up his post Lyautey replaced Abdelhafid with his brother, Yusef.. The tribes took offence at this, installing their own Sultan, Ahmed al-Hiba, in Marrakesh and taking eight Europeans captive. Lyautey acted quickly against the revolt, dispatching General Charles Mangin and 5,000 troops to retake the town. Mangin's men were highly successful, rescuing the captives and inflicting heavy casualties on vastly superior numbers of tribesmen for the loss of 2 men killed and 23 wounded. Al-Hiba escaped to the Atlas mountains with a small number of his followers and opposed French rule until his death in 1919.. alt=A portrait of General Lyautey in military uniform, seated at a small table A popular idea among the public in France was to possess an unbroken stretch of territory from Tunis to the Atlantic Ocean, including expansion into the \\"Taza corridor\\" in the Moroccan interior.. Lyautey was in favour of this and advocated French occupation of the Middle Atlas mountains near Taza, through peaceful means where possible.. This French expansion into the Middle Atlas was strongly opposed by the \\"powerful Berber trinity\\" of Mouha ou Hammou Zayani, leader of the Zaian Confederation; Moha ou Said, leader of the A√Øt Ouirra; and Ali Amhaouch, a religious leader of the Darqawa variant of Islam prevalent in the region... Hammou commanded between 4,000 and 4,200 tents of people and had led the Zaians since 1877, opposing the French since the start of their involvement in Morocco.. An enemy of the French following their deposing of Sultan Abdelhafid, who was married to Hammou's daughter, he had declared a holy war against them and intensified his tribe's attacks on pro-French (or \\"submitted\\") tribes and military convoys.. Said was an old man, who was held in good standing by tribesmen across the region and had formerly been a ca√Ød (a local governor with almost absolute power) for the Moroccan government, even serving in the army of Sultan Abdelaziz against a pretender at Taza in 1902.... Despite initially being open to negotiations with the French, pressure from pro-war chiefs and the fear of ridicule from his tribesmen had dissuaded him... Amhaouch was a strong and influential man, described by French officer and explorer Ren√© de Segonzac as one of the \\"great spiritual leaders of Morocco\\" and the \\"most powerful religious personality of the south east\\". The French had attempted to persuade the Zaians to submit since 1913 with little success; most tribes in the confederation remained opposed to French rule.. Lyautey's plans for taking Taza also extended to capturing Kh√©nifra, Hammou's headquarters. He had been advised by his political officer, Maurice Le Glay that doing so would \\"finish him off definitively\\" and cut the Zaians off from support of other tribes. The French outpost at nearby Kasbah Tadla had recently been attacked by Said and subsequent peace negotiations led by Lyautey's head of intelligence, Colonel Henri Simon, had achieved little.. As a result, Mangin was authorised to lead a retaliatory raid to Said's camp at El Ksiba but, despite inflicting heavy casualties, was forced to withdraw with the loss of 60 killed, 150 wounded and much equipment abandoned. Having failed to make any impression on the Zaians through negotiation in May 1914, Lyautey authorised General Paul Prosper Henrys to take command of all French troops in the area and launch an attack on Taza and Kh√©nifra. Henrys captured Taza within a few days using units drawn from garrisons in Fez, Meknes, Rabat and Marrakesh and then turned his attention to Kh√©nifra.. Kh√©nifra campaign alt=A map showing the settlements and French outposts to the north-west of Kh√©nifra and the route of three French columns approaching the town from the west, north and east Henrys planned his assault on Kh√©nifra to begin on 10 June 1914 with the dispatch of three columns of troops, totalling 14,000 men equipped with wireless radios and supported by reconnaissance aircraft. One column was to set out from Meknes under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Henri Claudel, another from Rabat under Lieutenant-Colonel Gaston Cros and the third from Kasbah Tadla under Colonel No√´l Garnier-Duplessix.. Henrys took overall command, directing the forces from an armoured car within the Claudel column. Aware that he knew little of the terrain or the allegiance of local tribes Henrys offered a generous set of terms for tribesmen who submitted to French rule: they would have to surrender only their rapid firing rifles and any captured French supplies, and pay a small tax in return for protection. He also set aside substantial funds to bribe informants and tribal leaders. Despite these measures, Claudel's column came under attack before it even left Meknes, although it was the largest and intended as a diversion.. Hammou's forces attacked their camp on three separate nights, inflicting losses of at least one officer and four men killed and nineteen injured, but leaving the other two columns unopposed. Claudel launched a counterattack on 10 June while Hammou was preparing a fourth attack, sweeping the Zaians away with artillery and ensuring little resistance for his march to Kh√©nifra on the next day. After enduring some sniping attacks in Teguet, Claudel's cavalry crossed the Oum er Rbia at el Bordj and advanced to the outskirts of Kh√©nifra. The rest of the column joined them on 12 June, fighting off Zaian attacks on the way and meeting up with the other two columns, finding the town emptied of people and raising the French flag. The column had lost two men killed in the march. alt=Rolling hills with mountains in the background, a road and electricity pylons cross the image from left to right. The ground is stony with some browned grass, a few bushes and scattered trees. A small farm is in the right mid-ground with some fields used for hay and grazing of sheep. The columns experienced repeated, strong attacks by Zaian tribesmen that day, repelled by late afternoon at the cost of five men killed and nineteen wounded. Further attacks on the nights of 14 and 15 June were repulsed by artillery and machine gun fire, directed by searchlights.. Henrys then dispatched two columns south to the Zaian stronghold of Adersan to burn houses, proving his military abilities but not provoking a decisive confrontation with the tribes, who returned to guerrilla warfare tactics. In response all French-controlled markets were closed to the Zaians and their trade convoys were intercepted. Henrys became aware of a Zaian presence at el Bordj and sent a column to attack them on 31 June. South of el Bordj the French came under heavy fire from tribesmen with modern rifles and resorted to bayonet charges to clear the way. The encounter was Henrys' first major engagement with the Zaians and his losses were high, 1 officer and 16 men killed and a further 2 officers and 75 men wounded.. Zaian losses were much higher: the French counted at least 140 dead remaining on the battlefield, and considered the battle a victory. Henrys expected a pause in activity while the Zaians recovered, but instead Hammou stepped up attacks on the French. Just four days later an attack on a French convoy by 500 mounted tribesmen was only repulsed after several hours by more bayonet charges. French losses were again significant with one officer and ten men killed and thirty men wounded. Groupes mobiles alt=A painting of a column of black soldiers and porters accompanied by a white French officer In light of the increased attacks in the Kh√©nifra area Henrys established three groupes mobiles, made up of troops mostly drawn from the Army of Africa.. Each groupe was designed to be highly mobile and typically consisted of several battalions of regular infantry (Algerian and Senegalese Tirailleurs or French Foreign Legion troops), a squadron of cavalry (Algerian Spahis), a few batteries of artillery (field or mountain), a section of Hotchkiss machine guns and a mule train for supplies under the overall leadership of a French senior officer.. In addition each groupe mobile would have one or two goums (informal groups of around 200 men) of goumiers, irregular tribal auxiliaries, under the leadership of a French intelligence officer.. The goums were used for intelligence gathering operations and in areas of difficult terrain. A four-battalion-strong groupe mobile was established at Kh√©nifra, under Lieutenant-Colonel Ren√© Laverdure; one based to the west under Claudel and one to the east under Garnier-Duplessix. In addition fortified posts were established at M'Rirt and Sidi Lamine with the areas between patrolled by goumiers to protect convoys and submitted tribes from attack. Increasing attacks on Kh√©nifra throughout July, repelled only by concentrated artillery and machine gun fire, left Henrys concerned that a combined force of tribesmen could threaten the town and the submitted tribes.. This fear was partially allayed by the separate defeats of Hammou and Amhaouch by the groupes mobiles of Claudel and Garnier-Duplessix and by increasing numbers of auxiliaries becoming available from newly submitted tribes through the levy system. Claudel and Garnier-Duplessix were ordered to patrol the French bank of the Oum er Rbia and attempt to separate the Zaians from the Chleuh to the south while Henrys planned for an advance through the Middle Atlas to the Guigou River.. These operations were halted by the reduction in forces imposed on him by the outbreak of the First World War in Europe. First World War Lyautey received orders from Army headquarters in Paris on 28 July 1914 the day the First World War began, requesting the dispatch of all available troops to France in anticipation of a German invasion and the withdrawal of his remaining forces to more defensible coastal enclaves.. The French government justified this stance by stating that the \\"fate of Morocco will be determined in Lorraine\\".. Lyautey, who had lost most of his own possessions when his house in Cr√©vic had been burnt to the ground by advancing German forces, was keen to support the defence of France and within a month had sent 37 infantry and cavalry battalions and six artillery batteries to the Western Front ‚Äì more than had been requested of him.. A further 35,000 Moroccan labourers were recruited by Lyautey over the course of the war for service in France.. alt=A black and white line drawing of a bayonet charge of Senegalese soldiers led by a French officer Nevertheless, Lyautey did not wish to abandon the inland territory his men had fought so hard for, stating that if he withdrew \\"such a shock would result immediately all over Morocco ... that a general revolt would arise under our feet, on all our points\\". Left with just 20 battalions of legionnaires (mainly German and Austrian), military criminals of the Infanterie L√©g√®re d'Afrique, territorial reservists, Senegalese Tirailleurs and goumiers, he switched from the offensive to a long-term strategy of \\"active defence\\".. Lyautey withdrew all non-essential personnel from his rear garrisons, brought in elderly reservists from France and issued weapons and elements of military dress to civilians in an attempt to convince the tribes that the French army in Morocco was as strong as before.. Lyautey referred to this move as similar to hollowing out a lobster while leaving the shell intact. His plan depended on holding a \\"living barricade\\" of French outposts running from Taza in the north through Khenifra, Kasbah Tadla and Marrakesh to Agadir on the Atlantic coast. Lyautey and Henrys intended to hold the Berbers in their current positions until they had sufficient resources to return to the offensive. The recent French advances and troop withdrawals had left Kh√©nifra badly exposed and from 4 August ‚Äì the day two battalions of infantry left the garrison for France ‚Äì the Zaian tribes launched a month-long attack on the town, supply convoys and withdrawing French troops \\"without interruption\\". Lyautey was determined to hold Kh√©nifra to use as a bridgehead for further expansion of French territory and referred to it as a bastion against the \\"hostile Berber masses\\" upon which the \\"maintenance of [his] occupation\\" depended. Attacks on Kh√©nifra threatened the vital communication corridor between French forces in Morocco and those in Algeria. To relieve pressure on the town, Claudel and Garnier-Duplessix's groupes mobiles engaged Hammou and Amhaouch's forces at Mahajibat, Bou Moussa and Bou Arar on 19, 20 and 21 August, inflicting \\"considerable losses\\". This, combined with the reinforcement of Khenifra on 1 September, led to reduced attacks, decreasing to a state of \\"armed peace\\" by November. alt=A party of German prisoners works the ground with picks under the supervision of a French guards Henrys began to move towards a more offensive posture, ordering mobile columns to circulate through the Middle Atlas and mounted companies to patrol the plains. This was part of his plan to maintain pressure on Hammou, who he considered to be the linchpin of the \\"artificial\\" Zaian Confederation and responsible for their continued resistance.. Henrys was counting on the onset of winter to force the Zaians from the mountains to their lowland pastures where they could be confronted or persuaded to surrender. In some cases the war assisted Lyautey, allowing him a freer hand in his overall strategy, greater access to finance and the use of at least 8,000 German prisoners of war to construct essential infrastructure... In addition the increased national pride led many middle- aged French immigrants in Morocco to enlist in the army and, though they were of poor fighting quality, Lyautey was able to use these men to maintain the appearance of a large force under his command.. Battle of El Herri alt=A river runs across the image from left to right with a town in the background, behind a concrete flood defence. The foreground shows a stony, sparsely vegetated river bank. When Henrys had successfully repulsed the attacks on Kh√©nifra, he believed he had the upper hand, having proven that the reduced French forces could resist the tribesmen.. The Zaians were now contained within a triangle formed by the Oum er Rbia River, the Serrou River and the Atlas Mountains, and were already in dispute with neighbouring tribes over the best wintering land. Hammou decided to winter at the small village of El Herri, from Kh√©nifra, and established a camp of around 100 tents there. Hammou had been promised peace talks by the French, and Lyautey twice refused Laverdure permission to attack him and ordered him to remain on the French bank of the Oum er Rbia.. On 13 November Laverdure decided to disobey these orders and marched to El Herri with almost his entire force, some 43 officers and 1,187 men with supporting artillery and machine guns.. This amounted to less than half the force he had in September, when he had last been refused permission to attack.. Laverdure's force surprised the Zaian camp, mostly empty of fighting men, at dawn.. A French cavalry charge, followed up with infantry, successfully cleared the camp.. After capturing two of Hammou's wives and looting the tents the French started back for Kh√©nifra. The Zaians and other local tribes, eventually numbering 5,000 men, began to converge on the French column and began harassing its flanks and rear.. The French artillery proved ineffective against dispersed skirmishers and at the Chbouka river the rearguard and gun batteries found themselves cut off and overrun. Laverdure detached a small column of troops to take his wounded to Kh√©nifra, remaining behind with the rest of the force. Laverdure's remaining troops were surrounded by the Zaians and were wiped out by a mass attack of \\"several thousand\\" tribesmen. The wounded and their escort reached Khenifra safely by noon, narrowly outpacing their pursuers, who had stopped to loot the French dead. This force of 431 able-bodied men and 176 wounded were the only French survivors of the battle. The French lost 623 men on the battlefield, while 182 Zaian were killed.. The French troops also lost 4 machine guns, 630 small arms, 62 horses, 56 mules, all of their artillery and camping equipment and much of their personal belongings.. After El Herri alt=A square of French troops with fixed bayonets defends against a charge of mounted Moroccans The loss of the column at El Herri, the bloodiest defeat of a French force in Morocco, left Kh√©nifra almost undefended.. The senior garrison officer, Captain Pierre Kroll, had just three companies of men to protect the town. He managed to inform Lyautey and Henrys of the situation by telegraph before the town came under siege from the Zaians. Henrys determined to act quickly against the Zaians to prevent Laverdure's defeat from jeopardising the French presence in Morocco, dispatching Garnier-Duplessix's groupe mobile to Kh√©nifra and forming another groupe in support at Ito under Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph D√©rigoin. Garnier-Duplessix fought his way to the town, relieved it on 16 November, and was joined by Henrys shortly afterwards. The 6th battalion of the 2nd French Foreign Legion Regiment also reached the town, having fought off Zaian attacks during their march from M'Rirt. Henrys led excursions from Kh√©nifra to El Herri as a show of force and to bury their dead, some of whom had been taken as trophies by Hammou to encourage support from other tribes. The Zaian victory at El Herri, combined with slow French progress on the Western Front and the siding of the Muslim Ottoman Empire with the Central Powers, led to an increase in recruits for the tribes and greater co-operation between Hammou, Amhaouch and Said.. To counter this Henrys undertook a reorganisation of his forces, forming three military districts centred on Fez, Meknes and Tadla-Zaian (the Kh√©nifra region), the latter under the command of Garnier-Duplessix. Henrys aimed to maintain pressure on Hammou through an economic blockade and the closure of markets to unsubmitted tribes. He imposed a war penalty, in the form of money, horses and rifles, on submitting tribes, believing that their submission would last only if they paid for it.. Few tribes took up Henrys' offer and the Zaians continued to cross the Rbia and attack French patrols. The French returned to the offensive in March with D√©rigoin's group sweeping along the French bank of the Rbia, north of Kh√©nifra, and Garnier-Duplessix the left. D√©rigoin faced and drove off only a small Zaian force, but Garnier-Duplessix faced a more significant force ‚Äì his troops were almost overrun by a large mounted group but managed to repulse them, inflicting \\"serious losses\\" in return for French casualties of one man killed and eight wounded. Garnier-Duplessix crossed the Rbia again in May to confiscate crops, and was attacked there by a force of 4‚Äì5,000 tribesmen at Sidi Sliman, near Kasbah Tadla... He repulsed them with artillery and counterattacked successfully over the course of a two-day engagement, killing 300 of the attackers and wounding 400 at the cost of 3 French dead and 5 wounded. This victory restored the image of French superiority and led to an increase in tribal submissions, the withdrawal of Said's forces further into the mountains and a six-month period of relative peace. In recognition of this Garnier-Duplessix was promoted to major-general. The peace was broken on 11 November 1915 by an attack on a supply convoy headed for Kh√©nifra by 1,200‚Äì1,500 Zaians and allied tribesmen. The Moroccans pressed to within of the French, and Garnier-Duplessix, in command of the convoy, was forced to resort to the bayonet to push them back. French casualties amounted to just 3 killed and 22 wounded but Henrys was concerned by the influence that Hammou continued to hold over other Berber tribes. In retaliation Henrys took both groupes mobiles across the Rbia and bombarded the Zaian camp, inflicting casualties but making little impression on their will to fight.. The Zaians recrossed the Rbia in January 1916, camping in French territory and raiding the submitted tribes. Feeling that his communications with Taza were threatened Henrys withdrew his groupes to the Kh√©nifra area, both of them coming under attack en route. At M'Rirt a sizeable Zaian attack was repulsed with 200 casualties but the French suffered the loss of one officer and 24 men killed and 56 wounded. alt=Mounted French goumiers running down Moroccan tribesmen mounted and on foot Lyautey had successfully retained the territory he had captured before the war but was of the opinion that he could not advance any further without risking \\"an extremely painful\\" mountain conflict. He faced having his troops withdrawn for service on the Western Front and being left with what he described as \\"degenerates and outcasts\\", a loss only partially mitigated by the expansion of the irregular tribal units to 21 goums in strength... Henrys accepted an offer of a position in France and was replaced by Colonel Joseph-Fran√ßois Poeymirau, a keen follower of Lyautey who had served as Henrys' second in command at Meknes.. Lyautey was offered the post of Minister of War at the invitation of Prime Minister Aristide Briand, which he accepted on 12 December 1916.. Lyautey was replaced, at his request, by General Henri Gouraud, who had experience fighting alongside Lyautey in Morocco and who had recently returned from the Dardanelles, where he had lost his right arm.. Lyautey soon became disillusioned with French tactics in Europe, the disunity prevailing between the Allies and his position as a symbolic figurehead of the government.. He was unfamiliar with dealing with political opposition and resigned on 14 March 1917, after being shouted down in the Chamber of Deputies.. The government could not survive the resignation of such a senior cabinet member and Briand himself resigned on 17 March, to be replaced by Alexandre Ribot. Lyautey returned to his former position in Morocco at the end of May and immediately decided on a new strategy. He concentrated his forces in the Moulouya Valley, convinced that the submission of the tribes in this area would lead to the collapse of the Zaian resistance.. In preparation for this new offensive Poeymirau established a French post at El Bekrit, within Zaian territory, and forced the submission of three local tribes. He then used this post to protect his flanks during an advance south-eastwards into the valley, intending to meet with a column led by Colonel Paul Doury, advancing north-west from Boudenib.. The two columns met at Assaka Nidji on 6 June, a moment which represented the establishment of the first French-controlled route across the Atlas mountains, and earned Poeymirau promotion to brigadier-general.. A defensive camp was soon established at Kasbah el Makhzen, and Doury began construction on a road that he promised would be traversable by motor transport by 1918. By late 1917 motorised lorries were able to traverse much of the road, allowing the French to quickly move troops to areas of trouble and supply their garrisons in eastern Morocco from the west rather than over long routes from the Algerian depots. A secondary road was constructed, leading southwards from the first along the Ziz River, that allowed Doury to reach Er-Rich in the High Atlas, and major posts were established at Midelt and Missour. The Zaians refused to be drawn into attacking the fortified posts that the French built along their new roads, though other tribes launched attacks that summer after rumours of French defeats on the European front. In one instance, in mid-June, it took Poeymirau's entire groupe three days to restore control of the road after an attack. Doury had expanded the theatre of operations, against Lyautey's orders, by establishing a French mission at Tighmart, in the Tafilalt region, in December 1917 in reaction to a rumoured German presence there. The land here, mainly desert, was almost worthless to the French and Lyautey was keen for his subordinates to focus on the more valuable Moulouya Valley.. Local tribes resisted the French presence, killing a translator working at the mission in July 1918. Doury sought to avenge this act on 9 August by engaging up to 1,500 tribesmen, led by Sidi Mhand n'Ifrutant, at Gaouz with a smaller French force that included artillery and aircraft support.. Entering a thick, jungle-like date palm oasis, one subgroup of Doury's force suffered a close, hard-fought action, hampered by exhaustion and poor supply lines.. The whole force suffered casualties of 238 men killed and 68 wounded, the worst French losses since the disaster at El Herri, and also lost much of their equipment and transport.. Lyautey was doubtful of Doury's claim to have almost wiped out his foe, and in response chastised him for his rash action in \\"this most peripheral of zones\\" and placed him under Poeymirau's direct command. Thus, as the war in Europe was drawing to a close in the early summer of 1918, the French remained hard pressed in Morocco. Despite the death of Ali Amhaouch by natural causes, significant numbers of tribesmen under the leadership of Hammou and Said continued to oppose them. The Central Powers in Morocco alt=Sultan Abdelhafid seated on a settee behind a table The Central Powers attempted to incite unrest in the Allied territories in Africa and the Middle East during the war, with the aim of diverting military resources away from the Western Front.. German intelligence had identified Northwest Africa as the \\"Achilles' heel\\" of the French colonies, and encouraging resistance there became an important objective.. Their involvement began in 1914, with the Germans attempting to find a suitable Moroccan leader that they could use to unite the tribes against the French.. Their initial choice, former Sultan Abdelaziz, refused to co-operate and moved to the south of France to prevent any further approaches. Instead they entered negotiations with his successor Abdelhafid. He initially co-operated with the Germans, renouncing his former pro-Allied stance in autumn 1914 and moving to Barcelona to meet with officials from Germany, the Ottoman Empire and the Moroccan resistance.. During this time he was also selling information to the French. These mixed loyalties came to light when he refused to board a German submarine headed for Morocco, and the Central Powers decided he was of no further use. Abdelhafid then attempted to extort money from the French intelligence services, who responded by halting his pension and arranging his internment at El Escorial. He was later awarded a stipend by Germany in return for his silence on the matter. The failure to find a suitable leader caused the Germans to alter their plans from a widespread insurrection in Morocco to smaller-scale support of the existing resistance movement. German support included the supply of military advisers and Foreign Legion deserters to the tribes as well as cash, arms and ammunition.. Money (in both pesetas and francs) was smuggled into Morocco from the German embassy at Madrid.. The money was transferred to T√©touan or Melilla by boat or wired through the telegraph before being smuggled to the tribes, who each received up to 600,000 pesetas per month. Weapons arrived through long-established routes from Spanish Larache or else purchased directly from French gun runners or corrupt Spanish Army troops.. The Germans found it hard to get resources to the Zaians in the Middle Atlas due to the distances involved and most of what did get through went to Said's forces.. German attempts to distribute supplies inland were frustrated when many tribes hoarded the best resources.. Ammunition remained scarce in the Middle Atlas, and many were forced to rely on locally manufactured gunpowder and cartridges. The Ottoman Empire also supported the Moroccan tribesmen in this period, having provided military training to them since 1909.. They co- operated with German intelligence to write and distribute propaganda in Arabic, French and the Middle Atlas Berber dialect.. Much of the Ottoman intelligence effort was coordinated by Arab agents operating from the embassy in Madrid and at least two members of the Ottoman diplomatic staff there are known to have seen active service with the tribes in Morocco during the war.. Ottoman efforts in Morocco were hindered by internal divisions among the staff, disagreements with their German allies and the outbreak of the Arab Revolt in 1916, with which some of the embassy staff sympathised. These problems led many of the Ottoman diplomatic corps in Spain to leave for America in September 1916, bringing to an end many of the significant Ottoman operations in Morocco.. Poster advertising the 1915 Casablanca Fair French intelligence forces worked hard to combat the Central Powers and to win the support of the Moroccan people. A series of commercial expositions, such as the Casablanca Fair of 1915, were held to demonstrate the wealth of France and the benefits of co-operation.. In addition to stepping up their propaganda campaign and increasing the use of bribes to convince tribes to submit, the French established markets at their military outposts and paid Moroccans to undertake public works. Islamic scholars were also encouraged to issue fatwƒÅs supporting the Moroccan Sultan's declaration of independence from the Ottoman Empire.. French and British intelligence agents co-operated in French and Spanish Morocco and Gibraltar, tracking Ottoman and German agents, infiltrating the advisers sent to the tribes and working to halt the flow of arms.. German citizens in Morocco were placed under careful scrutiny and four were executed within days of the war's start.. The French broke the codes used by the German embassy and were able to read almost every communication sent from there to the General Staff in Berlin. Bribes paid to staff at the Ottoman mission to Spain secured intelligence on the Central Powers' plans for Morocco. Although the efforts of the Central Powers caused a resurgence in resistance against French rule, they were largely ineffective, falling short of the planners' aims of a widespread jihad... There were few cases of mass civil disorder, France was not required to reinforce the troops stationed in Morocco, and the export of raw materials and labour for the war effort continued. Although they were never able to completely stem the flow of arms, despite considerable effort, the French were able to limit the supply of machine guns and artillery.. The tribes were thus unable to face the French in direct confrontation and had to continue to rely on ambushes and raids. This contrasted with the Spanish experience in the Rif War of 1920‚Äì26, in which tribes with access to such weapons were able to inflict defeats upon the Spanish Army in the field, such as at the Battle of Annual. Post-war conflicts alt=Thami El Glaoui in traditional tribal clothing with a dagger at his hip The heavy French losses at the Battle of Gaouz encouraged an increase in tribal activity across the south-east of Morocco, threatening the French presence at Boudenib.. Poeymirau was forced to withdraw garrisons from outlying posts in the Tafilalt, including that at Tighmart, to concentrate his force and reduce the risk of further disasters. Lyautey authorised only a series of limited offensives, such as the razing of villages and gardens, the primary aim of which was to emphasise French military superiority.. The French struggled to move troops through the mountain passes from the Moulouya Valley due to heavy snows and attacks on their columns, and Lyautey, to his embarrassment, was forced to request reinforcements from Algeria. By October the situation had stabilised to the extent that Poeymirau was able to withdraw his troops to Meknes, but a large-scale uprising in January 1919 forced his return. Poeymirau defeated n'Ifrutant in battle at Meski on 15 January, but was seriously wounded in the chest by the accidental explosion of an artillery shell and was forced to hand command to Colonel Antoine Hur√©. Lyautey then received assistance from Thami El Glaoui, a tribal leader who Lyautey had made Pasha of Marrakesh after the uprising of 1912.. El Glaoui owed his increasing wealth (when he died in 1956 he was one of the richest men in the world) to corruption and fraud, which the French tolerated in return for his support.. Thus committed to Lyautey's cause, El Glaoui led an army of 10,000 men, the largest Moroccan tribal force ever seen, across the Atlas to defeat anti- French tribesmen in the Dad√®s Gorges and to reinforce the garrison at Boudenib on 29 January. The uprising was over by 31 January 1919. left The conflict in the Tafilalt distracted the French from their main war aims, draining French reinforcements in return for little economic gain and drawing comparisons to the recent Battle of Verdun. Indeed, the Zaians were encouraged by French losses in the area to renew their attacks on guardposts along the trans-Atlas road. The French continued to hope for a negotiated end to the conflict and had been in discussions with Hammou's close relatives since 1917. Indeed, his nephew, Ou El Aidi, had offered his submission in exchange for weapons and money but had been refused by the French who suspected he wanted to fight with his cousin, Hammou's son, Hassan. With no progress in these negotiations Poeymirau moved against the tribes to the north and south of Kh√©nifra in 1920, the front in this area having remained static for six years.. Troops were brought in from Tadla and Meknes to establish blockhouses and mobile reserves along the Rbia to prevent the Zaians crossing to use the pastures. The French were opposed vigorously but eventually established three blockhouses and forced some of the local tribes to submit. French successes in the Kh√©nifra region persuaded Hassan and his two brothers to submit to the French on 2 June 1920, having returned some of the equipment captured at El Herri... Hassan was soon appointed Pasha of Kh√©nifra and his 3,000 tents were brought under French protection in an expanded zone of occupation around the Rbia. alt=French and Moroccan men crowd around the central figures of Hassan and Poeymirau, standing in discussion Following the submission of his sons, Hammou retained command of only 2,500 tents and in Spring 1921 was killed in a skirmish with other Zaian tribes that opposed continued resistance. The French seized the opportunity to launch an assault on the last bastion of Zaian resistance, located near El Bekrit. In September a three-pronged attack was made: General Jean Th√©veney moved west from the El Bekrit settlement, Colonel Henry Freydenberg moved east from Taka Ichian and a third group of submitted tribesmen under Hassan and his brothers also took part.. Th√©veney encountered resistance from the Zaians in his area but Freydenberg was almost unopposed and within days all resistance was put down. After seven years of fighting the Zaian War was ended, though Lyautey continued his expansion in the area, promising to have all of \\"useful Morocco\\" under French control by 1923.. Lyautey had been granted the dignity of a Marshal of France in 1921 in recognition of his work in Morocco.. Map depicting the staged pacification of Morocco through to 1934 In Spring 1922, Poeymirau and Freydenberg launched attacks into the headwaters of the Moulouya in the western Middle Atlas and managed to defeat Said, the last surviving member of the Berber triumvirate, at El Ksiba in April 1922.. Said was forced to flee, with much of the A√Øt Ichkern tribe, to the highest mountains of the Middle Atlas and then into the High Atlas.. Lyautey then secured the submission of several more tribes, constructed new military posts and improved his supply roads; by June 1922, he had brought the entire Moulouya Valley under control and pacified much of the Middle Atlas. Limited in numbers by rapid post-war demobilisation and commitments to garrisons in Germany, he determined not to march through the difficult terrain of the High Atlas but to wait for the tribes to tire of the guerrilla war and submit.. Said never did so, dying in action against a groupe mobile in March 1924, though his followers continued to cause problems for the French into the next decade.. Pacification of the remaining tribal areas in French Morocco was completed in 1934, though small armed gangs of bandits continued to attack French troops in the mountains until 1936... Moroccan opposition to French rule continued, a plan for reform and return to indirect rule was published by the nationalist Comit√© d'Action Marocaine (CAM) in 1934, with significant riots and demonstrations occurring in 1934, 1937, 1944 and 1951... France, having failed to quell the nationalists by deposing the popular Sultan Mohammed V and already fighting a bloody war of independence in Algeria, recognised Moroccan independence in 1956.

How Capitalism Underdeveloped Black America: Problems in Race, Political Economy, and Society. Boston: South End Press, p. 72. It included coerced sexual relations between enslaved men and women, forced pregnancies of enslaved people, and favoring women who could produce a relatively large number of children. The objective was to increase the number of enslaved people without incurring the cost of purchase, and to fill labor shortages caused by the termination of the Atlantic slave trade.Davis, David Brion (2014) \\"Slavery, Sex, and Dehumanization.\\" In Gwyn Campbell and Elizabeth Elbourne's Sex, Power, and Slavery. Athens, OH: Ohio University Press, pp. 51-53.  Historical context   End of the American slave trade  Slaves dancing on a South Carolina plantation. The Old Plantation, c. 1790. The laws that ultimately ended the Atlantic Slave Trade came about as a result of the efforts of abolitionist Christian groups such as the Society of Friends, known as Quakers, and Evangelicals led by William Wilberforce, whose efforts through the Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade led to the passage of the Slave Trade Act by the British Parliament in 1807.Finkelman, Paul and Joseph C. Miller, eds. (1998) Macmillan Encyclopedia of World Slavery, Vol. 2. New York: Simon & Schuster. This led to increased calls for the same ban in America, supported by members of the U.S. Congress from both the North and the South as well as President Thomas Jefferson.Schneider, Dorothy and Carl J. Schneider (2000). Slavery in America from Colonial Times to the Civil War. New York: Facts on File, pp. 261-72. At the same time that the importation of slaves from Africa was being restricted or eliminated, the United States was undergoing a rapid expansion of cotton, sugar cane, and rice production in the Deep South and the West. Invention of the cotton gin enabled the profitable cultivation of short-staple cotton, which could be produced more widely than other types; this led to the economic preeminence of cotton throughout the Deep South. Slaves were treated as a commodity by owners and traders alike, and were regarded as the crucial labor for the production of lucrative cash crops that fed the triangle trade.Ira Berlin, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America, Cambridge, MA: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1998, pp. 95-101.David W. Galenson, Traders, Planters, and Slaves: Market Behavior in Early English America, 1986. The slaves were managed as chattel assets, similar to farm animals. Slave owners passed laws regulating slavery and the slave trade, designed to protect their financial investment. The enslaved workers had no more rights than a cow or a horse, or as famously put by the U.S. Supreme Court in the Dred Scott decision, \\"they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect\\". On large plantations, enslaved families were separated for different types of labor. Men tended to be assigned to large field gangs. Workers were assigned to the task for which they were best physically suited, in the judgment of the overseer.Dorothy Schneider and Carl J. Schneider, \\"Slavery in America from Colonial Times to the Civil War\\", Facts on File, 2000. pp. 52-56Ira Berlin, Many Thousands Gone, 1998, pp. 40-41; 129-32.  Breeding in response to end of slave imports  The prohibition on the importation of slaves into the United States after 1808 limited the supply of slaves in the United States. This came at a time when the invention of the cotton gin enabled the expansion of cultivation in the uplands of short-staple cotton, leading to clearing lands cultivating cotton through large areas of the Deep South, especially the Black Belt. The demand for labor in the area increased sharply and led to an expansion of the internal slave market. At the same time, the Upper South had an excess number of slaves because of a shift to mixed-crops agriculture, which was less labor-intensive than tobacco. To add to the supply of slaves, slaveholders looked at the fertility of slave women as part of their productivity, and intermittently forced the women to have large numbers of children. During this time period, the terms \\"breeders\\", \\"breeding slaves\\", \\"child bearing women\\", \\"breeding period\\", and \\"too old to breed\\" became familiar.Smith, Julia Floyd (1991) Slavery and Rice Culture in Low Country Georgia, 1750-1860 University of Tennessee Press, 104. Planters in the Upper South states started selling slaves to the Deep South, generally through slave traders such as Franklin and Armfield. Louisville, Kentucky, on the Ohio River was a major slave market and port for shipping slaves downriver by the Mississippi to the South. New Orleans had the largest slave market in the country and became the fourth largest city in the US by 1840 and the wealthiest, mostly because of its slave trade and associated businesses.Hornsby, Alton Jr. (2011) Black America: A State-by-State Historical Encyclopedia. Santa Barbara CA: Greenwood Press, p. 335. Slave accounts In the antebellum years, numerous escaped slaves wrote about their experiences in books called slave narratives. Many recounted that at least a portion of slave owners continuously interfered in the sexual lives of their slaves (usually the women). The slave narratives also testified that slave women were subjected to arranged marriages, forced matings, sexual violation by masters, their sons or overseers, and other forms of abuse. The historian E. Franklin Frazier, in his book The Negro Family, stated that \\"there were masters who, without any regard for the preferences of their slaves, mated their human chattel as they did their stock.\\" Ex-slave Maggie Stenhouse remarked, \\"Durin' slavery there were stockmen. They was weighed and tested. A man would rent the stockman and put him in a room with some young women he wanted to raise children from.\\"Work Projects Administration, Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews with Former Slaves, Arkansas Narratives, Part 6, Kessinger Publishing, 2004, p. 154.  Dynamics  Personhood to thinghood Several factors coalesced to make the breeding of slaves a common practice by the end of the 18th century, chief among them the enactment of laws and practices that transformed the view of slaves from \\"personhood\\" into \\"thinghood.\\" In this way, slaves could be bought and sold as chattel without presenting a challenge to the religious beliefs and social mores of the society at large. All rights were to the owner of the slave, with the slave having no rights of self-determination either to his or her own person, spouse, or children. Slaveholders began to think that slavery was grounded in the Bible. This view was inspired in part by a reinterpretation of the Genesis passage \\"Cursed be Canaan; The lowest of slaves shall he be to his brothers\\" (Genesis 9); Ham, son of Noah and father of Canaan, was deemed the antediluvian progenitor of the African people. Some whites used the Bible to justify the economic use of slave labor. The subjugation of slaves was taken as a natural right of the white slave owners. The second class position of the slave was not limited to his relationship with the slave master but was to be in relation to all whites. Slaves were considered subject to white persons.Eddie Donoghue, Black Breeding Machines: The Breeding of Negro Slaves in the Diaspora, AuthorHouse, 2008, pp. 134-36. Demographics In a study of 2,588 slaves in 1860 by the economist Richard Sutch, he found that on slave-holdings with at least one woman, the average ratio of women to men exceeded 2:1. The imbalance was greater in the \\"selling states\\", where the excess of women over men was 300 per thousand.Sutch, Richard, \\"The Breeding of Slaves for Sale and the Westward Expansion of Slavery, 1850-1860\\", in Stanley L. Engerman and Eugene Genovese (eds), Race and Slavery in the Western Hemishpere: Q Studies, Princeton University Press, 1975, pp. 173-210. Natural increase vs systematic breeding Ned Sublette, co-author of The American Slave Coast, states that the reproductive worth of \\"breeding women\\" was essential to the young country's expansion not just for labor but as merchandise and collateral stemming from a shortage of silver, gold, or sound paper tender. He concludes that slaves and their descendants were used as human savings accounts with newborns serving as interest that functioned as the basis of money and credit in a market premised on the continual expansion of slavery.Sublette, Ned and Constance Sublette (2016). American Slave Coast: A History of the Slave-Breeding Industry. Chicago IL: Chicago Review Press, p. 49. Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman reject the idea that systematic slave breeding was a major economic concern in their 1974 book Time on the Cross.Fogel, Robert; Engerman, Stanley (1995). Time on the Cross: The Economics of American Negro Slavery. New York: Norton, p. 78. They argue that there is very meager evidence for the systematic breeding of slaves for sale in the market in the Upper South during the 19th century. They distinguish systematic breeding‚Äîthe interference in normal sexual patterns by masters with an aim to increase fertility or encourage desirable characteristics‚Äîfrom pro-natalist policies, the generalized encouragement of large families through a combination of rewards, improved living and working conditions for fertile women and their children, and other policy changes by masters. They point out that the demographic evidence is subject to a number of interpretations. Fogel argues that when planters intervened in the private lives of slaves it actually had a negative impact on population growth.

This college drew the Health, Physical Education and Recreation Department from the College of Education; the Intercollegiate Athletics and Intramural Sports department also from the College of Education; and incorporated the newly formed Scouting Department. The Health, P.E. and Recreation Department was split into four departments, Recreation, Health and Safety, Women's Physical Education and Dance, and Men's Physical Education and Pre-physical Therapy. In 1956 Intercollegiate Athletics and Intramural Sports were split into two programs. These programs were eventually moved outside of the academic structure of BYU to be non-college affiliated parts of the university. The Department of Youth Leadership, originally the Department of Scouting, was founded at BYU by Royal Stone, who had served as a Boy Scouts of America executive. After being department head for four years, he left to return to employment with the Boy Scouts and was replaced by Thane Packer.Ernest L. Wilkinson and Leonard J. Arrington, ed., Brigham Young University: The First 100 Years. Vol. 3, p. 103-104 In 1960 the college's name was shortened to College of Physical Education. Prior to this the Scouting Department had been renamed first to Scouting Education and then to Youth Leadership. In 1963 the Health and Safety Department was renamed to Health and Safety Education. It was renamed again to Health Sciences in 1969. Later the men's and women's designations in Physical Education were dropped, and physical education classes merged into the same program as pre-physical therapy, while Dance became a separate department. At some point after 1997 the Physical Education Department was renamed the Exercise Science Department. At some point, the Recreation Education Department merged with the Youth Leadership Department. The BYU College of Health and Human Performance was divided into four departments: Dance, Exercise Sciences, Health Science, and Recreation Management and Youth Leadership. The Dance Department offers majors in Dance and Dance Education, with minors in Ballroom Dance, World Dance and Modern Dance. The Exercise Science program offers majors in Athletic Training, Exercise and Wellness, Exercise Science, and Physical Education Teaching/Coaching. Only the last of these can also be pursued as a minor. The health science program offers majors in public health and school health education. There is a minor in health education as well as one in driver safety education. The Recreational Management and Youth Leadership department offers a major with that name, with choices of emphasis in either leisure services management or therapeutic recreation. It also offers a minor in non-profit management.BYU College of Health and Human Performance website, accessed Dec. 15, 2010 The College of Health and Human Performance was disbanded in 2009.

The character first appeared on-screen on 13 October 2009 in the episode \\"The Spirit Dancing\\" - series eleven, episode fifty-two of the programme. Her role in the show is that of chief executive officer of the Holby City Hospital Primary Care Trust, making her the only regular character who is not a medic by profession. Vanessa was created by Holby City executive producer Tony McHale as a replacement for former CEO Jayne Grayson (Stella Gonet). Ash was cast in the role after a five-year break from acting, due to complications arising from MSSA. As Ash is disabled, Vanessa walks with the aid of a walking stick. Ash has praised Holby City producers for their willingness to cast a disabled actress, though faced some media criticism for accepting the role, as she had previously received ¬£5 million compensation for loss of earnings from the hospital at which she contracted MSSA. Vanessa is a \\"scheming\\", \\"conniving and calculated\\" executive, whose storylines have seen her clash with several members of the hospital's senior staff. Creation Vanessa was created in 2009 by Holby City executive producer Tony McHale, as a replacement for former CEO Jayne Grayson (Stella Gonet), who departed from the show during its eleventh series. It was first announced on 18 May 2009 that actress Leslie Ash had been cast in the role, after a five-year break from acting due to complications arising from MSSA. Ash commented that the role was the first she had had to audition for since the age of nineteen, and although nervous: \\"I am so pleased and happy they've given me this chance. They are very brave to have taken on a disabled actress. I can't wait to be back on set. It's the last piece of the jigsaw in my recovery. I'm finally back to where I was.\\" McHale commented: \\"We're thrilled to have Leslie join us at Holby. We know she's going to be a terrific asset to the show and her character will bring another dimension to our already strong cast. Her stories are going to have our viewers guessing all the way.\\" Her first scenes were filmed in June 2009, for broadcast in October 2009. Asked how long she saw herself staying in Holby City, Ash replied: \\"At the moment I‚Äôm really happy, so as long as they want me! I want it to go well so I can stay on. Also, I know there are lots of women out there who love this show and I don‚Äôt want them to be disappointed. I want them to say, 'She looks great!'\\". Ash was not a regular viewer of Holby City prior to her casting, but started that: \\"I'm actually quite surprised by the powerful women in the show and proud to be one. The scripts are brilliant and it‚Äôs very fast moving. It's a joy going to work every morning.\\" Ash sued Chelsea and Westminster NHS Trust for ¬£5 million in damages for loss of earnings after contracting MSSA, arguing that her resulting disability meant she would never win leading TV roles again. Considering her own experience, Ash felt that it was \\"ironic\\" to be playing a CEO, but commented that it made the role easier to play, as she had spent a lot of time on wards and dealing with hospital politics. She noted an initial reluctance to enter the hospital set, but found it helpful that she was already acquainted with co-stars Tina Hobley and Patsy Kensit Healy, as well as director Christopher King, who she worked with on ITV drama Where The Heart Is. Development Vanessa is described by the BBC as \\"scheming\\", \\"conniving and calculated\\". Ash called the role a \\"meaty, hard part\\", explaining of her character: \\"She's not had to work her way to the top and people resent her for it. She's used her toughness all the way.\\" As part of the character's costume, she wears black, thick-rimmed glasses. Due to Ash's disability, Vanessa uses a walking stick. Ash commented: \\"Disability is misrepresented on television and it's really fantastic that it did not worry the production team I was disabled.\\" Of Vanessa's backstory, Ash explained: \\"She rose through the ranks from a nurse to become a CEO rather easily and we can only imagine that she‚Äôs done it by stepping over people along the way. But with a smile on her face.\\" With regards to Vanessa's nursing background and the difference it made to her position, Ash explained: \\"They‚Äôre all so used to CEOs being very bureaucratic. I think it‚Äôs quite a shock to find someone who knows the medical side of things. They can‚Äôt get away with things, because she understands what‚Äôs going on.\\" Vanessa was introduced as an old friend of established character Michael Spence (Hari Dhillon), who helped her win the CEO position at Holby City Hospital in return for her helping him to deal with his rival Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing). Ash commented: \\"Together I think her and Michael are going to whip the hospital up into a frenzy.\\" She denied that Vanessa and Michael would be romantically involved, instead characterising their relationship as a case of \\"If you scratch my back, I‚Äôll scratch yours\\", explaining: \\"[Michael] gets his own way rather more easily with Vanessa around, and in return he helps her.\\" With regards to Vanessa's personal life, Ash divulged that she lives with a man who is unemployed, making Vanessa the main source of income in their relationship. Storylines Vanessa arrives in Holby as the new Chief Executive Officer of Holby City Hospital, replacing former CEO Jayne Grayson (Stella Gonet). She is recruited by Director of Surgery Michael Spence (Hari Dhillon), having previously worked with him when she was a nurse. Vanessa's first act as CEO is to approve funding for a robotics scheme run by cardiothoracic consultant Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing). Soon thereafter, she suspends Connie, general surgical consultant Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie) and ward sister Faye Byrne (Patsy Kensit Healy) over the death of Archie Morton (Conor Cremin), Faye's disabled son, unaware that the true culprit in his death is nurse Lauren Minster (Riann Steele). Vanessa goes on to appoint former surgical registrar Thandie Abebe-Griffin (Ginny Holder) as a locum on the cardiothoracic ward, causing tension with consultant Elliot Hope (Paul Bradley), who Thandie once accused of racial discrimination. Vanessa Left on 30 March. She left after making a show of Michael in the Board Room. Michael decides that she should leave after Mark says that he has written his resignation and that Maria should be given compensation for her back injury. Reception Ash's first episode as Vanessa was watched by 5.73 million viewers. It was selected as recommended viewing by the Daily Post and Daily Mirror, with The Mirror Jane Simon commenting: \\"Ash looks terrific despite being lumbered with big owlish glasses just like the ones that Manda (Josie Lawrence) has to wear in EastEnders.

They are capable of all types of climbing including bouldering, which consists of no ropes and usually a crash pad. Top roping, which uses a pre set anchor at the summit of your climb as well as a belayer who helps manage your climbing rope and your security during your climb. Also lead climbing, which is when the rope is attached to the climber, which the climber then clips onto either pre placed bolt anchors or other temporary anchor devices during the ascent, while the belayer manages the rope as well as the safety of the climber.  Alternative command methods  Climbers rely a lot on vocal commands. Vocal commands are used to assist in climbs in terms of navigation, safety, as well as it being the main source of communication between climbers. The only difference for deaf climbers that separates them from hearing climbers is that they cannot use vocal commands. Alternative command methods such as tugging of rope, either softly or gently, identifies with a certain command. The number of times as well as strength of the tug is how the command will be identified. This may take a lot of practice and vary within groups or individual deaf climbers so it is important to be clear of what amount of tugs as well as what the strength of each tug stands for what command. Sign Language may be used as a command method. This is the language of Deaf individuals who are in the deaf community. There are many people who are deaf who do not use sign language. This language is a visual language and does not require any vocal usage. Sign language uses facial and body gestures as well to distinguish meanings. Sign Language is not a universal language; it does vary within certain parts of the world, therefore for deaf climbers climbing outside of their region amongst other deaf climbers, this command method may be an obstacle when climbing. Hearing aids work on individuals who have some type of hearing loss but not on individuals who are completely deaf. They could be worn on one ear or both, mainly depending on the amount of hearing loss as well as which ear the hearing loss occurs from. A hearing aid amplifies sounds around an individual which can help make vocal commands during climbing much clearer for an individual with hearing loss. Another alternative command method that is very common especially in the Deaf community is the assistance of Sign Language interpreters. Sign language interpreters can help deaf climbers with communicating to those who are not deaf and assist deaf climbers when vocal commands are given from the belayer.  Deaf climber population  There are not any demographics for the population of deaf climbers.  Accomplished deaf climbers  Two deaf climbers, Alec Naiman from New York, and Paul Stefurak from Washington, reached the summit of Mount Rainier at 14,410 feet in July 1981. The summit attempt was completed alongside five blind climbers, a man with an artificial leg, and a person with epilepsy. Only two individuals in the group did not reach the summit. Heidi Zimmer was the first deaf woman to reach the summit of Mount McKinley in Alaska. She is the first deaf individual to reach the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa, as well as Mount Elbrus in the Republic of Russia which has an elevation of 18,510 feet. She has a goal of completing the seven summits which consist of the highest peak in each continent. This is considered a huge accomplishment in the climbing world. Yasayuki Okobu, a Japanese climber became the first deaf climber to summit Mount Vinson in Antarctica. He is not only the first deaf individual to summit Mount Vinson but also the first to attempt it. He completed this climb on January 2009 along with Rob Jarvis and numerous guides from Adventure Network International.  Organizations involved with deaf climbers  Many organizations across the world are involved with deaf individuals and climbing, because being a deaf climber causes a need for alternative methods to climbing, these organizations usually use one or more of these methods. The Aspen Camp for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing is a camp dedicated to deaf and hard of hearing kids and the outdoors. This organization focuses on climbing and uses this sport to encourage the kids and help them gain skills. The instructor named Clint Woosley who is the coordinator of the camp program as well is deaf along with some campers. Some of them are hearing and know sign language either through studies or a deaf family member, and some have hearing loss but can still hear and talk. Community services for the deaf hosts a climb a thon which provides services for individuals who are deaf in the Cincinnati area. This organization is a non- profit organization and provides various services for the deaf. They provide classes as well as outings to places such as climbing gyms and other outdoors events. Climb France is an organization run by climbers in the area of France and Sardinia. The services Climb France provides include climbing courses and guided tours throughout the mountains of France. In January 2009, Climb France teamed up with interpreters who were climbers themselves and guided a group of deaf climbers. Splore is a non-profit organization who provides services for individuals who are disabled. This organization works with various other organizations that are involved with the outdoors. Splore provides custom trips as well as classes for the disabled in numerous activities such as whitewater rafting, skiing and snowboarding, golf and climbing. Outward Bound is a non-profit organization which has schools around the world that provides programs indoors as well as out, the programs they provide all have to do with personal growth and skills, mental and physical growth, overall personal development. Outward Bound deals with numerous kinds of groups across the world despite disability, economic status, or other special needs. Outward Bound takes their groups to the wilderness, which is sometimes a day or overnight trip, and provide them with challenges that they are to face alone or through teamwork. They cater to students as well as teachers. Adventure Network International is based in the United States and is a guide group that handles expeditions in Antarctica. They guide trips such as safaris, private flights, and climbing. Adventure Network International is the only company in the world which guides explorers through expeditions in the Antarctic.

Commercially available RIDTs can provide results within 30 minutes. These results can be observed by a color change or other visual signals. For clinicians, RIDTs serve as a first-line test that can be confirmed (especially if negative) by traditional diagnostic tests. RIDTs also allow clinicians to promptly start antiviral treatment in high-risk populations, to formulate effective infection control measures, and to make informed decisions regarding diagnostic investigations. RIDTs have been shown to reduce chest radiography and blood tests in ambulatory care settings, but not antibiotic prescribing, or time in the emergency department. A study concludes that one test generated a false negative 49 percent of the time, meaning it detected H1N1 only 51 percent of the time. Another study found another test generated a false negative 82.2 percent of the time, detecting H1N1 only 17.2 percent of the time.

The use of the plantation, with more than 1,000 acres, was given to Davis by his much older brother, Joseph E. Davis (1784-1870); it had previously been a part of Joseph Davis's much larger Hurricane plantation which it adjoined on a bend of the Mississippi River twenty miles from Vicksburg. With his brother's financial assistance and the forced labor of enslaved people, Jefferson Davis became a successful planter on the acreage following his brief first marriage to Sarah Knox Taylor (who died of malaria a few months after their wedding); after his second marriage to Varina Banks Howell in 1845, Davis erected a large comfortable frame house on the property that was home to himself, his wife, their children, as well as Davis's widowed sister and other relatives. Brierfield had very profitable years as well as years of disastrous flooding, but generally provided a comfortable living to subsidize Davis's modest earnings from public office. Davis left the plantation for long periods of time, including his term in the House of Representatives, his service in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, his terms in the Senate, and his four years as Secretary of War in the Franklin Pierce Administration. He regarded Brierfield as his primary residence and returned to it when not in office, and after his resignation from the United States Senate following the Secession of Mississippi in 1861. His return to Brierfield was brief, as he was soon notified, while tending the flower gardens of the house with his wife (as he recalled), that he had been elected president of the newly formed Confederate States of America and was summoned to Montgomery, Alabama, the Confederacy's first capital. Davis did not visit Brierfield during his tenure as Confederate president. In early 1862 a small group of enslaved people liberated themselves, reclaimed some property that had been bought with their stolen labour and fled to the Union lines near Vicksburg. In the summer of 1863, the Davis plantation came directly under attack from Unionist forces and at least 137 of the more than 200 enslaved people who lived on the plantation made a break for freedom by crossing to the Union side. The rest soon followed.http://www.historynet.com/cease-fire- jefferson-davis-lost-slaves.htm Old Court House Museum, Vicksburg, Mississippi Unlike the far larger and finer mansion of Joseph Davis at the adjoining Hurricane Plantation, which was burned to the ground, the house at Brierfield was spared the torch and used as, consecutively, field headquarters, a hospital, and a supply house for Union troops during the Mississippi campaigns. A photograph of the occupied house bearing the banner \\"The House Jeff Built\\" was widely circulated in newspapers. Joseph Davis, who had never given Jefferson Davis title to the property, negotiated its sale after the war on a mortgage to members of the Montgomery family, former Davis family slaves, bequeathing the income from the mortgage, but not the real estate, to Jefferson in his will. The Montgomery family defaulted on the mortgage after Joseph Davis's death and the property reverted to his estate. The heirs to Joseph Davis's Hurricane plantation (his grandchildren by an acknowledged illegitimate daughter) claimed ownership of the reverted Brierfield as well, a claim disputed by Jefferson Davis, resulting in a lengthy lawsuit that was ultimately decided in Jefferson Davis's favor in 1881, giving him undisputed title to the Brierfield property for the first time, more than forty years after he first settled on the plantation.See Davis v. Bowmar, 55 Miss. 671, adhered to on reargument, 55 Miss. 751 (1878). Though his primary residence in the final decade of his life was at Beauvoir, the house and farm he had inherited near Biloxi, Jefferson Davis spent much of the remaining years of his life attempting to make Brierfield profitable again, but a combination of fluctuating cotton prices, floods, and the cost of free (no longer enslaved) labor now denied him the income the property had once provided. He was in residence at Brierfield in autumn of 1889 seeing to harvest when a lingering cold developed into pneumonia and he had to be carried onto a riverboat bound for New Orleans to receive medical attention; he died a few weeks later. After Davis's death, his widow and surviving children left Mississippi and none of his descendants ever resided at Brierfield. The house was destroyed by fire in 1931. A drainage canal converted what had been a peninsula jutting into the Mississippi River into an island. Some of the family's belongings that were taken from the house by troops were returned to the Davis family over the following decades and may now be found at various museums associated with the Davis family and the Civil War.

It lies on the Llangollen Canal, immediately northwards of the Chirk Aqueduct. It is long and has a complete towpath inside. The tunnel is designed for a single standard narrowboat, so passing is not possible. The tunnel is straight enough to be able to see if a boat is already inside the tunnel, and boats are required to show a light. Northbound boats must maintain power and momentum in order to push through, due to the shallow, narrow nature of the canal in the tunnel (such that water has little space to pass around the displacement of the boat), and the relatively fast southbound current of the canal. The tunnel, the tunnel portals and the canal basin are collectively a Grade II* listed structure. History Southern portal of the tunnel In 1791, the embryonic Ellesmere Canal was planning a network of canals to link the Chester Canal to Shrewsbury, with branches to Ruabon and Llangollen, Bersham, Llanymynech and possibly to Whitchurch and Wem. The promoters asked William Jessop to assess their plans, and he produced plans for a rather different route, running from the Chester Canal basin through Wrexham, Bersham, Ruabon, Pontcysyllte, Chirk, Frankton and Weston to reach Shrewsbury. The route would have involved three tunnels, one of at Ruabon, one of at Weston, and a tunnel under the Froncysyllte limeworks at Chirk, which would have been long. Rival parties supporting the different routes joined forces in February 1793, and the canal was authorised by Act of Parliament on 30 April of that year. A whole series of alterations and deviations had been rushed through in the intervening months, and the canal at Chirk now crossed the River Ceiriog at a different location, resulting in a shorter tunnel. The contract for the adjacent aqueduct was let in January 1796, and its construction was completed in 1801. The of canal eastwards to Frankton was opened immediately, because of the valuable trade in limestone from the Fron Quarries. The section through the tunnel, which also passed through Whitehouse Tunnel to reach Pontcysyllte was opened in June 1802. Walking through the tunnel The tunnel is claimed to be the first in Britain to have a towpath running through it (along with its shorter neighbour, Whitehouse Tunnel). However, Berwick Tunnel on the Shrewsbury Canal was open by 1797 and included a towpath throughout its length. As the tunnel at Chirk is completely unlit, it is preferable to use a torch/flashlight when walking through the tunnel, as towards the centre it is pitch black. There is however a wooden handrail along the entire length to prevent walkers falling in the canal.

Located on a peninsula of the Mississippi River in Warren County, Mississippi, called Davis Bend after its owner, Hurricane Plantation at its peak in the antebellum era comprised more than with approximately of river frontage worked by hundreds of slaves. Joseph Davis owned 346 slaves and had a personal worth of more than $600,000 in the 1860 U.S. Census, making him one of the wealthiest men in the state of Mississippi. The mansion at Hurricane was a three-story main house with two large semi-detached wings for entertaining, and a detached library. It contained indoor plumbing and an early form of air conditioning. There were also numerous outbuildings typical of a plantation of that scale. The residence was described in detail by Varina Davis (Jefferson Davis's second wife), in a memoir of her husband. Joseph Davis had served as surrogate father and de facto guardian for his brother Jefferson Davis, who was 23 years younger. In the 1830s, Joseph Davis gave Jefferson the full use of more than adjoining Hurricane. Jefferson Davis developed a plantation here, naming it Brierfield. Specific details of the arrangement are uncertain, as Joseph Davis retained ownership of the land. Jefferson Davis, and later his second wife and children with him, occupied Brierfield until the beginning of the Civil War in 1861. After the fall of New Orleans to Federal troops and the increasing military presence near Vicksburg, Davis relocated from Hurricane Plantation with members of his family and some of his slaves to Tuscaloosa, Alabama. The main house of Hurricane Plantation was burned by Federal troops in 1862, and the plantation looted numerous times by both armies during the campaign of Vicksburg. Only the library, a building independent of the main house, survived the war. After the war Joseph Davis sold the property to Ben Montgomery, a former slave whom he had promoted before the war as manager of his plantation, and a group of freedmen. They financed the sale by a long-term note. Davis died in 1870. He was buried in the Davis Family cemetery on Davis Island, but his gravestone has been damaged. He had several legally acknowledged illegitimate daughters, but no legitimate children. His heirs foreclosed on the note with Montgomery & Sons, after they were unable to make payments due to declining cotton prices and losses because of years of floods (1867, 1868, 1871, and 1874) that damaged the property. Montgomery died in 1877. Confusion as to the titles of the Hurricane and Brierfield properties led to lawsuits for control between Jefferson Davis and his brother's heirs. Jefferson ultimately gained title to the Brierfield property in 1878 but never lived there again. Joseph Davis's grandchildren (from one of his legally acknowledged illegitimate daughters) received Hurricane. A canal had been cut across the peninsula for flood control. It was claimed by the Mississippi River in 1867 as the main channel when a major flood changed its route. The former peninsula was renamed as Davis Island.Brian Hamilton, \\"Davis Island: A Confederate Shrine, Submerged\\", Edge Effects, 9 October 2014, University of Wisconsin-Madison The main buildings of Brierfield Plantation burned down in 1931. Despite increasing damage from floods, the Davis family retained the properties until 1953. It was sold and quickly flipped to a lawyer from Vidalia, Louisiana, who reserved it for hunting. He and his family established the Brierfield Hunting Club, so private that it has people come by invitation only.

Leonardi began as an episcopal vicar, however, due to his education and abilities, he became a delegate of the Congregation of Religious Propaganda under the Roman Curia. He received orders in 1636 to spread Catholicism throughout Dalmatia and the Bay of Cattaro. He was especially devoted to the conversion of the local Pa≈°troviƒá clan to Catholicism. In his report to the Congregation, he stated that the crossover of Montenegro to Catholicism is especially important in the spread of Catholicism in Serbia and the Balkans in general. In 1638, Leonardi met with Mardarius, the Orthodox Metropolitan of Cetinje, to discuss his potential conversion to Catholicism. The duo met once more in 1639 in Cetinje, discussing Mardarius' conversion to Catholicism and him visiting Rome. Mardarius expressed his readiness in accepting the offer, also demanding that the Roman Curia allot the same wages as the bishops under the Ottoman Empire. However, because of his closeness with the Curia, the Ottoman Turks imprisoned Mardarius. Upon his release from prison in early 1640, he met with Leonardi in Maine and converted to Catholicism, acknowledging submission to the Pope.

Walker was a late bloomer as an archaeologist, launching this 22-year career when he was in his sixties, after long stints in garment retail and real estate. Early life Edwin, known as Ned, was the son of Francis Horton Walker and Marilla Antoinette Metcalf, he a real estate and publishing man, she a nurse, and both from old New England families. Marilla‚Äôs father, Mason Jerome Metcalf, was a Boston inventor of some note. The couple moved to Evanston, Ill. in 1870. Edwin was born two years later in Chicago. In 1890, Edwin Francis Walker graduated from high school in Evanston. Five years later, by his own account, he set out from Albuquerque, N.M., to mine gold in the territories with three other men. Later, his childhood friend, Royce Armstrong, staked him and joined him in a 2,000-mile trek around the Southwest during which they mined for gold, explored ancient ruins, and had other adventures. For this trip, Walker may have drawn inspiration from Charles F. Lummis, who himself embarked on a walk or \\"tramp\\" from Cincinnati to Los Angeles in 1884-85, to assume an editor's post at the Los Angeles Times. Walker‚Äôs own adventure produced no gold, but it did result in a later manuscript, 1600 Mile Trip by Burro - Albuquerque to Los Angeles, 1895‚Äì1896, written in 1938 but not published until 1985, by the Tucson Corral of the Westerners. Edwin dedicated the tome to his two sons, Edwin Francis Jr. and Winslow Metcalf, whom he addresses in a long dedication that begins: \\"Here are the Western stories you listened to so respectfully, and so often, from the time you were able to sit up and take notice.\\" Retail career About 1900, Walker began his first job, as a clerk at the Chase & Sanborn Coffee Co. in Chicago. That same year, he married Harriet Howe Fitch. Their two sons followed shortly: Winslow was born in 1903, and Edwin Jr. in 1908. By 1910, Walker had moved from coffee to clothing as a manager for Chicago-based Marshall Field & Company. Later, he became a manager for Sears, Roebuck and Co. In the early 1920s, he accepted an offer from Los Angeles-based Bullock's and moved the family out West. Real estate and pottery business In 1926, Walker left retail for real estate, managing sales of lots for Frank Putnam Flint, the former federal prosecutor and U.S. Senator, at the new subdivision named after him, Flintridge. At the same time, Walker was involved in another business venture, a pottery factory called International Clay Products, Inc., of Alhambra, which manufactured pottery and tiles using traditional methods. But the factory went bankrupt during the 1929 stock market crash that launched the Great Depression. The real estate business also had dried up, and Walker, 57, was getting close to what today is considered retirement age. Archeology In 1934, Walker began his most important work, as a research assistant at the Southwest Museum, which Lummis had founded. It isn‚Äôt known if the two men ever met before Lummis died in 1928. The director of the museum at the time was Walker‚Äôs sometime neighbor, Frederick Webb Hodge. For 22 years, Walker was a main investigator for the museum. He was a pioneer in the specialty known as salvage archaeology, which studied archaeological sites uncovered by construction crews working on commercial or residential developments. The discipline required a sharp eye and an ability to work quickly to allow the construction projects eventually to proceed. Walker published several works on his finds. His most notable was a 1952 monograph entitled Five Prehistoric Archeological Sites in Los Angeles County, California. It describes five important southern California archaeological sites excavated from 1936 to 1945. Though they helped improve scholars' understanding of California Native American groups, none of the sites exist today except in the literature, as the construction projects paved or built over them. Walker's monograph was reviewed by Malcolm Farmer in the October 1952 edition of the journal American Antiquity. Walker died at his Flintridge home on December 3, 1956, just months after retiring from his job at the museum.

She was scuttled during the fall of Singapore in 1942. Construction She was laid down at the Scotstoun yard of Charles Connell and Company in February 1915, launched on 10 June 1915 and completed in August 1915. The Acacia-class fleet sweeping sloops were adapted for escort work, minesweeping and as decoy warships. Service history First World War Laburnum joined the First Sloop Flotilla on commissioning. On 4 September 1915, the passenger liner was torpedoed without warning by the German submarine southwest of Queenstown (now called Cobh) in the south of Ireland with the loss of 32 lives. Laburnum was one of several ships, also including the seaplane carrier and the sloops and , to go to Hesperians aid. Attempts to tow Hesperian to port failed, with the stricken liner sinking on 6 September. The sinking of the Hesperian, which occurred despite an assurance to US President Woodrow Wilson from the German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann- Hollweg that no passenger liners would be sank without warning, provoked protests from America that resulted in the submarine campaign against merchant shipping in British waters being suspended for several months. On 24 April 1916, the Easter Rising, an armed rebellion by Irish republicans against British rule, began. Laburnum was ordered to Galway to defend the port on 25 April, arriving there on 26 April. On hearing reports that a group of rebels were advancing on the port, the Captain of Laburnum ordered her to open fire, with 10 shells being fired in the direction of the rebels and at a road on the outskirts of the city. On 28 April, Laburnum escorted a transport carrying troops to Galway. On 8 February 1917, the passenger steamer was torpedoed by the German submarine WSW of Fastnet Rock, causing Mantolas crew to abandon ship. U-81 remained in the vicinity until chased away by Laburnum when she arrived on the scene hours later. Laburnum rescued 176 survivors of Mantolas passengers and crew (seven crewmen had been killed by a capsizing lifeboat) but attempts to talk the steamer in tow failed, and Mantola sank on 9 February. On 17 February 1917, the Q-ship was torpedoed by the German submarine , but after a \\"panic party\\" faked abandoning ship, U-83 surfaced near Farnborough and was sunk by shellfire from the Q-ship. Farnborough herself was badly damaged by the torpedo, and was taken into tow by Laburnum and the sloop after the destroyer had taken off most of Farnboroughs crew. Farnborough was beached at Mill Cove. On 25 February 1917 Laburnum was patrolling to the west of the Blasket Islands, off the west coast of Ireland, when she was ordered to meet up with and escort the liner which was Liverpool- bound from the United States. Uncertainty about Laconias location delayed the rendezvous between the ships, with the result that Laconia was torpedoed by the German submarine before Laburnum could arrive on the scene. While Laburnum could not prevent Laconia sinking, she did manage to rescue 292 passengers and crew. Twelve passengers and crew were killed. Far East service She was in the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy from 11 March 1922 to 11 February 1935, where she exercised with cruisers, toured New Zealand ports, took part in ceremonial occasions, and went on annual Pacific Island cruises. This was in conjunction with her sister ship which was similar, but with small differences as they came from different commercial shipyards. She left Auckland on 1 February 1935 for Singapore, where she was paid off to become a drill and training ship for the Straits Settlement Naval Volunteer Reserve. Drill ship at Singapore As drill ship, Laburnum was equipped with independent wireless equipment, and housed a number of naval offices including Captain, Auxiliary Vessels and Captain, Extended Defences Office. Laburnum had her engines removed shortly after her arrival in Singapore in order to augment her accommodation. Hence she could not be fully utilised when war broke out in the Far East. With the evacuation of Penang, Laburnum also played host to the RNVR Penang Division, headed by Commander C C Alexander. Fate Labernum was scuttled on 15 February 1942 when Singapore fell to Japanese forces. Her wreck was raised about 1946, and sunk off East Lagoon, Singapore, as part of an existing breakwater of old hulks, and finally removed and scrapped about 1967.

He belonged to the Dominican Order. Originally from Zara (Zadar), Republic of Venice (present-day Croatia), Bonaldo served a theological professor in the Basilica of Santa Maria above Minerva in Rome. Pope Innocent X appointed Bonaldo as the Archbishop of Antivari in 1646 with an annual income of 200 Roman scudi. With the bishops from Ottoman-controlled lands, Bonaldo forged plans for freedom, presenting them to the Venetian admiral, Leonardo Foscolo. When Foscolo captured Klis in 1648, in his company was Bonaldo. The following year, Foscolo turned to southern Montenegro, unloading his guns near Antivari. However, the Ottoman army was awaiting his arrival to which Foscolo retreated. By then, a pogrom among Antivari's Catholic population occurred, in which a large number of Catholics converted to Islam. Bonaldo lived in the region of Pa≈°troviƒái, where he converted many Muslims to Catholicism. Bonaldo died from tuberculosis in 1653. He was buried in a cathedral in Budva.

It was assigned to the 21st Space Wing, stationed at Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado. It was responsible for ground-based missile warning, space control operations. It provided real-time missile warning, attack assessment, and space control. The 21 OG was also responsible for the development of future counterspace capabilities and was the most geographically dispersed operations group in the Space Force.https://www.peterson.af.mil/Units/21stOG/ World War II Emblem of the World War II 21st Bombardment Group (Medium) Emblem of the World War II 21st Fighter Group 21st Fighter Group at Iwo Jima (Mount Suribachi in the background) Flight Line, Iwo Jima, Field No. 2, Spring 1945 : For additional history and lineage see 21st Space Wing Constituted as 21st Bombardment Group (Medium) on 13 January 1942. Activated on 1 February 1942 at Bowman Field, Kentucky. Thereafter, from February 1942 until October 1943, the group relocated successively to Jackson Army Air Base; Mississippi; Columbia Army Air Base, South Carolina; Key Field, Mississippi, and MacDill Field, Florida. The 21st initially trained on B-25 Mitchell bombers then converted to B-26 Marauders. The group largely served as an operational training unit assigned to Third Air Force; however, while at MacDill Field, from June 1942 to October 1943, the 21st additionally carried out antisubmarine patrols over the Caribbean Sea. For this action the group received the Antisubmarine 1941‚Äì1945 campaign streamer. The 21st inactivated on 10 October 1943. The 21st did not have to wait long to write a further chapter in the history of warfare. Another unit, the 21st Fighter Group (FG), activated on 21 April 1944 at Wheeler Army Airfield in the Hawaii Territory. Assigned to VII Fighter Command, the group consisted of the 46th, 72d, and 531st Fighter Squadrons. Over the next two months, the group trained on its first aircraft type, the P-39Q Airacobra. The 21st provided air defense over the Hawaiian Islands from July 1944, then began upgrading into the P-38J/L Lightning in September. By the end of October, rumors filled the air that the group soon would upgrade airframes again, this time to the P-51 Mustang. This change in aircraft heralded a new mission for the 21 FG. True to rumor, leading echelons began deploying by ship to the island of Iwo Jima in the western Pacific in February 1945. Before the end of the month, the 21st began flying patrols over the critical island base in support of ground operations. The final group echelon arrived at Iwo Jima on 25 March. Early the next morning, elements of the 21st were attacked in their encampment by Japanese soldiers. Assisted by a patrol of American Marines, 21st personnel counterattacked and in the tent-by-tent fighting killed 250 of the enemy. Fourteen group personnel were killed and 50, including 21 FG commander Colonel Kenneth R. Powell, were wounded. The first long-range aerial mission of the 21st Fighter Group against the mainland of Japan began on 7 April 1945, when the group's Mustangs escorted a formation of B-29 bombers against the fortified and well-defended Nakajima aircraft factory near Tokyo. This mission marked the first time fighters had escorted bombers over Japan. Moreover, this mission has been credited as having been the longest over-water fighter escort sortie to date. Over the following weeks, the 21st escorted American B-29s over enemy airfields and industrial targets and engaged rival Japanese fighter aircraft. The 531st Squadron achieved another first for the 21 FG in June 1945 by initiating aerial rocket strike sorties against select enemy targets which included ships and a radio station. In the meantime, the groups' aircraft continued to duel in the air and two \\"aces\\" soon emerged: Major Harry Crim and Captain Willis Matthews, both of the 531st Fighter Squadron. Aircrews of the 21st also strafed the airfields which the Japanese used for their increasingly dangerous kamikaze attacks. The 21 FG flew its last combat mission 14 August 1945, about two weeks before the official Japanese capitulation on 2 September. The group received the Distinguished Unit Citation on 13 November 1945 specifically for its outstanding conduct during the earlier raid on Nakajima. However, the 21st had played a laudable part throughout the final stages of the war in the Pacific. After the war, the group transferred from Iwo Jima, first to Saipan, then finally to Guam. Re-equipped with P-47 Thunderbolts during the summer of 1946. The 21 FG inactivated on 10 October 1946.

Activated at George AFB California on 1 January 1953 with three (72d, 416th and 531st) Fighter-Bomber squadrons. Assigned to Tactical Air Command. Equipped for a few months with F-51's, later with F-86's. Maintained tactical proficiency and provided air defense augmentation in the United States, January 1953 ‚Äì November 1954. At George, the group established and maintained tactical proficiency and provided air defense augmentation. In December 1954, the group was assigned to NATO and was reassigned to Chambley-Bussieres Air Base, France. The 21 FBG consisted of three squadrons, the 72d, 416th and 531st Fighter-Bomber Squadrons, equipped with the F-86F Sabre. Upon their arrival, the facilities at Chambley were not ready for aircraft use, and the squadrons had to deploy elsewhere. The 72d deployed to Chateauroux AB, while the 416th and 531st operated out of Toul-Rosieres AB. After many construction delays, the group combined its fighter squadrons at Chambley on 15 April 1955. The squadrons carried out close air support training missions with the Army, then took first place at the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) \\"Gunnery Meet\\" at Wheelus Air Base, Libya. The 21 FBW participated in the Atomic Warfare exercise Carte Blanche, and went on to take an overall second place in the Nellis AFB, Nevada Gunnery Meet in 1956. Moreover, they won the USAFE Award for Tactical Proficiency for the January‚ÄìJune period of 1957. In 1957, the French Government decreed that all nuclear weapons and delivery aircraft had to be removed from French soil by July 1958. As a result, the F-86's of the 21st Fighter-Bomber Group had to be removed from France. During October 1957 it was announced that the 21 FBG would be inactivated on 8 February 1958, and that its assets would be dispersed among existing USAFE units.  After 1991  In 1991, the 21st Tactical Fighter Wing was reorganized as an objective wing and all the major tenant units on Elmendorf AFB, Alaska were placed under it. The 21st Operations Group was the flying component of the 21st Wing. The 21st Wing was inactivated and the 3d Wing was reassigned from Clark Air Base, Philippines to Elmendorf on 19 December 1991 as a result of the Mount Pinatubo eruption and the inhabitability of Clark. This was in keeping Air Force's policies of retaining the oldest and most illustrious units. The 21st Operations Group was reactivated on 15 May 1992 as a component of the redesignated and reactivated 21st Space Wing, commanding Air Force Space Command's worldwide network of assigned missile warning, space surveillance, and communications units.

The treaty established a commercial alliance between these two nations and was signed during the American Revolutionary War.  Background  In 1783 Benjamin Franklin was the American resident in Paris, and on September 28, 1782 he was given a new assignment by Congress, and was made Minister Plenipotentiary to His Majesty King Gustav III of Sweden. However, because Franklin was based in Paris, France, the discussions were carried out via the Swedish ambassador to the court of France, Count Gustaf Philip Creutz. On April 3, 1783, the two of them signed the treaty. Later that same year (1783), the Treaty of Paris was signed in Paris by representatives of King George III of Great Britain and representatives of the United States of America on September 3, 1783, which ended the American Revolutionary War.

Until his departure in 1995, he was the group's front man. He plays guitar, banjo, mandolin and tin whistle.  Early life and career  Born in Ballymena, County Antrim, Northern Ireland. Millar and his sister Sandra Beech performed as The Millar Kids before the family emigrated to Canada in 1953 when Millar was 14. Millar formed a Calypso Band, Kalypso Kews, that performed for two years in Toronto's Yonge Street at the Calypso Club. Millar moved to Calgary, Alberta and hosted a children's television show as well as forming an Irish folk trio. In the 1960s, Millar invited his brother, then 15, George, his cousin Joe and Jimmy Ferguson to stay with him in Calgary. He brought them on his television show and started performing with them at Calgary's first folk club, The Depression.  Irish Rovers  Under the guidance of Les Weinstein, Millar's manager, he took the new group to San Francisco and after an audition they made the Purple Onion in San Francisco and the Ice House in Pasadena their home base club. In 1968, under the production of Bud Dant of Decca Records, the group's recording of the Shel Silverstein song \\"The Unicorn\\" went to #1 in Canada and #3 on the Billboard pop chart in the U.S. and became the Irish Rovers' signature song. Between 1970 and 1973, Millar travelled back and forth between Ireland and Canada to manage an Irish Georgian manor and to host a TV show. Their CBC-TV show included guests such as Johnny Cash, The Carter Family, Waylon Jennings, Pat Boone and Roger Miller. In 1980, he and his wife Catherine lived in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island before moving to Vancouver, British Columbia in 1982. In 1995, Millar, after 30 years of leading the Irish Rovers grew restless to pursue other creative interests. He formed a new band called Some Mad Irishmen and released two CDs and toured extensively with his creation of the stage production of \\"Ireland..where the song and dance began\\". He built a recording studio with his friend John Ellis and recorded a children's CD on the Attic label. He also appeared semi-regularly on The Red Green Show as Jimmy McVeigh, a postman who was trying to repair a boat. At this time he devoted a good part of his time to develop his first love of Art. Since his departure from the Irish Rovers, Millar has produced six solo albums. Four Celtic instrumental CDs were released by Chacra Music, The Lark in the Clear Aire, Celtic Seasons, Celtic Reverie and Journey of the Celt. Two of these albums went Gold in Canada. Millar has published two books, Children of the Unicorn (published by McClelland and Stewart) and Messing About in Boats (published by Whitecap Publishers). The latter made it to the top ten in The Globe and Mail's non-fiction list. Today Millar's Art hangs in many Galleries across Canada and also back in Ireland. His annual Gallery Shows have become very popular. In 2013, Millar and his wife Catherine lived next to Quamichan Lake in the municipality of North Cowichan on Vancouver Island.

The L3 larvae migrate to the mesenteric lymph nodes and moult to L4, and L5. The L5 larvae migrate through the portal circulation and through the liver and the adults end up at the pulmonary artery or right side of the heart. The adults then mate and produce eggs. The eggs move to the alveolar capillaries via the circulation and hatch to L1 larvae. The L1 larvae burrow though the alveolar and are then coughed up and swallowed. L1 larvae are therefore passed in the faeces of infected cannids. The L1 larvae infect intermediate hosts (primarily slugs and snails) by penetrating the foot of the mollusc and develop to L3 within. Adult worms can live for 2 years. The pre-patent period is 6‚Äì10 weeks.  Pathology and diagnosis Pathology is from both the adult worms, eggs and larvae. Cardio-respiratory signs are one clinical symptom. Chronic, coughing, exercise intolerance, dyspnoea and tachypnoea in young dogs is due to blood vessels being blocked by adults, eggs and larvae. The parasite also causes coagulopathies. Haematomas and prolonged bleeding are as a result of thrombocytopaenia (a decrease in the number of platelets in the blood). Clotting factors V and VIII are also reduced. Hypochromic anaemia is another symptom, also used in diagnosis and is due to the parasite interfering with haemoglobin synthesis. Angiostrongylus vasorum also causes neurological damage. These present as ataxia, paresis, loss of vision, behavioural changes and seizures. All these symptoms are as a direct result of CNS haemorrhages. Diagnosis is made from a combination of clinical signs and tests. Imaging can show lung lesions in the peripheral lobes. Blood tests, showing eosinophillia, poor clotting ability and speed as well as hypochomric anemia all point towards a diagnosis. Some cases may also have hypercalcaemia the cause of this unknown but may relate to granulomatous inflammation and macrophage production of alpha 1 hydroxylase. Faecal examination using the Baerman technique are unreliable, as egg output is irregular and the pre-patent period of the parasite is relatively long. However this test is more sensitive than a faecal smear examination. Multiple samples help reduce the risk of a false negative but should not be relied upon. Post mortem examination can also reveal the causative agent to be Angiosrongylus vasorum. Again, lung lesions (looking for mottled lungs) are seen. Subcutaneous haematomas and enlarged blood vessels are common. Another sign is endocarditis of the right side of the heart and the tricuspid valve.  Hosts  The natural intermediate hosts of Angiostrongylus vasorum are land slugs, land snails and freshwater snails. Angiostrongylus vasorum shows little host specificity in its intermediate host. * Arion ater - natural host Natural definitive hosts are domestic dogs and various other carnivores include: * red fox Vulpes vulpes * pampas fox Pseudalopex gymnocerus * hoary fox Pseudalopex vetulus * crab-eating fox Dusicyon thous * wolf Canis lupus * coyote Canis latrans * African desert fox Fennecus zerda * European badger Meles meles. Angiostrongylus vasorum lives in the right ventricle of the heart and the pulmonary artery. The infection can be fatal in dogs. Natural paratenic hosts can be frogs, lizards, mice, rats. Experimental intermediate hosts of Angiostrongylus vasorum include: * Biomphalaria glabrata - (experimental) * Biomphalaria tenagophila - (experimental) Other known experimental hosts include: * slugs: Arion vulgaris (referred as Arion lusitanicus), Arion hortensis, Deroceras reticulatum, Limax flavus, Laevicaulis alte. * land snails: Achatina fulica, Arianta arbustorum, Bradybaena similaris, Cepaea nemoralis, Cochlodina laminata, Eceparypha physana, Helix pomatia, Cornu aspersum, Prosopeas javanicum, Subulina octona, Succinea putris. * freshwater snails: Biomphalaria pfeifferi, Physa sp. Experimental definitive hosts of Angiostrongylus vasorum include: * jackal Canis aureus * Arvicanthis niloticus, an African rat  Distribution  The native area (enzootic) of Angiostrongylus vasorum is Western Europe (United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Spain). Up to 23% of foxes are infected in southeast England. 5% of patent infected dogs are clinically healthy. There is a correlation between high fox incidence and domestic dog incidence, logically leading to the assumption that the fox is an important wildlife reservoir of this parasite. Other known areas include Europe: Denmark,Ferdushy T. Kapel C. M. O., Webster P., Al-Sabi M. N. S. & Gr√∏nvold J. (December 2009, online 22 May 2009) \\"The occurrence of Angiostrongylus vasorum in terrestrial slugs from forests and parks in the Copenhagen area, Denmark\\".

Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Portugal * Africa: Uganda * Asia: Turkey and countries of the former USSR * Northern America: Canada (Newfoundland), the United States Larvae of the first stage were found in Australia, Argentina and Greece. The area where this species is found is expanding. It has also been reported from South America: Brazil and Colombia, but molecular analysis revealed that Angiostrongylus vasorum from Brazil has a different genotype. Thus it is possible that it is a different species in Brazil and in elsewhere in South America.  Treatment and prevention  In Europe imidacloprid 10%/moxidectin 2.5% is approved for treatment and prevention of Angiostrongylus vasorum in dogs. For treatment of infected dogs, a single dose should be administered. A further veterinary examination 30 days after treatment is recommended as some animals may require a second treatment. In endemic areas, monthly application will prevent angiostrongylosis and patent infection with Angiostrongylus vasorum.[Noah Compendium 2015]  References   Further reading  * . * .

While the St. Stephen's community worshipped at the site beginning in 1837, the current church building was consecrated in 1855 and the rector presently serving the congregation is Fr. Robert Legnani. Founding and erection The congregation of St. Stephen's Episcopal Church formed in 1837 at the request of 44 families to Bishop Doane of the Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey for services of the church in the City of Beverly. The first church, a white frame building erected on Copper Street, had an adjacent cemetery that still exists today. When the City of Beverly was incorporated in 1857, St. Stephen's established would become Beverly's first church. By 1853, the congregation had outgrown the original wood church and land was purchased at the corner of Warren and Wilmerton Streets for a new structure. The new property allowed for the construction of a larger more elaborate church. The location also increased the prominence of the parish by its place on Warren Street, a main transportation corridor between Beverly, Burlington City and other industrial river towns. The church's steeple acted as a landmark beacon for shippers on the Delaware. On October 1, 1855, the present St. Stephen's Church was consecrated by the second bishop of the Diocese of New Jersey, the Right Reverend George W. Doane. Early Church history and architecture Built between 1853 and 1855, St. Stephen's represents a period in church architecture that sought to revive the spirit of the Gothic parish church, creating a worship space that was both spiritually reverential while at the same time expressing an architectural vocabulary of rational truth; in the building's ornament, materials and plan. This return to the English Gothic architectural form was promoted in the 1830s in England and was at its height in America when St. Stephen's was constructed. The Ecclesiology movement was a reaction to a period in church history when architectural form of new churches became increasingly variable. The Ecclesiology movement feared this informality and inconsistency distracted from the basic moral and theological mission of the church. The Basic principles underlying the Ecclesiological model church, which are exemplified in St. Stephen's, are a simple plan, basic materials and ornament that is complementary to the overall simplicity of the church. The plan of the Ecclesiological church is simple: the nave (the portion of the church containing the center aisle and pews) and the chancel (the portion of the church containing the altar and choir). Ideally, the materials of the church should be stone, but wood could be used with the hope that the means to afford stone would become available in the future. The ornament of St. Stephen's, both simple and elegant in its execution, illustrates the restrained propriety the Ecclesiologists used in creating the medieval sense of the place they felt most spiritually truthful in a place of worship. While much has changed outside the walls of St. Stephen's Church since its construction, the church interior that is similar to what visitors have been seeing for the better part of 130 years. The photographs show the view looking through the nave to the altar from just inside of the church interior doors. At the ceiling, a hybrid truss-arch system of roof support resembles the inside of a ship's hull. Though these structural timbers seem massive, they are actually secondary to the main rafters that are buried under the ceiling plaster. St. Stephen's stained glass windows The collection of stained glass windows of St. Stephen's Church displays a historically significant range of stained glass styles from the 1850s into the early 20th century. Generally, the age of the windows range from the oldest located in the chancel to the newest located in the vestibule. St. Stephen's has windows ranging from the textured muffle and reeded glass panels of mid-19th century American Gothic windows; to works by J.R. Lamb, a rival of the Tiffany Glass studios; and even comparatively modern windows dated from the 1970s and 80s by Cherry Hill artist F. Paul Skelly. Church preservation effort With the help of architectural firm Farewell Mills & Gatsch, the St. Stephen's community navigated through a seven-year-long New Jersey Historical Trust grants process obtaining awards for a preservation plan, engineering studies and finally construction. Wu & Associates, Inc, the selected preservation contractor from nearby Cherry Hill, New Jersey, focused on restoring the church's ‚Äúbeacon‚Äù feature, the steeple. Following a lightning strike in 1983 the structure burned down two-thirds of the way. While the immediate problem was solved with a lightning rod, the replacement cedar shakes continued to be damaged by area wildlife. Steeple Work at St. Stephen's In accordance with the New Jersey Historic Trust's wishes to preserve the origin of the church, the community and construction team researched the church's history. According to some old photos and a 1909 postcard, the steeple looks as dark as the roof and there is a good chance the original was slate as the newly constructed roof was decided upon. Steel girding anchored in the tower masonry walls rather than the 150-year-old wood beams now support the steeple. New flooring, fresh but historically accurate paint colors, a clean church bell, and a releaded and repaired stained glass window in the tower were all additional improvements in St. Stephen's preservation efforts. While the range of stained-glass window styles and woodwork within the building are the most elaborate of the church's designs, Wu & Associates work stabilizing the structure and preserving the simplicity of the building's design was important in saving the history of its architectural story and its place in Beverly's. The grants funding the project were supplemented by not only the contributions of members, highlighted by the over $4,000 raised by the parish children's ‚ÄúMile of Nickels‚Äù campaign, but also businesses and other people in the larger town community.

It has been heavily criticized by independent and governmental research groups for its lack of balance. History In 2006, at the Bioelectromagnetics Society's annual meeting, there was a mini-symposium on electromagnetic fields and radiofrequency radiation to present the science showing biological effects, and the precautionary measures taken by countries around the world. The Bioinitiative Working Group grew out of this conference and decided to write a report on the science and health risks to alert people who could translate the science into public policy. From October 2006 to August 2007, 14 scientists and public health experts, headed by Cindy Sage and David O. Carpenter, worked to come up with recommendations for the Bioinitiative Report. Since 2007, some of the material was revised, updated and submitted for peer-reviewed publication and published in the August 2009 issue of Pathophysiology, an issue guest-edited by Martin Blank, one of the three members of the BioInitiative Organizing Committee. An updated 2012 version of the report was released on 7 January 2013. Criticism The following government health authorities and independent expert groups have reviewed the BioInitiative Report and made the following comments on the merit of its claims. Health Council of the Netherlands The Health Council of the Netherlands reviewed the BioInitiative report in September 2008 and concluded it is a selective review of existing research and does not present a balanced analysis considering the relative scientific quality of different studies. Some of the shortcomings identified included that the report made false claims as well as claims which lacked scientific basis. In 2008, they concluded: Australian Centre for Radiofrequency Bioeffects Research (ACRBR) In December 2008 the Australian Centre for Radiofrequency Bioeffects Research (ACRBR) reviewed the BioInitiative Report and concluded: The ACRBR also points out there are statements in the report that do not accord with the standard view of science, and the report does not provide a reasonable account of why we should reject the standard view in favour of the views espoused in the report. The ACRBR also noted that the state of science in this area is continually being debated and updated by a number of expert bodies composed of the leading experts in this field and strongly urged people to consult these views for a balanced assessment of the research.

A self-help author (Slater) becomes mixed up in a theft that involves a criminal (Gooding, Jr.). Plot The film begins with self-help author Wes Wilson who has recently come out with his first best selling book. At the after-party, he meets up with an attractive woman named Samantha. They flirt, and he proposes publicly. He introduces her to his agent, who tries to talk Wes into writing a sequel. Wes dismisses the agent and takes Samantha to his car to leave the party early. They are attacked in the parking lot, and Samantha is knocked out and kidnapped. Time passes slowly for Wes, who is haunted by his inability to save her. At a book signing, however, Wes also encounters Nicole, a young woman who says she is a reporter. He goes to her house for an interview, and they bond, and he enters into a relationship with her. A few more months pass and Wes and Nicole become a happy couple. Suddenly a mysterious man named Isaac who Wes had met before at the book signing, shows up and demands to know where some diamonds are. Wes runs away, and Isaac's main henchman Boone and another give chase. Wes is kidnapped as a result along with Nicole and Isaac orders him to go to some bank and empty the contents of a safety deposit box which could be the diamonds themselves. Wes finds a briefcase and then he and Nicole are released. To Isaac's surprise, there is only a stuffed toy in the briefcase and he resumes his hunt for the diamonds. Eventually, Wes gets back to his apartment, only to find Samantha there to his shock and surprise. She apologizes and tells Wes she stole the diamonds from Isaac and that Isaac won't stop until they are dead and he has the diamonds but Wes is still heartbroken that she would betray him like that as he felt guilty for not being able to help her and believed that she was dead for so long. Samantha also tells him that Nicole wants the diamonds as well and tells him to meet her under a bridge. Just then, one of Isaac's henchmen shows up, and Samantha kills him after much effort. Wes is frightened, and leaves. Isaac eventually kidnaps Wes and, using him as a lure, finds Samantha, who tells him where the diamonds are. Wes gets the diamonds, but decides to run away. Again, Isaac and his henchmen give chase, and a shootout ensues in which Boone is shot and likely killed. Isaac shoots Wes in the arm, and calmly takes the diamonds. Samantha escapes while Nicole helps Wes. Isaac is shown admiring the diamonds on his jet, when Samantha comes out of the cockpit, showing that she has shot the pilot. She shoots Isaac twice, and jumps out of the jet. The plane crashes and Isaac dies as a result. Later, Wes is talking to his agent, Martin Rivera about writing another book on his adventures, hinting it will be labeled as fiction. He thinks he sees Samantha outside, only to find it is someone else. About ready to give up, Samantha suddenly appears and uses the same pick up line he teased her with at the party at the opening of the film and they happily reunite. Boone, revealed to have survived the shootout, sits down next to Wes' agent and says he has a plan for a book about recipes for couples who are having marital troubles.

Written and produced by Terius \\"The-Dream\\" Nash and C. \\"Tricky\\" Stewart, the record was recorded by fellow recording artist and label-mate Brandy Norwood, but was given to Lopez following Norwood's departure from Epic Records. Lopez originally released the song as the lead single from her seventh studio album, Love?; however, after Lopez herself moved record labels to Island Records, the new lead single, \\"On the Floor\\", was released and \\"Louboutins\\" was not included on the album. The song uses the luxury footwear brand Louboutin as metaphor for female empowerment, with the lyrics focusing on women who need to leave their bad relationships with their heads held high. Lopez premiered \\"Louboutins\\" at the American Music Awards on November 22, 2009, where she accidentally fell on her rear-end in the middle of the performance. Ryan Seacrest and will.i.am praised Lopez's showmanship and professionalism for swiftly recovering from the fall to continue the performance. It made its radio premiere a day later on KIIS-FM's On Air with Ryan Seacrest before being sent for radio adds on December 8, 2009. \\"Louboutins\\" eventually topped the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart but failed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 as it garnered little airplay. Subsequently in 2010, Lopez announced that her ten- year partnership with Sony Music was over, making the single her last release under Epic Records. A video for the single was never filmed and further promotion of the song was cancelled.  Background  During an interview with Vibe magazine in November 2009, Tricky Stewart revealed that he was working on records for Lopez's upcoming album. He then revealed that he and The-Dream had originally produced \\"Louboutins\\" for R&B; singer Brandy Norwood. She recorded the song after her 2008 album, Human. Norwood released a statement in which she admitted that the song was once hers: \\"It is true I had a song called 'Louboutins' that I loved and still love to pieces, but God never blesses you with another person's blessing\\". Stewart later revealed that when Norwood lost her deal, the song was left over and neither he nor The-Dream wanted the record to \\"die\\". \\"Louboutins\\" was subsequently offered to Lopez, who fell in love with the song. Christian Louboutin said he was \\"flattered\\" that Lopez had recorded a song about his shoe designs and was grateful that she had asked if she was pronouncing the name correctly.  Writing and composition  \\"Louboutins\\" is a song which \\"tells the story of a woman stuck in a dead-end relationship with a man who clearly does not deserve her, and with her journey to realizing that and eventually walking out on him\\", and her frustration that her man is not 100% committed. The introduction was said to be similar to \\"4 Minutes\\" by Madonna and Justin Timberlake, though the melody is \\"backed with trumpets and synth beats\\". A reviewer from Prefix said that the record did not sound like a typical Tricky Stewart and The-Dream production. Stewart told Vibe how he and The-Dream came up with the song's concept. He said \\"That was Dream and I just getting in the room and clicking,... We were both on two different keyboards, two different drum machines and once again just got behind the mic and the rest is history.\\" Lyrics include lines like, \\"But it's the last time, I'm movin' on / I'm throwing on my Louboutins.\\" Lopez described the idea behind the song as \\"that point in a bad relationship and you're like, 'Damn, I really have to leave. It's just not good for me,' ... It's not the girl who's like, 'I'm gonna take my stuff, and I'm gonna put on my sweatpants, and I'm gonna cry,'... This girl is like putting on her hottest dress and her sexiest Louboutin shoes, and leaving your ass\\". In the chorus Lopez singles \\"I'm throwing on my Louboutins\\" eight times and overall the word \\"Louboutins\\" is spoken thirty-two times across the song. Prefix magazine said that \\"Louboutins\\" is used as a metaphor for female empowerment.  Critical reception  \\"Louboutins\\" received mixed reception from critics. Elana Gorgan of Softpedia focused on the single cover and concept of the song. She said \\"While the idea of the track is original, critics and fans alike say, the artwork is lackluster at best... There is a certain old vibe to the cover, what with the font of the writing and the shot in itself, but it's not helping the singer in any way garner much interest in the release.\\" Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly said \\"[Louboutins] does for the ultra high-end shoe brand what Crocs do for sexy.\\" She pointed out how the song was not as good as Lopez's previous material and at one point even called the song \\"Poo\\". Further to this, Peter Gicas of E! Online was also critical of the song, suggesting that the song leaked online before its official debut to warn fans of what Lopez was about to inflict on them. \\"The track begins with the singer insisting, \\"I'm taking back my love.\\" Personally, we wish we could take back the last three minutes and 49 seconds.\\" Tom Stacks of Entertainment Weekly was less than impressed saying \\"J. Lo needs to move on from her recording career. She had some fun, catchy songs ('If You Had My Love,' 'Love Don't Cost a Thing'), but trying to regain musical relevance by singing about pricey high- heels just seems a little sad. I say focus on getting the movie career back on track...\\" Becky Bain of Idolator was more positive of the song saying she \\"actually forgot Lopez is still considered a singer, what with her two-year hiatus to focus on all her fragrances and clothing lines and babies and such. It's nice to have her back‚Äîyes, not every J-Lo song was a hit, but we all danced to 'If You Had My Love' and 'Waiting for Tonight' back in the day. 'Louboutins' ... definitely has the catchiest chorus she's had in years. This could actually bring Jennifer out of the pit her last album Brave dug her into.\\" Nick Levine from Digital Spy described the track as \\"a Tricky and The- Dream-produced club banger with a chorus that succeeds through sheer attrition, with a proper Janet Jackson-style dance break. ... Truth be told, it's not a J.Lo classic to rival 'Play' or 'Love Don't Cost a Thing', and it's about as original as starting your day with a bowl of Kellogg's Cornflakes, but it does burrow into your brain after a few spins.\\"  Live performances  MTV was first to name Lopez as one of the many performers to take to the stage at the 2009 American Music Awards. which aired on November 22, 2009. She later confirmed this on a KIIS-FM interview with DJ SKEE, saying that the performance would debut her new single, \\"Louboutins\\". The performance took on a boxing theme, and featured famous ring announcer Michael Buffer introducing Lopez to the stage. Lopez performed in a boxing-like outfit and had a costume change halfway through the performance. The performance began in the ring and ended with Lopez walking through the audience. However the performance did not go as planned when the choreographed stunt of climbing a human pyramid of male dancers went wrong and she lost her balance. In E! Online's \\"Top Five Worst Concert Diggers\\", Lopez's fall was ranked at number five. Ryan Seacrest called it \\"the greatest recovery ever!\\" According to MTV, \\"the tumble was edited out of the West Coast feed of the show, out of respect for Lopez, by the show's producers\\". Becky Bain of Idolator suggested that the tumble was more talked about than the actually single itself, which was confirmed when MTV reported that it was one of the most searched things on the internet. After the incident will.i.am praised Lopez for being a true entertainer. \\"That shows she's a true entertainer and devoted, She came out of it and still rocked it. It doesn't matter how you fall ‚Äì just how you get up. She got up.\\" Lopez reprised the performance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on December 3, 2009 where she also laughed and joked about the incident. She also performed on the season six-finale of So You Think You Can Dance on December 16, 2009. The performance took on a holiday theme and was choreographed by the show's team. Lopez's final performance of the song came on December 31, 2009 where she performed \\"Louboutins\\" along with a medley of previous hits including \\"Waiting For Tonight\\" and \\"Let's Get Loud\\" at Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest. Lopez's choice of outfit, a shimmering skin-tight catsuit, received attention from the media with the NY Daily News praising her for her \\"flawless physique\\".  Music video  Christian Louboutin said that he would dedicate his time to creating some \\"scene-stealing designs for the single's video\\", out of his appreciation for the song. According to Rap-Up, Lopez was scheduled to film the music video for the song in January 2010. She outlined the concept of the video in a radio interview, where she said: \\"It's gonna be a lot of dancing, I definitely want to do some dancing because it's been a while and I want to do a dance video, and it's going to be really empowering. It's going to be about that woman, you know when you have that moment when you realize you have to really get out of here that's the moment we're trying to cauterize in the video. Even when you know that it's gonna hurt later, you feel good about making the decision, so you're like \\"I decided! I'm walking up out the house right now\\" and that's the part we're gonna do in the video except I'm gonna dance my way out the house.\\" Not long after the interview, Lopez announced her departure from Epic Records in 2010 for a new record deal.  Chart performance  \\"Louboutins\\" was to be the second consecutive song from Lopez's seventh album, Love?, to top the Hot Dance Club Songs chart following \\"Fresh Out the Oven\\", however, neither of the songs were included on the album's final track listing. According to Billboard, \\"Louboutins\\" failed to attain enough airplay to enter the Billboard charts. Later in 2010, the New York Daily News suggested that this lack of success played a role in Lopez's departure from Epic Records and Sony Music in earlier in the year.

McGannon (September 9, 1920 ‚Äì 1984) was a broadcasting industry executive during the formative years of the television industry in the United States. As chairman of the Westinghouse Broadcasting Company, McGannon was a devoted advocate of broadcasting's potential for good and worked to improve the standards of radio and television broadcasting. Early career Born September 9, 1920 in New York City, McGannon graduated from Fordham University and Fordham Law School, with a brief interruption when he enlisted in the Army and married Patricia Burke. Following law school, McGannon practiced law until 1952, when his interest in broadcasting led him to become general manager and assistant director of the DuMont Television Network. Three years later, McGannon's mentor, Chris Witting, brought McGannon to the Westinghouse Broadcasting Company as president,http://www.hospitalitynet.org/news/154000320/4020209.html a position he held for more than twenty five years. Westinghouse was, at the time, one of the largest television station ownership groups in the country. The voice of responsibility in broadcasting At Westinghouse, McGannon insisted on dropping cigarette advertising despite protests from network officials. He was also a primary force behind the ‚Äúprime-time access rule,‚Äù which the FCC instituted in 1971 in order to return a portion of each evening's prime time schedule to local stations (rather than the networks). Donald McGannon was also the principal force behind Westinghouse developing its own standards of copy and program acceptance, because he felt the NAB code standards were not sufficient. Often called an iconoclast, McGannon used his prominence in broadcasting to influence the regulations, standards, and practices of broadcasting. He was a vocal advocate of social responsibility in broadcasting and worked to educate the public through television. In 1968, Donald McGannon was awarded the Trustee Award of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, the Television Academy's highest honor, given in recognition of unusual or enduring achievements to the arts or sciences of television. Other winners of this award have included Edward R. Murrow, Bob Hope, Walter Cronkite, and Ted Turner. McGannon was also a huge influence on education, as a trustee or adviser to several universities, and was a founding director of Sacred Heart University, as well as serving on the Board of Directors of Radio Free Europe. Donald McGannon died in 1984, leaving behind his wife Patricia and 13 children. Legacy In 1986, public interest media policy advocate Everett C. Parker founded the Donald McGannon Communication Research Center http://www.fordham.edu/academics/Office_of_Research/Research_Centers__In/Donald_McGannon_Comm/ at Fordham University in honor of Donald McGannon and his commitment to social responsibility in the media. The center's mission is to conduct, support, reward, and disseminate research that informs the communications policymaking process and ethical decision-making in the management of media institutions. Each year, the McGannon Center awards the Donald McGannon Award for Social and Ethical Relevance in Communications Policy Research to the best book addressing issues of communications policy or ethics published in the previous year. Donald McGannon's legacy also lives on in the annual Donald H. McGannon Award awarded each year by the Office of Communication of the United Church of Christ to an individual who has made special contributions to advancing opportunities for women and people of color in the media, as well as in the annual Donald McGannon Award presented each year by the National Urban League to individuals who have demonstrated a commitment to ideals and beliefs in equal opportunity.

Early career and rise to fame T√°bori was born in Ko≈°ice. Although he had already taken up running in his youth, his serious career only started in the early 1950s under Mih√°ly Igl√≥i, the legendary coach of T√°bori's club, Honv√©d Budapest. Already part of the world-record-breaking 1953 and 1954 4 x 1500 metres relay teams of Hungary and the Honv√©d Budapest club respectively, he exploded to international fame in 1955, together with Igl√≥i's other star pupils, S√°ndor Iharos and Istv√°n R√≥zsav√∂lgyi. On May 28, 1955, he became only the third man in the world to run a four-minute mile, running 3:59.0 and soundly beating both Chris Chataway and Brian Hewson. (For more than twenty years, he and R√≥zsav√∂lgyi would remain the only Hungarians to run a four-minute mile.) On September 6, he equalled the 1500 metres world record (set just a month earlier by Iharos) with a time of 3:40.8. 1956 Melbourne Olympics The 1956 Melbourne Olympics occurred at a psychologically unfortunate time for team Hungary, as the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 had just been bloodily crushed by the Soviet military. (This was all the worse as Honv√©d Budapest was at that time the sports club of the Hungarian army.) The effects of this were obvious. Iharos missed out on the Olympics entirely, ostensibly due to a minor ankle injury but quite probably because of the revolution, and R√≥zsav√∂lgyi shockingly went out in the 1500 m heats. T√°bori did much better by comparison; expected to medal, he still finished a very respectable 4th in the 1500 metres and 6th in the 5000 metres. At the close of the Melbourne Games, T√°bori decided to defect to the West with his coach, Mih√°ly Igl√≥i. He soon left for the United States and settled in California, where he remained for the rest of his life. Coaching career T√°bori returned to distance running as a coach in 1967, his training methods based directly on Igl√≥i's. He coached the now defunct program at Los Angeles Valley College to three state championships and coached the San Fernando Valley Track Club since 1973. He was a vocal advocate of interval training. His most notable pupil was Jacqueline Hansen, who ran two world records in the marathon. Miki Gorman also ran a world record in the marathon. He continued coaching at the University of Southern California, coaching among others, Duane Solomon.https://usctrojans.com/coaches.aspx?rc=603&path;=track Death T√°bori died on May 23, 2018, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.

It was never particularly common at Rome, but may have been used more frequently in the countryside. The feminine form is Fausta. The name was not usually abbreviated, but is occasionally found abbreviated F. During the period of the Roman Empire, it was widely used as a cognomen, or surname. As the Roman nomenclature system began to break down towards the end of the Western Empire in the 4th and 5th centuries, Faustus once again became a personal name, and it has survived into modern times.Realencyclop√§die der Classischen AltertumswissenschaftMika Kajava, Roman Female Praenomina: Studies in the Nomenclature of Roman Women (1994) The best-known examples of this praenomen are from the family of the dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla, who in 81 B.C. named his twin children Faustus and Fausta. The name continued to be used regularly by his descendants over the next two centuries. Other gentes from which examples are known include the Antistii, Decimii, Lartii, Paccii, Veidii, and Vibii; and perhaps also the Julii, Servii, and Sestii. Varro described this praenomen as obsolete in the 1st century BC, implying that it had once been more common; but it seems that by reviving it in his own family, Sulla may have started a trend which continued for some centuries, and probably also contributed to the popularity of the name as a cognomen. Origin and meaning The meaning of Faustus is fortunate or lucky, a fact which probably inspired Sulla, who considered himself blessed by fortune. Indeed, this may have been the motivation behind many of the parents who gave this rare praenomen to their children. Another interesting example mentioned in the Realencyclop√§die der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft was of two brothers named Faustus and Fortunatus. However, Fortunatus probably was not a genuine praenomen, but was chosen on that occasion simply because it was a synonym of Faustus.

These include the representation of different language systems in the brain, the effects of multilingualism on the brain's structural plasticity, aphasia in multilingual individuals, and bimodal bilinguals (people who can speak one sign language and one oral language). Neurological studies of multilingualism are carried out with functional neuroimaging, electrophysiology, and through observation of people who have suffered brain damage. The brain contains areas that are specialized to deal with language, located in the perisylvian cortex of the left hemisphere. These areas are crucial for performing language tasks, but they are not the only areas that are used; disparate parts of both right and left brain hemispheres are active during language production. In multilingual individuals, there is a great deal of similarity in the brain areas used for each of their languages. Insights into the neurology of multilingualism have been gained by the study of multilingual individuals with aphasia, or the loss of one or more languages as a result of brain damage. Bilingual aphasics can show several different patterns of recovery; they may recover one language but not another, they may recover both languages simultaneously, or they may involuntarily mix different languages during language production during the recovery period. These patterns are explained by the dynamic view of bilingual aphasia, which holds that the language system of representation and control is compromised as a result of brain damage. Research has also been carried out into the neurology of bimodal bilinguals, or people who can speak one oral language and one sign language. Studies with bimodal bilinguals have also provided insight into the tip of the tongue phenomenon, working memory, and patterns of neural activity when recognizing facial expressions, signing, and speaking.  Overview   Centralization of language areas in the brain  Language acquisition in multilingual individuals is contingent on two factors: age of the language acquisition and proficiency. Specialization is centered in the perisylvian cortex of the left hemisphere. Various regions of both the right and left hemisphere activate during language production. Multilingual individuals consistently demonstrate similar activation patterns in the brain when using either one of the two or more languages they fluently know. Age of acquiring the second-or-higher language, and proficiency of use determine what specific brain regions and pathways activate when using (thinking or speaking) the language. In contrast to those who acquired their multiple languages at different points in their life, those who acquire multiple languages when young, and at virtually the same time, show similar activations in parts of Broca's area and left inferior frontal lobe. If the second-or-higher language is acquired later in life, specifically after the critical period, the language becomes centralized in a different part of Broca's area than the native language and other languages learned when young.  Brain plasticity in multilingualism  A greater density of grey matter in the inferior parietal cortex is present in multilingual individuals. It has been found that multilingualism affects the structure, and essentially, the cytoarchitecture of the brain. Learning multiple languages re-structures the brain and some researchers argue that it increases the brain's capacity for plasticity. Language learning boosts brain plasticity and the brain's ability to code new information. Early language learning plays a significant role in the formation of memory circuits for learning new information. Most of these differences in brain structures in multilinguals may be genetic at the core. Consensus is still muddled; it may be a mixture of both‚Äîexperiential (acquiring languages during life) and genetic (predisposition to brain plasticity). Experience can change both the function and the structure of the brain. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) reflect synchronized postsynaptic activity in cortical pyramidal neurons. ERPs can be used to track learning-related changes in brain function. Semantic anomalies elicit a negative wave which suggests the separation between semantic and syntactic processing Heightened brain plasticity in infants impacts later language development. Recent studies show that even brief exposure to a language in infancy changes how the brain processes a second-language acquisition. Participants in the studies who had transient language exposure as an infant or were multilingual showed greater brain activation in non-verbal working memory patterns, compared to monolingual speakers. The measure of uncommitted neural circuitry in infants can be accounted for in the perception of nonnative language at early stages of language acquisition. Research has shown that infants who show proficiency in nonnative phonetic perception at 7 months have slower language development than those who show proficiency in native phonetic perception. This research supports the Native Language Magnet/Neural Commitment Theory originally proposed by Patricia K. Kuhl.  Aphasia in multilingualism  Insights into language storage in the brain have come from studying multilingual individuals afflicted with a form of aphasia. The symptoms and severity of aphasia in multilingual individuals depend on the number of languages the individual knows, what order they learned them, and thus have them stored in the brain, the age at which they learned them, how frequently each language is used, and how proficient the individual is in using those languages. Two primary theoretical approaches to studying and viewing multilingual aphasics exist‚Äîthe localizationalist approach and the dynamic approach. The localizationalist approach views different languages as stored in different regions of the brain, explaining why multilingual aphasics may lose one language they know, but not the other(s). The dynamical theory (or shared representation) approach suggests that the language system is supervised by a dynamic equilibrium between the existing language capabilities and the constant alteration and adaptation to the communicative requirements of the environment. The dynamic approach views the representation and control aspects of the language system as compromised as a result of brain damage to the brain's language regions.Paradis, M. (1998). Language and communication in multilinguals. In B. Stemmer & H. Whitaker (Eds.), Handbook of neurolinguistics (pp. 417‚Äì430). San Diego, CA: Academic Press. The dynamic approach offers a satisfactory explanation for the various recovery times of each of the languages the aphasic has had impaired or lost because of the brain damage. Recovery of languages varies across aphasic patients. Some may recover all lost or impaired languages simultaneously. For some, one language is recovered before the others. In others, an involuntary mix of languages occurs in the recovery process; they intermix words from the various languages they know when speaking. Research affirms with the two approaches combined into the amalgamated hypothesis, it states that while languages do share some parts of the brain, they can also be allotted to some separate areas that are neutral. Aphasia in multilinguals (or bilinguals) is commonly assessed through a Bilingual Aphasia Test (or BAT). The BAT consists of 3 sections that patients are required to answer with continuously as the test administrators record their answers. Patients' performances are then documented and processed with computer programs that determine the percentages of correctness given the specific linguistic skill. With the BAT many clinical settings have a standardized system of determining the extent of aphasia in the multilingual patients.  PET scan studies on bimodal individuals  Neuroscientific research on bimodal individuals‚Äîthose who speak one oral language and one sign language‚Äîhas been carried out. PET scans from these studies show that there is a separate region in the brain for working memory related to sign language production and use. These studies also find that bimodal individuals use different areas of the right hemisphere depending on whether they are speaking using verbal language or gesticulating using sign language. Studies with bimodal bilinguals have also provided insight into the tip of the tongue phenomenon and into patterns of neural activity when recognizing facial expressions.  Role of the executive control system in preventing cross talk  There are sophisticated mechanisms to prevent cross talk in brains where more than one language is stored. The executive control system might be implicated to prevent one language from interfering with another in multilinguals. The executive control system is responsible for processes that are sometimes referred to as executive functions, and among others includes supervisory attentional system, or cognitive control. Although most research on the executive control system pertains to nonverbal tasks, there is some evidence that the system might be involved in resolving and ordering the conflict generated by the competing languages stored in the multilingual's brain. During speech production there is a constant need to channel attention to the appropriate word associated with the concept, congruent with the language being used. The word must be placed in the appropriate phonological and morphological context.Costa, A. \\"Executive control in Bilingual contexts.\\" Brainglot. http://brainglot.upf.edu/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=86 . Multilinguals constantly utilize the general executive control system to resolve interference/conflicts among the known languages, enhancing the system's functional performance, even on nonverbal tasks. In studies, multilingual subjects of all ages showed overall enhanced executive control abilities. This may indicate that the multilingual experience leads to a transfer of skill from the verbal to the nonverbal. There is no one specific domain of language modulation in the general executive control system, as far as studies reveal. Studies show that the speed with which multilingual subjects perform tasks, with and without mediation required to resolve language-use conflict, is better in bilingual than monolingual subjects.  Health benefits of multilingualism and bilingualism  Despite the growth of multilingualism in different parts of the world, there are controversies on the positive and negative impacts of bilingualism on the education of children. Studies have brought part of the answer to frequent questions such as: are bilingual children distressed? Does multilingualism make children smarter? Defenders of multilingualism assert that speaking another language contributes to an intelligent and healthy brain whereas opponents of multilingualism vehemently insist that speaking another language does not make children smarter and that on the contrary, it can disturb their learning journey. Researcher Ellen Bialystok examined the effect of multilingualism on Alzheimer's disease and found that it delays its onset by about 4 years. The researcher's study found that those who spoke two or more languages showed symptoms of Alzheimer's disease at a later time than speakers of a single language. The study found that the more languages the multilingual knows, the later the onset of Alzheimer's disease. Multilingualism aids in the building up of cognitive reserves in the brain; these cognitive reserves force the brain to work harder‚Äîthey, themselves, restructure the brain.Peterson, R. (2011). \\"Benefits of Being Bilingual\\". Multilingualism leads to greater efficiency of use in the brain, and organizes the brain to be more efficient and conservative in using energy. More research is required to determine whether learning another language later in life has the same protective effects; nonetheless, it is evident from the variety of studies performed on the effects of multilingualism and bilingualism on the brain, that learning and knowing multiple languages sets the stage for a cognitive healthy life.  Neural representation in the bilingual brain   Functional neuroimaging and language organization in the human brain  Work in the field of cognitive neuroscience has located classical language areas within the perislyvian cortex of the left hemisphere. This area is crucial for the representation of language, but other areas in the brain are shown to be active in this function as well. Language-related activation occurs in the middle and inferior temporal gyri, the temporal pole, the fusiform gyri, the lingula, in the middle prefrontal areas (i.e. dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), and in the insula. There also appears to be activation in the right hemisphere during most language tasks. Language-related areas are dedicated to certain components of language processing (e.g. lexical semantics). These areas are functionally characterized by linguistically pertinent systems, such as phonology, syntax, and lexical semantics‚Äîand not in speaking, reading, and listening. In the normal human brain, areas associated with linguistic processing are less rigid than previously thought. For example, increased familiarity with a language has been found to lead to decreases in brain activation in left dorsolateral frontal cortex (Brodmann areas, 9, 10, 46).  Language production in bilinguals  Bilingualism involves the use of two languages by an individual or community. Neuroimaging studies of bilingualism generally focus on a comparison of activated areas when using the first language (L1) and second language (L2). Studies of language production which employ functional neuroimaging methods, investigate the cerebral representation of language activity in bilinguals. These methods (i.e. PET and fMRI) separate subjects mainly on basis of age of L2 acquisition and not on proficiency level in L2. With the use of PET in the study of late learners, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) distribution has been found to be comparable between L1 and L2. Repetition of words engages overlapping neural structures across both languages; whereas, differences in neural activation are only observed in the left putamen when individuals repeat words in their second language. The putamen, therefore, plays a critical role because the articulation process places greater demand on brain resources, when one is producing a second language learned late in life. Word generation tasks including rhyme generation (phonological bases), synonym generation (semantic search bases), and translation (lexical access to other language) are used to observe lexical-semantics. Word generation has been shown to cause significant activation in the left dorsolateral frontal cortex (Brodmann areas 9, 45, 46, 47). Considerable overlie has been found in the frontal areas, regardless of task requirements (rhymes or synonyms) and language used (L1 or L2). Selective activation is observed in the left putamen when words are generated in the second language (i.e. increased rCBF in left putamen resulting from L2-L1 subtractions). Even when the second language is acquired later in life (up to age five), L2 production in highly proficient bilinguals reveals activation of similar brain regions as that in L1. Word generation (phonemic verbal fluency) has also led to larger foci of brain activation for the least fluent language(s) within multilinguals (observed using fMRI). Regardless of language, however, activation is principally found in the left prefrontal cortex (inferior frontal, middle frontal, and precentral gyri). Additionally, activation can be observed in the supplementary motor area and parietal lobe. This activation is larger for L3 than L2 and L1, and less for L1 than for L2. Familiarity with a language reduces the brain activation required for its use. = Age of second language acquisition = Language acquisition appears to play a large role in the cortical organization involved in second language processing. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), representations of L1 and L2 have been found in spatially isolated parts of the left inferior frontal cortex of late learners (Broca's area). For early learners, similar parts of Broca's area are activated for both language‚Äîwhereas later learners have shown to use different parts of Broca's area. In contrast, there is overlap in active regions of L1 and L2 within Wernicke's area, regardless of age of L2 acquisition. = Effects of language proficiency on L2 cortical representation = Conversely, it has also been reported that there is at times, no difference within the left prefrontal cortex when comparing word generation in early bilinguals and late bilinguals. It has been reported that these findings may conflict with those stated above because of different levels of proficiency in each language. That is, an individual who resides in a bilingual society is more likely to be highly proficient in both languages, as opposed to a bilingual individual who lives in a dominantly monolingual community. Thus, language proficiency is another factor affecting the neuronal organization of language processing in bilinguals. With the use of positron emission tomography (PET), research has shown that brain regions active during translation are outside classical language areas. Translating from L1 to L2 and vice versa activates the anterior cingulate and bilateral subcortical structures (i.e. putamen and head of caudate nucleus). This pattern is explained in terms of the need for greater coordination of mental operations. More specifically, automated circuits are favoured over cerebral pathways for naming words. Language switching is another task in which brain activation is high in Broca's area and the supramarginal gyrus. This was originally observed by Poetzl, (1925, 1930) and Leischner, (1943)‚Äîall of whom reported that patients with supramarginal lesions were defective in switching languages. Areas of the brain associated with phonological working memory have been shown to have greater activation in bilinguals proficient in both languages using fMRI. Equally proficient bilinguals use working memory more than bilinguals who have unequal proficiency. This suggests that optimal use of phonological working memory, specifically the left insula and left inferior frontal gyrus, is associated with higher second language acquisition. = Linguistic fluency = Most studies involving neuroimaging investigations of language production in bilinguals employ tasks that require single word processing‚Äîpredominantly in the form of word generation (fluency) tasks. Fluency tasks show substantial activation of the left dorsolateral frontal cortex. Phonemic verbal fluency (initial letter fluency) activates the left inferior frontal gyrus, and the posterior frontal operculum (Ba 44). Semantic fluency, however, engages discrete activation of anterior frontal regions (Brodmann areas 45 and 46). Functional neuroimaging research has shown that very early bilinguals display no difference in brain activation for L1 and L2‚Äîwhich is assumed to be due to high proficiency in both languages. Additionally, in highly proficient late bilinguals, there is a common neural network that plays an important role in language production tasks; whereas, in late bilinguals, spatially separated regions are activated in Broca's area for L1 and L2. Finally, it has been found that larger cerebral activation is measured when a language is spoken less fluently than when languages are spoken fluently. Overall, in bilinguals/polyglots, achieved proficiency, and possibly language exposure, are more crucial than age of acquisition in the cerebral representation of languages. However, since age of acquisition has a strong effect on the likelihood of achieving high fluency, these variables are strongly intertwined.  Language comprehension in bilinguals  Research generally supports the belief that language comprehension in the bilingual brain is malleable. Listening to stories in L1 and L2 results in largely dissimilar patterns of neural activity in low proficiency bilinguals‚Äîregardless of age of acquisition. Some researchers propose that the amount to which one masters L2 is accountable for the measured differences between groups of early and late learners. Specifically, in terms of auditory language comprehension for proficient bilinguals who have acquired L2 after ten years of age (late learners), the activated neural areas are similar for both languages. However, as already noted, there are fewer individuals becoming highly proficient at later ages of acquisition. Language comprehension research on bilinguals used fMRI techniques. Groups of two orthographically and phonologically outlying languages (English and Mandarin) were the basis of analysis. Sentence comprehension was measured through visually presented stimuli, showing significant activation in several key areas: the left inferior and middle frontal gyri, the left superior and middle temporal gyri, the left temporal pole, the anterior supplementary motor area, and bilateral representation of the superior parietal regions and occipital regions. Also, brain activation of these two orthographically and phonologically outlying languages showed striking overlap (i.e. the direct contrast did not indicate significant differences). Single word comprehension using L1 generated greater activation in the temporal pole than comprehension of words in L2. Language comprehension studies of bilinguals using neuroimaging give more conclusive results than production studies.  General findings  Functional neuroimaging methods such as PET and fMRI are used to study the complex neural mechanisms of the human language systems. Functional neuroimaging is used to determine the most important principles of cerebral language organization in bilingual persons. Based on the evidence we can conclude that the bilingual brain is not the addition of two monolingual language systems, but operates as a complex neural network that can differ across individuals. The bilingual language system is affected by specific factors of which proficiency appears to be the most important. Evidence, mentioned previously, has shown that differential cerebral activation in anterior brain structures (e.g. Ba and the basal ganglia) is related to poor performance on word generation and production. With regards to language comprehension, differences in levels of language proficiency engage the temporal lobes (particularly the temporal pole). Where in the least proficient language, more cerebral activation is related to speech production, less activation is related to comprehending the least proficient language. Age of acquisition is not as important in comprehension activities as it is in production activities. However, that is not to say that age of acquisition is not a major factor in the proficiency of L2. In fact studies have determined late learners to be less proficient in L2 than early learners. Functional imaging methods have revealed that holding proficiency constant leads to age of acquisition not having a large influence on representation of L2 in the brain, but there are fewer individuals achieving high proficiency at later ages of acquisition.  Structural plasticity  Second language proficiency and age at acquisition affect grey matter density in the brain. The human ability to learn multiple languages is a skill thought to be mediated by functional (rather than structural) plastic changes in the brain. Learning a second language is said to increase grey matter density in the left inferior parietal cortex, and the amount of structural reorganization in this region is modulated by the proficiency attained and the age at acquisition. It has been suggested that this relation between grey matter density and performance denotes a general principle of brain organization. There is an increase in grey matter density in the left inferior parietal cortex of bilinguals compared to that in monolinguals. Grey matter density is more prominent in early bilinguals than it is in late bilinguals. Evidence has also shown that density in this region increases with second language proficiency and is negatively correlated with age of acquisition. It has also been shown that bilingualism affects the white matter of the brain, expressed as increased myelination of a series of white matter tracts, including the corpus callosum, in sequential adult bilinguals that are active users of their second language. It is thought that these effects are due to the cognitively demanding skill of handling more than one languages, which requires more efficient connectivity between areas in the grey matter of the brain. Similar effects have been found in lifelong elderly bilinguals and simultaneous bilingual children. It is debated whether the above-mentioned effects are the result of a genetic predisposition to increased density, rather than experience-related structural reorganization. A second language is likely acquired through social experience, in early bilinguals, rather than through genetic predisposition. Thus, the research suggests that the structure of the human brain is reworked by the experience of acquiring a second language. This theory is also consistent with growing evidence that the human brain changes structurally due to environmental demands. For instance, it has been established that structure is altered as a consequence of learning in domains independent of language. As to structural plasticity induced by bilingualism, it has recently been shown that bilinguals, as compared to monolinguals, have increased grey matter density in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The ACC is a brain structure that helps subjects to monitor their actions and it is part of the attentional and executive control system. Bilinguals have increased grey matter in this brain area because they continuously monitor their languages in order to avoid unwanted language interferences from the language not in use. The continuous use of the ACC in turn induces plastic neural effects. This may be the same reason why bilinguals are faster than monolinguals on many attentional control tasks.  Bilingual aphasia  Bilingual aphasia is a specific form of aphasia which affects one or more languages of a bilingual (or multilingual) individual. As of 2001, 45,000 new cases of bilingual aphasia are predicted annually in the United States.Paradis, M. (2001). Bilingual and polyglot aphasia. In R. S. Berndt (Ed.), Handbook of neuropsychology (2nd ed.) Language and aphasia (Vol. 3, pp. 69‚Äì91). Amsterdam: Elsevier Science. The main factors influencing the outcomes of bilingual aphasia are the number of languages spoken and the order in which they are learned‚Äîboth influenced by the pattern of daily use and expertise in each language before the onset of aphasia. The type and severity of the aphasia, the location and size of the lesions, as well as the patient's levels of education and literacy also influence the functional outcomes of bilingual aphasia.  Lateralization  Previously, research has revolved around the hypothesis that language in bilingual individuals is more symmetrically represented in the brain, where the symmetrical representation in the cerebral hemispheres can be attributed to differential localization of the languages. Thus, if one of the languages is heavily represented in the right hemisphere, it can then be partially represented in a different locus, and this has been the explanation to some nonparallel recovery patterns. Based on further studies with communication deficits associated with right hemisphere lesions, it can be safely assumed that the right hemisphere is crucial to processing the pragmatics of using languages. With bilinguals, they are likely to compensate for their gaps in linguistic understandings in their weaker language by increasing reliance on their pragmatics. Therefore, it is highly expect that they will be involving the use of the right hemisphere to allow this process, and thus further supporting the notion of lateralization of multiple languages. There are two proposed theoretical views generally taken to approach bilingual aphasia. The more traditional Localizationist view, states that the loss of one language occurs because the patient's languages are represented in different brain areas or in different hemispheres. Thus, if one area is damaged, only the language represented there would suffer, and the others would not. The second view is the Dynamic view of selective language recovery, which proposes that the language system of representation and control is compromised as a result of damage. This theory is supported by the functional imaging data of normal bilinguals and holds that fluency in a language is lost because of an increase in the activation threshold. The Dynamic view offers an explanation for selective recovery of language and many reported recovery patterns in bilingual aphasia (See Recovery) There is much debate over which hemisphere supports the languages and which intrahemispheric neural regions represent each language within a bilingual individual. Most neuroimaging studies show no laterality differences between monolingual and bilingual speakers, supporting the hypothesis that languages share some areas of the brain, but also have some separate neural areas. Right hemisphere damage has been shown to result in the same patterns of cognitive- communication deficits in monolinguals and bilinguals; however, bilingual speakers who have left hemisphere damage are shown to be at risk for aphasia while monolingual individuals are not.  Bilingual Aphasia Test  In the past, the assessment of aphasia in bilinguals or multilinguals was only available in the language of the hospital. This was problematic because the professionals performing these assessments often misjudged the patient's recovery progress in the non native languages of the professional. To solve this issue, The Bilingual Aphasia Test (BAT) was developed by Michel Paradis and associates. The test was developed as an instrument to assess aphasia with more accuracy. The test is available in many different languages and is designed to be equivalent in its content, and not merely translations of each other. Components of linguistic construction of some languages do not directly translate to other languages (i.e. passive in English). Therefore, the tests are designed to be culturally and linguistically equivalent. The goal of the tests is to tap into the same information in different languages with respect to the rationale that motivated the constructions. The BAT consists of 3 major sections, each listed as Part A, Part B, and Part C. Patients are required to take each section accordingly. Part B examines language performance in 4 modalities: hearing, speaking, reading, and writing. At the word, sentence, and paragraph level, the patient is tested on level of linguistic skill (phonological, morphological, syntactic, lexical, semantic). Part C is used to assess the ability of the subject to translate material between given pairs of their known languages. There are currently 65 available languages for Part B and 160 language pairs available for Part C. The specifics and associated cultures of each languages were accounted for and the materials of these sections were adapted accordingly rather than being directly translated. An example follows where, in a Friulian and English pair, the English stimuli included ‚Äúmat, cat, bat, hat‚Äù and the Friulian counterpart (which included 4 words that differed solely by one initial phoneme) was represented as ‚Äú‚Äòcjoc, c¬∏oc, poc, toc‚Äô (drunk, log, chicory, piece).‚Äù The response of the patients are recorded and processed with computer programs that indicate the percentage of correct answers for each linguistic skill. Thus, with the BAT, the assessment of bilingual aphasia allows a direct comparison of the knowledge and performance of each of the patient‚Äôs languages to determine the severity of the aphasia.  Recovery  The concept of different recovery patterns was first noted by Albert Pitres in 1895. Since then, seven patterns have been outlined, where differential recovery, alternating recovery, alternating antagonistic recovery, and blended recovery were additionally noted by Michel Paradis: # Selective recovery ‚Äì one language remains impaired and the other recovers; the activation threshold for the impaired language is permanently increased # Parallel recovery of both languages (i.e., when both impaired languages improve to a similar extent and concurrently); # Successive recovery (i.e., when complete recovery of one language precedes the recovery of the other); # Differential recovery ‚Äì occurs when there is greater inhibition of one language than of another # Alternating recovery (i.e., the language that was first recovered will be lost again due to the recovery of the language that was not first recovered); # Alternating antagonistic recovery ‚Äì in which the language that was not used for a time becomes the currently used language (i.e., on one day the patient is able to speak in one language while the next day only in the other); and # Blended recovery ‚Äì Pathological mixing of two languages (i.e., the elements of the two languages are involuntarily mixed during language production) These patterns arise due to the state of the cerebral substrate. Research has proposed that it is not due to the cerebral substrate being physically destroyed, but due to its weakened state that has led to the different forms of inhibition. This weakening of the system has been tied to the idea of increased inhibition, which is when the threshold in activation for that system rises unnaturally due to damage. This leads to languages being inhibited in various was, and thus, resulting in variations in the recovery, and sometimes non-recovery, of the languages. Research that compares the prevalence of the different recovery patterns generally shows that the most common pattern of recovery is parallel recovery, followed by differential, blended, selective, and successive. In regards to differential recovery, better recovery of L1 is shown to be slightly more common than better recovery of L2. In 1977, it was proposed that when the effects of age, proficiency, context of acquisition, and type of bilingualism are combined, the recovery pattern of a bilingual aphasic can be properly predicted. It has recently been reported that language status (how frequently the language is used in comparison to other languages), lesion type or site, the context in which the languages were used, the type of aphasia, and the manner in which the language could not reliably predict recovery patterns. In comparison to monolinguals, bilinguals have shown to have a better recovery after stroke. As with Alzheimer's patients, bilingual patients who have suffered an ischemic stroke have shown to have a better cognitive outcome which researchers believe is due to a higher cognitive reserve. This increase of cognitive reserve might be attributed to the increase of grey matter in bilingual individuals. Since bilingual individuals have to constantly change and inhibit a language, the brain is more used to brain training and has been able to optimize better the space it uses. Brain training has led researchers to believe is a factor that helps stroke patients recover faster and better. Bilingual individuals then are able to benefit more from rehabilitation after stroke compared to monolingual patients because the brain has a higher plasticity ability that allows for a better remodeling of the brain after stroke. Stroke patients (bilinguals) with aphasia also perform better in other cognitive tasks that measure attention and ability to organize and retrieve information. This is attributed again to the increase of grey matter since it is involved in cognitive control and higher cognitive functions that are more present in bilinguals. This is relevant since in some patients the automatization of language is impaired, highly correlated to basal ganglia lesions and anterior parietal cortex. Although it is uncommon for patients to lose automatization of the first language, basal ganglia lesions have been correlated to loss of automatization of language, which fits with the role of basal ganglia in automatized motor and cognitive performance. This is more evident with patients who have acquired a second language at a later age since studies suggest that late bilingual aphasics' syntactic judgment abilities may be more impaired for the second language. Acquisition of language at a later age changes the mapping of language in the brain since the languages do not overlap. This difference in mapping seems to be a contributing factor in recovery for patients with bilingual aphasia since there are second language- restricted zones that are dedicated to the first language. Nonetheless, age of acquisition also shows to be a factor in the degree of recovery of stroke patients due to differences in language mapping and the amount of grey matter developed. Studies have shown stroke patients are able to benefit more from rehabilitation and recover faster if they have acquired a new skill that requires high cognitive ability due to more extensive brain training. This is true also for patients who have acquired a new skill at a later age. Nonetheless, stroke patients who have acquired a skill (second language in this case) early on have a higher chance of recovery than those who acquired i.e. language later on. This is again attributed to the higher grey matter area that those with early acquisition have developed.  The bimodal bilingual brain  Bimodal bilinguals are individuals who are fluent in both sign language and oral language. The effect of this language experience on the brain compared to brain regions in monolinguals or bilinguals of oral languages has only recently become a research interest, but is now used to provide insight on syntactic integration and language control of bilinguals. PET scans of a 37-year-old, right handed, bilingual (English and American Sign Language) male with left frontal lobe damage revealed evidence of increased right hemisphere activity compared to normal controls during spontaneous generation of narrative in both English and American Sign Language (ASL). Research with fMRI has found that showing sign language to deaf and hearing signers and showing written English to hearing non-signers activates the classical language areas of the left hemisphere in both cases. Studies in this area generally compare the behaviour or brain activity in normally hearing monolingual speakers of an oral language, genetically deaf, native signers, and normally hearing bimodal bilinguals. With the use of functional Near-Infrared Imaging (fNIR), Kovelman (2009) compared the performance and brain activity of these three groups in picture-naming tasks. These researchers found that, although performance in all groups was similar, neuroimaging revealed that bilinguals showed greater signal intensity within the posterior temporal regions (Wernicke's area) while using both languages in rapid alternation than when they were only using one language.  Working memory  PET studies have revealed a language modality-specific working memory neural region for sign language (which relies on a network of bilateral temporal, bilateral parietal, and left premotor activation), as well as a difference in activation of the right cerebellum in bimodal bilinguals between when they are signing or speaking. Similarities of activation have been found in Broca's area and semantic retrieval causes similar patterns of activation in the anterior left inferior frontal lobe. The bilateral parietal activation pattern for sign language is similar to neural activity during nonverbal visuospatial tasks.  Face recognition  Sign language and oral language experience in bimodal bilinguals are shown to have separate effects on activation patterns within the superior temporal sulcus when recognizing facial expressions. Additionally, hearing signers (individuals who can hear and also speak sign language) do not show the strong left-lateralizated activation for facial expression recognition that has been found within deaf signers. This indicates that both sign language experience and deafness can affect the neural organization for recognizing facial expressions.

The newspaper published a series of twenty one consecutive daily articles, edited by Herbert Bayard Swope, that discussed numerous aspects of Ku Klux Klan including rituals, recruitment methods, propaganda, and hypocrisies in logic. At least fifteen other newspapers nationwide picked up the coverage, which led to national discourse on the activities of the group. These publications included The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Boston Globe, Pittsburgh Sun, The Plain Dealer (Cleveland), New Orleans Times-Picayune, Galveston News, Houston Chronicle, Seattle Times, Milwaukee Journal, Minneapolis Journal, Oklahoma City Oklahoman, Toledo Blade, Fort Wayne News-Sentinel, Syracuse Herald, Columbus Enquirer-SunLoyless, Thomas W, and Julian Harris. \\"Ad for Columbus Enquirer- Sun.\\" Atlanta Constitution 11 Sep 1921: G5.

Print. while other large papers like the Baltimore Sun quickly picked up the article series instead of advertising for The World.\\"The New Ku Klux Klan.\\" Baltimore Sun 07 Sep 1921: 6. Print. The Ku Klux Klan announced shortly afterward that it would take legal action against all the publications that ran the article series for libel, seeking total damages of over ten million dollars. September 6, 1921 The first article was titled \\"Ku Klux Klan Wars on Catholics, Jews; Reap Rich Returns\\" ‚Äì \\"Nationwide Investigation of Secret Order Shows It Gains Great Power by Winning Officials as Members ‚Äì Fortune is Collected in Initiation Dues\\". The first article posed many questions to draw in readers regarding how the Klan works, and offered that it would explain all in its series. It expounded on the increase in membership past 500,000 in recent years, and it described an expanded interest from being anti-African American to being an anti-Catholic, and anti-Jewish group as well. The Klan accomplished this by barring membership to these groups. It also reveals that the Klan used salesman, called Kleagles, to try to recruit members that require $10 donations, $4 of which goes to the Kleagle, and the rest to the organization. It estimates that at the time, the Klan had raised over five million dollars, all to support the 'invisible empire'. The article condemns acts committed by the Klan used by these funds on moral grounds, and explains that its series will tell all that it could find after months of investigation. September 7, 1921 The second article was titled \\"Ku Klux Officer Exposes Alleged Frauds of Order\\" ‚Äì \\"Captain Fry Voluntarily Resign Positions, Denounces Organization as 'Un-American, Conceived in Avarice, Sired in Ignorance, and Damned in Greed'.\\" The article focused on a resignation letter written to the Klan by a former Kleagle, Henry P. Fry, condemning the Klan due to conflict with their activities on moral grounds and the Klan's oath's conflict with his oath to the United States Army. September 8, 1921 The third article was titled \\"Ku Klux Klan Plot Alleged to Reach Army and Navy\\" ‚Äì \\"Officers Club in New York Used for Mail Headquarters for Membership Solicitors ‚Äì Men in Service Invited to Join Secret Order.\\" The article focused on correspondence among the Klan and members of the Army and Navy Club in New York City through a semi-secret mailbox (an abnormality for mail at the club) to recruit potential prospects in the armed services. The Klan used its message of one hundred percent Americanism to draw in individuals in the military. September 9, 1921 The fourth article was titled \\"Clarkes' Own Roster Shows 'Kleagles' In Nearly All States\\" ‚Äì \\"Letter Sent Simmons by His Chief Aide Declared That Secrets of Order Were Safe from Exposure\\" The article discusses the sales management aspects of the Klan through using Kleages as door to door salesmen. It discusses how the Klan believed their headquarters in each area that they recruited in was secret at the time, and that individuals would be hard pressed to find them. The World was able to obtain information on all the Klan's employees, totaling over 214 members within their sales operations. September 10, 1921 The fifth article was titled \\"Simmons Gives Klan Ritual to 'Aliens' by Copyright Kloran\\" ‚Äì \\"Wizardry 'Colonel' Displays in Guarding Treasure of Order Surpasses All for Sheer Clumsiness.\\" The article discusses the promotion of the Klan as an extremely secret society to potential members, so much that Klan members don't tell their closest relationships of their membership. It discusses the ritual oaths of the Kloran, which once guarded as secret were provided by Joseph Simmons with his decision to copyright the Kloran. This made the book available for reading at the Library of Congress. September 11, 1921 The sixth article was titled \\"Klux Klan Ritual Indicates Simmons Indulges in Poetry\\" ‚Äì \\"Imperial Wizard Adopts Holland's Familiar Lines and Overlooks Crediting to Author Long Gone.\\" The article discusses part of the poems used within Klan rituals as well as prayers and statements during the rituals that exalt and praise the Imperial Wizard. The article reveals that Simmons stole most of a poem by a New York City poet Josiah Gilbert Holland for one section of the Kloran. September 12, 1921 The seventh article was titled \\"Christian Baptism Ceremony Parodied in Klux Klan Ritual\\" ‚Äì \\"Initiation Made Imposing to Impress Credulous Candidates Who Join Imperial Wizard Simmons' Hordes.\\" The article describes the similarities of Christian Baptism that was performed in initiation ceremonies for the Klan. Initiates were interrogated about their allegiances and asked some hypothetical questions regarding their allegiance, then doused in water similar to a Baptism. During this part of the ritual, the initiators proclaimed, \\"With this transparent, life-giving, powerful, God- given fluid, more precious and far more significant than all the sacred oils of the ancients, I set you apparent from the men of your daily association in the great and honorable task you have voluntarily allotted yourselves as citizens of the Invisible Empire, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.\\" The article also gives excerpts from dedication rituals involved in the initiation process. September 13, 1921 The eighth article was titled \\"Klan's Dire Crusade to Mean Fireworks, Klux Emperor Hints\\" ‚Äì \\"Invisible Terror's Campaign Against Enemies Will Come When Time is Ripe, Wizard Declares.\\" The article describes how according to Joseph Simmons, the Klan at the time was still in an organizing mode, waiting until it had gained enough membership before it participated in \\"fireworks\\". The author gives examples of quotes downplaying the Klan as a fraternal order, committed to 100% Americanism, using vague statements. September 14, 1921 The ninth article was titled \\"Bogus K.C. Oath Used by Klux Klan Kleagle 'Among Certain Few'\\" ‚Äì \\"Exposure of Fraud Follows Publication of Letters Written by Klux Official ‚Äì Falsity of Claim Proved by Masonic Investigators.\\" The article focuses on pamphlet literature handed out by Kleagles to try to convince new members to join. One pamphlet included an example of a Knights of Columbus oath that was forged by the Klan. The oath includes anti-Protestant sentiments including, \\"when opportunity presents, make and wage relentless war, openly and secretly, against all heretics, Protestants and Masons‚Ä¶\\" (sept 14th pg. 4). The oath was presented as an oath taken to become a 4th degree Knight of Columbus as an example to pitch the idea that Catholics were looking to eradicate Protestants and therefore should join the Klan. September 15, 1921 The tenth article was titled \\"Bitter Anti-Catholic Propaganda Peddled by Officials of Klan\\" ‚Äì \\"Methods More Secretive than Formerly Used by A.P.A., Is Claim ‚Äì Publication Supposed to be Allied to Order, Attacks Roman Catholic.\\" The article focuses on more anti-Catholic propaganda by the Klan. The article mentions a card distributed by the Klan called \\"Do You Know?\\" that gave false information about the activities of the Catholic Church. These included statements about the Pope controlling the media, court systems, denouncing popular government, and installing his own Catholic government. September 16, 1921 The eleventh article was titled \\"Ku Klux Made Jews and Negroes Target For Racial Hatreds\\" ‚Äì \\"Not all of 'Colonel' Simmons' Warfare was Directed Against Americans Who are Catholics for He Sought 'White Supremacy'.\\" September 17, 1921 The twelfth article was titled \\"Ku Klux Klan Oath So Stiff, Startles 'Hardened Joiners'\\" ‚Äì \\"One Section Endorses Principle of Secret Mob Rule, Another Requires Implicit Obedience to Unknown Constitution and Regulations and Obligation is Sealed in Open Lodge with Blood of Candidate.\\" September 18, 1921 The thirteenth article was titled \\"Texas Newspapers Get Klan Command to Publish Letter\\" ‚Äì \\"Lawless Ku Klux Spirit Evident in Outrages Credited to Organization ‚Äì Supra-Legal Powers are Arrogated as Law is Ignored and Administration of Justice is Assumed by Men Who Hide Faces Behind Masks.\\" September 19, 1921 The fourteenth article was titled \\"Wholesale Outrages Attributed to Texas and Klux Klans\\" ‚Äì \\"Members of Institution, Who Substitute Terrorism for Law, Kidnap, Beat, Tar and Feather Victims, Then Turn Them Loose on Other Communities ‚Äì Long List of Attacks in Lone Star State.\\" September 20, 1921 The fifteenth article was titled \\"Ku Klux Klan Spirit Revived by Simmons is Law Unto Itself\\" ‚Äì \\"Congress Was Forced to Stop Original Order Because of Outrages it Practiced After Men Who Formed it For Lawful Purposes Had Lost Control ‚Äì What Charter Members and Noted Texan Say of Society.\\" September 21, 1921 The sixteenth article was titled \\"Federal, State, City Officials Are Giving Protection to Klan\\" ‚Äì \\"Imperial Wizard Boasts Congressman Belong to Organization and Official Publication Shows Prosecuting Attorneys , Judges, Police Chiefs and Other Peace Officers are Members of Secret Order.\\" September 22, 1921 The seventeenth article was titled \\"Masonry Race Riots and Film Propaganda Used by Ku Klux Klan\\" ‚Äì \\"Adroit Sales Wrinkles, Catch- Penny Mysteries, Snake Oil Advertisements Adopted by Officials to Increase Membership and Further Schemes of Organization ‚Äì Publicity Eagerly Sought Despite Claims of Secrecy.\\" September 23, 1921 The eighteenth article was titled \\"Knights of Air Fail to Induce Pershing to Become Member\\" ‚Äì \\"General Menoher 'Called' Klan for Unauthorized Use of Name ‚Äì Postcard Sent to Army Men Seeking Joiners, World Charges Simmons Offered Advertising for Agreement to Shield Order's Secrets.\\" September 24, 1921 The nineteenth article was titled \\"Talking in Millions.

Early life and education General Mohammed Asif Safi Khan was born in Laghman Province in eastern Afghanistan. His father, Mohammed Ayub Khan (also known as Malik Saylob), was a local Malik of Ali Khel district . At age four, Asif Khan attended Afghanistan's National Army school (Pashto: Arbi Shwanzai) . In 1944, he graduated from Afghanistan's National Army University (Pashto: Arbi Pohantoon) with highest honor. In 1945, he went to India for higher education, and attended an Army Institute in the city of Ambala . In 1955, he went to Turkey where he obtained a master's degree, and went again in 1959 to obtain a doctorate degree . He attended the Turkish War College of Command (Turkish: Harp Akademileri Komutanlƒ±ƒüƒ±), the same Army Institute as attended by Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk. Career Asif Khan did not affiliate with any political movement or party in Afghanistan . In 1962, Asif Khan was appointed as Commander for Officer's University of Heytyaat . In 1967, he was appoint as Commander and Professor at Officer's Higher University (Dari] ]: Course of Haa, Haa being short for Haali = Higher), which he also founded . During this time hundreds of Army Officers were trained under him, and he established himself a unique position in Afghan Army, considered one of the most educated and influential of the army officers . Based on his qualification and the respect that he earned in Army, Asif Khan was promoted to the first rank of army General (Pashto: ÿ®ÿ±Ÿäÿ™ ÿ¨ŸÜÿ±ÿßŸÑ Breet General) in 1970 . In 1973, General Safi was appointed as the Commander of Air Defense at Qala- i-Jangi of Kabul Province . In 1974, he was appointed as the Director of Army's Ministry of Education (Pashto: Taleem-O-Tarbia) . In 1975, he was appointed as the Commander of Army's 12th Infantry in Gardƒìz (Dari: ⁄Øÿ±ÿØ€åÿ≤, Pashto: ⁄´ÿ±ÿØ€êÿ≤), the capital of PaktiƒÅ province of Afghanistan . In 1976, he was appointed as the Commander of Army's 20th Infantry in Nahrin, a town in Baghlan Province of north-eastern Afghanistan . Also during this year he was promoted to the rank of the second rank of army General (Pashto; ÿ™Ÿàÿ±ÿßŸÜ ÿ¨ŸÜÿ±ÿßŸÑ Tooran General) . Establishment of First Army Officer‚Äôs Academy General Safi receiving a medal of honor from Sardar Shah Wali Khan and then Prime Minister Daoud Khan in the background. One of General Safi's greatest achievement and service to Afghan National Army was the establishment of the first Officer's Academy in the history of Afghanistan known as Course-e-Haa (short for Course e Haali Afsaran meaning Academy of Higher Education for Officers) . Before this course, Afghanistan's army only had Harbi Shwanzai (Army School of 1 through 12K), and Harbi Pohantun (Army University which offered 4-year program), which meant that Master Degree program were not offered for army officers . Most army officer, including Safi himself, would travel to India, United States, Turkey, and Russia, to obtain higher army education . Safi was the first army officer to obtain a Doctorate Degree from Turkey , and therefore, had academic credentials to issue a Master Degree for army officers . Given his experience of commanding and teaching at Officer's University of Heytyaat (Army Reserve University), Army University (Harbi Pohantun), and Army High School (Harbi Shwanzai), Safi, in 1967, established the Course-e-Haa (Officer's Academy for Higher Education) . The Diploma offered by Course-e-Haa was equivalent to that of a Master Degree. Hence, for the first time in the history of Afghanistan's armed forces, since its modern era establishment by Amir Shir Ali Khan during the 1860s, Afghanistan's army officer could obtain higher education in Afghanistan instead of travelling to other countries . Hundreds of Afghan army officers, including many prominent figures, attended and graduated from Course-e-Haa . During his time as general, he had received medals from Marshal Sardar Shah Wali Khan Ghazi, King Zahir Shah, and President Daoud Khan . General Safi had traveled numerous times on behalf of Defense Ministry to other countries for weapon purchases and signing defense contracts . He accompanied King Zahir Shah on an official state visit to the Soviet Union in 1967 . General Safi was the Security in Charge (Pashto: Yaawar) to many foreign dignitary and heads of state visiting Afghanistan, including Iran‚Äôs Prime Minister Amir-Abbas Hoveida‚Äôs official visit to Afghanistan . Safi's biography in honor of his service to Afghanistan has been written in the Defense Ministry . His work as founder and leading instructor of Course-e-Haa, Air Defense, and for translating numerous military books and articles from Turkish to Pashto and Dari was recognized even during the communist regime of Afghanistan . Political turmoil of Afghanistan General Safi was forced out of Army since he did not assist Mohammed Daoud Khan during his successful coup d'etat in 1973 against king Mohammed Zahir Shah . Eventually President Daoud Khan met with Safi and acknowledged his service for Afghanistan rather than the disposed monarchy, and reappointing him . In 1973, shortly after Daoud Khan's rise to Presidency, a coup attempt, which may have been planned before Daoud Khan took power, was subdued shortly after his Presidency . Former Prime Minister Mohammad Hashim Maiwandwal (Pashto: ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ Ÿáÿßÿ¥ŸÖ ŸÖ€åŸàŸÜÿØŸàÿßŸÑ) was arrested in this plot . Whether Maiwandwal was in on the plot from the start is open to question. This led to the arrest of Maiwandwal and 20 others, including General Safi, who was jailed for two weeks before released . President Daoud Khan personally apologized to Safi for the arrest and for forcing him out of the Army . Safi cautioned and advised Daoud Khan during this meeting of the threat of the rising communist movement, and specifically named Babrak Karmal as one of the members of this movement . Maiwandwal was supposedly killed by the Parcham (Pashto: Ÿæÿ±⁄ÜŸÖ meaning \\"Banner\\" or \\"Flag\\") wing of the communist party (who controlled Interior Ministry) during his custody . General Safi was in Nahrin when he heard news of the Saur Revolution in 1978, unable to bring his infantry to Kabul to assist President Daoud Khan. After his return to Kabul, Safi was put under house arrest by the new communist regime for a short period of time, and later on forced to an honorable retirement. Post-service life During the communist regime, General Safi was put under house arrest twice during President Nur Muhammad Taraki and then Hafizullah Amin. He was not harmed because he was not associated with any political movement. Following the outbreak of the Soviet- Afghan War, General Safi developed medical depression. He was invited to many government sponsored events but Safi refused to attend, except those related to Afghanistan's military history and culture . In 1986, when Dr. Mohammad Najibullah became president, some freedom of movement and expression was restored in Afghanistan. However, security was constantly destabilizing during this time. Safi in January 2007. General Safi did attend a Loya Jirga under President Najibullah . The Defense Ministry eventually honored Safi's service by putting his name and biography officially as the leading instructor of Course-e-Haa and Air Defense . Also during this period Safi was given a diplomatic passport and all his travel restrictions were removed. Safi left for India in 1989 before settling in United States in 1997. General Safi died of natural causes on July 26, 2009. Safi's grave site is located in Sacramento Muslim Cemeteryhttp://sacramentomuslimcemetery.com/ in northern California. He left behind his second wife and twelve children.

Education  Iansiti graduated summa cum laude from Harvard University in 1983, with an A.B. in Physics.Curriculum Vitae of Professor Marco Iansiti, U.S. Department of Justice He subsequently went on to perform his Ph.D. in Physics at Harvard University Iansiti's Ph.D. thesis focused on experimental low temperature electronics and semiconductor microfabrication techniques.See, for example, Marco Iansiti et al., \\"Charging Energy and Phase Delocalization in Single Very Small Josephson Tunnel- Junctions,\\" Physical Review Letters, Volume 60, Issue 23, Pgs. 2414-2417, June 6, 1988. He won the Robbins Physics Prize in 1986, and was awarded his Ph.D. in September 1988. He was awarded an IBM post-doctoral fellowship for 1988‚Äì1989, and performed research on the design and fabrication of next- generation microelectronic devices at Harvard University.See, for example, Marco Iansiti et al., \\"Quantum Tunneling and Low-Voltage Resistance in Small Superconducting Tunnel-Junctions,\\" Physical Review B, Volume 40, Issue 16, Pages 11,370-11,373, December 1, 1989.  Career  Iansiti's academic research at the Harvard Business School has focused on technological innovation, product development, entrepreneurship, and operations-specifically the drivers of productivity, flexibility, and adaptation in organizations.See, for example, Marco Iansiti and Jonathan West, \\"Technology Integration: Turning Great Research into Great Products,\\" Harvard Business Review, Volume 75, Issue 5, September‚ÄìOctober 1997 or Marco Iansiti, \\"How the Incumbent can Win: Managing Technological Transitions in the Semiconductor Industry,\\" Management Science, Volume 47, Issue 1, Pgs. 133-150, January 2001. He is the author or coauthor of more than 50 articles, papers, book chapters, cases, and notes. Iansiti has also taught a variety of Executive Education and MBA courses on innovation, entrepreneurship, and operations, and is the creator of two Harvard Business School courses: \\"Managing Product Development\\" and \\"Starting New Ventures\\" (with Harvard Business School Professor Myra Hart). Iansiti has performed consultant and advisory roles focusing on strategy and innovation for a variety of Fortune 500 companies. He has also testified as an expert witness before the European Commission and United States Department of Justice regarding antitrust and intellectual property issues in the high-tech industry.See, for example, Marco Iansiti and Greg Richards, \\"Six Years Later: The Impact of the Evolution of the IT Ecosystem,\\" Antitrust Law Journal, Volume 75, Issue 3, Pgs. 705-721, 2009.  Development of the field of Ecosystem Strategy  Iansiti helped develop the field of Ecosystem Strategy, which focuses on the creation of firm-level strategies that are intimately connected to the surrounding business ecosystem.See, for example, Marco Iansiti, \\"Keystones and Dominators: Framing Operating and Technology Strategy in a Business Ecosystem\\" Iansiti built upon the previous work of James F. Moore,James F. Moore, \\"Predators and Prey: A New Ecology of Competition,\\" Harvard Business Review, May/June, 1993 the founder of the field of Ecosystem Strategy, and is considered the current thought leader in the field. Iansiti examined firms such as Microsoft Corporation and Walmart, and found that the success of these firms depended heavily on the sustained health of complex networks of customers, suppliers, and competitors: > Many industries today behave like a massively interconnected network of > organizations, technologies, consumers and products. Perhaps the most > dramatic and widely known example is the computing industry. In contrast > with the vertically integrated environment of the 1960s and 1970s, today's > industry is divided into a large number of segments producing specialized > products, technologies and services. The degree of interaction between firms > in the industry is truly astounding, with hundreds of organizations > frequently involved in the design, production, distribution, or > implementation of even a single product. And because of this increasingly > distributed industry structure, the focus of competition is shifting away > from the management of internal resources, to the management and influence > of assets that are outside the direct ownership and control of the > firm.Marco Iansiti, \\"Keystones and Dominators: Framing Operating and > Technology Strategy in a Business Ecosystem\\" , pg. 1 Iansiti went on to define the roles required for a business ecosystem to be considered healthy, including Keystones that provide a foundation for connecting and supporting other organizations within the ecosystem. This field of strategy provides insights for industries in which interdependencies and engagement with customers and suppliers are critical.  Contribution to Understanding the role of Information Technology in Modern Businesses  Iansiti has made a significant contribution to the field of Information Technology (IT) strategy, developing a framework for the assessment of capabilities created through firm-level investment in IT.See, for example, Marco Iansiti, \\"Why IT Matters in Midsized Firms\\" Iansiti's work in this area built upon research by others that had explored the link between IT investment and enterprise growth,See, for example, Kevin Crowston and Michael Treacy, \\"Assessing the Impact of Information Technology on Enterprise Level Performance,\\" Working Paper, Sloan School of Management, 1986. breaking enterprise growth into the capabilities IT enables and examining the impact of these individual capabilities on enterprise performance. This more nuanced approach led to a framework for assessing an organizations' level of IT maturity, referred to as the IT Scorecard. This scorecard allowed the return on an organization's IT investment to be measured more accurately than had been possible previously, and provided a more action-oriented assessment that could be used, for example, to focus improvement efforts on under-developed IT capabilities. In early 2017, Iansiti teamed up with Prof. Karim Lakhani on a Harvard Business Review article where they said blockchain is not a disruptive technology that undercuts the cost of an existing business model, but is a foundational technology that \\"has the potential to create new foundations for our economic and social systems\\". They further predicted that, while foundational innovations can have enormous impact, \\"It will take decades for blockchain to seep into our economic and social infrastructure.\\"  Contribution to Understanding the Digital Transformation of Business  Iansiti more recently made a contribution to the field of technology strategy to understand the phenomenon of digital transformation.See, for example, Marco Iansiti, \\"Digital Ubiquity: How Connections, Sensors, and Data are Revolutionizing BUsiness\\" Iansiti's work in this area is in collaboration with Prof. Karim Lakhani, also of the Harvard Business School. It explores the evolution of models for value creation and capture as businesses increase in digital content. Examples range from General Electric to Google.  Key publications  Books ‚Ä¢ One Strategy: Organization, Planning, and Decision Making (Wiley, 2009). Iansiti writes with Steven Sinofsky of Microsoft Corporation on the gap that often develops between top-down, directed strategy and bottom-up, emergent behavior within an organization. Iansiti and Sinofsky discuss the approach Sinofsky took within the Windows and Windows Live Group at Microsoft to bridge this gap during the development of the Windows 7 operating system. ‚Ä¢ The Keystone Advantage: What the New Dynamics of Business Ecosystems Mean for Strategy, Innovation, and Sustainability (Harvard Business School Press, 2004) Iansiti writes with Roy Levien about the concept of the business ecosystem, whereby complex business networks can be thought of as interdependent ecosystems.Iansiti explains the concept of business ecosystems in Marco Iansiti and Roy Levin, \\"Strategy as Ecology,\\" Harvard Business Review, Volume 82, Issue 3, March, 2004. Within this context, Iansiti discusses the role of Keystones, firms that create a platform that sustains and enhances the health and performance of the business ecosystem. ‚Ä¢ Technology Integration: Making Critical Choices in a Turbulent World (Harvard Business School Press, 1997) Iansiti writes about the choices faced by high- tech firms regarding the adoption and integration of new technologies into the firm's offerings. Iansiti assesses the performance of technology integration projects and makes suggestions for organizational best practices.

The statue is dated to between 500 and 700 AD (but see below). It is 2.3 m high and 1 m wide and weighs over 500 kg. It was found in the North Indian town of Sultanganj, Bhagalpur district, Bihar in 1861 during the construction of the East Indian Railway. It is now in the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, Birmingham, England. Over life-size, this is \\"the only remaining metal statue of any size\\" from Gupta art, out of what was at the time probably approximately as numerous a type as stone or stucco statues.Rowland, 237 The metal Brahma from Mirpur-Khas is older, but about half the size. The Jain Akota bronzes and some other finds are much smaller still, probably figures for shrines in well-off homes.Rowland, 237-239 The style of the Sultanganj figure is comparable to slightly earlier stone Buddha figures from Sarnath in \\"the smoothly rounded attenuation of body and limbs\\" and the very thin, clinging body garment, indicated in the lightest of ways. The figure has \\"a feeling of animation imparted by the unbalanced stance and the movement suggested by the sweeping silhouette of the enveloping robe\\". Description The Sultanganj Buddha was cast in pure, unrefined copper by the cire perdue, or lost wax, technique. Inside there is a clay body, mixed with rice husks that allowed radiocarbon dating.Harle, 212 The figure stands in the \\"Fearless Posture\\", with his right hand raised in abhayamudra (a gesture of reassurance or protection), and his left hand is held downwards with palm outwards, said to indicate granting a favour. The end of the monastic robe is held between the thumb and forefinger of this hand in the manner that is still practised by Theravadin monks. Date The sculpture was originally dated to the Gupta period, Vincent Arthur Smith specifying around 400 in a book of 1911. Then dates as late as 800 came to be preferred. The results of the radiocarbon dating suggest 600-650, though the museum still prefers \\"500-700\\". Discovery and later history EB Harris with the Sultanganj Buddha. 1861/1862 Stone statue of Buddha from Sultanganj in the British Museum. Ye Dharma Hetu inscribed on the lotus base (magnify to see). E. B. Harris, the railway engineer who discovered the Buddha during excavations that he carried out on ancient remains near the Sultanganj station that he was constructing, published a detailed account of his work, complete with a site plan and photographs. He describes finding the right foot of the Buddha ten feet under the surface, beneath a floor he considered to have been used to conceal the statue after it had been toppled from its former place.Harris, E. B. (1864) Description of Buddhist Remains Discovered at Sooltangunge, London: privately published. Harris sent the statue to Birmingham, the cost of its transport to England being paid by Samuel Thornton, a Birmingham manufacturer of ironmongery. Thornton, himself a former mayor of Birmingham, offered it to the Borough Council for their proposed Art Museum in 1864. In Birmingham, a town that boasted a thousand trades, the Art Museum was intended to be an exemplar and inspiration for local metalworkers and other artisans. Over the years, it has been shown in a number of prominent locations throughout Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery (BMAG) and remains an indispensable display item. It was the foundation donation to the collections and is BMAG's most treasured possession. Harris's report shows him with the Buddha and a number of smaller finds. They included two much smaller standing Buddhas in stone: one is now in the British Museum and the other in the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco. A stone Buddha head, also from Sultanganj, is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Current location From 1998 to 2015, the Buddha was the centrepiece of a gallery at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery dedicated to displaying a number of Buddhas and related artefacts, and Birmingham Museum held an annual 'Buddha Day', when West Midlands-based Buddhist groups from a range of traditions would bless the statue. During 2015, Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery worked with representatives of a number of faith groups from the city on the creation of a new 'Faith Gallery', and the Sultanganj Buddha was moved from its previous location. It is now displayed in a new gallery that tells the story of the range of faiths that are practiced in Birmingham.

Born in Athlone, he started his career in his homeland before moving to England and playing for seven different Football League clubs. At the end of his career, he also played for two non-league teams. While playing for Nelson, he scored the club's first ever goal in the Football League, in a 1‚Äì2 loss to Wigan Borough on 27 August 1921. Halligan won two caps for the Ireland national team and scored one goal for his country, in a 1‚Äì2 defeat by Wales on 28 January 1911. His second appearance for Ireland came on 10 February 1912, in the 1‚Äì6 loss to England. Club career Halligan's senior career started in his native Ireland, with Cliftonville, and he later moved on to Belfast Celtic. In 1908, he joined Distillery, where he played for one season. While playing for Distillery, he was selected to play in an Irish League XI against a Scottish League XI. It was in this match that he was watched by Leeds City, and his performance convinced the club to sign him at the beginning of the 1909‚Äì10 season. Halligan scored two goals on his debut for Leeds City in a 5‚Äì0 victory against Lincoln City on 1 September 1909. He went on to score a total of 12 goals in the season, helping the side avoid relegation from the Football League Second Division. His goals for Leeds City saw him signed for a fee of ¬£400 by Derby County in February 1910. He played 22 games for the Rams, scoring eight goals for the club, before moving to Wolverhampton Wanderers in June 1911 for a fee of ¬£450. In his first season with the club, he played 35 matches and scored 19 goals as the side finished fifth in the Second Division. The following campaign, Halligan achieved a tally of 15 league goals in 32 appearances. Prior to the start of the 1913‚Äì14 season, Wolverhampton accepted a bid of ¬£600 from fellow Second Division outfit Hull City and he joined them in May 1913. In the following two seasons, Halligan scored 28 league goals in 65 games. He also played seven FA Cup matches for the side, but failed to score in any of them. As a result of the First World War, competitive football was suspended in England after the 1914‚Äì15 season. Halligan played for a number of teams as a guest during the war, including Manchester United, Chesterfield and Stockport County, and by the end of the war, he was playing for Lancashire side Rochdale. When league play restarted at the start of the 1919‚Äì20 season, Halligan joined Preston North End. He scored two goals in 16 matches for the side before signing for Oldham Athletic on a free transfer in January 1920. In the remainder of the season, he managed six goals in 18 league games. The following campaign, he only made ten league appearances, scoring three goals as the side finished 19th in the Football League First Division. In August 1922, Halligan was signed for a fee of ¬£75 by Nelson for the club's first season in the Football League Third Division North. On his debut for Nelson, he scored the club's first ever Football League goal, in the 1‚Äì2 defeat by Wigan Borough on 27 August 1921. His spell with the Blues ended in June 1922, after a total of six goals in 17 appearances for the side. Upon leaving Nelson, he joined Midland League outfit Boston Town. He left to join Wisbech Town in 1924, and played there for one season before retiring at the end of the 1924‚Äì25 season, aged 39. International career Halligan won two caps for the Ireland national football team. His first cap for his country came on 28 January 1911. He scored on his international debut, in the 1‚Äì2 loss to Wales. His second game for Ireland came over a year later, when he was selected to play in the 1‚Äì6 defeat by England on 10 February 1912. Following the First World War, Halligan was chosen by his country to play in two Victory international matches. The first match ended in a 1‚Äì2 defeat away to Scotland on 22 March 1919. Just under one month later, on 19 April 1919, he played in the return game at home to Scotland, which finished as a 0‚Äì0 draw.

Early life Born in Saltash in Cornwall as Ann Warren or Warring, she married John Glanville, a waterman from a line of watermen. They had fourteen children and when John fell ill, Ann continued her husband's trade to support the family. Rowing success Ann formed a crew of four female rowers who took part in local regattas; she was noted for her large stature and for her crew who dressed in white caps and dresses. Their success led to competitions all over the country; one event at Fleetwood was watched by Queen Victoria, who congratulated Ann when they won by beating an all-male crew. The most famous competition was said to have been in 1833 when they visited Le Havre and beat the best ten French male crews by 100 yards; this led the press to call her the champion female rower of the world. However, recent research by A T Goodman for the Old Cornwall Society has thrown doubt on this version of events. The visit to Le Havre was actually in August 1842 aboard the paddle steamer Grand Turk; the French refused to put up a team to row against women and so a demonstration race was conducted between Ann Glanville's female crew and male rowers from the Grand Turk, which was won by the women. Old age Blue plaque for Ann Glanville Ann continued competitive rowing until she was in her sixties. Into her old age, she was given to circling the warships anchored in the Hamoaze exchanging banter with their crews. When the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Edinburgh visited Plymouth in 1879, they invited Ann to lunch on their yacht. She died on 6 June 1880 and was buried in St Stephen's Churchyard at the expense of Admiral Lord Beresford. Admirers from all parts of the country attended and a Royal Marines band played the funeral march. Remembrance Pilot Gig Championships 2018, at St Mary's Harbour in the Isles of Scilly. The Caradon Gig Rowing Club named their first pilot gig after Ann. In September 2013, a fibre glass statue of Ann sitting on a bench was unveiled in Fore Street, the main shopping street of Saltash. The life-sized figure has a sound recording of the key events of Ann's life, which can be activated by pushing a button. In 2018, the statue was moved to its new location of Saltash Waterside.

It is named after the phrase uttered by Admiral Ackbar in the Star Wars film Return of the Jedi.https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo- way/2016/04/05/473073158/star-wars-voice-actor-who-as-admiral-ackbar-warned- its-a-trap-dies-at-93 The home video was first released on December 21, 2010 and later aired on Fox in the United States on May 22, 2011. The episode was written by Cherry Chevapravatdumrong and David A. Goodman and directed by Peter Shin. It retells the story of Return of the Jedi as \\"Blue Harvest\\" did with Star Wars and \\"Something, Something, Something, Dark Side\\" did with The Empire Strikes Back by recasting characters from Family Guy into roles from the film. Plot The Griffin family experience another power outage, forcing them to reluctantly go through Return of the Jedi. Rather than setting up the plot, the opening crawl states that Fox required Seth MacFarlane to complete the trilogy to be allowed to direct Ted. On Tatooine, R2-D2 and C-3PO find Jabba the Hutt's palace in order to initiate a plan to save Han Solo, still frozen in carbonite for posterity. Leia unfreezes Han but Jabba captures her and she is shackled by Jabba's side. Han, meanwhile, is thrown into a prison cell with Chewbacca. Luke arrives at the palace and attempts to bargain for the release of his friends. Jabba opens a trap door and Luke falls into a pit where he battles and kills the Rancor. Afterwards, Jabba orders Luke and his friends to be eaten by the Sarlacc. Luke initiates an assault on Jabba's crew with the help of Lando Calrissian, disguised as one of Jabba's henchmen. Distracted by the carnage, Leia chokes Jabba using her slave chains while her fellow rebels commandeer a transport ship and fly to safety. Luke and R2-D2 fly to Dagobah so Luke can finish his training with Yoda while the others rejoin the rebel fleet. On Dagobah, Yoda explains the final part of training is to face Vader. In his dying words, Yoda reveals that Luke has a sibling. The spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi appears to Luke and further explains that his sibling is Princess Leia; he chastises Luke for not figuring it out sooner, as Leia is \\"the only goddamn woman in the galaxy\\". The rebels begin planning an assault on the new Death Star and Admiral Ackbar explains that they must first destroy a shield generator located on the forest moon of Endor. In order to land on the forest moon of Endor, Han uses a stolen Imperial ship and old access code to sneak past the Empire's blockade. Vader allows them passage on to the moon, knowing Luke is aboard the ship. When they reach the moon's surface, the rebels are spotted by Imperial soldiers which they stop from reporting after a high-speed chase. Separated from the others, Leia is befriended by Wicket the Ewok. Luke, Han, Chewie and the droids fall into an Ewok trap while searching for Leia. They are captured and brought to the village where Leia is being housed. The Ewoks believe C-3PO is a god and begin to worship him. Luke tells Princess Leia they are siblings, but Leia claims to have already known that, even when they kissed: \\"I'm from Alderaan. It's basically the Mississippi of the galaxy.\\" Following Yoda's advice, Luke surrenders to Vader in order to confront him. Vader tries to convince Luke to turn to the dark side. Luke refuses and the two meet with the Emperor, who reveals that Luke's friends are walking into a trap on the forest moon. When this revelation fails to anger Luke, the Emperor begins to mock actor Seth Green (who voices Chris). Luke defends Green saying that he's been in successful projects, only to have The Emperor saying the negative side of Green's roles. Luke becomes enraged and begins dueling Vader. Back on the forest moon, Han leads the rebels to the shield generator, however, the company is ambushed. The Ewoks help the rebels escape from the Imperial troops and destroy the shield generator, while Lando and Nien Nunb lead the attack on the Death Star. Luke finally subdues Vader, but he refuses to execute him and join the dark side at the Emperor's request. The Emperor then incapacitates Luke with his powerful Force lightning. Because Luke asks Vader politely for help, Vader gathers his remaining strength and kills the distracted Emperor by throwing him into the reactor core. Vader and Luke manage to flee the Death Star before Lando and his crew blow it up. Unfortunately, when Vader asks Luke to help him remove his mask (to \\"look on you with my own eyes\\"), Luke accidentally twists and breaks Vader's neck. Everyone rendezvous back at the Ewok village to celebrate the rebels victory over the Empire. While the Ewoks kill the wounded Imperials, the spirits of Obi-Wan and Yoda appear to Luke, alongside the spirit of the redeemed Anakin Skywalker, who angrily accuses Luke of murdering him. The Griffins' power returns just as Peter concludes the story, Meg then asks Peter \\"What about the prequel trilogy?\\" with Peter suggesting that The Cleveland Show might do the prequels. After that, the family starts arguing about whether Seth Green or Seth MacFarlane is a better artist.

The second working title, We Have a Bad Feeling About This, was a reference to the recurring catchphrase that is used in the Star Wars films. The settled-upon title is a reference to the line by Admiral Ackbar in the film, which became an Internet meme through YTMND. Due to the declining number of unused Family Guy characters, the episode also features characters from American Dad! and The Cleveland Show: Roger appears as Moff Jerjerrod, (with Vader/Stewie commenting \\"What, have we run out of our characters already?\\") Klaus appears as Admiral Ackbar, Tim appears as Wicket the Ewok and Rallo appears as Nien Nunb. Stan was originally going to appear as Wedge Antilles, but his part got cut (he is still mentioned when Lando orders him to destroy the Power Station in the main reactor of the Death Star).

Influenced by Ralph Stanley and his Clinch Mountain Boys, Johnson is often considered to be an inventor of the newgrass style of banjo playing, polished and improved later on by such personalities as B√©la Fleck, Alison Brown, Scott Vestal of Sam Bush Band and Jens Kr√ºger of Kruger Brothers.Bio on www.answers.com Early life Johnson began to play guitar at the age of seven, but didn't pick up the banjo until he was about 25 years old. He worked as a mechanic in a service station at his hometown of Hiseville, Kentucky before he earned enough money as a musician. Johnson played in several local bands, including the Rocky Road Boys with Bill Hatfield on fiddle and Bill Logsdon on guitar.Info on www.bgdailynews.com Bluegrass Alliance In 1969, Sam Bush asked Courtney to join his band, Poor Richard's Almanac. They played together in local clubs until 1970, when Bush left to join the Bluegrass Alliance band. In 1971, Johnson also joined the band, consisting of Bush, fiddler Lonnie Pierce, guitarist Tony Rice and bassist Ebo Walker. The Bluegrass Alliance is often considered as one of the bands that started to play progressive bluegrass. Band frontman Lonnie Peerce suffered with health problems and the band went on hiatus several times. Other members of the group were busy with other projects and all that led, consequently, to disbanding of the group and creation of the New Grass Revival The Bluegrass Alliance eventually reformed in 1998 with all new members.Bluegrass Alliance info on www.rambles.net New Grass Revival New Grass Revival was formed by Bush, Johnson, Walker and Curtis Burch in 1971, after they left Lonnie Pierce and decided to create their own band. The group name comes from the style they created, \\"Newgrass\\", a term that Sam Bush credited to Ebo Walker. This line-up recorded the band's self-titled album in 1972. After some early changes on the bass position, the group recruited rock bassist John Cowan and recorded 5 albums in this setup. Most of the band members were multi-instrumentalists and Johnson often switched from banjo and guitar, sometimes even during one song on stage. He occasionally played Dobro as well and occasionally sang harmony. During his years with New Grass Revival, he developed the banjo playing to new levels. He is considered as a very innovative banjo player, although not as polished as later group member B√©la Fleck. His trademark banjo solos with the band include songs such as \\"When the Storm Is Over\\", \\"Steam Powered Aeroplane\\", \\"Fly through the Country\\", \\"This Heart of Mine\\", \\"Crooked Smile\\", \\"Souvenir Bottles\\", \\"Great Balls of Fire\\" and others. Later career In 1981, Johnson and Burch left the New Grass Revival, citing that they were tired of touring. They continued playing locally in several bands including the Courtney Johnson Band, Barren County and BJT (Burch, Johson, Timberlake). Johnson later put together a band including Burch on Dobro/guitar, himself on banjo/guitar, his wife Hazel on mandolin/guitar and Eric Albany on bass.I www.bgdailynews.com www.bgdailynews.com Johnson died on June 7, 1996, aged 56, diagnosed with lung cancer.www2.nau.edu On September 24 of that year, a benefit concert at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee was organized by his friend Sam Bush.

Houben was presumed comatose and in a vegetative state for 23 years after a near-fatal automobile accident, but whom according to several of his caregivers, was conscious and paralyzed during the entirety of his hospital stay.Raf Casert (23 November 2009). \\"Rom Houben, man in coma for 23 years, was fully conscious, mom says\\". The Huffington Post. In 2010, the claim was rejected when communication could not be repeated with a different facilitator and by hiding the object to be identified from the view of the facilitator. Background Houben was diagnosed with total locked-in syndrome by Belgian neurologist Steven Laureys in 2006 with the help of modern brain imaging techniques and equipment.Kate Connolly (23 November 2009). \\"Car crash victim trapped in 'coma' for 23 years was conscious\\". guardian.co.uk. He now apparently communicates by typing into a keyboard with his right hand supported by a communication facilitator.Mark Memmott (23 November 2009). \\"For 23 years man thought to be in coma tried to 'scream', and no one heard\\". National Public Radio. However, the claims that Houben is able to communicate by typing have been widely disputed. Houben's case is used to question the current methods of diagnosing vegetative state and to arguments against withholding care from such patients. However, some bioethicists believe that the case, if confirmed, may provide stronger arguments for withdrawing or withholding from vegetative patients. While Houben was diagnosed in 2006, his case, first reported in a BMC Neurology paper in July 2009 without him being named, was only brought to wider public attention after German weekly magazine Der Spiegel ran a story on it in November 2009 which was subsequently picked up by media outlets around the world, receiving extensive coverage.Manfred Dworschak (23 November 2009). \\"‚ÄûMeine zweite Geburt\\"\\". Der Spiegel 48/2009, pp. 134-137. Controversy Bioethicist Jacob M. Appel of New York University has suggested that the case may be either \\"a matter of wishful thinking\\", or \\"a cruel and manipulative hoax\\" that will be used by political conservatives in their public relations campaign against the right to die.Jacob M. Appel (24 November 2009). The Rom Houben Tragedy and the Case for Active Euthanasia. The Huffington Post. Retrieved on 29 November 2009. The method used to allegedly communicate with Houben is known as \\"facilitated communication\\", which the Association for Behavior Analysis International, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and the American Association on Mental Retardation have called a \\"discredited technique\\", the use of which is \\"unwarranted and unethical\\".Arthur Caplan (24 November 2009). Coherent after coma? Not so sure. NBC News. Retrieved on 29 November 2009.

Man in Coma 23 Years ‚Äì Is He Really Conscious?. Retrieved on 29 November 2009. Additionally, Arthur Caplan, a bioethics professor at the University of Pennsylvania, has claimed that the statements Houben allegedly made through his facilitator seem unnatural for someone disabled and unable to speak for decades. Through Wouters, Houben is quoted as saying \\"Now I can communicate and talk via facilitated communication. Not everyone believes in this form of communication. It is a controversial method but, for me, it is vital to life. At last, my views can be heard and my feelings expressed.\\"David Charter (25 November 2009). \\"Mystery as coma survivor Rom Houben finds voice at his fingertips\\". Times Online. Initially, Laureys said that he had verified that the facilitated communication was genuine, by showing Houben objects when the facilitator was not present in the room, and later asking Houben to recall those objects. Novella suggested that Laureys had not used proper controls. In an interview with the Belgian newspaper De Standaard, Laureys stated that he was not involved in the choice of communication method and refused to comment on its validity. He even claimed to be \\"a skeptic [himself]\\" and acknowledged that \\"the bad reputation of some forms [of facilitated communication] is justified\\". He also claimed that Houben's case was only made public because Der Spiegel wanted to report on his study and was looking for a \\"human element\\" to the story: \\"I knew that Rom and his family were willing to collaborate because they had done so before [for a Flemish TV channel].\\" However, he also criticized some of the negative feedback for \\"judging the evidence only on the basis of some video footage\\" and declared that \\"given time, we will look scientifically into the different ways of communication. For us, this seems to be the proper way.\\"Filip Salmon (28 November 2009). \\"Rom is geen circusnummer (Rom is no circus act)\\". De Standaard. (in Dutch) Disproof Laureys later concluded that messages attributed to Houben through Wouters' facilitation were not, in fact, coming from Houben after all. After the early tests, further testing met with resistance. Using a different facilitator, subsequent testing under properly controlled conditions in which fifteen objects which were shown to Houben over a period of weeks was performed, Houben was unable to communicate knowledge of any of the objects which had been shown to him during the facilitator's absence.Manfred Dworschak (13 February 2010). \\"Communicating with those trapped within their brains\\".

Born in Wigan, Greater Manchester, England, he moved at the age of four to Calne, Wiltshire, where he grew up, though he still holds deep roots in Wigan. He currently resides in New York. Early life Long learned cello and guitar and started writing songs when he was 18. His earliest performing experience was as lead guitarist in a local grunge band. Long moved to London in 2005 to attend London Metropolitan University where he studied sound and media for films. He began playing open-mic nights at local clubs, meeting several like- minded young musicians, among them Sam Bradley, Marcus Foster, Jack Whitehall, and Robert Pattinson, whose careers as actors were just beginning. Long's career trajectory took a major leap when Pattinson performed the song \\"Let Me Sign,\\" co-written by Long and Foster, in the 2008 blockbuster vampire film Twilight. Career Long graduated from college in June 2009 (earning a degree in music for films after writing his senior thesis on the social impact of American folk music) and commenced performing full-time. A spring series of showcase dates introduced him to American audiences in New York, Los Angeles and Nashville. By July, he embarked on the critically well-received \\"Dangerous Summer\\" tour. Long fans, who first discovered his music via the Twilight soundtrack, turned out for shows throughout the U.S. and Canada and pushed his MySpace page well over one million page views. He recorded the 10-song collection Dirty Pond Songs to be available at his shows. Recorded in his London bedroom, it included traffic noises and all. \\"Left to Lie\\" from Dirty Pond Songs, became an iTunes favourite, topping the site's \\"Unsigned\\" chart and reaching #8 its folk music chart. \\"The Bounty of Mary Jane\\" from Dirty Pond Songs and a live version of his \\"Being a Mockingbird,\\" recorded at Arlene's Grocery in New York City, were also released via iTunes. \\"The Dangerous Summer\\" tour continued until the end of 2009, logging some 80 performances in all. Long embarked upon the \\"Left to Lie\\" tour of Europe in early 2010 and recorded his first studio CD with Grammy-winning producer, Liam Watson at Toe Rag Studios in London. He also released a collection of live performances from the Dangerous Summer 2009 tour. \\"My Darling Belle\\" from that collection went to No. 2 on iTunes' Singer-Songwriter chart. On 23 April 2010, Long officially signed with ATO Records, the label co-founded by musician Dave Matthews and his manager Corin Capshaw. He opened on tour for Matt Pond PA during which time he met the Kalob Griffin Band, also known as KGB, who would become his backing band for subsequent US dates that year, including the Mile High Festival in Denver, the xPoNential Music Festival in Philadelphia and The Troubadour in Los Angeles. He also did a solo tour of Europe in the fall, followed by North American dates supporting Michael Franti. ATO Records released Bobby Long's debut album, entitled \\"A Winter Tale,\\" on 1 February 2011. Much of that year was devoted to touring in support of the album, including appearances on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on 3 February and on the CBS Early Show on 8 August. He also played high-profile shows like the Bonnaroo Music Festival, Austin City Limits Festival and the Dave Matthews Band Caravan in both Atlantic City and Chicago. In July 2011, Long recorded a five-song EP called \\"The Backing Singer\\" with violinist Jack Dawson and producer Jesse Lauter, followed by fall shows in Canada, the United States and Europe as part of his \\"Losing My Brotherhood\\" tour. Long started 2012 by recording his second album in Los Angeles, produced by Ted Hutt (Old Crow Medicine Show, Flogging Molly) at Kingsize Studios. He toured in support of Rodrigo y Gabriela, Iron & Wine, The Mother Hips and Steve Winwood as well as playing his own shows. In a departure from music, Long published his first book of poetry called \\"Losing My Brotherhood\\" and did a performance/poetry reading at the Barnes and Noble store in Los Angeles. After Hurricane Sandy hit the east coast of the United States in October 2012, Long donated his 1965 Epiphone Cabellero guitar to the Red Cross Hurricane Relief Fund. For the victims, he later participated in the benefit \\"A Love Letter to New York\\" that also included Joan Osborne, Matisyahu, and others. A three-week tour of Europe preceded the 19 February 2013 release of \\"Wishbone,\\" Long's second album for ATO. He toured the U.S. in the spring with a new young band‚Äîmaking two appearances on cable TV's \\"The Artie Lange Show\\"‚Äîand in the summer with mandolin player Rob Dwyer (of KGB), joined occasionally by violinist Jack Dawson. This lineup appeared on AXS Television's AXS Live program and at the Troubadour in Los Angeles. Long devoted 2014 to writing and preparing to record his third album, playing sporadic solo shows in between. In June, he launched a fund-raising campaign on PledgeMusic to finance the album and reached his goal in a scant five weeks. The album was recorded in a two-week period in September, produced by Mark Hallman at his Congress House Studios in Austin, Texas. The short film called See Seven States from Rock City, featuring Long's song \\"In Ashes\\" and two others, received its premiere showing at the Williamsburg Independent Film Festival in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York in November that year. In 2015, Long signed an agreement with Compass Records in Nashville for the album he had now named \\"Ode To Thinking\\" after the first track on it. With photography from a friend, Jamie Strachan and cover design from a friend (and Grammy nominee) Brett Kilroe, \\"Ode To Thinking\\" was released on 7 August 2015, and the \\"Ode To Thinking\\" tour of the U.S., Europe and U.K. in support of it began. This followed his first ever appearance at England's famed Glastonbury Music Festival on 27 June 2015, where he performed with a band on the Acoustic Stage. Personal life Long is married with a son named, River.

It is one of the best known Anglo-Saxon buildings, in part due to its role in Thomas Rickman's identification of the style. It has been subject to major excavations. The former Church of England church is now run by English Heritage and houses an exhibition exploring its history.  Origins  The church lies immediately east of the remains of a near circular enclosure which contained a hall. This is, on average, in diameter and was originally surrounded by a ditch and timber palisade known to date to before 900. An early pagan Saxon cemetery, believed to be linked with this enclosure and dated to the first half of the seventh century, was discovered at Castledyke, south of the church, and was used to bury high-status individuals. In 669 Saint Chad founded a monastery in neighbouring Barrow-upon-Humber. An Anglo-Saxon charter dated 971 suggests that Barton became a grange attached to this monastery.Barrie Cox, \\"The pattern of Old English burh in early Lindsey\\", in Anglo-Saxon England: 23, p.44Ann Williams, \\"A bell-house and a burgh-geat\\", in Robert Liddiard, Anglo-Norman Castles, pp.34‚Äì36 The earliest graves on the site of the church date from the ninth century, around one hundred years after the southerly cemetery was abandoned. At this stage, it appears to have been reserved for burials associated with the hall and there may have been an associated chapel, although no trace of this remains. This was Barton's first Christian cemetery.Gail Drinkall and Martin Foreman, The Anglo-Saxon cemetery at Castledyke South, Barton-on-Humber, pp.16, 24, 363‚Äì364 View from the tower to the baptistery The dating of the church is somewhat controversial. English Heritage date the baptistery to the ninth century and the tower nave to the tenth century. Some other sources give a slightly later date, between 970 and 1030. In particular, it is uncertain whether the baptistery does predate the tower or if the two are contemporary.Simon Jenkins, England's Thousand Best Churches, p.367 Around the date of construction the ditch to the east was infilled, allowing level access between the hall and the church. Unusually, graves disturbed by the laying of foundations were carefully relocated.Dawn M. Hadley and Jo Buckbery, Pastoral care in late Anglo-Saxon England, in Francesca Tinti, Pastoral care in late Anglo-Saxon England, p.132-134 Architecture The church was originally turriform: the ground floor of the tower served as the nave.Ernest Arthur Fisher, An Introduction to Anglo-Saxon Architecture and Sculpture, London: Faber, 1959, OCLC 1279628, p. 57. The tower shows typical features of Saxon architecture: walls of rendered rubble, with decorative pilaster strip work, and long and short work.Timothy Darvill et al, England: an Oxford archaeological guide to sites from earliest times to AD 1600, p.135 The pilasters do not provide any possible support‚Äîsome are only very shallowly set into the wall. They are cut from Roman ashlars.Warwick Rodwell, \\"Anglo Saxon Church Building: Aspects of Design and Construction\\", in The Archaeology of Anglo-Saxon England: Basic Readings, pp.196‚Äì225 Oak beams survive at two levels in the tower; these would originally have supported higher floors. The first floor must have been a gallery, as there are no windows at ground floor level. The tower has only a few, small, windows, with either round or triangular heads, and they are divided by a shaft. There are north and south doorways, which appear to have originally possessed timber porches. The roof would have been of timber construction, probably of stepped pyramidal form, and covered with shingles. The tower is linked to the baptistery by a narrow doorway, which originally had a timber doorcase. Excavations have revealed a font base buried in the floor of the room. Externally, it is plainer than the tower, with even fewer, simple windows. On the opposite side of the tower to the baptistery, a chancel was constructed. Foundations of a permanent altar and a screen have been found under this space. Both baptistery and chancel would have had flat ceilings with attics above. The medieval nave Barton thrived as a town, and was recorded in the Domesday Book housing two mills and a ferry, worth ¬£4 per year. In the early Norman period, perhaps the late eleventh century, a third storey was added to the tower of St Peter's, using dressed limestone in a Romanesque style. The chancel of St Peter's was demolished c.1100 to make way for a larger early Norman building east of the existing tower, the foundations of which were found under the present nave during the 1970s excavation. This was gradually expanded in the 12th and 13th century before being largely replaced in the fourteenth century by the present nave and chancel. The earliest parts of this extension are in the Decorated Gothic style, with some of the arcade capitals reused from the earlier building. One of these depicts a Green Man. The window at the east end of the north aisle, now inside the church because of the later addition to the east, contains a rare example of figural carving on the tracery. It is of the mid-14th century, with four lights and flowing tracery, and carved against the central mullion is a rood flanked by the Virgin and St John on the other two mullions: a complete rood group. The clerestory dates from around 1430. The chancel was rebuilt in the second half of the 15th century, and the east window retains fragments of early 14th-century stained glass depicting Saint George and Saint James. Other historic monuments include the fifteenth century chancel effigy and rood screen, and wall monuments from the late sixteenth century. In about 1310 a cross was constructed in the churchyard. This is Grade II listed in its own right, as is part of the churchyard wall. Early investigations Thomas Rickman, a keen architectural historian and author of An Attempt to Discriminate the Styles of English Architecture,\\"Rickman, Thomas\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography investigated the church in 1819. His inspection led him to describe the principle of \\"structural stratification\\"‚Äîwhere one phase of building rests on another, the second must be of an earlier date. This enabled him, for the first time, to persuasively argue that a standing structure must be of Anglo- Saxon date, as the Norman top storey of the tower was supported by two stories constructed in a very different, then unknown, style.Current archaeology, Issues 76‚Äì89, p.209 Previously, while some work had been labelled as Saxon, this was all Romanesque, and only guesswork attempted to distinguish this from Norman architecture. Rickman presented his influential hypothesis that St Peter's and St Thomas of Canterbury Church, Clapham possessed Saxon towers in an updated edition of An Attempt to Discriminate....Thomas Rickman, An attempt to discriminate the styles of architecture in England (5th Edition), pp.55‚Äì56 Excavation and restoration View from the south east, showing the nave, south aisle, porch and tower The church has been Grade A listed in 1965, a status since converted to Grade I. It was closed in 1970, its former chapel- of-ease, St Mary's, becoming the parish church. Ownership was taken over by the Department of the Environment.St Peter's Church Project Barton-upon-Humber Harold McCarter Taylor identified the church as an ideal location for an archaeological excavation, given that it was, uniquely, a substantial Saxon church which was no longer used for worship. He noted that, as the building had been examined repeatedly by architectural historians, there was little possibility of resolving the considerable questions about its construction and history without excavations. In 1977, he secured funding from the Department of the Environment, and began the most extensive archaeological investigation ever undertaken of a British parish church, not completed until 1985. 3,000 skeletons were removed from the site, providing what has been described as \\"an osteological record unparalleled for any small town in England\\". Due to waterlogged conditions, in some cases, wooden coffins had also survived. Some of these were dug-out logs, while some are believed to be constructed from old boats. At least ten burials were accompanied by hazel rods, and one had a pillow of organic material. Alongside the excavation, extensive repairs to the building were undertaken.

The 2007 price peak is clearly visible. The uranium bubble of 2007 was a period of nearly exponential growth in the price of natural uranium, starting in 2005 and peaking at roughly $300/kg (or ~$135/lb) in mid-2007. This coincided with significant rises of stock price of uranium mining and exploration companies. After mid-2007, the price began to fall again and at the end of 2010, was relatively stable at around $100/kg. Causes The upward trend for the prices of uranium was already apparent since 2003. This prompted increases in mining activity. A possible direct cause for the bubble is the flooding of the Cigar Lake Mine, Saskatchewan, which has the largest undeveloped high-grade uranium ore deposits in the world. This created uncertainty about short-term future of the uranium supply. Other factors are speculation triggered by growing expectations around India and China's nuclear programs, and a reduction in available weapons-grade uranium.http://www.cfr.org/energy/global- uranium-supply-demand/p14705 Impact The impact of the bubble on nuclear power generation was small, as most power plants have long-term uranium delivery contracts, and the price of natural uranium makes up only a small fraction of their operating cost. However, the sharp fall in prices after mid-2007 caused a lot of new companies focused on exploration and mining to lose their viability and go out of business.

He was described as one of the most \\"mysterious and influential clandestine operators\\" of the era.Ladislas Farago The Game of the Foxes 1971  Early life  De Ropp was born in Lithuania, the last child of Wilhelm Edmund Karl Reinhold Alexander Baron von der Ropp and his wife Lydia Gurjef. His father was from a family of Prussian barons and owned an estate called Daudzegir, while his mother was a Cossack from the Crimea.De Ropp, Robert S., Warrior's Way: a Twentieth Century Odyssey (Nevada City, CA: Gateways, 1995 and 2002) De Ropp was educated in Dresden, Germany.The Appeasers.

When he took the oath of allegiance on 25 January 1915, he was described as an Electrical Engineer of Kensington, London.  Career  During the First World War, de Ropp served in the Royal Flying Corps under the command of F. W. Winterbotham. In the 1920s, de Ropp went to Berlin as a representative of the Bristol Aircraft Company and became an associate of Alfred Rosenberg, a fellow Balt and a Nazi enthusiast. Rosenberg's function was to establish links with establishment figures in Britain for the Nazis. De Ropp had contacts with a powerful segment of the British upper class which favoured appeasement, known as the \\"Cliveden Set\\", and also with a member of the royal family, the Duke of Kent.Jonathan Petropoulos, Royals and the Reich: The Princes von Hessen in Nazi Germany (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 201 Through Rosenberg, de Ropp met Adolf Hitler and Rudolf Hess. According to Ladislas Farago, a close personal relationship developed between the F√ºhrer and de Ropp. Hitler used him as a confidential consultant on British affairs and outlined to him frankly his grandiose plans, described by one author as \\"a trust no other foreigner enjoyed to this extent\\".Ladislas Farago, The Game of the Foxes, p. 88 Lulled by this congenial atmosphere, the Luftwaffe naively gave away its secrets to the British. F. W. Winterbotham had become head of Air Intelligence, part of MI6, and nurtured de Ropp over three years. While the Nazis considered de Ropp one of their agents in England, his standing helped facilitate a visit by Winterbotham to Germany in 1934. Winterbotham met Rosenberg and Goering and obtained a considerable amount of information on the growth of the Luftwaffe.Chris Staerck, Paul Sinnott, Luftwaffe: the allied intelligence files (2002), p. 3  Family  De Ropp married Ruth Fisher and had a son, Robert, and a daughter named Ruth. His wife died in the 1918 influenza pandemic. In 1925 he married Marie Woodman.Office for National Statistics - Marriage Indices His son Robert de Ropp, with whom he maintained little contact, became a research biochemist and author on personal enlightenment.

Pitch coherence is achieved by concentrating the material on three hierarchically prominent chords, which increase in importance as the quartet progresses. Two of these are tetrachords, the third a hexachord. In Carter's Harmony Book, the four-note chords are numbers 18 and 23, and the six-note chord is number 35.Kim 2006, 9. The quartet represents two simultaneous \\"creative processes\\". In performance, the musicians appear to be first trying out and rehearsing musical ideas (in the introduction and interludes), and then playing them (in the even-numbered movements). At the same time, the sketches show that this mirrors the composer's compositional process as he worked out small sections, not writing linearly from beginning to end, but by assembling small phrases together and polishing them.Schiff 1998, 92. The strong characters of the Quartet's materials emerge as a result of the conflict and resolution of rhythmic articulation created during metric modulation. Through the concept of the \\"time screen\\", however, Carter creates a gravitational pull toward a central tempo of = 96, the \\"imperceptible heart beat\\" of the quartet, which generally remains hidden. Because a sense of tempo relies on a clearly established regular pulse, and Carter only creates such unambiguous passages during metric modulations, it is at those transitions where these rhythmic identities become clear.Kim 2006, 90‚Äì91, 109‚Äì111.

Stratified in age-related sequence, the deposits represent every major prehistoric period from the Middle Archaic to the Late Woodland. The site's dominant component holds the remains of an early Late Woodland (500‚Äì1000 CE) village inhabited by people of the Clemson Island culture. The convergent streams and their two valleys made the site readily accessible to pre-Columbian people living in both drainage basins. Among the components of the site are two strata, dating from 5000-6000 and c. 2600 BP respectively. Both components were radiocarbon dated from fragments of Cucurbita pepo, the squash plant; the absence of wild squash plants near the site and its distance from well-documented wild populations is evidence that the gourds were intentionally brought to the location by humans.Fritz, Gayle J. \\"Gender and the Early Cultivation of Gourds in Eastern North America\\".

Spo11 catalyzes a double strand break (DSB) in one of the two homologous chromosomes to induce meiotic recombination. The repair of these DSBs are monitored at a DSB-dependent meiotic recombination checkpoint while at the DSB-independent meiotic recombination checkpoint the asynapsis of each homolog pair is examined. Generally speaking, the cell cycle regulation of meiosis is similar to that of mitosis. As in the mitotic cycle, these transitions are regulated by combinations of different gene regulatory factors, the cyclin-Cdk complex and the anaphase-promoting complex (APC). The first major regulatory transition occurs in late G1, when the start of meiotic cycle is activated by Ime1 instead of Cln3/Cdk1 in mitosis. The second major transition occurs at the entry into metaphase I. The main purpose of this step is to make sure that DNA replication has completed without error so that spindle pole bodies can separate. This event is triggered by the activation of M-Cdk in late prophase I. Then the spindle assembly checkpoint examines the attachment of microtubules at kinetochores, followed by initiation of metaphase I by APCCdc20. The special chromosome separation in meiosis, homologous chromosomes separation in meiosis I and chromatids separation in meiosis II, requires special tension between homologous chromatids and non- homologous chromatids for distinguishing microtubule attachment and it relies on the programmed DNA double strand break (DSB) and repair in prophase I. Therefore meiotic recombination checkpoint can be a kind of DNA damage response at specific time spot. On the other hand, the meiotic recombination checkpoint also makes sure that meiotic recombination does happen in every pair of homologs. DSB-dependent pathway The abrupt onset of M-Cdk in late prophase I depends on the positive transcription regulation feedback loop consisting of Ime2, Ndt80 and Cdk/cyclin complex. However the activation of M-Cdk is controlled by the general phosphorylation switch Wee1/Cdc25. Wee1 activity is high in early prophase I and the accumulation of Cdc25 activates M-Cdk by direct phosphorylation and marking Wee1 to be degraded. Meiotic recombination may begin with a double-strand break, either induced by Spo11 or by other endogenous or exogenous causes of DNA damage. These DNA breaks must be repaired before metaphase I. and these DSBs must be repaired before metaphase I. The cell monitor these DSBs via ATM pathway, in which Cdc25 is suppressed when DSB lesion is detected. This pathway is the same as classical DNA damage response and is the part we know the best in meiotic recombination checkpoint. DSB-independent pathway The DSB-independent pathway was proposed when people studied spo11 mutant cells in some species and found that these Spo11 cells could not process to metaphase I even in the absence of DSB. The direct purpose of these DSBs is to help with the condensation of chromosomes. Even though the initial homolog paring in early leptotene is just random interactions, the further progression into presynaptic alignment depends on the formation of double strand breaks and single strand transfer complexes. Therefore the unsynapsed chromosomes in Spo11 cells can be a target of checkpoint. An AAA‚Äìadenosine triphosphatase (AAA-ATPase) was found to be essential in this pathway. but the mechanism is not yet clear. Some other studies also drew sex body formation into attention, and the signaling could be either structure based or transcription regulation such as meiotic sex chromosome inactivation. Under this cascade, failure to synapse will maintain the gene expression from sex chromosomes and some products may inhibit cell cycle progression. Meiotic sex chromosome inactivation only happens in male, which may partially be the reason why only Spo11 mutant spermatocytes but not oocytes fail to transition from prophase I to metaphase I. However the asynapsis does not happen only within sex chromosomes, and such transcription regulation was suspended until it was further expanded to all the chromosomes as meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin, but the effector gene is not found yet. Meiotic checkpoint protein kinases CHEK1 and CHEK2 The central role in meiosis of human and mouse CHEK1 and CHEK2 and their orthologs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Drosophila has been reviewed by MacQueen and Hochwagen and Subramanian and Hochwagen. During meiotic recombination in human and mouse, CHEK1 protein kinase is important for integrating DNA damage repair with cell cycle arrest. CHEK1 is expressed in the testes and associates with meiotic synaptonemal complexes during the zygonema and pachynema stages. CHEK1 likely acts as an integrator for ATM and ATR signals and in monitoring meiotic recombination. In mouse oocytes CHEK1 appears to be indispensable for prophase I arrest and to function at the G2/M checkpoint. CHEK2 regulates cell cycle progression and spindle assembly during mouse oocyte maturation and early embryo development. Although CHEK2 is a down stream effector of the ATM kinase that responds primarily to double-strand breaks it can also be activated by ATR (ataxia- telangiectasia and Rad3 related) kinase that responds primarily to single- strand breaks. In mouse, CHEK2 is essential for DNA damage surveillance in female meiosis. The response of oocytes to DNA double-strand break damage involves a pathway hierarchy in which ATR kinase signals to CHEK2 which then activates p53 and p63 proteins. In the fruitfly Drosophila, irradiation of germ line cells generates double-strand breaks that result in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The Drosophila CHEK2 ortholog mnk and the p53 ortholog dp53 are required for much of the cell death observed in early oogenesis when oocyte selection and meiotic recombination occur.  Meiosis-specific Transcription factor Ndt80  Ndt80 is a meiosis-specific transcription factor required for successful completion of meiosis and spore formation. The protein recognizes and binds to the middle sporulation element (MSE) 5'-C[AG]CAAA[AT]-3' in the promoter region of stage-specific genes that are required for progression through meiosis and sporulation. The DNA-binding domain of Ndt80 has been isolated, and the structure reveals that this protein is a member of the Ig-fold family of transcription factors. Ndt80 also competes with the repressor SUM1 for binding to promoters containing MSEs.  Transitions in yeast  When a mutation inactivates Ndt80 in budding yeast, meiotic cells display a prolonged delay in late pachytene, the third stage of prophase. The cells display intact synaptonemal complexes but eventually arrest in the diffuse chromatin stage that follows pachytene. This checkpoint- mediated arrest prevents later events from occurring until earlier events have been executed successfully and prevents chromosome missegregation.  Role in cell cycle progression  NDt80 is crucial for the completion of prophase and entry into meiosis 1, as it stimulates the expression of a large number of middle meiotic genes. Ndt80 is regulated through transcriptional and post- translational mechanisms (i.e. phosphorylation). = Interaction with Clb1 = Ndt80 stimulates the expression of the B-type cyclin Clb-1, which greatly interacts with Cdk1 during meiotic divisions. Active complexes of Clb-1 with Cdk1 play a large role in triggering the events of the first meiotic division, and their activity is restricted to meiosis 1. = Interaction with Ime2 = Ndt80 stimulates expression of itself and expression of protein kinase Ime2, both of which feedback to further stimulate Ndt80. This increased amount of Ndt80 protein further enhances the transcription of target genes. Early in meiosis 1, Ime2 activity rises and is required for the normal accumulation and activity of Ndt80. However, if Ndt80 is expressed prematurely, it will initially accumulate in an unmodified form. Ime2 can then also act as a meiosis-specific kinase that phosphorylates Ndt80, resulting in fully activated Ndt80. = Expression of Plk = Ndt80 stimulates the expression of the gene that encodes polo-like kinase, Plk. This protein is activated in late pachytene and is needed for crossover formation and partial loss of cohesion from chromosome arms. Plk is also both necessary and sufficient to trigger exit from pachytene points. = Recombination model = The meiotic recombination checkpoint operates in response to defects in meiotic recombination and chromosome synapsis, potentially arresting cells before entry into meiotic divisions. Because recombination is initiated by double stranded breaks (DSBs) at certain regions of the genome, entry into Meiosis 1 must be delayed until the DSBs are repaired. The meiosis-specific kinase Mek1 plays an important role in this and recently, it has been discovered that Mek1 is able to phosphorylate Ndt80 independently of IME2. This phosphorylation, however, is inhibitory and prevents Ndt80 from binding to MSEs in the presence of DSBs.  Roles outside of cell cycle progression  = Heterokaryon Incompatibility = Heterokaryon Incompatibility (HI) has been likened to a fungal immune system; it is a non-self recognition mechanism that is ubiquitous among filamentous members of the Asomycota phylum of the Fungi kingdom. Vib-1 is an Ndt80 homologue in Neurospora crassa and is required for HI in this species. It has been found that mutations at the vib1 locus suppress non-self recognition, and VIB-1 is required for the production of downstream effectors associated with HI, such as extracellular proteases. = Female sexual development = Studies have indicated that Ndt80 homologues also play a role in female sexual development in fungi species other than the more commonly studied Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mutations in vib-1 have been found to affect the timing and development of female reproductive structures prior to fertilization.  Role in Cancer  Although usually characterized in yeast and other fungi, the DNA-binding domain of Ndt80 is homologous to a number of proteins in higher eukaryotes and the residues used for binding are highly conserved. In humans, the Ndt80 homologue C11orf9 is highly expressed in invasive or metastatic tumor cells, suggesting potential usage as a target molecule in cancer treatment. However, not much progress has been made on this front in recent years.

He was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys in the second round of the 2011 NFL Draft. He played college football at the University of North Carolina. Early years Carter attended Havelock High School in Havelock, North Carolina. He played quarterback, safety and running back for the football team. As a senior, he rushed for 1,063 yards with 15 touchdowns as a running back and threw for 585 yards and five touchdowns as a quarterback. Considered a three-star recruit by Rivals.com, Carter was listed as the No. 33 safety prospect in the nation. College career Freshman year Carter was converted to linebacker in college. In the Tar Heels' season opener, against James Madison, Carter got his first blocked punt. The football was recovered in the end zone by a fellow Tar Heel for a touchdown. Carter started his first game as a Tar Heel in the game against East Carolina, he garnered four tackles during the game. As a freshman in 2007 Carter started seven of 12 games, recording 25 tackles. Sophomore year As a sophomore in 2008 Carter started all 13 games at outside linebacker. In the game against Rutgers, Carter intercepted a pass and returned it 66 yards for a touchdown, this was the first touchdown of his career. In the Tar Heels' game against Miami, Carter blocked one punt. The blocked punt proved to be crucial, as the Tar Heels drove 56 yards down the field and scored after the punt was blocked. One of Bruce Carter's best games of his sophomore season was the game against Connecticut. The blocking of three punts in one game earned Carter the ACC record for most punts blocked in a single game. In that game he recorded three blocked punts, all of which occurred during the second quarter of the game. In the Tar Heels' loss to the Virginia Cavaliers, Carter blocked a Cavalier field goal attempt. He finished the season with 68 tackles, five sacks, an interception, which was returned for a touchdown, and a nation leading five blocked kicks. Junior year Carter started all 13 games as an outside linebacker. Carter tipped a punt in the Tar Heel's game against the Citadel. In the Tar Heels' game against Georgia Southern, Carter intercepted a pass and returned it 48 yards for a touchdown, this was Carter's second career touchdown. As a junior in 2009, Carter has 48 tackles, a sack, and an interception. Carter earned a career-high 13 tackles in the game against NC State. Carter was voted to Second-Team All-ACC. This was Carter's only season where he did not record a blocked punt. Senior year Carter returned an interception 55 yards for a touchdown in the third game of the season against Rutgers. In that game Carter also recorded a blocked punt and seven tackles. Carter's senior season was cut short due to a knee injury, which dropped his draft stock. He sustained the injury during the game against NC State. He would miss the last two games of the season against Duke and the 2010 Music City Bowl, which was played against Tennessee Volunteers. He was a finalist for the 2010 Butkus Award, but lost to Von Miller of Texas A&M.; He finished his final season as a Tar Heel with 57 tackles, 3.5 tackles for loss, 2.5 sacks, and one forced fumble. Carter was again voted to Second-Team All-ACC. Professional career Dallas Cowboys =2011 season= Carter was considered one of the top linebacker prospects for the 2011 NFL Draft. Carter was projected as a first round draft pick before sustaining an ACL injury in his left knee during his senior season. The Dallas Cowboys selected him in the second round (40th overall) of the 2011 NFL Draft. He spent his rookie season recovering from the injury. On October 29, he was activated from the non- football injury list to the Cowboys active roster, taking the spot of the waived Tashard Choice. His participation was mostly limited to special teams, playing only a total of 41 defensive snaps. =2012 season= Entering the 2012 season the team decided not to resign Keith Brooking and Bradie James, because they considered Carter to be ready to start at inside linebacker next to Sean Lee, after playing outside linebacker for most of his college career. The Cowboys also signed Dan Connor as a free agent to compete with Carter and to protect themselves in case he couldn't earn a starting role. That potential competition never materialized, because Carter would end up having a break out year, even expanding his role after Lee was placed on injured reserve in October. He finished second on the team with 70 tackles, despite being placed on injured reserve for the final five games, after dislocating his left elbow on Thanksgiving Day. =2013 season= In 2013, defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin was hired to change the defense to a 4-3 alignment, so he was switched to weakside linebacker, which was the same role in the Tampa 2 defense made famous by hall of famer Derrick Brooks. Although he was seen as a natural fit and there were high expectations placed on him, he struggled in preseason, where he started being platooned with Ernie Sims. These difficulties carried on into the regular season and after a poor performance against the San Diego Chargers, he was benched for the first time at any level. After two games he regained his starter role over Sims and finished with 96 tackles (third on the team) and 2 sacks. =2014 season= In 2014, he was moved to strongside linebacker, so he could line behind the three-technique right defensive tackle position and be free to make plays. He suffered a right quadriceps injury against the New Orleans Saints and was lost for three games. Although his playing time was reduced in November, losing his starting role after the game against the Arizona Cardinals, he would finish strong while concentrating on the nickel defense and special teams, finishing with 68 tackles, 5 interceptions (led the team), 8 passes defensed and a blocked punt. Tampa Bay Buccaneers On March 11, 2015, he signed a four-year contract with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Although he was projected to start at middle linebacker, he was moved to sam linebacker, after rookie Kwon Alexander outperformed him in training camp. He was used mostly as a backup (only 3 starts), finishing with 47 tackles, 2 sacks and 2 passes defensed. On March 8, 2016, he was waived in a salary cap move. New York Jets =2016 season= Carter signed a one-year contract with the New York Jets on April 2. He appeared in 13 games, registering 13 defensive tackles and 5 special teams tackles. =2017 season= On May 4, Carter re-signed with the Jets on a one year contract. He played in 14 games. Atlanta Falcons Carter and his teammates in a game against the Washington Redskins On September 25, 2018, Carter was signed by the Atlanta Falcons. On February 11, 2019, Carter signed a one-year contract extension with the Falcons. He was released on August 31, 2019.

He was son of Church of Ireland clergyman, the Reverend Hugh Stewart, Rector of Termonmaguirk, County Tyrone. He was educated in Drogheda and at Trinity College, Dublin, studied law at Lincoln's Inn, and was called to the Irish Bar in 1781. History of Parliament Online article. In 1794, he was elected to the Irish House of Commons for Augher. At the 1797 elections, he was elected for four constituencies: Askeaton, Bangor, Portarlington and Strabane. He chose to sit for Bangor, and held that seat until the dissolution of the Parliament of Ireland when the Act of Union came into effect in 1801. He was Solicitor-General for Ireland from 1798 to 1799 and Attorney-General for Ireland from 1799 to 1803. He was High Sheriff of County Tyrone in 1809. After the Act of Union he was elected to the Parliament of the United Kingdom as Tory Member of Parliament (MP) for Tyrone from 1802 to 1806 and 1812 until his death in 1825. Stewart married in 1789, Mary, daughter of Mervyn Archdale of Castle Archdale, near Enniskillen, with whom he had two sons and a daughter. Driving a two horse carriage while suffering from long term sickness, he was badly injured when his horses bolted and died four days later in June 1825. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his elder son, Hugh.
