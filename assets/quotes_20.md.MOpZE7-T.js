She fled the German attack on Warsaw in September 1939 and took up residence in Soviet-occupied Lviv and eventually in the Soviet Union. She was the founder of the Union of Polish Patriots there and played an important role in the creation of the Polish 1st Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko Infantry Division. The division developed into the Polish People's Army and fought on the Eastern Front during World War II. Wasilewska was a trusted consultant to Joseph Stalin and her influence was essential to the establishment of the Polish Committee of National Liberation in July 1944, and thus to the formation of the Polish People's Republic.  Biography   Before World War II  Wasilewska was born, the second of three daughters, on 25 January 1905 in Krak√≥w, Poland. Her father was Leon Wasilewski, a Polish Socialist Party (PPS) politician and first foreign minister of the newly re-emerging independent Poland. Her mother, Wanda Zieleniewska, was also a PPS member and the young Wasilewska had gotten to know the party leaders at home. From 1923 she studied Polish language and Polish literature at the Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w, where several years later she achieved her doctorate. While studying, she became involved with the Union of Independent Socialist Youth (ZNMS, allied with the PPS) and the Society of Workers' Universities. From the early 1930s, Wasilewska was strongly involved in women's issues and gender equality. Her attitude was exemplified by her own personal conduct as well as her work in the Women's Section of the PPS. However, she eventually chose to emphasize in her activism the broader class issues, remarked that it was easier to deal with men and criticized Warsaw feminists for coloring their movement with \\"feminism of half a century ago\\". Wasilewska joined the PPS as a student. She was a member of the main party council in 1934‚Äì37. She served there with her father, whose connections turned out helpful at the various stages and vicissitudes of her career in Poland. Wasilewska later wrote of her student PPS years: \\"We had a lot of trouble with the communists because they were adamant about carrying out actions that could lead to bloodshed and we thought that was something that should not be done. Rather, we were into innocent skirmishes with the police ... \\". Her radicalism grew gradually from the early 1930s and she began viewing the socialists as former revolutionaries turned conformists, compromised by collaboration with state authorities. Writing to her mother in November 1931, Wasilewska characterized herself as \\"turning increasingly Bolshevik\\", and in the spring of 1932 she joined a radical youth faction that pushed for confrontation with the Sanation regime and advocated joint action with the communists within the newly-established Popular Front alliance. At that time she wrote to her mother of the \\"desperation of the people\\" and concluded: \\"the communists will do something or we will, or we together with the communists\\". As Wasilewska drew closer to the communists, her relations with the PPS deteriorated and she lost her seat in the party council, but never left the organization. Having finished her studies, Wasilewska started working as a secondary school teacher in Krak√≥w, but lost her job when the school authorities refused to extend her contract because of her leftist views. With her husband Marian Bogatko, also dismissed from work as a strike organizer, in autumn 1934 they moved to Warsaw, where Wasilewska became involved with the Polish section of the International Red Aid, an organization concerned with helping political prisoners and their families, and the Polish League for the Defense of Human and Citizens' Rights. Wasilewska found employment in the Editorial Division of the Polish Teachers' Union. She met there and befriended Janina Broniewska, the wife of revolutionary poet W≈Çadys≈Çaw Broniewski; Janina's radical views would significantly influence Wasilewska. Wasilewska was a journalist for various left-wing newspapers, among them Naprz√≥d, Robotnik, Dziennik Popularny, Oblicze Dnia and Lewar, and the chairperson of the P≈Çomyk and P≈Çomyczek monthlies for children. P≈Çomyk was published under the auspices of the Teachers' Union and its March 1936 issue Wasilewska devoted entirely to the promotion of communist models of upbringing as practised in the Soviet Union. In the aftermath, she was attacked in Polish parliament by Prime Minister Felicjan S≈Çawoj Sk≈Çadkowski, the printing ended up confiscated by the authorities, government restrictions and oversight were imposed on the activities of the Teachers' Union, and Wasilewska lost her job at the Editorial Division. She was often criticised for her radical left-wing views and supported an alliance of all the left-wing parties, including the communists, against the ruling Sanation. Wasilewska was closely associated with the communists from the mid-1930s. In May 1936 Wasilewska, among other left-wing Polish and Western Ukrainian writers, participated in the Lviv Anti- Fascist Congress of Cultural Workers. The gathering of intellectuals and cultural activists passed a resolution declaring their support for international humanist values and opposition to fascism, nationalism, capitalism, imperialism and war; it did not invoke a Soviet leadership. Wasilewska left the congress convinced that \\"today the place of the writer, of the artist is among the proletariat of towns and villages, fighting for its liberation\\". Among the labour actions actively supported by Wasilewska was the 1937 strike of the Polish Teachers' Union, coordinated by her together with Janina Broniewska. In Poland Wasilewska, despite her own established position, was known as \\"Leon's daughter\\". Leon Wasilewski died in December 1936. Wasilewska recounted her comrades and communists bringing to his funeral a wreath with an inscription that reads: \\"For Wanda's father\\". It is not clear what Wasilewska's position was on Stalin's persecution and extermination of Polish communists and the 1938 dissolution of the Communist Party of Poland ordered by the Comintern (she seems to have justified a \\"necessity\\" of \\"certain actions\\", given the pressure and isolation that the Soviet state was subjected to), but on the eve of World War II she was a firm supporter of the Soviet Union, which she saw as the only force capable of stopping fascism. Wasilewska was highly regarded and accomplished in the field of social work. Helping the needy, especially children, was her natural inclination and passion. Early in the period of her studies Wasilewska met Roman Szyma≈Ñski, a mathematics student and popular PPS activist. They married and had a daughter Ewa. Szyma≈Ñski, however, died of typhus in August 1931. Later the same year Wasilewska met Marian Bogatko, a construction worker active in the PPS. Their successful relationship, purposely not sanctioned by traditional marriage, became a formal marriage in late 1936, when Wasilewska and Bogatko needed documents to travel to the Soviet Union. Bogatko was murdered by Soviet agents in May 1940 in Lviv. At that time Wasilewska was already a delegate to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. There are different versions of what had happened or who was the actual target. Nikita Khrushchev later wrote: \\"Wasilewska believed that it was not the case of premeditation and continued active work\\"; according to him, Bogatko was killed by mistake.  During World War II  After the Invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany in September 1939, Wasilewska, like hundreds of thousands of other Poles, fled to the east and following Stalin's directions ended up in Lviv (after the Soviet invasion of Poland a part of the Soviet-occupied zone). Like other Polish citizens, she soon automatically became a Soviet citizen, but unlike many she was enthusiastic about the historic turn of events and Poland's prospects under the Soviet tutelage that she expected; she thought it would promote both the national and social liberation of Poles. Wasilewska officially joined as a member the (All-)Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) already in September 1939. According to Khrushchev, the Soviets worked with Wasilewska on organizing the Polish intelligentsia members present in their zone and turning them into Soviet allies. Several dozen Polish literary figures indeed joined the Federation of Soviet Writers of Ukraine in the fall of 1940. Wasilewska prevented a complete Ukrainization of the University of Lviv: because of her intervention part of the Polish prewar faculty remained there and teaching in Polish was retained in some departments. Wasilewska was soon prominent as a Soviet supporter and diplomatic arrangements were made to bring members of her immediate family and her associates from Warsaw to Lviv. Five Poles were exchanged for five Germans in a transaction that took place at what was then the Soviet-German border. She was involved with various communist organisations uniting local Polish and Ukrainian communists. She was a journalist for Czerwony Sztandar ('The Red Banner'), a pro-Soviet newspaper printed in Lviv in Polish from October 1939. Czerwony Sztandar published a declaration signed by Polish writers, including Wasilewska, welcoming the \\"unification of Ukraine\\", meaning the incorporation of the southern part of Kresy into the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. In early 1940 Joseph Stalin, who favored Wasilewska among the Polish communists, awarded her a seat in the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. She became literary director of the Polish Theatre in Lviv, replacing Broniewski, who was arrested by the NKVD. Wasilewska was also one of the founders, together with Jerzy Putrament, of the social-literary monthly Nowe Widnokrƒôgi ('New Horizons'), published from March 1941 and revived in May 1942 with Alfred Lampe. On 28 June 1940, Stalin received Wasilewska, an unofficial leader of Polish communists, at the Moscow Kremlin. The event initiated a reorientation of Soviet policies in regard to Poles, which was reported with concern by the German embassy in Moscow. As a result a wide range of official political, military, social, cultural, educational and other Soviet-Polish projects and activities commenced in 1940 and continued during the years that followed. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Wasilewska fled before the advancing Nazi army and in June 1941 arrived in Moscow. She joined the Red Army as a war correspondent and functionary of the Political Commandment, with the military rank of colonel.Slav Congress, Time Magazine, September 30, 1946 To agitate for the cause of the Great Patriotic War, she tirelessly traversed the many paths of the Soviet-German front, \\"everywhere impatiently awaited\\" by the soldiers. Wasilewska soon wrote the war novel Tƒôcza ('The Rainbow'), instantly translated into Russian. The novel earned her the Stalin Prize and based on it a film was made. According to Jakub Berman, the relationship between Stalin and Wasilewska became one of familiarity; she was free to contact him personally and had his private telephone number. Stalin made no secret of his confidence in Wasilewska, while she displayed considerable moral courage in her handling of the relationship. Following a January 1943 letter written with Lampe to Vyacheslav Molotov and consultations with Stalin, Wasilewska became the head of the Union of Polish Patriots (ZwiƒÖzek Patriot√≥w Polskich, ZPP), a mass-membership political and social organization for Polish citizens in the Soviet Union, officially formed at its founding congress in Moscow in June 1943. The ZPP, where Wasilewska functioned as \\"Stalin's great trustee\\", was oriented toward the establishment of socialism in Poland; it facilitated the development of Poland's post-war government. Wasilewska was very involved in organizing material help for Poles dispersed in many parts of the Soviet Union and Polish schools for children. Nearly thirty thousand Polish children in the Soviet Union, many of them orphans, were taken care of by Wasilewska and her ZPP colleagues; most were returned to Poland after the war. After the Soviets suspended relations with the Polish government-in-exile in late April 1943 (following the revelations of the Katyn massacre), Wasilewska wrote an article in Izvestia sharply critical of the Polish government, which was taken as a sign that no Soviet-Polish government rapprochement was in the offing. On 6 May 1943, in Wasilewska-edited Wolna Polska ('The Free Poland') periodical, the formation of the Polish 1st Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko Infantry Division was announced. Wasilewska and Zygmunt Berling had appealed to Stalin for permission to create a Polish division already in September 1942. Now they accomplished their goal and Stalin's move signaled his definite intention to pursue Poland-related undertakings without regard to the government of Prime Minister W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski. On 15 July 1943, the newly trained and equipped Polish army was shown to the public and the audience included foreign war correspondents. After the parade a press conference was given by Berling and Wasilewska, who spoke on behalf of the ZPP. In October, the Polish army fought the Germans for the first time in the Battle of Lenino. According to Wasilewska, she herself pressed for early deployment of the force. There was a perception of the need to demonstrate, before the Tehran Conference of the Allies, that the Soviet-allied Polish army was already engaged in combat, ahead of the army of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders, which had left the Soviet Union. At Lenino the Poles suffered heavy, but not unusual for the Soviet front casualties. Nevertheless, Wasilewska was appalled by the losses and had the division withdrawn from combat for further training and expansion, until the middle of 1944. Following the battle, the ZPP took it upon itself to award official military medals of the Polish state, such as the Virtuti Militari and the Cross of Valour. In July 1944 Wasilewska became deputy chief of the Polish Committee of National Liberation (PKWN), a provisional government sponsored by the Soviet Union and established in Lublin, in opposition to the Polish government-in-exile in London. On 6‚Äì7 August, together with Boles≈Çaw Bierut and Micha≈Ç Rola-≈ªymierski, Wasilewska conducted in Moscow unsuccessful negotiations with Prime Minister Stanis≈Çaw Miko≈Çajczyk of the government-in- exile (he refused their offer of becoming prime minister of a communist- dominated government). Already in 1942, Wasilewska presented to Ksawery Pruszy≈Ñski the concept of \\"Poland of Boles≈Çaw Krzywousty\\", from the Oder to the Bug River. Geographical vision of post-war Poland, deprived of \\"Kresy\\" eastern lands but compensated with the so-called Recovered Territories in the west, was formed in Wasilewska's discussions with Stalin. Back then the Russian communists demanded a reduction of a potentially hostile future Polish state to lands inhabited by the majority of ethnically Polish people. In July 1944, Wasilewska additionally secured Stalin's consent for the moving of Poland's western border in its southern portion from Nysa K≈Çodzka to Nysa ≈Åu≈ºycka.Joanna Szczƒôsna, Wanda Wasilewska: Bywszaja Polka.

It later caused problems at the Potsdam Conference, because the British wanted to preserve this part of Lower Silesia for the future German state.Halik Kochanski, The Eagle Unbowed, pp. 537‚Äì541. Wasilewska explained away Stalin's deadly purges by arguing that death of an innocent person was preferable to the risk of demise of the Soviet Union. The persecutions and victims, she felt, were an unavoidable cost of future progress or resulted from licentious conduct by functionaries. She intervened when Poles whom she knew were deported to distant regions of the Soviet Union and engaged in relief activities, such as sending parcels to deportees. Wasilewska's interventions freed her fellow Polish communists (kept in detention by Lavrentiy Beria even after the official amnesty for Poles negotiated by the government of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski), the poet Broniewski and his by then estranged wife Janina Broniewska. Broniewska, who went to Moscow and worked for Nowe Widnokrƒôgi, took care of Wasilewska'a daughter Ewa during Wasilewska's lengthy involvement at the German front. When the Polish People's Army was formed, Wasilewska and Broniewska pushed for the use as an emblem on soldier uniforms and elsewhere of a crownless Piast eagle taken from the restored sarcophagus of Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth, a medieval ruler of Poland. The crownless eagle, contrary to the previously and historically used eagle with a crown, was accepted for the army and remained in exclusive use as the coat of arms of Poland throughout the period of existence of communist Poland (1945‚Äì89). Stalin valued Wasilewska's opinion highly, even though (or in part because) she had no prewar background in the Communist Party of Poland. As she later wrote, during the war all the matters were settled through her to the detriment of input from other Polish communists, even though she had not sought a leadership role but rather took advantage of the opportunities as they arose.  After World War II  Memorial plaque in Kiev After the war, Wasilewska decided to stay in the Soviet Union and retired from public life, thus rejecting the opportunity for becoming an active member of the political elites in communist Poland. She was involved in a long-term relationship with Ukrainian playwright and Soviet state official Oleksandr Korniychuk, with whom she moved to Kiev. Wasilewska had limited Russian and Ukrainian language abilities, but was a member of the Supreme Soviet for six terms. She often visited Poland, where a room was kept for her use at the villa of Broniewska in Warsaw. She was highly influential in the affairs of Poland and consulted by the country's top leaders, including Bierut and Berman. Especially before Gomu≈Çka's ascent to power in 1956, Wasilewska's visits followed invitations from the authorities; afterwards they were less frequent and of a more private character. According to communist historian Andrzej Werblan, Wasilewska and Gomu≈Çka were politically incompatible. She made frequent foreign trips as an activist in the peace movement, including one to Stockholm in 1956. Wasilewska wrote to her friend Nikita Khrushchev to complain of the 1955 publication of Poemat dla doros≈Çych ('A Poem for Adults') by Adam Wa≈ºyk, which she saw as one of the manifestations of the increasingly present in Poland anti-socialist agitation. However, after Khrushchev's assumption of the Soviet leadership and his reforms, she seemed primarily preoccupied with her family affairs and by the tending her grandson Peter in particular. She was often visited by family members and friends from Poland. Among other guests Wasilewska and Korniychuk entertained was the writer John Steinbeck. She spent time with her husband in their dacha not far from Kiev, but the relationship eventually deteriorated. She developed heart and circulatory problems. Wanda Wasilewska died on 29 July 1964 in Kiev and is buried in the Baikove Cemetery. Oleksandr Korniychuk, who outlived her by several years, was buried there in another grave.  Role, assessments, influence and works  Wasilewska has \\"her place in Polish collective memory as a symbol of the establishment of the communist order after World War II\\". Brought up in a patriotic, intellectual, left-wing but anti-Russian Polish establishment environment, Wanda Wasilewska gradually developed a communist identity and revolutionary outlook, to become a theorist, ideologue and promoter of communism in Poland. She was \\"strongly embedded in the historical and geopolitical context of her era\\" and blurred in her daily activities and works she produced the distinction between the public or political, and private aspects of her life. The transgressions she engaged in as a radical leftist were of many dimensions and involved transcending the borders of her gender, nationality, and social class (it amounted to \\"rejecting superstition\\", as she put it). Wasilewska writings were heavily socially and ideologically engaged. She accused Sanation Poland of gross discrimination of its citizens based on their rank (the elites vs. the masses) and ethnicity. She pointed to a combination of economic and nationalistic oppression of the working classes and the minorities by the industry and land owners and by people of the dominant Polish language and culture. With the end of the war, Wasilewska removed herself from the position of power to assume other roles. As W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka saw it, later she must have had regretted the decision she made but had to live with it. She \\"played her role till the end\\", but in a letter to her mother complained about the many ailments she suffered from, ascribing them all to \\"nerves\\". Agnieszka Mrozik speculates that Wasilewska's diseased body expressed her reaction to \\"the corset of a monument which she was given to wear\\" and that she may have been \\"stuck\\" in a role which \\"involved ‚Äì apart from the appearance of a fulfilled activist and writer ‚Äì the appearance of a happy woman\\". To some degree, Wasilewska might have been pushed out or discouraged from continuing political career in postwar Poland, because of being a lone woman in the Polish communist leadership or because of her image causing a problem for the new authorities (considered too closely associated with Stalin). Depending on the political orientation of those who judged her and the propaganda needs of the moment, Wasilewska has been depicted in different, often extreme ways. She was a revolutionary icon of the new order and an embodiment of progress under Stalinism. Afterwards, in Gomu≈Çka years, the stress was on her military and social activities as she became a patriotic symbol in the national Romantic tradition. For those strongly opposed to communism, radical leftism or the Soviet domination of Poland, she has been a \\"monstrosity\\" and represented \\"pathology\\" and \\"betrayal\\"; labels such as \\"renegade\\", \\"traitor\\" and \\"collaborator\\" have commonly been used. In particular, her gender has been referenced to deny her as a woman individual agency and define her position relative to men, as in the primary characterizations of \\"Stalin's favorite\\" or \\"Leon's disgraced daughter\\". Adam Cio≈Çkosz, Wasilewska's colleague and friend in her PPS years and an anti-communist √©migr√© in post-war London, wrote \\"biographical sketches\\" about her. He patronizingly described Wasilewska as a well-meaning, even if sometimes rebellious (yet lacking truly radical credentials) woman of proper upbringing but limited intellectual ability and emotional maturity, who at the time of the Soviet invasion of Poland (September 1939) succumbed to a sudden onset of infatuation with the Soviet Union. Wasilewska's biography, according to Mrozik, has been \\"continuously rewritten and corrected\\" by those who wanted to \\"inscribe into her their own content\\". This makes it possible to see her as a \\"liminal character\\", used to mark \\"the boundaries of political periods and ideological attitudes\\". The great Pole, an outstanding writer and diplomat from her pre-1989 biographies became a \\"degenerate daughter of the Polish nation\\" afterwards. Such processing of Wasilewska narrative corresponded with the dominant at a given place and time historical narrative (of pre-1989 Poland, post-1989 Poland, or Polish √©migr√© circles in the West after World War II). Wasilewska was one of the first Polish writers to follow the rules of socialist realism. She wrote several novels and a handful of poems. Oblicze Dnia ('The Face of Day') novel had the printing of its book edition stopped by Sanation censorship (it had already been issued in installments in the leftist Naprz√≥d periodical). After an intervention by Wasilewska's father, the book was published in an expurgated form. However, a Russian translation and edition were soon produced. Around 1936, on several occasions the Soviet Embassy paid Wasilewska compensation for her books published in the Soviet Union. In the Soviet Union, where Wasilewska's literary works were much more appreciated than in Poland, the material she produced, including elements of her personal story, were turned, in accordance with the convention of socialist realism, into a model to be followed by the population. In the early 1950s, Wasilewska and Korniychuk wrote a libretto for Kostiantyn Dankevych's opera Bohdan Khmelnytsky. After it became a target of ideologically-based criticism, the authors submitted self-criticism and revised their work. Wasilewska was a triple recipient of the Stalin Prize for literature (1943, 1946, 1952). During Stalin's lifetime she was considered a classic writer of Soviet literature and her works were included in the Soviet school curriculum. Her \\"collected works\\" were published in Moscow in six volumes in 1955. The first volume was translated into the Ukrainian language and published in Ukraine in 1966. However, after the death of Stalin, Wasilewska was largely forgotten as a writer. The communist government in Poland named countless streets and schools after her and she was one of the most notable figures in communist society. After the war, some of her books were obligatory school reading. * Kr√≥lewski syn (1933) * Oblicze Dnia (1934) * Kryszta≈Çowa Kula Krzysztofa Kolumba (1934) * Ojczyzna (1935) * Legenda o Janie z Kolna (1936) * Ziemia w jarzmie (1938) * P≈Çomie≈Ñ na bagnach (1940) * Pie≈õ≈Ñ nad Wodami (a trilogy: 1940, 1950, 1952) * Tƒôcza (1944) * Po prostu mi≈Ço≈õƒá (1944) * Gdy ≈õwiat≈Ço zap≈Çonie (1946) * Gwiazdy w jeziorze (1950) * Rzeki p≈ÇonƒÖ (1952) * Pok√≥j na poddaszu (1954) * ≈ªe padli≈õcie w boju (1958)  Bibliography  * Aleksander Wat, M√≥j Wiek Warszawa 1990 * Helena Zatorska, Wanda Wasilewska, Warszawa 1977 * Adam Cio≈Çkosz, Wanda Wasilewska: dwa szkice biograficzne, Polonia Book Fund: Londyn 1977 * Eleonora Salwa-Syzdek, Dzia≈Çalno≈õƒá Wandy Wasilewskiej w latach drugiej wojny ≈õwiatowej, Warszawa 1981 * Ed.

H is also called the ideal hyperplane. Similarly, starting from an affine space A, every class of parallel lines can be associated with a point at infinity. The union over all classes of parallels constitute the points of the hyperplane at infinity.

By adding these ideal points, the entire affine space A is completed to a projective space P, which may be called the projective completion of A. Each affine subspace S of A is completed to a projective subspace of P by adding to S all the ideal points corresponding to the directions of the lines contained in S. The resulting projective subspaces are often called affine subspaces of the projective space P, as opposed to the infinite or ideal subspaces, which are the subspaces of the hyperplane at infinity (however, they are projective spaces, not affine spaces).

His stint as Doctor Light is concurrent with that of a superheroine using the same name and nearly identical costume, Kimiyo Hoshi. In 2009, Doctor Light was ranked as IGN's 84th-greatest comic book villain of all time. He made his live-adaptation debut in the series in one episode of Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, played by David Bowe. He also appeared in the second season of the DC Universe series Titans, played by Michael Mosley. Publication history Doctor Light first appeared in Justice League of America #12 and was created by Gardner Fox and Mike Sekowsky. During the 1980s Doctor Light was transitioned from a serious menace to a comedic villain, a transformation which culminated in the DC Comics Bonus Book appearing in The Flash #12 (May 1988). Fictional character biography Origin Criminal physicist Doctor Arthur Light captures the League with light rays after first drawing them in by capturing Aquaman, then sending the League to different planets based on their weaknesses. He then orders Snapper Carr to write this down, before imprisoning him in a light field. He has not realized Superman and Batman impersonated each other, allowing Superman to escape the world he was sent to and rescue the other members. Light fools the League with three duplicates of himself that are apparently committing robberies of light- associated objects, though they are actually placing devices around the world. Green Lantern realizes this trick and fakes his death to track Doctor Light, finally stopping him before he pulls the lever that would have set off the light impulses allowing him to take over the world. A retcon introduced in Secret Origins #37 reveals that this character is actually the second Doctor Light. According to the retcon, his predecessor was his partner at S.T.A.R. Labs, a scientist named Jacob Finlay. Finlay created a technologically advanced suit to control light allowing him to be a minor superhero, but was accidentally killed by Arthur Light (though Finlay's death may have been caused by hiding his costume in a computer console, causing it to malfunction). Light took the suit and the \\"Doctor Light\\" codename. He is periodically haunted by Finlay's ghost through the years, but can use the light generated by the suit to drive off this spirit. Through the Silver and Bronze Ages, Doctor Light is a minor but persistent foe for a number of heroes. He fights the Justice League's former sidekicks, the Teen Titans. In JLA #136, he is one of King Kull's agents with which the Beast-Man hopes to wipe out humanity on all three Earths, helping in the attack on Earth-S by creating perpetual light and darkness on each side of the Earth, and teaming up with the Shade. He is turned to stone by King Kull's satellites, but restored when they are destroyed. He is beaten by Hal Jordan not long after his defeat by the JLA. He then founds the supervillain team the Fearsome Five, but they are also defeated by the Titans, and Light is violently expelled from the Five by his teammates. Each criminal caper leads to Light's defeat, but these defeats were used later as the basis of his humiliation that culminated in the \\"Identity Crisis\\" storyline. Dr. Light was once defeated by Little Boy Blue and his Blue Boys‚Äîa group of non-superpowered children. Suicide Squad Driven by self-doubt and guilt, thanks in part to Finlay's ghostly presence, he volunteers for the Suicide Squad, a group of incarcerated supervillains who perform dangerous missions for the US government in exchange for clemency. On a mission against the patriotism-themed super-team called the \\"Force of July\\", he encounters Sparkler, the Force's youngest member. The presence of a superpowered child reminds him of past defeats and he lashes out, killing Sparkler with a blast through the chest. During his time with the Squad, Light demonstrates a simple desire to be liked by the other members. He sees his chance when a mysterious pie-armed attacker is on the loose but after faking a hit nobody actually believes Light has been pied. Finally, Finlay's ghost convinces Light to attempt a heroic turn during a mission where multiple members of the team, some unwillingly, have traveled to Apokolips. Light is swiftly shot dead by Parademons. Light is sent to Hell, where he is physically reunited with Finlay. Under the watch of a lesser demon and its annoying assistant, both men are released from Hell in turns and returned to life. Both only soon die again: Arthur Light suffocates while still inside his grave, while the desiccated Finlay claws his way out of his own grave but is killed by a family of religious vigilantes. Arthur Light is again returned to life, and barely survives a fall that his demonic tormentors may have intended to be fatal. Arthur also possesses the body of the female Doctor Light, Kimiyo Hoshi. With the aide of her teacher, Kimiyo rejects Arthur's presence. Doctor Light, freed of his ex-partner's hauntings, attempts to rejoin the Suicide Squad, but his appeal is summarily rejected by Amanda Waller. He later becomes trapped in a Green Lantern power battery which would eventually come under the possession of Kyle Rayner, and as a consequence is temporarily transformed into living light. He later joins a short-lived incarnation of the Injustice Gang, in which he assists Lex Luthor in building holographic duplicates of the JLA. Identity Crisis onwards The 2004 miniseries Identity Crisis retroactively reveals that Doctor Light had raped Sue Dibny, the wife of the superhero Elongated Man, on the JLA Satellite. Later issues reveal that he was a serial rapist. The Justice League resolve to alter his mind with Zatanna's magic so that Light will no longer pose a threat to their loved ones. In the process, they accidentally give him a partial lobotomy, thus explaining how he fell from a plausible foe of the Justice League to a punching bag for the Teen Titans or Little Boy Blue. He later recovers his memories and intellect when witnessing a fight between the League members responsible for his mind-wipe and Deathstroke, and vowed revenge against the Justice League. Doctor Light captures Green Arrow, using him as bait so he could get revenge on the Teen Titans. The entire Teen Titans roster, former and current, responds to the call, but he brutally defeats them. After a mass battle against the Titans wears him down, Cyborg uses a device to drain the light out of the area, rendering Light powerless. Batman and Batgirl appear to take him to prison, but reveal themselves to be Deathstroke and Ravager in disguise, and offer Light a place in the new Secret Society of Super Villains. Doctor Light, hungry for vengeance and power, readily accepts.Teen Titans Vol.3 #21-23 As a Society member, he aids Merlyn and Deathstroke in defeating Green Arrow in Star City. Doctor Light then attacks and absorbs a great deal of power from Kimiyo Hoshi.Green Arrow #54 He later participates in the Battle of Metropolis in Infinite Crisis #7, where he is defeated by the combined efforts of the Ray, Black Canary, Martian Manhunter, and Kimiyo. In the Justice League of America Wedding Special, Light is a member of the Injustice League Unlimited. During a battle with the Justice League, fellow Injustice Leaguer Cheetah betrays him and slashes him in the back because of her hatred of rapists.Justice League of America vol. 2, #15 (December 2007) The entire Injustice League is captured and deported to an alien world by the Suicide Squad; Doctor Light is consequently one of the villains featured in Salvation Run. After returning to Earth, in DC Universe #0, Doctor Light is a member of Libra's Secret Society of Super Villains. In Final Crisis #1, he and Mirror Master are sent by Libra to recover Metron's chair. They are briefly challenged by Empress, Sparx, and M√°s y Menos, but defeat them by combining Light's beams with Mirror Master's mirrors. Light also aids the Human Flame and Libra in the murder of the Martian Manhunter. In Final Crisis: Revelations #1, the Spectre delivers final judgment on Doctor Light (who is discovered in the middle of a mock superhero rape orgy with various women dressed as Teen Titans), and burns him to death by turning him into a candle, using his head as the wick. The Milestone Comics group known as the Shadow Cabinet attempt to steal the remains of Light, still in the form of a candle.Justice League of America vol. 2, #27 (November 2008) In actuality, Superman and Icon set this scenario up to familiarize the Shadow Cabinet with the JLA. The candle is, however, used by Hardware to restore to Kimiyo Hoshi the remaining powers Arthur stole from her.Justice League of America vol. 2, #28 (December 2008)Justice League of America vol. 2, #30 (February 2009) Doctor Light is entombed below the Hall of Justice.Blackest Night #1 (July 2009) His corpse is revived as a Black Lantern.Blackest Night #3 (September 2009) He devours the remains of Gehenna's corpse, and attacks Kimiyo Hoshi.Justice League of America vol. 2, #39 (November 2009) Arthur employs psychology to make Kimiyo doubt herself. Just as he is on the verge of victory, he threatens Kimiyo's children, enraging her to the point where she produces a light which incinerates Arthur and his ring.Justice League of America vol. 2, #40 (December 2009) The New 52 In The New 52 (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics Universe), Arthur Light is a scientist working with A.R.G.U.S. and the Justice League of America. As he is studying a communicator used by the Secret Society of Super Villains, he receives a \\"nasty call\\" and is engulfed in an explosion of light leaving his body glowing on the floor.Justice League of America vol. 3 #4 Director Amanda Waller finds him transformed.Justice League of America vol. 3 #5 During the \\"Trinity War\\" storyline, Doctor Light is a reluctant member of the new Justice League of America, and expresses disgust over being made to harm Ronnie Raymond and Jason Rusch. During his first mission with the team, he is seemingly killed by Superman.Justice League vol. 2, #22 (July 2013) The Phantom Stranger takes Batman, Katana, and Deadman to the afterlife to locate Doctor Light. However, he doesn't remember anything about his death. The Phantom Stranger tells Doctor Light that he will try to free him from the afterlife, so he can be with his family. Doctor Light gives a piece of his soul to the Phantom Stranger in hopes that he can give it to his family as a final gift if he doesn't get out.Trinity of Sin: Phantom Stranger #11 It is later revealed that Atomica, who is from the alternate universe of Earth-3, is responsible for Doctor Light's death.Justice League vol. 2 #23 Doctor Light's body unleashes energy that destroys Washington, D.C.'s A.R.G.U.S. headquarters and exposes the A.R.G.U.S. Agents to it.

Dr. Light heads to Steve Trevor's location and states he must kill him in order for him to live.Forever Evil: A.R.G.U.S. #5 Killer Frost faces off against Doctor Light. Doctor Light hurls her into Steve's ice-block, freeing him. While Killer Frost holds Light back, Steve sneaks up behind him and wraps the Lasso of Truth around him. Compelled by its power, Doctor Light explains that he died and woke up confused. He was told what to do and where Steve would be. The Crimson Men had told him the truth that Arthur Light is dead. Horrified by his own self-realization, Doctor Light disappears in a blast of light energy.Forever Evil: A.R.G.U.S. #6 Doctor Light later resurfaces, now sporting his classic appearance. He states that his human body is still dead, and that he now merely exists as a construct of living light energy. It is also implied that he used to be a villain prior to his brief stint as a member of the Justice League, indicating his backstory has been retconned to some degree. Having been cut off from his wife and daughters, Arthur has fled to the country of Chetland, where he is given asylum in exchange for his services. After a conversation with Deathstroke, Arthur contemplates the possibility of returning to a life of villainy.Deathstroke (vol. 4) #22 Powers and abilities Doctor Light can control light for a variety of purposes. He can bend the light around him to become invisible, generate blasts of energy, create force fields, and fly. By mentally repulsing photons, Light can create areas of complete darkness. Teen Titans #23 implied that Light could \\"power up\\" by draining the ambient light in the area. The limits of his powers are unclear, but he seems to be able to wrest control of anything that emits light. Such things have included Green Lantern constructs, Superboy's heat vision, and magic lightning from Wonder Girl's lasso. He is also able to take the \\"internal\\" light away from light powered characters, the heroic Doctor Light and the Ray, leaving them temporarily powerless. He also has the ability to create holographic images. Despite his frequent defeats, he is quite powerful. Originally, Doctor Light derives his powers from his suit, but over time he internalizes this ability, and could use his powers without having to use his costume. Arthur Light is mentally brilliant, a genius in the field of physics. However, his mind-wipe by the Justice League reduces his intelligence substantially, along with his skills for creative use of his powers. Light's recovery of his memories seems to have brought his intellect back with them and also his paraphilia. As a result, he becomes a much deadlier opponent.

In the episode \\"Aqualad\\", a flashback shows the original Titans line-up apprehending Doctor Light. =Animation= Doctor Light's first armor * Doctor Light is a fairly minor villain in the Teen Titans animated series, voiced by Rodger Bumpass. His character mostly draws from the less-competent version in the comics, though he does prove to be a formidable opponent. He is generally portrayed as more of a nuisance than a real threat, though he has his moments, and his frequent short appearances and easy defeats are something of a running gag. Doctor Light first appears in the season one episode \\"Nevermore\\", where he proves to be a fairly dangerous opponent. He wears a simple, form-fitting suit which can fire energy blasts and create shields. Though he succeeds in defeating four of the five Titans, he angers Raven while attacking her. In her rage, she loses control of her powers and drags him into the darkness within her cloak. This attack leaves him severely traumatized and makes him afraid of Raven. His second major appearance is in \\"Birthmark\\". His suit is larger and more powerful, adding a light whip to his arsenal; he appears on an oil rig which he plans to steal the energy from, but was stopped by the Teen Titans who pointed out that they could see him on the rig from the living room of their tower. His fear of Raven prevented a drawn- out battle, with him asking to be taken to prison rather than having to fight her again. In the fifth season Doctor Light is one of the few villains that does not join the Brotherhood of Evil. In \\"Kole\\", he tries to harness the power of the Aurora Borealis with a special crystal, only to fail when the Titans intervene and destroy it. Both he and the Titans fall through the ice into an underground prehistoric land. There, he kidnaps Kole to replace his broken crystal, which makes him virtually unstoppable. Gnarrk removes Kole from the machine, allowing Kole to defeat Doctor Light by focusing Starfire's starbolts into a powerful laser. In \\"Titans Together\\", he attempts to rob a bank while the heroes and villains were occupied. All thirty Titans, having dispatched the Brotherhood, ready themselves to take him down, to which Raven remarks, that \\"he's totally gonna freak this time\\". Teen Titans Go! * Doctor Light appears in Teen Titans Go!, voiced by Scott Menville in \\"Colors of Raven\\" and reprised by Rodger Bumpass in \\"Caged Tiger\\". In \\"Staff Meeting\\", Robin tries to fight Doctor Light with his bent bo staff (which was bent by the other Teen Titans). Doctor Light's most major role in the series is in the episode \\"Caged Tiger\\" where Raven and Starfire come to battle him while Robin, Cyborg and Beast Boy are stuck in an elevator. Doctor Light insists that they wait for the other Titans to arrive as he had specifically built a machine to destroy all the Titans at once. While the boys try to get out of the elevator, Raven and Starfire enjoy their time with Doctor Light as he tells them about how he got the nickname \\"Doctor Light\\" and how his real name is Arthur. He eventually decides to quit being a supervillain and join the Teen Titans, but Robin, Cyborg, and Beast Boy arrive at the scene and beat him up, much to Starfire and Raven's disapproval. In \\"I See You\\", Doctor Light was shown to be constructing chandeliers which are actually laser weapons. Doctor Light's plot was defeated by Robin and Starfire during their stakeout.

The online banking system will typically connect to or be part of the core banking system operated by a bank and is in contrast to branch banking which was the traditional way customers accessed banking services. Some banks operate as a \\"direct bank\\" (or ‚Äúvirtual bank‚Äù), where they rely completely on internet banking. Internet banking software provides personal and corporate banking services offering features such as viewing account balances, obtaining statements, checking recent transactions, transferring money between accounts, and making payments. History Precursors The precursor to the modern home banking services were the distance banking services over electronic media from the early 1980s. The term 'online' became popular in the late 1980s and referred to the use of a terminal, keyboard, and TV (or monitor) to access the banking system using a phone line. 'Home banking' can also refer to the use of a numeric keypad to send tones down a phone line with instructions to the bank.  Emergence of computer banking  The first known deployment of home computer banking to consumers came in December 1980 at United American Bank, a community bank headquartered in Knoxville, Tenn. United American partnered with Radio Shack to produce a secure custom modem for its TRS-80 computer that would allow bank customers to access account information securely. Services available in its first year included bill pay, account balance checks, and loan applications, as well as game access, budget and tax calculators and daily newspapers. Thousands of customers paid $25‚Äì30 per month for the service. Large banks, many working on parallel tracks to United American, followed in 1981 when four of New York's major banks (Citibank, Chase Manhattan, Chemical, and Manufacturers Hanover) offered home banking services,Cronin, Mary J. (1997). Banking and Finance on the Internet, John Wiley and Sons. page 41 from using the videotex system. Because of the commercial failure of videotex, these banking services never became popular except in France (where the use of videotex (Minitel) was subsidized by the telecom provider) and the UK, where the Prestel system was used. The developers of United American Bank's first- to-market computer banking system aimed to license it nationally, but they were overtaken by competitors when United American failed in 1983 as a result of loan fraud on the part of bank owner Jake Butcher, the 1978 Tennessee Democratic nominee for governor and promoter of the 1982 Knoxville World's Fair. First Tennessee Bank, which purchased the failed bank, did not attempt to develop or commercialize the computer banking platform. Internet and customer reluctance When the clicks-and-bricks euphoria hit in the late 1990s, many banks began to view web-based banking as a strategic imperative. In 1996 OP Financial Group, also a cooperative bank, became the second online bank in the world and the first in Europe. The attraction of banks to online banking are fairly obvious: diminished transaction costs, easier integration of services, interactive marketing capabilities, and other benefits that boost customer lists and profit margins. Additionally, online banking services allow institutions to bundle more services into single packages, thereby luring customers and minimizing overhead. A mergers-and-acquisitions wave swept the financial industries in the mid- and late 1990s, greatly expanding bank's customer bases. Following this, banks looked to the Web as a way of maintaining their customers and building loyalty. A number of different factors are causing bankers to shift more of their business to the virtual realm. While financial institutions took steps to implement e-banking services in the mid-1990s, many consumers were hesitant to conduct monetary transactions over the internet. It took widespread adoption of electronic commerce, based on trailblazing companies such as America Online, Amazon.com and eBay, to make the idea of paying for items online widespread. By 2000, 80% of U.S. banks offered e-banking. Customer use grew slowly. At Bank of America, for example, it took 10 years to acquire 2 million e-banking customers. However, a significant cultural change took place after the Y2K scare ended. In 2001, Bank of America became the first bank to top 3 million online banking customers, more than 20% of its customer base. In comparison, larger national institutions, such as Citigroup claimed 2.2 million online relationships globally, while J.P. Morgan Chase estimated it had more than 750,000 online banking customers. Wells Fargo had 2.5 million online banking customers, including small businesses. Online customers proved more loyal and profitable than regular customers. In October 2001, Bank of America customers executed a record 3.1 million electronic bill payments, totaling more than $1 billion. As of 2017, the bank has 34 million active digital accounts, both online and mobile. In 2009, a report by Gartner Group estimated that 47% of United States adults and 30% in the United Kingdom bank online. The early 2000s saw the rise of the branch-less banks as internet only institutions. These internet-based banks incur lower overhead costs than their brick-and-mortar counterparts. In the United States, deposits at most direct banks are FDIC-insured and offer the same level of insurance protection as traditional banks. First online banking services by region =The United Kingdom= Online banking started in the United Kingdom with the launch of Nottingham Building Society (NBS)'s Homelink service in September 1982, initially on a restricted basis, before it was expanded nationally in 1983. Homelink was delivered through a partnership with the Bank of Scotland and British Telecom's Prestel service. The system used Prestel viewlink system and a computer, such as the BBC Micro, or keyboard (Tandata Td1400) connected to the telephone system and television set. The system allowed users to \\"transfer money between accounts, pay bills and arrange loans... compare prices and order goods from a few major retailers, check local restaurant menus or real estate listings, arrange vacations... enter bids in Homelink's regular auctions and send electronic mail to other Homelink users.\\" In order to make bank transfers and bill payments, a written instruction giving details of the intended recipient had to be sent to the NBS who set the details up on the Homelink system. Typical recipients were gas, electricity and telephone companies and accounts with other banks. Details of payments to be made were input into the NBS system by the account holder via Prestel. A cheque was then sent by NBS to the payee and an advice giving details of the payment was sent to the account holder. BACS was later used to transfer the payment directly. =The United States= In the United States in-home banking was \\"is still in its infancy\\" with banks \\"cautiously testing consumer interest\\" in 1984, a year after online banking went national in the UK. At the time Chemical Bank in New York was \\"still working out the bugs from its service, which offers somewhat limited features\\". The service from Chemical, called Pronto, was launched in 1983 and was aimed at individuals and small businesses. It enabled them to maintain electronic checkbook registers, see account balances, and transfer funds between checking and savings accounts. The other three major banks ‚Äî Citibank, Chase Bank and Manufacturers Hanover ‚Äî started to offer home banking services soon after. Chemical's Pronto failed to attract enough customers to break even and was abandoned in 1989. Other banks had a similar experience. Since it first appeared in the United States, online banking has been federally governed by the Electronic Funds Transfer Act of 1978.\\"Electronic Funds Transfer Act of 1978\\" =France= After a test period with 2,500 users starting in 1984, online banking services were launched in 1988, using Minitel terminals that were distributed freely to the population by the government. By 1990, 6.5 million Minitels were installed in households. Online banking was one of the most popular services. Online banking services later migrated to Internet. = Japan = In January 1997, the first online banking service was launched by Sumitomo Bank. By 2010, most major banks implemented online banking services, however, the types of services offered varied. According to a poll conducted by Japanese Bankers Association (JBA) in 2012, 65.2% were the users of personal internet banking. = China = In January 2015, WeBank, the online bank created by Tencent, started 4-month-long online banking trail operation. = Australia = In December 1995, Advance Bank acquired by St.George Bank, started to provide customers with online banking with the rollout of the C++ Internet banking program. = India = In 1998, ICICI Bank introduced internet banking to its customers. = Brazil = In 1996, Banco Original SA launched its online-only retail banking. In 2019 new banks began to emerge as the Conta Simples, focused only for companies. = Slovenia = Virtual or online banking became a reality in Slovenia in 1997, when SKB bank launched this service under the name of SKB Net. Two years later, they were followed by the largest Slovenian bank, NLB bank, who started offering online banking services in 1999 under the name of NLB Klik. Nowadays, actually every bank in Slovenia is offering online banking services. The Slovenian Central bank's data shows that there was a rise of 5,1% in 2017 from the previous year and the number almost doubled from more than ten years ago. At the end of 2019, the number of users was almost 1 million. The number of payments is around 26 million per quarter, which means that there are more than 100 million payments made online in Slovenia every year, and another 3 million made to offshore accounts. Data from the Slovenian Central bank also show that the total value of payments in 2017 reached more than ‚Ç¨240 million.

By the early 2000s, all of the major banks in Canada rolled out some form of online banking. = Ukraine = Remote customer service of banks via the internet or Online banking (e-banking) in Ukraine was introduced more than two decades ago. Legal entities have been using the remote control of bank accounts since the mid-1990s. PrivatBank, which launched the ‚ÄúPrivat24‚Äù system in 2000, became a pioneer in retail online banking.https://maanimo.com/ua/internet-banking Since 2000, most financial institutions have been actively implementing online offices and web banking. 2007 - the number of Ukrainian banks that introduced Online Banking exceeded 20. 2018 - the ability to manage accounts and make transfers online is available in almost all financial institutions in Ukraine. Nowadays, the list of Internet banking services, with rare exceptions, repeats the entire product line of banks. With the help of Internet banking (IB), you can not only control the movement of funds in their accounts, but also perform more complex operations: for example, order a payment card or open a deposit account, repay the loan, and recently it became possible to buy and sell currency.https://marketer.ua/ua/the-best-innovative-banks-of-ukraine/ The rapid development of Internet banking in Ukraine is provoking the growth of Internet users. It is important to mention that the largest functionality, more than 40 options - from transfers and opening deposits to home accounting and purchasing tickets are available in PrivatBank. There are 37 options in the Internet banking system of the First Ukrainian International Bank, 35 - in Alfa-Bank. One of the most popular services in which Internet banking users are interested in the ability to pay remotely for utilities.http://www.economyandsociety.in.ua/journal/13_ukr/206.pdf = North Macedonia = Compared to several years ago, when the people living in Macedonia had to go directly to the banks to perform financial transactions, today there is a widely functional e-banking system. Macedonian banks today offer conventional e-banking services, electronic products including debit/credit cards and e-trading and contemporary electronic services like internet banking and online investing. What is important when it comes to e-banking is the trust in banks, usability of the platforms and the overall marketing for e-banking from banks. Moreover, it's also important to constantly update the e-banking services. One successful example regarding the above-mentioned characteristics in Macedonia is ‚ÄúStopanska Banka‚Äù AD Skopje. In the country, several factors significantly influence the level of adoption and usage of e-banking services, such as age, level of education and complexity of the e-banking services offered by banks. Naturally, elderly clients use e-banking services less than younger people. In addition, the level of education has a significant influence on the level of usage, meaning that the higher the education level, the more likely is for the citizen to use e-banking services. As for the satisfaction, citizens are generally more satisfied with the e-banking services offered by various banks when they have a diverse portfolio of services and offer fast and simple completion of transactions.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325908154_An_empirical_study_of_customer_usage_and_satisfaction_with_e- banking_services_in_the_Republic_of_Macedonia Banks and the World Wide Web Around 1994, banks saw the rising popularity of the internet as an opportunity to advertise their services. Initially, they used the internet as another brochure, without interaction with the customer. Early sites featured pictures of the bank's officers or buildings, and provided customers with maps of branches and ATM locations, phone numbers to call for further information and simple listings of products. Interactive banking on the Web In 1995, Wells Fargo was the first U.S. bank to add account services to its website, with other banks quickly following suit. That same year, Presidential became the first U.S. bank to open bank accounts over the internet. According to research by Online Banking Report, at the end of 1999 less than 0.4% of households in the U.S. were using online banking. At the beginning of 2004, some 33 million U.S. households (31%) were using some form of online banking. Five years later, 47% of Americans used online banking, according to a survey by Gartner Group. Meanwhile, in the UK online banking grew from 63% to 70% of internet users between 2011 and 2012.Abdou, Hussein, English, John and Adewunmi, Paul An investigation of risk management practices in electronic banking: the case of the UK banks eprints.hud.ac.uk, University of Huddersfield, July 22, 2014 (PDF; 474 kB) By 2018, the number of digital banking users in the U.S. reached approximately 61 percent. The penetration of online banking in Europe has been increased as well. In 2019, a date shows that 93 percent of the Norwegian population access online banking sites, which is the highest in Europe, followed by Denmark and Netherlands. Across Asia, more than 700 million consumers are estimated to use digital banking regularly, according to a 2015 survey by McKinsey and Company. Operation To access a financial institution's online banking facility, a customer with internet access will need to register with the institution for the service, and set up a password and other credentials for customer verification. The credentials for online banking is normally not the same as for telephone or mobile banking. Financial institutions now routinely allocate customers numbers, whether or not customers have indicated an intention to access their online banking facility. Customer numbers are normally not the same as account numbers, because a number of customer accounts can be linked to the one customer number. Technically, the customer number can be linked to any account with the financial institution that the customer controls, though the financial institution may limit the range of accounts that may be accessed to, say, cheque, savings, loan, credit card and similar accounts. The customer visits the financial institution's secure website, and enters the online banking facility using the customer number and credentials previously set up. Each financial institution can determine the types of financial transactions which a customer may transact through online banking, but usually includes obtaining account balances, a list of recent transactions, electronic bill payments, financing loans and funds transfers between a customer's or another's accounts. Most banks set limits on the amounts that may be transacted, and other restrictions. Most banks also enable customers to download copies of bank statements, which can be printed at the customer's premises (some banks charge a fee for mailing hard copies of bank statements). Some banks also enable customers to download transactions directly into the customer's accounting software. The facility may also enable the customer to order a cheque book, statements, report loss of credit cards, stop payment on a cheque, advise change of address and other routine actions. Features Online banking facilities typically have many features and capabilities in common, but also have some that are application specific. The common features fall broadly into several categories: * A bank customer can perform non- transactional tasks through online banking, including: ** Viewing account balances ** Viewing recent transactions ** Downloading bank statements, for example in PDF format ** Viewing images of paid cheques ** Ordering cheque books ** Download periodic account statements ** Downloading applications for M-banking, E-banking etc. * Bank customers can transact banking tasks through online banking, including: ** Funds transfers between the customer's linked accounts ** Paying third parties, including bill payments (see, e.g., BPAY) and third party fund transfers (see, e.g., FAST) ** Investment purchase or sale ** Loan applications and transactions, such as repayments of enrollments ** Credit card applications ** Register utility billers and make bill payments * Financial institution administration * Management of multiple users having varying levels of authority * Transaction approval process Some financial institutions offer special internet banking services, for example: * Personal financial management support, such as importing data into personal accounting software. Some online banking platforms support account aggregation to allow the customers to monitor all of their accounts in one place whether they are with their main bank or with other institutions. Security Five security token devices for online banking Security of a customer's financial information is very important, without which online banking could not operate. Similarly the reputational risks to banks themselves are important. Financial institutions have set up various security processes to reduce the risk of unauthorized online access to a customer's records, but there is no consistency to the various approaches adopted. The use of a secure website has been almost universally embraced. Though single password authentication is still in use, it by itself is not considered secure enough for online banking in some countries. Basically there are two different security methods in use for online banking: * The PIN/TAN system where the PIN represents a password, used for the login and TANs representing one-time passwords to authenticate transactions. TANs can be distributed in different ways, the most popular one is to send a list of TANs to the online banking user by postal letter. Another way of using TANs is to generate them by need using a security token. These token generated TANs depend on the time and a unique secret, stored in the security token (two-factor authentication or 2FA). :More advanced TAN generators (chipTAN) also include the transaction data into the TAN generation process after displaying it on their own screen to allow the user to discover man-in-the-middle attacks carried out by Trojans trying to secretly manipulate the transaction data in the background of the PC.chipTAN (Sicherungsverfahren im Online-Banking) sparkasse-koelnbonn.de, Sparkasse K√∂lnBonn (A√∂R), Retrieved on April 10, 2014. :Another way to provide TANs to an online banking user is to send the TAN of the current bank transaction to the user's (GSM) mobile phone via SMS. The SMS text usually quotes the transaction amount and details, the TAN is only valid for a short period of time. Especially in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands many banks have adopted this \\"SMS TAN\\" service. There is also \\"PhotoTAN\\" service, where the bank generates and sends a QR code image to a smartphone device of the online banking user. :Usually online banking with PIN/TAN is done via a web browser using SSL secured connections, so that there is no additional encryption needed. * Signature based online banking where all transactions are signed and encrypted digitally. The Keys for the signature generation and encryption can be stored on smartcards or any memory medium, depending on the concrete implementation (see, e.g., the Spanish ID card DNI electr√≥nicoDNI electr√≥nico de Espa√±a/Spanish ID-card). Attacks Attacks on online banking used today are based on deceiving the user to steal login data and valid TANs. Two well known examples for those attacks are phishing and pharming. Cross-site scripting and keylogger/Trojan horses can also be used to steal login information. A method to attack signature based online banking methods is to manipulate the used software in a way, that correct transactions are shown on the screen and faked transactions are signed in the background. A 2008 U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Technology Incident Report, compiled from suspicious activity reports banks file quarterly, lists 536 cases of computer intrusion, with an average loss per incident of $30,000. That adds up to a nearly $16-million loss in the second quarter of 2007. Computer intrusions increased by 150 percent between the first quarter of 2007 and the second. In 80 percent of the cases, the source of the intrusion is unknown but it occurred during online banking, the report states.Security Flaws in Online Banking Sites Found to be Widespread Newswise, Retrieved on July 23, 2008. In the UK, losses from online banking fraud rose by 48% in 2014 compared with 2013. According to a study by a group of Cambridge University cybersecurity researchers in 2017, online banking fraud has doubled since 2011. Another kind of attack is the so-called man-in-the-browser attack, a variation of the man-in-the-middle attack where a Trojan horse permits a remote attacker to secretly modify the destination account number and also the amount in the web browser. As a reaction to advanced security processes allowing the user to cross-check the transaction data on a secure device there are also combined attacks using malware and social engineering to persuade the user himself to transfer money to the fraudsters on the ground of false claims (like the claim the bank would require a \\"test transfer\\" or the claim a company had falsely transferred money to the user's account and he should \\"send it back\\").Tatanga Attack Exposes chipTAN Weaknesses trusteer.com, September 4, 2012Trojaner gaukelt Fehl√ºberweisung vor Heise Security, June 1, 2013 Users should therefore never perform bank transfers they have not initiated themselves.

In 2001, the U.S. Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council issued guidance for multifactor authentication (MFA) and then required to be in place by the end of 2006. In 2012, the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security advised all banks to consider the PC systems of their users being infected by malware by default and therefore use security processes where the user can cross-check the transaction data against manipulations like for example (provided the security of the mobile phone holds up) SMS TAN where the transaction data is sent along with the TAN number or standalone smartcard readers with an own screen including the transaction data into the TAN generation process while displaying it beforehand to the user (see chipTAN) to counter man-in-the- middle attacks.‚ÄúHigh Roller‚Äù online bank robberies reveal security gaps European Union Agency for Network and Information Security, July 5, 2012 See also *Contactless payment *Current account *Direct bank *Digital currency *Enhanced Telephone (Citibank product circa 1990) *Free and open source software *Guide to E-payments *Mobile banking *On-line and off-line *Open banking *SMS banking *Single sign-on *Telephone banking References External links * Gandy, T.

Evolution of the party The declaration reflected the evolution of the party from socialism to a more moderate form of social democracy and Keynesian economics since its founding during the Great Depression. It also reflected the increased pragmatism that coloured the party since taking power in the province of Saskatchewan. The anti-communist mood of the Cold War also caused the CCF to seek to moderate its stance. CCF federal vice-president and future New Democratic Party leader David Lewis was instrumental in drafting the document and having it approved. From nationalization to mixed economy Where the Regina Manifesto called for a socialist economy in which major sectors of the economy would be nationalized and placed under public control, the Winnipeg Declaration called for a mixed economy in which \\"there will be an important role for public, private and co-operative enterprise working together in the people's interest\\". The declaration also moderated earlier demands for a planned economy and where the Regina Manifesto declared that the CCF would not rest until capitalism was \\"eradicated\\" the 1956 declaration affirmed that \\"The CCF will not rest content until every person in this land and in all other lands is able to enjoy equality and freedom, a sense of human dignity, and an opportunity to live a rich and meaningful life as a citizen of a free and peaceful world.\\" Statement of principles The Winnipeg Declaration remained the basic statement of party principles of the CCF and its successor, the New Democratic Party, until 1983 when it was replaced by the Statement of Principles.

(1919). Oregon: Her History, Her Great Men, Her Literature. The J.K. Gill Co.: Portland. p. 398.) is a former town in the U.S. state of Oregon. Now a ghost town, it was an important settlement in the Willamette Valley in the early 1840s. Located halfway between Oregon City and Salem, it was the site of the first provisional government of the Oregon Country. The town site is on the south bank of the Willamette River in northern Marion County, approximately 5 mi (8 km) southeast of Newberg. The town is now part of Champoeg State Heritage Area, an Oregon state park. The Champoeg State Park Historic Archeological District is within the heritage area. The name \\"Champoeg\\" comes from the Kalapuyan word [ƒç ∞√°mpuik], which might be an abbreviation of [ƒç ∞a-ƒç ∞√≠ma-p√∫iƒçuk], referring to the edible root [p√∫iƒçuk], or yampa. History Champoeg is best known as the site of a series of meetings held in the town during the 1840s. On February 7, 1841, Willamette Valley settlers convened there for the first time. They selected Oregon missionary Jason Lee as their chairman and considered measures to deal with problem of wolves menacing their settlements. It was to be the first in a series of \\"Wolf Meetings\\" at the town site that would establish the basis of civil codes. By the middle 1840s, the question of the possession of the disputed Oregon Country between the United States and the United Kingdom began to loom large. On May 2, 1843, a meeting was held at the town to determine whether a provisional government should be established. The measure passed by 52 to 50. A group of nine representatives was named to create a provisional government with Champoeg as its capital. A petition to the United States Congress was drafted and sent to Washington, D.C. with William Gilpin, who had helped draft the petition and came to the Willamette Valley with the expedition of John C. Fr√©mont. On his journey eastward to deliver the petition, Gilpin evangelized for the settlement of the Pacific Northwest, helping to spread \\"Oregon fever\\". He presented the petition to Congress in 1845. The question of possession of the Oregon Country was settled the following year in the 1846 Oregon Treaty. When the Oregon Territory was organized in 1848, however, Champoeg was not chosen as the capital. Around 1852 the town had grown to include a ferry across the Willamette, a warehouse owned by Francis Pettygrove and Alanson Beers, a steamboat landing, a granary owned by the Hudson's Bay Company, and a stagecoach office.Chapman, J. S. (1993). French prairie ceramics: the Harriet D. Munnick archaeological collection, circa 1820‚Äì1860: a catalog and Northwest comparative guide. Anthropology northwest, no. 8.

Champoeg was also the crossroads of the Champoeg- St. Paul Road, Champoeg-Salem Road, Champoeg-Oregon City Road, and the Champoeg-DeGuire's Ferry Road. Most of the town was located on the Donation Land Claims of Robert Newell and Andr√© Longtain. The 1901 monument in Champoeg marking the spot where the first American government on the Pacific Coast was organized. A stake marks the former location of a street corner in Champoeg. The town continued to exist after Oregon statehood. However, on December 2, 1861, the adjacent Willamette River rose 55 feet (17 m) above its normal summer stage, flooding the town with seven feet (2 m) of water. The great flood destroyed most of the structures in the town, barring two saloons. Panicked residents found shelter at the Newell House, which was built upon a hill. Robert Newell went nearly bankrupt in caring for the flood victims. Champoeg was never rebuilt after the disaster. The town site is now preserved as Champoeg State Heritage Area. A 1901 monument records the names of the 52 settlers who voted to establish the provisional government at the 1843 meeting. Dams installed since the 1930s make another catastrophic flood unlikely. Champoeg State Heritage Area Amenities of the heritage area include a visitor center, an 1860s-style garden, the Newell House Museum ‚Äì Robert Newell's restored 1852 house ‚Äì and the Pioneer Mothers Memorial Cabin Museum. Also located in the park is the Historic Butteville Store, which was founded in 1863. Considered the oldest operating store in Oregon, it is the last remaining commercial building of the nearby community of Butteville. A series of weekend interpretive programs is available late June through Labor Day weekend, and the Champoeg Promise program provides an interactive living history program for schoolchildren. The site is open year-round and is available for camping (tent, yurt, cabin and RV), hiking, disc golf, bicycling, bird watching, picnicking, fishing and boating. Archeological sites The Champoeg State Heritage Area is the site of the Champoeg State Park Historic Archeological District, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. One of the important archeological finds at the site is the only mostly intact early homesite found so far on French Prairie. The evidence suggests that this was Robert Newell's first homesite.

Indeed, much of the architectural influence on the Romans came from the Greeks, and theatre structural design was no different from other buildings. However, Roman theatres have specific differences, such as generally being built upon their own foundations instead of earthen works or a hillside and being completely enclosed on all sides. Buildings Standard floor plan of a Roman theatre Roman theatres were built in all areas of the Empire, from Spain to the Middle East. Because of the Romans' ability to influence local architecture, we see numerous theatres around the world with uniquely Roman attributes. Similarities exist between the theatres and amphitheaters of ancient Rome. They were constructed out of the same material, Roman concrete, and provided a place for the public to go and see numerous events. However, they are two entirely different structures, with specific layouts that lend to the different events they held. Amphitheatres did not need superior acoustics, unlike those provided by the structure of a Roman theatre. While amphitheatres would feature races and gladiatorial events, theatres hosted events such as plays, pantomimes, choral events, orations, and commerce. Their design, with its semicircular form, enhances the natural acoustics, unlike Roman amphitheatres constructed in the round. Interior view of the Roman theatre of Bosra, Syria: 1) Scaenae frons 2) Porticus post scaenam 3) Pulpitum 4) Proscaenium 5) Orchestra 6) Cavea 7) Aditus maximus 8) Vomitorium. These buildings were semi-circular and possessed certain inherent architectural structures, with minor differences depending on the region in which they were constructed. The scaenae frons was a high back wall of the stage floor, supported by columns. The proscaenium was a wall that supported the front edge of the stage with ornately decorated niches off to the sides. The Hellenistic influence is seen through the use of the proscenium. The Roman theatre also had a podium, which sometimes supported the columns of the scaenae frons. The theatre itself was divided into the stage (orchestra) and the seating section (cavea). The cavea was sometimes constructed on a small hill or slope in which stacked seating could be easily made in the tradition of the Greek theatres. The center of the cavea was hollowed out of a hill or slope, while the outer radian seats required structural support and solid retaining walls. This was not always the case as Romans tended to build their theatres regardless of the availability of hillsides. All theatres built within the city of Rome were completely man-made without the use of earthworks. The cavea was not roofed, rather, awnings (vela) could be pulled overhead to provide shelter from rain or sunlight.Richard Allan Tomlinson. \\"Theatres (Greek and Roman), structure\\", The Oxford Companion to Classical Civilization. Ed. Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth. Oxford University Press, 1998. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. Northwestern University. 11 May 2007. Vomitoria, passages situated below or behind a tier of seats, were made available to the audience. Some Roman theatres, constructed of wood, were torn down after the festival for which they were erected concluded. This practice was due to a moratorium on permanent theatre structures that lasted until 55 BC when the Theatre of Pompey was built with the addition of a temple to avoid the law. Some Roman theatres show signs of never having been completed in the first place., Constance Campbell. \\"The Uncompleted Theatres of Rome\\", The Johns Hopkins University Press. Theatre Journal 55.1 (2003) 67‚Äì79 10 May 2007. Inside Rome, few theatres have survived the centuries following their construction, providing little evidence about the specific theatres.

Etymology is an abbreviation of ('a cleavage of an evil spirit'), or ('dibbuk from the outside'), which is found in man. comes from the Hebrew word which means 'the act of sticking' and is a nominal form derived from the verb 'to adhere' or 'cling'.See A.

Ansky's play The Dybbuk popularised the concept in literary circles. Earlier accounts of possession (such as that given by Josephus) were of demonic possession rather than that by ghosts.Tree of Souls:The Mythology of Judaism, by Howard Schwartz, pp. 229‚Äì230, Oxford University Press, 1 Nov 2004 These accounts advocated orthodoxy among the populace as a preventative measure. For example, it was suggested that a sloppily made mezuzah or entertaining doubt about Moses' crossing of the Red Sea opened one's household to possession. Very precise details of names and locations have been included in accounts of possession. Rabbi Yoel Teitelbaum, the Satmar rebbe (1887‚Äì1979) is reported to have supposedly advised an individual said to be possessed to consult a psychiatrist. Ansky's play is a significant work of Yiddish theatre, and has been adapted a number of times by writers, composers and other creators including Jerome Robbins/Leonard Bernstein and Tony Kushner. In the play, a young bride is possessed by the ghost of the man she was meant to marry, had her father not broken a marriage agreement.

Mezh dvukh mirov [Dibuk]; , Tsvishn Tsvey Veltn ‚Äì der Dibuk) is a play by S. Ansky, authored between 1913 and 1916. It was originally written in Russian and later translated into Yiddish by Ansky himself. The Dybbuk had its world premiere in that language, performed by the Vilna Troupe at Warsaw in 1920. A Hebrew version was prepared by Hayim Nahman Bialik and staged in Moscow at Habima Theater in 1922. The play, which depicts the possession of a young woman by the malicious spirit ‚Äì known as Dybbuk in Jewish folklore ‚Äì of her dead beloved, became a canonical work of both Hebrew and Yiddish theatre, being further translated and performed around the world. Characters * Leah, daughter of Sender, a maiden who had come of age and yet her father constantly rejects her suitors * Khanan, a poor Yeshiva student enamored with Leah, who is rumored to practice forbidden Kabbalah * Sender, son of Henya, a rich merchant who resides in Brinitz, Leah's father. * The Messenger, a sinister, unnamed traveler. * Rabbi Azriel, son of Hadasa, a venerable hasidic Tzadik who resides in nearby Miropol, reputed to be a miracle-worker * Nisan, son of Karina, a scholar who knew Azriel * Rabbi Samson, Mara d'atra (chief rabbi) of Miropol. * Michael, Azriel's servant * Meyer, beadle in the Brinitz synagogue * Gittel and Besya, Leah's friends * Frieda, her old nurse * Menashe, Leah's new betrothed * Nakhman, his father * Asher and Hanoch, Yeshiva students and friends of Khanan * The two Dayannim, the religious judges presiding alongside Samson * Three idlers, who waste their time in the study hall * Azriel's hasidim, poor folk, crowd  Plot summary  Act I The play is set in the Jewish town (Shtetl) of Brinitz, presumably near Miropol, Volhynia, in the Pale of Settlement. No date is mentioned, but it takes place after the death of David of Talne, who is said to be \\"of blessed memory\\", in 1882. Three idlers lounge in the synagogue, telling stories of the famed hasidic Tzadikim and their mastery of Kabbalah powers. They are accompanied by the Messenger, a sinister stranger who demonstrates uncanny knowledge of the subject. Khanan, a dreamy, emaciated student, joins them. Upon seeing him, the three gossip of his reputed dealing with the secret lore. They discuss Leah, the daughter of rich Sender, whose suitors are constantly faced with new demands from her father until they despair. Khanan, who is obviously in love with her, rejoices when one of the idlers tells another proposed match came to nothing. Then Sender himself enters, announcing that he wavered but eventually closed the deal. The townspeople flock to congratulate him. Khanan is shocked, mumbling all his labors were in vain, but then something dawns on him and he is ecstatic. He falls to the floor. The townspeople are busy with Sender, but eventually notice Khanan and try to awake him. They discover he is dead, and that he clasped the Book of Raziel. Act II Several months later, Leah's wedding day has arrived. As decreed by custom, a humble feast is held for the poor folk prior to the ceremony, and the maiden dances with the beggars. She and her nurse discuss the fate of the souls of those who died prematurely, mentioning Khanan who Leah says came to her in a dream. They visit the holy grave in the center of Brinitz, the resting place of a bride and a groom who were killed under their wedding canopy when the \\"Evil Chmiel\\" raided the area in 1648. She ceremoniously invites the souls of her mother and grandparents to her celebration. Menashe, her betrothed, arrives with his father. At the ceremony, he approaches to remove Leah's veil. She shoves him back, screaming in a man's voice. The Messenger, standing nearby, announces she is possessed by a Dybbuk. Act III In the home of the Tzadik Azriel of Miropol, the servant enters to announce that Sender's possessed daughter has arrived. Azriel confides to his assistant that he is old and weak, but the latter encourages him with tales of his father and grandfather, both renowned miracle-workers. He calls Leah and demands from the spirit to leave her body. The Dybbuk refuses. Azriel recognizes him as Khanan, and summons the rabbinical court to place an anathema upon him. Rabbi Samson arrives and recounts that the spirit of Nisan, a scholar who died and knew the Tzadik, came to him in a dream. He told that Khanan is his son and he sues Sender before the court, on the charge he is responsible for his death. The rabbis determine to hold the litigation on the day after, and exorcise the spirit only upon discovering the truth. Act IV Nisan's soul arrives at the court and communicates via Rabbi Samson. He tells the assembled that he and Sender were old friends, and swore that if one would father a son and the other a daughter, they will be married to each other. Nisan died prematurely, but his son Khanan arrived at Brinitz and his heart went after Leah, as was destined. He claims that Sender recognized him but did not want to have his daughter marry a poor man. Sender confides that he felt a strange urge to reject all suitors and take Khanan, but he eventually managed to resist it. Nisan pleads on, stating his desperate son turned to the Other Side and died, leaving him with none to say Kaddish after him. The court absolves Sender, stating that one cannot promise an object not yet created under the laws of the Torah, but fine him severely and oblige him to say Kaddish for Nisan and Khanan for all his life. Azriel commands the spirit to exit Leah's body, but it refuses. The holy man then conducts a dramatic exorcism, summoning various mystical entities and using ram horns' blasts and black candles. The Dybbuk is forced out. Menashe is invited, and a wedding is prepared. When Leah lies alone, she senses Khanan's spirit and confides she loved him ever since seeing him for the first time. Mourning her never-to-be children, she rises and walks towards him. The two are united in death.  Writing  Ansky interviewing two community elders in the Pale of Settlement, 1912. Between 1912 and 1913, S. Ansky headed an ethnographic commission, financed by Baron Vladimir G√ºnzburg and named in honor of his father Horace G√ºnzburg, which traveled through Podolia and Volhynia in the Pale of Settlement. They documented the oral traditions and customs of the native Jews, whose culture was slowly disintegrating under the pressure of modernity. According to his assistant Samuel Schreier-Shrira, Ansky was particularly impressed by the stories he heard in Miropol of a local sage, the hasidic rebbe Samuel of Kaminka-Miropol (1778 ‚Äì May 10, 1843), who was reputed to have been a master exorcist of dybbuk spirits. Samuel served as the prototype for the character Azriel, who is also said to reside in that town.Nathaniel Deutsch, The Jewish Dark Continent, Harvard University Press, 2009. p. 47-48. Historian Nathaniel Deutsch suggested he also drew inspiration from the Maiden of Ludmir, who was also rumored to have been possessed, thus explaining her perceived inappropriate manly behavior.Nathaniel Deutsch, The Maiden of Ludmir: A Jewish Holy Woman and Her World, University of California Press, 2003. p. 9, 15-16. Craig Stephen Cravens deduced that Ansky began writing the play in late 1913. It was first mentioned in a reply to him from Baron G√ºnzburg, on 12 February 1914, who commented he read a draft and found it compelling. The original was in Russian; shortly after completing it, the author was advised by friends to translate it into Yiddish. In the summer, he started promoting The Dybbuk, hoping it would be staged by a major Russian theater. He was rebuffed by Semyon Vengerov of the Alexandrinsky Theatre, who explained they could not perform another play by a Jew after the negative reaction to Semyon Yushkevich's Mendel Spivak. Ansky then contacted the managers of the Moscow Art Theatre. He failed to secure a meeting with Constantin Stanislavski himself, but director Leopold Sulerzhitsky read the play during the autumn, and replied much further work was required. Guided by him via correspondence, the author rewrote his piece through 1915. When he accepted the revised version in September, Sulerzhitsky regarded it as much better, but not satisfactory. At that time, Ansky's publisher Zinovy Grzhebin submitted it to the state censorship in St. Petersburg. Censor Nikolai von Osten-Driesen commented the banishment of the spirit resembled the Exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac, and Ansky rewrote the scene using subtler terms. This version was approved by Driesen on 10 October, after removing another minor reference to angels. The play was still undergoing modifications: on 21 October, Ansky propositioned to Sulerzhitsky they add a prologue, epilogue and a long scene of Leah's wedding day. He agreed, and the censor approved the expanded edition on 30 November. Both copies submitted by Ansky were found in 2001 at the Russian Academy of Theatre Arts. They were considerably different from the known stage version: most notably, the Messenger was not yet conceived. Stanislavski agreed to review the play, though not thoroughly, on 30 December. Though many accounts link him with The Dybbuk, Cravens commented this is the only actual documentation in the matter. He never even watched The Dybbuk fully. He and the rest of the management continued to request revisions. On 25 November 1916, Ansky wrote in his diary that Stanislavski was almost pleased, asking but for only minor changes in the ending. On 8 January 1917, the press reported the Moscow Art Theatre accepted The Dybbuk and was preparing to stage it. At the very same time, Stanislavski was supporting the incipient Habima Theater, a Hebrew-language venture headed by Nachum Tzemach. Ansky read his play to Hillel Zlatopolsky, a patron of Habima, who purchased the rights to translate it to Hebrew. The author set but one condition, demanding it would be handed over to Hayim Nahman Bialik. The latter accepted the task in February and completed it in July. Bialik's translation was the first version of the play to be published: it was released in the Hebrew literary magazine Ha'tkufa in February 1918. Meanwhile, the Moscow Art Theatre's planned production of The Dybbuk encountered severe hardships. Michael Chekhov, cast as Azriel, had a severe nervous breakdown due to the use of extreme acting techniques; Stanislavski fell ill with typhus. On 7 March 1918, Boris Suskevich notified Ansky his play was not to be included in that season's repertoire. The author left the city to Vilnius, losing his original copy on the way, but eventually receiving another from Shmuel Niger. He read his renewed edition before David Herman, director of the Vilna Troupe, but did not live to see it performed. He died on November 8, 1920.Gabriella Safran, Steven Zipperstein (editors), The Worlds of S. An-sky: A Russian Jewish Intellectual at the Turn of the Century. Stanford University Press, 2006. pp. 362-403.  Stage productions  A Yiddish advertisement for the 1920 Warsaw production. On 9 December, at the end of the thirty days' mourning after Ansky's departure, Herman and his troupe staged the world premiere of The Dybbuk in Yiddish, at the Warsaw Elizeum Theater. Miriam Orleska, Alexander Stein, Abraham Morevsky and Noah Nachbusch portrayed Leah, Khanan, Azriel and the Messenger, respectively. The play turned into a massive success, drawing large audiences for over a year, from all the shades of society and a considerable number of Christians. A Yiddish columnist in Warsaw remarked that \\"of every five Jews in the city, a dozen watched The Dybbuk. How could this be? It is not a play you attend merely once.\\" In the Polish capital alone, they staged it over three hundred times. During their tour across Europe between 1922 and 1927, it remained the pinnacle of their repertoire. While most of their acts drew few visitors, The Dybbuk remained an audience magnet. On 1 September 1921, the play had its American premiere in the New York Yiddish Art Theatre of Maurice Schwartz. Celia Adler, Bar Galilee, Schwartz and Julius Adler appeared as Leah, Khanan, Azriel and the Messenger. It ran for several months. While Habima Theater accepted Bialik's translation much earlier, both the intricacy of the play and the production of others delayed its stagings. Director Yevgeny Vakhtangov planned it for years. He originally cast Shoshana Avivit (Lichtenstein), one of his young actresses, as Leah. Avivit was a notorious prima donna and an intimate friend of Bialik, and abandoned the theater unexpectedly on 21 March 1921, due to constant quarrels with the directors. She was confident that the management would call her back, but they dismissed her of the role of Leah, to Bialik's chagrin; he ceased attending rehearsals. Vakhtangov gave the piece to Hanna Rovina, to the dismay of his associates, who considered the thirty-year-old actress too mature for portraying an eighteen-year-old Leah. Rovina was recovering from Tuberculosis in a sanatorium north of Moscow, and left the establishment in spite of the doctors' protests. Leah became her signature role.Carmit Gai, ha-Malkah nas ªah be-o·π≠obus : Rovina ·πøe-\\"Habimah\\", Am Oved, 1995. . p. 72-73. The Hebrew- language premiere was staged on 9 December 1920, at Habima's residence in the Sekretariova Theater. Rovina, Miriam Elias (who was replaced by male actors in subsequent stagings), Shabtai Prudkin and Nachum Tzemach appeared in the four leading roles. Habima performed it precisely 300 times in the Soviet Union, 292 in Moscow; the last was on 18 January 1926, before it embarked on an international tour. In the British Mandate of Palestine, it premiered in a makeshift production organized by a labor battalion paving Highway 75; while the exact date was unrecorded, it was sometime in February 1922. Abba Hushi depicted Azriel. Professional stagings soon followed suit. On the 6th and 16 June 1926, in two consecutive meetings, the members of the Hebrew Writers Union in Tel Aviv conducted \\"the Dybbuk trial\\", a public debate attended by an audience of 5,000 people. They discussed the gap between the needs of the Zionist enterprise and the play's atmosphere, voicing concern that it might overshadow the \\"young Hebrew culture\\" developing in Palestine, struggling to free itself from the constraints of diaspora mentality. Eventually, they approved the play. The German-language premiere opened on 28 February 1925, in Vienna's Rolandb√ºhne, with Friedrich Feher as Azriel and Magda Sonja playing Leah. The first English production ran from 15 December 1925 and 1926 at the off-Broadway Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City. It was translated and adapted by Henry G. Alsberg and Winifred Katzin. On 31 January 1928, Gaston Baty's French-language version premiered in the Studio des Champs-√âlys√©es. In 1977, Joseph Chaikin, a central figure in American avant-garde theatre, directed a new translation of The Dybbuk by Mira Rafalowicz, a dramaturg, yiddishist and longtime collaborator of Chaikin's at The Public Theater. The Royal Shakespeare Company staged Rafalowicz' translation, directed by Katie Mitchell, in 1992. Leon Katz wrote multiple adaptations of The Dybbuk, Toy Show (1970) and Shekhina: The Bride (1971), both directed by Rina Yerushalmi and produced at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club. A two-person adaptation by Bruce Myers won him an Obie when he performed it in New York in 1979. The Jewish Theatre San Francisco, formerly Traveling Jewish Theatre also performed it, winning several awards.tjt-sf.org A new adaptation by Canadian playwright Anton Piatigorsky opened at Toronto's Soulpepper Theatre in May 2015.  Adaptations  Besides stories, Ansky also collected traditional melodies, one of which he incorporated into this play. When Aaron Copland attended a performance of the play in New York in 1929, he was struck by this melody and made it the basis of his piano trio Vitebsk, named for the town where Ansky was born.Aaron Copland and Vivian Perlis, Copland 1900 through 1942. In 1929 George Gershwin accepted a commission from the Metropolitan Opera to write an opera based on \\"The Dybbuk.\\" When he was unable to acquire the rights (assigned to the Italian composer Lodovico Rocca, whose opera, Il Dibuk, was written on a libretto by Renato Simoni), he instead began work on his opera \\"Porgy and Bess\\". The play has been adapted into the 1937 film The Dybbuk, directed by Micha≈Ç Waszy≈Ñski. David Tamkin and Alex Tamkin adapted the play into the opera The Dybbuk, which was composed in 1933 but did not premiere until 1951. Sidney Lumet directed a segment for \\"Play of the Week\\" based on the play, but adapted into English by Joseph Liss. The program, starring Carol Lawrence (who had just become a star after playing Maria in the original Broadway production of West Side Story) aired on October 3, 1960.Hoberman, J., The Dybbuk. Port Washington, NY: Entertainment One U.S. LP, 2011. Based on the play, Leonard Bernstein composed music for the 1974 ballet Dybbuk by Jerome Robbins. Dramaturg and playwright Leon Katz created multiple adaptations of The Dybbuk in the early 1970s (Toy Show and Shekhina: The Bride), both directed by Rina Yerushalmi and produced at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club. It was adapted for CBS Radio Mystery Theater in 1974 under the title The Demon Spirit. Another version was made for \\"Saturday Night Theatre\\" on BBC Radio 4 in 1979 starring Cyril Shaps. The Hollywood Theater of the Ear, under the direction of Yuri Rasovsky, recorded their own English-language production, which was released by Blackstone Audio in 2009. The American composer Solomon Epstein composed The Dybbuk: An opera in Yiddish. The opera was premiered in Tel-Aviv, 1999, and this is apparently the world‚Äôs first original Yiddish opera. Ofer Ben-Amots composed The Dybbuk: Between Two Worlds, an opera based on the play which premiered in January 2008 in Montreal, Canada.

Chromolithography is a unique method for making multi-colour prints. This type of colour printing stemmed from the process of lithography,\\"Planographic Printing.\\" Seeing is Believing. 2001. The New York Public Library. 11 April 2007 . and includes all types of lithography that are printed in colour. When chromolithography is used to reproduce photographs, the term photochrome is frequently used. Lithographers sought to find a way to print on flat surfaces with the use of chemicals instead of raised relief or recessed intaglio techniques.\\"Chromolithography and the Posters of World War I.\\" The War on the Walls. Temple University. 11 April 2007 <>. Chromolithography became the most successful of several methods of colour printing developed by the 19th century; other methods were developed by printers such as Jacob Christoph Le Blon, George Baxter and Edmund Evans, and mostly relied on using several woodblocks with the colours. Hand-colouring also remained important; elements of the official British Ordnance Survey maps were coloured by hand by boys until 1875. The initial chromolithographic technique involved the use of multiple lithographic stones, one for each colour, and was still extremely expensive when done for the best quality results. Depending on the number of colours present, a chromolithograph could take even very skilled workers months to produce. However much cheaper prints could be produced by simplifying both the number of colours used, and the refinement of the detail in the image. Cheaper images, like advertisements, relied heavily on an initial black print (not always a lithograph), on which colours were then overprinted. To make an expensive reproduction print, once referred to as a \\"chromo\\", a lithographer, with a finished painting in front of him, gradually created and corrected the many stones using proofs to look as much as possible like the painting, sometimes using dozens of layers.Clapper, Michael. \\"'I Was Once a Barefoot Boy!': Cultural Tensions in a Popular Chromo.\\" American Art 16(2002): 16-39. Process Chromolithography is a chemical process. The process is based on the rejection of water by grease. The image is applied to stone, grained zinc or aluminium surfaces, with a grease-based crayon or ink. Limestone and zinc are two commonly used materials in the production of chromolithographs, as aluminium unfortunately corrodes easily. After the image is drawn onto one of these surfaces, the image is gummed-up with a gum arabic solution and weak nitric acid to desensitize the surface. Before printing, the image is proved before finally inking up the image with oil based transfer or printing ink. In the direct form of printing, the inked image is transferred under pressure onto a sheet of paper using a flat-bed press. The offset indirect method uses a rubber-covered cylinder that transfers the image from the printing surface to the paper. Colours may be overprinted by using additional stones or plates to achieve a closer reproduction of the original. Accurate registration for multi-coloured work is achieved by the use of a key outline image and registration bars which are applied to each stone or plate before drawing the solid or tone image. Ben-Day medium uses a raised gelatin stipple image to give tone gradation. An air-brush sprays ink to give soft edges. These are just two methods used to achieve gradations of tone. The use of twelve overprinted colours would not be considered unusual. Each sheet of paper will therefore pass through the printing press as many times as there are colours in the final print. In order that each colour is placed in the right position, each stone or plate must be precisely 'registered,' or lined up, on the paper using a system of register marks. Chromolithographs are considered to be reproductions that are smaller than double demi, and are of finer quality than lithographic drawings which are concerned with large posters. Autolithographs are prints where the artist draws and perhaps prints his or her own limited number of reproductions. This is the true lithographic art form.\\"Chromolithography.\\" Beautiful Birds Exhibit.1999. Cornell University Library. 11 April 2007 . Origins Uncle Sam Supplying the World with Berry Brothers Hard Oil Finish, c. 1880. This cheaply produced chromolithographic advertisement employs a technique called stippling, with heavy reliance on the initial black line print. Alois Senefelder, the inventor of lithography, introduced the subject of colored lithography in his 1818 Vollstaendiges Lehrbuch der Steindruckerey (A Complete Course of Lithography), where he told of his plans to print using colour and explained the colours he wished to be able to print someday.Ferry, Kathryn. \\"Printing the Alhambra: Owen Jones and Chromolithography.\\" Architectural History 46(2003): 175‚Äì188. Although Senefelder recorded plans for chromolithography, printers in other countries, such as France and England, were also trying to find a new way to print in colour. Godefroy Engelmann of Mulhouse in France was awarded a patent on chromolithography in July 1837, but there are disputes over whether chromolithography was already in use before this date, as some sources say, pointing to areas of printing such as the production of playing cards.

The paintings were initially used as decoration in American parlours as well as for decoration within middle-class homes. They were prominent after the Civil War because of their low production costs and ability to be mass-produced, and because the methods allowed pictures to look more like hand-painted oil paintings.Gaffney, Dennis. \\"Chromolithography: Bringing Color to the Masses.\\" Antiques Roadshow. 2006.

Production costs were only low if the chromolithographs were cheaply produced, but top-quality chromos were costly to produce because of the necessary months of work and the thousands of dollars worth of equipment that had to be used.Clapper, Michael. \\"'I Was Once a Barefoot Boy!': Cultural Tensions in a Popular Chromo.\\" American Art 16(2002): 16-39. Although chromos could be mass-produced, it took about three months to draw colours onto the stones and another five months to print a thousand copies. Chromolithographs became so popular in American culture that the era has been labeled as \\"chromo civilization\\".Glanz, Dawn. \\"The Democratic Art: Pictures for a Nineteenth-Century America, Chromolithography 1840-1900 (Review).\\" Winterthur Portfolio 16(1981): 96-97. Over time, during the Victorian era, chromolithographs populated children's and fine arts publications, as well as advertising art, in trade cards, labels, and posters. They were also once used for advertisements, popular prints, and medical or scientific books.\\"Planographic Printing.\\" Seeing is Believing.2001. The New York Public Library. 11 April 2007 . Opposition to chromolithography Even though chromolithographs served many uses within society at the time, many were opposed to the idea of them because of their perceived lack of authenticity. The new forms of art were sometimes tagged as \\"bad art\\" because of their deceptive qualities. Some also felt that it could not serve as a form of art at all since it was too mechanical, and that the true spirit of a painter could never be captured in a printed version of a work. Over time, many chromos came to be made so cheaply that they could no longer be confused with original paintings. Since production costs were low, the fabrication of cheap chromolithographs became more a business than the creation of art, in contrast with the high quality chromolithographs targeted primarily at art- oriented audiences. Famous printers Louis Prang Main article: Louis Prang A famous lithographer and publisher who strongly supported the production of chromolithographs was Louis Prang. Prang was a German-born entrepreneur who printed the first American Christmas card.Stankiewicz, Mary Ann. \\"A Picture Age: Reproductions in Picture Study.\\" Studies in Art Education 26(1985): 86-92. He felt that chromolithographs could look just as good as, if not better than, real paintings, and he published well-known chromolithographs based on popular paintings, including one by Eastman Johnson entitled The Barefoot Boy. The reason Prang decided to take on the challenge of producing chromolithographs, despite criticisms, was because he felt quality art should not be limited to the elite. Prang and others who continued to produce chromolithographs were sometimes looked down upon because of the fear that chromolithographs could undermine human abilities. With the Industrial Revolution already under way, this fear was not something new to Americans at the time. Many artists themselves anticipated the lack of desire for original artwork since many became accustomed to chromolithographs. As a way to make more sales, some artists had a few paintings made into chromolithographs so that people in society would at least be familiar with the painter. Once people in society were familiar with the artist, they were more likely to want to pay for an original work. Lothar Meggendorfer German chromolithographers, largely based in Bavaria, came to dominate the trade with their low-cost high-volume productions. Of these printers, Lothar Meggendorfer garnered international fame for his children's educational books and games. Owing to political unrest in mid-19th century Germany, many Bavarian printers emigrated to the United Kingdom and the United States, and Germany's monopoly on chromolithographic printing dissipated. August Hoen A. Hoen & Co., led by German immigrant August Hoen, were a prominent lithography house now known primarily for its stunning E.T. Paull sheet music covers. They also made advertisements, maps, and cigar box art. Hoen and his brothers Henry and Ernest took over the E. Weber Company in the mid-1850s upon Edward Weber's death. August Hoen's son Alfred ran the firm from 1886 throughout the early 20th century. Rufus Bliss Rufus Bliss founded R. Bliss Mfg. Co., which was located in Pawtucket, Rhode Island from 1832 to 1914. The Bliss company is best known for their highly sought after paper litho on wood dollhouses. They also made many other lithoed toys, including boats, trains, and building blocks. M. & N. Hanhart Established in Mulhouse in 1830 by Michael Hanhart who initially worked with Godefroy Engelmann in London. The firm, established at Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square, was named after his two sons Michael and Nicholas. Artists like Joseph Wolf, Joseph Smit, J G Keulemans and others worked for him to produce natural history illustrations that were used in the Ibis (1859-1874), Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London (1848-1900) and a range of books. The company wound up in 1902 after the death of Nicholas Hanhart and the rise of new printing techniques. Uses \\"Love or Duty\\", a chromolithograph by Gabriele Castagnola, 1873 Chromolithographs are mainly used today as fine art instead of advertisements, and they are hard to find because of poor preservation and cheaper forms of printing replaced it. Many chromolithographs have deteriorated because of the acidic frames surrounding them.Peters, Connie and Greg Peters. \\"True and Company: I Can See You Papa.\\" The Art of Print.True and Company. 11 April 2007 . As stated earlier, production costs of chromolithographs were low, but efforts were still being made to find a cheaper and faster way to mass-produce colored prints. Although purchasing a chromolithograph may have been cheaper than purchasing a painting, it was still expensive in comparison to other colour printing methods which were later developed. Offset printing replaced chromolithography in the late 1930s. To find or purchase a lithograph, some suggest searching for examples with the original frame as well as the publisher's stamp.Antiques Roadshow: \\"Chromolithography: Bringing Color to the Masses\\", Gaffney, Dennis. 2006. WGBH. 11 April 2007. Both European and American chromolithographs can still be found, and can range in cost from hundreds to thousands of dollars. The least expensive chromos tend to be European or produced by publishers who are less well-known compared to Prang. Bibliography *Twyman, Michael.

Named after Fran√ßois Vi√®te (more commonly referred to by the Latinised form of his name, \\"Franciscus Vieta\\"), the formulas are used specifically in algebra. Basic formulas Any general polynomial of degree n :P(x)=a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} +\\\\cdots + a_1 x+ a_0 (with the coefficients being real or complex numbers and ) is known by the fundamental theorem of algebra to have (not necessarily distinct) complex roots . Vieta's formulas relate polynomial's coefficients to signed sums of products of the roots as follows: :\\\\begin{cases} r_1 + r_2 + \\\\dots + r_{n-1} + r_n = -\\\\dfrac{a_{n-1}}{a_n} \\\\\\\\\\\\ (r_1 r_2 + r_1 r_3+\\\\cdots + r_1 r_n) + (r_2r_3 + r_2r_4+\\\\cdots + r_2r_n)+\\\\cdots + r_{n-1}r_n = \\\\dfrac{a_{n-2}}{a_{n}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ {} \\\\quad \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ r_1 r_2 \\\\dots r_n = (-1)^n \\\\dfrac{a_0}{a_n}. \\\\end{cases} Vieta's formulas can equivalently be written as : \\\\sum_{1\\\\le i_1 < i_2 < \\\\cdots < i_k\\\\le n} \\\\left(\\\\prod_{j = 1}^k r_{i_j}\\\\right)=(-1)^k\\\\frac{a_{n-k}}{a_n}, for (the indices are sorted in increasing order to ensure each product of roots is used exactly once. The left-hand sides of Vieta's formulas are the elementary symmetric functions of the roots. Generalization to rings Vieta's formulas are frequently used with polynomials with coefficients in any integral domain . Then, the quotients a_i/a_n belong to the ring of fractions of (and possibly are in itself if a_n happens to be invertible in ) and the roots r_i are taken in an algebraically closed extension. Typically, is the ring of the integers, the field of fractions is the field of the rational numbers and the algebraically closed field is the field of the complex numbers. Vieta's formulas are then useful because they provide relations between the roots without having to compute them. For polynomials over a commutative ring which is not an integral domain, Vieta's formulas are only valid when a_n is a non zero-divisor and P(x) factors as a_n(x-r_1)(x-r_2)\\\\dots(x-r_n). For example, in the ring of the integers modulo 8, the polynomial P(x)=x^2-1 has four roots: 1, 3, 5, and 7. Vieta's formulas are not true if, say, r_1=1 and r_2=3, because P(x) eq (x-1)(x-3). However, P(x) does factor as (x-1)(x-7) and as (x-3)(x-5), and Vieta's formulas hold if we set either r_1=1 and r_2=7 or r_1=3 and r_2=5. Example Vieta's formulas applied to quadratic and cubic polynomial: The roots r_1, r_2 of the quadratic polynomial P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c satisfy : r_1 + r_2 = -\\\\frac{b}{a}, \\\\quad r_1 r_2 = \\\\frac{c}{a}. The first of these equations can be used to find the minimum (or maximum) of ; see . The roots r_1, r_2, r_3 of the cubic polynomial P(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d satisfy : r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -\\\\frac{b}{a}, \\\\quad r_1 r_2 + r_1 r_3 + r_2 r_3 = \\\\frac{c}{a}, \\\\quad r_1 r_2 r_3 = -\\\\frac{d}{a}. Proof Vieta's formulas can be proved by expanding the equality : a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} +\\\\cdots + a_1 x+ a_0 = a_n(x-r_1)(x-r_2)\\\\cdots (x-r_n) (which is true since r_1, r_2, \\\\dots, r_n are all the roots of this polynomial), multiplying the factors on the right-hand side, and identifying the coefficients of each power of x. Formally, if one expands (x-r_1)(x-r_2)\\\\cdots(x-r_n), the terms are precisely (-1)^{n-k}r_1^{b_1}\\\\cdots r_n^{b_n} x^k, where b_i is either 0 or 1, accordingly as whether r_i is included in the product or not, and k is the number of r_i that are excluded, so the total number of factors in the product is n (counting x^k with multiplicity k) ‚Äì as there are n binary choices (include r_i or x), there are 2^n terms ‚Äì geometrically, these can be understood as the vertices of a hypercube. Grouping these terms by degree yields the elementary symmetric polynomials in r_i ‚Äì for xk, all distinct k-fold products of r_i.  History  As reflected in the name, the formulas were discovered by the 16th century French mathematician Fran√ßois Vi√®te, for the case of positive roots. In the opinion of the 18th century British mathematician Charles Hutton, as quoted by Funkhouser, the general principle (not only for positive real roots) was first understood by the 17th century French mathematician Albert Girard: > ...[Girard was] the first person who understood the general doctrine of the > formation of the coefficients of the powers from the sum of the roots and > their products. He was the first who discovered the rules for summing the > powers of the roots of any equation.

While generalized transduction can occur randomly and more easily, specialized transduction depends on the location of the genes on the chromosome and the incorrect excision of the a prophage. Transduction is the process by which foreign DNA is introduced into a cell by a virus or viral vector. An example is the viral transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another and hence an example of horizontal gene transfer. Transduction does not require physical contact between the cell donating the DNA and the cell receiving the DNA (which occurs in conjugation), and it is DNase resistant (transformation is susceptible to DNase). Transduction is a common tool used by molecular biologists to stably introduce a foreign gene into a host cell's genome (both bacterial and mammalian cells).  Discovery (bacterial transduction)  Transduction was discovered by Norton Zinder and Joshua Lederberg at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 1952 in Salmonella. In the lytic and lysogenic cycles Transduction happens through either the lytic cycle or the lysogenic cycle. When bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) that are lytic infect bacterial cells, they harness the replicational, transcriptional, and translation machinery of the host bacterial cell to make new viral particles (virions). The new phage particles are then released by lysis of the host. In the lysogenic cycle, the phage chromosome is integrated as a prophage into the bacterial chromosome, where it can stay dormant for extended periods of time. If the prophage is induced (by UV light for example), the phage genome is excised from the bacterial chromosome and initiates the lytic cycle, which culminates in lysis of the cell and the release of phage particles. Generalized transduction (see below) occurs in both cycles during the lytic stage, while specialized transduction (see below) occurs when a prophage is excised in the lysogenic cycle.'' As a method for transferring genetic material  Transduction by bacteriophages  The packaging of bacteriophage DNA into phage capsids has low fidelity. Small pieces of bacterial DNA may be packaged into the bacteriophage particles. There are two ways that this can lead to transduction. =Generalized transduction= Generalized transduction occurs when random pieces of bacterial DNA are packaged into a phage. It happens when a phage is in the lytic stage, at the moment that the viral DNA is packaged into phage heads. If the virus replicates using 'headful packaging', it attempts to fill the head with genetic material. If the viral genome results in spare capacity, viral packaging mechanisms may incorporate bacterial genetic material into the new virion. Alternatively, generalized transduction may occur via recombination. Generalized transduction is a rare event and occurs on the order of 1 phage in 11,000. The new virus capsule that contains part bacterial DNA then infects another bacterial cell. When the bacterial DNA packaged into the virus is inserted into the recipient cell three things can happen to it: # The DNA is recycled for spare parts. # If the DNA was originally a plasmid, it will re-circularize inside the new cell and become a plasmid again. # If the new DNA matches with a homologous region of the recipient cell's chromosome, it will exchange DNA material similar to the actions in bacterial recombination. =Specialized transduction= Specialized transduction is the process by which a restricted set of bacterial genes is transferred to another bacterium. The genes that get transferred (donor genes) flank where the prophage is located on the chromosome. Specialized transduction occurs when a prophage excises imprecisely from the chromosome so that bacterial genes lying adjacent to it are included in the excised DNA. The excised DNA is then packaged into a new virus particle, which then delivers the DNA to a new bacterium. Here, the donor genes can be inserted into the recipient chromosome or remain in the cytoplasm, depending on the nature of the bacteriophage. When the partially encapsulated phage material infects another cell and becomes a prophage, the partially coded prophage DNA is called a \\"heterogenote\\". An example of specialized transduction is Œª phage in Escherichia coli. =Lateral transduction= Lateral transduction is the process by which very long fragments of bacterial DNA are transferred to another bacterium. So far, this form of transduction has been only described in Staphylococcus aureus, but it can transfer more genes and at higher frequencies than generalized and specialized transduction. In lateral transduction, the prophage starts its replication before excision in a process that leads to replication of the adjacent bacterial DNA. When the replicated DNA excises from the chromosome, bacterial genes located up to several kilobases from the phage can get packaged into new virus particles that are transferred to new bacterial strains. If the transferred genetic material provides sufficient DNA for homologous recombination, the genetic material will be inserted into the recipient chromosome.  Mammalian cell transduction with viral vectors  Rat nerve cells express red and green fluorescent proteins after viral transduction with two artificial adeno-associated viruses. Transduction with viral vectors can be used to insert or modify genes in mammalian cells. It is often used as a tool in basic research and is actively researched as a potential means for gene therapy. =Process= In these cases, a plasmid is constructed in which the genes to be transferred are flanked by viral sequences that are used by viral proteins to recognize and package the viral genome into viral particles. This plasmid is inserted (usually by transfection) into a producer cell together with other plasmids (DNA constructs) that carry the viral genes required for formation of infectious virions. In these producer cells, the viral proteins expressed by these packaging constructs bind the sequences on the DNA/RNA (depending on the type of viral vector) to be transferred and insert it into viral particles. For safety, none of the plasmids used contains all the sequences required for virus formation, so that simultaneous transfection of multiple plasmids is required to get infectious virions. Moreover, only the plasmid carrying the sequences to be transferred contains signals that allow the genetic materials to be packaged in virions, so that none of the genes encoding viral proteins are packaged. Viruses collected from these cells are then applied to the cells to be altered. The initial stages of these infections mimic infection with natural viruses and lead to expression of the genes transferred and (in the case of lentivirus/retrovirus vectors) insertion of the DNA to be transferred into the cellular genome. However, since the transferred genetic material does not encode any of the viral genes, these infections do not generate new viruses (the viruses are \\"replication-deficient\\"). Some enhancers have been used to improve transduction efficiency such as polybrene, protamine sulfate, retronectin, and DEAE Dextran.

Literary career Mausoleum of the Three Writers (Peretz, Dinezon, and Ansky) in Warsaw Initially he wrote in Russian, but from 1904 he became known mainly as a Yiddish author. He is best known for his play The Dybbuk or Between Two Worlds, written in 1914. The play was first staged in the Elyseum Theatre in Warsaw, on December 9, 1920, one month (at the end of the 30-day mourning period) after the author's death.Zylbercweig, Zalmen (ed.). \\"An-ski, Sh.\\", in Leksikon fun Yidishn Teater (Lexicon of Yiddish Theater). Vol. 1. New York: Elisheva, 1931. col. 71-78; here: 74. It was subsequently translated into a dozen or more languages and performed thousands of times all over the world. It is still being produced, along with numerous adaptations, as well as operas, ballets, and symphonic suites. (For example, in 2011 there were seven different productions.) It is considered the jewel of the Jewish theatre.1\\\\. Fernando Pe√±alosa, The Dybbuk: Text, Subtext, and Context. Tsiterboym Books, 2012. In the early years The Dybbuk was considered so significant that parodies of it were written and produced.Fernando Pe√±alosa, tr., Parodies of An-sky‚Äôs The Dybbuk. Bilingual Edition. Tsiterboym Books, 2012. Although The Dybbuk is Ansky‚Äôs best-known work, he published an impressive number of works of literature, politics and ethnography.

An-sky wrote a number of other plays, four of which are included in this collection, long out of print. One (Day and Night) is, like The Dybbuk, a Hasidic Gothic story. The other three plays have revolutionary themes, and were originally written in Russian: Father and Son, In a Conspiratorial Apartment, and The Grandfather. All four have recently been republished in a bilingual Yiddish-English edition.S. An-sky. Four Plays. Bilingual Edition, tr. Fernando Pe√±alosa. Tsiterboym Books, 2013. Ansky was also the author of the song Di Shvue (The Oath), which became the anthem of the Jewish Socialist Bund party.

Composition One type of non-intentional composition that he used relied on an algorithm he dubbed \\"diastic\\", by analogy to acrostic.Mordecai-Mark Mac Low, \\"The Role of the Machine in the Experiment of Egoless Poetry\\" in H. Higgins, & D. Kahn (Eds.), Mainframe experimentalism: Early digital computing in the experimental arts, pp.299 He used words or phrases drawn from source material to spell out a source word or phrase, with the first word having the first letter of the source, the second word having the second letter, and so forth, reading through (dia in Greek) the source. During the last 25 years of his life, he often collaborated with Anne Tardos. Awards In 1985, Mac Low won a Guggenheim Fellowship.

He observed that classical physics, which makes use of the concept of real numbers, cannot be simulated by a Turing machine, which can only represent computable reals. Deutsch proposed that quantum computers may actually obey the CTD principle, assuming that the laws of quantum physics can completely describe every physical process.

Gymnures resemble rats but are not closely related as they are not rodents: they are instead closely related to hedgehogs which also belong to Erinaceidae. They are thought to have appeared in Eastern Asia before their closest relatives, and changed little from the original ancestor, which is thought to have been also the ancestor of the shrews. Description Although the gymnures are more closely related to the hedgehogs, full grown gymnures superficially resemble large rats or shrews, or the North American Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginianis), which shares similar habits and ecological niches (an example of parallel evolution). The gymnure's body plan is believed to resemble that of the earliest mammals, with a large toothy head about 1/3 the length of the total body, a naked furless tail for balance and thermoregulatory purposes, and a plantigrade stance. In direct contrast to the closely related hedgehogs, gymnures are not spiny. They also have an outstanding sense of smell, and tactile response in the snout region. Distribution and habitat Gymnures inhabit moist jungle terrain in various locales of Southeast Asia, including Vietnam, Sumatra, China and the Malay Peninsula. Behaviour Gymnures are primarily carnivorous. They are nocturnal or crepuscular: they come out to forage at twilight or in the night to search the forest floor, using smell to find the animals that they eat. Gymnures eat various arthropods, mice, small reptiles and amphibians, with occasional fruit and fungi. Gymnures keep territories, and individuals are solitary except when breeding. Gymnures have a very strong scent, typically described as a rancid garlic or onion smell, which is produced by its territory-marking scent glands. Several creatures similar in form and niche, such as the opossum and solenodon, have an odor similar to the gymnure's. Classification This subfamily has alternately been called Echinosoricinae, Galericinae, and Hylomyinae. Some researchers prefer Hylomyinae because the specific relationships of the extinct genus Galerix to living erinaceids are uncertain. There are eight extant species in five genera: *Genus ‚Ä†Deinogalerix (Extinct) *Genus ‚Ä†Galerix (Extinct) *Genus Echinosorex **Moonrat (Echinosorex gymnura) *Genus Hylomys **Hylomys megalotis (Long-eared gymnure) **Hylomys parvus (dwarf gymnure) **Hylomys suillus (short-tailed gymnure or lesser moonrat) *Genus Neohylomys **Neohylomys hainanensis (Hainan gymnure or Hainan moonrat) *Genus Neotetracus **Neotetracus sinensis (shrew gymnure) *Genus Podogymnura **Podogymnura aureospinula (Dinagat gymnure or Dinagat moonrat) **Podogymnura truei (Mindanao gymnure or Mindanao moonrat) References ","title":"Gymnure"},{"id":"714079","text":"This is a list of the bird species recorded in Spain.

This was sent in a letter to John Locke on 14 November 1690 and built upon the textual work of Richard Simon and his own research. The text was first published in English in 1754, 27 years after his death. The account claimed to review all the textual evidence available from ancient sources on two disputed Bible passages: 1 John 5:7 and 1 Timothy 3:16. Newton describes this letter as \\"an account of what the reading has been in all ages, and what steps it has been changed, as far as I can hitherto determine by records\\",An Historical Account, p. 1 and \\"a criticism concerning a text of Scripture\\".An Historical Account, p. 2 He blames \\"the Roman church\\" for many abuses in the world and accuses it of \\"pious frauds\\". He adds that \\"the more learned and quick-sighted men, as Luther, Erasmus, Bullinger, Grotius, and some others, would not dissemble their knowledge\\".An Historical Account, pp. 1‚Äì2 1 John 5:7 In the King James Version Bible, 1 John 5:7 reads: Using the writings of the early Church Fathers, the Greek and Latin manuscripts and the testimony of the first versions of the Bible, Newton claims to have demonstrated that the words \\"in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one\\", that support the Trinity doctrine, did not appear in the original Greek Scriptures. He then attempts to demonstrate that the purportedly spurious reading crept into the Latin versions, first as a marginal note, and later into the text itself. He noted that \\"the √Üthiopic, Syriac, Arabic, Armenian, and Slavonic versions, still in use in the several Eastern nations, Ethiopia, Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia, Armenia, Muscovy, and some others, are strangers to this reading\\".An Historical Account, p. 25 He arguedAn Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture, p. 32 that it was first taken into a Greek text in 1515 by Cardinal Ximenes. Finally, Newton considered the sense and context of the verse, concluding that removing the interpolation makes \\"the sense plain and natural, and the argument full and strong; but if you insert the testimony of 'the Three in Heaven' you interrupt and spoil it.\\"An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture, p. 55 Today most versions of the Bible are from the Critical Text and omit this verse, or retain it as only a marginal reading. 1 Timothy 3:16 The shorter portion of Newton's dissertation was concerned with 1 Timothy 3:16, which reads (in the King James Version): Newton argued that, by a small alteration in the Greek text, the word \\"God\\" was substituted to make the phrase read \\"God was manifest in the flesh\\" instead of \\"which was manifested in the flesh\\".Newton only gave in translation the literal texts, \\"which\\" (from the Latin) or \\"who\\" (from some Greek mss). \\"These ancient Latins all cite the text after this manner, Great is the mystery of Godliness, which was manifested in the flesh\\" p. 231 In quoting Cyril of Alexandria Newton translates, \\"Ye err,\\" saith he, \\"not knowing the Scriptures, nor the great mystery of godliness, that is Christ; who was manifested in the flesh, justified in the spirit.\\" p.238. and \\"Moreover,\\" saith he, \\"in my opinion, that mystery of godliness is nothing else than he who came to us from God the Father; the Word, who was manifested in the flesh.\\" p.239. Newton contends that the original Greek was or ·ΩÖ (which), changed to ·ΩÉœÇ (who) and then to Œ∏ŒµœåœÇ (God) (see p. 230 and p. 232 \\"Chrysostom, I am satisfied that he read ·ΩÖ\\", p.234 Nestorius, p.237 John Cassian, and pp. 252‚Äì253 \\"it is more reasonable to lay the fault on the Greeks... in the Greek the sense was obscure; in the versions clear\\" .) Two Notable Corruptions About this from Newton, John Burgon commented \\"Over this latter reading, however, we need not linger; seeing that ·ΩÖ does not find a single patron at the present day. And yet, this was the reading which was eagerly upheld during the last century: Wetstein and Sir Isaac Newton being its most strenuous advocates.\\" Revision Revised, p.100 He attempted to demonstrate that early Church writers in referring to the verse knew nothing of such an alteration.In 1731 Johann Jakob Wettstein turned his attention to this passage. Summary of both passages Newton concludes: \\"If the ancient churches in debating and deciding the greatest mysteries of religion, knew nothing of these two texts, I understand not, why we should be so fond of them now the debates are over.\\"An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture. p. 88 With minor exceptions, it was only in the nineteenth century that Bible translations appeared changing these passages. Modern versions of the Bible from the Critical Text usually omit the addition to 1 John 5:7, but some place it in a footnote, with a comment indicating that \\"it is not found in the earliest manuscripts\\".Biblegateway. Modern translations of 1 Timothy 3:16 following the Critical Text now typically replace \\"God\\" with \\"He\\" or \\"He who\\", while the literal Emphasized has \\"who\\".Biblegateway A number of papers in the years following responded to Newton, notably John Berriman in 1741, who had seen at least some of Newton's text prior to publication. Later, Frederick Nolan in 1815, Ebenezer Henderson in 1830 and John William Burgon in the Revision Revised in 1883 all contributed substantially to the verse discussion. Historical background Newton did not publish these findings during his lifetime, likely due to the political climate. Those who wrote against the doctrine of the Trinity were subject to persecution in England. The Blasphemy Act 1697 made it an offence to deny one of the persons of the Trinity to be God, punishable with loss of office and employment on the first occasion, further legal ramifications on the second occasion, and imprisonment without hope for bail on the third occasion. Newton's friend William Whiston (translator of the works of Josephus) lost his professorship at Cambridge for this reason in 1711. In 1693 a pamphlet attacking the Trinity was burned by order of the House of Lords, and the next year its printer and author were prosecuted. In 1697 Thomas Aikenhead, an eighteen-year-old student charged with denying the Trinity, was hanged at Edinburgh, Scotland.The Watchtower April 15, 1977 page 245 paragraph 5 The dissertation was published in 1754.John Locke Manuscripts ‚Äì Chronological Listing: 1690 See also * Isaac Newton's religious views Notes References Further reading * John Berriman Theos ephaner≈çthƒì en sarki (romanized form) or A critical dissertation upon 1 Tim. iii. 16: wherein rules are laid down to distinguish in various readings which is genuine : an account is given of above a hundred Greek manuscripts of St. Paul's Epistles (many of them not heretofore collated) : the writings of the Greek and Latin Fathers and the ancient versions are examin'd and the common reading of that text, God was manifest in the flesh, is prov'd to be the true one : being the substance of eight sermons preach'd at the Lady Moyer's lecture in the Cathedral Church of St. Paul, London, in the years 1737 and 1738 * The History of the Works of the Learned 1741 p. 29‚Äì144 (A very readable review of the John Berriman book that goes chapter by chapter.) * Ebenezer Henderson The Great Mystery of Godliness Incontrovertible; or, Sir Isaac Newton and the Socinians foiled in the attempt to prove a corruption in the text, 1 Tim.

It operates several radio and television channels, over a domestic transmitter network as well as satellite. In 2014, more than 85% of HRT's revenue came from broadcast user fees with each household in Croatia required to pay 79 HRK (~‚Ç¨10) per month for a single television set, with the remainder being made up from advertising (which is limited by law).Circom-regional.org , Funding Arrangements HRT is divided into three joint companies - Croatian Radio (), Croatian Television () and Music Production (). The founder of HRT is the Republic of Croatia which exercises its founder's rights through the Croatian Government. Croatian Radio (then Radio Zagreb) was founded on 15 May 1926. This date is considered the date on which HRT was founded. Television Zagreb (today Croatian Television) began broadcasting on 7 September 1956. By the law enacted by the Croatian Parliament on 29 June 1990, Radio Television Zagreb was renamed to HRT. HRT operates as a provider of public broadcasting services, and Croatia provides independent funding in accordance with the Croatian Broadcasting Company Law and the State Aid Rules for Public Broadcasting Services. In carrying out its activities, HRT is independent of any political influence and commercial interest. In addition to the television, radio and internet portal, HRT also includes HRT Symphony Orchestra, HRT Jazz Orchestra, HRT Tamburitza Orchestra and HRT Choir. On 25 May 2012, HRT's archive of the television and radio program and its collection of musical production were given the status of Croatian cultural heritage. History Croatian Radiotelevision headquarters at Prisavlje, Zagreb Croatian Radiotelevision is the direct successor of the Radio station Zagreb () that started broadcasting on 15 May 1926 under its first director and co- founder, dr. Ivo Stern. During the first 14 years of its existence the Zagreb Radio station was owned by a private corporation. Radio Zagreb was nationalized on 1 May 1940. During the Independent State of Croatia, the station was known as Hrvatski krugoval. After World War II it began to operate as a state-owned radio station. Zagreb Radio station was the first public broadcasting facility in the southeast European area, including countries of former Yugoslavia. At the end of the first year of operation, Radio Zagreb company had a little over four thousand subscribers. On the 30th anniversary of the establishment of Zagreb Radio station, on 15 May 1956, the first television programme was broadcast from the transmitter built at Sljeme. For the next two years this was the only TV broadcasting service in the southeast European area. This was the first TV station in Yugoslavia and would later become a color station in 1972. In June 1990, the Croatian Parliament renamed the company from Radiotelevizija Zagreb to Hrvatska radiotelevizija. On 1 January 1993, HRT was admitted as a full active member of the European Broadcasting Union. The television channels were aired under the name \\"Croatian Television\\", Hrvatska televizija (HTV) between 1990 and 1993. Since then, the current name has been used. The radio broadcast unit is referred to as \\"Croatian Radio\\", Hrvatski radio (HR). Television Channels * HRT 1 (or Prvi program): HRT's first TV channel, previously known as TVZ 1. This is a general channel with daily news around the world, documentaries, religious programmes, series and movies. * HRT 2 (or Drugi program): HRT's second channel, previously known as TVZ 2. It is primarily used for sports broadcasts and entertainment programmes. The channel is known for its extensive footage of vintage films.

The Mexican salsa verde, though also called a \\"green sauce\\", is instead based on tomatillos; the New Mexico version uses a green chile base.  History  Green sauce has a long history in many parts of Europe. It was certainly present in the Middle Ages, and may date to the Classical period. Some possible herbal ingredients of Green Sauce The basic recipe is probably from the Near East and, as such, is probably at least 2,000 years old. Roman legionaries brought it to Italy, from where it was exported to France and Germany. Evidence suggests that it was introduced in Frankfurt by the Italian trading families Bolongaro and Crevenna around 1700. A possible origin of the German variant are French Protestant immigrants emigrating to Kurhessen in the 18th century. The German variant uses a different mix of herbs, since Mediterranean herbs were not available in Germany at the time. Ancient Rome The Apicius (1st century CE) mentions a Ius viride in avibus 'Green sauce for fowl' consisting of pepper, caraway, spikenard, cumin, bay leaves, a variety of green herbs, dates, honey, vinegar, wine, broth, and oil.  Italy  Italian salsa verde The Italian salsa verde is a cold rustic sauce, and includes parsley, vinegar, capers, garlic, onion, anchovies, olive oil, and possibly mustard. The ingredients are coarsely chopped, formerly by hand, now often in a food processor. In some regions, cubed bread is soaked in vinegar and blended with the other ingredients, which creates an emulsion somewhat similar to a vinaigrette. In other regions, there is no bread. Salsa verde is used as a condiment or dipping sauce for meats, fish, poultry, or vegetables. Salsa verde served with bollito misto in Piemonte and Lombardia is a \\"classic meat dish\\" served in many city and country restaurants. The salted lake sardines from the Lago di Como, called misoltini, are warmed or grilled and served with salsa verde. It is also served with other grilled or stewed fish. A salsa verde with garlic, called agliata, is a traditional specialty of the Siena region on the feast day of Saint John. Gremolata is a green sauce in Milanese cuisine based on parsley, lemon peel, and garlic, and is the usual accompaniment for ossobuco.  France  The French sauce verte au pain was already known in the Renaissance, and was originally a bread sauce very similar to the Italian. Today, sauce verte is usually mayonnaise flavoured with tarragon, and sometimes parsley and sage. Lemon juice is often used instead of vinegar.  Germany  Packages of herbs for \\"Frankfurter Gr√ºne So√üe\\" sold on regional markets \\"Frankfurter Gr√ºne So√üe\\" with potatoes Gr√ºne So√üe is a specialty of the German state of Hesse. Centres of popularity are the cities of Frankfurt am Main (where it is sometimes called \\"Grie So√ü\\") and Kassel, which lay claim to its origins. The Frankfurt-style is made exclusively from seven fresh herbs, namely parsley, chives, chervil, borage, sorrel, garden cress, and salad burnet together with sour cream, oil, vinegar, mustard, salt and added hard boiled eggs. Variants of other local areas, often varying by season, include dill, shallots, lovage, lemon balm, and even spinach. In more frugal times, daisy leaves, broad plantain leaves, and dandelion leaves have been used. The hard-boiled eggs are sieved or pureed before being mixed with sour cream to form the creamy base of the sauce. The fresh chopped herbs are then added. Some variations use buttermilk, quark, or yogurt instead of sour cream. In the city of Kassel, a combination of sour cream and Schmand is used. The sauce is served cold with peeled boiled potatoes or just with rye bread, as an accompaniment to either hard-boiled eggs or roast beef brisket. It may also be served with cooked fish or roast beef, or as a side dish to barbecue. A local schnitzel specialty, called Frankfurter Schnitzel, is always served with green sauce, along with apple cider (Apfelwein) as a traditional accompanying drink. Green sauce was supposedly Goethe's favourite condiment; a legend that his mother invented it is likely apocryphal. The local importance of the dish is shown by the abundance of green sauce at local markets and by the Green Sauce Monument installed in Frankfurt-Oberrad in 2007. The latter consists of seven small greenhouses with the main herbal ingredients and was part of the Luminale, a local art and light event. In many Hessian families, Green Sauce is part of the traditional meal eaten on Maundy Thursday, relating to its German name Gr√ºndonnerstag (literally Green Thursday). Britain British greensauce is made of herbs, especially sorrel, mixed with vinegar and sugar. It is eaten with meat. It is first documented in the 12th century in the writings of Alexander Neckham. His recipe includes sage, parsley, dittany, thyme, garlic, salt, pepper, and a spice which is little-known nowadays, costus. Sorrel was so heavily used in greensauce, that sorrel itself was sometimes called 'greensauce'. Argentina Chimichurri is a green sauce used in Argentina and other parts of Latin America, usually served on grilled meat.

He has served on the National Security Council staff and has written several articles and books on international relations. Currently, he is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, \\"where he works on Middle Eastern political- military affairs, focusing in particular on Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf countries. Before that he was Senior Fellow at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution and a Senior Advisor at Albright Stonebridge Group, a global business strategy firm. Early life and education Born to a Jewish family,Interfaith Families: \\"Interfaith Celebrities: High Holiday Celebrity Goings-on, a New Congressional Memoir and a Possible Beatle Conversion?\\" By Nate Bloom. November 8, 2011 Pollack obtained a BA from Yale University, in 1988, and went on to earn a PhD from MIT, under supervision of Barry Posen, in 1996. Personal life Pollack is married to the well-known television journalist Andrea Koppel, the daughter of Ted Koppel. Career He has served in a variety of roles in government. From 1988 until 1995, he was an analyst on Iraqi and Iranian military issues for the Central Intelligence Agency. He spent a year as Director for Near East and South Asian Affairs with the United States National Security Council. In 1999, he rejoined the NSC as the Director for Persian Gulf Affairs. He also served two stints as a professor with the National Defense University. Outside of government, he worked for the Brookings Institution as the director of research at its Saban Center for Middle East Policy. He previously worked for the Council of Foreign Relations as their director of national security studies. He has also written seven books, the first two of which were published in 2002. His first monograph, Arabs at War, examined the foreign policy of six Arab nations in the years between World War II and the Persian Gulf War. Advocacy of Iraq invasion In his second book, The Threatening Storm: The Case for Invading Iraq (pub. 2002), Pollack details the history of United States actions against Iraq since the Persian Gulf War of 1991. He says that the United States should invade Iraq, and describes ways of going about it. Pollack argued that Saddam Hussein was simply too volatile and aggressive in his policies to be trusted not to begin another conflict in a volatile region. In The Threatening Storm, Pollack argued \\"the only prudent and realistic course of action left to the United States is to mount a full-scale invasion of Iraq to smash the Iraqi armed forces, depose Saddam's regime, and rid the country of weapons of mass destruction.\\" Pollack predicted, \\"It is unimaginable that the United States would have to contribute hundreds of billions of dollars and highly unlikely that we would have to contribute even tens of billions of dollars.\\" Likewise, he wrote, \\"we should not exaggerate the danger of casualties among American troops. U.S. forces in Bosnia have not suffered a single casualty from hostile action because they have become so attentive and skillful at force protection.\\"Threatening Storm: The Case for Invading Iraq, Random House, 2002 Pollack is credited with persuading liberals of the case for the Iraq war. New York Times columnist Bill Keller, in supporting the Iraq war in 2003, wrote \\"Kenneth Pollack, the Clinton National Security Council expert whose argument for invading Iraq is surely the most influential book of this season, has provided intellectual cover for every liberal who finds himself inclining toward war but uneasy about Mr. Bush.\\"The War Expert, Columbia Journalism Review, November/December 2007 Liberal writer Matthew Yglesias in the LA Times also attested to Pollack's influence: > Of course, those of us who read Pollack's celebrated 2002 book, \\"The > Threatening Storm: The Case for Invading Iraq,\\" and became convinced as a > result that the United States needed to, well, invade Iraq in order to > dismantle Saddam Hussein's advanced nuclear weapons program (the one he > didn't actually have) might feel a little too bitter to once again defer to > our betters.D.C. elites want you to shush on Iraq, Matthew Yglesias, Los > Angeles Times, 2 August 2007 Many have criticized his support for the Invasion of Iraq, including Middle East correspondent Robert Fisk, who called The Threatening Storm the \\"most meretricious contribution\\" to the pre-war \\"debate\\" on military action and included it in the select bibliography section of his 2005 book The Great War for Civilisation in order to \\"show just how specific - and misleading - were the efforts to persuade Americans to invade.\\"Fisk, Robert (2006). The Great War for Civilisation: The Conquest of the Middle East. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, pp. 922, 1062. Many critics, as well as many of those who used the book to justify their support of the invasion, overlooked the more balanced presentation on the pros and cons of war to be found in The Threatening Storm. As Chris Suellentrop of Slate pointed out before the invasion on March 5, 2003: > Six months after The Threatening Storm's publication, however, Pollack's > book reads as much like an indictment of the Bush administration's > overeagerness to go to war as it does an endorsement of it. A more > appropriate subtitle for the book would have been The Case for Rebuilding > Afghanistan, Destroying al-Qaida, Setting Israel and Palestine on the Road > to Peace, and Then, a Year or Two Down the Road After Some Diplomacy, > Invading Iraq. In interviews and op-ed articles, Pollack himself still > supports the war, saying that now is better than never. But it's fair to say > that his book does not‚Äîor at least not Bush's path to it., Chris > Suellentrop, \\"Kenneth Pollack's The Threatening Storm: Does the 'invade Iraq > book say what you think it does?',\\" Slate, 5 March 2003 Pollack responded to the Suellentrop article by saying that he was unhappy that many people seemed to have read only the subtitle of his book, which had not been his choice. He also said: > given how far down the road the Bush Administration has taken us, I think > that we have no realistic choice but to go to war this year. And yet I think > the Administration has handled the diplomacy and public diplomacy of > coalition building very poorly, and I am deeply concerned about the impact > this will have both on postwar reconstruction and on our ability to garner > allies for the inevitable next crisis., J.D. Conner, \\"Unsubtle Subtitle: > Kenneth Pollack on The Case for Invading Iraq,\\" Slate, 9 March 2003 Pollack later was a strong supporter of the Iraq War troop surge of 2007 advocated by General David Petraeus, which entailed a buildup of US ground forces to improve the security of the Iraqi population and help Iraq increase its governmental capacity, develop employment programs, and improve daily life for its citizens. He laid out some of his arguments in support of the surge in the June 2007 NY Times article \\"A War We Just Might Win,\\" which was co- authored with Michael E. O'Hanlon of Brookings., Michael E. O'Hanlon and Kenneth M. Pollack, \\"A War We Just Might Win,\\" 30 July 2007 Other publications In 2004, his third book, The Persian Puzzle, was published. In contrast to his views on Iraq, in The Persian Puzzle he argued that though the threat of force is necessary in dealing with Iran, diplomacy rather than regime change by force is the best way of dealing with Iran because Iran's policy-makers are divided between pragmatists who are motivated by a desire to improve the economy and hardliners who fear U.S. attack and so seek a nuclear deterrent, - the United States can thus exploit this divide to negotiate a favourable agreement. He also argued that the hardliners leader, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, was, unlike Saddam Hussein, rational and risk-averse and so, even if Iran did acquire a nuclear capability, Iran could be deterred in a way that Saddam Hussein could not be. In 2007, Pollack co-authored the book Things Fall Apart: Containing the Spillover from an Iraqi Civil War with Daniel L. Byman. This book analyzed 12 recent civil wars to derive six common ways in which fullscale ethnic civil wars \\"spillover\\" to affect neighboring states. Pollack and Byman argued that while spillover can range from modest effects to very severe problems (like causing other civil wars or triggering regional wars among neighboring states) that the early evidence so far suggested that the United States should be prepared for Iraq's potential descent into all-out civil war to be on the worse end of the spectrum. The book went on to lay out thirteen different ways that the United States and its allies might fashion a \\"containment\\" strategy for Iraq, which offered some chance of preventing all-out civil war in Iraq from destabilizing the wider Persian Gulf region in the event that American efforts to stabilize the country failed. While Pollack and Byman argued that such a containment strategy would be very difficult to make work given the historical problems of doing so and the specific problems created by previous American actions in Iraq, they also concluded that containment would likely prove America's least bad option because U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf were so important that Washington would have to try to mitigate the impact of spillover. He has written numerous articles for publications such as the Atlantic Monthly and Foreign Affairs. He has also repeatedly testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He currently teaches Security Problems of the Middle East / Persian Gulf and Military Analysis at Georgetown's School of Foreign Service. Pollack's fifth book, A Path Out of the Desert: A Grand Strategy for America in the Middle East, was published in July 2008. In a review in Army Magazine, former commander of Multi-National Security Transition Command-Iraq LTG James M. Dubik, US Army Retired, described the book as providing a clear description of America's vital interests in the Middle East and presenting well-documented, cogent arguments on the threats posed by the regional anger and frustration bred by crippling societal problems. Pollack recommends a grand strategy for the United States and its allies in which they > encourage and enable the countries of the Middle East to pursue a gradual > process of political, economic and social reform‚Äîone that grows from within, > rather than being imposed from without; one that reflects the values, > traditions, history and aspirations of the people of the region themselves, > not a Western guess at them; one that recognizes that reform and stability > are not mutually exclusive but mutually reinforcing‚Äîand ultimately mutually > essential., LTG James M.

As they attempt to return to their respective settings, the characters interact with the various side characters of each other's universe and Timmy becomes romantically involved with Jimmy's classmate, Cindy Vortex. But Timmy's meddling with Goddard, Jimmy's robotic dog, and the seizure of the magical transporter from Jimmy by Mr. Crocker, Timmy's fairy-obsessed teacher, both threaten each character's world in turn. The Jimmy Timmy Power Hour 2: When Nerds Collide (2006) The second TV movie premiered on Nickelodeon on January 16, 2006. Timmy and Jimmy enter each other's worlds for a second time, both wanting to ask Cindy out to their school dance celebrating Friday the 13th. In an attempt to gain Cindy's affections, the two engage in a battle of smarts that sends Jimmy and his friends to Dimmsdale. As Jimmy seeks to prove that Timmy is a fraudulent scientist, Cosmo and Wanda struggle to keep their existence a secret from the people of Retroville. Meanwhile, Professor Calamitous, who is of Jimmy's universe, unleashes a surge of anti-fairies from Fairy World that threatens the rotation of Timmy's Earth. Jorgen von Strangle, the muscular fairy supervisor and enforcer of Da Rules, gets increasingly frustrated by Jimmy's and Timmy's friends and their manipulation of fairy magic. The Jimmy Timmy Power Hour 3: The Jerkinators (2006) The third and final TV movie premiered on Nickelodeon on July 21, 2006. In their third and final encounter, Timmy and Jimmy make amends while trying to defeat the enemies from their own universes‚Äîincluding a monster that they concoct together‚Äîwhile accidentally rejecting their respective friends in the process, including Cindy. Initially, they are unable to make the monster evil enough to fight them properly, but when they succeed, he absorbs Cosmo and Wanda's magic and Jimmy's intelligence, and begins destroying both children's universes.

This blending of animation techniques was a technical challenge for the studios responsible for both series, according to Keith Alcorn, co-founder of series producer DNA Productions. Release and reception According to Variety, the first film was seen by nearly five million viewers on its Nickelodeon premiere, on May 7, 2004. Terry Kelleher of People gave the first film three stars out of four, calling it a \\"blast of creativity\\" although hard to follow. The Washington Post similarly gave it praise. The network considered it a success. The second film, aired January 16, 2006, was seen by nearly 5.5 million viewers, according to The New York Times. The third and final film aired July 21, 2006.

Published in 1999, the novel is a loose prequel (set twenty thousand years earlier) to his earlier novel A Fire Upon the Deep (1992). The title is coined by one of the story's main characters in a debate, in a reference to the hibernating habits of his species and to the vastness of space. Background The plot begins with the discovery of an intelligent alien species on a planet orbiting an anomalous star, dubbed OnOff because for 215 of every 250 years it is dormant, releasing almost no detectable energy. During this period, the planet freezes and its fauna go into hibernation. The planet's inhabitants, called \\"Spiders\\" by the humans for their resemblance to arachnids, have reached a stage of technological development very similar to that of Earth's humans in the early 20th century, although humans believe that they may once have been capable of space travel. If this is true, then whoever can establish ties with the aliens first could reap unimaginable rewards; humans have made contact with only one other intelligent (but non- technological) alien species in millennia of travel through the stars. Two human groups launch expeditions to the Spider world: the Qeng Ho (pronounced Chung Ho and named after the explorer Zheng He), traders who have developed a common interstellar culture for humanity; and the Emergents, a civilization that literally enslaves selected human minds and has only recently re-emerged from a Dark Age. Plot summary The Qeng Ho arrive at the OnOff star shortly before the Emergent fleet, a few years before the sun turns on, at which point the Spider civilization will \\"wake up\\" and continue its climb into a technological civilization. A reception held by the Emergents doubles as a vector to infect the Qeng Ho with a timed \\"mindrot\\" virus. The Emergents time an ambush to take advantage of the onset of symptoms. During these events, a concurrent history of the Spider civilization unfolds ‚Äì mainly through the picaresque, and then increasingly political and technocratic, experiences of a small group of liberal-minded and progressive Spiders. Their struggles against ignorance and obsolescent traditions are coloured with oddly human-like descriptions and nomenclature, prefiguring some major plot revelations towards the end of the story. Far above, after a close fight, the Emergents subjugate the Qeng Ho; but losses to both sides force them to combine and adopt the so- called \\"Lurker strategy\\", monitoring and aiding the Spiders' technological development, waiting until they build up the massive infrastructure and technological base that the visitors need in order to repair their vessels. The mindrot virus originally manifested itself on the Emergents' home world as a devastating plague, but they subsequently mastered it and learned to use it both as a weapon and as a tool for mental domination. Emergent culture uses mindrot primarily in the form of a variant which technicians can manipulate in order to release neurotoxins to specific parts of the brain. An active MRI- type device triggers changes through dia- and paramagnetic biological molecules. By manipulating the brain in this way, Emergent managers induce obsession with a single idea or specialty, which they call Focus, essentially turning people into brilliant appliances. Many Qeng Ho become Focused against their will, and the Emergents retain the rest of the population under mass surveillance, with only a portion of the crew not in suspended animation. The Qeng Ho trading culture gradually starts to dilute this, by demonstrating to the Emergents certain benefits of tolerated and restricted free trade; the two human cultures merge to some extent over the decades of forced co-operation. Pham Nuwen, the founder of the Qeng Ho trading culture, is living aboard the fleet under the pseudonym Pham Trinli, posing as an inept and bumbling fleet elder. He subverts the Emergents' own oppressive security systems through a series of high-risk ruses. During his plotting he begins to admire the Emergents' Focus technology, seeing it as the missing link in his lifelong goal to create a true interstellar empire and break the cycle of collapse-and- rebuild that plagues human planetary civilizations. The plan to wrest fleet control from the Emergents, however, requires the co-operation of Ezr Vinh, a much younger Qeng Ho who, through attrition, has become the Qeng Ho \\"Fleet Manager\\". Ezr's position as the unique liaison officer between Qeng Ho and Emergents leads him to despair, and he accepts Pham Nuwen's offer to join a plot against the Emergents as a way to personal redemption as well as to take revenge against the Emergents. However, his understanding of Pham's ambitions for Focus technology leads to a confrontation between them over the future use of Focus by the Qeng Ho. With new knowledge of the effects and victims of Focus, Pham is forced to admit the cost is too high, and the two reach an agreement and continue their plotting. The critical moment comes when the Emergents attempt to provoke a nuclear war on the Spider home-world in order to seize power. The conspirators subvert the Emergents' systems and put their plans in action, but so do a small group of Spiders who have become aware of the humans and have been working in secret for years to subvert their Focused as well. Together, the two sides successfully defeat the ruling class of the Emergents. The combined Emergent/Qeng Ho fleet now negotiates with the Spider civilization as a trading partner. Pham announces his plans to free all of the Focused in the entire Emergent civilization, and, if he survives that, to go to the Galactic Center to find the source of the OnOff star and the strange technology remnants that have clearly traveled with it. Elements Interstellar culture The book discusses some of the problems of trying to maintain an interstellar trading culture without access to superluminal travel or to superluminal communication. Time-measurement details provide an interesting concept in the book: the Qeng Ho measure time primarily in terms of seconds, since the notion of days, months, and years has no usefulness between various star-systems. The timekeeping system uses terms such as kiloseconds and megaseconds. The Qeng Ho's computer and timekeeping systems feature the advent of \\"programmer archaeologists\\": the Qeng Ho are packrats of computer programs and systems, retaining them over millennia, even as far back to the era of Unix programs (as implied by one passage mentioning that the fundamental time-keeping system is the Unix epoch): This massive accumulation of data implies that almost any useful program one could want already exists in the Qeng Ho fleet library, hence the need for computer archaeologists to dig up needed programs, work around their peculiarities and bugs, and assemble them into useful constructs. Time The Qeng Ho and other spacers in this series use kiloseconds, megaseconds, and gigaseconds as a unit of time. A kilosecond roughly equals 17 minutes, megaseconds are close to 277.76 hours or 11.57 days and a Gigasecond is 31.69 years. Localizers With this work, Vinge introduces \\"localizers\\" to his set of science-fiction concepts. Localizers are tiny devices which can contain a simple processor, sensors, and short-range communications. Vinge explores how intelligent control can use mesh networking of these devices in ways quite different from those of traditional computer networks. Relation to A Fire Upon the Deep Only one concrete connection links A Deepness in the Sky with A Fire Upon the Deep: the character of Pham Nuwen, the \\"Programmer-at-Arms\\", who appears in both books. Hints occur about the \\"Zones of Thought\\" mentioned in Fire. That novel posits that space around the Milky Way is divided into concentric layers called \\"Zones\\", each being constrained by different laws of physics and each allowing for different degrees of biological and technological advancement. The innermost, the \\"Unthinking Depths\\", surrounds the galactic core and is incapable of supporting advanced life forms at all. The next layer, the \\"Slow Zone\\", is roughly equivalent to the real world in behavior and potential. Further out, the zone named the \\"Beyond\\" can support futuristic technologies such as AI and FTL travel. The outermost zone, the \\"Transcend\\", contains most of the galactic halo and is populated by incomprehensibly vast and powerful posthuman entities. A Deepness in the Sky takes place in the Slow Zone, though Vinge does not explain the connections, and the characters in the story remain unaware of the zones' existence. The sun's inexplicably strange behavior, the unusual planetary system (with only a solitary planet and several asteroid- sized diamonds), and the discovery of \\"cavorite\\" on the planet may indicate the system originated in the Transcend, though it is currently moving outward from the Unthinking Depths. Vinge's characters speculate that the Spiders descend from an ancient star-faring civilization, and that the anti-gravity material and other strange artifacts have connections with that civilization. Unfortunately, they guess the structure of the Zones (though not the actual properties) backwards, coming to the conclusion that the bright center of the galaxy is the most likely location for advanced civilization. This leads Pham on his path inwards to the Unthinking Depths, and his eventual resurrection. Relation to The Outcasts of Heaven Belt Joan D. Vinge has indicated that her novel The Outcasts of Heaven Belt is also set in the Slow Zone of the Zones of Thought setting.Vinge, Joan D. (2008-11). \\"A letter to my readers.\\" Both novels show their spacefaring civilizations using seconds, kiloseconds, megaseconds, and gigaseconds as their primary units of time. A kilosecond roughly equals 17 minutes. Megaseconds are close to 277.76 hours or 11.57 days. A Gigasecond is 31.69 years. Reception Deepness won the 2000 Hugo Award for Best Novel, the 2000 John W.

History Tin was initially used on text-only display terminals connected via a slow serial interface to a multi-user time sharing central server, where graphics were generally not supported and when the computer mouse did not yet exist. At the time, tin was considered to be somewhat of a high-resource program in this environment (similar to the Pine email client) due to its use of terminal cursor control and page-oriented text scrolling to make navigating usenet easier. While it did not have graphics support it does provide a visually organized browser-oriented drill-down list of groups, subjects, and then articles, as opposed to simply scrolling endless pages and menus upwards from the bottom of the screen. Tin is available for a variety of Unix-like operating systems. It is based on the TASS newsreader, whose source code had been posted in 1991 on USENET by Rich Skrenta. The work on tin was begun shortly afterwards by Iain Lea, who provided information for the IETF RFC 2980. Since 1996, tin has been maintained by Urs Jan√üen. The program is generally compared with trn or nn. Some note that tin has the most flexible threading support. Tin runs on any UNIX or POSIX platform. This is because tin was an early adopter of autoconf, in 1996. Older versions of tin also ran on OpenVMS; the newer versions which have UTF-8 support do not. The original tin used termcap. Along with the portability improvements gained by using autoconf, its developers improved the adaptability by making it work with terminfo or curses‚Äîagain improving portability. Other changes, such as localization using gettext, as well as IPv6 support have kept the application current. Unlike trn or nn, it is easy to follow the progress of changes since 1995 in tin because its changelog is detailed and dated.

Biography  He learned about biology early from his father Eug√®ne Nicolle, a doctor at a Rouen hospital. He was educated at the Lyc√©e Pierre Corneille in Rouen.Lyc√©e Pierre Corneille de Rouen - History He received his M.D. in 1893 from the Pasteur Institute. At this point he returned to Rouen, as a member of the Medical Faculty until 1896 and then as Director of the Bacteriological Laboratory. In 1903 Nicolle became Director of the Pasteur Institute in Tunis, where he did his Nobel Prize-winning work on typhus, bringing H√©l√®ne Sparrow with him as laboratory chief. He was still director of the Institute when he died in 1936. He was a key researcher in discovering a deadly organism, Toxoplasma. He also wrote fiction and philosophy throughout his life, including the books Le P√¢tissier de Bellone, Les deux Larrons, and Les Contes de Marmouse. He married Alice Avice in 1895, and had two children, Marcelle (b. 1896) and Pierre (b. 1898).  Accomplishments  Nicolle's major accomplishments in bacteriology and parasitology were: *The discovery of the transmission method of typhus fever *The introduction of a vaccination for Malta fever *The discovery of the transmission method of tick fever *His studies of cancer, scarlet fever, rinderpest, measles, influenza, tuberculosis and trachoma. *Identification of the parasitic organism Toxoplasma gondii within the tissues of the gundi (Ctenodactylus gundi). During his life Nicolle wrote a number of non-fiction and bacteriology books, including Le Destin des Maladies infectieuses; La Nature, conception et morale biologiques; Responsabilit√©s de la M√©decine, and La Destin√©e humaine.  Discovery of the vector  Nicolle's discovery came about first from his observation that, while epidemic typhus patients were able to infect other patients inside and outside the hospital, and their very clothes seemed to spread the disease, they were no longer infectious when they had had a hot bath and a change of clothes. Once he realized this, he reasoned that it was most likely that lice were the vector for epidemic typhus. In June 1909 Nicolle tested his theory by infecting a chimpanzee with typhus, retrieving the lice from it, and placing it on a healthy chimpanzee. Within 10 days the second chimpanzee had typhus as well. After repeating his experiment he was sure of it: lice were the carriers. Further research showed that the major transmission method was not louse bites but excrement: lice infected with typhus turn red and die after a couple of weeks, but in the meantime they excrete a large number of microbes. When a small quantity of this is rubbed on the skin or eye, an infection occurs.  Attempt at a vaccine  Nicolle surmised that he could make a simple vaccine by crushing up the lice and mixing it with blood serum from recovered patients. He first tried this vaccine on himself, and when he stayed healthy he tried it on a few children (because of their better immune systems), who developed typhus but recovered. He did not succeed in his effort to develop a practical vaccine. The next step would be taken by Rudolf Weigl in 1930. Religious Views Baptised a Catholic, Nicolle left the faith when we was twelve. Starting in 1934, he felt spiritual anxiety, and he was reconciled with the Church in August 1935 after communicating with a Jesuit priest.https://www.persee.fr/doc/inrp_0298-5632_1988_ant_3_1_6153http://www.devozioni.altervista.org/testi/opuscoli_vari/angel_pena/ritorno_a_casa.pdf Notes  References   External links  * including the text of the Nobel Lecture Investigations on Typhus Schultz MG, Morens DM.

In probability and statistics, the definition of correlation always includes a standardising factor in such a way that correlations have values between ‚àí1 and +1. If X and Y are two independent random variables with probability density functions f and g, respectively, then the probability density of the difference Y - X is formally given by the cross-correlation (in the signal- processing sense) f \\\\star g; however, this terminology is not used in probability and statistics. In contrast, the convolution f * g (equivalent to the cross-correlation of f(t) and g(-t)) gives the probability density function of the sum X + Y. Cross-correlation of deterministic signals For continuous functions f and g, the cross-correlation is defined as:Bracewell, R. \\"Pentagram Notation for Cross Correlation.\\" The Fourier Transform and Its Applications.

If f and g are both continuous periodic functions of period T, the integration from -\\\\infty to \\\\infty is replaced by integration over any interval [t_0,t_0+T] of length T: which is equivalent to :(f \\\\star g)(\\\\tau)\\\\ \\\\triangleq \\\\int_{t_0}^{t_0+T} \\\\overline{f(t-\\\\tau)} g(t)\\\\,dt Similarly, for discrete functions, the cross-correlation is defined as: which is equivalent to :(f \\\\star g)[n]\\\\ \\\\triangleq \\\\sum_{m=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\overline{f[m-n]} g[m]. For finite discrete functions f,g\\\\in\\\\mathbb{C}^N, the (circular) cross-correlation is defined as: which is equivalent to :(f \\\\star g)[n]\\\\ \\\\triangleq \\\\sum_{m=0}^{N-1} \\\\overline{f[(m-n)_{\\\\text{mod}~N}]} g[m]. For finite discrete functions f\\\\in\\\\mathbb{C}^N, g\\\\in\\\\mathbb{C}^M, the kernel cross-correlation is defined as: where K_g = [k(g, T_0(g)), k(g, T_1(g)), \\\\dots, k(g, T_{N-1}(g))] is a vector of kernel functions k(\\\\cdot, \\\\cdot)\\\\colon \\\\mathbb{C}^M \\\\times \\\\mathbb{C}^M \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} and T_i(\\\\cdot)\\\\colon \\\\mathbb{C}^M \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C}^M is an affine transform. Specifically, T_i(\\\\cdot) can be circular translation transform, rotation transform, or scale transform, etc. The kernel cross- correlation extends cross-correlation from linear space to kernel space. Cross-correlation is equivariant to translation; kernel cross-correlation is equivariant to any affine transforms, including translation, rotation, and scale, etc. Explanation As an example, consider two real valued functions f and g differing only by an unknown shift along the x-axis. One can use the cross-correlation to find how much g must be shifted along the x-axis to make it identical to f. The formula essentially slides the g function along the x-axis, calculating the integral of their product at each position. When the functions match, the value of (f\\\\star g) is maximized. This is because when peaks (positive areas) are aligned, they make a large contribution to the integral. Similarly, when troughs (negative areas) align, they also make a positive contribution to the integral because the product of two negative numbers is positive. Animation displaying visually how cross correlation is calculated With complex-valued functions f and g, taking the conjugate of f ensures that aligned peaks (or aligned troughs) with imaginary components will contribute positively to the integral. In econometrics, lagged cross- correlation is sometimes referred to as cross-autocorrelation. Properties * The cross-correlation of functions f(t) and g(t) is equivalent to the convolution (denoted by *) of \\\\overline{f(-t)} and g(t). That is: *: [f(t) \\\\star g(t)](t) = [\\\\overline{f(-t)} * g(t)](t). * [f(t) \\\\star g(t)](t) = [\\\\overline{g(t)} \\\\star \\\\overline{f(t)}](-t). * If f is a Hermitian function, then f \\\\star g = f * g. * If both f and g are Hermitian, then f \\\\star g = g \\\\star f. * \\\\left(f \\\\star g\\\\right) \\\\star \\\\left(f \\\\star g\\\\right) = \\\\left(f \\\\star f\\\\right) \\\\star \\\\left(g \\\\star g\\\\right). * Analogous to the convolution theorem, the cross-correlation satisfies *: \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{f \\\\star g\\\\right\\\\\\\\} = \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{F} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{f\\\\right\\\\\\\\}} \\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{g\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, :where \\\\mathcal{F} denotes the Fourier transform, and an \\\\overline{f} again indicates the complex conjugate of f, since \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\overline{f(-t)}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}=\\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{f(t)\\\\right\\\\\\\\}}. Coupled with fast Fourier transform algorithms, this property is often exploited for the efficient numerical computation of cross-correlations (see circular cross-correlation). * The cross-correlation is related to the spectral density (see Wiener‚ÄìKhinchin theorem). * The cross-correlation of a convolution of f and h with a function g is the convolution of the cross- correlation of g and f with the kernel h: *: g \\\\star \\\\left(f * h\\\\right) = \\\\left(g \\\\star f\\\\right) * h. Cross-correlation of random vectors Definition (The author of the following should make an amendment, as he gives a cross-covariance matrix instead of cross-correlation. The matrix entries need to be normalized). For random vectors \\\\mathbf{X} = (X_1,\\\\ldots,X_m)^{\\\\rm T} and \\\\mathbf{Y} = (Y_1,\\\\ldots,Y_n)^{\\\\rm T}, each containing random elements whose expected value and variance exist, the cross- correlation matrix of \\\\mathbf{X} and \\\\mathbf{Y} is defined by cellpadding= 6 border border colour = #0073CF background colour=#F5FFFA}} and has dimensions m \\\\times n. Written component-wise: :\\\\operatorname{R}_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\mathbf{Y}} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\operatorname{E}[X_1 Y_1] & \\\\operatorname{E}[X_1 Y_2] & \\\\cdots & \\\\operatorname{E}[X_1 Y_n] \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{E}[X_2 Y_1] & \\\\operatorname{E}[X_2 Y_2] & \\\\cdots & \\\\operatorname{E}[X_2 Y_n] \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{E}[X_m Y_1] & \\\\operatorname{E}[X_m Y_2] & \\\\cdots & \\\\operatorname{E}[X_m Y_n] \\\\end{bmatrix} The random vectors \\\\mathbf{X} and \\\\mathbf{Y} need not have the same dimension, and either might be a scalar value. Example For example, if \\\\mathbf{X} = \\\\left( X_1,X_2,X_3 \\\\right)^{\\\\rm T} and \\\\mathbf{Y} = \\\\left( Y_1,Y_2 \\\\right)^{\\\\rm T} are random vectors, then \\\\operatorname{R}_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\mathbf{Y}} is a 3 \\\\times 2 matrix whose (i,j)-th entry is \\\\operatorname{E}[X_i Y_j]. Definition for complex random vectors If \\\\mathbf{Z} = (Z_1,\\\\ldots,Z_m)^{\\\\rm T} and \\\\mathbf{W} = (W_1,\\\\ldots,W_n)^{\\\\rm T} are complex random vectors, each containing random variables whose expected value and variance exist, the cross-correlation matrix of \\\\mathbf{Z} and \\\\mathbf{W} is defined by :\\\\operatorname{R}_{\\\\mathbf{Z}\\\\mathbf{W}} \\\\triangleq\\\\ \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\mathbf{Z} \\\\mathbf{W}^{\\\\rm H}] where {}^{\\\\rm H} denotes Hermitian transposition. Cross-correlation of stochastic processes In time series analysis and statistics, the cross-correlation of a pair of random process is the correlation between values of the processes at different times, as a function of the two times. Let (X_t, Y_t) be a pair of random processes, and t be any point in time (t may be an integer for a discrete-time process or a real number for a continuous-time process). Then X_t is the value (or realization) produced by a given run of the process at time t.  Cross- correlation function  Suppose that the process has means \\\\mu_X(t) and \\\\mu_Y(t) and variances \\\\sigma_X^2(t) and \\\\sigma_Y^2(t) at time t, for each t. Then the definition of the cross-correlation between times t_1 and t_2 is cellpadding= 6 border border colour = #0073CF background colour=#F5FFFA}} where \\\\operatorname{E} is the expected value operator. Note that this expression may be not defined.  Cross-covariance function  Subtracting the mean before multiplication yields the cross-covariance between times t_1 and t_2: Note that this expression is not well-defined for all-time series or processes, because the mean may not exist, or the variance may not exist. Definition for wide-sense stationary stochastic process Let (X_t, Y_t) represent a pair of stochastic processes that are jointly wide-sense stationary. Then the Cross-covariance function and the cross-correlation function are given as follows. =Cross-correlation function= cellpadding= 6 border border colour = #0073CF background colour=#F5FFFA}} or equivalently :\\\\operatorname{R}_{XY}(\\\\tau) = \\\\operatorname{E}\\\\left[X_{t-\\\\tau} \\\\overline{Y_{t}}\\\\right] =Cross-covariance function= or equivalently :\\\\operatorname{K}_{XY}(\\\\tau) = \\\\operatorname{E}\\\\left[\\\\left(X_{t-\\\\tau} - \\\\mu_X\\\\right)\\\\overline{\\\\left(Y_{t} - \\\\mu_Y\\\\right)}\\\\right] where \\\\mu_X and \\\\sigma_X are the mean and standard deviation of the process (X_t), which are constant over time due to stationarity; and similarly for (Y_t), respectively. \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\ ] indicates the expected value. That the cross-covariance and cross-correlation are independent of t is precisely the additional information (beyond being individually wide-sense stationary) conveyed by the requirement that (X_t, Y_t) are jointly wide-sense stationary. The cross-correlation of a pair of jointly wide sense stationary stochastic processes can be estimated by averaging the product of samples measured from one process and samples measured from the other (and its time shifts). The samples included in the average can be an arbitrary subset of all the samples in the signal (e.g., samples within a finite time window or a sub-sampling of one of the signals). For a large number of samples, the average converges to the true cross- correlation.  Normalization  It is common practice in some disciplines (e.g. statistics and time series analysis) to normalize the cross-correlation function to get a time-dependent Pearson correlation coefficient. However, in other disciplines (e.g. engineering) the normalization is usually dropped and the terms \\"cross-correlation\\" and \\"cross-covariance\\" are used interchangeably. The definition of the normalized cross-correlation of a stochastic process is :\\\\rho_{XX}(t_1,t_2) = \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{K}_{XX}(t_1,t_2)}{\\\\sigma_X(t_1)\\\\sigma_X(t_2)} = \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{E}[(X_{t_1} - \\\\mu_{t_1})\\\\overline{(X_{t_2} - \\\\mu_{t_2})}]}{\\\\sigma_X(t_1)\\\\sigma_X(t_2)}. If the function \\\\rho_{XX} is well- defined, its value must lie in the range [-1,1], with 1 indicating perfect correlation and ‚àí1 indicating perfect anti-correlation. For jointly wide-sense stationary stochastic processes, the definition is :\\\\rho_{XY}(\\\\tau) = \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{K}_{XY}(\\\\tau)}{\\\\sigma_X \\\\sigma_Y} = \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{E}[ \\\\left(X_t - \\\\mu_X\\\\right) \\\\overline{\\\\left(Y_{t+\\\\tau} - \\\\mu_Y\\\\right)}]}{\\\\sigma_X \\\\sigma_Y}. The normalization is important both because the interpretation of the autocorrelation as a correlation provides a scale-free measure of the strength of statistical dependence, and because the normalization has an effect on the statistical properties of the estimated autocorrelations. Properties =Symmetry property= For jointly wide- sense stationary stochastic processes, the cross-correlation function has the following symmetry property:Kun Il Park, Fundamentals of Probability and Stochastic Processes with Applications to Communications, Springer, 2018, 978-3-319-68074-3 :\\\\operatorname{R}_{XY}(t_1,t_2) = \\\\overline{\\\\operatorname{R}_{YX}(t_2,t_1)} Respectively for jointly WSS processes: :\\\\operatorname{R}_{XY}(\\\\tau) = \\\\overline{\\\\operatorname{R}_{YX}(-\\\\tau)} Time delay analysis Cross- correlations are useful for determining the time delay between two signals, e.g., for determining time delays for the propagation of acoustic signals across a microphone array. After calculating the cross-correlation between the two signals, the maximum (or minimum if the signals are negatively correlated) of the cross-correlation function indicates the point in time where the signals are best aligned; i.e., the time delay between the two signals is determined by the argument of the maximum, or arg max of the cross- correlation, as in : \\\\tau_\\\\mathrm{delay}=\\\\underset{t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}}{\\\\operatorname{arg\\\\,max}}((f \\\\star g)(t)) Terminology in image processing Zero-normalized cross-correlation (ZNCC) For image- processing applications in which the brightness of the image and template can vary due to lighting and exposure conditions, the images can be first normalized. This is typically done at every step by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. That is, the cross-correlation of a template, t(x,y) with a subimage f(x,y) is : \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{x,y}\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sigma_f \\\\sigma_t}\\\\left(f(x,y) - \\\\mu_f \\\\right)\\\\left(t(x,y) - \\\\mu_t \\\\right). where n is the number of pixels in t(x,y) and f(x,y), \\\\mu_f is the average of f and \\\\sigma_f is standard deviation of f. In functional analysis terms, this can be thought of as the dot product of two normalized vectors. That is, if : F(x,y) = f(x,y) - \\\\mu_f and : T(x,y) = t(x,y) - \\\\mu_t then the above sum is equal to : \\\\left\\\\langle\\\\frac{F}{\\\\F\\\\},\\\\frac{T}{\\\\T\\\\}\\\\right\\\\rangle where \\\\langle\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot\\\\rangle is the inner product and \\\\\\\\cdot\\\\ is the L¬≤ norm. Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz then implies that ZNCC has a range of [-1, 1]. Thus, if f and t are real matrices, their normalized cross-correlation equals the cosine of the angle between the unit vectors F and T, being thus 1 if and only if F equals T multiplied by a positive scalar. Normalized correlation is one of the methods used for template matching, a process used for finding incidences of a pattern or object within an image. It is also the 2-dimensional version of Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. Normalized cross-correlation (NCC) NCC is similar to ZNCC with the only difference of not subtracting the local mean value of intensities: : \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{x,y}\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sigma_f \\\\sigma_t} f(x,y) t(x,y) Nonlinear systems Caution must be applied when using cross correlation for nonlinear systems. In certain circumstances, which depend on the properties of the input, cross correlation between the input and output of a system with nonlinear dynamics can be completely blind to certain nonlinear effects. This problem arises because some quadratic moments can equal zero and this can incorrectly suggest that there is little \\"correlation\\" (in the sense of statistical dependence) between two signals, when in fact the two signals are strongly related by nonlinear dynamics.

The concept is also found in OS/2 and Microsoft Windows, although the semantics differ substantially. A traditional pipe is \\"unnamed\\" and lasts only as long as the process. A named pipe, however, can last as long as the system is up, beyond the life of the process. It can be deleted if no longer used. Usually a named pipe appears as a file, and generally processes attach to it for IPC.  In Unix  Instead of a conventional, unnamed, shell pipeline, a named pipeline makes use of the filesystem. It is explicitly created using \`mkfifo()\` or \`mknod()\`, and two separate processes can access the pipe by name -- one process can open it as a reader, and the other as a writer. For example, one can create a pipe and set up gzip to compress things piped to it: mkfifo my_pipe gzip -9 -c < my_pipe > out.gz & In a separate process shell, independently, one could send the data to be compressed: cat file > my_pipe The named pipe can be deleted just like any file: rm my_pipe A named pipe can be used to transfer information from one application to another without the use of an intermediate temporary file. For example, you can pipe the output of gzip into a named pipe like so: mkfifo -m 0666 /tmp/namedPipe gzip -d < file.gz > /tmp/namedPipe Then load the uncompressed data into a MySQL table like so: LOAD DATA INFILE '/tmp/namedPipe' INTO TABLE tableName; Without this named pipe one would need to write out the entire uncompressed version of file.gz before loading it into MySQL. Writing the temporary file is both time consuming and results in more I/O and less free space on the hard drive. PostgreSQL's command line utility, \`psql\`, also supports loading data from named pipes.  In Windows  A named pipe can be accessed much like a file. Win32 SDK functions \`CreateFile\`, \`ReadFile\`, \`WriteFile\` and \`CloseHandle\` open, read from, write to, and close a pipe, respectively. Unlike Unix, there is no command line interface, except for PowerShell. Named pipes cannot be created as files within a normal filesystem, unlike in Unix. Also unlike their Unix counterparts, named pipes are volatile (removed after the last reference to them is closed). Every pipe is placed in the root directory of the named pipe filesystem (NPFS), mounted under the special path \`\\\\\\\\.\\\\pipe\\\\\` (that is, a pipe named \\"foo\\" would have a full path name of \`\\\\\\\\.\\\\pipe\\\\foo\`). Anonymous pipes used in pipelining are actually named pipes with a random name. They are very rarely seen by users, but there are notable exceptions. The VMware Workstation PC hardware virtualization tool, for instance, can expose emulated serial ports to the host system as named pipes, and the WinDbg kernel mode debugger from Microsoft supports named pipes as a transport for debugging sessions (in fact, VMware and WinDbg can be coupled together ‚Äì as WinDbg normally requires a serial connection to the target computer ‚Äì letting driver developers do their development and testing on a single computer). Both programs require the user to enter names in the \`\\\\\\\\.\\\\pipe ame\` form. Windows NT named pipes can inherit a security context. Summary of named pipes on Microsoft Windows: * Intermachine and intramachine IPC * Half-duplex or full- duplex * Byte-oriented or packet-oriented * Reliable * Connection-oriented communication * Blocking or Nonblocking read and write (choosable) * Standard device I/O handles (\`ReadFile\`, \`WriteFile\`) * Namespace used to create handles * Inefficient WAN traffic (explicit data transfer request, unlike e.g. TCP/IP sliding window, etc.) * Peekable reads (read without removing from pipe's input buffer) The .NET Framework 3.5 has added named pipe support. Named pipes can also be used as an endpoint in Microsoft SQL Server. Named pipes are also a networking protocol in the Server Message Block (SMB) suite, based on the use of a special inter-process communication (IPC) share. SMB's IPC can seamlessly and transparently pass the authentication context of the user across to Named Pipes. Windows NT's entire NT Domain protocol suite of services are implemented as DCE/RPC service over Named Pipes, as are the Exchange 5.5 Administrative applications.

Content The Christian Science Hymnal includes both traditional Christian hymns and hymns unique to the Christian Science hymnal. The hymnal includes tunes from a variety of styles and nationalities. It gives metronomic markings to help musicians, but never a fixed tempo, so that the musicians may find the appropriate speed for the building, congregation, or situation themselves. The hymnal includes seven poems by the denomination's founder Mary Baker Eddy set to various tunes: Christ My Refuge, Christmas Morn, Communion Hymn, Feed My Sheep, Love, Mother's Evening Prayer, and Satisfied.‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the background on Eddy‚Äôs poems that are set to music in the Christian Science Hymnal?‚Äù Mary Baker Eddy Library. 12 December 2011 The hymnal also includes hymns written by John Greenleaf Whittier, Isaac Watts, Samuel Longfellow, and many others. A 2017 supplement added modern hymn and tune authors, such as Dietrich Bonhoeffer. History At the beginning of the Christian Science movement, congregants used other Christian hymnals, but in 1890 the Publishing Society printed a 17 hymn words-only booklet, which was followed two years later in 1892 by the first formal Christian Science Hymnal.The Christian Science Hymnal Longyear Museum. 24 April 2014 The hymnal contained 210 hymns, and generally presented two hymns on a single page, in their poetic form, in conjunction with two or three tunes to which either could be sung. Hymns 179-193 were presented individually, interlined with their respective tunes. Organist and music editor for the hymnal Lyman F. Brackett (1852-1937) contributed 99 of the book's tunes.Lyman F. Brackett hymnary.org The layout of the book is described in the Preface: :\\"The system of arrangement is original and unique. On the pages with the hymns, have been placed standard tunes familiar to every church-goer. Every second tune is by an English or German composer of unquestioned musical ability, and will be found adapted either to chorus- choir, or advanced congregational singing. Every third tune has been composed by Mr. Brackett especially for this work;...\\" After 1892, the hymnal was revised in 1898, 1903, and 1910.Did Mary Baker Eddy approve all the selections in the 1932 ‚ÄúChristian Science Hymnal‚Äù? Mary Baker Eddy Library. 26 October 2017 The revised hymnals presented the hymns interlined with their tunes for easier reading, as is common practice in America today. Eddy was not closely involved in the 1910 revision of the hymnal, but had input on a few hymns, for instance approving a tune for her poem Mother's Evening Prayer. 1932 edition In 1928 the Christian Science Board of Directors appointed initial committees in London and Boston to create another revision, which was published in 1932. Violet S. Hay was involved in this process as the chairman of the London committee, and seven of her hymns appear in the final product. The hymns in the 1932 edition were primarily alphabetical by first line, some with alternate tune settings, and include information on the author, tune composer, meter, and use by permission. There were 429 hymns/tunes: 297 hymns were presented with different tune settings (241 appeared in the 1910 edition). Alternate tunes setting the same hymn were presented in numerical succession in the main body of the book (a change from the 1910 edition). The final 29 entries were in the Supplement section which was present in the original printing of the 1932 book: :\\"In a few cases the familiar arrangement of a tune has been placed in the Supplement, and a new arrangement in the body of the book.... The Supplement, which is serially numbered though not alphabetically arranged, includes also hymns and tunes which are more or less locally or nationally rather than internationally serviceable.\\" Settings of Eddy's poems, Love, and Satisfied, first appeared with the 1932 edition. More numerous alternate settings of the seven hymns by Eddy were provided, as they are chosen often for use in worship services. Index listings include tunes alphabetically, tunes metrically, composers and sources, tempo indications, authors and sources, and first lines. Found in the Supplement section are the hymns, I Need Thee Every Hour, I'm a Pilgrim and I'm a Stranger, and Eternity, which were originally included in the hymnal at the request of Eddy. The 1932 version became the standard through the present day, typically in first blue, then brown cover, with an octagonal emboss of the Original Mother Church tower and Extension dome. It has been translated into numerous languages; the tunes and hymn numbers are maintained, joined to the vernacular versions of the texts. Visitors would be able to sing in their own language, joining with the congregation singing in the other language. New supplements and editions During the early 1980s, exploratory work was undertaken into a third edition, with many new tunes and texts planned for inclusion, but the project was shelved in 1988. In late 2008, a new supplement containing 33 additional hymns/tunes was published in booklet form. In 2017, The Church published Christian Science Hymnal: Hymns 430‚Äì603.

She published an important early catalog of stellar spectra using her own system of stellar classification, which was later adopted by the International Astronomical Union. She also spent many years studying the binary star Beta Lyrae. Maury was part of the Harvard Computers, a group of female astronomers and Human Computers at the Harvard College Observatory. Antonia Maury was awarded the Annie Jump Cannon Award in Astronomy in 1943. William Wilson Morgan, one of the developers of the MK system of stellar classification, which builds upon her work, has said that he considers Antonia Maury \\"for me, the single greatest mind that has ever engaged itself in the field of the morphology of stellar spectra.\\"  Early life  Antonia Caetana de Paiva Pereira Maury was born in Cold Spring, New York in 1866. She was named in honor of her maternal grandmother, Antonia Caetana de Paiva Pereira Gardner Draper, the daughter of a physician at the court of John VI of Portugal and Charlotte of Spain The family fled Portugal for Brazil because of the Napoleonic Wars. Maury's father was the Reverend Mytton Maury, an amateur naturalist, a direct descendant of the Reverend James Maury and one of the sons of Sarah Mytton Maury. Maury's mother was Virginia Draper, a daughter of Antonia Caetana de Paiva Pereira Gardner and Dr. John William Draper. Maury was also the granddaughter of John William Draper and a niece of Henry Draper and his wife Mary Anna Draper, all pioneering astronomers. Mary Anna Draper funded research at Harvard College Observatory through the creation of the Henry Draper Memorial Fund. As a result of their family connections, Antonia and her two siblings were exposed to science at a very early age. Her younger sister, Carlotta Maury, went on to become a geologist, stratigrapher, and paleontologist. Antonia Maury attended Vassar College, graduating in 1887 with honors in physics, astronomy, and philosophy. At Vassar she studied under the tutelage of renowned astronomer Maria Mitchell. She was one of seven graduates chosen to give addresses at her Commencement.  Astronomical work  After completing her undergraduate work, Maury went to work at the Harvard College Observatory as one of the so-called Harvard Computers, highly skilled women who processed astronomical data. Her salary was 25 cents, half the amount paid to men at that time. In 1887, Edward Charles Pickering had found the first spectroscopic binary or double star, Œ∂1 Ursae Majoris (Mizar A). Maury was asked to determine its orbit, which she did using periodic doubling of some of the lines in its spectrum. Then, in 1889, Maury discovered a second spectroscopic binary, Beta Aurigae, and calculated its orbital period. Learning of this work from a copy of the Annual Report of the Henry Draper Memorial, eminent astronomer John Herschel recognized the importance of her achievements by writing to Pickering, the observatory's director. Herschel asked Pickering \\"to convey to Miss Maury my congratulations on having connected her name with one of the most notable advances in physical astronomy ever made.‚Äù However, when the first spectroscopic binary and its orbit were more widely reported, the name connected with it was Pickering. The discovery was announced by Pickering in a presentation to the Philadelphia meeting of the National Academy of Sciences on November 13, 1889. The work was described in a paper \\"On the Spectrum of Zeta Ursae Majoris,\\" which appeared in the American Journal of Science in 1890. In both cases the only mention of Maury was a single line, stating that \\"a careful study of the results has been made by Miss. A. C. Maury, a niece of Dr. Draper\\". The sole author credit was given as Pickering. Harvard Computers at work, including Henrietta Swan Leavitt (1868‚Äì1921), Annie Jump Cannon (1863‚Äì1941), Williamina Fleming (1857‚Äì1911), and Antonia Maury (1866‚Äì1952). In 1888, Maury was assigned to observe stellar spectra of bright stars in the northern hemisphere and catalog them. Her work contributed to the construction of the Henry Draper Catalogue. By 1924, the Catalogue would contain 225,300 stellar spectra, described in terms of their characteristics. By 2017, it would have 359,083 entries. The Harvard Observatory staff used an alphabetical system of classification designed by Williamina P. Fleming and Annie Jump Cannon. Maury found their classification system inadequate and developed her own. It was considerably more detailed and included information about temperature and about the width, distinctness, and intensity of spectral lines. In 1891 Maury left the observatory and started teaching in the Gilman School in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Pickering asked her to return and complete her observations, and she said that she was uncomfortable completing her research if her work was unacknowledged. She returned in 1893 and 1895 and published her observations of stellar spectra in an important catalogue of classifications in 1897. Spectra of Bright Stars Photographed with the 11-inch Draper Telescope as Part of the Henry Draper Memorial and Discussed by Antonia C. Maury under the direction of Edward Charles Pickering (1897) presented the results of Maury's examination of 4,800 stellar photographs, using her own system of classification, and analyzed 681 bright northern stars in detail. It was the first observatory publication to have a women's name in the title. Pickering and others at the observatory disagreed with Maury‚Äôs system of classification and explanation of differing line widths, and refused to use it. It was partly in response to this negative reaction to her work that she decided to leave the observatory. However, by 1908 Danish astronomer Ejnar Hertzsprung had realized the value of her classifications and used them in his system of identifying very bright red giant stars from faint dwarf stars. Hertzsprung wrote to Pickering: Not until 1922 did the International Astronomical Union (IAU) modify its classification system based on the work done by Maury and Hertzsprung, a formulation known as the Hertzsprung‚ÄìRussell diagram. Astronomer Dorrit Hoffleit has presented scientific evidence to support the view that stellar morphology was held back by 30 years as a result of the failure to adopt Antonia Maury's stellar classification theory sooner. Between 1896 and 1918 Maury taught physics and chemistry at the Castle School (Miss C.E. Mason's Suburban school for girls) in Tarrytown, New York. She also gave lectures on astronomy at Cornell. In 1918, Maury returned to Harvard College Observatory as an adjunct professor. With Pickering's successor Harlow Shapley she was given credit for her work, which was published under her own name. She stayed in the observatory until her retirement in 1948. Her work summarizing many years of research on the spectroscopic analysis of the binary star Beta Lyrae was published in 1933.  Awards  Maury lunar crater Antonia Maury was a member of the American Astronomical Society and the Royal Astronomical Society. In 1943, she was awarded the Annie Jump Cannon Award in Astronomy by the American Astronomical Society. The lunar crater Maury and a number of smaller ejecta craters are co-named for Antonia Maury. They were originally named for her cousin, Commander Matthew Fontaine Maury, United States and later Confederate Navies and are, perhaps, the only lunar features shared by two cousins. In 1978, the Revised MK Spectral Atlas for Stars Earlier Than the Sun honored ‚ÄúAntonia C. Maury, Master Morphologist of Stellar Spectra‚Äù in its dedication.  Later years  After retirement, Maury pursued interests in nature and conservation. She belonged to the National Audubon Society and enjoyed bird-watching. She fought to save western Sequoia trees from being felled during wartime. For three years, Maury also served as curator of the John William Draper House in Hastings-on-Hudson, NY, where her grandfather and uncle had built observatories, and where the first photos of the moon as seen through a telescope were taken. Maury died on January 8, 1952, in Dobbs Ferry, NY.

The system uses regular 2D cameras in the Space Shuttle bay, on the Canadarm, or on the ISS along with cooperative targets to calculate the 3D position of an object. Because of the small number of viewing ports on the station and on the shuttle, most of the assembly and maintenance is done using cameras, which do not give stereoscopic vision, and thus do not allow a proper evaluation of depth. In addition the difficult conditions created by the particular conditions of illumination and obscurity in space, make it much more difficult to distinguish objects, even when the assembly work can be viewed directly, without using a camera. For instance, the harsh glare of direct sunlight can blind human vision. Also, the contrasts between objects in black shadows and objects in the solar light are much greater than in Earth's atmosphere, even where no glare is involved. Background The Advanced Space Vision System images objects with cooperative targets and uses the known positions of the targets to triangulate their exact relative positions in real time. The targets are composed of thin films of silicon dioxide layered with inconel to form an inconel interference stack. A stack like this has nearly no reflectivity in the Electromagnetic spectrum. The result is a black color that appears even blacker than the flattest black paint. In photos the disks look like small black dots, and a minimum of three are needed, so they are quite unobtrusive on most payloads. Development The basic elements of the system were devised at the National Research Council of Canada in the 1970s, to study car collisions. In 1990, development was transferred to Neptec Design Group, a small commercial enterprise located in Kanata, a suburb of Ottawa. The system runs on Neptec's Advanced Vision Unit (AVU) processing platform, which handles video routing, algorithm processing, video overlays, and the system interface. The operating system is the Unix-like and POSIX compliant QNX Real-time operating system, running the Photon windowing interface. The Photon implementation was optimized to be the most worry free direct manipulation interface possible for the particular needs and work habits of the astronauts. The Canadian Space Agency was involved at several stages in the development and deployment of the space vision system. Training for the system takes place in the simulators located at the agency's headquarters at the John H. Chapman Space Centre near Montreal. Implementation The system was first tested in its early form on STS-52 in October 1992, and used in subsequent missions. The advanced version was first tested on STS-74 in November 1995. The system has been used with success on shuttle flights since then, and with equal success for the assembly and maintenance of the station since 1997.

He was particularly known for his streamlined 1960s designs influenced by modernism and futurism, exploiting modern technology and new fabrics. Courr√®ges defined the go-go boot and along with Mary Quant, is one of the designers credited with inventing the miniskirt.  Early life  Courr√®ges was born in the city of Pau within the Bearnese region of the Pyrenees. He wanted to pursue design in art school but his father, a butler disapproved his passion as he wanted him to be an engineer. Courr√®ges attended √âcole Nationale des Ponts-et-Chauss√©es (√âcole des ponts ParisTech). During World War II, he became a pilot for the French Air Force.  Career  Women's suit set 15, Andr√© Courr√®ges, 1965 In 1945, at 25, after studying to be a civil engineer, Courr√®ges went to Paris to work at the fashion house Jeanne Lafaurie. A few months later, he went to work for Crist√≥bal Balenciaga. Courr√®ges worked for Balenciaga for 10 years mastering the cut and construction of garments. In 1961, Courr√®ges launched his own fashion house. He became known for extremely simple, geometric, modern designs, including the \\"little white dress\\" and pants for women. They were often paired with low- heeled white ankle boots, a style that became known as the Courr√®ges boot, and evolved into the popular go-go boot. His clientele were mature and conservative woman with high disposable income. His designs style was shaped by Balenciaga with garments that were well sculpted for women. Courr√®ge's autumn 1964 collection evolved the fashion industry with modern, futuristic designs that were unheard of during the time. The collection included tailored tunics and trousers which were paired with his version of the miniskirt. \\"He paired his shorter skirts with white or colored leather, calf-high boots that added a confident flair to the ensemble. This look became one of the most important fashion developments of the decade and was widely copied.\\" Controversy over who created the idea for the miniskirt revolves around Courr√®ges and Mary Quant. He explicitly claimed to have invented, accusing his London rival to the claim, Mary Quant of merely \\"commercialising\\" it. Courr√®ges presented short skirts (four inches above the knee) in January 1965 for that year's Spring/Summer collection. He had presented \\"above-the-knee\\" skirts in the previous year, with his August 1964 haute couture presentation proclaimed the \\"best show seen so far\\" for that season by The New York Times. Valerie Steele has stated that Courr√®ges was designing short skirts as early as 1961, although she champions Quant's claim to have created the miniskirt first as being more convincingly supported by evidence. Others, such as Jess Cartner-Morley of The Guardian explicitly credit Courr√®ges with having invented the miniskirt. The Independent also stated that \\"Courreges was the inventor of the miniskirt: at least in his eyes and those of the French fashion fraternity ... The argument came down to high fashion vs street fashion and to France versus Britain ‚Äì there's no conclusive evidence either way.\\" Alongside short skirts, Courr√®ges was renowned for his trouser suits, cut-out backs and midriffs, all designed for a new type of athletic, active young woman. Steele has described Courr√®ges's work as a \\"brilliant couture version of youth fashion.\\" One of Courr√®ges's most distinctive looks, a knit bodystocking with a gabardine miniskirt slung around the hips, was widely copied and plagiarised, much to his chagrin, and it would be 1967 before he again held a press showing for his work. Courr√®ges's favoured materials included plastics such as vinyl and stretch fabrics like Lycra. While he preferred white and silver, he often used flashes of citrus colour, and the predominantly white designs in his August 1964 show were tempered with touches of his signature clear pink, a \\"bright stinging\\" green, various shades of brown from dark to pale, and poppy red. In 1967 Courr√®ges married Coqueline Barri√®re, his design assistant. They had met while working together at Balenciaga, and worked together as a husband and wife team for the rest of his life. In 1968 Courr√®ges sold a share of his company to L'Or√©al in order to finance his expansion, which, by 1972, included 125 boutiques around the world. That year, Courr√®ges was commissioned to design staff uniforms for the Munich Olympics that year. He began offering menswear in 1973. He also developed fragrances as Empreinte, Courr√®ges Homme, Eau de Courr√®ges, Courr√®ges Blue, Sweet Courr√®ges, and Generation Courr√®ges. At the end of 1970s, Courr√®ges signed licensing agreements for lines of several garments, from shoes to towels. In early 1983, Courr√®ges worked with the Japanese motor company Honda to design special editions of their TACT motor scooter. By 2005, Itokin held the Japanese ready-to-wear license for the Courr√®ges brand, with a retail value of ‚Ç¨50 million. By this point, Madame Courr√®ges had succeeded her husband as artistic director for the brand, Courr√®ges having retired in 1995 following their successful reclamation of the brand in 1994 despite several ownership changes. As of 2012, 50% of the firm's total income was from license royalties. In 2011 Andre and Coqueline Courr√®ges sold the Courr√®ges brand to two advertising executives, Jacques Bungert and Fr√©d√©ric Torloting. After a long absence from Paris Fashion Week, September 2015 saw the presentation of a new Courr√®ges collection designed by new creative directors S√©bastien Meyer and Arnaud Vaillant. Space design Courr√®ge's Spring 1964 collection established his impact on the fashion industry and named him the Space Age designer. The line consisted of \\"architecturally-sculpted, double-breasted coats with contrasting trim, well-tailored, sleeveless or short-sleeved minidresses with dropped waistlines and detailed welt seaming, and tunics worn with hipster pants\\". A notable look was the linear minidresses with revolutionary tailoring with cut-out panels that displayed waists, midriffs and backs. Courr√®ge had strong beliefs within the liberation of fashion. He emphasized that \\"A woman's body must be hard and free, not soft and harnessed. The harness ‚Äì the girdle and bra ‚Äì is the chain of the slave.\\" Which is why his cut-out panel garments were worn without bras. Accessories were inspired by astronauts equipment such as; goggles, helmets and flat boots. White and metallic colour ways were implemented to emphasise the futuristic collection. He utilised unconventional materials such as metal, plastic and PVC which was unusual for couture ateliers. The entire collection was celebrated with British Vogue announced that 1964 was \\"the year of Courr√®ges\\". The New York Times described him as \\"the brightest blaze of the year.\\" to emphasis the change from the little black dress to the white dress. Designers such as Pierre Cardin and Paco Rabanne taking influences towards \\"future\\" fashion looks. With new popularity, his designs trickled down to mass production companies that created affordable designs similar to Courr√®ges. Later life and death Courr√®ges suffered from Parkinson's disease for the last 30 years of his life. He died on 7 January 2016 aged 92, in his Neuilly-sur-Seine outside Paris and was survived by his wife and their daughter. His death was published in notable media outlets and many designers went to celebrate his life online. President Fran√ßois Hollande went to Twitter to say, \\"A revolutionary designer, Andr√© Courr√®ges made his mark on haute couture using geometric shapes and new materials.\\" Courr√®ges was a designer who looked to the future. He predicted the idea of healthy living and toned bodies through his book in 1982.

McKay was best known for hosting ABC's Wide World of Sports (1961‚Äì1998). His introduction for that program has passed into American pop culture, in which viewers were reminded of the show's mission (\\"Spanning the globe to bring you the constant variety of sports\\") and what lay ahead (\\"the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat\\"). He is also known for television coverage of 12 Olympic Games, and is universally respected for his memorable reporting on the Munich massacre at the 1972 Summer Olympics. McKay covered a wide variety of special events, including horse races such as the Kentucky Derby, golf events such as the British Open, and the Indianapolis 500. McKay's son, Sean McManus, a prot√©g√© of Roone Arledge, is the chairman of CBS Sports. Early life McKay was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and raised in the Overbrook section of the city in an Irish American Catholic family. He attended Our Lady of Lourdes Grade School and Saint Joseph's Preparatory School. When McKay was 14, he and his family moved to Baltimore, Maryland, where he attended Loyola High School (now Loyola Blakefield). He received a bachelor's degree from Loyola College in Maryland in 1943. During World War II, he served in the United States Navy as the captain of a minesweeper. In 1946, McKay returned to Baltimore and took a position with The Evening Sun as a police reporter. He was promoted to aviation reporter instead of getting a raise. During this time, he also met Margaret Dempsey, his future wife. Television In 1947, McKay gave up his job as a reporter for The Evening Sun to join that same organization's new TV station WMAR-TV. His was the first voice ever heard on television in Baltimore. McKay remained with the station until joining CBS in New York in 1950 as host of a variety show, called The Real McKay, which necessitated the changing of his on-air surname. From 1958 to 1960, McKay served as host and commentator on the CBS television daytime program The Verdict Is Yours. Through the 1950s, sports commentary became more and more his primary assignment for CBS. In 1956-57, McKay teamed with Chris Schenkel to call CBS telecasts of New York Giants football. He was originally tabbed to be the lead broadcaster of the network's coverage of the 1960 Winter Olympics, but had to be replaced by Walter Cronkite after suffering a mental breakdown. McKay recovered in time to host the 1960 Summer Olympics from the CBS Television studio in Grand Central Terminal. He had a six-episode stint as host of the game show Make the Connection on NBC in 1955. He moved on to ABC in 1961, and was the host of ABC's influential Wide World of Sports for 37 years. McKay was known to motor racing fans as the host of the ABC's annual delayed telecast of the Indianapolis 500. Over the years, McKay worked with race drivers in commentary, including triple Formula One World Champion Jackie Stewart, triple Indy 500 winner Bobby Unser, and Sam Posey. While covering the Munich massacre at the 1972 Summer Olympics for ABC, McKay took on the job of reporting the events live on his only scheduled day off during the Games, substituting for Chris Schenkel. He was on air for fourteen hours without a break, during a sixteen-hour broadcast.Hale, Mark. 5 Questions for Jim McKay. AmericanSportscasterOnline.com. After an unsuccessful rescue attempt of the athletes held hostage, at 3:24 AM German Time, McKay came on the air with this statement: Although McKay received numerous accolades for his reporting of the Munich hostage crisis (including two Emmy Awards, one for sports and one for news reporting), he stated in a 2003 HBO documentary about his life and career that he was most proud of a telegram he received from Walter Cronkite the day after the massacre praising his work. McKay also hosted from the studio the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. A happier result came when the U.S. hockey team defeated the Soviet Union in the Miracle on Ice. During the broadcast wrap-up after the game, McKay compared the American upset victory to a group of Canadian college football players defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers (the recent Super Bowl champions at the height of their dynasty). In 1994, he was the studio host for the FIFA World Cup coverage, the first ever held on American soil. McKay also covered the 2006 FIFA World Cup for ABC. In 2002, ABC \\"loaned\\" McKay to NBC to serve as a special correspondent during the Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City. In 2003, HBO released a documentary by McKay called Jim McKay: My World in My Words, tracing his career. This film outlines McKay's personal and professional accomplishments. Personal life An avid horse racing enthusiast who raised thoroughbreds, McKay founded Maryland Million Day, a series of twelve races designed to promote Maryland's horse breeding industry. The day-long program has grown to become a major racing event in the state of Maryland, second only to the Preakness Stakes day at Pimlico Race Course. It has spawned more than twenty other similar events at United States race tracks such as the Sunshine Millions. McKay and his wife purchased a minority share in the Baltimore Orioles in 1993. He participated in the effort to bring the 2012 Summer Olympics to Baltimore and Washington. McKay died on June 7, 2008, from natural causes at the age of 86. He was survived by his wife Margaret, son Sean, daughter Mary Guba, and three grandchildren. McKay died on the same day as the running of the Belmont Stakes (won by Da'Tara that year).

Background This was Nicholas Sparks' first published novel. It was the third written after The Passing and The Royal Murders, which he did not publish. He wrote it over a period of six months in 1994. Literary agent Theresa Park discovered Sparks by picking the book out of her agency's slush pile and reading it. Park offered to represent him. In October 1995, Park secured a $1 million advance for the book from the Time Warner Book Group, and the novel was published in October 1996. It was on The New York Times Best Seller list in its first week of release. The Notebook was a hardcover best seller for more than a year.Nicholas Sparks Biography In interviews, Sparks said he was inspired to write the novel by the story of his wife's grandparents, who had been married for more than 60 years when he met them. In The Notebook, he tried to express the long romantic love of that couple. Plot The novel opens with Noah Calhoun, an old man, reading to a woman in a nursing home. He tells her the following story: > Noah, 31, returns from World War II to his town of New Bern, North Carolina. > He finishes restoring an antebellum-style house, after his father's death. > Meanwhile, Allie, 29, sees the house in the newspaper and decides to pay him > a visit.

The man stops reading the story at this point, and implies to the audience that he is reading to his wife, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease and does not recognize him. Throughout the story he explains he is also ill, battling a third cancer, and suffering heart disease, kidney failure, and severe arthritis in his hands. He resumes reading the story and describing their life together: her career as a noted painter, their children, growing old together, and finally the diagnosis of Alzheimer's. He had changed the names in the story to protect her, but he is Noah and she is Allie. They walk together and Allie, although she does not recognize him, says she might feel something for him. That night they have dinner together. Referring to the story, she can't quite remember who Allie chose. Recognizing her husband, she tells him that she loves him. They embrace and talk, but after almost four hours, Allie fades. She begins to panic and hallucinate, and forgets who Noah is again. The nurses have to come in and they have to sedate her. Later, Noah has a stroke and cannot visit Allie. When he recovers he goes to visit Allie late at night, as he is staying in the same care home. When Noah tries to sneak past the nurse station, the nurse on duty states that she is going for a coffee, even though she has one on the counter. The nurse also tells Noah she won't be back for a while and not to do anything while she is away. Noah realises it is just a ruse to let him go see Allie, and he goes and finds Allie in bed in her room, asleep. She wakes up, recognizes him as Noah, and tells him that she loves him. They kiss and fall asleep next to each other, believing their love will take them away together. Adaptations In 2004, the novel was adapted into a popular film of the same name starting Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling. A television series based on the novel is also being developed by writer Todd Graff, who will also exec produce along with Sparks and Theresa Park for the Warner Bros. Television and Nicholas Sparks Productions. As of 2019, a musical adaptation of the novel is currently in development, which will premiere on Broadway.

Its supporters suggest that women should relinquish what Doyle deems to be inappropriate control of their husbands and focus on their own happiness in order to bring romance and intimacy back to their relationship.  Philosophy  The author of the core book of this movement maintains that she does not advocate submissiveness or the surrendering of one's self (see contradictions of this claim below); she proposes the surrendering of control over others. Indeed, in Things Will Get as Good as You Can Stand (subtitled When you learn that it is better to receive than to give‚Äì The Superwoman's Practical Guide to Getting as Much as She Gives), Doyle says women turn away praise, validation, and even help to appear to be in control. The author herself writes: The \\"Surrendered Wives\\" movement is centered on six basic principles: # a wife relinquishes control of her husband's life # she respects his decisions for his life # she practices good self-care (she does at least three things a day for her own enjoyment) # she practices expressing gratitude (thanking her husband for the things he does) # a surrendered wife is not afraid to show her vulnerability and take the feminine approach # she trusts him to handle household finances Continuing in an abusive, alcoholic, or adulterous relationship is not promoted or condoned. Having female support is cited by Laura Doyle as a critical component for success for the woman who chooses to surrender. To this end there are a number of trained coaches around the globe who assist women to implement the principles into their lives and marriages. Face to Face group seminars, phone coaching, on-line chat circles and an on-line seminar are available.  Criticism and praise  Her critics see Doyle as advocating that women should be submissive to their husbands. Former Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Sex Discrimination Commissioner Pru Goward compared the movement to slavery saying \\"There is no such thing as an adult who can entirely subvert themselves to another person. That's called slavery and I think we abolished that several hundred years ago.\\" She also claimed that \\"If a man wants that sort of relationship, he actually doesn't want a relationship, he wants a doll. He wants a puppet, he wants total control and that's not the definition of a relationship.\\" Doyle responds that many critics appear to have little knowledge of the principles described in the book and simply react to what they imagine the book says. Supporters argue that taken in balance, the program works for them or even saved their relationships. Sequel The Surrendered Single is a book to help single women attract a good man according to the principles of Surrendering. Doyle advocates the surrender of control of another. A surrendered single is a woman who chooses to apply the principles of surrendering to her life so as to serenely attract a good man rather than desperately seek a mate. Doyle says that the basic principles of a Surrendered Single are that she: *Acknowledges her desire to attract and marry a man who's right for her; *Lets go of the idea of a perfect man; *Receives compliments, gifts, help, and dates graciously whenever possible; *Takes responsibility for and focuses on her own happiness and fulfillment; *Relinquishes control of the pace of the courtship; *Strives to be vulnerable; *Honors her desire to be married by ending dead-end relationships; *Checks for safety before she risks herself physically or emotionally.

She is also the best-known of the last fluent speakers of Cornish. Biography Early life Baptised on 16 May 1692, Pentreath was the second known of six known children of fisherman Nicholas Pentreath and his second wife Jone Pentreath.W. T. Hoblyn, \\"The probable parentage of Dorothy Pentreath\\", in Old Cornwall, 3/11 (1936), pp. 7‚Äì9 She later claimed that she could not speak a word of English until the age of 20. Whether or not this is correct, Cornish was her first language. In old age, she remembered that as a child she had sold fish at Penzance in the Cornish language, which most local inhabitants (even the gentry) then understood.Peter Berresford Ellis, The Cornish language and its literature, pp. 115‚Äì118 online She lived in the parish of Paul, next to Mousehole. Perhaps due to poverty, Pentreath never married, but in 1729 she gave birth to a son, John Pentreath, who lived until 1778. Pentreath is described as having been \\"the old matriarch of the Cornish language [...] Dolly was a Cornish fishwife who tramped her fishy wares around Penwith and Penzance. At the latter place she gained the reputation of being the last native Cornish speaker, though she may not have been. Opinion is also divided about how much Cornish she could actually speak - though everyone agreed she could swear in Cornish.\\" Later years, death, and legacy In 1768, Daines Barrington searched Cornwall for speakers of the language and at Mousehole found Pentreath, then a fish seller said to be aged about 82, who \\"could speak Cornish very fluently.\\" In 1775 he published an account of her in the Society of Antiquaries' journal Archaeologia in an article called \\"On the Expiration of the Cornish Language.\\" Barrington noted that the \\"hut in which she lived was in a narrow lane,\\" and that in two rather better cottages just opposite it he had found two other women, some ten or twelve years younger than Pentreath, who could not speak Cornish readily, but who understood it. Five years later, Pentreath was said to be 87 years old and at the time her hut was \\"poor and maintained mostly by the parish, and partly by fortune telling and gabbling Cornish.\\" In the last years of her life, Pentreath became a local celebrity for her knowledge of Cornish.Barrington, \\"On the expiration of the Cornish language\\", p. 283 Around 1777, she was painted by John Opie (1761‚Äì1807), and in 1781 an engraving of her after Robert Scaddan was published. In 1797, a Mousehole fisherman told Richard Polwhele (1760‚Äì1838) that William Bodinar \\"used to talk with her for hours together in Cornish; that their conversation was understood by scarcely any one of the place; that both Dolly and himself could talk in English.\\"Richard Polwhele, The History of Cornwall, (7 volumes, 1803‚Äì1808), vol. 5, pp. 19‚Äì20 Her own account as recorded by Daines Barrington indicates she also spoke English. Dolly Pentreath has passed into legend for cursing people in a long stream of fierce Cornish whenever she became angry. Her death is seen as marking the death of Cornish as a community language. There are many tales about her. She was said often to curse people, including calling them \\"kronnekyn hager du,\\" an \\"ugly black toad,\\" and was even said to have been a witch. Numerous other stories have been attached to her, their accuracy unknown. She was at one time thought to have been identical with a Dorothy Jeffrey or Jeffery whose burial is recorded in the Paul parish register, but this has been doubted (however the Oxford DNB (2004) does accept the identification). Monument alt=A grey granite monument set into a stone wall of a church Dolly Pentreath was buried at Paul, where in 1860 a monument in her honour was set into the churchyard wall of the church of St Paul Aurelian by Louis Lucien Bonaparte, a nephew of Napoleon, and by the Vicar of Paul of the time. It read: Contradicting the monument, in 1882 Dr Frederick Jago of Plymouth received a letter from Bernard Victor, of Mousehole, who wrote \\"She died Decr. 26, 1777, at the age of 102. At her funeral the undertaker was George Badcock. He being my grandfather, that is the reason I am so well informed ; and there were eight chosen fishermen bearers to take her to her last resting place. There was not anything erected on the old lady's grave as a tablet to her memory. I know quite well the grave where her remains are deposited.\\" In a later letter he went on to say that it was no surprise that Bonaparte and Garret had mistaken both the date and the place of the grave. \\"Dolly's actual resting place is 47 feet south-east, a point easterly from Prince L. L. Bonaparte's monument to her. It is not to be said that the monument is in its right place, because it was put there by the order of Prince L. L. Bonaparte, or by the Rev. John Garrett ‚Äì the one a Frenchman and the other an Irishman!\\"Fred. W. P. Jago, The Ancient Language, and the Dialect of Cornwall (Truro: Netherton & Worth, 1882), pp. 336‚Äì337 However, the erroneous idea that Pentreath had lived to be 102 is believed to originate in a Cornish language epitaph which had been written by December 1789 and published in 1806 by a man named Tomson. No burial of Dorothy Pentreath is recorded, but it has been argued that this appears in the parish register under the name of Dolly Jeffery, which is suggested to be the surname of her son's father. This theory is accepted by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. In 1887, the monument was moved to the site of her unmarked grave, and a skeleton was disinterred which was believed to be hers. P√™r-Jakez Helias, the Breton writer, has dedicated a poem to Dolly Pentreath. Last Cornish speaker As with many other \\"last native speakers,\\" there is controversy over Pentreath's status. Her true claim to notability is not as the last speaker of the language, but rather as its last fluent native speaker. After her death, Barrington received a letter, written in Cornish and accompanied by an English translation, from a fisherman in Mousehole named William Bodinar (or Bodener) stating that he knew of five people who could speak Cornish in that village alone. Barrington also speaks of a John Nancarrow from Marazion who was a native speaker and survived into the 1790s.Ellis, P. Berresford, The Story of the Cornish Language (Truro: Tor Mark Press, 1971)Ellis, P. Berresford (1974) The Cornish Language and its Literature. London: Routledge & Kegan Paul There is one known traditional Cornish speaker, John Mann, who as a child in Boswednack, Zennor, always conversed in Cornish with other children, and was alive at the age of 80 in 1914. He was the last known survivor of a number of traditional Cornish speakers of the 19th century including Jacob Care of St Ives (d. 1892); Elizabeth Vingoe of Higher Boswarva, Madron (d. 1903 and who taught at least some Cornish to her son); John Davey junior (d. 1891) and senior, of Boswednack; Anne Berryman (1766‚Äì1854), also of Boswednack.Rod Lyon, Cornish ‚Äì The Struggle for Survival, 2001 Matthias Wallis of St. Buryan certified in 1859 that his grandmother, Ann Wallis, who had died around 1844, had spoken Cornish well.

In some American exchange designs, for example, the No. 1 Crossbar switch there were both originating senders and terminating senders pp. 34, 41. The corresponding device in the British director telephone system was called a \\"director\\" and, in other contexts, \\"register\\".  History  The sender concept was developed to meet the needs of large city telephone switching systems, where the total number of subscriber lines and multiple central offices throughout the city required complex switching arrangements that were not easily handled by the direct control systems then in use, such as the step by step, or Strowger system. These limitations included inefficient trunking in large service areas, and a limited ability for growth and reorganization as additional subscribers were added. The introduction of senders into switching systems allowed the subscriber's dial pulses to be registered, then translated into a physical location on the switching fabric, either in the local office, or in a distant office. Once the sender received the translation, it directed the selectors in the switching fabric to the correct terminal, completing the connection to the called party. Because the dialed digits from the subscriber were stored, and translated, there was no direct correlation required between the dialed number, and the actual location of the trunk(s) or subscribers on the switch itself. This meant that as new telephone exchanges were added, a translation could be updated to include the new exchange without expensive and time-consuming modifications to the telephone switch. One of the first US patents filed for this concept was granted to Western Electric in 1913. This was developed in the US by the Bell System and was first widely used in the Panel Machine Switching System. As machine switching exchanges became commonplace, senders also played a critical role in communication between central offices of different types. For example, in a given city, there may be several central offices with different kinds of telephone switches that all must inter-operate with each other. As technology improved, better signaling methods were devised, but backward compatibility with existing exchanges had to be maintained. Thus, senders were developed to send and receive information in a wide variety of \\"protocols\\", including revertive pulse, MF, dial pulse, DC key pulse, and PCI. The sender design was improved throughout the 20th Century and was used extensively in the No. 1 and No. 5 Crossbar switching systems. Common-channel signaling replaced senders after the advent of stored program control. A secondary meaning within the UK broadcast engineering community is as a synonym for broadcast transmitter.

Early life  Jack Butler was born on 4 May 1901 at Wilukampal (also known as Caraline Creek and Caraline Well), an outcamp near Moroonah Station in northwestern Western Australia. His mother, called Silver in English, was a Tharrkari woman who worked as a cook at the outcamp. His father was Dick Butler, a white shepherd who moved to Darwin. His stepfather, Jinapuka, also known as Yawartawari, was a Warriyangka man. In 1905 or 1906 Butler and his family moved to Glennflorrie Station, where he helped to look after male elders. In 1923 the family moved to Gifford Creek Station on the West Lyons River. In 1926 Butler moved to Mount Stuart Station and in 1927 he married Molly Ashburton, a Thalanyji woman. They had four children ‚Äì Paul, Maggie, Sid and Claude ‚Äì between 1928 and 1938.  Jiwarli language  With his younger brother Joe Butler, Jack Butler was one of the last speakers of the Jiwarli dialect and contributed to its study and documentation. Between 1978 and 1986 he collaborated with linguist Peter Austin to document Jiwarli history, language and culture, and to create a Jiwarli dictionary and story collection. Butler and Austin recorded more than 70 texts and a lexicon of around 1500 words, as well as related linguistic recordings. Butler's recordings provide one of the only audio documentations of Jiwarli. In 1985 he recounted two stories from his childhood to Austin in Jiwarli. One story describes an earthquake in about 1906. The other describes the appearance of Halley's Comet in 1910. The stories are culturally, linguistically and historically significant, as they provide evidence that traditional Jiwarli cultural and family life were relatively intact when Butler was a child. According to Austin, although white colonisation of the area began in the 1860s, it was not until the expansion of the Western Australian pearling industry and its forced labour system in the 1920s that traditional Jiwarli life was \\"irreparably disrupted\\".

Of African-American ancestry, Red Thunder Cloud presented himself as Native American throughout most of his life. Anthropologist Frank Speck believed Red Thunder Cloud to be a genuine Catawba Indian and proceeded to provide him with training in field methods of recording notes for ethnological studies. Despite the fact that he became fluent in the Catawba language, Red Thunder Cloud was neither Catawba nor Native American by ancestry. He worked for Speck, collecting ethnographic data and folklore from Native American groups, and collaborated with several other academic experts on Native American cultures and languages. Early life Red Thunder Cloud was born on May 30, 1919, as Cromwell Ashbie Hawkins West in Newport, Rhode Island to Cromwell Payne West of Pennsylvania and Roberta Hawkins West of Lynchburg, Virginia. Both were of African American descent. His maternal grandfather was William Ashbie Hawkins, one of the first African- American lawyers in Baltimore. From 1935 to 1937 West was employed by the Newport City wharf as a watchman and later as a chauffeur. In 1938 West began correspondence with Frank G. Speck, a professor of anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania, claiming that he was a sixteen-year-old Catawba Indian. He asked Speck for help in learning more about his people and told him that he had been interested in Native American culture since the fourth grade. He claimed that he was raised by the Narragansett tribe of Rhode Island and had lived with the Shinnecock tribe since 1937. He also claimed that he learned the Catawba language from his grandmother, Ada McMechen. Red Thunder Cloud identity For reasons that are unclear, West reinvented his identity at this point and lived the rest of his life as Red Thunder Cloud of the Catawba tribe. Speck believed Red Thunder Cloud to be a genuine Catawba Indian and proceeded to provide him with training in field methods of recording notes for ethnological studies. Red Thunder Cloud worked for Speck on small projects, collecting ethnographic data and folklore among Long Island Indians. He also collected data on the Montauk, Shinnecock, and Mashpee tribes for George Gustav Heye, founder of what became the National Museum of the American Indian. In December 1943, Red Thunder Cloud lived at the University of Pennsylvania for two weeks, providing information on the Catawba tribe, recording music, and aiding in ethnobotanical research. Red Thunder Cloud made his first visit to the Catawba Reservation in Rock Hill, South Carolina, in February 1944. According to Chief Gilbert Blue of the Catawba tribe, Red Thunder Cloud studied with his grandfather, Chief Sam Blue, and Sally Gordon during his second visit to the reservation, which lasted for six months. When interviewed in 1957 by William C. Sturtevant, Chief Sam Blue and his daughter- in-law Lillian expressed doubts concerning Red Thunder Cloud's identity as a Catawba. They believed that he had originally learned the language from a book. In a letter dated October 25, 1958, Red Thunder Cloud offered assistance to Sturtevant in making contact with Indian groups in the eastern United States. His correspondence claimed that his mother was Catawba and his father was from Tegucigalpa, Honduras, and came from Honduran and Puerto Rican parentage. Red Thunder Cloud also stated that he spoke Spanish and Portuguese as well as Native American languages including Cayuga, Seneca, Mohawk, Narraganset, Micmac, Passamaquoddy, Penobscot, Creek, Choctaw, Sioux, and Winnebago. In addition, he claimed he was able to recognize other Indian languages when he heard them spoken. Foxx Ayers, a longtime Catawba friend of Red Thunder Cloud, stated that his friend's knowledge of the language was so good that he had trained his dog to answer only to Catawba commands. Marriage Red Thunder Cloud was briefly married to Jean Marilyn Miller (Pretty Pony) of the Blackfoot tribe. Support of Native American causes Red Thunder Cloud's support of Native American causes was demonstrated by his involvement in Indian organizations, as well as his publication of a periodical in the late 1940s called The Indian War Drum: The Voice of the Eastern Indians. In 1964 and 1965 he worked with G. Hubert Matthews, professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to document the Catawba language. Together they published five texts in 1967. Matthews included in these books Red Thunder Cloud's family genealogy and named the Catawba relatives in his maternal line. In discussions with Matthews, Red Thunder Cloud gave the name of his mother's father as ‚ÄúStrong Eagle.‚Äù The latter was a graduate of Yale Law School, Red Thunder Cloud said, and had died in 1941. He identified his mother's name as ‚ÄúSinging Dove.‚Äù Death Red Thunder Cloud died at St. Vincent's Hospital in Worcester, Massachusetts following a stroke, at the age of 76. At the time of his death, Leonor Pena, a close friend from Central Falls, Rhode Island, gave Red Thunder Cloud's name as Carlos Westez and included the alias Namos S. Hatiririe. She listed his occupation as shaman. His sister, as administrator to his will in probate court, gave his name as Cromwell Ashbie Hawkins West. Investigation of identity Linguist and ethnologist Ives Goddard of the Smithsonian Institution has validated suspicions of Red Thunder Cloud's identity by way of public documents, letters, and publications. He stated that \\"in spite of the negative issues surrounding Red Thunder Cloud's identity, he has made valuable contributions to the study of ethnography\\". Goddard stated that even though Red Thunder Cloud's life was a \\"successful life-long masquerade\\", he contributed extensively to a greater understanding and protection of the Catawba and other native cultures. A historian specializing in the Catawba, Wes Taukchiray, said \\"What I'm interested in is that he learned how to speak the Catawba language conversationally.\\" Taukchiray also said, \\"I'm not really concerned about his ethnic origin.\\" Bibliography *The Shinnecock Indians of Long Island [a collection of photographs] (1963) *The Montauk Indians of Long Island in New York State [a collection of photographs] (1975) Discography *A Child's Introduction To The American Indian (1963) *Songs and Legends of the Catawba (1992) *Songs and Traditions of the Catawba (1992)  References  Impostors 1919 births 1996 deaths ","title":"Red Thunder Cloud"},{"id":"714258","text":"The Catawba, also known as Issa, Essa or Isw√§ but most commonly Iswa (Catawba: Iswa ‚Äì \\"people of the river\\"), are a federally recognized tribe of Native Americans, known as the Catawba Indian Nation. They live in the Southeastern United States, on the Catawba River at the border of North Carolina, near the city of Rock Hill, South Carolina. They were once considered one of the most powerful Southeastern Siouan-speaking tribes in the Carolina Piedmont, as well as one of the most powerful tribes in the South as a whole. The Catawba were among the East Coast tribes who made selective alliances with some of the early European colonists, when these colonists agreed to help them in their ongoing conflicts with other tribes in the region. These were primarily the tribes of different language families: the Iroquois, who ranged south from the Great Lakes area and New York; the Algonquian Shawnee and Lenape (Delaware); and the Iroquoian Cherokee, who fought for control over the large Ohio Valley (including what is in present-day West Virginia).Sultzman, Lee. Catawba History. Clay Hound: Native American Traditional Pottery. (retrieved 14 March 2009) During the American Revolutionary War the Catawba supported the American colonists against the British. Decimated by colonial smallpox epidemics, warfare and cultural disruption, the Catawba declined markedly in number in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Some Catawba continued to live in their homelands in South Carolina, while others joined the Choctaw or Cherokee, at least temporarily. Terminated as a tribe by the federal government in 1959, the Catawba Indian Nation had to reorganize to reassert their sovereignty and treaty rights. In 1973 they established their tribal enrollment and began the process of regaining federal recognition. In 1993 their federal recognition was re-established, along with a $50 million settlement by the federal government and state of South Carolina tor their longstanding land claims. The tribe was also officially recognized by the state of South Carolina in 1993. Their headquarters are at Rock Hill, South Carolina. , the population of the Catawba Nation has increased to about 2600, most in South Carolina, with smaller groups in Oklahoma, Colorado, Ohio, and elsewhere. The Catawban language, which is being revived, is part of the Siouan family (Catawban branch).William C. Sturtevant, \\"Siouan Languages in the East\\", American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol. 60, No. 4 (Aug 1958), pp. 738‚Äì743 (retrieved through Jstor.org, 14 March 2009) History A English copy of a deerskin Catawba map of the tribes between Charleston (left) and Virginia (right) following the displacements of a century of disease and enslavement and the 1715‚Äì7 Yamasee War. The Catawba themselves are labelled as \\"Nasaw\\". From the earliest period, the Catawba have also been known as Esaw, or Issa (Catawba isw√§, \\"river\\"), from their residence on the principal stream of the region. They called both the present-day Catawba and Wateree rivers Iswa. The Iroquois frequently included them under the general term Totiri, or Toderichroone, also known as Tutelo. The Iroquois collectively used this term to apply to all the southern Siouan-speaking tribes. Albert Gallatin (1836) classified the Catawba as a separate, distinct group among Siouan tribes. When the linguist Albert Samuel Gatschet visited them in 1881 and obtained a large vocabulary showing numerous correspondences with Siouan, linguists classified them with the Siouan-speaking peoples. Further investigations by Horatio Hale, Gatschet, James Mooney, and James Owen Dorsey proved that several tribes of the same region were also of Siouan stock. In the late nineteenth century, the ethnographer Henry Rowe Schoolcraft wrote that the Catawba had lived in Canada until driven out by the Iroquois (supposedly with French help), and that they had migrated to Kentucky and to Botetourt County, Virginia. He asserted that by 1660 they had migrated south to the Catawba River, contesting it with the Cherokee in the area. But, 20th-century anthropologist James Mooney later dismissed most elements of Schoolcraft's record as \\"absurd, the invention and surmise of the would-be historian who records the tradition.\\" He pointed out that, aside from the French never having been known to help the Iroquois, the Catawba had been recorded by 1567 in the same area of the Catawba River as their later territory. Mooney accepted the tradition that the Catawba and Cherokee had made the Broad River their mutual boundary, following a protracted struggle.Mooney, Siouan Tribes of the East p. 69. The Catawba were long in a state of conflict with several northern tribes, particularly the Iroquois Seneca, and the Algonquian-speaking Lenape. The Catawba chased Lenape raiding parties back to the north in the 1720s and 1730s, going across the Potomac River. At one point, a party of Catawba is said to have followed a party of Lenape who attacked them, and to have overtaken them near Leesburg, Virginia. There they fought a pitched battle.Legends of Loudoun, Harrison Williams, p. 63‚Äì64 Similar encounters in these longstanding conflicts were reported to have occurred at present-day Franklin, West Virginia (1725),Frederic Morton, The Story of Winchester in Virginia p. 38 Hanging Rocks and the mouth of the Potomac South Branch in West Virginia, and near the mouths of Antietam Creek (1736) and Conococheague Creek in Maryland.Joseph Doddridge, 1850, A History of the Valley of Virginia, pp. 29‚Äì33. Mooney asserted that the name of Catawba Creek in Botetourt came from an encounter in these battles with the northern tribes, not from the Catawba having lived there. The colonial governments of Virginia and New York held a council at Albany, New York in 1721, attended by delegates from the Six Nations (Haudenosaunee) and the Catawba. The colonists asked for peace between the Confederacy and the Catawba, however the Six Nations reserved the land west of the Blue Ridge mountains for themselves, including the Indian Road or Great Warriors' Path (later called the Great Wagon Road) through the Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia backcountry. This heavily traveled path, used until 1744 by Seneca war parties, went through the Shenandoah Valley to the South. In 1738, a smallpox epidemic broke out in South Carolina. It caused many deaths, not only among the Anglo-Americans, but especially among the Catawba and other tribes, such as the Sissipahaw. They had no natural immunity to the disease, which had been endemic in Europe for centuries. In 1759, a smallpox epidemic killed nearly half the tribe. Native Americans suffered high fatalities from such infectious Eurasian diseases. In 1744 the Treaty of Lancaster, made at Lancaster, Pennsylvania, renewed the Covenant Chain between the Iroquois and the colonists. The governments had not been able to prevent settlers going into Iroquois territory, but the governor of Virginia offered the tribe payment for their land claim. The peace was probably final for the Iroquois, who had established the Ohio Valley as their preferred hunting ground by right of conquest. The more western tribes continued warfare against the Catawba, who were so reduced that they could raise little resistance. In 1763, a small party of Algonquian Shawnee killed the noted Catawba chief, King Hagler, near his own village.Thomas J. Blumer, Robert P. Smith, E. Fred Sanders. Catawba Nation: Treasures in History, American Heritage, Arcadia Publishing, 2007. In 1763, South Carolina confirmed a reservation for the Catawba of , on both sides of the Catawba River, within the present York and Lancaster counties. When British troops approached during the American Revolutionary War in 1780, the Catawba withdrew temporarily into Virginia. They returned after the Battle of Guilford Court House, and settled in two villages on the reservation. These were known as Newton, the principal village, and Turkey Head, on opposite sides of Catawba River. 19th century In 1826, the Catawba leased nearly half their reservation to whites for a few thousand dollars of annuity, on which the few survivors (as few as 110 by one estimate) chiefly depended. In 1840 by the Treaty of Nation Ford with South Carolina, the Catawba sold all but of their reserved by the King of England to the state. They resided on the remaining square mile after the treaty. The treaty was invalid ab initio because the state did not have the right to make it and did not get federal approval.Steven Paul McSloy, \\"Revisiting the \\"Courts of the Conqueror:\\" American Indian Claims Against the United States\\", American University Law Review, Vol. 44:537, 1994, p. 549 About the same time, a number of the Catawba, dissatisfied with their condition among the whites, removed to join the eastern Cherokee in western North Carolina. But, finding their position among their old enemies equally unpleasant, all but one or two soon returned to South Carolina. An old woman, the last survivor of this emigration, died among the Cherokee in 1889. A few Cherokee intermarried with the Catawba. At a later period some Catawba removed to the Choctaw Nation in Indian Territory and settled near present-day Scullyville, Oklahoma. They merged with the Choctaw and did not retain separate tribal identity. Rock Hill Historical culture The Catawba were sedentary agriculturists, who also fished and hunted for game. They had customs similar to neighboring Native Americans in the Piedmont. The men were good hunters. The women have been noted makers of pottery and baskets, arts which they still preserve. They seem to have practiced the custom of head- flattening to a limited extent, as did several of the neighboring tribes. By reason of their dominant position, the Catawba had gradually absorbed the broken tribes of South Carolina, to the number, according to Adair, of perhaps 20. Early Spanish explorers estimated their population between 15,000 and 25,000 people. When the English first settled South Carolina about 1682, they estimated the Catawba at about 1,500 warriors, or about 4,600 people in total because of the diseases that the English carried. They named the Catawba River and Catawba County after the indigenous people. By 1728, the Catawba had been reduced to about 400 warriors, or about 1400 persons in total. In 1738, they suffered from a smallpox epidemic, which also affected nearby tribes and the whites. In 1743, even after incorporating several small tribes, the Catawba numbered fewer than 400 warriors. In 1759, they again suffered from smallpox, and in 1761, had some 300 warriors, or about 1,000 people. By 1775 they had only 400 people in total; in 1780, they had 490; and, in 1784, only 250 were reported. During the nineteenth century, their numbers continued to decline, to 450 in 1822, and a total of 110 people in 1826. As of 2006, their population had increased to about 2600. = Religion and culture = The Catawba women are well known for their pottery in the Carolinas. The customs and beliefs of the early Catawba were documented by the anthropologist Frank Speck in the twentieth century. In the Carolinas, the Catawba became well known for their pottery, which has historically been made primarily by the women, but is now also made by some of the men, as well.Catawba Indian Pottery The Survival of a Folk Tradition. Thomas John Blumer Contemporary American Indian Studies. J. Anthony Paredes, Series Editor. In approximately 1883, tribal members were contacted by missionaries of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Numerous Catawba were converted to the church, and some migrated to Colorado and Utah and neighboring western states.Encyclopedia of Latter-day Saint History, p. 1165 The Catawba hold a yearly celebration called Yap Ye Iswa, which roughly translates to Day of the People, or Day of the River People. Held at the Catawba Cultural Center, proceeds are used to fund the activities of the center. 20th century to present A Catawba family in 1908 South Carolina. The Catawba were electing their chief prior to the start of the 20th century. In 1909 the Catawba sent a petition to the United States government seeking to be given United States citizenship.Blummer, The Catawba Nation (Historians Press, 2007), p. 101 During the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration, the federal government worked to improve conditions for Native Americans. Under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, tribes were encouraged to renew their governments for more self-determination. The Catawba were not at that time a recognized Native American tribe. In 1929 the Chief of the Catawba, Samuel Taylor Blue, had begun the process to gain federal recognition. The Catawba were recognized as a Native American tribe in 1941 and they created a written constitution in 1944. Also in 1944 South Carolina granted the Catawba and other Native American residents of the state citizenship, but not to the extent of granting them the right to vote. Like African Americans, they were largely excluded from the franchise. That right would be denied to the Catawba until the 1960s, when they gained it as a result of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which provided for federal enforcement of people's constitutional right to vote. As a result of the federal government's Indian termination policy in the 1950s of its special relationship with some Indian tribes that it determined were ready for assimilation, it terminated the government of the Catawba in 1959. This meant also that the members of the tribe ceased to have federal benefits, their assets were divided, and the people were subject to state law. The Catawba found that they preferred to be organized as a tribal community. Beginning in 1973, they applied to have their government federally recognized, with Gilbert Blue serving as their chief until 2007. They adopted a constitution in 1975 that was modeled on their 1944 version. In addition, for decades the Catawba pursued various land claims against the government for the losses due to the illegal treaty made by South Carolina in 1840 and the failure of the federal government to protect their interests. On October 27, 1993, the U.S. Congress enacted the Catawba Indian Tribe of South Carolina Land Claims Settlement Act of 1993 (Settlement Act), which reversed the \\"termination\\", recognized the Catawba Indian Nation and, together with the state of South Carolina, settled the land claims for $50 million to go toward economic development for the Nation.McSloy, \\"Revisiting the \\"Courts of the Conqueror:\\" American Indian Claims Against the United States\\", 1994, p. 552 On July 21, 2007, the Catawba held their first elections in more than 30 years. Of the five members of the former government, only two were reelected.\\"New Catawba leader faces uphill climb\\", Indian Country, 13 Aug 2007 In the 2010 census, 3,370 people claimed Catawba ancestry. Catawba Indian Nation Land Trust The Catawba Reservation (), located in two disjoint sections in York County, South Carolina east of Rock Hill; a total of , it reported a 2010 census population of 841 inhabitants. It also has a congressionally established service area in North Carolina, covering Mecklenburg, Cabarrus, Gaston, Union, Cleveland and Rutherford counties. The Catawba also owns a site in Kings Mountain, North Carolina, which will be used for a casino and mixed-use entertainment complex. Today the Catawba earns most of its revenue from Federal/State funds. Gaming relations with South Carolina Under the terms of the 1993 Settlement Act, the Catawba waived its right to be governed by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. Instead, the Catawba agreed to be governed by the terms of the Settlement Agreement and the State Act as pertains to games of chance; which at the time allowed for video poker and bingo. In 1996, the Catawba formed a joint venture partnership with D.T. Collier of SPM Resorts, Inc. of Myrtle Beach, to manage their bingo and casino operations. That partnership, New River Management and Development Company, LLC (of which the Catawba were the majority owner) operated the Catawba's bingo parlor in Rock Hill. In 1999, the South Carolina General Assembly passed a statewide ban on the possession and operation of video poker devices. When in 2004 the Catawba entered into an exclusive management contract with SPM Resorts, Inc., to manage all new bingo facilities, some tribal members were critical. The new contract was signed by the former governing body immediately prior to new elections. In addition, the contract was never brought before the General Council (the full tribal membership) as required by their existing constitution.\\"Tribal members protest Catawba Bingo\\" , Indian Country, 6 Apr 2004 After the state established the South Carolina Education Lottery in 2002, the tribe lost gambling revenue and decided to shut down the Rock Hill bingo operation. They sold the facility in 2007.\\"The lottery at 5 years: Tribe says lottery killed its business\\" , The State, 18 Dec 2007 In 2006, the bingo parlor, located at the former Rock Hill Mall on Cherry Road, was closed. The Catawba filed suit against the state of South Carolina for the right to operate video poker and similar \\"electronic play\\" devices on their reservation. They prevailed in the lower courts, but the state appealed the ruling to the South Carolina Supreme Court. The state Supreme Court overturned the lower court ruling. The tribe appealed that ruling to the United States Supreme Court, but in 2007 the court declined to hear the appeal. In 2014, similar decision was handed by the Supreme Court of South Carolina in regards of the state's Gambling Cruise Act. In 2014, the Catawba made a second attempt with bingo, opening a parlor, site formally a BI-LO, on Cherry Road in Rock Hill. It closed in 2017, unable to turn a profit. Gaming relations with North Carolina On September 9, 2013, the Catawba announced plans to build a $600 million casino along Interstate 85 in Kings Mountain, North Carolina. Cleveland County officials quickly endorsed the plans; while Governor Pat McCrory, over 100 North Carolina General Assembly members and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (EBCI) opposed it. Submitting a mandatory acquisition application to the United States Department of the Interior (DOI) in August 2013 to place the site in trust, the application was denied in March 2018. In September, the Catawba submitted a new application under the discretionary process; they also pursued a legislative route, senate bill 790, introduced by South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, with support of North Carolina Senators Thom Tillis and Richard Burr, would have authorized the DOI to take the land into trust for gaming, but the bill died in committee. On March 13, 2020, the DOI announced its decision to approve the 2018 discretionary application and place the land in North Carolina in trust. On March 17, the EBCI filed a suit in the U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia against the Federal Government. The suit names the DOI, the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs, Secretary David Bernhardt, and several other department officials. In addition, the Catawba filed a motion to intervene to join the defendants, while the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma also filed a motion to support the EBCI; both motions were approved. In May, the EBCI filed an amended complaint in its federal lawsuit, indicating the DOI's acquisition of land was a result a scheme by casino developer Wallace Cheves, who prevailed upon the Catawba Indian Nation of South Carolina to lend its name to a scheme and who has a history of criminal and civil enforcement actions against him and his companies for illegal gambling. It also included the DOI disregard of early consultation with the EBCI and it was rushed skipping a Environmental Impact Assessment. The Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma also filed its own amended complaint, seeking to protect cultural artifacts on their ancestral land where the casino is planned.

The most common type of IOL is the pseudophakic IOL. These are implanted during cataract surgery, after the cloudy eye's natural lens (colloquially called a cataract) has been removed. The pseudophakic IOL provides the same light focusing function as the natural crystalline lens. The second type of IOL, more commonly known as a phakic intraocular lens (PIOL), is a lens which is placed over the existing natural lens and is used in refractive surgery to change the eye's optical power as a treatment for myopia (nearsightedness). IOLs usually consist of a small plastic lens with plastic side struts, called haptics, to hold the lens in place in the capsular bag inside the eye. IOLs were conventionally made of an inflexible material (PMMA), although this has largely been superseded by the use of flexible materials, such as silicone and acrylic glass. Most IOLs fitted today are fixed monofocal lenses matched to distance vision. However, other types are available, such as multifocal IOLs that provide the patient with multiple- focused vision at far and reading distance, and adaptive IOLs that provide the patient with limited visual accommodation. Surgeons annually implant more than 6 million lenses. The procedure can be done under local anesthesia with the patient awake throughout the operation. The use of a flexible IOL enables the lens to be rolled for insertion into the capsule through a very small incision, thus avoiding the need for stitches. This procedure usually takes less than 30 minutes in the hands of an experienced ophthalmologist. The recovery period is about 2‚Äì3 weeks. After surgery, patients should avoid strenuous exercise or anything else that significantly increases blood pressure. They should visit their ophthalmologists regularly for several months to monitor the implants. IOL implantation carries several risks associated with eye surgeries, such as infection, loosening of the lens, lens rotation, inflammation and nighttime halos, but a systematic review of studies has determined that the procedure is safer than conventional laser eye treatment. Though IOLs enable many patients to have reduced dependence on glasses, most patients still rely on glasses for certain activities, such as reading. Medical uses Intraocular lenses have been used since 1999 for correcting larger errors in near-sighted, far-sighted, and astigmatic eyes. This type of IOL is also called phakic intraocular lens (PIOL), as it is implantated without removing the patient's natural crystalline lens. Phakic IOL appear to be less dangerous than excimer laser surgery (LASIK) in those with significant nearsightedness. More commonly IOLS are implanted via Clear Lens Extraction And Replacement (CLEAR) surgery. During CLEAR, the crystalline lens is extracted and an IOL replaces it in a process that is very similar to cataract surgery: both involve lens replacement, local anesthesia, last approximately 30 minutes, and require making a small incision in the eye for lens insertion. People recover from CLEAR surgery 1‚Äì7 days after the operation. During this time, they should avoid strenuous exercise or anything else that significantly raises blood pressure. They should visit their ophthalmologists regularly for several months to monitor the IOL implants. CLEAR has a 90% success rate (risks include wound leakage, infection, inflammation, and astigmatism). CLEAR can be performed only on patients ages 40 and older. This is to ensure that eye growth, which disrupts IOL lenses, will not occur post-surgery. Once implanted, IOL lenses have three major benefits. First, they are an alternative to the excimer laser procedure (LASIK), a form of eye surgery that does not work for people with serious vision problems. Effective IOL implants also entirely eliminate the need for glasses or contact lenses post-surgery for most patients. The cataract will not return, as the lens has been removed. The disadvantage is that the eye's ability to change focus (accommodate) has generally been reduced or eliminated, depending on the kind of lens implanted. Some of the risks that FDA have been found so far during a three-year study of the Artisan are: * a yearly loss of 1.8% of the endothelial cells, * 0.6% risk of retinal detachment, * 0.6% risk of cataract (other studies have shown a risk of 0.5 ‚Äì 1.0%), and * 0.4% risk of corneal swelling. Other risks include: * 0.03‚Äì0.05% eye infection risk, which in worst case can lead to blindness. This risk exists in all eye surgery procedures and is not unique for IOLs. * glaucoma, * astigmatism, * remaining near or far sightedness, * rotation of the lens inside the eye one or two days after surgery. One of the causes of the risks above is that the lens can rotate inside the eye if the PIOL is too short, if the eye was incorrectly measured, or because the sulcus has a slightly oval shape (the height is slightly smaller than the width). Toric IOLs must be powered and aligned inside the eye on a meridian that corrects the patient's preexisting astigmatism. Again, these lenses can rotate inside the eye postoperatively or be placed incorrectly by the operating surgeon. Either way, the patient's preexisting astigmatism may not be corrected completely or may even increase. When standard IOLs are implanted with a CLEAR procedure, in substitution of the patient's crystalline, astigmatism is typically not corrected, as astigmatism is mainly attributable to a deformation of the cornea. Toric IOLs may be used during the CLEAR procedure to correct astigmatism. The surgeon can ascertain the astigmatic, or steepest, meridian in a number of ways, including manifest refraction or corneal topography. Manifest refraction is the familiar test where the eye doctor rotates lenses in front of the eye, asking the patient, \\"Which is better (or clearer), this one or this one?\\" Corneal topography is considered a more quantitative test, and for purposes of aligning a toric IOL, most surgeons use a measurement called simulated keratometry (SimK), which is calculated by the internal programming of the corneal topography machine, to determine the astigmatic meridian on the surface of the cornea. The astigmatic meridian can also be identified using corneal wavefront technology or paraxial curvature matching. Type of surgery  Implants with or without removal of natural crystalline  * Phakia is the presence of the natural crystalline lenses. Phakic IOL (PIOL) refers to an intraocular lens implanted without removal of the patient's original crystalline lens, and this is performed solely to correct refractive error in the presence of a clear crystalline lens. * Aphakia is the absence of the natural crystalline lens. The aphakic state is usually due to surgery to remove a cataractous lens, but post-surgical aphakia is rare nowadays because of the ubiquity of intraocular lenses. Rarely, aphakia can be post-traumatic or congenital in nature. Aphakic IOL refers to a lens implanted secondarily in an eye already aphakic from previous surgery or trauma some time ago. * Pseudophakia is the substitution of the natural crystalline lens with an IOL, as is often done after cataract extraction or to correct refractive error. Pseudophakic IOL refers to a lens implanted during cataract surgery, immediately after removal of the patient's crystalline lens. Many aphakic and pseudophakic IOLs such as anterior chamber IOLs or 3 piece posterior chamber IOLs can be used interchangeably. The exception are one piece IOLs, which must be placed within the capsular bag at the time of cataract surgery and hence cannot be used as secondary implants. Location of implant Before surgery (natural crystalline lens, left). After surgery (implanted PCIOL, right). An anterior chamber IOL (ACIOL) * Posterior chamber IOL (PCIOL). This is by far the most common type of implanted lens after cataract surgery in the United States. * Anterior chamber IOL (ACIOL). A less- common type of intraocular lens, which is sometimes used if a PCIOL is not an option for a patient or if the situation requires a phakic IOL (PIOL). Pseudophakic IOLs Pseudophakic IOLs are lenses implanted during cataract surgery, immediately after removal of the patient's crystalline lens. Monofocal Monofocal IOLs are standard lenses used in cataract surgery. One of the major disadvantages of these conventional IOLs is that they can only be focussed for one particular distance - either optical infinity (rendering the eye emmetropic) or a fixed finite distance (rendering the eye myopic). Patients that undergo a standard IOL implantation no longer experience clouding from cataracts, but they are unable to accommodate (change focus from near to far, far to near, and to distances in between). This is not a concern for most cataract surgeries, as they are primarily performed on elderly people that are already completely presbyopic. However, it can be a problem for patients that are not yet presbyopic (or are in the early stages of presbyopia) undergoing refractive lens exchange for the sake of correcting refractive errors. Monovision, in which one eye is made emmetropic and the other myopic, can partially compensate for the loss of accommodation and enable clear vision at multiple distances. More versatile types of lenses (multifocal and accommodating IOLs) were introduced in 2003 in the United States, with the approval by the Food and Drug Administration. These come at an additional cost to the recipient beyond what Medicare will pay and each has advantages and disadvantages. Multifocal Multifocal IOLs attempt to provide simultaneous viewing of distance vision and near vision. Trifocal IOLs can provide intermediate vision. Many multifocal IOL designs attempt to achieve this simultaneous viewing focus using a concentric ring design, which alternates distance and near focal points. However, many concentric ring multifocal lenses used today are prone to glare and mildly compromised focus at all ranges of vision. People who have a multifocal IOL after their cataract is removed may be less likely to need additional glasses compared with people who have standard monofocal lenses. However, people receiving multifocal lenses may experience more visual problems than with monofocal lenses. The most common adverse visual effects from multifocal IOLs include glare, halos (rings around lights), and a loss of contrast sensitivity, in low light conditions. Accommodating Some newer lens designs attempt to allow the eye to regain some partial focusing ability in order to change focus from distance to near (accommodation). However, many accommodating IOLs used today only achieve a very limited improvements in near vision which reduced over time. Accommodative intraocular lenses may also have a slightly higher risk of developing posterior capsule opacification (PCO), though there is some uncertainty around this finding. PCO is a common side-effect of many cataract surgeries and is easily treatable with a one-time laser capsulotomy procedure (see below). Accommodating IOLs interact with ciliary muscles and zonules, using hinges at both ends to ‚Äúlatch on‚Äù and move forward and backward inside the eye using the same mechanism as normal accommodation. These IOLs have a 4.5-mm square-edged optic and a long hinged plate design with polyimide loops at the end of the haptics. The hinges are made of an advanced silicone called BioSil that was thoroughly tested to make sure it was capable of unlimited flexing in the eye.Slade, Stephen. \\"Accommodating IOLs: Design, Technique, Results.\\" Review of Ophthalmology. 2005. 20 Mar 2009. <> Toric A toric IOL is a type of toric lens used to correct preexisting corneal astigmatism at the time of cataract surgery. Astigmatism can also be treated with limbal relaxing incisions or an excimer laser procedure. About 40% of Americans have significant astigmatism and thus may be candidates for a toric IOL. Cataract surgery with implantation of a toric IOL is essentially the same as cataract surgery with a conventional IOL. Like toric contact lenses, toric IOLs have different powers in different meridians of the lens, and they must be positioned on the correct meridian to reverse the preexisting astigmatism. If the toric IOL is not on the correct meridian, it may need to be repositioned in a second procedure. Multifocal toric Standard toric IOLs are monofocal, permanently focused on distant objects. Multifocal toric IOLs are also available. These lenses provide the patient not only with correction of preexisting astigmatism, but also with multiple-focused vision at far and reading distance Phakic IOLs Phakic IOLs (PIOLs) are intraocular lenses which are placed in an eye that still contains a natural human crystalline lens. PIOLs are sometimes referred to as an 'implantable contact lenses' (ICLs). As with other IOLs, PIOLs can be either spheric or toric. Toric PIOLs have to be aligned with the meridian of astigmatism; toric IOL misalignment or rotation can lead to residual or even greater astigmatism postoperatively. Depending on their attachment site to the eye, PIOLs can be divided into three categories: * Angle-supported PIOLs, placed in the anterior chamber. They are notorious for their negative impact on the corneal endothelial lining, which is vital for maintaining a healthy clear cornea. * Iris-fixated PIOLs, attached by claws to the mid-peripheral iris by a technique called enclavation. It is believed to have a lesser effect on corneal endothelium. The main complication with this type is their tendency to cause endothelial cell reduction. *Sulcus-supported PIOLs, placed in the posterior chamber in front of the natural crystalline lens. This type of PIOLs is gaining more and more popularity. They have special vaulting so as not to be in contact with the normal lens. The main complication with older versions was a small possibility of cataract formation.  Blue-light filtering IOLs  Blue light filtering IOLs filter the UV and high-energy blue light present in natural and artificial light, both of which can cause vision problems; however too much filtering of blue light can increase depression, especially in the winter months (SAD). The trademarked \\"Natural Yellow\\" material is available in three hydrophilic IOLs. Dr. Patrick H. Benz of Benz Research and Development created the first IOL material to incorporate the same UV-A blocking and violet light filtering chromophore that's present in the human crystalline lens in order to attempt to protect the retina after cataract extraction of the natural crystalline lens. A Cochrane Review found little evidence of important differences between blue‚Äêlight filtering and non‚Äêblue‚Äêlight filtering lenses for protecting the macula (back of the eye) after cataract surgery. This was due to studies being too small and too short‚Äêterm to provide reliable evidence. Posterior capsule opacification A posterior capsular opacity (PCO) around a posterior chamber IOL (as seen on retroillumination in a slit lamp). Posterior capsule opacification (PCO), often referred to as \\"after cataract\\", is the most common complication of cataract surgery. In a small percentage of patients, posterior chamber intraocular lenses may form PCOs a few months after implantation. They are easily treatable, and typically only require a one-time capsulotomy procedure (using a Nd:YAG laser) to clarify. Materials Acrylic MICS-IOL in holder The materials that have been used to manufacture intraocular lens implants include polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), silicone, hydrophobic acrylate, hydrophilic acrylate and collamer.Belluci R. An Introduction to Intraocular Lenses: Material, Optics, Haptics, Design and Aberration. In: G√ºell JL (ed): Cataract. ESASO Course Series. Basel, Karger, 2013, vol 3, pp 38‚Äì55 Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) was the first material to be used successfully in intraocular lenses. British ophthalmologist Sir Harold Ridley observed that Royal Air Force pilots who sustained eye injuries during World War II involving PMMA windshield material did not show any rejection or foreign body reaction. Deducing that the transparent material was inert and useful for implantation in the eye, Ridley designed and implanted the first intraocular lens in a human eye. Advances in technology have brought about the use of silicone and acrylic glass, both of which are soft foldable inert materials. This allows the lens to be folded and inserted into the eye through a smaller incision. Specifically, acrylic lenses are a better choice in people who have a history of uveitis or are likely to have to undergo retinal surgery requiring vitrectomy with replacement by silicone oil, such as persons with proliferative diabetic retinopathy or who are at high risk of retinal detachment, such as persons with high myopia. A study found that in participants with a history of uveitis, eyes treated with hydrophobic acrylic IOLs were over 2 times more likely to have a best corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or more, compared to eyes treated with silicone IOLs. History Plaque at St Thomas' Hospital - site of first permanent insertion of an intraocular lens, 8 February 1950 Sir Harold Ridley was the first to successfully implant an intraocular lens on 29 November 1949, at St Thomas' Hospital at London. That lens was manufactured by the Rayner company of Brighton, East Sussex, England from Perspex CQ polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) made by ICI (Imperial Chemical Industries). It is said the idea of implanting an intraocular lens came to him after an intern asked him why he was not replacing the lens he had removed during cataract surgery. The acrylic plastic material was chosen because Ridley noticed it was inert after seeing RAF (Royal Air Force) pilots of World War II with pieces of shattered canopies in their eyes (this acrylic resin is known by several trade names including Lucite and Plexiglas). The intraocular lens did not find widespread acceptance in cataract surgery until the 1970s, when further developments in lens design and surgical techniques had come about. As of the early 2000s, more than a million IOLs were implanted annually in the United States. That number was estimated by the World Health Organization to have increased to 20 million annually worldwide by 2010 (for cataract surgery), and has projected increased IOL surgeries to reach 32 million worldwide by 2020.

Bred as a fox and vermin hunter, the Border Terrier shares ancestry with the Dandie Dinmont Terrier and the Bedlington Terrier. The Border Terrier was officially recognized by The Kennel Club in Great Britain in 1920, and by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1930. The border terrier was bred to have long enough legs to keep up with the horses and other foxhounds, which traveled with them, and small enough bodies to crawl in the burrows of foxes and chase them out so the hunters had a blank shot. The foxhounds that traveled with them were not small enough to do the Border terrier's job. In 2006, the Border Terrier ranked 81st in number of registrations by the AKC, while it ranked tenth in the United Kingdom. In 2008, the Border Terrier ranked eighth in number of registrations by the UK Kennel Club. They were originally used for hunting in packs as they excel at catching rabbits and any small animal. Now they are commonly seen as family pets.  Description   Appearance  Unstripped Border Terrier A Border Terrier portrait Identifiable by their otter-shaped heads, Border Terriers have a broad skull and moderately short muzzle, and strong teeth. The V-shaped ears are on the sides of the head and fall towards the cheeks. Common coat colors are grizzle-and-tan, blue-and-tan, red, or wheaten. Whiskers are few and short. The tail is naturally moderately short, thick at the base and tapering. Narrow-bodied and well-proportioned, males stand at the shoulder, and weigh ; females and . They are very versatile in families and as family pets. The Border Terrier has a double coat consisting of a short, dense, soft undercoat and harsh, wiry weather- and dirt-resistant, close-lying outer coat with no curl or wave. This coat usually requires hand-stripping twice a year to remove dead hair. It then takes about eight weeks for the top coat to come back in. For some dogs, weekly brushing will suffice. Most Border Terriers are seen groomed with short hair but longer hair can sometimes be preferred.  Temperament  Though sometimes stubborn and strong willed, border terriers are sound dogs. They are friendly and rarely aggressive. They are good with children, but may chase cats and other small pets. Borders do well in task-oriented activities and have a surprising ability to jump high and run fast given the size of their legs. The breed has excelled in agility training, but they are quicker to learn jumps and see-saws than weaving poles. They take training for tasks very well, and are extremely trainable, and capable of learning tricks quickly and competently. The border in recent years has been bred to harbor a more subtle character so are more adaptable to apartment living if properly exercised. They are intelligent and eager to please, but they retain the capacity for independent thinking and initiative that were bred into them for working rats and fox underground. Their love of people and even temperament make them fine therapy dogs, especially for children and the elderly, and they are occasionally used to aid the blind or deaf. From a young age they should be trained on command. Borders can adapt to different environments and situations well, and are able to deal with temporary change well. They will get along well with cats that they have been raised with, but may chase other cats and small animals such as mice, birds, rabbits, squirrels, rats, and guinea pigs. Borders are very independent and loyal. Some borders are known to be territorial and will protect their homes. They have a strong sense of smell. Borders love to sit and watch what is going on. Walks with Borders will often involve them sitting and lying in the grass to observe the environment around them. Female red Border Terrier. Red Grizzled Border Terrier Border Terrier performing jump in Dog Agility  Health  Borders are a generally hardy breed, though there are certain genetic health problems associated with them, including: * Hip dysplasia * Perthes disease * Various heart defects * Juvenile cataracts * Progressive retinal atrophy * Seizures * Canine epileptoid cramping syndrome (CECS) A UK Kennel Club survey puts their median lifespan at 14 years and listed a maximum age of 22 years, one month.  Earthdog trials  Border Terriers have earned more American Kennel Club (AKC) Earthdog titles than any other terrier. An AKC earthdog test is not true hunting, but an artificial, non-competitive, exercise in which terriers enter wide smooth wooden tunnels, buried under- ground, with one or more turns in order to bark or scratch at caged rats that are safely housed behind wooden bars. The tests are conducted to determine that instinctive traits are preserved and developed, as the breed originators intended for the dogs to their work. While earthdog tests are not a close approximation of hunting, they are popular in the U.S. and in some European countries because even over-large Kennel Club breeds can negotiate the tunnels with ease, dogs can come to no harm while working, and no digging is required. Since Border Terriers are \\"essentially working terriers\\", many Border Terrier owners consider it important to test and develop their dogs' instinct. These tests also provide great satisfaction for the dogs. The American Working Terrier Association (AWTA) does conduct \\"trials\\"; where the dogs instincts are tested, and then judged to determine a \\"Best of Breed\\" Earthdog. History Originally the Border Terrier was referred to as the Coquetdale Terrier or Redesdale Terrier from the area in which it evolved, but by the late 1800s it was generally known as the Border Terrier, probably because of its long history with the Border Hunt in Northumberland. It shares its ancestry with that of the Bedlington Terrier and the Dandie Dinmont Terrier. It was recognised as a breed by the Kennel Club in 1920, the same year The Border Terrier Club was formed. Their original purpose was to bolt foxes which had gone to ground. They were also used to kill rodents, but they have been used to hunt otters and badgers too. The first Kennel Club Border Terrier ever registered was The Moss Trooper, a dog sired by Jacob Robson's Chip in 1912 and registered in the Kennel Club's Any Other Variety listing in 1913. The Border Terrier was rejected for formal Kennel Club recognition in 1914, but won its slot in 1920, with the first standard being written by Jacob Robson and John Dodd. Jasper Dodd was made first President of the Club.

Symptoms include projectile vomiting without the presence of bile. This most often occurs after the baby is fed. The typical age that symptoms become obvious is two to twelve weeks old. The cause of pyloric stenosis is unclear. Risk factors in babies include birth by cesarean section, preterm birth, bottle feeding, and being first born. The diagnosis may be made by feeling an olive-shaped mass in the baby's abdomen. This is often confirmed with ultrasound. Treatment initially begins by correcting dehydration and electrolyte problems. This is then typically followed by surgery. Results are generally good both in the short term and in the long term. Some treat the condition without surgery by using atropine. About one to two per 1,000 babies are affected. Males are affected about four times more often than females. The condition is very rare in adults. The first description of pyloric stenosis was in 1888 with surgery management first carried out in 1912 by Conrad Ramstedt. Before surgical treatment most babies died. Signs and symptoms Babies with this condition usually present any time in the first weeks to 6 months of life with progressively worsening vomiting. It is more likely to affect the first-born with males more commonly than females at a ratio of 4 to 1. The vomiting is often described as non-bile stained (\\"non bilious\\") and \\"projectile vomiting\\", because it is more forceful than the usual spitting up (gastroesophageal reflux) seen at this age. Some infants present with poor feeding and weight loss but others demonstrate normal weight gain. Dehydration may occur which causes a baby to cry without having tears and to produce less wet or dirty diapers due to not urinating for hours or for a few days. Symptoms usually begin between 3 and 12 weeks of age. Findings include epigastric fullness with visible peristalsis in the upper abdomen from the infant's left to right. Constant hunger, belching, and colic are other possible signs that the baby is unable to eat properly. Cause Rarely, infantile pyloric stenosis can occur as an autosomal dominant condition.It is uncertain whether it is a congenital anatomic narrowing or a functional hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter muscle. Pathophysiology The gastric outlet obstruction due to the hypertrophic pylorus impairs emptying of gastric contents into the duodenum. As a consequence, all ingested food and gastric secretions can only exit via vomiting, which can be of a projectile nature. While the exact cause of the hypertrophy remains unknown, one study suggested that neonatal hyperacidity may be involved in the pathogenesis. This physiological explanation for the development of clinical pyloric stenosis at around 4 weeks and its spontaneous long term cure without surgery if treated conservatively, has recently been further reviewed. Persistent vomiting results in loss of stomach acid (hydrochloric acid). The vomited material does not contain bile because the pyloric obstruction prevents entry of duodenal contents (containing bile) into the stomach. The chloride loss results in a low blood chloride level which impairs the kidney's ability to excrete bicarbonate. This is the factor that prevents correction of the alkalosis leading to metabolic alkalosis.Kerry Brandis, Acid-Base Physiology . Retrieved December 31, 2006. A secondary hyperaldosteronism develops due to the decreased blood volume. The high aldosterone levels causes the kidneys to avidly retain Na+ (to correct the intravascular volume depletion), and excrete increased amounts of K+ into the urine (resulting in a low blood level of potassium).The body's compensatory response to the metabolic alkalosis is hypoventilation resulting in an elevated arterial pCO2. Diagnosis Pyloric stenosis as seen on ultrasound in a 6 week old Diagnosis is via a careful history and physical examination, often supplemented by radiographic imaging studies. Pyloric stenosis should be suspected in any young infant with severe vomiting. On physical exam, palpation of the abdomen may reveal a mass in the epigastrium. This mass, which consists of the enlarged pylorus, is referred to as the 'olive', and is sometimes evident after the infant is given formula to drink. Rarely, there are peristaltic waves that may be felt or seen (video on NEJM) due to the stomach trying to force its contents past the narrowed pyloric outlet. Most cases of pyloric stenosis are diagnosed/confirmed with ultrasound, if available, showing the thickened pylorus and non-passage of gastric contents into the proximal duodenum. Muscle wall thickness 3 millimeters (mm) or greater and pyloric channel length of 15 mm or greater are considered abnormal in infants younger than 30 days. Gastric contents should not be seen passing through the pylorus because if it does, pyloric stenosis should be excluded and other differential diagnoses such as pylorospasm should be considered. The positions of superior mesenteric artery and superior mesenteric vein should be noted because altered positions of the these two vessels would be suggestive of intestinal malrotation instead of pyloric stenosis. Although the baby is exposed to radiation, an upper GI series (x-rays taken after the baby drinks a special contrast agent) can be diagnostic by showing the pylorus with elongated, narrow lumen and a dent in the duodenal bulb. A \\"string sign\\" or the \\"railroad track sign\\". For either type of study, there are specific measurement criteria used to identify the abnormal results. Plain x-rays of the abdomen sometimes shows a dilated stomach.Although UGI endoscopy would demonstrate pyloric obstruction, physicians would find it difficult to differentiate accurately between hypertrophic pyloric stenosis and pylorospasm. Blood tests will reveal low blood levels of potassium and chloride in association with an increased blood pH and high blood bicarbonate level due to loss of stomach acid (which contains hydrochloric acid) from persistent vomiting. There will be exchange of extracellular potassium with intracellular hydrogen ions in an attempt to correct the pH imbalance. These findings can be seen with severe vomiting from any cause. Treatment Vertical Pyloromyotomy scar (large) 30 hrs post-op in a one-month-old baby Horizontal Pyloromyotomy scar 10 days post-op in a one- month-old baby Infantile pyloric stenosis is typically managed with surgery; very few cases are mild enough to be treated medically. The danger of pyloric stenosis comes from the dehydration and electrolyte disturbance rather than the underlying problem itself. Therefore, the baby must be initially stabilized by correcting the dehydration and the abnormally high blood pH seen in combination with low chloride levels with IV fluids. This can usually be accomplished in about 24‚Äì48 hours. Intravenous and oral atropine may be used to treat pyloric stenosis. It has a success rate of 85-89% compared to nearly 100% for pyloromyotomy, however it requires prolonged hospitalization, skilled nursing and careful follow up during treatment. It might be an alternative to surgery in children who have contraindications for anesthesia or surgery, or in children whose parents do not want surgery. Surgery The definitive treatment of pyloric stenosis is with surgical pyloromyotomy known as Ramstedt's procedure (dividing the muscle of the pylorus to open up the gastric outlet). This surgery can be done through a single incision (usually 3‚Äì4 cm long) or laparoscopically (through several tiny incisions), depending on the surgeon's experience and preference. Today, the laparoscopic technique has largely supplanted the traditional open repairs which involved either a tiny circular incision around the navel or the Ramstedt procedure. Compared to the older open techniques, the complication rate is equivalent, except for a markedly lower risk of wound infection. This is now considered the standard of care at the majority of children's hospitals across the US, although some surgeons still perform the open technique. Following repair, the small 3mm incisions are hard to see. The vertical incision, pictured and listed above, is no longer usually required, though many incisions have been horizontal in the past years.Once the stomach can empty into the duodenum, feeding can begin again. Some vomiting may be expected during the first days after surgery as the gastrointestinal tract settles. Rarely, the myotomy procedure performed is incomplete and projectile vomiting continues, requiring repeat surgery. Pyloric stenosis generally has no long term side-effects or impact on the child's future. Epidemiology Males are more commonly affected than females, with firstborn males affected about four times as often, and there is a genetic predisposition for the disease. It is commonly associated with people of Scandinavian ancestry, and has multifactorial inheritance patterns. Pyloric stenosis is more common in Caucasians than Hispanics, Blacks, or Asians. The incidence is 2.4 per 1000 live births in Caucasians, 1.8 in Hispanics, 0.7 in Blacks, and 0.6 in Asians. It is also less common amongst children of mixed race parents. Caucasian male babies with blood type B or O are more likely than other types to be affected. Infants exposed to erythromycin are at increased risk for developing hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, especially when the drug is taken around two weeks of life and possibly in late pregnancy and through breastmilk in the first two weeks of life.

They formed in 1974, and are best known for their 1984 single \\"Rock You\\". The original lineup was formed by drummer Bruce Arnold, and consisted of lead vocalist Brian Vollmer, guitarists Ron Watson and Rick \\"Minstrel\\" Trembley, keyboardist Don Simmons, and bassist Keith \\"Bert\\" Zurbrigg. However, their most well known lineup, and the one that recorded \\"Rock You\\", was the 1980s version of the band: Vollmer on vocals, accompanied by guitarists Brent \\"The Doctor\\" Doerner and Paul Hackman, bassist Daryl Gray, and drummer Greg \\"Fritz\\" Hinz. The history of the band has been marked by many lineup changes, with Vollmer being the sole constant member and only remaining member of the original lineup. Although Hackman was killed in a tour bus accident in 1992, the surviving members of the 1980s lineup reunited in 2009 for an album and have continued to tour since 2011. Watson died in 2019. Helix have toured with bands such as Kiss, Aerosmith, Rush, M√∂tley Cr√ºe, Alice Cooper, Whitesnake, Night Ranger, Heart, Quiet Riot, W.A.S.P., Ian Gillan and Mot√∂rhead among others. Their most recent studio album is Old School (2019).  History   Early years: 1974‚Äì1982  Helix were formed in 1974 for a battle of the bands contest in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada by drummer Bruce Arnold. They were originally a six-piece, consisting of Arnold, lead vocalist Brian Vollmer, guitarists Ron Watson and Rick \\"Minstrel\\" Trembley, keyboardist Don Simmons, and bassist Keith \\"Bert\\" Zurbrigg, who always wore his trademark tuxedo on stage. Their original name was The Helix Field Band, soon shortened to simply Helix. Trembley left after a few months, making the band a five-piece. Soon after, Helix scored some crucial shows as Del Shannon's backing band on some Canadian dates. However, the original lineup dissolved by 1976, and three new members entered the fold. Replacing Simmons, Watson and Arnold were guitarists Brent \\"The Doctor\\" Doerner and Paul Hackman, who would both remain with Helix through the 1980s, and drummer Brian Doerner, Brent's twin brother. Brian Doerner only stayed four years, but returned as a member and a guest several times before joining Saga in 2005. With new management under Kitchener's William Seip, Helix released two independent albums on their own H&S; Records, entitled Breaking Loose and White Lace & Black Leather, in 1979 and 1981 respectively. During the sessions for Breaking Loose, Helix recorded a cover of the Del Shannon hit \\"Thinkin' It Over\\", unreleased until the 1999 Helix CD B-Sides. Their second album, White Lace & Black Leather, brought more lineup changes with drummer Leo Niebudek taking over for Brian Doerner. Michael J. Fox auditioned to replace bassist Keith Zurbrigg but the job ultimately went to Mike Uzelac. With Zurbrigg gone, Brian Vollmer was now the last remaining original member. Commercial success: 1983‚Äì1989 Changing their image from that of a standard bar band to a more image-conscious metal band, Helix finally signed to Capitol Records after being rejected by them three times. In 1983, they released No Rest for the Wicked, with Greg \\"Fritz\\" Hinz (ex-Starchild) on drums. This album featured Canadian hit video \\"Heavy Metal Love\\", which featured their new look. Under Seip's advice, Helix dropped their T-shirts and jeans in favour of leather clothing in order to stay current. The tour for this album cycle was not without drama. Mike Uzelac, whose drug use had become problematic, left the band to be replaced by a bass player named Peter Guy from London, Ontario. Guy was unable to travel to the United States due to a previous drug conviction, and Uzelac came back to finish the tour. When Uzelac had fulfilled his commitment, Mark Rector of Kitchener was hired on bass. He was let go at the conclusion of the tour. With the addition of bassist Daryl Gray completing the band's classic 1980s lineup, they released Walkin' the Razor's Edge in 1984. It sold over 100,000 copies in Canada, and over 400,000 internationally. The album also included their best known song \\"Rock You\\" and a cover of A Foot in Coldwater's \\"(Make Me Do) Anything You Want\\". The band's also released a music video for the Crazy Elephant cover \\"Gimme Gimme Good Lovin'\\" the same year, creating a parody of the Miss America Pageant titled the \\"Miss Rock Fantasy\\" Pageant. Two versions were created: an uncensored version featuring semi-nude and topless women, and a censored version made available for the more mainstream media markets like MTV. The ending of both versions of the video feature comedian Rip Taylor seated on a motorcycle surrounded by the band and the models all waving goodbye. It caused some controversy several years after its initial release when it was learned that among the cast of porn stars that appear topless in the uncensored version was a then-unknown 16-year-old Traci Lords as \\"Miss Georgia\\". (This version was also featured in a pornographic video titled Electric Blue 26.) In 1985, Helix released their fifth album Long Way to Heaven, featuring the singles \\"Deep Cuts the Knife\\" and \\"The Kids Are All Shakin'\\". The album allowed the band to tour Sweden, becoming the first Canadian rock band to do an extensive Swedish tour. The result was a No. 1 album in that country. The following year, their song \\"It's Too Late\\" was featured in the movie Iron Eagle and its soundtrack album (this was a completely different song than the track \\"It's Too Late\\" that appeared on their second album). Long Way to Heaven was followed by the release of Wild in the Streets in 1987, featuring the title track and a cover of \\"Dream On\\" by Nazareth. One song from that record, \\"She's Too Tough\\" was written by Joe Elliot, lead singer for Def Leppard. Leppard also recorded their own version of \\"She's Too Tough\\" and released it as a B-side and on their album Retro Active. The recording of Wild in the Streets, done in England with producer Mike Stone, was plagued by extensive takes and remixes. Still, the album went gold in Canada, but only managed a disappointing No. 179 on the Billboard 200 in the United States.[ Billboard - Wild In The Streets] Capitol released the first Helix compilation album Over 60 minutes with... at the end of 1989, which featured new and unreleased material as well as the hits. At the end of the decade, Brent Doerner quit the band, tired of the grind of touring. Helix was left as a four piece. Lineup changes and tragedy: 1990‚Äì2003 Helix began the 1990s with Back for Another Taste, which Doerner contributed songwriting and guitar parts to. On tour, Helix brought in their first American member, Denny Balicky. As a touring member, Balicky was not featured in any of their music videos, but he did make significant appearances in the MuchMusic hourlong special Walzing With Helix, which documented Helix's European tour with Sacred Reich and Ian Gillan. Balicky later appeared in the retrospective documentary 30 Years of Helix: No Rest for the Wicked after changing his name to Denny Blake. After this tour, Vollmer and Hackman began writing songs with the intention of Hackman's material being used for the next Helix release, and Vollmer's going towards a solo album. In the meantime, The Early Years was released by A&M; Records, which compiled their first two independent albums on CD for the first time. Helix toured sporadically during this time, including a special reunion show in Kitchener featuring Keith Zurbrigg and the Doerner brothers. A 1992 Western Canadian tour was booked, with Brian Doerner filling in on drums for the unavailable Greg Hinz, and Brent Doerner filling in for Denny Balicki. It was during this tour when disaster struck. On July 5, 1992, Paul Hackman, not wearing a seatbelt, was killed when the group's van rolled down a 40-foot embankment after a concert in Vancouver. Recovering from the shock of his death, Vollmer regrouped with Brent Doerner once again, and also recruited former Brighton Rock guitarist Greg Fraser. Vollmer took the songs he had recorded for his solo album, and released them as the next Helix record, It's a Business Doing Pleasure (released on Aquarius in 1993, their Capitol contract now finished). He included the song \\"That Day Is Gonna Come\\" as a tribute to Hackman, and the video for the song featured unique Super 8 and video footage shot by Vollmer on the road over the years. Brian Doerner played drums on the album. Greg Fraser stated that no then-members of Helix aside from Vollmer himself actually played on the album, since it was in fact a solo album, although they were all pictured and credited in the packaging. However, longtime bassist Daryl Gray did play fretless bass on \\"Love Is a Crazy Game\\" and sing background vocals on the rest of the album. Brian Vollmer would later call the album: Brent Doerner left the band for the second time after a few shows supporting It's a Business Doing Pleasure. Helix were forced to carry on with a rapid succession of replacement guitar players: Gary Borden (ex-Ray Lyell), Mark Chichkan (ex-Mindstorm), and Rick Mead (ex-Sire), a rotating cast who played at shows when they were available. By 1996, both Greg Fraser and \\"Fritz\\" Hinz had departed as well. Brian Vollmer and Daryl Gray carried on with new drummer Glen \\"Archie\\" Gamble in 1997, who took on some of their workload such as road managing duties. In order to keep new Helix product in stores, five new studio tracks were recorded and released in 1998 on half- ALIVE, produced by Daryl Gray, which compiled these with live tracks from previous tours. Vollmer also released compilations of hits and rare tracks, as well as his first official solo album (When Pigs Fly, 1999) through his website. The band continued to play live through this period, recruiting new guitar players as they were available. At various times, Mike Hall and Gerry Finn, who were both in Killer Dwarfs, joined Helix on the road, as did Darren Smith, the former Harem Scarem drummer, who had switched to guitar. Periodically, the surviving members of the classic 1980s lineup would reform, as they did on the B-Sides CD to record three new songs including \\"Danger Zone\\", which were again produced by Daryl Gray. This was a song that Paul Hackman had been working on shortly before his death. At the beginning of the new decade, Helix had to endure another major lineup change. Daryl Gray left the band in 2002 due to an increasingly strained relationship with Vollmer, leaving Brian as the sole member from their 1980s heyday. With Glen Gamble's help, Vollmer added three new members to bring some stability back to the lineup: Jeff \\"Stan\\" Fountain replacing Daryl Gray on bass, Dan Fawcett on guitar, and Shaun Sanders on guitar. All three had played together with Gamble in London's Buffalo Brothers. 30th Anniversary In 2004, the 30th anniversary of Helix, the band released several titles to mark the occasion. Their first new studio album of all-original material in over a decade came out, titled Rockin' in My Outer Space. Two compilation CDs were also put together, Never Trust Anyone Over 30 in the US, and Rockin' You For 30 Years in Canada.Metal Shrine - Mail-intervju - Brian Vollmer, Helix These albums were marked by a new Helix lineup, and for the first time since 1974, a six- piece: Vollmer, Gamble, Fountain, and new members Jim Lawson (ex-Cherry Smash, guitar), and the husband and wife team of Rainer (guitar) and Cindy Wiechmann (acoustic guitar and vocals). Vollmer first encountered the Wiechmanns in Newfoundland when their band, KAOS, opened for Helix on the Long Way to Heaven tour. The band played a special 30th anniversary concert at Brantford Ontario's Sanderson Centre. The show featured the current band and past members. Guests included members of the original 1974 Helix lineup (Ron Watson, Bruce Arnold, Keith \\"Bert\\" Zurbrigg, and Don Simmons), as well as Brent Doerner, Brian Doerner, Leo Niebudek, and Greg \\"Fritz\\" Hinz. The night was released on DVD as the 30th Anniversary Concert. Released at the same time was the documentary DVD 30 Years of Helix: No Rest for the Wicked. Helix experienced a slight resurgence in popularity at this point thanks to a third- season episode of the television series Trailer Park Boys (\\"Closer to the Heart\\"), in which Bubbles and Ricky discuss the merits of Helix compared to Rush. Vollmer also filmed a cameo during that season which was included as a DVD deleted scene. Helix was mentioned in several other episodes; it's revealed that Ricky especially favors attending, and selling marijuana at, their concerts. In July 2005, Vollmer announced that Helix would be entering the studio to record another new album of original material as well as a cover album. The cover album was intended to be released in spring 2006 and consist entirely of Canadian rock songs. The tentative title was Many Are Cold But Few Are Frozen, but it never materialized. Finally, Brian Vollmer published his autobiography, Gimme An R, in December 2005. The book covered the numerous lineup changes and ups and downs of Helix through their 30-year career, along with many rare photos. Increased activity: 2005 ‚Äì July 2009 In late 2005, Glen Gamble left Helix to form his own band, The Joys. Gamble was briefly replaced by a returning Brian Doerner, who stayed with the band for several months. With Gamble gone, Brian Vollmer was left to manage every aspect of the Helix organization, from booking tours, to distributing Helix merchandise. More lineup changes ensued in 2006: Brian Doerner again departed, this time to play in Saga. He was replaced by Brent \\"Ned\\" Niemi, who was a veteran of the Toronto progressive metal band THD that also featured former Slash Puppet vocalist Mif. Helix toured with this new lineup, most notably opening for Alice Cooper in Canada, before Rainer and Cindy Wiechmann left amicably and formed their own band Nail. Rainer was replaced on guitar by Kitchener's Rick VanDyk, formerly of Zero Option who had released an album in the early 1990s. Finally, bassist Jeff Fountain left and was replaced by Paul Fonseca. VanDyk, Fonseca, and Niemi had all played together part-time in a Metallica tribute band called Sandman. With these musicians on board, Helix began augmenting their live setlist with Metallica's \\"Creeping Death\\" riff to segue between songs. Recording for a new album began. In October 2006, the song \\"Heavy Metal Love\\" was to be featured on the soundtrack for the Trailer Park Boys movie The Big Dirty, however, at the last minute, the track was pulled by Dean Cameron, president of EMI Canada, as distribution of the soundtrack was being handled by Universal, and not EMI who owns the track. To make up for this, Helix re-recorded \\"Heavy Metal Love\\" and included it on their next release, the 2006 EP Get Up!. The original song was still included in the movie even though it did not appear on the soundtrack CD. The Get Up! EP itself was hyped by Vollmer as \\"...very reminiscent of the No Rest for the Wicked album.\\" In 2007, Helix re-released all the tracks from Get Up! along with four new studio tracks on a full-length studio album called The Power of Rock and Roll. Unlike the EP, this album received both US and UK releases. In June of that year, Helix played the 2007 Sweden Rock Festival. A new song from The Power of Rock and Roll called \\"Fill Your Head With Rock\\" was chosen as the theme song of the festival. Following this, in October 2008 Helix produced their first Christmas CD. Although Brian Vollmer has recorded Christmas songs before on a charity CD for his church called Raising The Roof on Mary Immaculate, A Heavy Mental Christmas was the first such release from the band. By late 2008, Helix began working on a new studio album, their 12th, following up A Heavy Mental Christmas. These recording sessions coincided with another new Helix lineup: In February 2009, Brent \\"The Doctor\\" Doerner joined the band for the third time. Sean Kelly, singer and lead guitarist of Toronto's Crash Kelly, joined as the new bass player. Brent Niemi was replaced on drums by former Sven Gali member Rob MacEachern, who had actually played drums on Get Up! and The Power of Rock and Roll in Niemi's absence. Jim Lawson remained on guitar, VanDyk having departed to make room for the returning Brent Doerner. Work on the new studio CD progressed with Sean Kelly co-writing and co- producing. In February 2009, Vollmer reunited the surviving members of the No Rest for the Wicked lineup (Brent Doerner, Mike Uzelac and Greg Hinz) to record a new version of the AC/DC classic \\"It's a Long Way to the Top\\", to be included on a compilation album. Concurrent to the new Helix lineup and CD, Brent Doerner formed his own band, My Wicked Twin, featuring Brian Doerner, Mike Uzelac, and Shane Schedler (formerly of Kitchener's Martyrs of Melody). They released their debut CD in January 2009. Current and 80s band reunion: July 2009 ‚Äì present In an unexpected turn of events, after their July 10, 2009 Rocklahoma performance, Sean Kelly amicably gave notice that he was quitting Helix to be the new guitar player in Nelly Furtado's band. His first date with Furtado was in Mexico City in September 2009. After Kelly's departure, Brian Vollmer reunited the surviving members of the classic 1980s lineup: Daryl Gray, Greg \\"Fritz\\" Hinz, and Brent Doerner. At their first rehearsal together, Hinz reported, \\"‚Ä¶it was like we had never left. We all fell right into the groove.\\" In regards to reuniting the old band, Vollmer cited fatigue of the rotating Helix lineups: Daryl Gray was the first member to play live with the band, appearing August 9, 2009 in Lewisporte, Newfoundland. Jim Lawson's departure was announced on August 30, 2009. According to Vollmer, \\"Unfortunately, the long distance between where he lives (Sudbury, Ontario) and where the band operates became a factor in Jim staying with us.\\" Orangeville's Kaleb \\"Duckman\\" Duck (of BraVurA), who played on Brent's My Wicked Twin CD, was hired on second guitar. Rob MacEachern amicably stepped down for Hinz to return. The new Helix CD was tentatively titled It‚Äôs Rock Science, NOT Rocket Science!, before being changed to Vagabond Bones after a song co-written by Kelly. Doerner, Gray and Hinz all appear on the album, along with Sean Kelly, Brent Niemi, Rob MacEachern and Russ \\"Dwarf\\" Graham of Moxy and Killer Dwarfs. The songs were described by Vollmer as music \\"which harkens back to our roots, yet sounds contemporary.\\" A western Canadian tour was played in October 2009. Brian Vollmer had a cameo appearance in the second Trailer Park Boys movie Countdown to Liquor Day, released September 25, 2009. Helix also performed at the opening gala of the premier of the movie at the Halifax Metro Centre. The reunion tour has lasted into 2010 including both Canadian and US dates. Brian Vollmer also implied that he would like to continue writing for future Helix albums with former member Sean Kelly. In regards to Kelly's departure in 2009, Vollmer stated, \\"I give Sean my blessings, no worries. As long as we continue to write together, I am happy.\\" On August 15, 2010, Vollmer announced the forthcoming release of two new Helix albums. The first, titled Smash Hits...Unplugged! contains acoustic re- recorded versions of Helix hits and a cover of the late Canadian singer James Leroy's \\"Touch Of Magic\\". The second album is a compilation called Running Wild in the 21st Century, containing Helix and Vollmer solo material from 1999‚Äì2010, including two unreleased tracks (\\"The William Tell Overture\\" and a new unnamed original song.) It was originally scheduled to be released in October 2010 but was delayed until 2011, due to problems getting permission to include the AC/DC cover \\"It's a Long Way to the Top\\". It will be replaced by a new original song instead, causing the delay. In November 2010, Vollmer announced that the band were filming a pilot episode for a Helix-based reality television series. In 2012, Helix toured across eight cities in southwestern/southeastern Ontario for a mini Heavy Mental Christmas Tour. Performing classic Christmas songs but with a twist of heavy metal, and they played their hit songs such as \\"Rock You\\", \\"Heavy Metal Love\\" and their own song \\"All I Want for Christmas... Is the Leafs to Win the Cup\\". Currently, the band is playing in bars/casinos across Canada.  Outside Helix  Brent and Brian Doerner maintain My Wicked Twin as an ongoing prospect alongside their main bands, Helix, and Crisis What Crisis, a Supertramp tribute band. Brian Vollmer currently teaches the classical vocal technique, Bel canto, in London, Ontario, as well as singing classical music at weddings and funerals throughout southern Ontario. He has given vocal lessons to Mercedes Lander of the heavy metal band Kittie who also hail from London. His wife Lynda helps with the running of the Helix business from their home, which they have dubbed \\"Planet Helix\\". \\"Planet Helix\\" was featured in a 2007 episode of MTV Cribs  Band members  Current members *Brian Vollmer - lead vocals, cowbell (1974‚Äìpresent) *Greg \\"Fritz\\" Hinz - drums (1982‚Äì1996, 2009‚Äìpresent) *Daryl Gray - bass, keyboards, piano (1984‚Äì2002, 2009‚Äìpresent) *Kaleb \\"Duckman\\" Duck - guitar (2009‚Äìpresent) *Chris Julke - guitar (2014‚Äìpresent) *Gary Borden - guitar (1996-1998, various shows, 2019-present) Former members *Bruce Arnold - drums (1974‚Äì1976) *Ron Watson - guitar (1974‚Äì1975) (died January 17, 2019) *Rick \\"Minstrel\\" Trembley - guitar (1974) *Don Simmons - keyboards (1974‚Äì1976) *Keith \\"Bert\\" Zurbrigg - bass (1974‚Äì1980) *Brent \\"The Doctor\\" Doerner - guitar, vocals (1975‚Äì1989, 1993, 2009‚Äì2012) *Paul Hackman - guitar (1976‚Äì1992; died 1992) *Brian Doerner - drums (1976‚Äì1980, 2005‚Äì2006) *Leo Niebudek - drums (1980‚Äì1982) *Mike Uzelac - bass (1980‚Äì1983) *Peter Guy - touring bassist (1983) *Mark Rector - touring bassist (1983) *Denny Balicky (Blake) - touring guitarist (1990‚Äì1991) *Greg \\"Shredder\\" Fraser - guitar (1992‚Äì1996) *Rick Mead - guitar (1993‚Äì1999, various shows) *Mark Chichkan - guitar (1996‚Äì1999, various shows) *Glen \\"Archie\\" Gamble - drums (1997‚Äì2005) *Gerry Finn - guitar (1998‚Äì2002, various shows) *Mike Hall - guitar (1999‚Äì2002, various shows) *Darren Smith - guitar (2001‚Äì2002, various shows) *Dan Fawcett - guitar (2002‚Äì2004) *Shaun Sanders - guitar (2002‚Äì2004) *Jeff \\"Stan\\" Fountain - bass (2002‚Äì2007) *Jim Lawson - guitar (2004-August 2009) *Cindy Wiechmann - backup and lead vocals, keyboards, percussion and acoustic guitar (2004‚Äì2007) *Rainer Wiechmann - guitar (2004‚Äì2007) *Paul Fonseca - bass (2007‚Äì2009) *Brent \\"Ned\\" Niemi - drums (2007‚Äì2009) *Rick VanDyk - guitar (2007‚Äì2009) *Sean Kelly - bass (2009) *Rob MacEachern - drums (2009) *John Claus - guitar, piano (2009-2014) *Gerry Finn-guitar Discography Albums Studio albums *Breaking Loose (1979) *White Lace & Black Leather (1981) *No Rest for the Wicked (1983) *Walkin' the Razor's Edge (1984) *Long Way to Heaven (1985) *Wild in the Streets (1987) *Back for Another Taste (1990) *It's a Business Doing Pleasure (1993) *Rockin' in My Outer Space (2004) *The Power of Rock and Roll (2007) *A Heavy Mental Christmas (2008) *Vagabond Bones (2009) *Bastard of the Blues (2014) *Old School (2019) Live albums *Live at the Marquee (1984) (Promotional live EP) *half-ALIVE (1998) *Live! in Buffalo (2001) Compilation albums *Over 60 minutes with...

Primarily playing in an enforcing role, Boulerice played in the National Hockey League (NHL). Playing career Boulerice was drafted by the Philadelphia Flyers in the 1996 NHL Entry Draft, 133rd overall. He has played for the Carolina Hurricanes, St. Louis Blues and Flyers. He was charged with assault in 1998 while playing with the Plymouth Whalers of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) after a violent stick-swinging incident with Guelph Storm forward Andrew Long. Boulerice is known for being the victim of an Aaron Downey left hook on February 11, 2003, after failing to land the first punch, which left Boulerice with a broken jaw and a concussion.Video of Boulerice & Downey bout from YouTube Boulerice spent the night in the hospital as his Carolina Hurricanes lost in overtime to the Dallas Stars, 2‚Äì1. Boulerice's role as an enforcer was reduced later in his career due to the NHL's stricter penalties for instigating a fight, by a $10,000 fine to the coach if it occurs in the final five minutes of a game. On October 10, 2007, Boulerice delivered a cross-check to the face of Vancouver Canucks forward Ryan Kesler, with his team up 7‚Äì2 in the third period. Boulerice received a 25-game suspension as disciplinary action from the league, which is tied for the fourth-longest suspension for an on-ice incident in modern NHL history. Boulerice started the 2008‚Äì09 season with the Lake Erie Monsters of the American Hockey League (AHL). On November 11, 2008, he signed a contract with the Colorado Avalanche and while being reassigned to the Monsters, was claimed off waivers by the Edmonton Oilers. After playing only two games with the Oilers, Boulerice was placed on waivers again, and was re-claimed by the Avalanche on November 21, 2008. Boulerice was invited to the AHL's, Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, training camp for the 2009‚Äì10 season. He made his presence felt and remained to sign a one-year contract with the Penguins on October 3, 2009. In 54 games with Wilkes-Barre, Boulerice tied his AHL career high with four goals and led the team with 124 penalty minutes. On July 29, 2010, he re-signed with the Penguins to another one-year deal. On January 7, 2011, Boulerice was suspended for 10 games for deliberately running over an AHL referee. On September 6, 2011, Boulerice's wife Jacqueline announced his retirement via Facebook.

This sequence of pitches roughly describes the scale underlying the fifth of the eight Gregorian (church) modes, known as Mode V or the authentic mode on F, theoretically using B but in practice more commonly featuring B . Ancient Greek Lydian The name Lydian refers to the ancient kingdom of Lydia in Anatolia. In Greek music theory, there was a Lydian scale or \\"octave species\\" extending from parhypate hypaton to trite diezeugmenon, equivalent in the diatonic genus to the medieval and modern Ionian mode (the major scale) . : { \\\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 7/4 e4^\\\\markup { Greek Lydian tonos (diatonic genus) on E } fis gis a b cis dis e2 } } In the chromatic and enharmonic genera, the Lydian scale was equivalent to C D E F G A B C, and C C E F F A B C, respectively , where signifies raising the pitch by approximately a quarter tone. : { \\\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 7/4 e4^\\\\markup { Greek Lydian tonos (chromatic genus) on E } f gis a bes cis dis e2 } } : { \\\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 7/4 e4^\\\\markup { Greek Lydian tonos (enharmonic genus) on E } feh gisih a aih cisih disih e2 } } Medieval Lydian mode In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, this mode was described in two ways. The first way is the diatonic octave species from F up to F an octave above, divided at C to produce two segments: : { \\\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 5/4 f4^\\\\markup { Medieval Lydian mode on F } g a b c \\\\time 4/4 \\\\parenthesize c d e f } } The second is as a mode with a final on F and an ambitus extending to F an octave higher and in which the note C was regarded as having an important melodic function. Many theorists of the period observed that B is used more typically than B in compositions in Lydian mode . Modern Lydian mode The Lydian scale can be described as a major scale with the fourth scale degree raised a semitone, making it an augmented fourth above the tonic, e.g., an F-major scale with a B rather than B.

The subdominant is diminished. The triads built on the remaining three scale degrees are minor. Notable compositions in the Lydian mode Classical (Ancient Greek) The Paean and Prosodion to the God, familiarly known as the Second Delphic Hymn, composed in 128 BC by Ath√©naios Athena√≠ou is predominantly in the Lydian tonos, both diatonic and chromatic, with sections also in Hypolydian . Medieval The 12th-century \\"Hymn to St. Magnus\\" from the Orkney Islands, referencing Magnus Erlendsson, Earl of Orkney, is in Gregorian mode or church mode V (F white notes), extending from the E below to the octave above, with B's throughout, in two-part harmony of mostly parallel thirds. The Sanctus, Agnus Dei, and Ite, missa est of Guillaume de Machaut's Messe de Nostre Dame feature extensive use of F and B, as well as F and B. Romantic A rare, extended use of the Lydian mode in the Classical repertoire is Simon Sechter's 1822 Messe in der lydischen Tonart (Mass in the Lydian Mode) . A more famous example from around the same time is the third movement of Ludwig van Beethoven's String Quartet No. 15 in A minor, Op. 132 (1825), titled by the composer \\"Heiliger Dankgesang eines Genesenen an die Gottheit, in der lydischen Tonart\\" (\\"Holy Song of Thanksgiving by a Convalescent to the Divinity, in the Lydian Mode\\"). The alternating passages in F use the Lydian scale with sharp fourth scale degree exclusively. Charles-Valentin Alkan's Allegro barbaro (√âtude Op. 35, No. 5, published in 1848) is written strictly in F Lydian, with no B's present at all (,). Anton Bruckner employed the sharpened fourth of the Lydian scale in his motet Os justi (1879) more strictly than Renaissance composers ever did when writing in this mode . Modern In the 20th century, composers began once again to exploit modal scales with some frequency. George Enescu, for example, includes Lydian-mode passages in the second and third movements of his 1906 Decet for Winds, Op. 14 . An example from the middle of the century is the scherzo movement of Carlos Ch√°vez's Symphony No. 3 (1951‚Äì54). The movement opens with a fugue subject, featuring extremely wide leaps, in C Lydian with following entries in F and G Lydian . Jazz In Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization, George Russell developed a theory that became highly influential in the jazz world, inspiring the works of people such as Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, and Woody Shaw Popular *\\"Waltz #1\\" from the 1998 album XO by Elliott Smith (D Lydian). *Passage beginning at the words \\"Much as I definitely enjoy solitude\\" in the song \\"Possibly Maybe\\" by Bj√∂rk . *XTC's \\"Jason and the Argonauts\\" from their English Settlement album . *Walk Away Ren√©e by The Left Banke Folk * Many Polish folksongs, including the mazurka, are in the Lydian mode; the first six notes of this mode were sometimes known as the \\"Polish mode\\" .

Boulton was drafted 234th overall in the ninth round of the 1994 draft by the New York Rangers. While he never played for the Rangers, he played for the Buffalo Sabres, Atlanta Thrashers, New Jersey Devils and New York Islanders. Playing career Boulton was drafted in the ninth round, 234th overall by the New York Rangers in the 1994 draft of the National Hockey League (NHL). Despite being drafted by the Rangers, he would eventually make his NHL debut playing for the Buffalo Sabres, where he played for four seasons. During the 2004 NHL Lockout, he played for the Columbia Inferno of the ECHL. After the Lockout ended, Boulton began playing with the Atlanta Thrashers. In October 2005, Boulton was suspended for six games after elbowing Tampa Bay Lightning rookie Paul Ranger, causing a hairline fracture of the jaw and a concussion. The incident occurred at the end of a 6‚Äì0 rout of the Thrashers on October 20, 2005. NHL vice-president Colin Campbell said, \\"It is clear Mr. Boulton's actions were careless and caused injury. There is no circumstance that can justify this type of action.\\" Only a week earlier, Boulton had made a similar move in a game against the Toronto Maple Leafs, almost injuring Eric Lindros. Boulton was re-signed by the Thrashers in 2008 to a two-year deal. He recorded his first career hat trick on December 18, 2010, against the New Jersey Devils. He then signed as an unrestricted free agent with the Devils for a 2-year contract worth $575,000 in the first year and $750,000 in the second, joining former Thrashers teammates Ilya Kovalchuk and Johan Hedberg. After a dismal season in which the Devils did not record a single goal for with Boulton on the ice, Boulton was bought out of the final year of his contract on June 30, 2012. The next day, Boulton proceeded to sign a one-year deal with the New York Islanders. He re-signed with the Islanders for the next three consecutive seasons as well, all on one-year deals. Boulton is the Thrashers' all-time leader in penalty minutes. After the 2016‚Äì17 season, Boulton ended his professional career, however continued his association with the Islanders in accepting a scouting role.

Most incarnations of the character possess clay-like bodies and shapeshifting abilities, and all of them have been depicted as adversaries of the superhero Batman. In 2009, Clayface was ranked as IGN's 73rd-greatest comic book villain of all time.Clayface is number 73 , IGN Basil Karlo appeared on the television series Gotham played by Brian McManamon. Clayface also appears as a main character in the animated series Harley Quinn voiced by Alan Tudyk. Publication history Created by Bill Finger and Bob Kane, the original Clayface (Basil Karlo) appeared in Detective Comics #40 (June 1940) as a B-list actor who began a life of crime using the identity of a villain that he had portrayed in a horror film. The character only appeared twice in the Golden Age, but was the inspiration for the shape-shifting Silver Age version. In the late 1950s, Batman began facing a series of science fiction-inspired foes, including Matt Hagen, a treasure hunter given vast shapeshifting powers and resiliency by exposure to a pool of radioactive protoplasm, who became the second Clayface. He retained the title for the next several decades of comic book history. In the late 1970s, Preston Payne became the third Clayface. A scientist suffering from hyperpituitarism, Preston Payne used the second Clayface's blood to create a cure for his condition, but instead became a clay-like creature that needed to pass his new condition on to others to survive. Sondra Fuller of Strike Force Kobra used the terrorist group's technology to become the fourth Clayface, also known as Lady Clay. She formed the Mud Pack with the original and third Clayfaces. During this era, the original Clayface used the DNA of Payne and Fuller to become the Ultimate Clayface (as he now called himself). Sometime after the Mud Pack event, Payne and Fuller had a son named Cassius \\"Clay\\" Payne, who, as the fifth Clayface, also had metahuman shapeshifting powers. In a 1998 storyline, Dr. Peter Malloy later used a sample of Cassius Payne's skin to become a Claything when he was introduced in Batman #550 (January 1998). In 2002, the Todd Russell version of Clayface was introduced in Catwoman vol. 3, #4 (May 2002), and in 2005, the Johnny Williams version of Clayface was introduced in Batman: Gotham Knights #60 (February 2005). Fictional character biography Basil Karlo The original version of Clayface, Basil Karlo, first appeared in Detective Comics #40 (June 1940). He is a B-list actor who is driven insane when he hears that a remake of the classic horror film he had starred in, Dread Castle, would be shot without him acting in the film, even though he is to be one of the advising staff. Donning the costume of Clayface, a villain he once played in a different movie, he begins killing the actors playing characters he killed in the order and way they die in the film, along with someone who knew his identity. Last, he plans to murder the actor playing the Clayface killer. He is foiled by Batman and Robin. He reappears after the prison ambulance he is riding in plunges off a cliff. He once again dons the mask of Clayface and targets Bruce Wayne's fianc√©e, Julie Madison. Once again, the Dynamic Duo foil his plans. A movie buff, Batman co-creator Bob Kane states that the character was partially inspired by the 1925 Lon Chaney, Sr. version of The Phantom of the Opera and that the name of the character came from a combination of Boris Karloff and Basil Rathbone. Karlo returns twice more in the Silver Age of Comics to battle Batman, in Batman #208 and Detective Comics #496. In the Post-Crisis continuity, Karlo languishes in a prison hospital, when the current Clayface Sondra Fuller visits him out of curiosity. Karlo proposes an alliance between all living Clayfaces to kill Batman. He even arranges for a small piece of the remains of Matt Hagen to be gathered to make him a post-mortem member of the \\"Mud Pack\\", as the group called itself. Even though the \\"Mud Pack\\" is defeated, Karlo injects himself with blood samples from Preston Payne and Sondra Fuller, gaining the abilities to shapeshift and melt with a touch; he becomes the self-declared \\"Ultimate\\" Clayface. He is defeated by the combined efforts of Batman and Looker of the Outsiders by overloading his abilities, making him melt into the ground. He literally sinks into the Earth's crust when he loses control of his powers; he survives, however, and now his body sports crystals similar to quartz that endow him with greater power. Karlo escapes his underground prison when Gotham City is struck by a great cataclysm. He captures Batman and is about to kill him, but he gets into a feud with Mr. Freeze about who has a right to kill the Caped Crusader. Using that distraction, Batman soundly defeats both of them. During the \\"No Man's Land\\" storyline, Karlo holds Poison Ivy, who is in charge of producing fresh vegetables for the remaining people in the city, prisoner in Robinson Park. After she is freed from her prison by Batman, Poison Ivy battles and defeats Karlo, sinking him deep into the ground. It appears that the Ultimate Clayface is destroyed in this battle, but he resurfaces as a member of the Secret Society of Super Villains. Later, he seeks to increase his already formidable powers by absorbing Wonder Woman (a clay construct similar to him), giving him an amount of powers that border on invulnerability. While he is successful in absorbing some of the heroine's powers, causing her to regress to a teenage appearance resembling Donna Troy, he is ultimately returned to normal when Wonder Woman and Donna were able to trick Clayface into entering a train carriage with Wonder Woman while she was disguised as Donna, Donna subsequently using the Lasso of Truth to swing the carriage around and turn it into a mystical centrifuge, causing the clay Clayface had taken from Wonder Woman to split away from him and re-merge with Wonder Woman due to the differences between the two types of clay. Basil Karlo is among the members of the Injustice League and is among the villains seen in Salvation Run. He can also be seen as a member of Libra's Secret Society of Super Villains. In the second issue of Final Crisis, he triggers an explosion at the Daily Planet under Libra's orders when Lex Luthor orders Libra to do something that will draw Superman to them. Black Mask attempts to control Karlo by implanting a device in his body. He escapes Black Mask, but is captured and imprisoned by the Outsiders. In The New 52 (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), as a part of the \\"Death of the Family\\" storyline, Poison Ivy breaks Basil Karlo out of Arkham, claiming she wants to marry him.Detective Comics #14 This turns out to be a ruse, however; Ivy is using him as part of a larger scheme. Upon realizing this, he seeks revenge.Detective Comics #15. DC Comics. Karlo later returns with a new plan: to use his DNA-duplication abilities to impersonate Bruce Wayne and take control of Wayne Enterprises. He even guesses that Wayne is Batman's true identity. However, Batman plants false evidence to suggest that he anticipated Karlo's attempt to take his DNA and tricked him into taking a fake sample. Batman eventually stops Karlo by trapping him in a security system that can only be deactivated with Karlo's original DNA, reasoning that he has changed too much for his original DNA to be present in his system.Batman #20 (July 2013). DC Comics. In Detective Comics Annual 2018, Basil is re-imaged as a handsome young actor who was disfigured in a car accident. In a desperate bid to salvage his career, he began abusing an industrial make-up chemical known as \\"Re-Nu\\" which, when combined with clay and putty, warps flesh into new shapes and forms; a secret he discovered from his father Vincent Karlo, a former special effects artist. However, the chemical is long out of production, and Karlo is forced to steal more and more of it to preserve his handsome appearance. Batman apprehends him during one such robbery, which reveals his secret to the world. Karlo's career is ruined and his girlfriend Glory Griffin dumps him. Batman attempts to get Karlo to testify against the creator of Re-Nu, Roland Daggett, but he refuses. Instead, he attempts to break into the warehouse where the police are holding his stolen stash of Re-Nu. When police open fire on the vials, Karlo is doused in the chemical and transformed into Clayface. He then attacks the set of the film he was fired from. Batman attempts to evacuate the set, but Clayface flings him off into the distance and begins massacring everyone in sight. As an added bit of revenge, Clayface disfigures Glory, who is working on the film as a production assistant, before Batman apprehends him. This incident leads Glory to become Mudface of the Victim Syndicate.Detective Comics #943. DC Comics. DC Comics.

Cassius \\"Clay\\" Payne Cassius \\"Clay\\" Payne as Clayface After the Mud Pack incident, Payne and Fuller escape and fall in love while on the run. They eventually have a child together named Cassius \\"Clay\\" Payne, who becomes the fifth version of Clayface and debuted in Batman #550.Batman #550 The boy is separated from his parents and held in a government laboratory. The name \\"Cassius\\" is a pun on \\"Cassius Clay\\", the birth name of boxer Muhammad Ali. If a piece of him is separated from his body, it can grow a mind of its own, but it mostly thinks in an unstable form of what Cassius wants. If bonded with another human, it becomes a Claything; the piece can give that human Clayface-like abilities, such as becoming soft and malleable, being able to withstand bullets and other forms of harm, and could also manifest Payne's ability to melt objects; all this person would have to do to perform such an action is to think about it. Cassius finds it very painful and distressing to have pieces of himself taken, and will go to crazed lengths to recover them. When Thomas Elliot attempted to give himself the shapeshifting abilities of the Clayfaces, he determined that Cassius is the only 'pure' Clayface in existence, as all others retain fragments of their former human DNA where Cassius is the only Clayface that was never anything but his current state. In an issue of Batman: Gotham Knights, Cassius is depicted as having the clay-like appearance of his mother and father, but can only stay in this form while awake (a similar trait shared by Plasmus in the Teen Titans animated series (2003‚Äì2006)).Batman: Gotham After Midnight #3‚Äì4.

Claything is destroyed when Cameron Chase psychokinetically turns his own powers against him, and his remains are stored at the D.E.O. Headquarters.Batman #550. DC Comics. Todd Russell The seventh version of Clayface, Todd Russell, debuted in Catwoman (vol. 3) #1 (January 2002), but is not actually shown until Catwoman (vol. 3) #4 (May 2002). This version of Clayface is not named until Catwoman (vol. 3) #44. Having the power to change into virtually any shape and size, he preys upon prostitutes in Gotham's East End until Catwoman is able to contain his severed head inside of a freezer. There are very few background details given about the seventh Clayface's past. He was in the Army, suffered injuries, and was subsequently experimented on (possibly by the DEO) before losing most of his memory and discovering his new powers.

Just then, he is approached by Hush and the Riddler, who tell him that the chemicals turned him into the latest Clayface. They begin to manipulate Williams, holding out the promise of a cure and making him do their bidding, including pretending to be Tommy Elliot (Hush's true identity) and an adult Jason Todd, to hurt and confuse Bruce Wayne.Batman #614. DC Comics.Batman #617‚Äì618. DC Comics. Elliot also takes some samples from Williams to try and determine how he can duplicate the shapeshifting aspects of Clayface without losing his original form, also using these samples to infect Batman's ally Alfred Pennyworth with a virus that allows Hush to exert some degree of control over Alfred, forcing him to commit murder. Eventually, Williams realizes he is being manipulated and Hush will never help him after Hush tries to steal a sample of Cassius in the hopes that analysis of the 'pure' Clayface will help him crack the sample. Knowing that he is going to die, Williams offers Batman assistance against Hush in exchange for protecting his family. He redeems himself in his death by providing Batman with a sample of himself so that Batman can find a cure for the virus infecting Alfred, also ensuring that Alfred is cleared of the murder charges by ensuring that his final appearance after death includes fingerprints that are so similar to Alfred's that the detectives conclude that they simply made a mistake.Batman: Gotham Knight #69‚Äì71.

In The New 52, these are improved to a level in which he can even mimic the DNA of others. * Matt Hagen had temporary shapeshifting, voiceshifting, and a body constituted of living mud which he can divide or change shape at will. Hagen had to reimmerse himself in a pool of protoplasm that gave him his powers to recharge them every 48 hours or else he would regress back to his human form. Later he duplicated the protoplasm by scientific means, but it would only give him his powers for five hours before needing to be renewed. * Preston Payne originally had shapeshifting powers, yet ended up gaining the ability to dissolve people with his touch. He has super-strength from his exoskeleton and anti-dissolving suit. Preston's shapeshifting ability was later restored by Prometheus. * Sondra Fuller has shapeshifting powers and power duplication. * Cassius \\"Clay\\" Payne has the combined powers of both his parents. If a piece of him is separated from his mass, it can develop some consciousness of its own and even \\"bond\\" with a human to transform them into a \\"Claything\\". * Dr. Peter Malley had the same powers as Cassius, but could also melt people just by looking at them. * Todd Russell had shapeshifting powers. * Johnny Williams had shapeshifting powers.

Detective Comics #943 (vol. 1), December, 2016 She was later cured by Dr. October. Detective Comics #974 (vol. 1), April, 2018 Clownface Clownface began as a stray piece of Clayface's body that became unattached and gained enough sentience to morph itself into a mute old man. This man was found and taken to Arkham Manor because of his unresponsiveness. Arkham Manor #2 (vol. 1), November 26, 2014 Later, the Joker, infected this portion of Clayface with Joker Venom, morphing it into an entirely separate killing machine he called Clownface. Arkham Manor #3 (vol. 1), December 24, 2014 Other versions Batman 66 In Batman '66 (which is based on the 1960s TV series), the Basil Karlo name was used for the true identity of False Face.

It was also revealed that Karlo is still alive within the mud collected by GCPD, but is unable to take form again because of the Lazarus Particles mixed with his mud and the explosion from the generator. Batman: White Knight In the 2017 miniseries Batman: White Knight, an unnamed Clayface appears as a chief character. Criminal Jack Napier (a version of Joker who was temporarily cured of his insanity after being force-fed pills by Batman) uses the Mad Hatter's mind control technology to control Clayface, while slipping small particles from his body into the drinks of many of Batman's other villains. This allows Napier to control a small army of villains via this Clayface's ability to control parts of his body that had been separated from him. Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Clayface was briefly included in the cover of one of the first miniseries' issues, but did not feature in the story itself. In the third miniseries, he was blended with the character of Rocksteady, forming a Clayface who was a rhinoceros in his natural form. In other media Television =Live-action= * A character that resembles the Matt Hagen version of Clayface appears among the attacking criminals in the animated opening credits of the 60s Batman TV series, but the villain never actually appeared on the show itself and was instead replaced with the lesser-known, but similar-sounding, masked master of disguise called False Face portrayed by Malachi Throne. * Clayface made an appearance in the 12th episode of the short-lived Birds of Prey TV series, portrayed by Kirk Baltz. This version of Clayface is a sculptor named Cassius Payne who is inspired by other people's pain. Like other versions, he is a shapeshifter but his powers are explained to come from taking a special formula specifically tailored by a crooked scientist to work with his DNA. In this series, he is hired by the Joker to kill Catwoman. His son Chris Cassius (portrayed by Ian Reed Kesler) can turn people into clay after stealing and taking his father's formula, making his powers similar to the Preston Payne version of Clayface and his own son Cassius \\"Clay\\" Payne. Clayface escaped from Arkham Asylum where he confronted his son at a gala as the Birds of Prey also show up. Chris is eventually defeated by Helena Kyle. Clayface expected Huntress to kill Chris only for Oracle to talk him into sparing his son's life. Clayface then allowed himself to be arrested by the police. * The Basil Karlo version of Clayface appears in Gotham, portrayed by Brian McManamon. This version of the character is a deceased actor who was revived from the dead by Hugo Strange and Ethel Peabody at the underground Indian Hill facility.

He debuts in the second-season episode \\"A Legion of Horribles\\", in which Strange introduces him to Jim Gordon, and then places Basil in a machine that replicates Gordon's visage onto his face. In the episode \\"Transference\\", Basil, disguised as Gordon, pulls the GCPD off of Arkham. However, Barbara Kean discovers he is not Gordon due to his behavior and slaps him in the face, deforming Basil's face and exposing him as an impostor in front of all the department. In the third season episode \\"Ghosts\\", Edward Nygma makes him pose as the ghost of Oswald Cobblepot's father in order to drive him mad. In the episode \\"Nothing's Shocking,\\" Basil was mentioned by Gordon and Bullock to be behind the murders of some detectives only to discover that it was actually Jane Cartwright. * The Clayface of Earth-99 was mentioned by that Earth's Batman in The CW crossover event, \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\" as having been turned into a puddle. =Animation= * The Matt Hagen version of Clayface made his first animated appearance in Filmation's 1970s TV series The New Adventures of Batman, voiced by Lou Scheimer and later by Lennie Weinrib. This version must apply his special potion daily to keep his Clayface powers. In this show, he often took on the forms of animals. In \\"Dead Ringers\\", Clayface, in his true form of Matt Hagen, forces former criminal-turned-acrobat Kit Martin to help him in exchange for not telling his boss of his criminal record. The plot involves posing as Batman in order to kidnap the Arabian Oil Minister Basil Oram. They disguise themselves as Batman and Robin, capture Oram and escape in a special shapeshifting vehicle. Clayface later calls Commissioner Gordon, stating that he will return Oram and the blueprints for an oil-finding device in exchange for $10 million by the end of the first hour. Clayface then orchestrates a car accident that knocks out Batman and then stows away in the Batmobile in order to infiltrate the Batcave. Clayface then discovers that Batman has amnesia and uses this advantage to find out Batman's secret identity, but his plan is foiled when Bat-Mite distracts him long enough for the Bat-Computer to create an antidote for Batman's amnesia. Clayface sneaks out of the Batcave disguised as a rabbit with Bat-Mite in pursuit while Robin and Batgirl learn why Kit is involved with Clayface's kidnapping plot. Batman used the Bat-Boat to pursue Clayface when he escapes into the water in the form of a dolphin. After Kit returns the blueprints to Commissioner Gordon, Robin and Batgirl learn from Kit that he was to deliver a 'medicine' to Clayface before midnight. When Clayface's shapeshifting wears off, he reverts to Matt Hagen and begins to drown as Hagen cannot swim, until Batman saves him and hands him over to the police. In \\"Curses! Oiled Again\\", Clayface collaborates with Catwoman to steal a shipment of oil bound for Gotham City during a cold snap. They also plan to steal the country's oil supply. When Batman and Robin scout out each of the storage tanks in the south side and the waterfront, Batman finds Catwoman and Clayface at the oil storage tanks on the waterfront and is led into a trap where Clayface attacks Batman in the form of a snake. Catwoman appears and shows Batman how she and Clayface have been draining the oil from Gotham City. Batman breaks free from Clayface when Robin, Batgirl and Bat-Mite arrive. Clayface turns into an eagle to get Catwoman away from Batman. Catwoman and Clayface manage to lose Batman, Robin, Batgirl and Bat-Mite in a car chase when the Kitty Car jumps over Batgirl. Catwoman and Clayface intercept a call between Batman and Commissioner Gordon revolving around the oil supertanker arriving in Gotham City. Catwoman and Clayface manage to steal some of the oil and escape in their submarine as Catwoman flees in her plane. Clayface turns into a whale in order to attack Batman and Robin. Batman and Robin net Clayface, who turns into a flying fish to get out, only to be caught in a smaller net by Robin. In the two-part episode \\"Have an Evil Day\\", Zarbor enlists the Joker, Penguin, Catwoman and Clayface to keep the Dynamic Duo busy while he steals America's nuclear power plants. * The DC animated universe featured the Matt Hagen version of Clayface, voiced by Golden Globe winner Ron Perlman. ** Matt Hagen is introduced in the critically acclaimed 1990s series Batman: The Animated Series. In the episode \\"Feat of Clay\\" (written by veteran comic book writer Marv Wolfman), Hagen is an actor who was disfigured in a horrible car accident. While Hagen was recovering in a hospital's burn wing, corrupt businessman Roland Daggett approached him offered to make him as a test subject for the beauty cream 'Renuyu', promising that it would immediately restore his youthful good looks compared to years of plastic surgery. As the effects are temporary and the cream is highly addictive, Hagen is used to commit crimes for Daggett. After Hagen botches an attack on Lucius Fox while disguised as Bruce Wayne, Daggett cuts off his supply. Hagen attempts to steal a large quantity of Renuyu from Daggett's compound, but Daggett's men catch him and pour an entire canister of Renuyu down Hagen's throat and leave him for dead. The overdose saturates every cell in Hagen's body, turning him into the bulky and misshapen clay-like form of Clayface. For short periods of time, he can shapeshift into anything or anybody he wishes. Clayface tries to get revenge on Daggett, but Batman stops him by overwhelming his powers with images of his past film roles. When caught, Clayface fakes his death (with the body in the morgue turning out to be a hollow shell which dries up and breaks apart) and sneaks away in the form of a woman. The episode \\"Mudslide\\" shows Clayface reappearing and revealing that his body is beginning to deteriorate. He is restored to a semblance of health by Dr. Stella Bates (voiced by Pat Musick), a former medical adviser on one of Hagen's films who fell in love with him. Batman tracks him down and prevents Clayface's treatment. Clayface and Batman then fight on a cliff during a rainstorm above an ocean. They both fall, and hang onto the cliff. Batman attempts to save Clayface, but Clayface's body absorbs too much rain to hold itself up and he falls into the ocean, where he dissolves. ** Clayface returns in The New Batman Adventures. Clayface makes a brief appearance in the pilot episode \\"Holiday Knights\\", where he takes the form of several little boys to steal items during a Christmas Eve rush. Upon being caught, he reverts to his natural form and attacks Detectives Harvey Bullock and Renee Montoya, but is defeated by Batgirl. The episode \\"Growing Pains\\" reveals that after falling into the ocean during the events of \\"Mudslide\\", Clayface's remains drift near a pipe leaking strange chemicals into the ocean, restoring his strength. Still weakened, Clayface sends a portion of himself which takes the form of a little girl named Annie (voiced by Francesca Marie Smith) to see if it safe for him to resurface. She develops an individual personality, wandering around Gotham with no memory of who she is, and encounters Robin. As Robin develops an affection for Annie, Clayface poses as the girl's abusive father, committing various robberies in order to make a living in Gotham's sewers. Eventually, Clayface recovers, cornering Robin and Annie; the latter allows herself to be reabsorbed‚Äîeffectively killing her‚Äîin order to save Robin. Enraged by Annie's 'death', Robin almost kills Clayface with gallons of solvent, but Batman intervenes and stops him. Clayface is then arrested and imprisoned in Arkham Asylum. When Commissioner Gordon lists the charges Clayface is accused of, Robin quietly adds murder as one of them. ** Clayface is also featured in the Justice League animated series. The episode \\"Secret Society\\" revealed he had been captured, separated and sealed into several biohazard canisters by Morgan Edge. The Secret Society free Clayface and offer him membership. Now less aggressive and psychopathic than before, Clayface is reluctant at first as he just wants to be human again. Gorilla Grodd promises to find a way to help Hagen return to his human form while keeping his shapeshifting powers which Hagen finds appealing even when Gorilla Grodd mentioned how Giganta used to be a gorilla. During the showdown at Gotham Stadium, Clayface is defeated along with the rest of the group after Flash and Hawkgirl stuff him with fireworks and set them off. * There are two versions of Clayface that appear on The Batman cartoon series: original character Ethan Bennett (voiced by Steve Harris), and Basil Karlo (voiced by Wallace Langham in \\"Clayfaces\\", Lex Lang in \\"The Batman/Superman Story\\"). The first incarnation (introduced in season one) is a detective in the Gotham City Police Department and Bruce Wayne's best friend. The second incarnation (introduced in season four) is a talentless actor. After a session of brainwashing, Ethan is rescued by Batman and Detective Ellen Yin. However, he turns into Clayface when he inhales a dose of the Joker's \\"Joker Putty.\\" After publicly denouncing Chief Angel Rojas's claims about Batman and getting suspended, Bennett mutates into a featureless gray clay-like figure and tries to look for help, scaring away the locals, though Ethan manages to change back into his original form with practice. While trying to murder Rojas, Clayface confronts Yin and Batman. In season two, Bennett appears primarily as Clayface. In the episode \\"Meltdown\\", Clayface is captured and put on trial for his crimes after an attempt on Joker's life. Despite being released on probation, criminal temptations are too severe for Bennett. In the episode \\"Grundy's Night\\", Clayface impersonates Solomon Grundy in order to loot Gotham on Halloween, but is ultimately stopped by Batman. In season four, Bennett has a change of heart while Karlo appears as Clayface. In the episode \\"Clayfaces\\", Bennett seems to have finally reformed by tracking down and capturing the Joker, disguising himself as Joker's henchmen Punch and Judy. He hands the Joker over to the police without using excessive force and turns himself in to the authorities. Now in Arkham Asylum, Bennett wants to return working as a police officer, even as Clayface. However, Karlo breaks into Wayne Enterprises and drinks a refined, purified sample of the same mutagen that Bennett was exposed to. This successfully turns Karlo into a new version of Clayface and he gives him a more conventional appearance. After being rejected once again, Karlo snaps and uses his new powers to attack the people who rejected him. Karlo initially believes this would be the death of his career, but then he sees that being a supervillain has made him a celebrity covered on nearly every channel as well as the showing of his previous movie The Revenge of The Atomic Clone. As Karlo was wreaking havoc, Bennett resorts to escaping from Arkham, wanting to stop his successor. Bennett tracks down and battles Karlo with the aid of Batman and Robin. Bennett then restrains Karlo down while Batman administers the successful antidote, thus both Bennett and Karlo are cured and returned to Arkham. Ethan planned to finish his sentence and visited by Bruce, stating that they should play basketball again. Since the antidote finally cured all of his mutated cells, Ethan will eventually be free. He is also glad that his powers are gone, removing his criminal temptations so that he can focus on reformation after witnessing Karlo's actions. However, the episode's final scene shows that Karlo has retained his powers. The episode \\"Artifacts\\" (which takes place 20 years in the future) has Bennett reinstated into the GCPD as Chief of Police. In season five's \\"The Batman/Superman Story\\", Karlo reappears as Clayface when he and Black Mask are hired by Lex Luthor to kidnap Lois Lane as bait for a trap to lure Superman so that Bane and Mr. Freeze can attack Superman at once. Clayface managed to pull this off by posing as Clark Kent to get close to her. Superman defeats the villains with Batman and Robin's help, but Clayface escapes. Clayface later fights Batman and Robin in LexCorp's Gotham headquarters and ends up defeated. Basil Karlo is the first Clayface but he is the second in the show. * The Preston Payne version of Clayface is featured in Batman: The Brave and the Bold. In the episode \\"Joker: The Vile and the Villainous!\\", a portrait of Clayface is seen in the villain bar where Batman's Rogues Gallery hangs out called the 8-Bar. * The Matt Hagen version of Clayface appears in the Young Justice animated series, voiced by Nolan North. In \\"Downtime\\", he is seen at the beginning where he overpowers the entire team and is about to kill Aqualad until Batman intervenes and quickly subdues him with a taser, which causes Clayface to dissolve into a puddle. He was later taken to Arkham Asylum. In \\"Happy New Year\\", Clayface encounters Miss Martian and Superboy in the sewers, where he attacks Superboy with the same tactics he used before. By this point, he has become immune to the tasers Robin uses. Superboy uses a special pill to freeze Clayface. He is then returned to Arkham. He returns in Young Justice: Outsiders in where he is under mind control by Mad Hatter. Robin frees him from the mind control. In the audio play \\"Prize\\" which is set between seasons 3 and 4, he is now an employee at Bow Hunter Securities and had changed his name to Harlan Matthews. He is kidnapped by the Suicide Squad. * A female version of the character named Mrs. Clayface appears in DC Super Hero Girls, voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson. She is the wife of the as-yet-unidentified Clayface. * The Basil Karlo version of Clayface is a main character in DC Universe's adult animation series Harley Quinn, voiced by Alan Tudyk. In this comedic incarnation, Clayface is stated to be a classically trained yet terrible actor who turned into a shapeshifting mass of clay after \\"a terrible pottery accident\\". Introduced in the episode \\"So, You Need a Crew?\\", Clayface is shown to be considered a lesser villain in Gotham City's underworld and, as such, is working in a bar, until being recruited into Harley Quinn's crew, making him a regular character throughout the rest of the series. In the episode \\"You're a Damn Good Cop, Jim Gordon\\", it is shown that his right hand (voiced by Tom Kenny) can separate from the rest of his body and develop a personality of its own. Film * The unidentified Flashpoint version of Clayface appears in Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox. He is part of Deathstroke's pirate crew that fights Aquaman's army until he is killed by Ocean Master. * The Basil Karlo version of Clayface appears in Batman Unlimited: Monster Mayhem, voiced by Dave B. Mitchell. Clayface has joined the Joker's gang of monsters to wreak mayhem on Gotham City. * The Basil Karlo version of Clayface appears in Batman Unlimited: Mechs vs. Mutants, voiced again by Dave B. Mitchell. Clayface, Killer Croc, Chemo, and Bane are freed from Arkham by Mr. Freeze and the Penguin. Freeze uses a serum to turn Chemo and Croc into giant monsters. Meanwhile, the treacherous Penguin enlists Clayface and Bane to help with a coup against Freeze. Penguin injects them with the serum and Bane throws Freeze across Gotham. Clayface goes after Batman and Robin, but the serum turns Clayface into a lava monster. Using a freeze ray developed by Freeze, Robin, the Flash, Man-Bat, and Nightwing freeze Clayface solid. However, Clayface is accidentally freed by some children and, back to his original form, escapes into the sewer. * The Basil Karlo version of Clayface appears in The Lego Batman Movie, voiced by Kate Micucci in a manly voice. He is among the villains that assist Joker in his takeover of Gotham City. During the ceremony where Barbara Gordon is being sworn in as the new police commissioner, Joker assigns Mr. Freeze and Clayface to capture her. Barbara tricks Mr. Freeze into freezing Clayface. During the fight against the Phantom Zone inmates, Mr. Freeze and Clayface defeat the Kraken from Clash of the Titans. * The Basil Karlo version of Clayface appears in Scooby-Doo! & Batman: The Brave and the Bold, voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson. * The Basil Karlo version of Clayface appears in Batman: Hush, voiced by Adam Gifford. Riddler uses Clayface to impersonate him when Batman comes to Arkham Asylum to interrogate him about Hush. When Batman figures out Clayface's ruse, he was able to defeat him. Video games =Lego= * The Basil Karlo version of Clayface appears in Lego Batman: The Videogame, with his vocal effects provided by Ogie Banks. He is a lieutenant of the Riddler and the first boss of Chapter 1 \\"The Riddler's Revenge\\". The Riddler assigns him to steal a key from Gotham Bank, and the two of them blow up the bank vault containing the key. In the villain campaign, he gives the key to the Riddler, and then he notices the gold bars, and plays around with them, even building a house out of them‚Äîwhich appears as a minikit. In the hero campaign, he is looking at a silver bar, then he prepares to battle Batman and Robin. However, the Dynamic Duo defeats him by blowing up the silver Lego objects he stands by, and using a batarang to spray gas and make him fall into the cage that contained the key, where Robin apprehends him. When Batman chases the Riddler, he makes Batman trip, but the Riddler leaves without him. In the ending cutscene, he is seen in Arkham Asylum making cups out of clay. His two abilities are super strength and double jump, and he is the only one of the Riddler's followers (excluding the Riddler himself) that is not immune to toxins. His look and structure is that of the Matt Hagen version from the DC Animated Universe (though his biography says differently).Game Informer features a two-page gallery of the many heroes and villains who appear in the game with a picture for each character and a descriptive paragraph. See \\"LEGO Batman: Character Gallery\\", Game Informer 186 (October 2008): 93 His actions and mannerisms suggest a low level of intelligence, e.g. when he steals the key in the villain campaign, he tries to cram the key horizontally through the opening of the cage until the Riddler rotates it vertically. In the DS version, the Matt Hagen version appears instead of the Basil Karlo version despite having the same design as Karlo. * The Basil Karlo version of Clayface makes an appearance in Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes, voiced by Fred Tatasciore. He appears as a boss fight and unlockable character, found in an alley behind Gotham Bank. Before the fight, he says, \\"My mom told me I could be anything I wanted. Anything!\\" (which is true after gaining his powers). * The Basil Karlo version of Clayface appears in Lego Dimensions. He appears in The Lego Batman Movie adventure pack as the third boss. * The Basil Karlo version of Clayface appears as one of the main characters in Lego DC Super-Villains, voiced again by Fred Tatasciore. In comparison to the first two games where he was a mini- figure, Clayface is redesigned with a transformation ability to become a big figure. He first appears acting as a street performer when the Joker and Harley Quinn pick him up. The Joker then sends him, the Riddler, and Scarecrow to attack Gotham City Police Department to get the Joker's joy buzzer and their own stuff. Batgirl (Barbara Gordon) and Nightwing (Dick Grayson) show up to stop them, but Catwoman and Two-Face KO them. They take off in the Joker's van, and they crash into the Iceberg Lounge. Clayface then fights alongside Catwoman against Nightwing and Batgirl. Clayface later goes with Joker, Harley Quinn, and Sinestro to Gotham Museum where into turns into a potted plant to sneak around in order to find and recruit Black Adam without running into the Crime Syndicate. Here he's shown to have a massive appetite; as in one of the cutscenes, he eats all the food set on the table. =Batman: Arkham= The Basil Karlo iteration of Clayface can be seen in the Batman: Arkham video game franchise, primarily voiced by Rick D. Wasserman. * Clayface can be seen in Batman: Arkham Asylum. Never seen in his true form, he is shown changing into the various likenesses of Commissioner Gordon and Quincy Sharp (both voiced by Tom Kane) as well as Aaron Cash (voiced by Duane R. Shepard Sr.) while asking to be let out of his cell (behind a strong glass wall smeared in clay). His biography states he is Basil Karlo, although the presence of a mannequin in the cell hints at Preston Payne's relationship with \\"Helena\\". His profile is obtained by scanning him (revealing that he has no visible skeleton unlike all other characters who are scanned), solving the Riddler's riddle: \\"A case of mistaken identity?\\" After he is revealed, Clayface stays in Gordon's form for the remainder of the game and only laughs diabolically when the player tries talking to him. When the player returns to the Penitentiary section and finds Warden Sharp gone with the final Arkham Chronicles inscribed on the floor, Clayface as Gordon states that the warden left in a hurry. He is also one of the villains who is listed on the party list. * Clayface appears in Batman: Arkham City. He is seen present throughout the game, posing as a healthy version of Joker (voiced by Mark Hamill) to draw attention away from the dying Clown Prince of Crime. Scanning a poster of The Terror (a reference to Karlo's first appearance) outside the Monarch Theatre reveals that Clayface had escaped Arkham Island after the events of the previous game by posing as Quincy Sharp, and had been on the run from Hugo Strange ever since. The plot is revealed after Clayface as Joker is impaled and supposedly killed by Talia al Ghul. Batman then realizes what has happened, only for Talia to be shot and killed by the real Joker. Finally Clayface reveals himself and takes the cure for the Titan toxin, causing Batman to be highly shocked, as Karlo was not even an inmate of Arkham City. He is the game's final boss, where he reverts to his true form for the fight. Clayface says that he joined up with Joker for the chance to play \\"the role of a lifetime\\" before brutally attacking Batman with a series of shapeshifting attacks and spawning miniature Clayfaces. Joker destroys the floor of the Monarch Theatre, sending the combatants into the Lazarus Chamber. There, Batman defeats Clayface and retrieves the cure using freezing grenades and Talia's sword. * In the prequel Batman: Arkham Origins, posters for a Basil Karlo comedy are seen next to Monarch Theater. * Although Basil Karlo does not appear in Batman: Arkham Knight, he is referenced in movie posters for The Terror that can be found in Panessa Studios. Several other versions are referenced via a poster of a movie named Dark Interlude starring Matt Hagen and Stella Bates (a reference to the character from the Batman: The Animated Series episode \\"Mudslide\\") found in the clock tower as well as other co-stars Preston Payne and Sondra Fuller. =Other games= * The Matt Hagen version of Clayface appears as the final boss of the Sega CD version of The Adventures of Batman & Robin, although he takes on the appearance of Rupert Thorne throughout the game's majority, having hired other villains such as the Joker, Poison Ivy and Riddler to stall Batman and Robin. He is fought in an aerial battle while fleeing in a helicopter from the Batwing. In the end, Batman damages the helicopter and it crashes into a bridge. Clayface falls into the river below and dissolves. The game's cutscenes have since come to be known as the infamous \\"Lost Episode\\" of Batman: The Animated Series, though it is not considered canonical to the DC Animated Universe. * The Matt Hagen version of Clayface appears on the final level of SNES version of The Adventures of Batman & Robin. He appears as one of several villains trying to take down Batman. * The Matt Hagen version of Clayface is the second boss of Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu, again voiced again by Ron Perlman. Along with Scarecrow and Bane, he is manipulated by Sin Tzu into escaping Arkham Asylum and challenging Batman. Clayface takes over a chemical factory, intending to mutate Gotham's citizens into clay like himself, hoping that this will leave them more likely to search for a cure. * The Basil Karlo version of Clayface appears in DC Universe Online, voiced by Benjamin Jansen. He attacks Gotham S.C.U. until the players activate a containment unit to trap Clayface. In the villain campaign, the players free Clayface from his containment unit. The players also confront Clayface again in the Old Gotham Subway duo instance, where he first appears taking the shape of Two-Face. After defeating him, Two-Face tells the player through communicator that \\"the Penguin must have promised him a cure for his unfortunate condition. He has not yet learned that the cure is worse than the disease\\". * Although he does not make an appearance as Clayface, Basil Karlo is referenced in Gotham City Impostors. There are posters on both sides of the theatre that depict a masked man, above of which are the words \\"Basil Karlo in...\\" * The Basil Karlo version of Clayface is mentioned in Injustice 2. He is mentioned during Poison Ivy's fight dialogue with her own doppelganger who is mistaken for being Clayface's disguise. Miscellaneous * In The Batman Adventures #9, Clayface makes a cameo in a flashback sequence along other Batman rogues.The Batman Adventures #9 He finally returns in issue #14, revealing that he survived the fireworks explosion in the Justice League episode \\"Secret Society\\" and decides to finish off Batman and the Gray Ghost. However, at the end, he gets mixed with concrete and ends up becoming a statue of the Gray Ghost, ending his threat once and for all.The Batman Adventures #14 * Issue #12 of the comic book tie-in to Young Justice (which serves as a prequel to the episode \\"Downtime\\") reveals Matt Hagen/Clayface's back story as a mediocre member of the League of Shadows who romances Talia al Ghul. After her father Ra's al Ghul reluctantly gives the couple his blessing, Hagen reveals that he has cancer and uses her to heal himself in the Lazarus Pit. After he is submerged, Talia takes revenge on him by locking him there for months. After Ra's al Ghul uses the Pit, Hagen emerges mutated and insane and attacks Talia, only to be subdued by Ra's al Ghul and Sensei. After convincing Clayface to sleep, Ra's al Ghul uses him against Batman in Gotham upon having Sensei dropping Clayface off in Gotham while demanding an explanation from Talia about how Clayface came to be. Clayface's attack leads up to the team's battle with him in the sewers. In issue #13, Clayface secretly studies the team and takes down Superboy, Miss Martian, Kid Flash, and Robin in each trap. Before Clayface can finish off Aqualad, Batman intervenes and quickly subdues him with a stronger taser, which causes Clayface to dissolve into a puddle.

The breed has a very long body, short legs, and a distinctive topknot of hair on the head. They are friendly but tough, and are suitable for interaction with older children. There are no breed-specific health concerns, but they can be affected by spinal problems due to their elongated body, and the breed is affected by canine cancer at a higher than average rate. The breed is named after a fictional character in Sir Walter Scott's novel, Guy Mannering. This character, Dandie Dinmont, is thought to be partly based on James Davidson, who is credited as the originator of the modern breed. Davidson's dogs descended from earlier terrier-owning families, including the Allans of Holystone, Northumberland. There are three breed clubs in the UK supporting the breed, although it is registered as a Vulnerable Native Breed by the Kennel Club due to its low number of puppy registrations per year.  History  A drawing of two Dandie Dinmont Terriers from 1859 The breed originates from the dogs being used in the border country of Scotland and England. During the 1600s, they were used for hunting badgers and otters. Whilst their ultimate origin remains unknown, dogs owned by the Allans of Holystone, Northumberland in the early 1700s are thought to have been involved in their early origins. These dogs may have been a type of Border Terrier,Cook (1885): p. 70 although other theories exist including the idea that they are a cross between Scottish Terriers and Skye Terriers. The head of this family was Willie \\"Piper\\" Allan, who was born in nearby Bellingham.Cook (1885): p. 5 He kept dogs for the hunting of otters. Lord Ravensworth once hired Allan to remove the otters from the pond in Eslington Park. Lord Ravensworth attempted to purchase one of Allan's dogs after he successfully removed the otters, which Allan refused.Cook (1885): p. 6 Allan died on 18 February 1779, and his dogs passed into the care of his son James.Cook (1885): p. 7 James's son eventually inherited the dogs and sold a dog named Old Pepper to Mr Francis Sommer who came from Town Yetholm on the Scottish side of the border. Old Pepper was descended from one of Willie Allan's dogs who had worked Lord Ravensworth's manor. The breed remained relatively unknown outside of the Borders until 1815 when Sir Walter Scott's novel Guy Mannering was published. Scott had spent time in the area whilst the Sheriff of Selkirkshire and had learned of the prowess of these types of specialist terriers for working both fox and otter. When he wrote Guy Mannering, he included a character by the name of Dandie Dinmont who owned a number of terriers named Pepper and Mustard after the colours of their coats. The Dinmont character was partly based on the real life farmer and terrier owner, James Davidson,Cook (1885): p. 8 who too used the generic terms of Pepper and Mustard for his dogs depending on their coats.Cook (1885): p. 9 Davidson's dogs came from a variety of sources including the dogs of the Allan, Anderson and Faas families.Cook (1885): p. 10Cook (1885): p. 14 Davidson documented his breeding, and he has been accepted as the originator of the modern breed.Cook (1885): p. 15 Dandie Dinmont Terrier circa 1915 Some interbreeding with other breeds took place in the mid-1800s, which may have introduced Dachshund blood into the breed,Cook (1885): p. 69 although certain breeders maintained pure-bred lines.Cook (1885): p. 28 The Dachshund theory was first introduced by John Henry Walsh under the pseudonym of \\"Stonehenge\\" in the 1880s,Cook (1885): p. 72 and was denied by many breeders of that era.Cook (1885): p. 75 By the mid-1800s, the breed was known as the Dandie Dinmont Terrier, and became sought after for hunting after Scott's writings were published. They remain the only dog breed to have been named after a fictional character. Around this time the breed had some involvement in the development of the Bedlington Terrier. The Kennel Club formed in 1873 and, at the Fleece Hotel at Selkirk, Scottish Borders on 17 November 1875, the Dandie Dinmont Terrier Club (DDTC) was formed, becoming the third oldest breed club for dogs in the world. Lord Melgund was the society's first president, while E Bradshaw Smith was the first vice president. Breeders Hugh Dalziel and William Stachen were also involved in the formation of the club. The breed standard was created by William Wardlaw Reid, another founding member of the club, with it was agreed to a year later at another meeting of the club. A club show was held for the first time in Carlisle in 1877. Shows after this were held in conjunction with other clubs on a yearly basis until 1928 when it moved to the Market Hall in Carlisle, where with the exception of during the Second World War, the shows continued to be held until 1982. Shows continued to be held in the general area until 2001 when they moved south to Cheshire and Lancashire. The DDTC is not the only breed club in the UK. For a while several breed clubs were created in Scotland, but none lasted particularly long except for the Scottish Dandie Dinmont Terrier Society which merged into the DDTC in 1929. Today, in addition to the DDTC, there are also the Southern Dandie Dinmont Terrier Society, and for Scotland, the Caledonian Dandie Dinmont Club. A Dandie Dinmont Terrier and the more numerous West Highland White Terrier The breed was first registered with the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1888. The Dandie Dinmont Terrier was recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC) in 1918. During the Second World War many kennels were dispersed and the dogs destroyed, due to both the lack of food caused by rationing and that of manpower. Following the war several kennels led the way to re-establishing the breed including the Bellmead Kennels, located first in Surrey before later moving to Old Windsor. Dandies continued to be bred up at Bellmead up until the early 1990s, when it passed into the hands of Battersea Dogs and Cats Home. In 2006, the Kennel Club recognised the Dandie Dinmont Terrier as one of the rarest dog breeds native to the British Isles, putting it on a new list of Vulnerable Native Breeds. The breeds chosen for this list were those who originated in the UK and Ireland, but had less than 300 puppy registrations per year. One particularly low period was between July and September 2003, when only 21 puppies were registered, of which 18 were male. Overall that year, only 90 puppies were registered in the UK, compared to 9,823 for the West Highland White Terrier. Additionally numbers had dropped to low levels in America as well, with the AKC registering only 75 puppies in the same time period. Following work since 2006, the Dandie Dinmont registration numbers have improved slightly, with 151 puppies registered with the Kennel Club in 2010, the highest number for any year in the last ten years. Of other breeds of native terrier, only the Skye, Sealyham, Manchester and Glen of Imaal Terriers have lower registration figures.  Description  A pepper coloured Dandie (left), and a Mustard Dandie (right) The breed has short legs, with an elongated body. Unusually among Scottish terrier breeds, it has pendulous ears. The neck is muscular, having developed from the breed's use against larger game. The typical height at the withers is , and they can weigh anywhere between . While the Dandie generally is a hardy breed, it may have issue climbing stairs. They have a silky coat which forms a topknot on top of the dog's head. The Dandie Dinmont Terrier has a similar body shape to the Skye Terrier, but the Skye's coat is thicker and longer. The coat comes in two colour ranges, pepper and mustard. Pepper ranges from dark blueish black to very light silvery gray; mustard can vary from reddish brown to fawn, with the head appearing to be almost white. Typically, the legs and feet are of a darker colour with the lighter colour on the body slowly blending into that on the legs. The depth of the coat can reach up to . The colour of the coat is usually set by the time the dog reaches eight months of age, but the Dandie Dinmont Terrier will continue to mature physically until around two years old.  Temperament  The breed is tough but usually friendly and is suitable for older children. It makes both a good companion and a guard dog but is among the most docile of the terrier breeds; they are usually quite undemanding of their owners. However they are known for their ability to dig large holes in a short space of time. They can be trained to be good with cats but should not be trusted around smaller animals such as hamsters or rats. They are described as being \\"very game\\", in that they are prone to challenging other animals, including foxes, and in some cases other dogs.  Health  Due to the breed's elongated body, there can be back problems within the breed, specifically with intervertebral discs in the dog's back. These discs can sometimes slip out of place, resulting in spinal disc herniation. Symptoms depend on what part of the dog's back is affected; they can include paralysis with loss of bladder and bowel control in the worst cases. They are described as at higher risk for extra-hepatic congenital porto-systemic shunts. https://avmajournals.avma.org/doi/abs/10.2460/javma.2003.223.1636 As a concerted effort has been made to breed out genetic abnormalities, there are no especially common conditions affecting the Dandie Dinmont Terrier. However, minor problems affecting the breed can include hypothyroidism, primary closed angle glaucoma and Cushing's syndrome. In order to combat glaucoma in the breed, the breed clubs recommend that Dandies should have a procedure called a gonioscopy performed on them at regular intervals throughout their lives. The Dandie is also at slightly higher risk of canine cancer than average. The average life expectancy of a Dandie Dinmont Terrier is 11-13 years.

Governor Mark Schweiker far right in 2002 Schweiker had decided against a run for the governor's office in 2002 and was preparing to finish out his term when the September 11 terrorist attack occurred. Ridge resigned as governor on October 5, 2001, to join the Bush administration as Homeland Security Advisor. Schweiker, from the far right, watches as President George W. Bush signs the Brownfields Bill. Schweiker began preparing for the transition as acting governor on September 20, and was formally sworn in as Pennsylvania's 44th governor on the day of Ridge's resignation. By provision of the Pennsylvania Constitution, Robert Jubelirer, the President Pro Tempore of the State Senate, became lieutenant governor. This became a matter of some controversy as Jubelirer retained his leadership position and seat in the state senate. In the wake of the terrorist attacks, Schweiker moved to secure Pennsylvania's five nuclear reactors, created the Governor's Task Force on Security by executive order, and expanded the ranks of the Pennsylvania State Police. Schweiker also faced budget shortfalls due to the economic collapse following the attacks and a crisis in the School District of Philadelphia. Schweiker negotiated the state takeover of the school district and also was the first governor of Pennsylvania to put state funds into pre-school activities. He also passed the most significant tort reform measures in recent decades, when he replaced Ridge, a former trial lawyer less inclined to push those measures. Schweiker's most famous contribution as governor came in July 2002, during the Quecreek Mine rescue in Somerset County, when he personally oversaw the 77-hour operation that saved the lives of all nine trapped coal miners from the Quecreek mine. Following the rescue, Schweiker implemented a series of new safety procedures to provide better protection for miners. Schweiker held to his decision not to stand for the 2002 governor's race despite several polls that showed him with a comfortable lead in a hypothetical match-up with eventual Democratic nominee Ed Rendell. However, he did send out a news release as a joke on April Fools' Day announcing his intention to run. Rendell won the election and was sworn in as Schweiker's successor on January 21, 2003. Schweiker was named to the PoliticsPA list of \\"Sy Snyder's Power 50\\" list of influential individuals in Pennsylvania politics in 2003. After governorship Schweiker left office when his term expired on January 21, 2003. He became president and CEO of the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce in February 2003 and served until 2009 when he announced his resignation to join Philadelphia-area pharmaceutical manufacturer PRWT as president of business process outsourcing. Schweiker is also a consultant to the law firm of Stradley Ronon. His commitment to the Pennsylvania business community led him to his current position as the Chief Relationship Officer and SVP of the King of Prussia- based technology company Renmatix. Working closely with the company's technical team and board of directors, Schweiker has been instrumental in driving key initiatives with public and private sector stakeholders across several business areas including: site selection for production facilities, financial partnerships, feedstock procurement, commercial programs, and public affairs. He plays a critical cross-functional role in accelerating corporate development in the United States and abroad. Schweiker has been a vocal advocate of the United States' opportunity to take a leadership role in building a bio-economy, while revitalizing rural economies. A trusted voice in the industry, Schweiker is a frequent speaker, addressing opportunities the bio-economy and green manufacturing can have in developing robust, economies centered around agricultural communities. His career has earned him many honors and awards, including Life Sciences Public Official of the Year, Speaker of the Year for Communications Excellence and Technology Advocate of the Year for Technology Innovation. Schweiker has also presented to Congress a number of times and appeared as a guest on CNN, FOX Business, PBS's Charlie Rose Show and NBC's Tonight Show. He has spoken at: the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, the Atlantic's Town Hall Gathering and AgBiomass Canada.http://www.biomass.cloverpad.org/Conferencea In a 2016 article in The Huffington Post, Schweiker brought attention to the Indian government's renewed focus on bioethanol as a sustainable energy source for the country. He explained that, \\"As the country emerges as a pivotal actor in international energy discussions, India's bio-energy strategy will provide a blueprint for other countries with plentiful agricultural waste to leverage and spur economic growth.\\" In January 2016, Schweiker endorsed state representative Scott Petri for the 8th District of Pennsylvania for Congress.

He was nominated for the best original song Oscar nine times in eleven years, including five consecutive years between 1940 and 1944, and won the award once, for \\"You'll Never Know\\". That song has proved among his most enduring, and remains popular in films and television commercials to this day. \\"At Last\\" is another of his best-known songs. Biography Gordon was born in Warsaw, then part of the Russian Empire and moved to New York City as a child. He appeared as a vaudeville actor and singer in the late 1920s and early 1930s but his songwriting talents were always paramount. He formed a partnership with English pianist Harry Revel that lasted throughout the 1930s. In the 1940s he worked with a string of other composers including Harry Warren. The Internet Movie Database states that Gordon's songs have been used in the soundtrack of over 100 films, Gordon writing specifically for at least 50 of them. His catalogue includes more than 120 songs sung by some of the world's most famous and talented performers such as Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr., Etta James, Glenn Miller, Barbra Streisand, Mel Torm√©, Christina Aguilera and many more. His close friendship with many of his artists (such as Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack) and his ability to write lyrics that were timeless allowed him to become one of the most famous members of the world of music and a legendary lyricist. Thus there is perhaps no surprise that his exhibit in the Songwriters Hall of Fame says he is \\"arguably one of the most successful lyricists to write for the screen\\".

Co-founded with cellist Helen Liebmann, it toured extensively during the 1980s and 1990s. The band's sound is not easily categorized, having elements of exuberant folk music and a minimalist aesthetic occasionally reminiscent of composers such as Philip Glass. The group recorded and performed for 24 years until Jeffes died of an inoperable brain tumour in 1997. Several members of the original group reunited for three concerts in 2007. Since then, five original members have continued to play concerts of PCO's music, initially as The Anteaters, then as The Orchestra That Fell to Earth. In 2009, Jeffes' son Arthur founded a successor band simply called Penguin Cafe. Although it includes no original PCO members, the band features many PCO pieces in its live repertoire, and records and performs new music written by Arthur. History After becoming disillusioned with the rigid structures of classical music and the limitations of rock, in which he also dabbled, Simon Jeffes became interested in the relative freedom in ethnic music and decided to imbue his work with the same immediacy and spirit. Describing how the idea of the Penguin Cafe Orchestra came to him, Jeffes said: The group's debut album, Music from the Penguin Cafe, recorded from 1974 to 1976, was released in 1976 on Brian Eno's experimental Obscure Records label, an offshoot of the EG label. It was followed in 1981 by Penguin Cafe Orchestra, after which the band settled into a more regular release schedule. The band gave its first major concert on 10 October 1976, supporting Kraftwerk at The Roundhouse. They went on to tour the world and play at a variety of music festivals as well as residencies on the South Bank in London. From 1976 to 1996 they played in the US, Canada, Australia, Japan, and throughout Europe and the UK. In March 1987, they were the subject of an episode of the ITV arts series The South Bank Show, where they performed \\"Air\\", \\"Bean Fields\\", \\"Dirt\\" and \\"Giles Farnaby's Dream\\". Evolution Simon Jeffes experimented with various configurations live and in the studio, including an occasional 'dance orchestra' and a quintet of strings, oboe, trombone and himself on piano. On the studio albums, he sometimes played several instruments, and brought in other musicians according to the needs of each piece. There were a number of incarnations of the live band. Original members Gavyn Wright and Steve Nye left in 1984 and 1988 respectively. Bob Loveday replaced Gavyn Wright on violin. Gradually a regular lineup evolved around: * Jeffes and Helen Liebman * Neil Rennie (ukulele), who joined in 1975 * Geoffrey Richardson (viola, cuatro, guitar, clarinet, mandolin, ukulele), who had joined in 1976 and co- wrote three pieces on Broadcasting from Home (1984) * Julio Segovia (percussion), who answered an advert in Melody Maker and joined in 1978 on percussion * Paul Street (guitar, cuatro, ukulele), who joined in 1984 and left in 1988 * Jennifer Maidman (percussion, bass, ukulele, cuatro), who joined in 1984 * Steve Fletcher (piano, keyboards) who replaced Steve Nye in 1988 * Annie Whitehead (trombone), who had appeared on Broadcasting from Home (1984) and joined the live band in 1988 * Peter McGowan (violin), succeeding Bob Loveday * Barbara Bolte (oboe) Doug Beveridge also became a regular fixture at the live mixing desk. The album Concert Program (1995) is the definitive recording of this lineup, and includes many of the group's best- known pieces. Later bands After Jeffes' death in 1997, the band's members continued to meet occasionally, but there were no new recordings or public appearances for over ten years. The band briefly reformed in 2007, with the lineup as featured on Concert Program (minus Julio Segovia), with Jennifer Maidman now handling Simon's guitar parts. The original members, joined onstage by Simon Jeffes's son Arthur on percussion and additional keyboards, played three sold-out shows at the Union Chapel in London. After those concerts, Arthur Jeffes wanted to form a new group without any of the original PCO members. He called it \\"Music from the Penguin Cafe\\", later shortened to simply Penguin Cafe. The all-new ensemble, sometimes inaccurately billed as The Penguin Cafe Orchestra, played at a number of festivals in 2009, combining Penguin Cafe numbers with new pieces. In 2010 they appeared at the BBC Proms (with Northumbrian piper Kathryn Tickell). With the Penguin Cafe name now being used by Arthur, the original PCO members who wanted to continue playing their music needed an alternative name. Four of them, multiinstrumentalists Geoffrey Richardson and Jennifer Maidman, trombonist Annie Whitehead, and pianist Steve Fletcher, have since played some festivals as The Anteaters. They have been joined by percussionist Liam Genockey, well known as a member of Steeleye Span, and who played live with the Penguins in Italy in the 1980s. The name 'Anteaters' came from an incident on the 1983 PCO tour of Japan when Simon Jeffes discovered there was a craze for penguins in the country. He joked that, if the fashion changed, the orchestra would have to change its name to 'The Anteater Cafe Orchestra'. In October 2011, the same lineup appeared at the Canterbury Festival in Kent, UK, performing two hours of original PCO music as The Orchestra That Fell To Earth. They have continued to perform under that name. Notable pieces The Penguin Cafe Orchestra's most famous piece may be \\"Telephone and Rubber Band\\", which is based around a tape loop of a UK telephone ring tone intersected with an engaged tone, accompanied by the twanging of a rubber band. It is featured on the soundtracks of Nadia Tass's film comedy Malcolm (1986) and Oliver Stone's film Talk Radio (1988), and in a long-running advertising campaign for the telecoms company One2One (now T-Mobile). The 1996 single \\"In The Meantime\\" by New York City-based English rockers Spacehog featured a tweaked and fine-tuned sample of \\"Telephone and Rubber Band\\". It was also the trademark song of Caloi en su tinta, an Argentinean TV show about artistic animation. The tape loop was recorded when Jeffes was making a phone call and discovered he was hearing a combination of a ring tone and an engaged signal due to a fault in the system. He recorded it on an answering machine. Another famous tune featured in Malcolm (among other films) is \\"Music for a Found Harmonium\\", which Jeffes wrote on a harmonium he had found in a back street in Kyoto, where he was staying in the summer of 1982 after the ensemble's first tour of Japan. He wrote that after installing the found harmonium \\"in a friend's house in one of the most beautiful parts at the edge of the city,\\" he \\"frequently visited this instrument during the next few months, and I remember the time fondly as one during which I was under a form of enchantment with the place and the time.\\" \\"Music for a Found Harmonium\\" was used in the trailer for, and over the end credits of, the 1988 John Hughes movie She's Having a Baby. In the credits, many film actors and celebrities of the time invent their favourite name for an imagined child. (It was not included in the soundtrack released from the movie.) \\"Music for a Found Harmonium\\" gained exposure when it was released on the first Caf√© del Mar volume in 1994. Because its rhythm, tempo and simple structure made it suitable for adaptation as a reel, it was subsequently recorded by many Irish traditional musicians, including Patrick Street, De Dannan, Kevin Burke and Sharon Shannon. An Irish traditional version was used on the soundtrack of the film Hear My Song, made in Ireland in the early 1990s. In 2004, Patrick Street's cover of \\"Music for a Found Harmonium\\" was featured in the film Napoleon Dynamite, and the following year in the film It's All Gone Pete Tong. The Scottish folk rock band Rock Salt and Nails, from Shetland, also recorded a version of the song for their debut album Waves in 1993. Simon Jeffes composed music for the ballet Still Life at the Penguin Cafe, largely based on earlier compositions for the Penguin Cafe Orchestra. (Geoffrey Richardson co-wrote one of the pieces.Roche, Henry, Still Life at the Penguin Cafe: Arranged for Piano by Henry Roche, Edition Peters, 2002) The ballet was first performed by the Royal Ballet in 1988, and the music was released as an album under Jeffes' name. Another of the group's well-known pieces is \\"Perpetuum Mobile\\" from their 1987 album Signs of Life. It has been used in several films, television and radio programmes, including as the main theme of the Australian stop-motion animated film Mary and Max (2009), and in the television adaptation of The Handmaid's Tale. Swedish DJ Avicii sampled the main melody for his song \\"Fade into Darkness\\". Because it was written in the 15/8 time signature, the melody seems to end and repeat one beat sooner than expected, giving it the feel of a perpetual motion device. Another piece called \\"Numbers 1-4\\" was featured in a dance film shown on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood episode 1604, when Mr. McFeely brings the video in to show. The film featured dancers from Pittsburgh's Dance Alloy, who used fitness balls in the dance. A number of pieces including \\"Numbers 1-4\\", \\"Perpetuum Mobile\\" and \\"Music for A Found Harmonium\\" were included on the soundtrack of the Channel 4 documentary series Road Dreams. Uses by others Covers * \\"Music for a Found Harmonium\\" was covered as a reel by the group Patrick Street on their 1990 album Irish Times, and subsequently by other folk acts including Galician band Matto Congrio in 1993, the California Guitar Trio on their Echoes album (2008), and by Irish accordion player Sharon Shannon on her first album. The tune was also covered by the pan-celtic violin ensemble Celtic Fiddle Festival in 1993, at the time consisting of former Silly Wizard fiddler Johnny Cunningham, Bothy Band fiddler Kevin Burke, and Kornog fiddler Christian Lemaitre, on their self-titled debut album. * \\"Music for a Found Harmonium\\" was the basis for a mix by The Orb which appeared (along with both the original and the cover version by Patrick Street) on Penguin Cafe Orchestra's 1996 \\"best of\\" album, Preludes, Airs and Yodels, and subsequently on The Orb's own 2001 remix compilation \\"Auntie Aubrey's Excursions Beyond the Call of Duty - The Orb Remix Project, Volume 2\\". The title was given as \\"Pandaharmonium\\" on the former and \\"Music for a Found Harmonium (Pandaharmoniumorb mix)\\" on the latter. * Avicii samples a section of \\"Perpetuum Mobile\\" in his dance track \\"Fade into Darkness\\" (previously known as \\"Penguin\\"); the Leona Lewis/Avicii collaboration \\"Collide\\" also uses the same piano hook. * \\"Music for a Found Harmonium\\" was used as part of a tune set (\\"Guns\\") by Roving Crows on their Deliberate Distractions album (2013) * The main theme of \\"Music for a Found Harmonium\\" was used by Earl 16 on his 1997 track \\"Steppin' Out\\". * A string quartet arrangement of \\"Music for a Found Harmonium\\" was used in the Japanese TV series Quartet (2017). Film *Penguin Cafe Orchestra music featured on the 1986 Australian cult film Malcolm, written by David Parker and directed by Nadia Tass. The film won the 1986 Australian Film Institute Award for Best Film. The opening theme is \\"Music for a Found Harmonium\\", and during the film features \\"Paul's Dance\\", \\"Yodel 1\\", \\"Yodel 2\\" and \\"Telephone and Rubber Band\\". The closing theme is \\"The Ecstasy of Dancing Fleas\\". * The first trailer for the John Hughes movie She's Having a Baby consisted of edited-together, increasingly fast, dialogue-free clips from the movie with only this musical piece playing over them. *\\"Telephone and Rubber Band\\" was used in the final sequence and at the start of the closing credits of Talk Radio (1988), directed by Oliver Stone. *\\"Perpetuum Mobile\\" was used as the main theme for the documentary The Union: The Business Behind Getting High (2007), the animated Australian film Mary and Max (2009), the Swedish movie Slim Susie (2003) and the documentary Project Nim (2011). *\\"Music For a Found Harmonium\\" is featured in Napoleon Dynamite (2004), and the 2016 film The Founder.  Radio/podcasts  * This American Life, a popular show on public radio in the United States, has often used the band's \\"Perpetuum Mobile\\" to accompany its stories, and news programs on National Public Radio have at times used the ringtone from \\"Telephone and Rubber Band\\" as bumper music between pieces. * The Economist magazine has used \\"Perpetuum Mobile\\" in its weekly podcasts. * The Australian ABC Radio National weekly broadcast of The Music Show uses \\"Perpetuum Mobile\\" as its theme music. * \\"Scherzo and Trio\\" is the theme music for BBC Radio 4's Round Britain Quiz. * \\"Pythagoras's Trousers\\" was the theme music for CBC Radio's Basic Black.

In the battle, an army of c. 8, 000‚Äì12,000 commanded by Duke Charles defeated a mixed force of c. 5,000‚Äì8,000 consisting of an invading army of mercenaries in the king's employ and diverse but poorly co- ordinated supporting Swedish noblemen's forces commanded by King of both Sweden and the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth Sigismund III Vasa, who was acting to maintain and restore his personal union against anti-Catholic forces in Lutheran Sweden. The Swedish kings general Constantin fought at the western bridge. The battle was the beginning of the seven decades long Polish‚ÄìSwedish Wars, which eventually destroyed the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, at the time, arguably the largest nation state in Europe. Like the Thirty Years' War which also involved Sweden, under the surface, the dynastic struggles were rooted firmly in religious strife between Protestants and Roman Catholics during the ongoing European wars of religion. Sigismund was captured during the battle, but as the Polish-Lithuanian crowned head of state, allowed to return to the commonwealth. He had engendered the civil war by violating his pledge to not interfere in religious matters in Sweden, nor to further the Catholic cause in Sweden. Background When King John III of Sweden died in 1592, his son Sigismund inherited the throne, despite his Catholic upbringing and despite already being King of Poland-Lithuania. However, he was refused coronation unless he agreed to the conditions of a clerical convention in Uppsala, making Sweden decisively Protestant. The debate was resolved in 1594, and freedom of religion was proclaimed, although only Protestants could hold high offices. The Swedish nobility also sought greater freedom and privileges. They were not granted these, but in the absence of the king, who spent most of his time in Poland, Sweden was to be ruled jointly by the Privy Council and Sigismund's uncle, Duke Charles. At the Riksdag in S√∂derk√∂ping, summoned against the will of the king, Duke Charles was elected regent in the king's absence. This was protested by Sigismund and those nobles loyal to him (mostly found in Finland after the king's governor, Klaus Fleming, had put down a peasant uprising there). Duke Charles sought to end the conflict by military means, but gained little support within the Privy Council. The new Riksens st√§nder he summoned at Arboga in 1597 ‚Äì again despite the king's orders ‚Äì saw few participants, and only one from the Privy Council. Even so, he did not receive support for military action, but initiated it nonetheless. Parts of southern Sweden were taken. Several of the Privy Council members fled to Poland to convince Sigismund to take counteraction. During the summer of 1598, Sigismund's fleet took back Kalmar and continued northward. The force won a battle against the troops of Duke Charles at Stegeborg:pl:Bitwa pod Stegeborgiem but soon found itself encircled and retired to Link√∂ping. The support Sigismund had counted on from the Swedish people did materialize to some extent, splitting the Swedish armed forces in two hostile fractions. The battle St√•ngebro is an area around two old bridges over the river St√•ng√•n, Stora St√•ngebro and Lilla St√•ngebro. Today it is a central part of Link√∂ping, but in the 16th century the city did not extend east of the river. When the forces of Duke Charles approached from the east on the morning of 25 September, Sigismund's army charged out of the city and met them at these bridges. A thick fog was instrumental at hiding the troop movements from their respective enemies. Both armies included small sections of cavalry. The duke was the first to attack. He won a quick victory at Stora St√•ngebro and moved over his troops to Lilla St√•ngebro, where Sigismund's forces had reached the eastern shore and defended a good position. The duke's forces retired up a hill, where severe fighting followed. Sigismund's cavalry did not engage in this fight, which led to a certain victory for Duke Charles. At this point, Sigismund asked for a truce, which was accepted. According to propaganda from Duke Charles, his losses where light, only ca. 40 dead and slightly more than 200 wounded while King Sigismund lost 2,000 soldiers, many of them drowned in the river while they retreated. The St√•ngebro monument in Link√∂ping Aftermath In negotiations after the battle, Charles demanded that Sigismund to send home his troops and surrender the Privy Council members loyal to him, and that the king himself stay to attend the Riksens st√§nder. Sigismund chose to leave the country instead, sailing back to Poland, but surrendering the Privy Council members in question. Soon, only Kalmar was held by the king's people. When it fell on 12 May 1599, Duke Charles had control over the entire country. When he asked the Riksens st√§nder at Link√∂ping in 1600 for support as regent, it answered by proclaiming him king. He did not begin to use the title himself however, under the name Charles IX, until 1603. This Riksens st√§nder also appointed a court to judge those aristocrats who had fought with Sigismund in the battle. Eight were sentenced to death; five of the executions were carried out. This event, at the main square of Link√∂ping on 20 March 1600, is known as the Link√∂ping Bloodbath. With Sigismund's loss of the Swedish crown, the Polish‚ÄìSwedish union was dissolved. A deep conflict between Sweden and Poland emerged; the nations would clash many times during the Polish‚ÄìSwedish War, not to be resolved until the Great Northern War. Also, most remaining Catholic elements of Swedish society were wiped out, and Sweden became one of the foremost advocates of Protestantism, not least important during the Thirty Years' War. A nine-metre monument was erected in 1898 at the battleground, immediately east of the river and close to the St√•ngebro sports field.

The film, a crossover between A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th series, retroactively establishes them in a shared universe and pits iconic horror film antagonists Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees against each other. It is the last film in each series before their respective reboots, being the eighth in the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise and the eleventh in the Friday the 13th franchise. Freddy vs. Jason was released in the United States on August 15, 2003. It grossed over $116 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film in both the Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street series. The film marks Robert Englund's final cinematic appearance as Freddy Krueger. Plot Freddy Krueger, now powerless in Hell because the residents of Springwood have forgotten about him, uses what's left of his powers to bring Jason Voorhees back to life. Freddy then disguises himself as Jason's mother to manipulate him into killing Springwood teenagers to create fear and allow him to regain his strength. Meanwhile, Lori Campbell, who lives with her widowed father, has a sleepover with her friends Kia and Gibb. They are later joined by Trey, Gibb's boyfriend, and his friend Blake, whom Kia tries to get Lori to hook up with, much to Lori's disgust. Jason kills Trey that night, and the police suspect Freddy. After a nightmare, Blake awakens to find his father killed before Jason kills him. The police call it a murder‚Äìsuicide the following day, hoping to contain Freddy. Elsewhere, Lori's ex-boyfriend Will Rollins and his friend Mark Davis, who are patients at the Westin Hills Psychiatric Hospital, take Hypnocil to suppress their dreams because of their previous contact with Freddy. A news report prompts them to escape and return to Springwood to tell Lori about Freddy. That night, Lori and the others attend a rave in a cornfield. Freddy tries to kill Gibb in a nightmare, but Jason kills her and several other attendees in the real world; this makes Freddy realize that Jason's rampage will deny him victims. Linderman and Freeburg escape the rave with Will, Lori, and Kia. Lori and Will go to Mark's house, and find Freddy killing him. Deputy Stubbs approaches Lori and her friends, who realize Freddy's plan. Learning about the Hypnocil, they try to steal it from Westin Hills; Freddy possesses Freeburg, however, who disposes of the medicine. After electrocuting Stubbs, Jason is tranquilized by the possessed Freeburg and kills him before he falls asleep. The teens devise a plan to pull Freddy from the dream world into reality and force him to fight Jason, bringing the unconscious Jason to the now-abandoned Camp Crystal Lake. Freddy fights Jason in the dream world, where his dream powers show him that Jason is afraid of water because of his death by drowning. He uses water to make Jason powerless, but Lori goes to sleep and tries to save Jason. Freddy attacks her and reveals himself as her mother's killer. Jason awakens at Camp Crystal Lake and chases the teens into a cabin. Linderman is killed, and the cabin catches fire. Lori is awakened and pulls Freddy into the real world, where he is confronted by Jason. As Jason and Freddy fight, the remaining teens escape the cabin. Kia distracts Freddy until Jason kills her. On a dock, the two killers do devastating blows to each other, with Jason tearing Freddy's clawed arm off after Freddy cuts off Jason‚Äôs fingers and stabs his eyes. Lori and Will pour gasoline on the dock and set it afire; this makes propane tanks explode, throwing Freddy and Jason into the lake. Freddy climbs out and tries to kill Lori and Will, but is impaled by a wounded Jason with his own clawed arm and decapitated by Lori with Jason's machete. Jason and Freddy's headless body then fall into the lake, both seemingly dead. After throwing the machete into the lake, Lori and Will depart. A victorious Jason emerges from the water the next day, holding his machete and Freddy's severed head. Freddy suddenly winks as his ominous laughter is heard in the background, implying he is still alive.The story is continued in the comic Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash.

Professional wrestler √ìscar Guti√©rrez, better known by his ring name Rey Mysterio, was Englund's stunt double for a scene in Freddy's boiler room lair. New Line Cinema studio chief Robert Shaye, who produced every preceding Nightmare on Elm Street film, played the school principal (credited as L.E. Moko). Production Development Influenced by fan desire for a crossover film with a fight between Freddy and Jason, New Line and Paramount tried to make a Freddy vs. Jason movie in 1987 but could not agree on a story. When Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan failed at the box office, Sean Cunningham wanted to reacquire the rights to Friday the 13th and begin working with New Line Cinema on Freddy vs. Jason (New Line owned Nightmare on Elm Street). Paramount and New Line wanted the license to the other's character so they could control a crossover film. Negotiations on the project collapsed, and Paramount made Jason Takes Manhattan. After Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan was released in 1989, the rights reverted to Scuderi, Minasian, and Barsamianto (who sold them to New Line). Before Cunningham could begin to work on Freddy vs. Jason, Wes Craven returned to New Line to make New Nightmare. This put Freddy vs. Jason on hold, but allowed Cunningham to bring Jason back with Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday.Bracke, Peter, pp.218‚Äì219 The ninth installment \\"turned a healthy profit\\".Bracke, Peter, pg. 238 Cunningham's \\"frustration\\" with the delayed development of Freddy vs. Jason led him to create Jason X to keep the series alive. Based on Jason Takes Manhattans concept of taking Jason away from Crystal Lake, the tenth film put the titular character in space.Bracke, Peter, pp.242‚Äì243 The film lost its biggest supporter with the resignation of president of production Michael De Luca. Lack of support let the finished film sit for two years before it was released on April 26, 2002. It was the series' lowest-grossing film at the domestic box office, and had the largest budget of any of the films to date.Bracke, Peter, pp.263‚Äì264 New Line spent a reported $6 million on script development alone from several different writers. Cyrus Voris & Ethan Reiff were commissioned by De Luca alongside Lewis Abernathy & Sean S. Cunningham. Neither draft was well liked by the studio so Brannon Braga & Ronald D. Moore were hired to bring the project in a new direction. David J. Schow was given an offer to write the script because he just happened to walk by De Luca's office one day. David S. Goyer and James Dale Robinson both subsequently rewrote the Voris/Reiff draft. Rob Bottin, known for his make-up work on The Thing and Total Recall, was selected to direct the film in 1997. Mark Verheiden entered the project in the late '90s and proposed releasing the film with two different endings; one with Freddy winning and one with Jason winning. Peter Briggs, Jason X writer Todd Farmer and screenwriting duo Jonathan Aibel & Glenn Berger were all later brought in to write for the film. Newcomers Mark Swift & Damian Shannon were hired after delivering a pitch that De Luca was happy with. Goyer returned to the project once again in an effort to trim \\"every ounce of fat\\" from Swift & Shannon's 120 page script. According to Swift and Shannon, several endings were considered for the film; one involved Pinhead of the Hellraiser franchise, but New Line did not want to secure the rights for the character. Casting Jason New Line, thinking that Freddy vs. Jason needed a fresh start, chose a different actor to play Jason. Cunningham disagreed with their decision, believing that Kane Hodder was the best choice for the role.Bracke, Peter, pp. 280‚Äì286 Although Hodder received a script for Freddy vs. Jason and met with director Ronny Yu and New Line executives, Yu and Matthew Barry felt that the role should be recast to fit Yu's image of Jason. Hodder said that New Line did not give him a reason for the recasting; according to Yu, however, he wanted a taller, slower and more-deliberate Jason.Grove, David, p. 217 The role went to Ken Kirzinger, a Canadian stuntman who worked on Jason Takes Manhattan. Yu said that Kirzinger was hired because he was taller than Robert Englund, who played Freddy Krueger. Kirzinger is tall, compared to the Hodder, and Yu wanted a much taller actor than the Englund. Kirzinger believed that his experience on Part VIII (doubling for Hodder in two scenes) and his height helped him land the part. New Line did not cast Kirzinger until it saw him on film, and his first scene was Jason walking down Elm Street. Douglas Tait played Jason in a re-shot ending: Music Release Home media The film was released on VHS and DVD as part of New Line's Platinum Series on January 13, 2004. The DVD release contained a second disc of bonus content with audio commentary by Ronny Yu, Ken Kirzinger and Robert Englund; deleted and alternate scenes with commentary; Ill Ni√±o's music video for \\"How Can I Live\\"; trailers and TV ads, soundtrack promotion and behind-the-scenes featurettes. The film was released on October 4, 2005 on Universal Media Disc and September 8, 2009 on Blu-ray; the Blu-ray release had the same content as the Platinum Series DVD. Reception Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 41% based on 160 reviews and an average rating of 4.85/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Fans of the two horror franchises will enjoy this showdown. But for everyone else, it's the same old slice and dice.\\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 37 out of 100 based on 29 reviews, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\".

Ancient Towns Of Russia Coin Series Gdov (; ) is a town and the administrative center of Gdovsky District in Pskov Oblast, Russia, located on the river Gdovka, just from its outflow into Lake Peipus. Population: History It was first mentioned in the beginning of the 14th century, as an outpost guarding the city of Pskov. Between 1431 and 1434, Pskovians built a fortress there, the remains of which can still be seen. It was attacked on numerous occasions by Swedes and Poles (e.g., during the Russo‚ÄìSwedish War (1590‚Äì1595) and the Ingrian War), captured by Swedes in 1614, but was finally returned to Russia in 1617 according to the Treaty of Stolbovo. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, Gdov was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate).–£–∫–∞–∑ –æ–± —É—á—Ä–µ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –≥—É–±–µ—Ä–Ω–∏–π –∏ –æ —Ä–æ—Å–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–∏ –∫ –Ω–∏–º –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–æ–≤ Gdov was mentioned as one of the towns into which the governorate was divided. In 1780, Gdov was granted town status; its coat of arms was granted on May 28, 1781. Between 1874 and 1912, Gdov issued Zemstvo stamps. The first stamp, worth two kopecks, appeared on April 16, 1874. Stamp production ceased, however, with the coming of World War I. In 1919, Gdov was an area where important events of the Russian Civil War and the Estonian War of Independence were taking place. Originally, the area east of Lake Peipus was under control of the revolutionary government. On May 15, 1919, the detachment under command of Stanis≈Çaw Bu≈Çak-Ba≈Çachowicz (subordinate to General Aleksandr Rodzyanko) captured Gdov and the whole uyezd thus came under control by the White Army troops of Nikolai Yudenich. In November 1919, the Red Army recaptured Gdov. On August 1, 1927, the uyezds and governorates were abolished and Gdovsky District, with the administrative center in Gdov, was established as a part of Luga Okrug of Leningrad Oblast.Administrative-Territorial Structure of Pskov Oblast, pp. 11‚Äì13 It included parts of former Gdovsky Uyezd. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were also abolished and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. Between March 22, 1935 and September 19, 1940, Gdovsky District was a part of the restored Pskov Okrug of Leningrad Oblast, one of the okrugs abutting the state boundaries of the Soviet Union. Between July 19, 1941 and February 4, 1944, Gdov was occupied by German troops and Waffen SS units from occupied Estonia. During the war two-thirds of Gdov population died. The town was seriously damaged during the war, of 640 buildings that existed by 1941 all but 34 were destroyed. Most of the devastation was made just before the Nazi retreat, on January 28, 1944, when 37-th SS police battalion formed in Tartu set wooden buildings on fire and set explosives into those of stone. Among the perished historical constructions was the unique ensemble of two XV and XVI-century churches that has survived the Bolshevik anti-religion campaigns. On August 23, 1944, the district was transferred to newly established Pskov Oblast. The town was reconstructed during 1950-1960-ties and continued to expand until the economic and demographic collapse of early 1990-ties. In 1993 the exact copy of St. Dmitry Solounskiy church was built in its original location within Gdov kremlin, financed exclusively by crowdfunding. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Gdov serves as the administrative center of Gdovsky District, to which it is directly subordinated.Law #833-oz stipulates that the borders of the administrative districts are identical to the borders of the municipal districts. The Law #420-oz, which describes the borders and the composition of the municipal districts, lists the town of Gdov as a part of Gdovsky District. As a municipal division, the town of Gdov, together with sixty-two rural localities, is incorporated within Gdovsky Municipal District as Gdov Urban Settlement.Law #420-oz Economy Industry The economy of Gdov is based on food and timber industries. Transportation St. Dmitry Solounskiy cathedral in Gdov (1993) Gdov railway station A railway line via Gdov that connected Narva and Pskov was built before WWI. Later a new line from Gdov to Slantsy and Veimarn was constructed and used for passenger and cargo connections to Leningrad. During the WWII the Gdov-Pskov stretch was destroyed, thus making Gdov the terminal station. There was one pair of passenger trains daily servicing St.Petersburg-Gdov route. In the mid-2010-tiess tghe passenger traffic between Slantsy and Gdov has been discontinued due to commercial reasons. During 1950-1980-ties an unpaved airfield in Gdovhttps://maps.aopa.ru/#lon/27.829245/lat/58.735135/z/15/bl/gs/type/1/p/292/mode/r/ll/a was used for commuter air transit to the neighbouring town of Slantsy, Pskov and Tartu aboard An-2 passenger biplane. Gdov is connected by paved roads with Pskov, Kingisepp via Slantsy, and Plyussa. There are daily bus services to Pskov, Slantsy, Saint-Petersburg, and neighbouring villages. In the mouth of the Gdovka there is a harbour for the fishermen's and leisure boats. However, due to lack of customs and borderguard offices sailing to Estonia is not possible. Military installations During World War II Gdov briefly hosted the headquarters of the Chudskoye Lake Flotilla (1941). Russian Airforce base, Smuravyevo, now abandoned, was located northeast of the town. Restricted access Gdov is included into border security zone, intended to protect the borders of Russia from unwanted activity. Visits to the zone or transit through it are subject to the Frontier Regime Regulations set by the FSB that stipulate cases where permits are required or where holding a passport is enough. Permits may be obtained electronically via e-mail, four weeks ahead of the planned journey. Culture Carl Marx street, Gdov downtown The wall of the Gdov Kremlin Gdov contains two cultural heritage monuments of federal significance and additionally twelve objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local significance. The federal monuments are archaeological sites. Gdov has a kremlin, an ancient fortress built in the 14th century. Only fragments of the original fortress walls have survived. The St. Dimitry Solounskiy Cathedral was destroyed in 1944 and reconstructed in 1993. The only state museum in the district is the Gdov Museum of Regional History. It was founded in 1919, destroyed during the German occupation of Gdov, and re-created after World War II. The museum hosts historical and local interest collections.

Appearance According to the Kennel Club (UK), the English Toy Terrier (Black & Tan) should be in height and in weight. The only permitted color is black with defined tan markings on the legs, chest, and face. The movement is described as being like the extended trot of a horse. The English Toy Terrier (Black & Tan) has almond-shaped eyes and 'candle-flame' ears. History The English Toy Terrier (ETT) (Black & Tan) developed from the Old English Black and Tan Terrier and is closely related to the larger Manchester Terrier. Fast and agile, its origins are in the world of the rat pit, a sport popular in the cities of Victorian England where terriers were placed in a circle or pit with a number of rats and bets were taken as to which dog would kill its quota of rats in the fastest time. Small dogs were highly prized, with the ideal being to produce the smallest dog still capable of killing its quota of rats in as short a time as possible. In 1848 a Black and Tan Terrier named Tiny the Wonder, weighing just , is recorded to have killed 200 rats in less than an hour. An English Toy Terrier (Black & Tan) Puppy The outlawing of this sport coincided with the formation of the Kennel Club. With its elegant appearance, the Black and Tan Terrier moved into the conformation show ring. At the first all-breeds dog show, there was a very respectable entry of Black and Tan Terriers divided by weight. This weight division continued with two varieties of Black and Tan Terrier until the 1920s when they were split into two breeds, the larger Manchester Terrier and the smaller Black and Tan Terrier (Miniature). The name English Toy Terrier (Black & Tan) was adopted in 1962. Black and Tan Terriers of all sizes were exported to Canada and the US, founding a population which was largely isolated from the European one until very recently. In North America, the two sizes were also split into two breeds until 1958 when declining numbers of the Standard Manchester Terrier prompted the American Kennel Club to redefine them as a single breed with two varieties: Standard and Toy.

The Kennel Club (UK) has opened the stud book, allowing the North American Toy Manchester Terrier to be re-registered as the English Toy Terrier (Black & Tan), provided it is certified to be of the Toy variety and not of the Standard variety. Some owners in Great Britain are against this decision; others see it as a positive way to preserve the breed. Further reading * Wilson, Roy. (2008). English Toy Terrier: Black and Tan.

According to the , it has a population of people. Geography It is located at the coast of Sorsogon Bay, at the south of Luzon island, making it a suburb of neighboring Sorsogon City. Barangays Casiguran is politically subdivided into 25 barangays. Climate History Established in the year 1600, Casiguran was the first missionary parish of Sorsogon. When the Spaniards first set foot in this part of Luzon in the 1570s, Casiguran was considered as their center of Kabikolan. In 1583, the Franciscan missionaries took over the evangilization work started by the Augustinians. The name Casiguran is believed to come from the Bicol phrase kasi gurang, meaning, mostly old, pointing to the fact that it was the first parish and therefore to be considered to be populated by senior inhabitants. It is also believed that the town was named Casiguran because, during the Spanish times, all the young men and ladies were kept hidden and only old people can be seen in the town. The reason of the townspeople for this is that the young people are being abused by the Spaniards, thus, kept them in hiding. One day, Americans set foot in the soil of the town and asked for its name. The people did not understand their language. Thinking that the Americans were asking why there are no young people, the people answered, \\"kasi gurang\\" (because only old people live there). The Americans thought that \\"Kasi gurang\\" was the name of the town. They left repeating the words \\"kasi gurang\\" as not to forget them, until it came to be called as \\"Casiguran.\\" Demographics References External links * Casiguran Profile at PhilAtlas.com * [ Philippine Standard Geographic Code] * Philippine Census Information * Local Governance Performance Management System Municipalities of Sorsogon ","title":"Casiguran, Sorsogon"},{"id":"714353","text":"The war against Sigismund () was a war between Duke Charles, later King Charles IX and Sigismund, King of Sweden and Poland. Lasting from 1598 to 1599, it is also called War of Deposition against Sigismund, since the focus of the conflicts was the attempt to depose the latter from the throne of Sweden. The war eventually resulted in the deposition of Sigismund, with Duke Charles taking over the government and later also acceding to the throne. Background When Stephen B√°thory died in 1586, Sigismund Vasa, son of King John III and Catherine Jagiellonica, was elected king of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth in an attempt to continue the Polish‚ÄìSwedish alliance, the original purpose being to confront Ivan IV \\"the Terrible\\" of Russia. Sigismund had sworn to cede Estonia to the Commonwealth. When King John III died in 1592 his son Sigismund, King of Poland since 1587, acceded to the Swedish throne. Then conflicts arose. Duke Charles, the only living son of Gustav Vasa, did not approve the accession of Sigismund, his nephew and a Catholic, to the government of a realm that could just as well be his. After Sigismund had been crowned King of Sweden on February 19, 1594, he decided that no Parliaments (riksdagar) could be summoned without the King's consent. Despite this, Charles summoned a Parliament at S√∂derk√∂ping in autumn 1595, at which he managed to get his will through. The Duke was appointed Regent with \\"the advice of the Council\\", meaning that he was to govern Sweden together with the Privy Council during the King's absence from the Realm. Soon afterwards, the nobility of Finland, led by the Sigismund-appointed Governor, Klaus Fleming, rejected these decisions. They sympathised with the King and considered Charles a rebel. As a counterattack, Charles instigated a rebellion against Fleming, the Cudgel War, among the farmers in Ostrobothnia. Fleming managed to quell the revolt but died in April 1597. Roughly at the same time, a letter arrived from Sigismund's headquarters in Poland stating that he would not accept Charles as regent. The Duke then used a tactic which his father had employed, namely to resign from office. However, the response was not what Charles had been hoping for: the King accepted Charles's resignation and invested complete power in the Privy Council. Despite the difficult situation, Charles summoned another illegal Parliament the same year, this time in Arboga. Only one of the Privy Councillors showed up. The reason was that Charles's goal of deposing Sigismund had now been revealed, and the men understood that a serious revolt was brewing. When Duke Charles threatened the absent men with severe punishment some of them lost courage. Erik Gustavsson Stenbock, Arvid Gustavsson Stenbock, , and fled immediately to Sigismund. Thus, in 1597, civil war erupted, and Duke Charles was able to assume control over a large share of the powerful castles in the country, and in this manner achieved control over almost all the Realm. The problem was Finland, where Klaus Fleming's widow guarded √Öbo castle. But after psychological warfare, Charles and his followers managed to take the castle in Turku (). It is said that when the Duke entered the castle chapel he saw Klaus Fleming's body lying in a coffin. He is said to have said: \\"Hadst thou now been alive, thy head would not have been in great safety.\\" Then Fleming's widow Ebba Stenbock is said to have approached the Duke and responded: \\"If my late husband had been alive, Your Grace would never have entered herein.\\" When Sigismund found out about what had happened in Finland he lost his patience. The King could not accept Duke Charles's disrespectful actions. He decided to use force. The Sausage Campaign and the Fall of Kalmar In February 1598 Sigismund assembled an army consisting of merely 5,000 men, mostly Hungarian and German mercenaries. A larger army had been proposed, but had been dismissed since Sigismund expected Swedish forces to join him, and also did not want to come into conflict with them. The advisers and the King expected military support from Finland and Estonia (homes of the Swedish gentry formerly commanded by baron Klaus Fleming). They also wanted help from Denmark‚ÄìNorway and pro- Sigismund parts of Sweden. The diplomat Laski was dispatched, but Denmark did not show any interest. In May, Sigismund's men started to advance northwards. The army gathered in Marienburg (Malbork), where the Livonian Baltic German J√ºrgen Farensbach was appointed commander. The army was to be transported from Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk) to Sweden on Swedish ships, but the Swedish Estates declined. They refused to lend him ships as long as he stayed with a foreign army. There was widespread suspicion against Sigismund and his Catholic warriors. Thus the Estates promised to protect Duke Charles and the others who rebelled against the King. Since the Swedes refused to help with the transport, Sigismund had to buy and capture ships. When he had got hold of a hundred ships, the army was able to begin its journey to Sweden. Due to bad winds, the journey across the sea took a long time. Hence, a coordinated attack by the Finns and Sigismund's Polish soldiers could not be undertaken. The Finnish soldiers, commanded by Governor Arvid Eriksson (St√•larm), landed in Uppland one week ahead of Sigismund's landing. Duke Charles was on his way to Kalmar when the Finns invaded Uppland. He immediately rode towards Stockholm to defend the city. Meanwhile, three Protestant leaders, Nicolaus Olai Bothniensis, Laurentius Paulinus Gothus and , attempted to stop the Finnish Sigismund loyalists. They were able to get the support of the farmers of Uppland, and after some minor fighting, St√•larm's men withdrew. They felt threatened by Duke Charles's navy, and were ordered not to get involved in any major battles. This event has been somewhat peculiarly named \\"The Sausage Campaign\\", because the farmers captured the Finns‚Äô bags, containing sausages. The Sausage Campaign was a minor victory for Duke Charles. The greatest threat was coming from the south. At the end of May 1598 Sigismund landed on Swedish soil at Avask√§r. The King opened peacefully by sending the diplomat Samuel ≈Åaski to Kalmar for negotiations. His task was to convince the city's commanders to open the gates. However, the negotiations led nowhere. Instead, the King took his soldiers and marched on Kalmar. The army halted just outside the city. The plan was to frighten the commanders into opening the gates. To make his message even more terrifying, Sigismund threatened the city with severe punishments and to withdraw the nobility of all children in the city. The propaganda worked well and Sigismund was able to make his long-desired entry on August 1. Decisive events After the fall of Kalmar, Duke Charles found himself with major trouble on his hands. The Polish Crown army attracted Swedish followers and Stockholm, lacking military defence, was easily taken with the help of the nobility and officers of G√∂taland. After this event, the cavalry of Uppland joined up Sigismund, and new forces were mobilised in Finland and Estonia. A group of envoys from Brandenburg, Prussia and Mecklenburg shuttled back and forth between Duke Charles's and Sigismund's camps for three weeks, trying to rescue the peace. Despite their great efforts, they failed. Sigismund sailed with his infantry to Stegeborg Castle on August 11. The cavalry went to the same place by land. Charles's situation was hardly optimal. The only bright spots were the escapement of , the ex- commander of Stockholm, from the city, and the Swedish navy's refusal to join forces with the Poles. ≈Åaski took Stockholm Castle and Sigismund now had control over Stockholm, the key to Sweden. However, Sigismund and his fleet sailed into a violent storm: hundreds of men were thrown overboard and perished. This incident dramatically changed the situation. Suddenly, the King was in an exposed position. On August 22 he landed at Stegeborg with merely 100 men, a position worsened by the presence of Charles's rested army nearby. Sigismund's men had anyway taken the fortresses of √Ñlvsborg and Gullberg in other parts of the country. In the area around Stegeborg, Duke Charles had withdrawn to Link√∂ping, from where he could block the troop supply to Sigismund. The King was surrounded by in all 7,000 men, including the Swedes who joined him after landing. On August 28, Duke Charles and his men set out from Link√∂ping. They camped at Mem, a few kilometres northwest of Stegeborg. At the same time, negotiations between the parties were ongoing. The Duke requested clear-cut answers from Sigismund, which the King interpreted as indicating that an assault was impending. His own army was in a trap, but he counted on help from other forces elsewhere. Hans Vejer was ordered to attack the Swedes in the back, from the west; another commander, Farensbach, drew up his forces in order of battle in front of the enemy. Charles immediately responded. At the morning of September 8, the Swedes attacked Sigismund in the Battle of Stegeborg. The Swedes got off to a real nightmare start, and after a few hours, Sigismund's victory was clear. Being magnanimously, the King ordered the killing to stop, allowing Charles and his army to escape. The losing Swedes quickly withdrew to their camp at Mem Castle. The losses amounted to 300 men, but the loss of prestige hurt Charles the most. He felt himself extra humiliated by Sigismund's magnanimous behaviour. The strain grew so big that the normally stubborn Charles wanted to abdicate and escape the country with his family. A few senior officers managed to persuade Charles to stay, however. The negotiations were resumed and they led to a two-day ceasefire. During these days, there was plenty of maneuvering among the forces. Sigismund summoned more soldiers from Poland, at the same time as the Swedish navy sailed towards the coast. The King was in charge of the situation until the Swedish navy, commanded by Joachim Scheel, anchored outside Stegeborg. Because of unfavorable winds, they had not been able to do this before. But once they had got there, the tables turned again. Since Scheel brought with him new forces, Charles could raise the stakes in the negotiations. The navy also blocked any reinforcements to Sigismund from Poland. Sigismund immediately felt threatened and treated the blockade as a declaration of war. For this reason, he and the Poles left Stegeborg on September 20 to march on Link√∂ping. Duke Charles's army immediately followed. The night to September 25 minor detachments skirmished with each other. The morning of September 25, 1598 the armies clashed in a major engagement at the Battle of St√•ngebro. Charles offered talks again but attacked in a mist while Sigismund's men were withdrawing to their camp, which resulted in only the mercenaries fighting since his Swedes refused to fight. Duke Charles won a decisive victory which forced Sigismund to agree to harsh terms. Charles demanded that the King send home his entire army, but that he himself was to stay and await a Parliament. Also, a number of Swedes who had sided with Sigismund, including his Council supporters, were captured. These were later executed in the Link√∂ping Bloodbath of 1600. The agreement was sealed with a dinner between Charles and Sigismund on Link√∂ping Castle. The King, who was under pressure, fearing for his life without his army and having realised that he had lost the political battle, fled during the coming days to Poland in late 1598. At the same time as the peace treaty was being signed in Link√∂ping, conflicts were taking place in Dalarna. There, a pro-Sigismund bailiff, , had tried to raise up the Dalecarlians against Duke Charles. Chaos ensued. N√§f was executed, and the Dalecarlians set out on the so-called Neaf Campaign (1598), burning and killing down to Brunnb√§ck ferry. In V√§sterg√∂tland, Carl Carlsson Gyllenhielm, illegitimate son of Duke Charles, defeated the rebellion. Year 1599 The King had planned to return to Sweden, which raised morale among his followers. However, these plans were never put into action. But the war had not ended. It continued for a few months, as Charles tried to reclaim the cities that were still in Sigismund's hands. He started by appointing a new city government in Stockholm. Then he scolded the burghers, who he claimed hadn't defended the city enough. It all finished with a lot of people being jailed, among them Archbishop Abraham Angermannus, who had supported Sigismund. Then Swedish forces, led by Carl Carlsson Gyllenhielm, marched towards Kalmar to lay siege to the city. Johan Larsson Sparre defended the walls and the castle in the hope that the King would return to Sweden. But he never got any assistance and the night between March 1 and March 2 the city was assaulted. Gyllenhielm and Samuel Nilsson were ordered to attack the north gate. Duke Charles himself led the attack on the western gate. After a short and sharp fight, Charles's men managed to scale the walls. Since the soldiers began looting the city, however, the opportunity to capture Kalmar Castle in the same stroke was lost. The coming days, the castle proved more tenacious than expected. Johan Larsson Sparre kept the Swedes away, and finally six Polish ships arrived. These, however, were driven back by four smaller Swedish ships and Swedish artillery fire from within the city. When the Polish ships were unable to do anything, hope disappeared for the defenders inside the castle. On May 12, they surrendered. After that, Johan Larsson Sparre and his closest men, including Christoffer Andersson Str√•le and , were captured. After the assault and capture of Kalmar, the focus of the war moved to Finland. Stronghold after stronghold began to be captured in July. At first, Hans Klasson Bielkenstierna and Peder Stolpe commanded the battle against Sigismund's followers, but on August 19, Duke Charles personally assumed command. With the help of the navy, he crushed the last remnants, and by September all of Sigismund's followers were gone, detained or executed, e.g. in the √Öbo bloodbath. Aftermath and consequences Sigismund was officially deposed from the throne of Sweden by a Parliament, Riksdag, held in Stockholm on July 24, 1599. He was given six months to say whether he wanted to send his son. Prince Ladislaus of Poland, to Sweden as his successor, under the condition that the boy would be brought up in the Evangelical faith. Otherwise the Estates would look for a new king. In February 1600, Duke Charles summoned the Estates of the Realm to Link√∂ping. Since Sigismund had not provided a reply, the Estates elected Duke Charles as King Charles IX of Sweden. The consequences for those who had supported Sigismund were devastating. The most prominent among them were killed by the new King, in what was called the \\"Link√∂ping Bloodbath\\". During the winter and spring of 1600, Charles also occupied the Swedish part of Estonia, as the castle commanders had shown sympathies towards Sigismund. Charles' invasion of Livonia led to a series of wars with Poland, starting with the Second Polish‚ÄìSwedish War. Charles accepted the crown as Charles IX in 1604.

It was directed by Franc Roddam in his feature directing d√©but. Unlike the adaptation of Tommy, Quadrophenia is not a musical film, and the band does not appear live in the film. The film stars Phil Daniels as Jimmy, a young 1960s London-based Mod who escapes from his dead-end job as a mailroom boy by dancing, partying, taking amphetamines, riding his scooter and brawling with the motorcycle-riding Rockers. After he and his friends participate in a huge brawl with the Rockers at the seaside town of Brighton, he is arrested and his life starts to spiral out of control; he loses his love interest (Leslie Ash), gets kicked out of his house by his parents, and discovers that his idol, the popular mod nicknamed \\"Ace Face\\" (Sting), is actually a bell boy at a hotel. Plot In 1964, Jimmy Cooper (Phil Daniels) is a young London Mod, disillusioned by his parents and a dull job as a post room boy in an advertising firm. Jimmy finds an outlet for his teenage angst by taking amphetamines, partying, riding scooters and brawling with Rockers, accompanied by his Mod friends Dave (Mark Wingett), Chalky (Philip Davis) and Spider (Gary Shail). One of the rival Rockers is Jimmy's childhood friend Kevin (Ray Winstone). An attack by hostile Rockers on Spider leads to a retaliatory attack on Kevin. Jimmy initially participates in the beating, but when he realises the victim is Kevin, he berates the other attackers but does not stop them, instead riding away on his scooter revving his engine loudly in frustration. A planned bank holiday weekend away provides the excuse for the rivalry between Mods and Rockers to escalate, as both groups descend upon the seaside town of Brighton. Jimmy plans to be noticed as a 'face', and hints to Steph (Leslie Ash) ‚Äì a girl on whom he has a crush ‚Äì that he would like her to ride with him, but she confirms plans to ride with Pete (Garry Cooper), an older, well-heeled Mod instead. In preparation for the weekend, the pals try to buy some recreational drugs from a London gangster, Harry North (John Bindon), but are cheated with fake pills. After vandalising the drug-seller's car in retaliation, in desperation, they rob a pharmacy, finding a large quantity of their favourite 'blues'. Brighton seafront where the pals gathered after travelling from London After an early morning group ride from London to the south coast, the friends gather on the seafront, where Jimmy first sees a flamboyant scooter-riding Mod he describes as Ace Face (Sting). Later in a dance hall, Jimmy suggests that he will help Steph, whose escort is now chatting to an attractive American girl, to dance with Ace Face, but on the dance floor ushers her away to dance with himself. Steph leaves Jimmy to dance with Ace Face, whereupon Jimmy plots to gain attention by climbing up on to the balcony-edge and dancing with much applause, to the annoyance of Ace Face. After diving into the audience, Jimmy is ejected by bouncers. Steph's escort leaves with the American girl, and once again Jimmy tries to get with Steph, this time for the night, but she has arranged accommodation with a female friend. The lads spend the night sleeping rough, meet up at a cafe on the following morning, then proceed along the promenade, where a series of running battles ensue. As the police close in on the rioters, Jimmy escapes down an alleyway with Steph, and they have sex. When the pair emerge, they find themselves in the middle of the melee just as police are detaining rioters. Jimmy is arrested and detained with the volatile Ace Face. When fined ¬£75, a vast amount at the time, Ace Face mocks the magistrate (John Phillips) by offering to pay on the spot with a cheque, to the fellow Mods' amusement. Back in London, Jimmy becomes severely depressed. His mother throws him out after finding his stash of amphetamine pills. He then quits his job, spends his severance package on more pills, and learns that Steph is now his friend Dave's girlfriend. After a brief fight with Dave, the following morning his rejection is confirmed by Steph, and his beloved Lambretta scooter is accidentally destroyed in a crash. Jimmy takes a train back to Brighton, taking increasing levels of pills and becoming more emotionally unstable. In an attempt to relive the recent excitement, he revisits the scenes of the riots and his encounter with Steph. To his horror, Jimmy discovers that his idol, Ace Face, has a menial job as a bellboy at the Grand Brighton Hotel. Jimmy steals Ace's scooter and heads out to Beachy Head, riding close to the cliff-edge. Finally, the scooter is seen crashing over the cliff-top, which is where the film begins with Jimmy walking back against a sunset backdrop.

The distributors of the film refused to insure him for the part and he was replaced by Phil Daniels. Most of the cast were reunited after 28 years at Earls Court on 1 and 2 September 2007 as part of The Quadrophenia Reunion at the London Film & Comic Con run by Quadcon.co.uk. Subsequently, the cast agreed to be part of a Quadrophenia Convention at Brighton in 2009. Soundtrack Quadrophenia is the soundtrack album to the 1979 film of the same name, which refers to the 1973 rock opera Quadrophenia. It was initially released on Polydor Records in 1979 as a cassette and LP and was re-released as a compact disc in 1993 and 2001. The album was dedicated to Peter Meaden, a prominent Mod and first manager of The Who, who had died a year prior to the album's release. The album contains ten of the seventeen tracks from the original rock opera Quadrophenia (as not all of the tracks were used in the film). These are different mixes than those that appear on the 1973 album as they were remixed in 1979 by John Entwistle. The most notable difference is the track \\"The Real Me\\" (used for the title sequence of the film) which features a different bass track, more prominent vocals and a more definite ending. Most of the tracks are also edited to be slightly shorter. The soundtrack also includes three tracks by The Who that did not appear on the 1973 album. Production Alley between East Street and Little East Street, Brighton, England, made famous as the location where Jimmy Cooper and Steph have sex in Quadrophenia. The small yard is to the right of the \\"Chris from Margate\\" graffiti, a spot often visited and left with graffiti to mark that visit. Turning left will take you to East Street. Several references to The Who appear throughout the film, including an anachronistic inclusion of a repackaged Who album that was not available at the time, a clip of the band performing \\"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\\" on the TV series Ready Steady Go!, pictures of the band and a \\"Maximum R&B;\\" poster in Jimmy's bedroom, and the inclusion of \\"My Generation\\" during a party gatecrashing scene. The film was almost cancelled when Keith Moon, the drummer for The Who, died, but in the words of Roddam, the producers, Roy Baird and Bill Curbishley, \\"held it together\\" and the film was made. Only one scene in the film was shot in the studio; all others were on location. Beachy Head, where Jimmy considers suicide at the end of the film, was the location of a real- life suicide that supposedly influenced the film's ending. The stunt coordinators underestimated the distance that the scooter would fly through the air after being driven off Beachy Head. Franc Roddam, who shot the scene from a helicopter, was almost hit. Jeff Dexter, a club dancer and disc jockey fixture in the Sixties London music scene was the DJ in the club scenes, and was the uncredited choreographer of 500 extras for the ballroom and club scenes. He also choreographed Sting's feet in his dance close-ups. Dexter managed America whose first major gig at \\"Implosion\\" at The Roundhouse, Chalk Farm, was the opening act to The Who on 20 December 1970. Reception Janet Maslin, reviewing the film for The New York Times in 1979, called it \\"...gritty and ragged and sometimes quite beautiful\\", creating a \\"...slice-of- life movie that feels tremendously authentic in its sentiments as well as its details.\\" Maslin states that the director's scenes of youth battles \\"...capture a fierce, dizzying excitement that epitomizes a kind of youthful extreme.\\" Reviewer Brian Gibson from Vue Weekly (Edmonton, Canada) stated that \\"Roddam's look back at an angsty young man in '65 is a throwback to the kitchen-sink dramas that began plumbing the depths of working class lives then. Reeking with a restless teen spirit, Quadrophenia leads us down adolescence's blind alleys of rebellion.\\" Critic Matt Brunson from Creative Loafing stated that the film \\"[m]anages to be both quintessentially British and irrefutably universal\\", giving it a 3.5/4 score. Reviewer Eric Melin from Scene-Stealers.com states that the film has a \\"...gritty, realistic feel and the themes of youthful rebellion and confusion are absolutely timeless, magnified by the specificity of the setting rather than being limited by it\\"; he also gave the movie a 3.5/4 score. Reviewer Christopher Long from Movie Metropolis commented that \\"[w]hen you're an angry young man [like the main character], there's no better way to prove you're an individual than to dress and act exactly like everybody else\\"; Long gave the film a 6/10 score. Dennis Schwartz from Ozus' World Movie Reviews stated that the \\"...film lives through the superb raw angst-ridden performance of [lead] Phil Daniels\\"; Schwartz gave the movie a B+. Critic Cole Smithey from ColeSmithey.com called the film a \\"...glorious representational story of male teen angst that transcends its British locations and great music with a sense of the confused romantic notions that young men the world over carry with them\\"; Smithey gave the film an A+. Reviewer Ken Hanke from the Mountain Xpress (Asheville, NC) called it a \\"[d]isappointing film version of a great concept album\\"; he gave the film a 3/5 score. Film critic Jeffrey M. Anderson from Combustible Celluloid states that where the film \\"...succeeds[, it does so] through its devil-may-care attitude and energy\\"; on the other hand, Anderson states that the film \\"...feels like a low-budget homemade movie from the period.\\" Rotten Tomatoes collected reviews from 11 critics and gave Quadrophenia a 100% rating. The New York Times placed the film on its Best 1000 Movies Ever list.The Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made. The New York Times via Internet Archive. Published April 29, 2003. Retrieved June 12, 2008. Home media Universal Pictures Home Entertainment first released the film on DVD in 1999 with an 8-minute montage featurette. It used the VHS print, resulting in a much lower-quality video than expected. Following this in the US was a special edition by Rhino, which included a remastered matted wide screen transfer, a commentary, several interviews, galleries, and a quiz. However, it was a shorter cut of the film, with several minutes of footage missing. Rhino Home Video released the film on DVD on 25 September 2001. On 7 August 2006, Universal improved upon their original DVD with a Region 2 two-disc special edition. The film was digitally remastered and included a new commentary by Franc Roddam, Phil Daniels and Leslie Ash. Disc 2 features an hour-long documentary and a featurette with Roddam discussing the locations. Unlike their previous DVD, it was the complete, longer version, and it was matted to the correct aspect ratio. The Criterion Collection released a special edition version of this movie on 28 August 2012, on both DVD and Blu-ray formats.  Sequel  An unofficial sequel of sorts, To Be Someone, directed by Ray Burdis, stars some of the original cast, including Toyah Wilcox, Gary Shail and Phil Daniels. This film was however based on the book sequel, which itself was based on the rock opera. The film, like the book, changes some aspects of the story; though it keeps the main characters of Jimmy and Dave, it focusses on a later mod revival era, rather than the original 1960s mod era.

Early life Henry was probably born in Dublin, Ireland. a younger son of Henry Hamilton, an Irish Member of Parliament, and his wife. Hamilton was raised in County Cork, Ireland. His older brother Sackville Hamilton later served as a Privy Councillor and Under-Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. His direct paternal Great-great grandfather was Claud Hamilton, 1st Lord Paisley. Military career As was typical of younger sons, Henry Hamilton entered the military. During the French and Indian War in North America, part of the Seven Years' War between Britain and France, he served as a Captain in the 15th Regiment of Foot. They fought in the 1758 attack on Louisbourg and the Battle of Quebec. With the support of Governor General of British North America Guy Carleton, Hamilton rose to the rank of brigade major. In 1775, he sold his commission, leaving the British Army for a political career. American Revolutionary War Lieutenant Governor and Superintendent of Indian Affairs at Fort Detroit In 1775, Henry Hamilton was appointed as Lieutenant Governor and Superintendent of Indian Affairs at Fort Detroit, Province of Quebec (it then extended from the Atlantic to this area), British North America. (The fort site is now within the borders of Detroit, Michigan). This was one of five newly created lieutenant governorships in the recently expanded eastern territory of Canada. When Governor Hamilton reached his base at Fort Detroit to assume his government duties in the Great Lakes region, the American Revolutionary War was already underway. Hamilton was in a difficult position: as a civil official, he had few British regular troops at his command, and the natives of the region‚ÄîFrench Canadians and American Indians‚Äîwere not all supporters of the British regime. Normand Macleod, a local fur trader and army officer, acted as the temporary \\"town major\\", a British government official in command of a fortified town, before Hamilton's arrival.Macleod, Normand. Detroit to Fort Sackville, 1778‚Äì1779, Detroit: Burton Historical Collection, Detroit Public Library, 1778, pp. x‚Äìxiii British war policies on the western frontier Governor Henry Hamilton became adept at diplomacy with Native Americans, establishing good relations with local Indian leaders of the Huron and Ottawa tribes. An amateur artist, Hamilton also sketched portraits of many Native Americans while in Detroit, leaving what has been called the \\"earliest and largest collection of life portraits of Native Americans of the Upper Great Lakes.\\" This is now held by Houghton Library at Harvard University. At the beginning of the war, British policy encouraged neutrality among the Native American leaders. But in 1777 Hamilton received instructions to encourage Indian raid and massacre against the American frontier settlements in Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Kentucky. This was a controversial policy, because he and other officials realized that Loyalist civilian colonists would inevitably be killed in these raids, increasing resistance to the British. Hamilton tried to limit civilian casualties by sending British Army officers and French-Canadian militia with the Native American war parties. Despite this the Indian tribal warriors carried out their own customs during the raids, resulting in hundreds of women and children in Kentucky and western Pennsylvania being killed and ritually scalped during the war. This, as feared, led to an increase in anti-British feeling in the land. According to an early 20th-century local history, the frontier Americans believed that Hamilton paid bounties for prisoners and scalps brought in by the Indian warriors and hated him, calling him the \\"Hair-buyer General\\". Hamilton denied ever paying for scalps. Hamilton Surrenders to Clark George Rogers Clark and Illinois Regiment, Virginia state forces in the Illinois Country In 1778, Patriot Colonel George Rogers Clark, commanding Virginia state forces, captured several undermanned British posts in the Illinois Country, including Fort SackvilleFort Sackville was named in honor of George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville. at Vincennes (then in Virginia-claimed land, now in present-day Indiana). Hamilton led an armed party from Detroit on 7 October 1778Skaggs, 182 to recapture the British post, 600 miles away. His small force gathered Indian warriors along the way, and entered Vincennes on 17 December 1778. They captured Fort Sackville and the American commandant, Captain Leonard Helm.Skaggs, 183 In February 1779, however, Colonel Clark returned to Vincennes in a surprise march, recapturing the outpost and taking Hamilton prisoner. Defeat and prisoner in Virginia General George Rogers Clark sent Hamilton to the Virginia state capital in Williamsburg, where he was jailed and placed in irons by order of Governor Thomas Jefferson and the Virginia Executive Council. Hamilton was held from 16 June ‚Äì September 29, 1779. Hamilton rejected an offer of parole on the grounds that the terms violated his freedom of speech, in restraining him from \\"saying anything to the prejudice of the United States.\\" Jefferson refused to treat Hamilton and other British prisoners as prisoners-of-war and handled them as would have handled escaped slaves; putting them in irons for 18 months in Williamsburg and Chesterfield. Governor Jefferson did not release Hamilton until October 1780, and only after George Washington during several months had entreated him to accept his parole. Hamilton was sent to New York to await a prisoner exchange. This took place in March 1781. He immediately sailed to London, England on a British ship. Later career as British royal governor After the war, Henry Hamilton was reassigned to Canada in 1782 under an appointment as Lieutenant-Governor, and later Deputy-Governor of the Province of Quebec. He administered during the transition in the postwar years as the Crown granted thousands of acres of land, mostly in what became Upper Canada, to Loyalists as compensation for their losses in the former Thirteen Colonies and as payment to soldiers. After a few years, Hamilton was reassigned as royal Governor of Bermuda, serving from 1785 to 1794. He then departed Bermuda on HMS Scorpion (stopping enroute at Antigua on 4 December, 1794)to serve as Governor of Dominica, the present-day Commonwealth of Dominica, from 1794 until his death in office in 1796. In March 1795, at age 61, Hamilton married 25-year-old Elizabeth Lee from Banbury, Oxfordshire, a daughter of Colonel Lee. The Hamiltons had one daughter together, Mary Anne Pierpoint Hamilton. She died in 1871, unmarried and without children. Death Hamilton died in office on the island of Antigua, British North America, now Antigua and Barbuda, on 29 September 1796. Among his papers, Hamilton had kept a journal from 1778-1779 as Lieutenant Governor at Fort Detroit during the American Revolution; this was published for the first time posthumously in 1951 in a history that addressed his and George Rogers Clark's roles in the war.Barnhart, John D. Henry Hamilton and George Rogers Clark in the American Revolution, with the Unpublished Journal of Lieut. Governor Henry Hamilton. Crawfordville, Indiana: Banta, 1951 In popular culture US author Winston Churchill wrote an epic historical novel in 1904 called The Crossing covering a man's life in the old Northwest from the Revolution to the Burr Conspiracy. The first part is about the protagonist marching as a drummer boy with George Rogers Clark and the highlight is the capture of Vincennes from Hamilton. There is much information about Hamilton's activities and his reputation among the local backwoodsmen, based on research from original documents.

India In India, State funerals were initially reserved only for current and former Presidents, Prime Ministers, Union ministers and State Chief Ministers. And the decision to accord a state funeral rested initially with the union government. But laws have been changed such that the state government can now decide who will be given a state funeral, depending on the stature of the deceased. If the union government has decided for a state funeral then following procedures will be applied to all over India, else if the state government has declared a state funeral then it applies only to the state. The government takes into consideration the contribution made by the person to the state in various fields like politics, literature, law, science and arts. The chief minister of the concerned state takes a decision after consultations with other cabinet ministers. Once a decision is taken on the issue, it is conveyed to senior police officials including the deputy commissioner, the police commissioner and the superintendent of police, who have to make all the arrangements for a state funeral. During a State funeral, * A state mourning or National day of mourning is officially declared. * The national flag is flown at half mast as per the Flag Code of India. This decision solely lies with the President of India, who also decides the period for which flag is to be flown at half mast. * A public holiday is declared. * The deceased person's bier or coffin is draped with the national flag with saffron towards the head of the bier or coffin while lying in state. The flag should not be lowered into the grave or burnt in the pyre. * He/She is honored with a gun salute when being buried or cremated.

In Italy state funerals are granted by law to the Presidents of the constitutional entities, such as the Presidency, the Parliament, the Government and the Constitutional Court, even after their terms have expired, and to Ministers who died during their term in office. State Funerals can also be granted, by decree of the Council of Ministers, to people who gave particular services to the country; to citizens that brought honor to the nation; or to citizens who died in the line of duty, or were victims of either terrorism, or organized crime. The official protocol provides for * the coffin surrounded by six members in high uniform of either the Carabinieri or the same Armed Force the departed belonged to; * an honor guard to the coffin at the entrance and the exit of the place in which the ceremony is held; * the presence of one representative of the Government; * an official commemorative oration; * other honors that can be arranged by the Prime Minister.

The flags are flown at half-mast outside of public buildings, while inside they display two black ribbons, with the exceptions provided for military flags, when required by military protocol. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs gives instructions to the Italian embassies and consulates around the world, and can ask the foreign embassies and consulates in Italy to fly their flags at half-mast. If the departed held a public office, the body can lie in state in the building of the office's institution. In other cases it is followed the will of the family, the traditions of the office or the local customs. The family of the departed chooses the place in which the funeral will take place, in consultations with the Government's Department of State Ceremonies. Outside of the cases provided for by the protocol, for example during natural events that deeply impact the community, solemn funerals can be arranged and the six people who carry the coffins are members of the Civil Protection.

North Macedonia Since proclaiming independence in 1991, by law the presidents and prime ministers are entitled to a funeral with state honors, but by a decision of government its possible for other senior officials and distinguished persons with great merit for the state to be buried with state honors. The largest state funeral was held in 2004 for President Boris Trajkovski and the funeral was attended by 47 foreign delegations. Among others that are buried with state honors, are the first prime minister of independent Macedonia Nikola Kljusev and the famous singer To≈°e Proeski. Poland Poland held a state funeral for President of Poland Lech Kaczy≈Ñski and his wife, Maria Kaczy≈Ñska, on April 18, 2010, after he and 95 others perished in a plane crash. Russia In Russia, during the time of the Soviet Union (1917-1991), the state funerals of the most senior political and military leaders were staged as massive events with millions of mourners all over the USSR. The ceremonies held after the deaths as Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko all followed the same basic outline. They took place in Moscow, began with a public lying in state of the deceased in the House of the Unions and ended with an interment at the Red Square. The most notable examples of such state funerals during the Soviet period of Russian history are the ceremonies that were held for Lenin and Stalin, and for the death and funeral of Leonid Brezhnev. The House of the Unions in Moscow In the second half of the 20th century, whenever a General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union died, the event would first be officially acknowledged by Soviet radio and television. After several days of national mourning, the deceased would be given a state funeral and then buried. Soviet state funerals were often attended by foreign heads of state, heads of government, foreign ministers and other dignitaries from abroad. Following the death of General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev in 1982, there were five days of national mourning. Following the death of General Secretary Yuri Andropov in 1984, a four-day period of nationwide mourning was announced. The state funeral for a deceased General Secretary would be arranged, managed and prepared by a special committee of the Communist Party that would be formed for the occasion. As the funeral committee would normally be chaired by the deceased's successor, the preparations for Soviet state funerals were usually followed with great interest by foreign political scientists trying to gauge power shuffles within the Communist Party. The allocation of responsibilities during the funeral, appointment of pallbearers and positions within the order of precedence observed during the televised funeral ceremonies in Moscow could often be interpreted as a clue for the future position of Politburo members within the Party. When, after Brezhnev's death in 1982, Yuri Andropov was elected chairman of the committee in charge of Brezhnev's funeral, this was seen as a first sign by First World commentators that Andropov might be the most likely candidate for the position of General Secretary. Prior to interment, the body of the deceased General Secretary would lie in state in the Pillar Hall of the House of the Unions which was decorated by numerous red flags and other communist symbols. The mourners, which usually would be brought in by the thousands, shuffled up a marble staircase beneath chandeliers draped in black gauze. On the stage at the left side of the Pillar Hall, amid a veritable garden of flowers, a full orchestra in black tailcoats would play classical music. The deceased's embalmed body, dressed in a black suit, white shirt and a tie, would be displayed in an open coffin on a catafalque banked with carnations, red roses and tulips, facing the long queue of mourners. A small guard of honour would be in attendance in the background. At the right side of the hall there would be placed seats for guests of honour, with the front row reserved for the dead leader's family. On the day of the funeral, final ceremonies would be held at the Pillar Hall during which the lid of the coffin would be temporarily closed. The coffin would then be carried out of the House of the Unions and placed on a gun carriage drawn by a military vehicle. A funeral parade would then convey the coffin from the House of the Unions to the Red Square. Two officers led the funeral parade, carrying a large portrait of the deceased, followed by a group of numerous soldiers carrying red floral wreaths. A group of general officers would come next, carrying the late leader's decorations and medals on small red cushions. Behind them, the coffin rested atop a gun carriage. Walking immediately behind were the members of the deceased's family. The Politburo leaders, wearing red armbands, came next and led the last group of official mourners. At Brezhnev's funeral, the escort of official mourners included forty-four persons. As the coffin reached the middle of the Red Square, it would be removed from the carriage and placed on a red-draped bier facing the Lenin Mausoleum, with its lid removed. After a series of funeral speeches, which were delivered by military and political leaders (typically including the deceased's successor as General Secretary, as well as 'ordinary' workers) from the balcony of the Lenin Mausoleum, the coffin would be carried in a procession around the mausoleum to the Kremlin Wall Necropolis just behind it. There, with the most senior mourners looking on, the coffin would be placed on a red-draped bier and the mourners would pay last respects. The coffin's lid would then be closed for the final time and the body lowered into the ground by two men, with handfuls of earth thrown onto the coffin by the senior mourners. The grave would be filled in immediately afterward, while the mourners were still present to watch. Gun salutes would be fired, sirens sounded around the Kremlin and the Soviet national anthem be played. This marked the end of the interment. The senior mourners would then return to the balcony of the Lenin Mausoleum to review a parade on Red Square while the military band would play quick marches. This concluded the state funeral. With small deviations, the described protocol was roughly the same for the state funerals of Lenin, Stalin, Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko. Lenin and Stalin were placed inside the Lenin Mausoleum while the others were interred in individual graves in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis located behind the mausoleum along the actual Kremlin wall. Stalin's body would lie beside Lenin's in the mausoleum until being moved to the Kremlin Wall Necropolis several years after his death. In April 2007, Russian Federation's first President Boris Yeltsin was buried in state funeral after church ceremony at Novodevichy Cemetery. He was the first Russian leader and head of state in 113 years to be buried in a church ceremony, after Emperor Alexander III of Russia. Slovakia A state funeral was held for the former President Michal Kov√°ƒç in 2016. Switzerland The funeral procession of Henri Guisan in Lausanne (1960). In 1960, the funeral procession of Henri Guisan gathered more than 120'000 people in Lausanne. Gilles Simond, \\"Le 13 avril 1960, le peuple suisse, √©mu, a dit adieu √† son g√©n√©ral\\", 24 heures, 13 April 2016 (page visited on 17 May 2018) United Kingdom A state or ceremonial funeral consists of a military procession where the coffin is borne on a gun carriage from the private resting chapel to Westminster Hall. In a state funeral the gun carriage is pulled by members of the Royal Navy. In a royal ceremonial funeral, the gun carriage is pulled by horses, as opposed to servicemen. The body usually lies in state in Westminster Hall for three days. This is then followed by a funeral service at Westminster Abbey or St. Paul's Cathedral. Many of the features of a state funeral are shared by other types of funerals‚Äîa royal ceremonial funeral (for example, that of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother and Diana, Princess of Wales) often has a lying in state and Westminster Abbey service. The real distinction between a state funeral and a royal ceremonial funeral is that a state funeral requires a motion or vote in Parliament. State funerals are usually reserved for sovereigns, though on rare occasions, they may be granted to distinguished citizens with exceptional contributions to the country. Other members of the royal family, or occasionally politicians, typically receive ceremonial funerals instead. The most recent state funeral was that of Sir Winston Churchill in 1965. Although technically following her divorce from the Prince of Wales in 1996, Diana, Princess of Wales was no longer a member of the Royal Family, and as such not entitled to a state or ceremonial funeral, the large outpouring of public grief following her death led then-Prime Minister Tony Blair to recommend a ceremonial funeral because she was the mother of Princes William and Harry, who were then respectively second and third in the line of succession to the British throne. Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother and Margaret, Baroness Thatcher also received ceremonial funerals.  Ex Yugoslavia  A massive state funeral was held for the late President Josip Broz Tito on 8 May 1980 in Belgrade, the capital city of the SFR Yugoslavia. It was the largest funeral of a statesman in the 20th century, with 129 delegations from all around the world.Tito's funeral drew many statesmen to Belgrade. Notably absent statesmen from funeral were Jimmy Carter and Fidel Castro. His death came in the moment when Soviet invasion of Afghanistan ended American-Soviet d√©tente. Yugoslavia, although a communist state, was non-aligned during the Cold War and fearful that the nation might be invaded like Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan. After learning that Chinese Premier Hua Guofeng would lead the delegation of China, ailing Leonid Brezhnev decided to lead the Soviet delegation. In order to avoid meeting with Leonid Brezhnev and the middle of electoral campaign for the 1980 United States Presidential election, Carter opted to send his mother Lilian Carter and Vice President Walter Mondale as heads of the US delegation. After realizing that leaders of all Warsaw Pact nations would attend the funeral, Carter's decision was criticized by Presidential candidate George H. W. Bush as sign that the United States \\"inferentially slams Yugoslavs at time that country has pulled away from Soviet Union\\". Carter visited Yugoslavia later in June 1980 and made a visit to Tito's grave.Jimmy Carter: \\"Yugoslavia: Conclusion of State Visit Joint Statement. \\", June 29, 1980. Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project. http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=44655. Helmut Schmidt, Chancellor of West Germany was the most active statesman, meeting with Brezhnev, Erich Honecker and Edward Gierek. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher sought to rally world leaders in order to harshly condemn the Soviet invasion. While she was in Belgrade, she held talks with Kenneth Kaunda, Schmidt, Francesco Cossiga and Nicolae Ceau»ôescu. Brezhnev met with Kim Il- sung and Honecker. James Callaghan, President of the British Labour Party explained his presence in Belgrade as attempt to warm relations between his party and Yugoslav communists, severed more than a decade ago after dissident Milovan ƒêilas was welcomed by Jennie Lee, Minister for the Arts under Harold Wilson. Mondale avoided Soviets, ignoring Brezhnev while passing close to him. Soviet and Chinese delegations also avoided each other. Tito was interred on May 8 twice. First interment was for cameras and dignitaries. Grave was shallow with only 200 kg replica of sarcophagus. Second interment was held privately during the night. His coffin was removed, shallow grave was deepened. Coffin was enclosed with copper mask and interred again into much deeper grave which was sealed with cement and topped with a 9-ton sarcophagus. Communist officials were afraid that someone might steal the corpse, similarly to what happened to Charlie Chaplin. However, the 9 ton sarcophagus had to be put in place with a crane, which would make funeral unattractive.

At its height, the company became a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index, before merging into the Wanadoo group in 2000. It then became a subsidiary of France Telecom, who owned a controlling interest in Wanadoo. Wanadoo rebranded over time and eventually became Orange Home UK. Since the merger of Orange UK into EE, Orange Home UK was integrated as a service within EE's range of services. History The company was founded in 1998 as project between Dixons Group plc and Leeds-based hosting provider Planet Online to provide free Internet access to customers buying new home PCs from Dixons stores. The concept was the brainchild of Ajaz Ahmed MEB who was an employee at Dixons at the time. He grew frustrated of not being able to get online without technical knowhow and so sought about a better way for PC owners to get online. Initially the concept was called Channel 6 and was between Packard Bell and Planet Online. Packard Bell pulled out and Dixons (who resold their PCs) stepped in as joint partner. Freeserve was one of the first of the UK's ISPs to dispense with the usual monthly subscription fee for Internet access, and instead to collect a proportion of the standard telephone line charges. This made it more appealing and affordable to the masses and paved way for more people gaining internet access in the UK. (At the time virtually all Internet access in the UK was by dial-up access via BT lines.) With Freeserve however each customer had 10 megabytes of webspace, and could split the email address into as many names as desired, using a simple extension of the normal email naming protocols (user@freeserve.co.uk could subdivide into email for dad@user.freeserve.co.uk and mum@user.freeserve.co.uk etc.). At the time, not having a standing charge for such a comprehensive service, especially the webspace, was a radical step. Further revenue was obtained from advertisements on Freeserve's homepage, which was set as the default page in the customers' web browsers upon installing the Freeserve connection software. BT sought to challenge Freeserve's business plan by arguing that under the regulatory model (known as Number Translation Services, or NTS), it should receive more money for each call, and in January 1999 Oftel announced that it would carry out a review.Freeserve rocks UK net industry Freeserve floated on the stock market in July 1999 (as Freeserve.com plc), at which point they had approximately 1.3 million subscribers and were valued at between ¬£1.31bn and ¬£1.51bn ($2.02bn - $2.34bn).Freeserve gets a price tag By September 2000, Freeserve had more than two million active subscribers.Freeserve losses double This was vastly more than the incumbent telephone provider BT, something that was unique for a European ISP. Freeserve was bought by the France T√©l√©com-owned company Wanadoo in 2000 for ¬£1.65bn ($2.37bn).French rival seals Freeserve deal Freeserve began to trial the emerging ADSL broadband service in early 2000. The original equipment supplied was a rack-type hard-wired modem and a separate router. A year later, the supplied end-user equipment was just a small USB-based modem, the Thomson SpeedTouch 330. Later, as Orange, they supplied a wireless ADSL modem router, the Orange-badged Siemens SE572, with one Ethernet port. Successive rebrandings After being bought by Wanadoo in 2000, Freeserve first had its name changed to Wanadoo UK plc on 28 April 2004.Certificate of Incorporation on Change of Name Following a new rebranding exercise in June 2006, Freeserve and Wanadoo UK then formed part of the UK operation of Orange, and were known as Orange Home UK plc. In 2010 Orange UK and T-Mobile UK merged to form EE which was a joint venture between Deutsche Telekom and France T√©l√©com. Orange's broadband service was then rebranded as EE Broadband on 30 October 2012.http://www.t-mobile.co.uk/ee/home-broadband/ Deactivation In August 2007, Orange started a process to purge unused Freeserve accounts from its system.Orange mounts sneaky Freeserve accounts purge Originally Freeserve accounts would be deactivated after ninety days if the dial-up number was not accessed (hence not generating any revenue for Orange). Customers would then receive an error message when trying to access their Freeserve email via another connection, but could reactivate the account before it was deleted by simply visiting the Orange website.

Although a few seconds may not result in problems, longer periods are dangerous. Short periods may occur without symptoms, or present with lightheadedness, palpitations, or chest pain. Ventricular tachycardia may result in ventricular fibrillation and turn into sudden death. It is found initially in about 7% of people in cardiac arrest. Ventricular tachycardia can occur due to coronary heart disease, aortic stenosis, cardiomyopathy, electrolyte problems, or a heart attack. Diagnosis is by an electrocardiogram (ECG) showing a rate of greater than 120 beats per minute and at least three wide QRS complexes in a row. It is classified as non-sustained versus sustained based on whether it lasts less than or more than 30 seconds. The term ventricular arrhythmia refers to the group of abnormal cardiac rhythms originating from the ventricle, which includes ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and torsades de pointes. In those who have normal blood pressure and strong pulse, the antiarrhythmic medication procainamide may be used. Otherwise, immediate cardioversion is recommended. In those in cardiac arrest due to ventricular tachycardia, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation is recommended. Biphasic defibrillation may be better than monophasic. While waiting for a defibrillator, a precordial thump may be attempted in those on a heart monitor who are seen going into an unstable ventricular tachycardia. In those with cardiac arrest due to ventricular tachycardia, survival is about 45%. An implantable cardiac defibrillator or medications such as calcium channel blockers or amiodarone may be used to prevent recurrence. Signs and symptoms While a few seconds may not result in problems, longer periods are dangerous. Short periods may occur without symptoms or present with lightheadedness, palpitations, or chest pain. Ventricular tachycardia may result in cardiac arrest and turn into ventricular fibrillation. Cause Ventricular tachycardia can occur due to coronary heart disease, aortic stenosis, cardiomyopathy, electrolyte problems (e.g., low blood levels of magnesium or potassium), inherited channelopathies (e.g., long-QT syndrome), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, or a myocardial infarction. Pathophysiology The morphology of the tachycardia depends on its cause and the origin of the re-entry electrical circuit in the heart. In monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, the shape of each heart beat on the ECG looks the same because the impulse is either being generated from increased automaticity of a single point in either the left or the right ventricle, or due to a reentry circuit within the ventricle. The most common cause of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia is scarring of the heart muscle from a previous myocardial infarction (heart attack). This scar cannot conduct electrical activity, so there is a potential circuit around the scar that results in the tachycardia. This is similar to the re-entrant circuits that are the cause of atrial flutter and the re-entrant forms of supraventricular tachycardia. Other rarer congenital causes of monomorphic VT include right ventricular dysplasia, and right and left ventricular outflow tract VT. Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, on the other hand, is most commonly caused by abnormalities of ventricular muscle repolarization. The predisposition to this problem usually manifests on the ECG as a prolongation of the QT interval. QT prolongation may be congenital or acquired. Congenital problems include long QT syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Acquired problems are usually related to drug toxicity or electrolyte abnormalities, but can occur as a result of myocardial ischemia. Class III anti-arrhythmic drugs such as sotalol and amiodarone prolong the QT interval and may in some circumstances be pro-arrhythmic. Other relatively common drugs including some antibiotics and antihistamines may also be a danger, in particular in combination with one another. Problems with blood levels of potassium, magnesium and calcium may also contribute. High-dose magnesium is often used as an antidote in cardiac arrest protocols. Diagnosis The diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia is made based on the rhythm seen on either a 12-lead ECG or a telemetry rhythm strip. It may be very difficult to differentiate between ventricular tachycardia and a wide-complex supraventricular tachycardia in some cases. In particular, supraventricular tachycardias with aberrant conduction from a pre- existing bundle branch block are commonly misdiagnosed as ventricular tachycardia. Other rarer phenomena include Ashman beats and antedromic atrioventricular re-entry tachycardias. Various diagnostic criteria have been developed to determine whether a wide complex tachycardia is ventricular tachycardia or a more benign rhythm. In addition to these diagnostic criteria, if the individual has a past history of a myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or recent angina, the wide complex tachycardia is much more likely to be ventricular tachycardia. The proper diagnosis is important, as the misdiagnosis of supraventricular tachycardia when ventricular tachycardia is present is associated with worse prognosis. This is particularly true if calcium channel blockers, such as verapamil, are used to attempt to terminate a presumed supraventricular tachycardia. Therefore, it is wisest to assume that all wide complex tachycardia is VT until proven otherwise. Classification sinus top, ventricular tachycardia bottom 12 lead electrocardiogram showing a run of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) Ventricular tachycardia can be classified based on its morphology: * Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia means that the appearance of all the beats match each other in each lead of a surface electrocardiogram (ECG). **Scar- related monomorphic ventricular tachycardia is the most common type and a frequent cause of death in patients having survived a heart attack, especially if they have weak heart muscle. **Right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) tachycardia is a type of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia originating in the right ventricular outflow tract. RVOT morphology refers to the characteristic pattern of this type of tachycardia on an ECG. **The source of the re-entry circuit can be identified by evaluating the morphology of the QRS complex in the V1 lead of a surface ECG. If the R wave is dominant (consistent with a right bundle branch block morphology), this indicates the origin of the VT is the left ventricle. Conversely, if the S wave is dominant (consistent with a left bundle branch block morphology, this is consistent with VT originating from the right ventricle or interventricular septum. * Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, on the other hand, has beat-to-beat variations in morphology. This may appear as a cyclical progressive change in cardiac axis, previously referred to by its French name torsades de pointes (\\"twisting of the spikes\\"). However, at the current time, the term torsades de pointes is reserved for polymorphic VT occurring in the context of a prolonged resting QT interval. Another way to classify ventricular tachycardias is the duration of the episodes: Three or more beats in a row on an ECG that originate from the ventricle at a rate of more than 120 beats per minute constitute a ventricular tachycardia. * If the fast rhythm self-terminates within 30 seconds, it is considered a non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. * If the rhythm lasts more than 30 seconds, it is known as a sustained ventricular tachycardia (even if it terminates on its own after 30 seconds). A third way to classify ventricular tachycardia is on the basis of its symptoms: Pulseless VT is associated with no effective cardiac output, hence, no effective pulse, and is a cause of cardiac arrest. In this circumstance, it is best treated the same way as ventricular fibrillation (VF), and is recognized as one of the shockable rhythms on the cardiac arrest protocol. Some VT is associated with reasonable cardiac output and may even be asymptomatic. The heart usually tolerates this rhythm poorly in the medium to long term, and patients may certainly deteriorate to pulseless VT or to VF. Occasionally in ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular impulses are conducted to the ventricles, generating QRS complexes with normal or aberrant supraventricular morphology (ventricular capture). Or, those impulses can be merged with complexes that are originated in the ventricle and produce a summation pattern (fusion complexes). Less common is ventricular tachycardia that occurs in individuals with structurally normal hearts. This is known as idiopathic ventricular tachycardia and in the monomorphic form coincides with little or no increased risk of sudden cardiac death. In general, idiopathic ventricular tachycardia occurs in younger individuals diagnosed with VT. While the causes of idiopathic VT are not known, in general it is presumed to be congenital, and can be brought on by any number of diverse factors. Treatment Therapy may be directed either at terminating an episode of the abnormal heart rhythm or at reducing the risk of another VT episode. The treatment for stable VT is tailored to the specific person, with regard to how well the individual tolerates episodes of ventricular tachycardia, how frequently episodes occur, their comorbidities, and their wishes. Individuals suffering from pulseless VT or unstable VT are hemodynamically compromised and require immediate electric cardioversion to shock them out of the VT rhythm.Kasper, D. (2012). The Tachyarrhythmias. In Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine (18th ed., Vol. 2, pp. 1892-1893). New York: McGraw-Hill, Medical Pub. Division. Cardioversion If a person still has a pulse, it is usually possible to terminate the episode using electric cardioversion. This should be synchronized to the heartbeat if the waveform is monomorphic if possible, in order to avoid degeneration of the rhythm to ventricular fibrillation. An initial energy of 100J is recommended. If the waveform is polymorphic, then higher energies and an unsynchronized shock should be provided (also known as defibrillation). Defibrillation A person with pulseless VT is treated the same as ventricular fibrillation with high-energy (360J with a monophasic defibrillator, or 200J with a biphasic defibrillator) unsynchronised cardioversion (defibrillation). They will be unconscious. The shock may be delivered to the outside of the chest using the two pads of an external defibrillator, or internally to the heart by an implantable cardioverter- defibrillator (ICD) if one has previously been inserted. An ICD may also be set to attempt to overdrive pace the ventricle. Pacing the ventricle at a rate faster than the underlying tachycardia can sometimes be effective in terminating the rhythm. If this fails after a short trial, the ICD will usually stop pacing, charge up and deliver a defibrillation grade shock. Medication For those who are stable with a monomorphic waveform the medications procainamide or sotalol may be used and are better than lidocaine. Evidence does not show that amiodarone is better than procainamide. As a low magnesium level in the blood is a common cause of VT, magnesium sulfate can be given for torsades de pointes or if a low blood magnesium level is found/suspected. Long-term anti-arrhythmic therapy may be indicated to prevent recurrence of VT. Beta-blockers and a number of class III anti-arrhythmics are commonly used, such as the beta-blockers carvedilol, metoprolol, and bisoprolol, and the Potassium-Channel-Blockers amiodarone, dronedarone, bretylium, sotalol, ibutilide, and dofetilide. Angiotensin-converting-eynsyme (ACE) inhibitors and aldosterone antagonists are also sometimes used in this setting.Compton, Steven J. MD, FACC, FACP, FHRS https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/159075-overview RET. NOV. 17 2017. 22:08 CST Surgery An implantable ICD is more effective than drug therapy for prevention of sudden cardiac death due to VT and VF, but may be constrained by cost issues, as well as patient co-morbidities and patient preference. Catheter ablation is a possible treatment for those with recurrent VT. Remote magnetic navigation is one effective method to do the procedure. There was consensus among the task force members that catheter ablation for VT should be considered early in the treatment of patients with recurrent VT. In the past, ablation was often not considered until pharmacological options had been exhausted, often after the patient had suffered substantial morbidity from recurrent episodes of VT and ICD shocks. Antiarrhythmic medications can reduce the frequency of ICD therapies, but have disappointing efficacy and side effects. Advances in technology and understanding of VT substrates now allow ablation of multiple and unstable VTs with acceptable safety and efficacy, even in patients with advanced heart disease.

Lombardo played drums on nine Slayer albums, including, Reign in Blood (1986) and Christ Illusion (2006). He received critical praise for both of these albums. Lombardo's music career has spanned forty years, during which he has been involved in the production of thirty-five commercial recordings covering a number of genres. He has performed with numerous bands, including Grip Inc., Philm, Fant√¥mas, Testament, and Suicidal Tendencies, in addition to Slayer. Lombardo is currently playing drums with Fant√¥mas, Suicidal Tendencies, Dead Cross, Mr. Bungle and the Misfits. Lombardo is widely known as an aggressive heavy metal drummer. His drumming has been praised as \\"astonishingly innovative\\".Jem Aswad & Ira Robbins, \\"Slayer\\" Overview, at TrouserPress.com . Retrieved September 9, 2006. Drummerworld named him \\"the Godfather of Double Bass\\". He has had a significant influence on the metal scene and inspired modern metal drummers, particularly extreme metal drummers. Biography Early years Lombardo was born in Havana, Cuba, on February 16, 1965, where his father owned three meat markets. Lombardo moved with his family to South Gate, California, when he was two years old, and still speaks Spanish. He has two older brothers and an older sister; his brothers had previously emigrated to the US via Operation Peter Pan. His musical interests were fueled by his first musical performance when he was eight years old; he played bongos to Santana's \\"Everybody's Everything\\". Lombardo joined his school's band and played the marching drum. After noticing his son's persistent interest in music, Lombardo's father bought him a five-piece Pearl Maxwin drum set for $350 when Lombardo was ten years old. Lombardo bought his first record, Alive! by Kiss, to play along with. He learned to play Kiss' \\"100,000 Years\\" by repeatedly listening to the record until he could play the drum solo perfectly. Lombardo asked his parents for drum lessons. Although they agreed, the lessons were short-lived. Lombardo grew bored because the lessons were repetitive and did not challenge him. Lombardo's friends introduced him to disco, which appealed to his affinity for funk, Latin and soul. He became a temporary DJ for a mobile disc jockey under the name A Touch of Class. Unimpressed with their son coming home at 4:00am, Lombardo's parents pressured him into quitting the DJ gig or face military school. Lombardo returned to playing rock music in 1978 and befriended several like-minded musicians around South Gate. Lombardo moved to Pius X High School after eighth grade. He performed Chuck Berry's \\"Johnny B. Goode\\" with a guitarist named Peter Fashing during the school's talent show. \\"I'll never forget the roar of the crowd during the drum solo. We brought the house down,\\" said Lombardo, who became known as \\"David the Drummer\\" the following day. Lombardo soon formed a band named Escape with two guitarists. Lombardo found a vocalist to join the band after he transferred to South Gate High School in 1979. The band performed at several events under the name Sabotage, but the band was short-lived. Lombardo's parents convinced him to quit the band because he was withdrawing from everything except music. Knowing her son was set on pursuing a life on the stage, Lombardo's mother asked him to at least graduate high school. He honored her wish and graduated from South Gate High School in June 1983. Immediately following, Lombardo was recommended by his Technical Drafting teacher to Diesel Energy Systems Company. Impressed with his skill, Lombardo was hired on the spot. Around this time, Lombardo's musical career was ready to take off. Music career Slayer When he was sixteen, Lombardo's friends told him about a guitar player, Kerry King, who lived a few blocks away. Lombardo dropped by King's house to meet him. Lombardo introduced himself, mentioned he played drums and shared that he wanted to start a band. King jammed with Lombardo and later showed Lombardo his guitar collection. The two quickly realized they shared some of the same musical interests. After rehearsing in Lombardo's garage several times, King introduced the drummer to another guitarist named Jeff Hanneman. The three rehearsed several times before they decided they needed a singer and bass player. King had previously played with Tom Araya in a band called Quits and decided to introduce Araya to Lombardo and Hanneman. With Slayer's line-up now complete, Lombardo stabbed out the now iconic logo and the band began to develop their groundbreaking sound. Slayer recorded their debut album Show No Mercy soon after. Lombardo enlisted producer Rick Rubin for their third album \\"Reign in Blood\\" (1986). Lombardo left the band during their tour to promote Reign in Blood, stating, \\"I wasn't making any money. I figured if we were gonna be doing this professionally, on a major label, I wanted my rent and utilities paid.\\" Tony Scaglione of Whiplash was enlisted to replace Lombardo. Unhappy with the change, Rick Rubin repeatedly called Lombardo asking his return. Lombardo initially refused before eventually returning to the band in 1987. Lombardo recorded drums on the Slayer albums South of Heaven (1988) and Seasons in the Abyss (1990). He left the band again in 1992. Lombardo left Slayer because he wanted to be present for his first child's birth. Lombardo told his bandmates at the beginning of the pregnancy, stating he would be unable to tour the last two weeks of September. He got a phone call from Slayer's manager, Rick Sales, stating that they were booking a festival in September. Lombardo, however, was firm in his decision and insisted he would not miss his child's birth. Ten years after leaving Slayer, Lombardo got a phone call from the band in 2001, asking if he would like to perform a few shows. Jeff was eager for Dave to return, but Kerry was less enthusiastic. King thought Dave was not up to snuff, but was \\"blown away\\" by Dave's performance in rehearsals. Kerry later said, \\"He's [Lombardo] got the feet and he's got the hands, he's not missing a step.\\" Lombardo decided to resume drumming duties. His first show was at Toad's Place in New Haven, Connecticut on 24 January 2002. At the beginning of the band's show at The 7 Flags Event Center near Des Moines, Iowa on 2 February 2002, Araya welcomed Lombardo's return and dedicated the show to Exodus vocalist Paul Baloff, who had died earlier that day. Lombardo toured with Slayer as part of Ozzfest, H82k2, Summer Tour, and the 2004 Download Festival. While preparing for the Download Festival in England, Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich was hospitalized for a mysterious illness. Metallica's vocalist James Hetfield searched for volunteers to replace Ulrich; Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison, Flemming Larsen (Ulrich's drum technician) and Lombardo volunteered. Lombardo performed the songs \\"Battery\\" and \\"The Four Horsemen\\", while Jordison and Larsen performed the rest of the songs. Lombardo recorded drums on Slayer's 2006 release Christ Illusion, promoting the album on The Unholy Alliance tour. King said Lombardo was a major attraction for the fans, and one of the reasons for their surge in popularity. King and other band members preferred Lombardo on drums. Araya said, \\"It's kind of right back where we started. He's an amazing performer. We took off right where we left off, you know? It's like he was never gone. He's working with Kerry on his tunes. He's helped out a lot actually!\\" Christ Illusion received generally favorable reviews with critics praising Lombardo's return. Chris Steffen of Rolling Stone wrote, \\"Christ Illusion is God Hates Us All without the memorable riffs, at least their awesome drummer Dave Lombardo shows off some chops, particularly on the raging 'Supremist.'\\" Don Kaye of Blabbermouth gave the album a favorable review and praised Lombardo. Kaye wrote, \\"One thing's for sure: Lombardo's influence on this band is absolutely undeniable. He is simply essential to the Slayer sound. He is one of metal's all-around best drummers, perhaps the very best in the field of thrash/speed metal, and his power, style, and chops ‚Äì not to mention his intangible chemistry with the rest of the group and those amazing flying feet ‚Äì bring Slayer's overall performance, intensity and music to a higher level.\\" Lombardo recorded another album with Slayer in 2009, titled World Painted Blood. Lombardo left the band once again in February 2013 shortly before the band was due to play Australia's Soundwave festival. He left following a contract and pay dispute with band members. Grip Inc. After the birth of his first child in 1993, Lombardo formed Grip Inc. with Voodoocult guitarist Waldemar Sorychta. The pair recruited bassist Jason Viebrooks and vocalist Gus Chambers to complete the line-up. An early 5-piece line-up briefly featured former Overkill guitarist Bobby Gustafson who claims to have come up with the name Grip which Lombardo expanded to Grip Inc. after Gustafson's departure in order to avoid a potential lawsuit. Grip Inc.'s debut record was released in 1995. The album, titled Power of Inner Strength, was distributed via California-based label Metal Blade Records. All-music reviewer Vincent Jeffries singled out Lombardo for praise on the album, saying Slayer fans would \\"enjoy the drummer's double bass work and overall aggression throughout the disc.\\" Sorychta claimed critics and music fans always spot mistakes in their music, because of Lombardo's popularity with Slayer‚Äîthey expect the band to sound like Slayer and complain. However, when Lombardo uses the double bass drum, Sorychta said people complain \\"now Grip Inc. sound exactly like Slayer.\\"[7] The band released Nemesis in 1997. Jeffries praised Lombardo's \\"crushing drum work\\" which takes center stage on the album. Bassist Viebrooks left the band in 1999; he was replaced by Stuart Carruthers. The band released Solidify later that year. The album was described as a step towards \\"progressive and exotic rhythms, structures, and instrumentation, while never compromising intensity\\". Lombardo was once again praised for his drumming on the album by Jeffries, who stated his style is \\"expressive and technically excellent tom work on cuts like 'Bug Juice' and 'Lockdown.'\\" Lombardo is proud of Grip Inc. and believes it made him more creative as a musician. Lombardo recorded his final album with Grip Inc., Incorporated, in 2004. He said the band is on the \\"back burner\\" because of time taken up touring with Slayer. Philm In 1997, Lombardo began collaborating with vocalist/guitarist Gerry Nestler and bassist Juan Perez after the demise of their former band, Civil Defiance. Initially called Letter Bomb, the experimental trio later changed the name to Philm. The group played shows in the LA area and worked on material at Lombardo's Victorville, CA home studio until Lombardo returned to Slayer in 2001. Nestler and Perez kept going with new drummer George Hernandez, releasing the M album under the name Kkleq Muzzil in 2002. Lombardo and Nestler both guested on DJ Spooky's 2005 album, Drums of Death, and eventually reformed Philm in early 2010 after a jam at the famous Rainbow Bar and Grill in West Hollywood, CA, recruiting War‚Äôs Francisco ‚ÄòPancho‚Äô Tomaselli on bass. The band initially recorded a 3-song demo with producer Piers Baron; The first release came in August 2010 in the form of a 7\\" single, a cover of the Black Sabbath classic Symptom of the Universe. It was issued by Volcom Entertainment as part of the Volcom Vinyl Club in translucent blue vinyl, limited to 500 copies. Philm would play a run of U.S. dates as openers for Halford in late 2010 and signed with Mike Patton‚Äôs Ipecac label for the release of their 2012 debut album, ‚ÄòHarmonic‚Äô, which included updated versions of the songs \\"Amoniac\\", \\"Dome\\" and \\"Meditation\\", written by the original Philm line-up and first released by Kkleq Muzzil on the M album. In October 2013, Lombardo, Nestler and stand-in bass player Dan Lutz performed the world live premier of composer Christopher Young's Suite from Ghost Rider with the Golden State Pops Orchestra at the Warner Grand Theatre in Los Angeles, CA as part of an evening of horror movie scores performed with a 75-piece orchestra. In July 2014, Philm announced a new partnership with German-based company UDR Records for the release of the group's sophomore effort, ‚ÄòFire From the Evening Sun‚Äô. The album was supported with a European tour in the fall of 2014. In a September 2015 interview, Lombardo talked about plans for the next Philm release, a 19-song double album recorded in New York City. \\"It's called 'Philm Noir', and that's piano, bass and drums. Gerry (Paul Nestler, guitar/vocals) plays piano really, really, really well, and Pancho (Francisco Tomaselli), obviously, on bass and myself. I tone it down and play with brushes. So, I would say 'Fire From the Evening Sun' is the extreme side of Philm, but then we also have a very avant-garde, jazz and ambient side of Philm, which is 'Philm Noir'.\\" Lombardo abruptly left the group only a couple of months later and proclaimed its demise in early 2016. Nestler and Tomaselli countered with a statement affirming that the band would go on with a new drummer. Venezuelan-born Grammy Award winner, Anderson Quintero, was announced as Lombardo's replacement in September 2016 and made his live debut at the Whiskey A Go-Go that month. Fant√¥mas In 1998, Lombardo joined a side project called Fant√¥mas with Faith No More vocalist Mike Patton and Melvins' guitarist Buzz Osborne. The band formed when Lombardo was approached by Patton at a Faith No More concert; Patton asked Lombardo about his \\"fusion\\" project (Grip Inc.). Patton called Lombardo several months after Faith No More broke up and asked if Lombardo wanted to join Patton's fusion project. Lombardo enthusiastically agreed, \\"Fuck yeah!\\" Lombardo later described Fant√¥mas as the hardest music he has played: \\"Slayer doesn't even come close. Slayer was hard in a physical way, this is physically demanding and requires 'feeling'. (The kind of connectedness that demands) no clicking of sticks.\\" The drummer described Fant√¥mas' sound by stating \\"[I]f Picasso was a musician, this would be his music.\\" Lombardo recorded four albums with the band. Dead Cross Lombardo revealed the formation of yet another new musical project, Dead Cross, in November 2015. With ruthless, hardcore punk music, Rolling Stone described the band as a \\"vicious statement of renewed intent from Lombardo, the most influential drummer of the past 30 years.\\" Dead Cross announced on 12 December 2016 that Mike Patton would front the band. Produced by Ross Robinson and Dead Cross, the band released their eponymous debut album in August 2017. Suicidal Tendencies Lombardo joined crossover-thrash band Suicidal Tendencies in February 2016 and toured with the band for their spring tour with Megadeth and summer European dates. Fans speculated Lombardo was only playing with the band as a fill-in drummer. Those rumors were dispelled, however, when the band posted a video to their Instagram account on May 15, 2016. The video showed Lombardo recording drums for a new album, World Gone Mad. The album was released on 30 September 2016. Misfits In August 2016, Misfits announced Lombardo as their drummer for their reunion shows. Due to the success of the shows, the Misfits announced in August 2017 that they would to do two more. Lombardo would again be on drums. Lombardo performed two shows (12/28/2017) in Las Vegas'NV @ MGM Grand Garden Arena & (12/30/2017) in Los Angeles @ the Forum in which all 16,000 tickets for the show were sold out in less than one minute. Mr. Bungle In 2019, Lombardo was announced as the drummer for the seven upcoming Mr. Bungle reunion shows in 2020 in which the band performed their 1986 Demo The Raging Wrath of The Easter Bunny. In 2020, the band rerecorded the demo, with Lombardo on drums. It is scheduled to be released on October 30th, 2020. Side projects In 1999, Lombardo collaborated with Italian classical musician Lorenzo Arruga to record Vivaldi ‚Äì The Meeting. The seven-track album had drum improvisations on Vivaldi's work including two pieces from The Four Seasons composition. In 2000, Lombardo released a book titled Dave Lombardo:Power Grooves. The book and video contained warm ups, eight, sixteen, and double bass grooves, riding the toms and more. The year 1999 also saw Lombardo perform drum work on the Testament album The Gathering, rounding off a veritable \\"supergroup\\" with Steve DiGiorgio and James Murphy. He has appeared on two albums by John Zorn: Taboo and Exile (1999) and Xu Feng (2000) performing with Zorn, Bill Laswell, Fred Frith, William Winant and others. He also played in Paris with Zorn, Laswell and Frith in an improvisatonal quartet project called Blade Runner. 1999 also saw the release of avant-garde sculptor/filmmaker Matthew Barney's \\"Cremaster 2\\", inspired by the life of Gary Gilmore. Lombardo played an epic drum solo accompanied by a swarm of angry bees on the track \\"The Man in Black\\". In 2005, Lombardo recorded Drums of Death with DJ Spooky. Spooky played some records with Lombardo playing along and interpreting his own rhythms. Spooky recorded the session and took the tapes to his New York recording studio, downloaded it onto his computer, and mixed the beats and drums incorporating scratching and other DJ techniques. Scott Peace-Miller of Glide Magazine noted, \\"Lombardo's influence is front and center in the driving, up tempo \\"Quantum Cyborg Drum Machine,\\" and the almost straight-up thrash of Kultur Krieg.\\" clinic in Italy ‚Äì May 8th, 2014 Lombardo recorded six tracks with the Finnish cello metal group Apocalyptica on their 2003 album Reflections. Members of Apocalyptica had approached Lombardo in 1998 at a drum clinic in the Netherlands titled \\"Headbangers fest\\", and asked if Lombardo would like to do a duo with the band, which he agreed to. Both Lombardo and Apocalyptica enjoyed playing a duo and Lombardo said to Apocalyptica, \\"Whenever you need a drummer, call me!\\". The band sent the recording tapes of Reflections to his home studio in California where he recorded the drums. Lombardo's later Apocalyptica contributions have consisted of playing the drums for the track \\"Betrayal/Forgiveness\\" on the 2005 album Apocalyptica for the track \\"Last Hope\\" on the 2007 album Worlds Collide and for the track \\"2010\\" on the 2010 album 7th Symphony. In October 2009, it was announced that he had recorded a cover of \\"Stand by Me\\", featuring Lemmy on vocals and bass, and produced by DJ and producer Baron. The song was made for legendary pro skateboarder Geoff Rowley. In 2014, Lombardo firmly planted his feet in the world of television and film. His signature sound can be found on many recordings, such as the Season 7 soundtrack for Californication, Dawn of the Dead (2004), and Insidious: Chapter 3 (2015). Style and legacy Lombardo named Bill Ward, Mitch Mitchell, John Bonham, Ian Paice, Ginger Baker and Keith Moon as main influences at early age. He is known for his fast, aggressive style of play utilizing the double bass technique which has earned him the title \\"the godfather of double bass\\" by Drummerworld. Lombardo states his reasons for using two bass drums: \\"when you hit the bass drum the head is still resonating. When you hit it in the same place right after that you kinda get a 'slapback' from the bass drum head hitting the other pedal. You're not letting them breathe.\\" In an interview with Guitar Center in the spring of 2012 he said: \\"I don't like a double pedal because when the beater hits, I immediately come back with the other pedal. And that head is resonating, which creates a momentum that isn't helpful. It throws me off balance. With two bass drums, I don't have any problems. It's just a feel thing.\\" When playing the double bass, Lombardo uses the 'heel-up' technique and places his pedals at an angle.Modern Drummer Festival 2000 As well as considering him an influence, Arch Enemy drummer Daniel Erlandsson feels Lombardo is \\"really tasteful in his playing, and doesn't overplay. He's gifted with a groove that not many speed metal, or metal drummers generally, have.\\" In response to an interview question, \\"How talented is Dave Lombardo?\\" King responded, \\"Have you ever seen the movie The Natural? That's Dave. He doesn't have to try to be good. He comes into the venue 10 or 15 minutes before we hit the stage and he doesn't warm up. He just goes and does it, after me and Jeff [Hanneman, guitarist] have been warming up for like an hour.\\" In an interview with Modern Drummer, Lombardo has stated that when he plays drum beats on the bass drums, he always begins with his left foot. German newspaper Die Zeit named Slayer's Reign in Blood #79 on their list of 100 Classics of Modern Music, with critic Matthias Sch√∂neb√§umer writing: Lombardo's work has been an influence on many rock and heavy metal drummers. Per M√∂ller Jensen of The Haunted cites Lombardo as a major influence, having grown up listening to Slayer; the band was a big influence on his style and The Haunted's. Suffocation drummer Mike Smith also cites Lombardo as an influence. Rocky Gray, former member of the alternative metal band Evanescence was influenced by Lombardo's choice of equipment; \\"All those old school guys are all TAMA guys. Where I'm from, if you're in the big time, you get a TAMA drum set. You have to be good if you've got a TAMA set.\\" Richard Christy, former member of Death was \\"blown away\\" by Lombardo's performance and double bass on the album Reign in Blood, as was Cannibal Corpse drummer Paul Mazurkiewicz. Raymond Herrera of the band Fear Factory cites Lombardo as one of his major influences, as do Pete Sandoval (Morbid Angel), Igor Cavalera (Sepultura, Cavalera Conspiracy), Adrian Erlandsson (Paradise Lost, Cradle of Filth, Brujeria), George Kollias (Nile, Nightfall), Joey Jordison (Slipknot), Dirk Verbeuren (Soilwork), Derek Roddy (Aurora Borealis, Nile, Hate Eternal), Mike Portnoy (Dream Theater, Adrenaline Mob), James Sullivan (Avenged Sevenfold), Steve Asheim (Deicide), Michael \\"Moose\\" Thomas (Bullet for My Valentine), Tony Laureano (Dimmu Borgir, Nile, Angelcorpse, Malevolent Creation), Dave Witte (Municipal Waste, Burnt by the Sun, Black Army Jacket), Max Kolesne (Krisiun), Patrick Gr√ºn (Caliban), Nicholas Barker (Cradle of Filth, Dimmu Borgir) and Jason Bittner (Shadows Fall). Lombardo endorses and uses Tama Drums, Promark Drumsticks, Paiste Cymbals and Evans Drumheads. Lombardo is left handed, but drums right handed and plays a right handed kit. Art Lombardo began the creation of his first art collection, \\"Rhythm Mysterium\\" in early 2014. To execute the project, Lombardo worked with art team Scene Four in Los Angeles, California. The art collection is titled \\"RHYTHM MYSTERIUM\\". Containing 13 works, the collection is built from the new medium of rhythm-on-canvas. In 2015, Lombardo released \\"LOMBARDO\\", a book-and-vinyl set. The book is a comprehensive look at Dave Lombardo's artwork built from rhythm, and the vinyl contains Lombardo's improvised drum interpretations for each art piece within the book.

The breed was originally bred to hunt all types of game from squirrels and other rodents to bears.Morris, p.316. It is a \\"bark pointer\\", indicating the position of game by barking, and drawing the game animal's attention to itself, allowing an easier approach for the hunter. Its original game hunting purpose was to point to game that fled into trees, such as grouse, and capercaillies, but it also serves well for hunting elk. Some individuals have even been known to go after a bear. In its native country, the breed is still mostly used as a hunting dog. The breed is friendly and in general loves children, so it is suitable for domestic life. The Finnish Spitz has been the national dog of Finland since 1979. Lineage The remains of dogs that have been found in Finland and dated from 8,000 years ago are similar in size and shape to Spitz-type dogs.Kristiina Mannermaa, Pirkko Ukkonen & Suvi Viranta PREHISTORY AND EARLY HISTORY OF DOGS IN FINLAND, Fennoscandia archaeologica XXXI (2014)- http://www.sarks.fi/fa/PDF/FA31_25.pdf Nearly all dog breeds‚Äô genetic closeness to the gray wolf is due to admixture. However, several Arctic dog breeds show a genetic closeness with the now- extinct Taymyr wolf of North Asia due to admixture. These breeds are associated with high latitudes - the Siberian husky and Greenland dog that are also associated with arctic human populations, and to a lesser extent the Shar Pei and the Karelo-Finnish Laika. An admixture graph of the Greenland dog indicates a best-fit of 3.5% shared material, however an ancestry proportion ranging between 1.4% and 27.3% is consistent with the data. This indicates admixture between the Taymyr wolf population and the ancestral dog population of these 4 high-latitude breeds. This introgression could have provided early dogs living in high latitudes with phenotypic variation beneficial for adaption to a new and challenging environment. It also indicates the ancestry of present-day dog breeds descends from more than one region. History Finnish Spitz from 1915 The Finnish Spitz developed from selectively bred Spitz-type dogs that inhabited central Russia several thousand years ago. Isolated Finno-Ugrian tribes in the far northern regions bred dogs according to their specific needs.The American Kennel Club, p.508. These small clans of woodsmen relied on their dogs to help them obtain food, and the excellent hunting ability of the Finnish Spitz made it a favorite choice.Nicholas, p.6. By 1880, as advanced means of transportation brought diverse peoples and their dogs together, Finnish Spitzes mated with other breeds of dogs, and were becoming extinct as a distinct breed. At about that time, a Finnish sportsman from Helsinki named Hugo Roos observed the pure native Finnish Spitz while hunting in the northern forests. He realized the many virtues of the pure Finnish Spitz breed and decided to select dogs that were untainted examples of the genuine Finnish Spitz in order to try to revive the breed. Thirty years of careful breeding resulted in the modern Finnish Spitz; the dogs are descendants of his original foundation stock. Love Finnish Kennel Club has revised the breed standard six times, and the latest version was confirmed in 1996. In 1979, when the club celebrated its 90th anniversary, the Finnish Spitz was declared Finland's national dog breed. The club is also working for including the hunting experience with the Finnish Spitz on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List. Appearance The proper conformation is a square build, meaning that the length of the body is the same or slightly shorter than the height of the withers to the ground. The length of the body is measured from the point of the shoulder or forechest in front of the withers to the rump. Females are usually a little longer in the back than males. Both sexes should appear slightly longer in the leg than the back. Dew claws can appear on front and/or back feet. If back claws appear, they should be removed. The front dewclaws can be removed, if desired. Coat The Finnish Spitz has a typical double coat, which consists of a soft, dense undercoat and long, harsh guard hairs that can measure 2.5 to 5 cm (one to two inches) long. The outer coat should not exceed at the ruff. The coat should be stiffer, denser, and longer on the neck, back, back of thighs, and plume of the tail, shorter on the head and legs. Male dogs should sport a slightly longer and coarser coat than female ones, who have a slightly more refined coat. The pluma of the tail is important to the overall look of the dog but should not be too long. Feathered long tail hairs without sustenance can give the dog an unkempt look. Additionally, the tailset is important and the Finnish Spitz should be able to move its tail from one side to the other. Most Finnish Spitz have a preferred side and this is not incorrect. Proper care of the coat is most important. The Finnish Spitz blows coat or loses its undercoat twice a year. It is imperative that owners brush out the old undercoat so the new coat can grow properly. Although a dog may look fluffy and full, excessive undercoat may be causing serious skin problems. In the show ring, the coat should be shown as completely natural; a brush through the coat is acceptable, but no trimming is allowed, not even of whiskers. However, any excessive undercoat should be removed. Some exhibitors choose to show dogs with excessive undercoat to make the dog's coat appear more lush. Failing to shed undercoat is considered neglect by some judges who prefer a clean and combed coat. Another exception is the hair under the bottom of the feet. The hair under the feet as well as the toe nails should be nicely trimmed for show. Color 1989 postage stamp depicting the Finnish Spitz Puppies are often described as looking similar to a red fox cub. They are born dark grey, black, brown, or fawn with a vast amount of black. A fawn-colored puppy or one with a large amount of white of the chest is not preferable for show purposes. The color of the adult dog can be assessed by an experienced breeder at birth, but even then, the color may change slightly as the puppy grows. The adult color is typically a golden-red with variations from pale honey to dark chestnut. There is no preference for a particular shade as long as the color is bright and clear with no hints of dullness. The coat should never be a solid color. It should be shaded and without any defined color changes. The coat is usually at its darkest shade on the back of the dog, gradually getting lighter around the chest and belly. The undercoat must always be lighter in color than the topcoat, but is never allowed to be white. A small patch of white, no more than 1.5 cm (0.6 inches) wide, is allowable on the chest, and white tips on the feet are acceptable, but not desired. The nose, lips, and rims of eyes should always be black. Height and weight Height at withers (American Kennel Club breed standard): *Males: 44.5 to 50.8 cm (17¬Ω to 20 inches) *Females: 39.4 to 45.7 cm (15¬Ω to 18 inches) Weight: *Males: *Females: Temperament This breed is active, alert and lively. They need one or two long walks each day and will be fairly inactive indoors. This breed will not adapt well to a strictly kenneled living situation; they need a balance of outdoor exercise and indoor play time with the family.Cunliffe, p.19 Finnish Spitzes are considered to interact well with people and they are especially good with children. They are always ready to play with children but if ignored, they will usually walk away.Nicholas, p. 24 As with all dogs, young children and dogs should always be supervised when together. It is an independent breed and will be attached to its family while remaining aloof with strangers. The Finnish Spitz tends to be protective; males have more domineering traits than females. Most Finnish Spitzes get along well with other dogs in the house. They are bred as a hunting dog and thus are unreliable around small animals and pet birds, but on an individual basis may live well with cats, especially if they are raised with them.Finnish Spitz Dog Time Barking The breed barks at anything perceived to be out of the ordinary. Barking is a major part of their hunting activities. In Finland, these dogs are prized for their barking abilities, which can range from short, sharp barks to many barks per minute that sound like a yodel. The Finnish Spitz can bark as many as 160 times per minute. In Scandinavia, a competition is held to find the \\"King of the Barkers.\\" Cunliffe, p.21 In Finland, their barking ability in the field must be proven before a conformation championship can be earned.Nicholas, p. 26 When used as a hunting companion, the barking is a way to signal the hunter that the dog has located prey in the forest. They can be trained to reduce the amount of barking, although the barking does make them superb watchdogs. Training Finnish Spitzes are independent, strong- willed, intelligent dogs. They are best trained with a soft voice and touch.Cunliffe, p.20 This breed will not respond well to harsh training methods. They should be trained with a light touch and positive reinforcement methods. With patience and calm yet firm handling, the Finnish Spitz can be a wonderful companion. Health The Finnish Spitz is typically a very healthy breed, with few general health concerns. However, breeders should be consulted to understand the prevalence of a specific disorder in this breed. Below is a short list of what is known to occur: *Hip dysplasia *Patellar luxation *Elbow dysplasia *Epilepsy Median lifespan is about 11.2 years. References Further reading *Morris, Desmond. (2001).

Twelfth Air Force initially assigned the 324th Fighter Group to the airfield on 2 September, with Republic P-47 Thunderbolts. However the 324th only remained a few days before moving forward to Amberieu on 6 September. The main USAAF use of Istres was by the 64th Troop Carrier Group, which operated Douglas C-47 Skytrain transports from the airfield from September to November 1944. When the combat units moved north into eastern France, Istres was used by Air Transport Command as a transshipment point for supplies and Allied personnel, being administratively controlled by the 1411th Army Air Force Base Unit.

She debuted in a preview story inserted within DC Comics Presents #26 (October 1982) and was created by Marv Wolfman and George P√©rez. The name \\"Starfire\\" first appeared in a DC Comic in the story \\"The Answer Man of Space\\", in Mystery in Space #73, February 1962, written by Gardner Fox. In 2013, Starfire placed 21st on IGN's \\"Top 25 Heroes of DC Comics\\".Schedeen, Jesse (November 19, 2013). \\"The Top 25 Heroes of DC Comics\\". IGN. Starfire has appeared in numerous cartoon television shows and films, including as a member of the Teen Titans in Cartoon Network's eponymous series, voiced by Hynden Walch. Koriand'r makes her live adaptation debut in the DC Universe and HBO Max series Titans, played by Anna Diop. Publication history The design of the character (Koriand'r) incorporated aspects of many existing characters. Artist George P√©rez, in explaining the creation of the character, stated: Fictional character biography Koriand'r, Starfire's given name, is a princess of the fictional planet Tamaran in the Vega system, and was in line to rule the planet as queen. Komand'r (also known as Blackfire), her older sister, developed a bitter rivalry with her after suffering a disease in infancy that robbed her of the ability to harness solar energy to allow her to fly, and by extension, her right to the throne. This rivalry continued and intensified when the siblings were sent for warrior training with the Warlords of Okaara. Things came to a head during a sparring exercise in which Komand'r attempted to kill her sister. As a result, Komand'r was expelled and she swore vengeance. That revenge came in a plot where Komand'r betrayed her planet by supplying detailed information about Tamaran's defenses to their enemies, the Citadel. They conquered Tamaran with ease, and the surrender conditions included the enslavement of Koriand'r, who was never permitted to return, since that would mean the Citadel would devastate the planet for abrogating the treaty. To her horror, Koriand'r learned that Komand'r was her master; her own older sister made the most of her sibling's years of horrific servitude. When Koriand'r killed one of her captors, Komand'r decided to execute her as punishment, but the sisters were attacked and captured by the Psions, a group of sadistic alien scientists. While performing deadly experiments on the sisters, the Psion were attacked by Komand'r's forces. Koriand'r broke free using her newly developed starbolts, destructive blasts of ultraviolet energy which were a result of the experiment. She freed Komand'r, who was still absorbing more amounts of ultraviolet energy. Far from grateful, Komand'r struck her sister with the same, but with more intensity and power and had her restrained for later execution. Koriand'r escaped by stealing a spacecraft to flee to the nearest planet, Earth, where she met the first Robin and his compatriots; she joined them in forming the Teen Titans. She became a charter member of this team and remained a member for years, finding work as a professional model using the name Kory Anders. s and other relationships While a member of the Teen Titans, Koriand'r was frequently romantically involved with Robin (Dick Grayson). She has been married twice, both times to Tamaranean men: once to the Prince Karras to seal a peace treaty; and once to General Phy'zzon out of love. Karras died in battle, while Phy'zzon died trying to defend New Tamaran against the Sun Eater. In between these, she nearly married Dick Grayson, but their wedding was interrupted by Raven (who was evil at the time). Raven murdered the priest before he could pronounce Dick and Koriand'r husband and wife but canonically they were still married regardless (Flash vol 2. #81-83 The Flash Vol 2 81). The relationship was already on unsteady ground after Raven came in, with Koriand'r fearing that Dick was rushing into marriage and also concerned about the anti-alien sentiments that sprang up in response to the news of the impending nuptials. In the Titans of Tomorrow storyline, Batwoman said that Starfire would have a wonderful future with Nightwing. The half-blood Mar'i Grayson was born from their union in the Kingdom Come timeline. However, during Infinite Crisis, an image from the Titans Tomorrow timeline shows a gravestone implied to belong to a deceased Dick Grayson.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #33 (April 2006) Infinite Crisis During Infinite Crisis, Starfire joined Donna's New Cronus Team that went to investigate a hole in the universe that was found during the Rann-Thanagar War. They arrived at the reset center of the universe and with the help of assorted heroes aided in the defeat of Alexander Luthor, who was attempting to recreate the multiverse and build a perfect Earth from it. She is reported missing at the end of the crisis. 52 On the seventh day of the fifth week of 52, Starfire is shown to be stranded on a paradise-like planet with Animal Man and Adam Strange. In the same issue, it was revealed that energy ripples caused by Alexander Luthor, Jr., altered the Zeta Ray Beams the space heroes were going to use to return home; among other things, it caused the trio to be teleported together to the planet. A week and some time later, Starfire is seen eating an odd narcotic native fruit. Luckily, Adam's tough love seems to snap her out of it, or at least make her stop eating the fruit. Two days later, Devilance, a being whose presence Buddy had sensed earlier, appears to Starfire. A week, two days, and two nights later, Adam and Buddy go looking for her. Unfortunately, they find her caught in a large net, hanging from above. Just as Buddy realizes it is a trap, he and Adam get caught in a similar net, with Devilance staring at them. Three days and two nights later, Starfire awakens and works together with her comrades to distract Devilance. She pays Devilance back for capturing her by stealing his staff and striking him with it before catching up with Buddy and Adam. As the trio head back to the ship, hoping to use the staff as a power source, Devilance broods, bound by the same vines he had used to restrain his captives. At the end of week 16, the repairs on the ship are completed and the trio take off for Earth. Devilance later suddenly attacks the ship and takes back his lance. Just as Devilance is about to destroy the ship, he is torn apart by Lobo. Believing he is going to attack them next, Starfire convinces Lobo to help the trio by offering payment, but not before he rips her top off. She returns to the ship to explain the situation to her companions while Lobo hitches the ship to his space bike. They follow Lobo in his new stronghold in Sector 3500, a sector of space mysteriously ravaged, and ruled by Lobo acting as religious man. To save him, and the inhabitants, from a swarm of strange creatures, Starfire is forced to use the Emerald Eye of Ekron, alerting Ekron himself. The ragtag team is then forced to flee, with Lobo acting as their guide, gaining Ekron's help and discovering their real enemy, Lady Styx, bringing havoc and mayhem in the entire Galaxy. Starfire agrees to fight her, and she is brought as a prisoner of the galactic villainess by Lobo, in an attempt to foil her defences. The attempt succeeds, but Buddy is seemingly killed, and Lobo leaves. Starfire and Adam are left alone in space, their ship slowly breaking apart, still pursued by angry Lady Styx followers. Starfire is badly injured, and a blind Adam Strange, who is reliant on machinery which is no longer useful, cannot do anything to help her. Just as they are going to crash into a sun, however, Mogo and a rookie Green Lantern come to their rescue. Cured, but still recovering, she travels to Earth in order to return Buddy's jacket back to his wife Ellen, unaware that Buddy was resurrected and arrived on Earth shortly before her. Upon her return, she manages to destroy two of Lady Styx's followers who were attacking Buddy and his wife. She then returns Buddy's jacket to his wife, before passing out from exhaustion and is left in the care of the Baker Family. Countdown to Adventure Starfire, Adam Strange, and Animal Man are fated to join forces again in the coming Countdown to Adventure eight-issue miniseries. In issue one of the series, Starfire discovers her powers have gone but decides to make an attempt at a normal life. Buddy invites her to stay with the family as an after-school sitter despite Ellen's discomfort with how close Buddy and Starfire seem. This worsens when Buddy's son attacks Kory whilst under the effects of Lady Styx's virus. Animal Man's decision to follow Starfire rather than watch over his son in the hospital leads Ellen to ask if he is in love with her, to which Buddy does not reply. Despite the loss of her powers, Starfire demonstrates her combat abilities as she and Animal Man fight off crowds of people infected by the virus. They are later trapped in San Diego with the infectees where they are joined by the Teen Titans who are trying to break through a force field to get to the Healers ship. After Buddy is captured, Ellen joins Starfire to save Animal Man from dissection. They are then interrupted by more victims of the Lady Styx virus. Alanna and Adam Strange arrive at the scene via the Zeta Beam and meet up with Starfire and Ellen Baker. They then save Buddy and teleport with the aid of the Zeta Beam to Rann to restore Starfire's powers. After being teleported to Rann, Starfire recharges her powers and rids Rann of the Lady Styx virus. The team finds out that the sterilization is taking place in San Diego. Starfire uses her powers to heal the people, and is later seen leaving the Baker household for parts unknown. Starfire, Animal Man, Ellen, and Adam Strange are teleported by a broken Zeta Beam to Earth. Starfire attempts to rid the disease but is soon tackled by Champ Hazard into the ground. Adam Strange blasts Champ off Kory and she cures San Diego of the Lady Styx virus. She then leaves the Baker's household to return to the Titans. Rann-Thanagar Holy War The trio again join forces in the Rann-Thanagar Holy war. After a meeting at Titans Tower, Adam Strange Zeta Beams Starfire and Animal Man to Rann. Apparently the belief of Lady Styx still remained even after the virus has been eliminated. Their plan is to use a telepath to show the horror of Lady Styx. Titans Together After the apparent defeat of Lady Styx, Starfire once again returned to Animal Man's home. One afternoon, she and Animal Man's son were attacked by a water demon in Buddy's swimming pool. Meanwhile, her old Titan teammates had also been attacked by assorted demonic entities. This led to Starfire, Nightwing, Troia, Cyborg, Beast Boy, Raven, Kid Flash, and Red Arrow, to reassemble as a team, when they realized that the attacks are the result of a resurrected Trigon and his newly discovered three sons. While investigating, the Titans began to experience unexplained mood-shifts. Soon after, the team met up in New York's Central Park, where they attempted to recover from these mood-shifts and realize that each shift coincided with one of the seven deadly sins. The team was then approached by the Sons of Trigon. They battled the villainous progeny, and drove them away. Starfire and Nightwing then discuss their actions while under the influence of Trigon's sons. While Nightwing shows hints at wanting to renew their relationship, Starfire questions his commitment to the relationship and goes so far as to ask Nightwing whether or not he truly still loves her. Nightwing to his own surprise and reluctance admits he does not, leading to them for now leaving their reunion in doubt. Most recently, she has been captured and turned into a Justifier, as seen in Final Crisis: Resist. She has since been freed, although the loss of control she gathered from the Justifier helmet distressed her severely. She was more than happy to destroy a warehouse full of them when Mister Terrific offered her and Cyborg to destroy them. Blackest Night During Hero's Day, a time when the heroes of the DC Universe join together in remembrance of dead comrades, Starfire and the Titans were attacked by Black Lantern versions of their fallen teammates. During the battle, Starfire and Cyborg were subjected to a psychic attack by the Black Lantern Omen, putting them both in a euphoric state as they experienced their greatest desires (for Starfire, marrying Dick Grayson). Both she and Cyborg were rescued by Beast Boy. Justice League and R.E.B.E.L.S. Following the dissolution of the current JLA after Blackest Night, Starfire is invited by Donna to join Kimiyo Hoshi's new Justice League.Justice League of America (vol. 2) #41 (January 2010) After a short time with the team, Starfire quit the team and left a note to Dick explaining why. She then returns to where Tamaran used to be, to find that it had mysteriously returned. It is revealed that Vril Dox of Legion has moved the planet Rann where Tamaran used to be. Starfire agrees to join Legion and enters into a relationship with Captain Comet. Soon Tamaranean refugees, led by Blackfire, attack Rann believing that since the planet was in Tamaran's orbit they had claim to it. The violence was ended when Vril Dox, who was off- world at the start of the conflict, arrived with Thanagarian warships and stopped the fighting without bloodshed on either side. The tension between the Rannians and the Tamaraneans was resolved by allowing the Tamaraneans to live on Rann's uninhabited southern continent. Although her relationship with Comet was only physical for her, Comet thought different thus ending their relationship. She also assisted the Green Lantern Corp in battling Psions. Starfire helped create an alliance between Rannians, Tamaraneans and L.E.G.I.O.N. after defeating Starro the Conqueror, ensuring security for Rann, the Vega System and the galaxy.Justice League of America (vol. 2) #43 (March 2010) Red Hood and the Outlaws Starfire in The New 52: Red Hood and the Outlaws #1 In 2011, DC Comics cancelled all of their monthly titles and rebooted the DC Universe continuity with 52 new titles in an initiative dubbed The New 52. As part of the relaunch, Starfire became the cast member of the series Red Hood and the Outlaws. In the new continuity, the character appears to have a similar origin, though she is now a member of that titular group, in which Jason Todd (Red Hood) and Roy Harper (Arsenal) are her teammates. As in the previous continuity, she has a past relationship with Dick Grayson. One significant change to her backstory is that she was sold into slavery by her sister to save Tamaran from the Citadel. Another is that her ship, which crashed on a tropical island, appears to be her primary home, where she keeps a number of articles of Dick Grayson's clothing - which eventually serve to become part of Jason's \\"Red Hood\\" uniform.Red Hood and the Outlaws Vol. 1 #6. DC Comics Aliens of all sorts, but especially Tamaraneans, are hunted after on Earth as a man called Crux finds a picture of her, then attacks her and attempts to drain her powers away.Red Hood and the Outlaws Vol. 1 #4. DC Comics After she is attacked by Crux, it is revealed she was experimented on to some measure by The Citadel, which allowed her to retain her power through unconventional means after being hit with technology designed to drain her powers.Red Hood and the Outlaws Vol. 1 #5. DC Comics Starfire, at first, seemingly no longer remembers the Teen Titans when asked about them. However, it's later shown that she does retain her memories and recalls Dick Grayson and Roy's full name. Her sexual desires are brought up very casually when she offhandedly offers Harper a chance to sleep with her. Kory tells Jason and Roy that Tamaraneans are said to have a short attention span when it comes to \\"all things Earth\\", seeing humans as little more than sensory experiences. Later, it is shown that Koriand'r lied about her species' characteristics for personal reasons, and that her race in fact processes romantic feelings very deeply. In a flashback, Jason reveals that Koriand'r is the one who found him and nursed him back to health on the island she has made her home (after her ship crashed on it). The two attempted a romantic relationship, but Jason later notes that \\"[they] just friend-zoned each other\\". However, he considers her a dear friend, and narrates that if he ever gets used to Koriand'r kissing him, to shoot him. It's soon revealed that Koriand'r is Commander of a Spaceship named Starfire, the crew consisting of slaves she helped free when she herself escaped slavery. The Starfire has returned to earth for Kory because that Tamaran has been taken over by The Blight, a parasitic alien race.Red Hood and the Outlaws Vol.1 #10 Starfire talks to Roy and Jason in private and explains that she and Komand'r, her sister, were always not on the best of terms, though they tried. This is mainly because Kory blames her sister and the people of Tamaran for her enslavement, so she is torn on if she should help them now. Roy is then kidnapped during an attack on the ship and taken to Tamaran, driving Star to go to her home planet.Red Hood and the Outlaws Vol.1 #11 Eventually, Starfire decides she cannot leave her people and her sister helpless, so after they rescue Roy, the Outlaws and the crew of the Starfire help Blackfire take back Tamaran, and Kori reconciles with her sister. Later on, Kory's memories are forcefully returned, which leads Roy Harper to discover that she lied about her nonchalance towards relationships. Roy breaks up with her because of his own trust issues (particularly towards Oliver Queen), but the two reconcile later on, resulting in a much more tender relationship, since Kory is able to be emotive as she normally is, and no longer has to hide her emotions. Roy openly admits to Jason several times that he loves her, and later on, the pair confess their love to one another. Right at the end of the series, Tamaran is invaded again by Helspont, and, to ensure the safety of her people, Blackfire sides with him on the condition that Tamaran be spared. Koriand'r is devastated, but eventually, however, Blackfire hears her sister's pleas and betrays Helspont, destroying him and nearly killing herself in the process. This leads Kory and Roy to break up - though purely out of necessity - as Koriand'r is forced to return to Tamaran, so that Blackfire can get the medical attention she needs. The two share a kiss, and Koriand'r promises to remember Roy for \\"forever and a day\\". After Starfire departs, Roy announces to Jason that he, too, will now go his separate way, too, thus leaving Jason on his own. Rose Wilson, who was hired to kill Koriand'r (but eventually decided not to when she realised she was hired by Helspont), asks if Jason needs a minute after losing his team. He replies that they were not a team, they were friends. Starfire In 2015, Koriand'r was given a new solo on going series titled Starfire, wherein she returns to Earth (presumably by this point her sister is healed) - specifically, to Key West, a city (and island) in Florida. She befriends the local Sheriff, Stella Gomez, and a super-powered woman whose civilization lives inside the Earth's surface, called Atlee. As of issue #5, she has also befriended Stella's widowed brother, Sol (who bears a striking resemblance to Dick Grayson), and appears to not be particularly interested in heroism. DC Rebirth In DC's new status quo, DC Rebirth, Starfire is in the Teen Titans book, recruited by Damian Wayne to be a part of his new Teen Titans. After Damian crosses a line by kicking Wally West off the team, Starfire is chosen as the new leader of the Teen Titans. Starfire eventually joins the Justice League Odyssey consisting of herself, Cyborg, Green Lantern (Jessica Cruz), Azrael & Darkseid. She is later converted against her will to join Darkseid before being seemingly killed by her sister Blackfire, who believes that she will be brought back to life by Epoch. Powers and abilities Starfire is a Tamaranean and as such her physiology is designed to constantly absorb ultraviolet radiation. The radiation is then converted to pure energy, allowing her to fly at supersonic speeds. Originally, Starfire was capable of using this power to fly in space and even go fast enough to cross several solar systems in minutes to seconds. However, it is established in Red Hood and the Outlaws #2 and #27 that the rebooted Starfire is unable to fly without the effects of gravity, leaving her unable to travel in space unaided. This energy also gives her incredible superhuman strength and durability. This strength, combined with her fighting skills, allowed her to defeat the powerful Donna Troy about two out of three times during purely hand to hand matches. She later proved strong enough to fight against Wonder Woman for a certain period of time and, during a fit of rage, was so strong that Donna Troy was unable to contain her without the help of Mon-El, in the 2003 TV series, she was strong enough to easily throw vehicles and destroy entire streets with her blows. After being experimented on by the alien Psions, Starfire gained the ability to release her absorbed energy into incredibly powerful blasts called \\"starbolts.\\" As shown in the \\"Insiders\\" crossover story arc (Teen Titans and Outsiders), Starfire can also release nearly all of her stored energy as a powerful Omni-directional explosive burst, many times stronger and more powerful than her standard blasts. The released energy leaves her in a weakened state.Outsiders vol. 3 #32 (Mar 2006) She's also shown that she can consciously absorb ambient Ultraviolet and Solar Energy in order to weaken a Kryptonian's physical abilities.Superman Vol 1 #683 (Feb 2009) Starfire also demonstrated more control over her powers in the New 52 reboot, having used her internal energy to melt the metal of Jason Todd's gun when it came into contact with her skin. Starfire, and all Tamaraneans, are capable of assimilating languages through physical contact with another person. When Starfire attempts to do so with a male, she typically does so by kissing because it is \\"more fun\\" for her. Starfire is also proficient in hand- to-hand combat, having been trained by the Warlords of Okaara. She also doesn't need to eat, drink, sleep and doesn't require an atmosphere to breathe, though she has to if she is low on ultraviolet energy. Other versions * In Amalgam Comics, Starfire (Kory) was combined with Shatterstar from Marvel Comics to create Shatterstarfire.X-Patrol #1 (April 1996) * In the alternate timeline of the Flashpoint event, Starfire joins with the Amazons' Furies. She intends to burn the city to the ground.Flashpoint: Deadman and the Flying Graysons #2 (July 2011) Starfire then goes after circus members Dick Grayson and Boston Brand for Doctor Fate's Helm of Nabu. Starfire and the Amazons with her are killed in a gasoline explosion caused by Dick.Flashpoint: Deadman and the Flying Graysons #3 (August 2011) * In Kingdom Come universe, Kory married Dick and they had a daughter named Mar'i Grayson. At some point she dies, putting a strain on Dick and Mar'i's relationship. Mar'i was inspired by her parents to become the superheroine Nightstar. * In the Superman/Batman Mash-Up universe, Star Canary is an amalgamation of Starfire and Black Canary.Superman/Batman #60 & 60 (July and August 2009) * In the comic tie-in to Injustice: Gods Among Us, Starfire and the Titans are devastated when the nuclear explosion caused by the Joker kills Beast Boy and Kid Flash. She still harbors a romantic interest for Dick Grayson (who recently left the team to join the Justice League) in this reality. Despite Dick's warnings, she and the other Titans arrive at the Fortress of Solitude to help Superboy stop Superman. Superman mortally wounds Superboy and sends the rest of the Titans into the Phantom Zone to not only save Conner's life, but to also make sure they don't interfere with his plans. In the prequel to Injustice 2, she and the rest of the Titans are rescued from the Phantom Zone by the Insurgency. * In Teen Titans Go! #46 (a comic book spin-off from the TV series), it is revealed that Starfire has a younger brother named Wildfire. When the Gordanians had attacked Tamaran, her parents set up a ship to save him by launching him to another planet, thus saving the Tamaranean royal family bloodline. Afterwards, Blackfire, in an attempt to make a treaty between the Tamaranians and Gordanians, gives them Starfire as a slave (setting up her appearance in the episode \\"Go!\\"). As a result of Starfire and Wildfire's absence, their parents had tragically died of a broken heart. Wildfire seemingly comes to Earth to meet up with his second eldest sister, but he is revealed to be the shapeshifting Madame Rouge, who was aided in the deception by Blackfire. Discovering this, a furious and heartbroken Starfire closes off all sisterly ties with Blackfire (stating that they are no longer sisters), and vows that she will find her long-lost younger brother, as he is the only family she has left. * In Teen Titans: Earth One, Starfire appears as the source of power for Cyborg, Changeling, Kole, Terra, Jericho, Tempest, and Impulse. Several years ago, Starfire escaped her war torn world and landed on Earth, only to be kidnapped by STAR Labs and Niles Caulder in a bid to overthrow the USA government by implanting her alien DNA into humans via Project Titans. The children used in this experiment all developed their powers when Starfire went through puberty. Among the experiments used by STAR labs was a failed clone named after her evil older sister. * In Nightwing: The New Order, Nightwing ends an ongoing feud between superpowered beings by activating a device that depowers ninety percent of the super powered population, including Starfire. This builds to a future where super powers are outlawed and any super powered being must take inhibitor medications or be contained and studied should the medications not work on them. Prior to this, Dick and Kory were married and have a son named Jake (who soon develops Starfire's powers). After Dick joins the Crusaders and starts policing the metahuman community, Kory leaves her family and joins the Titans to fight against the anti-metahuman government. When Dick and Jake join with the Titans to restore the metahuman population's superpowers, Jake acts cold towards his mother for the effect her absence left on him and his father. After Jake restores the metahuman population's powers, Dick and Kory remained friends and Kory made more of an effort to be there for her son.Nightwing: The New Order(2017) Reception Starfire placed 21st on IGN's 2013 list of the \\"Top 25 Heroes of DC Comics\\". She was also ranked 20th in Comics Buyer's Guides \\"100 Sexiest Women in Comics\\" list. In other media Starfire as she appeared in the original Teen Titans animated series (2003-2006) Anna Diop as Kory Anders/Starfire in Titans Television =Animation= * Starfire appears in the Teen Titans animated series. This version of the character does not use contractions in her speech, has a limited grasp of Earth culture, and tends to misstate or misunderstand common idioms. She also has secret romantic feelings for Robin throughout the whole series until the movie Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo where she and Robin finally accepted their romantic feelings and became a romantic couple. * Starfire appears in the New Teen Titans shorts. In one short, she kisses a Spanish boy to learn Spanish, just like how she kissed a Japanese boy to learn Japanese in Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo. This causes Robin to be jealous and learn French to impress her. When he shows her his amazing French skills, she kisses him on the lips. * Starfire appears in Teen Titans Go!. However, unlike her previous incarnation in the 2003 series, Starfire does not reciprocate Robin's romantic feelings towards her out of obliviousness. Rather, she sees him as a brother figure or friend; however, in \\"Mouth Hole\\" and \\"The Return of Slade\\" it is predicted that they kissed. In this version, Starfire is shown as less mature, intelligent and collected. Her rage and fury releases a huge barrage of circular, bright green ultraviolet energy bolts that cause quite a lot of damage and pain to her enemies. Her hair is colored hot pink in this comedic version and not auburn, as it was in the original show. * Starfire appears as a non-voiced cameo in a DC Super Friends short. * Starfire appears as a recurring character in DC Super Hero Girls at Super Hero High School. Her appearance is modeled after her original look, with her auburn hair straight as opposed to curly. She does retain her unusual speech pattern of the English language from the other animated shows. * Starfire appears in \\"#TweenTitans,\\" an episode of the 2019 series DC Super Hero Girls, as a young child with long, braided pigtails similar to Pippi Longstocking. If she eats anything containing sugar, her powers go haywire and release a massive energy blast. Hynden Walch voices Starfire in all but the last of these appearances, in which the character is voiced by Grey DeLisle. =Live-action= * Starfire appears as a main character in the DC Universe series Titans, portrayed by Anna Diop. In the series, Kory Anders awakens after a car crash with no memory of her past. She learns that she has superhuman strength and can project bright, hot flames‚Äîpowered by the sun‚Äîfrom her hands. Kory joins forces with Dick Grayson and Gar Logan to protect the empathic Rachel Roth from those who pursue her. She eventually discovers that her real identity is Koriand'r, an alien princess sent to Earth to kill Rachel, so as to prevent the release of her demon father and thus avert the imminent annihilation of her home world at his hands. Instead, she decides to stay on Earth in order to help Rachel learn to control her powers as part of Dick's new incarnation of the Titans, while also building a life for herself as Kory Anders and dealing with her cruel older sister, who intends to destroy her out of petty jealousy. Films * Starfire appears in the Teen Titans animated series adaptation film Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo, with Hynden Walch reprising her previous role from the animated series. In the film, more focus is put on Robin and Starfire's blooming romance, culminating with the two sharing a romantic kiss after Brushogun is defeated and at the end they become a couple, as evident of them holding hands. * Starfire appears in Superman/Batman: Public Enemies as part of Lex Luthor's force of government-employed superheroes. Although Jennifer Hale receives voice credit, Starfire does not have any lines, the only thing she actually \\"says\\" are the vocal effects she makes when Superman punches her. Her appearance in this film is much like her comic counterpart, aside from her starbolts that are green instead of pink. * Starfire has a very brief cameo in Batman vs. Robin appearing as a still image on Dick Grayson's phone, although the image is obscured due to an incoming call notification from Alfred. Kory calls Dick while he's babysitting Damian and tells Dick what she's wearing. Dick tries to make arrangements to spend time with her before discovering Damian escaped and Batman needed help. Her voice is never heard. * Starfire makes another cameo in Batman: Bad Blood, this time voiced by Kari Wahlgren. She and Dick had plans for a date at Titans Tower but it was cancelled by Dick after a fight with Blockbuster and an emergency call from Alfred. Her image on Dick Grayson's phone is once again obscured by an incoming call notification from Alfred, although more of the picture can be seen this time; she can be confirmed to have solid green eyes and red hair. * Starfire appears in the animated film Justice League vs. Teen Titans, with Kari Wahlgren reprising her role. She is revealed to be the oldest and most mature member of the Titans as well as the leader after departure of the original leader Robin, now Nightwing whom she was seen talking to about Damian's issues. Her costume and hairstyle largely correspond to her original comic version. * Starfire appears in LEGO DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League - Gotham City Breakout, with Hynden Walch reprising her role.

She fights Dark Opal's shadow monsters before the ceremony for the Hero of the Year. * Starfire appears in the animated film Teen Titans: The Judas Contract, with Kari Wahlgren reprising her role. A flashback scene (taking place five years prior) shows that her origin matches her TV series version in which the original Teen Titans (which had consisted of Robin, Speedy, Kid Flash, Beast Boy and Bumblebee) rescued her from the Gordanians and she learned the English language by kissing Robin. In the present, she accepts Dick's offer to share an apartment. Though she is unsure of her role as leader, Dick reassures he chose her as the team's leader and his girlfriend for a reason. Like the previous movie, she seems incapable of emitting her bright green-colored ultraviolet energy from her eyes. * Starfire appears as a main focal character in DC Super Hero Girls: Intergalactic Games. As one of the competing heroes for Superhero High, she ends up fighting against her own elder sister for the championship. When later Blackfire changes sides, she combines her bright green starbolt energies with Blackfire's lilac ones; where they easily decimated them in one swoop, as she pointed out that were at their strongest using \\"the blast of togetherness\\". * A waitress wearing an exotic version of Starfire's costume (based on her first New 52 appearance) makes a cameo in Batman and Harley Quinn. * Starfire is one of the main characters in the 2018 animated theatrical film Teen Titans Go! To the Movies, again voiced by Hynden Walch. * The Teen Titans Go! and original Teen Titans animated series versions of Starfire appear in Teen Titans Go! vs. Teen Titans, with Hynden Walch reprising the role for both.

He first appears in the series at the start of the second novel, The Subtle Knife, and continues through to the final book, The Amber Spyglass. Introduced as a 12-year-old boy, he meets and befriends Lyra in the world of Citt√†gazze and teams up with her in order to uncover the mysteries of Dust and the disappearance of his father many years previously. He takes possession of the Subtle Knife which he uses to aid Lord Asriel in his bid to destroy the Authority. Description Will is the only son of John Parry, an explorer, and of Elaine Parry, a woman who suffers from mental health problems, and whom he has taken care of since he was young, due to her condition. Will is unable to remember his father, a former Royal Marine, who has not been heard of since he vanished on an expedition to the Arctic when Will was only a baby, and who we later learn has wandered into another world and is unable to find his way back. Will lives in Winchester with his mother and their cat, Moxie. Will is described as having straight black eyebrows, dark hair with a strong, jutting jaw.The Subtle Knife pp.2. Philip Pullman (1998). . He is quite stocky and has a muscular build (for his age) and dark, fierce eyes into which most characters in the trilogy avoid looking directly. Although he is supposed to have dark hair, he can be seen on the cover of the US edition with fair, brown hair, and in the Spanish edition with reddish hair. Unlike Lyra, Will is quiet, serious and courteous, he has a strong sense of morality (even paying for food and clothes taken from the empty city of Citt√†gazze) and is very assertive, always standing up for himself and his friends and refusing to be spoken down to. He demonstrates great bravery several times in the novels, though he dislikes fighting, and other characters often find him fierce and intimidating. Will is exceptionally independent for a child of his age, and is able to look after himself. D√¶mon During Will's journey into the Land of the Dead in The Amber Spyglass, he is forced to separate from part of his soul. This turns out to be his d√¶mon, who had previously lived unseen inside him. As Will is still a child when this happens, his d√¶mon had not yet settled into one particular form. However, towards the end of the novel, his d√¶mon is touched (described as a very intimate and usually forbidden action) by Lyra and she settles as a large cat with lustrous and subtle-coloured fur. She is named Kirjava by the witch Serafina Pekkala (Kirjava means mottled in Finnish) Unusually, Kirjava has the ability to move far away from Will, much farther than d√¶mons normally can from their humans. It is this power that allows her and Pantalaimon to run away from Will and Lyra, having been rescued, in order to punish the children for abandoning them when they entered the Land of the Dead. During their absence, they travel through many worlds and though they return and reconcile with their humans, they agree to keep what they did and saw a secret until they feel the time is right to tell their humans. Role The Subtle Knife At the beginning of The Subtle Knife, Will is trying to discover the truth behind his father's disappearance and searches his house for a box of his mother's letters, which may contain a clue to his whereabouts. However, he is disturbed early in the morning by a group of government agents breaking into his house who are also searching for the same thing. Having found the letters, he flees but accidentally kills one of the men while doing so. He heads to Oxford so that he can talk to his father's lawyer and while looking for somewhere to sleep that night, he discovers an interdimensional window leading to the world of Citt√†gazze. He explores the mysterious city and finds it completely empty of people ‚Äì except for a girl about his own age called Lyra, who seems at first to be selfish and haughty. Will questions Lyra and soon realises that she is also from another world, one that is very different from his own. When Lyra learns that Will's world also has an Oxford in it, she decides to go there and speak to the physicists about Dust. Will returns there with her the next day but is unable to learn much more about his father from either his solicitor or the local library. Upon reading his mother's letters, however, he discovers that his father disappeared when he was just a year old while exploring an ‚Äòanomaly‚Äô on an expedition in Alaska ‚Äì this turns out to be a window to Citt√†gazze, exactly like the one Will discovered himself. Shortly afterwards, Lyra's alethiometer, (her truth-telling device) is stolen by Sir Charles Latrom in Oxford. Will goes back and confronts Sir Charles but is told he will only return the alethiometer in exchange for the Subtle Knife, located in the Torre degli Angeli, a stone tower in Citt√†gazze. Sir Charles is unable to retrieve the knife himself due to the Spectres which infest Citt√†gazze and feed on the consciousness of adults. Will and Lyra search the tower but are attacked by another man, an inhabitant of Citt√†gazze, who wants the knife for himself. Together they overcome the assailant and win the knife but Will is badly wounded ‚Äì the little and ring fingers of his left hand are cut off. Meeting the knife's original owner, he reveals to them that Will's injuries are the 'mark' of the subtle knife, which indicate that the knife must pass from him to Will, prompting him to spend some time instructing Will in the use of the knife before he encourages them to leave, intending to commit suicide so that the spectres cannot consume him. As well as being able to cut through to other worlds, the Subtle Knife is also able to cut through any material or object in any of the worlds. Armed with it, Will and Lyra return to Sir Charles‚Äô house and steal back the alethiometer, narrowly evading Sir Charles and his guest, Marisa Coulter. However, the very next morning they are attacked by a group of Citt√†gazze children who are furious at them for stealing the knife, led by the younger brother and sister of the man who tried to take it for himself. They flee from the city and are rescued by a group of witches from Lyra's world, led by Serafina Pekkala. Lyra and Will, now escorted by the witches, continue their search for Will's father but are unknowingly being followed by Mrs Coulter and a troop of Spectres. One night, Will, unable to sleep, walks to the summit of the mountain they had been traversing where he encounters a mysterious man. The man realises that Will is the bearer of the Subtle Knife and instructs him to take it to Lord Asriel. However, just as Will recognises that the man is his father, the man is killed by a witch, bitter that he had once rejected her. Will captures the witch and berates her but she kills herself. He then returns to the camp, only to find that the witches have been attacked by Spectres and that Lyra has been captured. Two angels named Baruch and Balthamos, who had been following Will's father, appear to him, urging him to follow them to Lord Asriel. The Amber Spyglass With Lyra missing, Will refuses to take the Subtle Knife to Lord Asriel until he finds her. Baruch and Balthamos reluctantly agree and with their help, Will tracks her down to a cave in the Himalayas, back in her own world. Along the way he meets Lyra's old friend Iorek Byrnison, who is looking to migrate south due to the melting of the Arctic ice, and together they locate Lyra's cave where she is being kept in a drugged sleep by Mrs Coulter. Will infiltrates the cave using the knife, but just as he prepares to pull Lyra out, the presence of Mrs Coulter reminds him of his sick mother and his concentration slips, causing the Subtle Knife to shatter. He collects the pieces and they manage to escape when Mrs Coulter is attacked by two of Lord Asriel's Gallivespian spies. The four of them make it safely to a window Will had opened previously and move into another world. Lyra then tells Will about a dream she had during her long sleep in which she talked to her old friend Roger (whom she accidentally led to his death at the end of Northern Lights), whose soul is now trapped in the World of the Dead. Will agrees to go there with her to try and save him, if he can get Iorek to fix the knife. Will finds Iorek the next day and Iorek reluctantly agrees to help him mend the knife. With the knife repaired, Will and Lyra cut their way into the World of the Dead. However, as they approach the island where the souls of the deceased are imprisoned, they realise they must leave behind their d√¶mons if they are to enter. Will's d√¶mon, who lives inside him, is torn away, causing him terrible pain. Lyra finds Roger's ghost and apologises before Will cuts a window back out to the world, allowing the billions of souls to be released. However, from his father's ghost, Will learns that his and Lyras‚Äô d√¶mons are now in the world where Lord Asriel is waging war on the Authority. They cut back there and escape with the d√¶mons to another world, narrowly avoiding the attentions of the Spectres they are now vulnerable to. However, when they wake up the next morning, the d√¶mons have fled from them. A group of highly developed animals approach them and carry them back to their village where Lyra's friend Mary Malone, a physicist from Will's world, is waiting among the Mulefa. They tell her about their adventures and in return Mary tells them about the time she first fell in love and how she stopped believing in God (she had previously been a nun). Will goes back out the next morning with Lyra to find their d√¶mons. When they stop to eat, Lyra feeds him a piece of fruit that was given to them by Mary (a reference to the Fall), and they realise that they have fallen in love with each other. Their love causes Dust, which is the source of human consciousness and free will, to stop escaping but instead to fall upon the world once more. However, the very next day their d√¶mons return and tell them what they have learned. To preserve the existence of Dust, all of the windows between the worlds must be closed, and because d√¶mons can only live for a short time outside of their own worlds, Will and Lyra must each return to their own world. Will is also told that using the Subtle Knife had produced the Spectres initially and that it must therefore be destroyed: he can no longer use it to travel between worlds. Will realises that he and Lyra must separate forever. Will, Lyra and Mary return to Citt√†gazze and he cuts a window back into the Oxford of his world. Before they part, Lyra leads him to the University's Botanic Garden where she finds a certain bench, one that also exists in her world in the same place. They promise to return there, every year for the rest of their lives at noon on midsummer's day so they can feel close to one another again. Lyra steps back into Citt√†gazze and Will seals the window behind her. Finally Will has to break the knife and he recalls how it had broken the first time, when he had thought of his mother. This time he thinks of Lyra and the knife shatters, as it is unable to cut through his love for her. He collects the pieces and leaves with Mary as the two discuss how to cover up their absence and best help his mother. After the books In the 2013 edition of The Amber Spyglass released in the UK, the post-script Lantern Slides section reveals that Will later becomes a medical student and eventually a doctor in his world. His time bearing the Subtle Knife has given him the gift of diagnosing patients, though he tries to hide this gift early in his studies as others would believe it to be supernatural. Adaptations In the unabridged audio books, Will's role is read by Steven Webb in The Subtle Knife and by Peter England in The Amber Spyglass, while in the BBC's dramatisation he was played by Daniel Anthony. In the National Theatre's production of His Dark Materials in 2003, Will was portrayed by Dominic Cooper. In the BBC adaptation of His Dark Materials, he is portrayed by Amir Wilson.

The Battle of Preston (9‚Äì14 November 1715), also referred to as the Preston Fight, was fought during the Jacobite Rising of 1715 (often referred to as the First Jacobite Rising, or Rebellion by supporters of the Hanoverian government). Background The Jacobites moved south into England with little opposition, and by the time they reached Preston in Lancashire had grown to about 4,000 in number. Their horse troops entered Preston on the night of 9 November 1715, and as they approached two troops of dragoons and part of a militia regiment retreated to Wigan. General Charles Wills was ordered to halt their advance, and left Manchester on 11 November with six regiments, arriving on the 12th. The Jacobite leader Thomas Forster, a Northumberland squire, had intended to move on that day, but, learning of Wills's approach, decided to stay and made the mistake of withdrawing troops from a strong defensive position at Ribble bridge, outside Preston. Battle The Jacobites had barricaded the principal streets of Preston, and Wills ordered an immediate attack, which met with fire from the barricades and from houses, resulting in the Hanoverian attack being repulsed with heavy losses. Wills then had houses set on fire, with the aim of fires spreading along to the Jacobite positions, and the Jacobites tried to do the same to houses taken as government positions. At night, Wills's order to light the government-held positions for identification helped the Jacobite snipers, but overnight many Jacobites left the town. The legend of these actions is recounted in a well-known Lancashire ballad, Lo! The Bird is Fallen. On the morning of Sunday 13 November more government forces arrived and, finding that the town was insufficiently encircled, Wills stationed more troops to prevent the besieged Jacobite army from escaping. The Jacobites had also suffered losses in the fighting, as well as losing defectors overnight, and although the Highlanders' full intention was to fight on and take the attack to the enemy, Forster agreed to an offer from his officer Colonel Oxburgh to open negotiations with Wills for capitulation on favourable terms. This was done without informing the Highlanders, but Wills refused to treat with rebels. When the Highlanders learned of this that night, they were infuriated and paraded the streets threatening any Jacobites who might even allude to a surrender, killing or wounding several people. At seven o'clock on the morning of Monday 14 November, Forster offered an unconditional surrender, which was turned down unless it applied to the Highlanders. Forster then sent back confirmation that the Scots noblemen would surrender on the same terms. When the government forces entered the town, the Highlanders were drawn up under arms in the market-place ready to surrender. Aftermath 1,468 Jacobites were taken prisoner, 463 of them English. George Seton, 5th Earl of Winton, William Gordon, 6th Viscount of Kenmure, William Maxwell, 5th Earl of Nithsdale, James Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Derwentwater, and William Murray, 2nd Lord Nairne, were among those captured and later sentenced to be executed for treason under an act of attainder. However, Winton and Nithsdale escaped from the Tower of London. In May 1716 Colonel Henry Oxburgh was hung, drawn and quartered at Tyburn for his part in the rising. All surviving prisoners except for members of the Clan Gregor were later pardoned by the Indemnity Act 1717. Seventeen Jacobites were killed and twenty-five wounded. Government casualties were close to 300 killed and wounded.The best discussion of this is by the historian and military expert J. Baynes in his The Jacobite Rising of 1715 (1970), pp. 126‚Äì127. Of the ordinary Highland clansmen captured at the Battle of Preston, many were transported to the Americas.Mackintosh at myclan.com Last battle on English soil The battle of Preston is often claimed to have been the last fought on English soil, but this depends on the definition of \\"battle\\", for which there are different interpretations. Preston was a siege rather than a pitched battle, so the Battle of Sedgemoor fought in 1685 is also a contender for the title of the last battle, as is the skirmish at Clifton Moor near Penrith in Cumbria on 18 December 1745 during the 'Forty- Five' Jacobite rebellion. However, there was a great deal of savage fighting in streets all over the town during the Battle of Preston, far more than in most sieges. It was as much of a battle as, for example, the Battle of St Albans (1455) in the Wars of the Roses, which was also fought in the streets of a town, but which is generally regarded as a battle and not a siege, as is the Battle of Reading of 1688. The Battle of Bossenden Wood, fought on 31 May 1838, is a much later contender.

See for example Joukowsky transform, Kutta‚ÄìJoukowski theorem and so on. (; ‚Äì March 17, 1921) was a Russian scientist, mathematician and engineer, and a founding father of modern aero- and hydrodynamics. Whereas contemporary scientists scoffed at the idea of human flight, Zhukovsky was the first to undertake the study of airflow. He is often called the Father of Russian Aviation. The Joukowsky transform is named after him, while the fundamental aerodynamical theorem, the Kutta‚ÄìJoukowski theorem, is named after both him and German mathematician Martin Kutta. Life Zhukovsky was born in the village of Orekhovo, Vladimir Governorate, Russian Empire. In 1868, he graduated from Moscow University where he studied under August Davidov. From 1872, he was a professor at the Imperial Technical School. In 1904, he established the world's first Aerodynamic Institute in Kachino near Moscow. He was influenced by both Ernst Mach and his son Ludwig Mach. From 1918, he was the head of TsAGI (Central AeroHydroDynamics Institute). Collected paper Nikolay Zhukovsky. Theoretical basis aeronautics. Stamp from the USSR Aviation series 1963 dedicated to Zhukovsky (CFA 2915, Scott 2774) He was the first scientist to explain mathematically the origin of aerodynamic lift, through his circulation hypothesis, the first to establish that the lift force generated by a body moving through an ideal fluid is proportional to the velocity and the circulation around the body. He used a conformal mathematical transformation to define the ideal shape of the aerodynamic profile having as essential elements a rounded nose (leading edge), double surface (finite thickness), cambered or symmetrical, and a sharp tail (trailing edge). He built the first wind tunnel in Russia. He was also responsible for the eponymous water hammer equation used by civil engineers and the Joukowsky transform. He published a derivation for the maximum energy obtainable from a turbine in 1920, at the same time as German scientist Albert Betz.Gijs A.M. van Kuik, The Lanchester-Betz-Joukowsky Limit , Wind Energ. 2007; 10:289‚Äì291 This is known controversially as Betz's law, as this result was also derived by British scientist Frederick W. Lanchester. This is a famous example of Stigler's law of eponymy. He died in Moscow in 1921. Recognition A city near Moscow and the crater Zhukovskiy on the Moon are both named in his honor. The State Zhukovsky Prize was established in 1920 'for the best works in mathematics'. The Russian Air Force's engineering academy was named for him, later reorganized into the Zhukovsky ‚Äì Gagarin Air Force Academy. In May 2016, Moscow's fourth largest airport was named in his honor. Mosfilm produced a 1950 eponymous biopic directed by Vsevolod Pudovkin with music by Vissarion Shebalin, which earned Pudovkin and Shebalin the USSR State Prize in 1951.

Background As part of the Allied invasion of Sicily, the Seventh United States Army under Lieutenant General George S. Patton and the British Eighth Army under General Sir Bernard L. Montgomery invaded the southeast corner of the island on 10 July 1943. As part of Lieutenant General Omar N. Bradley's II Corps, the 45th Infantry Division was given a difficult task despite the fact that it was the only \\"green\\" division (i.e. had no previous combat experience) participating in the invasion. The 45th Division's 157th and 179th Infantry Regiments were given the task of capturing several coastal towns and the Comiso Airport before linking up with the 1st Canadian Infantry Division. The 180th Infantry Regiment was given the task of capturing the Biscari airfield and linking up the US 1st Infantry Division.Atkinson, (2007), pp. 37‚Äì8. The 180th Infantry Regiment performed so poorly in the first 48 hours of the landing that Major General Troy Middleton considered relieving its commander. Instead, the assistant division commander was sent to exercise close supervision over the regiment. During the capture of the Biscari airfield on 14 July 1943, troops of the 180th Infantry killed a total of 71 Italian and two German POWs in two separate incidents. In the first incident 35 Italians and two Germans were killed, while 36 Italians were killed in the second incident.Weingartner (November 1989), pp. 24-39.Robbins (2000), pp274-6.Borch (2013), pp. 1‚Äì6. West incident On 14 July 1943, soldiers with the U.S. 180th Infantry Regiment were facing stiff enemy resistance near the Santo Pietro airfield, and by 10:00 hours had taken a number of prisoners, including 45 Italians and 3 Germans. The executive officer for the 1st Battalion, 180th Infantry Regiment, Major Roger Denman, ordered a noncommissioned officer (NCO), Sergeant Horace T. West, 33 years old, to take that group of prisoners \\"to the rear, off the road, where they would not be conspicuous, and hold them for questioning.\\" The POWs were without shoes and shirts, which was common practice to discourage attempts to escape.Borch, (2013), p.1 After Sergeant West, with several other U.S. soldiers assisting him, had marched the POWs about a mile, he halted the group and directed that eight or nine of them be separated from the rest and taken to the regimental intelligence officer (the S-2) for questioning. West then took the remaining POWs \\"off the road, lined them up, and borrowed a Thompson submachine gun\\" from the Company First Sergeant (the senior NCO in the Company). When the First Sergeant asked West what he wanted it for, West responded that he was going to \\"kill the sons of bitches.\\" West then told the soldiers guarding the POWs to \\"turn around if you don't want to see it.\\"Borch, (2013), p.1 He then killed the POWs by shooting them with the Thompson. When the bodies were discovered some thirty minutes later, it was noted that each POW had been shot through the heart, which indicated shooting at close range. Investigators later learned that after West had emptied the Thompson into the group of POWs, he \\"stopped to reload, then walked among the men in their pooling blood and fired a single round into the hearts of those still moving.\\"Borch, (2013), pp.1‚Äì2; Atkinson (2007) p.118 The next day, the 37 bodies caught the attention of a chaplain, Lt. Col. William E. King, who reported the event to his senior officers, who at first dismissed it because of the bad press if it were to go public, but after some convincing they agreed to go to court for murder.Mikaberidze (2013), pp. 66‚Äì67. Compton incident As commander of C Company, 1st Battalion, 180th Infantry Regiment, Captain John T. Compton landed south of the Acate River amidst sporadic mortar and small arms fire. Pursuing his first objective, he pushed his company towards Highway 115, joined with some 82nd Airborne Division paratroopers, and attacked several German positions. Compton did not sleep during the first three days of the invasion. He was simply \\"too excited to sleep.\\" On the fourth day, he managed to grab about an hour and a half of sleep before the attack on the Biscari airfield. Around 23:00, C Company set off and reached the airfield around 11:00 on 14 July 1943. Immediately they began to receive artillery, mortar, and sniper fire. The sniper fire was especially deadly. From a concealed position in a nearby draw, the snipers targeted wounded G.I.s as well as the medics attempting to aid them. Out of 34 men in Compton's 2nd Platoon, 12 were either wounded in action (WIA) or killed in action (KIA).U.S. Department of the Army, Compton testimony, Trial Proper, Compton Court-Martial, 60-62. In an attempt to locate the snipers' firing position, Private Raymond C. Marlow crept down into a nearby draw. He had only gone about 25 yards into the draw before he spotted an Italian soldier with a rifle. Marlow raised his rifle and shouted at the Italian. The Italian ran away and entered a dugout that was located further in the draw. After a minute or two, the Italian soldier emerged with thirty-five others, several of whom were in civilian clothing. Marlow walked them up the hill to his outpost and reported to his squad leader, Sergeant Hair. \\"I told him that I had gotten those fellows that were shooting at us while we were getting out from under that artillery fire,\\" Marlow reported. Acting as an interpreter, Private John Gazzetti asked the prisoners if they had been acting as snipers. He got no response. Hair herded the prisoners out of the draw and asked 1st Lieutenant Blanks what he should do with them. Blanks, in turn, asked Compton for instructions. Compton asked Blanks if he was sure that they were the same snipers that had been shooting at them all day. When Blanks answered in the affirmative, Compton said bluntly, \\"Get them shot.\\" Without hesitation, Blanks ordered Hair to assemble a firing squad and shoot the prisoners.U.S. Department of the Army, Marlow, Hair, Gazzetti, and Blanks testimony, Trial Proper, Compton Court-Martial, 27-34, 15-6, 35, 7-9. Compton accompanied the firing squad of about 11 men to the ridge overlooking the draw.The exact number of men who participated in the firing squad is unclear, but statements made during the ensuing investigation revealed the involvement of Lt. Blanks, Sgt. Jim Hair, Sgt. Kern Jones, Sgt. Freeland Douglas, Sgt. Jack Wilson, Sgt. Julius Thompson, Pvt. John Carroll, Pvt. Raymond Marlow, Pvt. John Gazzetti, Pvt. Earl Barnett, and Pvt. Salcidu. U.S. Department of the Army, \\"Statement made by Pvt John Gazzetti, 32204829, Co. C, 180th Infantry,\\" and \\"Statement made by Sgt Jim Hair, 20828237, Co C, 180th Infantry,\\" Inspector General's Report, Compton Court-Martial. He told the G.I.s to line up and they positioned themselves about six feet away from the prisoners. The prisoners started pleading for them not to shoot. Gazzetti, the interpreter, asked Compton if he had anything to say to the prisoners. Compton did not have anything he wanted to ask them. Compton told the men to commence firing on his order and that he \\"didn't want a man left standing when the firing was done.\\" Seeing that their fate was sealed, a few of the prisoners began to run. The firing squad opened fire and killed all of the prisoners.U.S. Department of the Army, Gazetti and Compton Testimony, Trial Proper, Compton Court-Martial Aftermath When he was informed of the massacres, General Omar Bradley told General George Patton that US troops had murdered some 50-70 prisoners in cold blood. Patton noted his response in his diary: > I told Bradley that it was probably an exaggeration, but in any case to tell > the Officer to certify that the dead men were snipers or had attempted to > escape or something, as it would make a stink in the press and also would > make the civilians mad. Anyhow, they are dead, so nothing can be done about > it.Atkinson (2007), p. 119. Bradley refused Patton's suggestions. Patton later changed his mind. After he learned that the 45th Division's Inspector General found \\"no provocation on the part of the prisoners.... They had been slaughtered,\\" Patton is reported to have said, \\"Try the bastards.\\"Atkinson (2007) p.119. The U.S. Army charged Sergeant Horace T. West for \\"willfully, deliberately, feloniously, [and] unlawfully\\" killing 37 prisoners of war in the first incident.Borch (2013), p. 2. At his trial, which began on 2 September 1943, West pleaded not guilty. Although he admitted the killings, his non-lawyer defense counsel raised two matters in his defense. The first was he was \\"fatigued and under extreme emotional distress\\" at the time of the killings and was essentially temporarily insane at the time of the commission of the acts. However, First Sergeant Haskell Y. Brown testified that West had borrowed the Thompson and an additional magazine of 30 rounds and had appeared to act in cold blood.Borch (2013), p. 3. The second defense raised by West's counsel was that he was simply following the orders of his Commanding General, who he testified had announced prior to the invasion of Sicily that prisoners should be taken only under limited circumstances.Borch (2013), p. 3. West's regimental commander, Colonel Forrest E. Cookson, testified that the general had stated that if the enemy continued to resist after US troops had come within 200 yards of their defensive position, surrender of those enemy soldiers need not be accepted.Borch (2013), p. 3.; Weingartner (November 1989), p. 28 The problems with that defense were that the prisoners-of-war had already surrendered, and the surrender had been accepted. The court-martial panel found West guilty of premeditated murder, stripped him of his rank, and sentenced him to life imprisonment. He was detained in North Africa for fear that his presence in a federal penitentiary could bring unwanted publicity to him and to his crime.Borch (2013), p. 5. On reviewing West's record of trial, Eisenhower decided to \\"give the man a chance\\" after he had \\"served enough of his life sentence to demonstrate that he could be returned to active duty\\".Borch (2013), p. 5. After West's brother wrote to the Army and his local US representative, it was decided to \\"resolve the worrisome matter\\" and on the recommendation of the War Department's Bureau of Public Relations, the Deputy Commander of Allied Headquarters in Italy signed an order remitting West's sentence on 24 November 1944. He was restored to active duty and continued to serve during the war at the end of which he received an honorable discharge.Borch (2013), p. 5. West died in Oklahoma in January 1974. In regard to the second incident, Captain John T. Compton was also court-martialed and charged with the premeditated murder of 36 POWs under his charge. He also pleaded not guilty, and relying upon the respondeat superior legal doctrine, also defended his actions by claiming that he was merely following orders of his commanding general given in a speech to the officers in his division. On 23 October 1943 the court martial panel acquitted him, but the Judge Advocate's review of the trial declared that in his opinion, Compton's actions had been unlawful.Borch (2013), p. 4. Compton was transferred to the 179th Infantry Regiment and subsequently was killed in action on 8 November 1943 in Italy. The commanding general named by both West and Compton was Patton. The War Department Inspector General's office conducted an investigation into the killings, and in the course of the investigation General Patton was questioned about the alleged speech. Patton stated that his comments in the speech had been misinterpreted and nothing he had said \\"by the wildest stretch of the imagination\\" could have been taken as an order to murder POWs. The investigation ultimately cleared Patton of any wrongdoing.Borch (2013), p. 5.

Histopathology (compound of three Greek words: histos \\"tissue\\", œÄŒ¨Œ∏ŒøœÇ pathos \\"suffering\\", and -ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒØŒ± -logia \\"study of\\") refers to the microscopic examination of tissue in order to study the manifestations of disease. Specifically, in clinical medicine, histopathology refers to the examination of a biopsy or surgical specimen by a pathologist, after the specimen has been processed and histological sections have been placed onto glass slides. In contrast, cytopathology examines free cells or tissue micro-fragments (as \\"cell blocks\\").  Collection of tissues  Histopathological examination of tissues starts with surgery, biopsy, or autopsy. The tissue is removed from the body or plant, and then, often following expert dissection in the fresh state, placed in a fixative which stabilizes the tissues to prevent decay. The most common fixative is formalin (10% neutral buffered formaldehyde in water).  Preparation for histology  The tissue is then prepared for viewing under a microscope using either chemical fixation or frozen section. If a large sample is provided e.g. from a surgical procedure then a pathologist looks at the tissue sample and selects the part most likely to yield a useful and accurate diagnosis - this part is removed for examination in a process commonly known as grossing or cut up. Larger samples are cut to correctly situate their anatomical structures in the cassette. Certain specimens (especially biopsies) can undergo agar pre- embedding to assure correct tissue orientation in cassette & then in the block & then on the diagnostic microscopy slide. This is then placed into a plastic cassette for most of the rest of the process. Chemical fixation In addition to formalin, other chemical fixatives have been used. But, with the advent of immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining and diagnostic molecular pathology testing on these specimen samples, formalin has become the standard chemical fixative in human diagnostic histopathology. Fixation times for very small specimens are shorter, and standards exist in human diagnostic histopathology. Processing Water is removed from the sample in successive stages by the use of increasing concentrations of alcohol. Xylene is used in the last dehydration phase instead of alcohol - this is because the wax used in the next stage is soluble in xylene where it is not in alcohol allowing wax to permeate (infiltrate) the specimen. This process is generally automated and done overnight. The wax infiltrated specimen is then transferred to an individual specimen embedding (usually metal) container. Finally, molten wax is introduced around the specimen in the container and cooled to solidification so as to embed it in the wax block. This process is needed to provide a properly oriented sample sturdy enough for obtaining a thin microtome section(s) for the slide. Once the wax embedded block is finished, sections will be cut from it and usually placed to float on a waterbath surface which spreads the section out. This is usually done by hand and is a skilled job (histotechnologist) with the lab personnel making choices about which parts of the specimen microtome wax ribbon to place on slides. A number of slides will usually be prepared from different levels throughout the block. After this the thin section mounted slide is stained and a protective cover slip is mounted on it. For common stains, an automatic process is normally used; but rarely used stains are often done by hand.  Frozen section processing  The second method of histology processing is called frozen section processing. This is a highly technical scientific method performed by a trained histoscientist. In this method, the tissue is frozen and sliced thinly using a microtome mounted in a below-freezing refrigeration device called the cryostat. The thin frozen sections are mounted on a glass slide, fixed immediately & briefly in liquid fixative, and stained using the similar staining techniques as traditional wax embedded sections. The advantages of this method is rapid processing time, less equipment requirement, and less need for ventilation in the laboratory. The disadvantage is the poor quality of the final slide. It is used in intra-operative pathology for determinations that might help in choosing the next step in surgery during that surgical session (for example, to preliminarily determine clearness of the resection margin of a tumor during surgery).  Staining of processed histology slides  This can be done to slides processed by the chemical fixation or frozen section slides. To see the tissue under a microscope, the sections are stained with one or more pigments. The aim of staining is to reveal cellular components; counterstains are used to provide contrast. The most commonly used stain in histology is a combination of hematoxylin and eosin (often abbreviated H&E;). Hematoxylin is used to stain nuclei blue, while eosin stains cytoplasm and the extracellular connective tissue matrix pink. There are hundreds of various other techniques which have been used to selectively stain cells. Other compounds used to color tissue sections include safranin, Oil Red O, congo red, silver salts and artificial dyes. Histochemistry refers to the science of using chemical reactions between laboratory chemicals and components within tissue. A commonly performed histochemical technique is the Perls' Prussian blue reaction, used to demonstrate iron deposits in diseases like Hemochromatosis. Recently, antibodies have been used to stain particular proteins, lipids and carbohydrates. Called immunohistochemistry, this technique has greatly increased the ability to specifically identify categories of cells under a microscope. Other advanced techniques include in situ hybridization to identify specific DNA or RNA molecules. These antibody staining methods often require the use of frozen section histology. These procedures above are also carried out in the laboratory under scrutiny and precision by a trained specialist medical laboratory scientist (a histoscientist). Digital cameras are increasingly used to capture histopathological images.  Interpretation  The histological slides are examined under a microscope by a pathologist, a medically qualified specialist who has completed a recognised training program. This medical diagnosis is formulated as a pathology report describing the histological findings and the opinion of the pathologist. In the case of cancer, this represents the tissue diagnosis required for most treatment protocols. In the removal of cancer, the pathologist will indicate whether the surgical margin is cleared, or is involved (residual cancer is left behind). This is done using either the bread loafing or CCPDMA method of processing. Microscopic visual artifacts can potentially cause misdiagnosis of samples.  In myocardial infarction  After a myocardial infarction (heart attack), no histopathology is seen the first ~30 minutes. The only possible sign the first 4 hours is waviness of fibres at border. Later, however, a coagulation necrosis is initiated, with edema and hemorrhage. After 12 hours, there can be seen karyopyknosis and hypereosinophilia of myocytes with contraction band necrosis in margins, as well as beginning of neutrophil infiltration. At 1 ‚Äì 3 days there is continued coagulation necrosis with loss of nuclei and striations and an increased infiltration of neutrophils to interstitium. Until the end of the first week after infarction there is beginning of disintegration of dead muscle fibres, necrosis of neutrophils and beginning of macrophage removal of dead cells at border, which increases the succeeding days. After a week there is also beginning of granulation tissue formation at margins, which matures during the following month, and gets increased collagen deposition and decreased cellularity until the myocardial scarring is fully mature at approximately 2 months after infarction.Chapter 11 in: 8th edition.

Life Early years Former Senate House, University of London, 6 Burlington Gardens Pennethorne was born in Worcester, and travelled to London in 1820 to study architecture, first under Augustus Charles Pugin and then under John Nash. Pennethorne's father, Thomas was a first cousin of Nash's wife. In October 1824 he set off on a tour of France, Italy, and Sicily. At Rome he studied antiquities, and made a design for the restoration of the Forum, which he subsequently exhibited and was elected a member of the academy of St. Luke. On his return to London, at the end of 1826, he entered the office of John Nash, and, as his principal assistant, directed the West Strand, King William Street, and other important improvements, completing the Park Village East and Park Village West in Regent's Park after Nash's death. Until 1840 Pennethorne engaged in some private practice, his works including the Bazaar, in St. James's Street; Swithland Hall, Leicestershire; Dillington House, Ilminster; St. Julian's (a house at Sevenoaks); and Christ Church, Albany Street. During this time he also began the work for the government, which would come to dominate his career. In 1832 he was directly employed by the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Woods to prepare plans for further improvements in the capital. One of his aims was to form a great street running from the extreme east to the extreme west of London, but this proved too ambitious for the government. However four streets were constructed to modified versions of his plans: New Oxford Street, Endell Street, Cranbourn Street and Commercial Street. In 1846 an act was obtained for the extension of Commercial Street from Spitalfields Church to Shoreditch, but this was not completed until 1858. In 1855 the newly formed Metropolitan Board of Works constructed Garrick Street, Southwark Street, Old Street to Shoreditch, and other thoroughfares from Pennethorne's earlier designs. Public works After 1840 Pennethorne's time was wholly absorbed by his work for the government. In that year he was appointed (with Thomas Chawner) joint surveyor of houses in London, in the land revenue department; in 1843 he became sole surveyor and architect of the Office of Woods, and was appointed a commissioner to inquire into the construction of workhouses in Ireland. . The Museum of Practical Geology, which also housed the offices and laboratories of the Geological Survey was built to Pennethorne's designs in 1847-9, on a long, narrow site with frontages in Piccadilly and Jermyn Street. It opened in 1851. In 1847 he drew up designs for the Public Record Office in Fetter Lane. A much modified version of the scheme was adopted in 1850, though only portions of it were ever built. In 1848 he modified Nash's Quadrant in Regent Street, removing the colonnade and inserting a balcony and mezzanine story. In 1852 he worked on improvements to Buckingham Palace and the area between St. James's Park and the Royal Mews. His works at the palace included the ball-room, supper-room, and connecting galleries. To the south of the palace he erected the Duchy of Cornwall office, the district post office, and other buildings. Between 1852 and 1856 he completed the west wing of William Chambers' Somerset House. He was responsible for laying out Victoria Park in Tower Hamlets, Battersea Park, and prepared plans and estimates for a proposed \\"Albert Park\\" at Islington, which was never carried out. In 1853 he drew up several different ambitious plans for the laying out of the estate owned by the Commissioners of the 1851 Exhibition at South Kensington, one of which included a relocated National Gallery. In the event the area was developed piecemeal, and Pennethorne's contribution to the scheme, in his role as architect to the Office of Works, was a simple \\"junction\\" building containing offices and lecture theatre, linking the new iron museum buildings with existing structures, which had been adapted for use as an art school. He was one of the architects invited, in 1862, to submit designs for a memorial to Prince Albert, but his suggestion for a monument in the form of a Classical mausoleum was rejected in favour of George Gilbert Scott's Gothic construction. Unbuilt plans commissioned from Pennethorne included designs for new public offices in Downing Street, and a new War Office intended to be built in Pall Mall. His last work was for the University of London at 6 Burlington Gardens. The adjoining Burlington House, in Piccadilly, had been acquired by the government on his advice, to accommodate the learned societies removed from Somerset House, and the Royal Academy. The plans for the University of London were approved in 1866, but underwent some modification. Pennethorne was knighted, in recognition of his public services, in November 1870. His pupils included Henry Saxon Snell (1830‚Äì1904). His brother John Pennethorne (1808‚Äì1888) was also an architect.

It was one of the first sex manuals that entered mainstream culture in the 1960s, and had a profound effect on sex education and in liberalizing attitudes towards sex.CNN - Sex doctor David Reuben is back with some new advice February 5, 1999. Retrieved 7 March 2015. It was the most popular non-fiction book of its era and became part of the Sexual Revolution of modern America. The book was No. 1 best-seller in 51 countries and reached more than 100 million readers. In 1972 it was parodied by Woody Allen in the comedy film of the same name and received a favorable response from movie critics. The book made a large impact. It was favorably reviewed by the New York Times and Life Magazine, and, after a massive book tour, would go on to be #1 on the New York Times bestseller list for 55 weeks. Reuben became a celebrity, guesting on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, and attracting good ratings. As popular as the book was, it attracted critics in both the clinical world, and the public. The LGBT community objected to negative descriptions of homosexuality in the book (for example, Reuben wrote that gay men were \\"trying to solve the problem with only half the pieces\\"; lesbianism was relegated to a brief discussion in a section about prostitution). In 1972, Playboy magazine published an article purporting to expose 100 errors in the book. Reuben wrote an updated version which was published 30 years later, in 1999. In particular, his views on homosexuality, abortion, and pornography were modernized and updated.

A medical tattoo is a tattoo used to treat a condition, communicate information, or mark a body location.  Historical uses  A crude practice of corneal tattooing was performed by Galen in 150 CE. He tried to cover leucomatous opacities of the cornea by cauterizing the surface with a heated stilet and applying powdered nutgalls and iron or pulverized pomegranate bark mixed with copper salt; the practice was revived in the 1800s. With the rise of Christianity, tattooing declined and eventually became banned by a papal edict in 787 CE. The practice of corneal tattooing was revived by Louis Von Wecker in the 1870s.  To provide medical information  During the Cold War, threats of nuclear warfare led several U.S. states to consider blood type tattooing. Programs were spurred in Chicago, Utah and Indiana based on the premise that if an atomic bomb were to strike, the resulting damage would require extremely large amounts of blood within a short amount of time. Similar to dog tags, members of the U.S. military may have their vital information tattooed on themselves, usually on the rib cage below the armpit; they are referred to as \\"meat tags\\". Tattoos have also been used to provide notice to emergency personnel that a person has diabetes mellitus; people with this condition may fall into a diabetic coma and be unable to communicate that information.  For radiation treatment  Tattoos have been used as fiducial markers as an aid in guiding radiotherapy. Similarly, Scott Kelly utilized marker tattoos in the positioning of sonogram probes for multiple checks for atherosclerosis while on a long-duration mission on the International Space Station.  Paramedical tattoos  A paramedical tattoo is a cosmetic tattoo applied because of a medical condition or to disguise the results of its treatment. During breast reconstruction after mastectomy (removal of the breast for treatment of cancer), or breast reduction surgery, tattooing is sometimes used to replace the areola which has been removed during mastectomy, or to fill in areas of pigment loss which may occur during breast reduction performed with a free nipple graft technique. Other uses include simulating the appearance of fingernails and covering scars.

They emigrated from Yemen in the early 3rd century to the Levant region. Some merged with Hellenized Christian communities, converting to Christianity in the first few centuries AD, while others may have already been Christians before emigrating north to escape religious persecution. After settling in the Levant, the Ghassanids became a client state to the Byzantine Empire and fought alongside them against the Persian Sassanids and their Arab vassals, the Lakhmids. The lands of the Ghassanids also acted as a buffer zone protecting lands that had been annexed by the Romans against raids by Bedouin tribes. Few Ghassanids became Muslim following the Muslim conquest of the Levant; most Ghassanids remained Christian and joined Melkite and Syriac communities within what is now Jordan, Palestine, Syria and Lebanon. Migration from Yemen According to traditional historians, the Ghassanids were part of the al-Azd tribe, and they emigrated from South Arabia, modern day Yemen. They traveled across the Arabian Peninsula and eventually settled in the Roman limes. The tradition of Ghassanid migration finds support in the Geography of Claudius Ptolemy, which locates a tribe called the Kassanitai south of the Kinaidokolpitai and the river Baitios (probably the wƒÅdƒ´ Baysh). These are probably the people called Casani in Pliny the Elder, Gasandoi in Diodorus Siculus and Kasandreis in Photios (relying on older sources). The date of the migration to the Levant is unclear, but they are believed to have arrived in the region of Syria between 250-300 AD and later waves of migration circa 400 AD. Their earliest appearance in records is dated to 473 AD, when their chief Amorkesos signed a treaty with the Eastern Roman Empire acknowledging their status as foederati controlling parts of Palestine. He apparently became Chalcedonian at this time. By the year 510, the Ghassanids were no longer Miaphysite, but Chalcedonian.Irfan Shahid, 1989, Byzantium and the Arabs in the Fifth Century. They became the leading tribe among the Arab foederati, such as Banu Amela and Banu Judham. Near East in 565 AD, showing the Ghassanids and their neighbors. Ghassanid Kingdom The \\"Assanite Saracen\\" chief Podosaces that fought alongside the Sasanians during Julian's campaign in 363 might have been a Ghassanid. Roman vassal After originally settling in the Levant, the Ghassanids became a client state to the Eastern Roman Empire. The Romans found a powerful ally in the Ghassanids who acted as a buffer zone against the Lakhmids. In addition, as kings of their own people, they were also phylarchs, native rulers of client frontier states.Byzantium and the Arabs in the Sixth Century, vol. 1, Irfan Shah√Æd, 1995, p. 103Byzantium and the Arabs in the Sixth Century, Volume 2 part 2, Irfan Shah√Æd, pg. 164 The capital was at Jabiyah in the Golan Heights. Geographically, it occupied much of the eastern Levant, and its authority extended via tribal alliances with other Azdi tribes all the way to the northern Hijaz as far south as Yathrib (Medina). Byzantine‚ÄìPersian Wars The Ghassanids fought alongside the Byzantine Empire against the Persian Sassanids and Arab Lakhmids. The lands of the Ghassanids also continually acted as a buffer zone, protecting Byzantine lands against raids by Bedouin tribes. Among their Arab allies were the Banu Judham and Banu Amela. Arethas son of Jabala The Eastern Roman Empire was focused more on the East and a long war with the Persians was always their main concern. The Ghassanids maintained their rule as the guardian of trade routes, policed Lakhmid tribes and was a source of troops for the imperial army. The Ghassanid king al-Harith ibn Jabalah (reigned 529‚Äì569) supported the Byzantines against Sassanid Persia and was given in 529 by the emperor Justinian I, the highest imperial title that was ever bestowed upon a foreign ruler; also the status of patricians.Byzantium and the Arabs in the Sixth Century, vol. 2, part 1, Irfan Shah√Æd 1995, p. 51Byzantium and the Arabs in the Sixth Century, vol. 2, part 1, Irfan Shah√Æd 1995, p. 51-104 In addition to that, al-Harith ibn Jabalah was given the rule over all the Arab allies of the Byzantine Empire.Byzantium and the Arabs in the Sixth Century, vol. 2, part 1, Irfan Shah√Æd, 1995, p. 51 Al- Harith was a Miaphysite Christian; he helped to revive the Syrian Miaphysite (Jacobite) Church and supported Miaphysite development despite Orthodox Byzantium regarding it as heretical. Later Byzantine mistrust and persecution of such religious unorthodoxy brought down his successors, al-Mundhir (reigned 569‚Äì582) and Nu'man. The Ghassanids, who had successfully opposed the Persian allied Lakhmids of al-Hirah (Southern modern-day Iraq), prospered economically and engaged in much religious and public building; they also patronized the arts and at one time entertained the Arabian poets Nabighah adh-Dhubyani and Hassan ibn Thabit at their courts.Saudi Aramco World: The Kind of Ghassan. Barry Hoberman. http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198302/the.king.of.ghassan.htm Accessed 31 January 2014. Islamic conquest The Ghassanids remained a Byzantine vassal state until its rulers and the eastern Byzantine Empire were overthrown by the Muslims in the 7th century, following the Battle of Yarmuk in 636 AD. At the time of the Muslim conquest the Ghassanids were no longer united by the same Christian faiths: some of them accepted union with the Byzantine Chalcedonian church; others remained faithful to Miaphysitism and a significant number of them maintained their Christian religious identity and decided to side with the Muslim armies to emphasize their loyalty to their Arabic roots and in recognition of the wider context of a rising Arab Empire under the veil of Islam. It is worth noting that a significant percentage of the Muslim armies in the Battle of Mu'tah (ŸÖÿπÿ±ŸÉÿ© ŸÖÿ§ÿ™ÿ©) were Christian Arabs. Several of those Christian Arab tribes in today's modern Jordan who sided with the Muslim armies were recognized by exempting them from paying jizya (ÿ¨ÿ≤Ÿäÿ©). Jizya is a form of tax paid by non-Muslims ‚Äì Muslims paid another form of tax called Zakah (ÿ≤ŸÉÿßÿ©). Later those who remained Christian joined Melkite Syriac communities. The remnants of the Ghassanids were dispersed throughout Asia Minor. Nicephorus I is said to be a descendant from Jabalah ibn al-Aiham, the last Ghassanid ruler Jabalah ibn-al-Aiham's ordeal with Islam There are different opinions why Jabalah and his followers didn't convert to Islam. Some opinions go along the general idea that the Ghassanids were not interested yet in giving up their status as the lords and nobility of Syria. Below is quoted the story of Jabalah's return to the land of the Byzantines as told by 9th- century historian al-Baladhuri. > Jabalah ibn-al-Aiham sided with the Ansar (Azdi Muslims from Medina) saying, > \\"You are our brethren and the sons of our fathers\\" and professed Islam. > After the arrival of 'Umar ibn-al-Khattab in Syria, year 17 (636AD), Jabalah > had a dispute with one of the Muzainah and knocked out his eye. 'Umar > ordered that he be punished, upon which Jabalah said, \\"Is his eye like mine? > Never, by Allah, shall I abide in a town where I am under authority.\\" He > then apostatized and went to the land of the Greeks (the Byzantines).

Both were militarily successful allies of the Byzantines, especially against their enemies the Lakhmids, and secured Byzantium's southern flank and its political and commercial interests in Arabia proper. On the other hand, the Ghassanids remained fervently dedicated to Miaphysitism, which brought about their break with Byzantium and Mundhir's own downfall and exile, which was followed after 586 by the dissolution of the Ghassanid federation.; . The Ghassanids' patronage of the Miaphysite Syrian Church was crucial for its survival and revival, and even its spread, through missionary activities, south into Arabia. According to the historian Warwick Ball, the Ghassanids' promotion of a simpler and more rigidly monotheistic form of Christianity in a specifically Arab context can be said to have anticipated Islam.; . Ghassanid rule also brought a period of considerable prosperity for the Arabs on the eastern fringes of Syria, as evidenced by a spread of urbanization and the sponsorship of several churches, monasteries and other buildings. The surviving descriptions of the Ghassanid courts impart an image of luxury and an active cultural life, with patronage of the arts, music and especially Arab-language poetry. In the words of Ball, \\"the Ghassanid courts were the most important centres for Arabic poetry before the rise of the Caliphal courts under Islam\\", and their court culture, including their penchant for desert palaces like Qasr ibn Wardan, provided the model for the Umayyad caliphs and their court.; . After the fall of the first kingdom in the 7th century, several dynasties, both Christian and Muslim, ruled claiming to be a continuation of the House of Ghassan.Late Antiquity - Bowesock/Brown/Grabar, Harvard University Press, 1999, p. 469 Besides the Phocid or Nikephorian Dynasty of the Byzantine Empire, other rulers claimed to be the heirs of the Royal Ghassanids.

Three skilling banco error of color. A 1903 stamp of Sweden. Posten, the Swedish mail service, was established in 1636 by Axel Oxenstierna, and by the 18th century it had been extended throughout the country. The same century also saw the introduction of a practice unique to Sweden, that of attaching a feather to the wax seal of a letter to indicate that it needed to be delivered more quickly.  19th century  Sweden issued its first postage stamps on 1 July 1855, a set of five values denominated in skilling banco. These stamps depicted the coat of arms, were inscribed \\"SVERIGE\\", as have been all subsequent Swedish stamps, and were perforated. A printing error resulted in the Treskilling Yellow, a unique stamp that is currently the highest-priced in the world. The currency changed to √∂re and riksdaler on 1 July 1858, necessitating a new issue of stamps; the design was the same as before, but the stamps slightly smaller. A new design that included a reclining lion appeared in 1862, but it was used only for 3 √∂re, 17 √∂re, and 20 √∂re values before being superseded in 1872 by a design featuring a large numeral in a round frame. The numeral issue included Sweden's first bi- colored stamp; the 1-riksdaler value was printed in bistre and blue, and the center design was the Three Crowns of the royal arms. The numerals continued in use for nearly twenty years, the main change being the replacement of the riksdaler stamp with a 1-kronor value in 1878 (five years after the introduction of krona). The monarch made a first appearance on stamps in 1885, in the person of Oscar II, who was depicted in profile on a 10 √∂re value. The following year the practice began of printing a posthorn on the back of each stamp, underneath the gum. In 1889 a shortage of 10 √∂re values necessitated the surcharge of 12 √∂re and 24 √∂re numerals. In 1891 a new definitive series featured bi-colored numerals for low values and a profile of Oscar II for the 5 √∂re and up. On 26 October 1903, Sweden's first commemorative stamp came out; a 5-kronor value depicting the Stockholm Post Office on the occasion of its opening.  20th century  A new series of 1910 used an arms design for low values, and a full-face portrait of King Gustav V. Additional surcharges were needed in 1918 before new stamps of the series could be printed. 1920 saw the introduction of coil stamps using a lion design and a new portrait of Gustav, along with a crown and posthorn design for larger denominations, as well as a commemorative depicting Gustavus Adolphus and marking the 300th anniversary of a precursor mail route that ran from Stockholm to Hamburg. These and subsequent Swedish issues were usually issued in both booklet (or sheet) and coil form. During the 1920s, the 1920 definitives were gradually supplanted by a new series with a 3/4 profile of Gustav. In 1924, the Universal Postal Union celebrated its 50th anniversary and its Congress was held in Stockholm, so Sweden issued two series marking it, the first with a view of the Stockholm skyline, and the second with two designs; a postrider watching an airplane, and a carrier pigeon over a globe. Both sets were primarily aimed at collectors, but are nevertheless prized today. Another major commemorative set in 1936 marked the 300th anniversary of the postal service with 12 values each with its own design noting some aspect of Sweden's postal history to date. In 1939 a new series used a profile of Gustav for lower values, and the Three Crowns for higher; the crowns design continued in use into the 1960s. Meanwhile, the pattern for commemoratives was to issue about 3-4 each year, typically a single design in two denominations, with the lower value available in both booklet and coil form, and the higher as a coil stamp only. Gustaf VI Adolf appeared in profile from 1951 on. Czes≈Çaw S≈Çania began doing engraving for the post in 1959, and so became well known for work of exceptional quality. The definitives of 1967 were a major departure from tradition. Instead of portraits of the king, the 18 designs encompassed a wide variety of subjects, including wildlife, scenery, daily life, history, and legend, each realized in radically different styles.

The first selections were made at the end of the 19th century by the Comte d'Elva who was looking for subjects with \\"straight legs\\". But it was Paul D√©zamy who was especially responsible for fixing the type. He had understood that in order to catch a hare, dogs of a certain size were needed. He fixed the size at about 43 cm.

They are still used today to hunt boar, deer, and to track rabbit and hare, but are more commonly kept as a domestic pet. They are pack dogs, so owners should either spend a lot of time with them or get a second dog or a cat. They have a happy and confident personality, which can sometimes manifest itself as disobedience, but they are great companions.

Bauman University is the oldest and largest Russian technical university offering B.S., M.S. and PhD degrees in various engineering fields and applied sciences. History Russian anniversary postage stamp with the Main Building of the Bauman University, 2005 Bauman University is the second oldest educational institution in Russia after Lomonosov Moscow State University (1755). In 1763, the Russian empress Catherine II founded the Educational Imperial House. On 5 October 1826 the Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna issued a decree to establish ¬´great workshops for different crafts with bedrooms, a dining room, etc.¬ª as a part of the Moscow Foundling Home in the German Quarter. All craft pupils were moved from the Orphanage there. On 1 July 1830 Emperor Nicholas I approved ¬´Statute of Moscow Craft School¬ª. It was the inception of the first Russian technical university. Russia's developing industry needed skilled labor in many trades. So, the aim of the new school was to train skillful artisans with a solid theoretical background to improve and spread skills in various trades all over Russia. New school was created to teach various crafts as well as basic sciences. By 1868 education became so good that MCS was reorganised into the Imperial Moscow Technical School (IMTS) under the directorship of Victor Della-Vos. The main purpose of IMTS was to ¬´educate construction engineers, mechanical engineers and industrial technologists¬ª. IMTS achieved outstanding results in technology, chemical, food and textile industry, metal and wood treatment, and mechanical sciences. The IMTS was financially supported by the Government and industrialists. Its management was democratic. But a key feature of the new institution was its educational system called the \\"Russian method\\", which unifies a broad and intensive theoretical preparation with a deep practical education closely connected with industries. Under his leadership the school participated in the Universal Exposition in 1873 in Vienna and the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition of 1876, where this method won a gold prize. It proved to be influential on John Daniel Runkle when he introduced manual training alongside theoretical training at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It was also applied to other American technical universities. IMTS was recognized the best machine-building education institution of Russia and joined the ranks of the world leading polytechnic schools. A lot of outstanding scientists taught in IMTS, such as D. Mendeleev, N. Jukovsky, P. Chebychev, S. Chaplygin, A. Yershov, D. Sovetkin, F. Dmitriev, A. Letnikov, A. Gavrilenko. In the Soviet period it was renamed Bauman Moscow Higher Technical School (BMHTS), after revolutionary Nikolay Bauman. BMHTS continued education of engineers for machine and instrument building. In 1938, new military departments were created in MHTS: tank, artillery, and ammunition. In 1948, rocket department was added. During the first half of the 20th century, Bauman University formed and founded more than 70 technical universities in the USSR. Some of them are now well known institutions, such as Moscow Aviation Institute, Moscow Power Engineering Institute, Moscow University of Civil Engineering, Moscow Chemical Institute, Moscow Communication and Informatics University, Central Aerohydrodynamics Institute TSAGI, and the Military Academy of Aviation Engineering Joukovski. On 27 July 1989 USSR State committee for peoples education conferred on Moscow Higher Technical School a name of Bauman Moscow Technical University (BMSTU). BMSTU was honored to be the first Russian technical university. Nearly 200,000 students graduated from the University. Most of them chose to become scientists or engineers in leading research centers, universities, private and government owned companies. Many of government officials, chief designers, CEOs of big enterprises, and cosmonauts are Bauman graduates. Many Bauman University graduates are world-renowned: Sergei Korolev for the first satellite in space and first man and woman in space, Andrey Tupolev for the world first supersonic passenger plane, Nikolay Dollezhal for the world first civil nuclear plant, Vladimir Shukhov for the first method and the world first petrol cracking plant as well as for the first hyperboloid structures in architecture, Nikolay Zhukovsky for the foundation of aerodynamics and hydrodynamics sciences, Pavel Sukhoi for the foundation of Sukhoi Aerospace Design Bureau. Some of the specialized departments of BMSTU are located outside Moscow in cities of Moscow Oblast: Krasnogorsk (Russian: –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–≥–æ—Ä—Å–∫), Reutov (Russian: –†–µ—É—Ç–æ–≤), Korolyov (Russian: –ö–æ—Ä–æ–ª—ë–≤). There is also a large branch of the University in Kaluga (Russian: –ö–∞–ª—É–≥–∞). Bauman University today Main Building of the Bauman University. View from the Yauza River side BMSTU has 19 departments providing full-time education. University provides postgraduate and doctorate programs and has two affiliated secondary schools. More than 19,000 students study in BMSTU, and specialties cover all range of modern machine and instrument building. More than 320 doctor of sciences and 2000 candidates of science (equivalent to a Ph.D. or a D.Phil.) teach and do research in BMSTU. Main parts of the University are eight scientific and educational divisions. Each of them consists of scientific and educational branch. Several branch departments also exist, they deal with particular fields of industry. They are based on big factories and organizations, situated in Moscow, Moscow suburbs (Reutov, Krasnogorsk and Korolev) and in Kaluga. BMSTU has unique experience of teaching hearing-impaired students since 1934. Bauman University annually grants 800 to 3,000 students free room and board in one of 13 university residences. The Bauman University is commonly regarded as one of Russia's most prestigious universities and has high entry requirements for its prospective students. The Bauman University is regularly ranked on the first place in official government and business press rating. The Bauman University also regularly occupies top 3 places in rating of alumni hunted by biggest Russian companies. In 2011/2012 QS World University rankings BMSTU occupied the 379th position in overall ranking and the 229th in Engineering & IT section. The Bauman University has a National Research Center status, the financing of Bauman University is provided by a separate expense asset of Russian National Budget independently of Ministry of Education. Bauman University ‚Äì National Technological University ‚Äì carries research in cutting-edge areas of science and technology, basing on eight technological platforms. 32 companies included BMSTU in their innovational programs. Today the University conducts 90 considerable scientific programs in different fields. BMSTU is Skolkovo innovation center founder. The feature of BMSTU is a close cooperation with industrial, scientific, educational and cultural institutions. TsAGI, Jukovsky Air Force Academy, NAMI, TsIAM, some departments of Chemical Machine Building Institute, Chemical Technology Institute and Engineering Physics Institute, Military Academy of Chemical Defense, MAI, Power Engineering Institute, Architectural Institute, and another leading scientific, educational and industrial institutions are BMSTU successors. Their staff is aimed at new scientific and technological achievements. Now strategy of the University is to provide human resources for cutting-edge areas of Russian science and technology, in prior economic development directions of the country, such as: information and communication systems; nanosystems and materials industry; power supply and conservation; biosystems; security and counterterrorism; transportation and aerospace systems; promising military equipment. More than 200,000 engineers have graduated since the institute was founded. Educational programs Educational and Laboratory Building of the BMSTU and the monument to Sergei Korolev The admission process includes three exams on math, physics and Russian. The university accepts one in ten applicants, which means that there are more than 30000 applicants. More than 2,600 of them pass through two years of preparation courses, another 2,000 follow studies in high schools partners of Bauman University. Participation in admission process requires a gage of original high school certificate which prevents applicants to take part in Lomonosov Moscow State University admission process at the same time. The academic year in this university begins on 1 September, and is divided into two terms (semesters). Students take exams at the end of each semester. The course of study lasts 6 years without interrupt for engineer specialist degree. But over the last few years the Bauman University has continued to integrate with the Bologna Process. And today some students learn using two step educational system. The first two years students study general engineering subjects. In the third year students begin to study specialized subjects. All educational and scientific activities of BMSTU are future- oriented. It is taking part in conversion programs, defining priorities of new scientific areas development, developing foundations of government human resources system for high-tech industry. BMSTU combines precise calculations with engineering intuition, follows traditions of Russian engineering school method, subtly appreciates new fields of activity, carries socioeconomic approach to complex engineering problems and humanist approach to education. Students begin to work at the University's well-equipped laboratories and in senior years at various plants, design offices and research institutes of Russia. All of that allows BMSTU to be on the cutting edge of scientific and engineering progress.–û—Ç–∫—Ä—ã—Ç –ø–æ–¥–∑–µ–º–Ω—ã–π –ø–µ—Ä–µ—Ö–æ–¥ —É –£—á–µ–±–Ω–æ-–ª–∞–±–æ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∫–æ—Ä–ø—É—Å–∞ –ú–ì–¢–£ –∏–º. –ù. –≠. –ë–∞—É–º–∞–Ω–∞ .

It was fought on October 10, 1774, primarily between Virginia militia and Native Americans from the Shawnee and Mingo peoples. Along the Ohio River near modern Point Pleasant, West Virginia, forces under the Shawnee Chief Cornstalk attacked Virginia militia under Colonel Andrew Lewis, hoping to halt Lewis's advance into the Ohio Valley. After a long and furious battle, Cornstalk retreated. After the battle, the Virginians, along with a second force led by Lord Dunmore, the Royal Governor of Virginia, marched into the Ohio Valley and compelled Cornstalk to agree to a treaty, ending the war. Preparations Colonel Andrew Lewis, in command of about 1,000 men, was part of a planned two-pronged Virginian invasion of the Ohio Valley. As Lewis's force made its way down the Kanawha River, guided by pioneering hunter/trapper Matthew Arbuckle, Sr., Lewis anticipated linking up with another force commanded by Lord Dunmore, who was marching west from Fort Pitt, then known as Fort Dunmore. Dunmore's plan was to march into the Ohio Valley and force the indigenous inhabitants to accept Ohio River boundary which had been negotiated with the Iroquois in the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix. The Shawnee, however, had not been consulted in the treaty and many were not willing to surrender their lands south of the Ohio River without a fight. Officials of the British Indian Department, led by Sir William Johnson until his death in July 1774, worked to diplomatically isolate the Shawnee from their neighbors. As a result, when the war began, the Shawnees had few allies other than some Mingos. Cornstalk, the Shawnee leader, moved to intercept Lewis's army, hoping to prevent the Virginians from joining forces. Estimates of the size of Cornstalk's force have varied, but scholarswho? now believe Cornstalk was probably outnumbered at least 2 to 1, having between 300 and 500 warriors. Future Shawnee leader Blue Jacket probably took part in this battle. Battle Cornstalk's forces attacked Lewis's camp where the Kanawha River joins the Ohio River, hoping to trap him along a bluff. The battle lasted for hours and the fighting eventually became hand-to-hand. Cornstalk's voice was reportedly heard over the din of the battle, urging his warriors to \\"be strong.\\" Lewis sent several companies along the Kanawha and up a nearby creek to attack the warriors from the rear, which reduced the intensity of the Shawnee offensive. Captain George Mathews was credited with a flanking maneuver that initiated Cornstalk's retreat.Herndon, G. Melvin (1969). George Mathews, Frontier Patriot. The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, Vol. 77, No. 3 (Jul., 1969) pp. 311-312 At nightfall, the Shawnees quietly withdrew back across the Ohio. The Virginians had held their ground, and thus are considered to have won. Aftermath The Virginians lost about 75 killed and 140 wounded.Atkinson, George W., History of Kanawha County: from its organization in 1789 until the present time; Printed at the Office of the West Virginia Journal, 1876, 345 pgs. The Shawnee's losses could not be determined, since they carried away their wounded and threw many of the dead into the river.Randall, and Ryan History of Ohio p 96 The next morning, Colonel Christian, who had arrived shortly after the battle, marched his men over the battlefield. They found twenty-one dead warriors in the open, and twelve more were discovered hastily covered with brush and old logs. Among those killed was Pucksinwah, the father of Tecumseh. Besides scalps, the Virginians reportedly captured 40 guns, many tomahawks and some plunder which was later sold at auction for 74¬£ 4s 6d. The Battle of Point Pleasant forced Cornstalk to make peace in the Treaty of Camp Charlotte, ceding to Virginia the Shawnee claims to all lands south of the Ohio River (today's states of Kentucky and West Virginia). The Shawnee were also obligated in the Treaty of Camp Charlotte to return all white captives and stop attacking barges of immigrants traveling on the Ohio River.Hurt, R D. The Indian Frontier, 1763-1846. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 2002. Print. Colonel John Field, an ancestor of United States Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, was killed in the battle. Legacy and historical controversies In April 1775, before many of the Virginians had even returned home from Dunmore's War, the battles of Lexington and Concord took place in Massachusetts. The American Revolution had begun and Lord Dunmore led the British war effort in Virginia. By the end of that year, the same militiamen who had fought at Point Pleasant managed to drive Lord Dunmore and the British troops supporting him out of Virginia. Before his expulsion, Dunmore had sought to gain indigenous allies, including the Shawnee the militia had defeated at Point Pleasant. Many Virginians suspected he had collaborated with the Shawnee from the beginning. They claimed Dunmore had intentionally isolated the militia under Andrew Lewis, meaning for the Shawnee to destroy them before the Royal Army troops arrived. Dunmore hoped to eliminate the militia in case a rebellion did break out. However, there is no evidence to support this theory and it is generally discounted. On February 21, 1908, the United States Senate passed Bill Number 160 to erect a monument commemorating the Battle of Point Pleasant. It cites Point Pleasant as a \\"battle of the Revolution\\". The bill failed in the House of Representatives. Nevertheless, the Battle of Point Pleasant is honored as the first engagement of the American Revolution during \\"Battle Days\\", an annual festival in modern Point Pleasant, now a city in West Virginia.

Stu's Show. Retrieved 03-18-2013. Ruby-Spears Productions was founded in 1977 while Ruby and Spears were network executives at ABC supervising the Saturday morning programming. ABC Entertainment president Fred Silverman wanted to create competition for Hanna-Barbera, which then provided the bulk of the Saturday morning content for all three major networks. Silverman was concerned the studio was stretching their projects too thin, diluting the quality of their series, requiring competition. The company's first breakout was The Puppy Who Wanted A Boy. The company's credits include the animated series Fangface, Goldie Gold and Action Jack, The Plastic Man Comedy/Adventure Show, Thundarr the Barbarian, Rubik, the Amazing Cube, the 1983 version of the Alvin and the Chipmunks series, Mister T, Sectaurs, The Centurions, the 1988 Superman series, the Police Academy animated series and the American Mega Man cartoon series. Joe Ruby's and Ken Spears' favorite Ruby-Spears-produced show is Thundarr the Barbarian. Only two pre-1991 series, Police Academy: The Animated Series and Piggsburg Pigs!, used Canadian rather than American voice talent like most of their other cartoon shows. Ruby-Spears was also responsible for the animated sequence in the 1988 film Child's Play and replaying the sequence as a fictional commercial in the 1991 sequel Child's Play 3. The Ruby-Spears studio was founded in 1977 as a subsidiary of Filmways and was sold in late 1981 to Taft Broadcasting, becoming a sister company to Hanna-Barbera Productions. In 1991, Ruby-Spears was spun off into RS Holdings. Most of the pre-1991 Ruby-Spears Productions library was sold along with Hanna-Barbera to Turner Broadcasting System, which in turn merged with Time Warner (now WarnerMedia) in 1996. The Ruby-Spears studio closed in 1996 after 19 years of operation.Shostak, Stu (01-16-2013). \\"Program 305 (TV animation producers JOE RUBY and KEN SPEARS return to discuss the formation of their own company and creating such series as \\"Fangface\\", \\"Rickety Rocket\\", \\"Goldie Gold\\" and many others.

The fundamental concept of this theory is that when an acid and a base react with each other, the acid forms its conjugate base, and the base forms its conjugate acid by exchange of a proton (the hydrogen cation, or H+). This theory is a generalization of the Arrhenius theory.  Definitions of acids and bases  In the Arrhenius theory, acids are defined as substances that dissociate in aqueous solution to give H+ (hydrogen ions), while bases are defined as substances that dissociate in aqueous solution to give OH‚àí (hydroxide ions). In 1923 physical chemists Johannes Nicolaus Br√∏nsted in Denmark and Thomas Martin Lowry in England both independently proposed the theory that carries their names. In the Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry theory acids and bases are defined by the way they react with each other, which allows for greater generality. The definition is expressed in terms of an equilibrium expression : acid + base ‚áå conjugate base + conjugate acid. With an acid, HA, the equation can be written symbolically as: :HA + B <=> A- + HB+ The equilibrium sign, ‚áå, is used because the reaction can occur in both forward and backward directions. The acid, HA, can lose a proton to become its conjugate base, A‚àí. The base, B, can accept a proton to become its conjugate acid, HB+. Most acid- base reactions are fast so that the components of the reaction are usually in dynamic equilibrium with each other.  Aqueous solutions  Acetic acid, a weak acid, donates a proton (hydrogen ion, highlighted in green) to water in an equilibrium reaction to give the acetate ion and the hydronium ion. Red: oxygen, black: carbon, white: hydrogen. Consider the following acid‚Äìbase reaction: :CH3 COOH + H2O <=> CH3 COO ^{-} + H3O+ Acetic acid, CH3COOH, is an acid because it donates a proton to water (H2O) and becomes its conjugate base, the acetate ion (CH3COO‚àí). H2O is a base because it accepts a proton from CH3COOH and becomes its conjugate acid, the hydronium ion, (H3O+). The reverse of an acid-base reaction is also an acid-base reaction, between the conjugate acid of the base in the first reaction and the conjugate base of the acid. In the above example, acetate is the base of the reverse reaction and hydronium ion is the acid. :H3O ^{+} + CH3 COO- <=> CH3 COOH + H2O The power of the Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry theory is that, in contrast to Arrhenius theory, it does not require an acid to dissociate.  Amphoteric substances  The amphoteric nature of water The essence of Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry theory is that an acid only exists as such in relation to a base, and vice versa. Water is amphoteric as it can act as an acid or as a base. In the image shown at the right one molecule of H2O acts as a base and gains H+ to become H3O+while the other acts as an acid and loses H+ to become OH‚àí. Another example is furnished by substances like aluminium hydroxide, Al(OH)3. :Al (OH)3 + OH- <=> Al(OH)^{-}4, acting as an acid :3H+ + Al (OH)3<=> 3H2O + Al^{3+} (aq) , acting as a base  Non-aqueous solutions  The hydrogen ion, or hydronium ion, is a Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry acid in aqueous solutions, and the hydroxide ion is a base, by virtue of the self-dissociation reaction :H2O + H2O <=> H3O+ + OH- An analogous reaction occurs in liquid ammonia :NH3 + NH3 <=> NH4+ + NH2^{-} Thus, the ammonium ion, , plays the same role in liquid ammonia as does the hydronium ion in water and the amide ion, , is analogous to the hydroxide ion. Ammonium salts behave as acids, and amides behave as bases. Some non-aqueous solvents can behave as bases, that is, proton acceptors, in relation to Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry acids. :HA + S <=> A- + SH+ where S stands for a solvent molecule. The most important such solvents are dimethylsulfoxide, DMSO, and acetonitrile, CH3CN, as these solvents have been widely used to measure the acid dissociation constants of organic molecules. Because DMSO is a stronger proton acceptor than H2O the acid becomes a stronger acid in this solvent than in water. Indeed, many molecules behave as acids in non-aqueous solution that do not do so in aqueous solution. An extreme case occurs with carbon acids, where a proton is extracted from a C-H bond. Some non-aqueous solvents can behave as acids. An acidic solvent will increase basicity of substances dissolved in it. For example, the compound CH3COOH is known as acetic acid because of its acidic behaviour in water. However it behaves as a base in liquid hydrogen chloride, a much more acidic solvent. :HCl + CH3COOH <=> Cl- + CH3C(OH)2+  Comparison with Lewis acid‚Äìbase theory In the same year that Br√∏nsted and Lowry published their theory, G. N. Lewis proposed an alternative theory of acid‚Äìbase reactions. The Lewis theory is based on electronic structure. A Lewis base is defined as a compound that can donate an electron pair to a Lewis acid, a compound that can accept an electron pair.Miessler, G. L., Tarr, D. A., (1991) \\"Inorganic Chemistry\\" 2nd ed. Pearson Prentice-Hall pp. 170‚Äì172 Lewis's proposal gives an explanation to the Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry classification in terms of electronic structure. :HA + B <=> A- + BH+ In this representation both the base, B, and the conjugate base, A‚àí, are shown carrying a lone pair of electrons and the proton, which is a Lewis acid, is transferred between them. Adduct of ammonia and boron trifluoride Lewis later wrote in \\"To restrict the group of acids to those substances that contain hydrogen interferes as seriously with the systematic understanding of chemistry as would the restriction of the term oxidizing agent to substances containing oxygen.\\" In Lewis theory an acid, A, and a base, B:, form an adduct, AB, in which the electron pair is used to form a dative covalent bond between A and B. This is illustrated with the formation of the adduct H3N‚àíBF3 from ammonia and boron trifluoride, a reaction that cannot occur in aqueous solution because boron trifluoride reacts violently with water in a hydrolysis reaction. :: BF3 + 3H2O -> B (OH)3 + 3HF :: HF <=> H+ + F- These reactions illustrate that BF3 is an acid in both Lewis and Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry classifications and emphasizes the consistency between both theories. Boric acid is recognized as a Lewis acid by virtue of the reaction :B(OH)3 + H2O <=> B(OH)4- + H+ In this case the acid does not dissociate, it is the base, H2O that dissociates. A solution of B(OH)3 is acidic because hydrogen ions are liberated in this reaction. There is strong evidence that dilute aqueous solutions of ammonia contain negligible amounts of the ammonium ion :H2O + NH3 -> OH- + NH+4 and that, when dissolved in water, ammonia functions as a Lewis base.  Comparison with the Lux‚ÄìFlood theory  The reactions between oxides in the solid or liquid state are not included in Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry theory. For example, the reaction :2MgO + SiO2 -> Mg2 SiO4 does not fall within the scope of the Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry definition of acids and bases. On the other hand, magnesium oxide acts as a base when it reacts with an aqueous solution of an acid. :2H+ + MgO(s) -> Mg^{2+}(aq) + 2H2O Dissolved SiO2 has been predicted to be a weak acid in the Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry sense. :SiO2(s) + 2H2O <=> Si(OH)4 (solution) :Si(OH)4 <=> Si(OH)3O- + H+ According to the Lux‚ÄìFlood theory compounds such as MgO and SiO2 in the solid state may be classified as acids or bases. For example, the mineral olivine may be regarded as a compound of a basic oxide, MgO, with an acidic oxide, silica, SiO2. This classification is important in geochemistry.

Situated in the Longfellow Mountains in the Maine Highlands Region, the lake is the source of the Kennebec River. Towns that border the lake include Greenville to the south and Rockwood to the northwest. There are over 80 islands in the lake, the largest being Sugar Island with the almost as large Deer Island to the west. History Mount Kineo, with 700-foot (200 m) cliffs rising straight up from Moosehead Lake, has attracted visitors for centuries, from early American Indians (Red Paint People), to later tribes seeking its rhyolite to make stone tools, Penobscots and Norridgewocks, the Abenaki bands who battled here with their enemy the Mohawks, to 19th-century \\"rusticators\\" traveling by railroad and steamboat and today's hotel guests. Various species dwell among its cliffs and talus slopes, including peregrine falcons and rare plants. The Moosehead region includes the headwaters of the Kennebec, the West Branch of the Penobscot, the Piscataquis, the Pleasant, and the Saint John rivers. Henry David Thoreau and other 19th-century visitors remarked on the beauty of the area. The region has a large moose population; moose outnumber people 3:1. However, the name of the region derives from the remarkable similarity between maps of the lake and an antlered moose. Henry David Thoreau described the lake as ‚Äú...a gleaming silver platter at the end of the table.‚Äù Hunters at Camp Russell, northeast of Moosehead Lake, 1888 Geography Shoreline in 1912 Set at an elevation of 1,023 feet (312 m), Moosehead Lake is approx. 40 by 10 miles (64 by 16 km), with an area of nearly 118 mile¬≤ (approx. 303 km¬≤), and over 400 miles (640 km) of shoreline. Its major inlet is the Moose River, which, east of Jackman, flows through Long Pond to Brassua Lake. To the east of Moosehead Lake, the Roach River is its second largest tributary. Flowing out of Moosehead Lake to the southwest are its east and west outlets‚Äîthe Kennebec River. The Moosehead Lake Region encompasses 4,400 square miles (11,000 km¬≤) of West Central Maine, and includes 127 townships in addition to Moosehead Lake. The region is drained by 330 miles (530 km) of main stem rivers, into which flow 3,850 miles (6,200 km) of smaller tributaries. During the last glacial era, more than 1,200 natural lakes and ponds were carved into its landscape, varying in size from one acre (4,000 m¬≤) ponds to Moosehead, at 75,451 acres (303 km¬≤) one of the largest natural freshwater lakes in the United States. The total area of all standing surface waters in the region is more than 238,000 acres (963 km¬≤)‚Äî24% of the total area of lakes and ponds in Maine. Development plans Seattle-based Plum Creek Real Estate Investment Corporation, the largest private United States landowner, submitted a development proposal for the Moosehead region in April 2005. It was the largest development ever proposed for the state of Maine. The initial version of the scheme called for 975 house lots, two resorts, a golf course, a marina, three RV parks, and more than 100 rental cabins. However, Plum Creek was defunct as of 2016 and all development plans have been cancelled.

It was formed in 1999 through the merger of BTR plc and Siebe plc. It had offices in more than 50 countries and its products were sold in around 180 countries. The company was founded on 1 April 1920 as Siebe Gorman & Company Ltd and continued through various name changes registered at Companies House from that date. In January 2014 the company was taken over by the French multinational Schneider Electric for a total consideration of $5.5 billion. Schneider phased out the \\"Invensys\\" name in favour of its own. Invensys lines of business were grouped into four segments: Software, Industrial Automation, Energy Controls and Appliance. Its brands included Avantis, Eurotherm, Foxboro, IMServ, InFusion, Triconex, SimSci, Skelta, Wonderware, Drayton, Eberle, Eliwell. History Invensys was formed through the merger of BTR plc and Siebe plc in 1999. From 1999 to 2004, it underwent a major restructuring programme to cut its costs as falling sales and large debts had led to the danger of its going bankrupt. A major disposal programme combined with a ¬£2.7bn debt restructuring in 2004 saved it from collapse. During that time it bought and sold The Baan Corporation. In March 2011, Wayne Edmunds, who had been chief financial officer since 2009, was appointed Chief Executive, replacing Ulf Henriksson. According to The Financial Times, Henriksson, who had been Chief Executive since 2005, had had differences with chairman Nigel Rudd over running the company, in spite of the return to financial health under Henriksson. During 2011 and early 2012 the share price fell nearly 50%, in part due to delays costing ¬£40 million in producing control and safety systems for eight Chinese nuclear reactors.

It had a range of up to , and was intended to allow US Air Force strategic bombers to penetrate Soviet airspace by neutralizing surface-to-air missile defenses. SRAM was designed to replace the older AGM-28 Hound Dog standoff missile which was tasked with the same basic role. Hound Dog was a very large missile that could only be carried in pairs by the B-52, so some aircraft were tasked with suppressing Soviet missile and radar sites while others would carry on to strike their strategic targets. SRAM was so much smaller that a number could be carried along with other weapons, allowing a single aircraft to blast its own way through to its targets. SRAM entered service in 1972 and was carried by a number of aircraft, including the B-52, FB-111A, and the B-1B. In September 1980 a ground fire raised concerns about the safety of the warhead, and in 1990 they were temporarily removed from service while safety checks were carried out. These revealed a number of the missile's rocket motors had developed cracks that could have resulted in them exploding when launched. The SRAM was removed from service in 1993, by which time its mission was rendered obsolete by the introduction of the AGM-86, which could be launched from far outside the range of Soviet weapons, and no longer required the bombers to penetrate Soviet defenses. History The Air Force had been considering the idea of a medium-range missile to attack air defense sites since the mid-1950s. This concept became more important with the Soviet introduction of the SA-2 missile, which presented a serious threat to the United States Air Force Strategic Air Command's (SAC) bomber fleet. The first attempt to address this role led to the GAM-67 Crossbow, which flew for the first time in 1956. However, the Crossbow's subsonic speed meant it could not get far enough ahead of the bomber to be useful. A supersonic development, the Longbow, was under development, but ultimately cancelled as well. The role was finally filled by the AGM-28 Hound Dog, a much larger supersonic missile. The Hound Dog served the dual purpose of attacking defense sites as well as being a stand-off missile to use against strategic targets so that the bombers did not have to approach them. However, Hound Dog was so large that only two could be carried by a B-52, and only if it removed all other weapons. A more practical system specifically for the counter-defense role was highly desirable. AGM-69A SRAM The requirement for the weapon was issued by the Strategic Air Command in 1964, and the resultant AGM-69A SRAM contract was awarded to Boeing in 1966. After delays and technical flaws during testing, it was ordered into full production in 1971 and entered service in August 1972. It was carried by the B-52, FB-111A, and, for a very short period starting in 1986, by B-1Bs based at Dyess AFB in Texas. SRAMs were also carried by the B-1Bs based at Ellsworth AFB in South Dakota, Grand Forks AFB in North Dakota, and McConnell AFB in Kansas up until late 1993. SRAM had an inertial navigation system as well as a radar altimeter which enabled the missile to be launched in either a semi-ballistic or terrain-following flight path. The SRAM was also capable of performing one \\"major maneuver\\" during its flight which gave the missile the capability of reversing its course and attacking targets that were behind it, sometimes called an \\"over-the-shoulder\\" launch. The missile had a circular error probable (CEP) of about and a maximum range of . The SRAM used a single W69 nuclear warhead with a variable yield of 17 kilotons as a fission weapon, or 210 kilotons as a fusion weapon with tritium boost enabled. The aircrew could turn a switch on the Class III command to select the destructive yield required. The SRAM missile was completely coated with of soft rubber, used to absorb radar energy and also dissipate heat during flight. The three fins on the tail were made of a phenolic material, also designed to minimize any reflected radar energy. All electronics, wiring, and several safety devices were routed along the top of the missile, inside a raceway. On the B-52 SRAMs were carried externally on two wing pylons (six missiles on each pylon) and internally on an eight-round rotary launcher mounted in the bomb bay; maximum load-out was 20 missiles. The capacity of the B-1B was eight missiles on up to three rotary launchers (one in each of its three stores bays) for a maximum loadout of 24 missiles, all internal. The smaller FB-111A could carry two missiles internally and four more missiles under the aircraft's swing-wing. The externally mounted missiles required the addition of a tailcone to reduce aerodynamic drag during supersonic flight of the aircraft. Upon rocket motor ignition, the missile tailcone was blown away by the exhaust plume. About 1,500 missiles were built at a cost of about $592,000 each by the time production ended in 1975. The Boeing Company sub-contracted with the Lockheed Propulsion Company for the propellants, which subsequently closed with the end of the SRAM program. AGM-69B SRAM An upgraded AGM-69B SRAM was proposed in the late 1970s, with an upgraded motor to be built by Thiokol and a W80 warhead, but it was cancelled by President Jimmy Carter (along with the B-1A) in 1978. Various plans for alternative guidance schemes, including an anti- radar seeker for use against air defense installations and even a possible air-to-air missile version, came to nothing. AGM-131 SRAM II A new weapon, the AGM-131 SRAM II, began development in 1981, intended to arm the resurrected B-1B, but it was cancelled in 1991 by President George Bush, along with most of the U.S. Strategic Modernization effort (including Peacekeeper Mobile (Rail) Garrison, Midgetman small ICBM and Minuteman III modernization) in an effort by the U.S. to ease nuclear pressure on the disintegrating Soviet Union. 1990s In June 1990, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney ordered the missiles removed from bombers on alert pending a safety inquiry. A decade earlier in September 1980, A B-52H on alert status at Grand Forks AFB in northeastern North Dakota experienced a wing fire that burned for three hours, fanned by evening winds of . The wind direction was parallel to the fuselage, which likely had SRAMs in the main bay. Eight years later, weapons expert Roger Batzel testified to a closed U.S. Senate hearing that a change of wind direction could have led to a conventional explosion and a widespread scattering of radioactive plutonium. The AGM-69A was retired in 1993 over growing concerns about the safety of its warhead and rocket motor. There were serious concerns about the solid rocket motor, when several motors suffered cracking of the propellant, thought to occur due to the hot/cold cycling year after year. Cracks in the propellant could cause catastrophic failure once ignited. The SRAM was effectively replaced by the AGM-86 cruise missile.

Olympics 1960 Sam Hall's extraordinary athletic career began at Kettering-Fairmont High School; he was a two-time letterwinner in track and field. During his senior season (1955), Sam established a school record in the pole vault (11-3). His record setting performance came at the Miami Valley League Championships, helping propel Fairmont to the MVL team title; the first in school history. While attending Fairmont, Sam also competed in springboard diving; a sport he pursued at the club level. In the fall of 1955, Hall enrolled at the Ohio State University; while attending O.S.U, Sam lettered in four sports ‚Äì gymnastics, soccer, track and diving. As a trackman, Hall competed in the pole vault and javelin; his success in those events led to a crossroads: should he pursue a berth on the US Olympic track and field team, or concentrate on diving. Ultimately, Sam chose diving; he was rewarded with international acclaim. During 1959‚Äì1960, Sam won two Big-Ten Conference championships, three NCAA championships, and three U.S. Amateur Athletic Union titles.

The University confers Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees in its undergraduate program, and Master of Arts and Master of Business Administration degrees, as well as graduate study certificates, in its graduate program. Assumption also offers a variety of dual degree and accelerated bachelor‚Äôs/master‚Äôs programs. With the transition from Assumption College to Assumption University in 2020, Assumption reorganized into five schools: College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Grenon School of Business, School of Nursing, School of Health Professions, and School of Graduate Studies. History Undergraduate day college Assumption was founded in 1904 by the Augustinians of the Assumption, a Catholic order under the Augustinian Rule dedicated to service through teaching and the hastening of the Kingdom of God, as reflected in their motto \\"Thy Kingdom Come.\\" The original campus was in the Greendale section of Worcester, on a tract of hillside land. In these early years, enrollment was exclusively male, primarily of French-Canadian heritage. Most courses were taught in French, with only a small number taught in English. Tornado damage In June 1953, a tornado cut a path of destruction through several western and central Massachusetts communities, including the city of Worcester. Several campus buildings were destroyed or severely damaged. Although the previously co- located Assumption Preparatory School stayed on the rebuilt campus until 1970, the then-College relocated to a new campus off Salisbury Street, on the west side of the city, officially opening in 1956. The old Assumption campus complex was sold to the state after the prep school closed and is today the home of Quinsigamond Community College. In 1969, Assumption became a coeducational institution, allowing both laymen and women into the faculty, and female students into its programs of study. Centennial festivities began in January 2004, celebrating Assumption's 100th year. On February 15, 2007, the Assumption Board of Trustees announced that Dr. Francesco C. Cesareo, an author and historian, would succeed President Thomas R. Plough on July 1, 2007. As the 15th president of the institution, Plough oversaw an aggressive eight-year Centennial Campaign that raised over $33 million for campus renovations and construction. Since President Cesareo‚Äôs appointment, Assumption has experienced a period of growth in its academic programs and facilities. In addition to raising funds for the Tinsley Camus Ministry Center, President Cesareo also raised funds for the state-of-the-art Tsotsis Family Academic Center and Health Sciences Building. Funds raised during the Capital Campaign for Assumption College: Light the Way were used to construct Tsotsis, or TFAC as students refer to the academic building, and the Health Sciences Building which will host the nursing and physicians assistant programs. President Cesareo also established Assumption‚Äôs first international campus in Rome, Italy. Continuing education Assumption's first effort at continuing education began in 1954 with the founding of the Evening College, later known as the St. Augustine Institute. Non-credit courses were offered two years later with the founding of the Adult Education Center. These facilities were coeducational and open to the public. Assumption phased out both facilities in the late 1960s. In 1979, Assumption launched a second effort at continuing adult education with the Center for Continuing and Professional Education, renamed in 2007 the Center for Continuing and Career Education. This new facility combined the credited courses of the old Evening College and the non-credit work of the Adult Education Center into one office. The Center celebrated its 25th anniversary in the same year as the undergraduate studies' centennial. In 2020, after extensive analysis, Assumption University decided to sunset the Continuing and Career Education division. The decision reflected market realities exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and opportunities that point in new directions for adult learners at the University, namely in the area of graduate studies. =College institutes= The French Institute (Institut Fran√ßais), founded in 1979, serves as a specialized research center for students studying French history, culture, and language. The Institute was founded by Father Wilfrid J. Dufault, A.A., the late chancellor emeritus of Assumption, and Dr. Claire Quintal, founding director emerita, to preserve the French heritage of Assumption and of the New England region. The Institute is both an academic research facility and a center for French cultural activities. Although its main goals are to foster the preservation and study of the records of the history and cultural traditions of French ethnicity on this continent, the name \\"French Institute\\" (\\"Institut fran√ßais\\") was chosen to encompass the entire Francophone world. The Institute is the leading place to study material relating to the more than 1.5 million French Canadians who immigrated to New England in the 19th and 20th centuries. View of the entry to Assumption University and of the Blessed Virgin from the La Maison building As a research center, the French Institute acquires books, documents, and artifacts pertinent to its primary focus: the French presence in North America, with particular emphasis on New England. All aspects of this presence are of interest to the Institute: social, political, cultural, religious, literary, etc. The personal collection of Dr. Quintal formed the early nucleus of the holdings. The donation of their fine library by the Fall River Dominicans greatly enhanced the Institute's book collection, which had begun to grow with gifts of duplicate books by ACA Assurance (formerly the Association Canado-Am√©ricaine) and later the Union St. Jean- Baptiste. From 2003 to 2005, book donations by Dr. Armand Chartier, Arthur L. Eno, Dr. Gerard Brault, and others expanded the library significantly. Documents and artifacts include rich private archives donated by the Jobin- Thibodeau family and by former advisory board president, the late Wilfrid J. Michaud, Jr. In 2004, the Institute's collection was complemented by the arrival on campus of the Mallet Library of the Union St. Jean-Baptiste, a notable collection of Franco-Americana compiled by a successful Franco- American immigrant, Major Edmond Mallet, in the late 19th century.  Campus life   Residence halls  First-year student housing: Desautels and Alumni halls are double-style residence halls located in the heart of campus. Worcester and Salisbury Halls also house first-year students and sophomores. Worcester and Salisbury are composed of triple rooms with some singles. Hanrahan Hall is the Honors Housing option for first-year students. Nault is a substance-free residence hall, housing students of all four class years. Nault Hall offers singles, doubles, and triples. Upperclass housing: All upperclassmen can live in the above residence halls, as well as other residence halls on campus. Young Hall is on \\"The Hill\\" with Hanrahan, Nault, and the Aubuchon and Bissonnette townhouses. Young Hall houses mostly sophomores and some juniors in singles, doubles, and triples. The Aubuchon townhouses are six-person apartments, and the Bissonnette townhouses are four- person apartments. Aubuchon and Bissonnette have living rooms, kitchens, bathrooms, and double bedrooms. The apartments are collectively called \\"The Ts,\\" and students typically refer to them by number: T-1, T-2 etc. Wachusett Hall and Moquin Hall are five-person apartments. Wachusett is composed mostly of juniors and features living rooms, kitchens, private bathrooms, and two bedrooms (one double and one triple). Moquin is in an area of campus known as the \\"Valley,\\" which is a primarily senior area. Moquin offers living rooms, kitchens, private bathrooms, and three bedrooms (two doubles and one single). Moquin is typically referred to as the ‚Äú5‚Äôs.‚Äù Also in the Valley is Dion Hall, which has the same set-up as the Bissonnette townhouses (\\"4‚Äôs\\"). Authier and Dufault halls round out the Valley housing options. They are six-person apartments and are often referred to as ‚Äú6‚Äôs‚Äù. Authier and Dufault offer living rooms, kitchens, private bathrooms, and three double bedrooms. Built in 2001, Plough Hall (formerly known as North Hall) and South Hall are six-person apartments in the upper part of campus. Plough and South Halls feature four bedrooms (two doubles and two singles), kitchens, two private bathrooms, and living rooms. Finally, West Hall is made up of four-person suites (sometimes five-person suites) with two bedrooms and a bathroom but no kitchens. Living/Learning Center: Built in 1998, The Living/Learning Center (or LLC) is an exception to the other residence halls because students must apply to live in this building. Every other residence hall must be selected during room selection in the spring. A group of faculty and staff evaluate LLC applications and select the residents based on certain criteria. The residence hall accommodates four students, split up into two double bedrooms. It features a kitchen, living room, and a private bathroom. Before fall 2006, students needed to perform individual projects all centered on a topic the group decided on in the selection period. Starting in the 2006-2007 year, each student who lives in the LLC must attend Interest Circles with various professors on a large amount of diverse topics. These topics include music, politics, psychology, the environment, etc. The students change their interest circles each semester. Student publications * Le Provocateur (student newspaper): This student-edited publication is published bimonthly and distributed to all members of the Assumption community. Le Provocateur also called \\"The Provoc,\\" has a staff of student editors and contributing writers, a faculty advisor from the English Department, and an advisor from the Office of Student Activities. * Heights (yearbook) * Thoreau's Rooster (creative nonfiction journal) Athletics Assumption University teams participate as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division II. The Greyhounds are a member of the Northeast-10 Conference (NE-10). Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, tennis and track & field; women's sports include basketball, cross country, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, rowing, soccer, softball, swimming & diving, tennis, track & field, and volleyball. Assumption University is home to the 2015 and 2017 Northeast 10 Football Champions. Athletic facilities Multi-sport stadium: With more than $21 million raised toward the $30 million goal for the Centennial Campaign (celebrating Assumption's 100-year history), Assumption announced plans to construct a $3.2 million multi-sport stadium, which opened in September 2005. The stadium is the key capital project of the second phase of the Centennial Campaign. View of the multi-sport stadium at Assumption University The stadium was constructed on the previous site of Assumption's football/lacrosse field. The new facility supports six athletic teams (football, men's and women's lacrosse, men's and women's soccer, and field hockey) and an outdoor intramural sports program on an infilled, synthetic turf field. It includes lights, elevated grandstand seating for approximately 1,200 spectators, a press box and a president's box. The stadium includes a dedicated practice area north of the competition field.

Pilgrimage The wooden statue of Our Lady, dating from the thirteenth century, was originally placed in a mighty linden tree located at this site. According to the legend a blind man regained his eyesight after praying before the statue. After that miracle a stone altar was erected in front of the tree. The first wooden chapel was built in 1263. A larger church was built in 1512 but was destroyed during the Thirty Years' War. The present pilgrimage church 'Visitation of Our Lady' goes back to a church built in 1695-1710 following a design thought to resemble the Temple in Jerusalem. However, all but the mighty Renaissance fa√ßade had to be torn down already three years later because the structure had become unsafe. The fourth and present church in Baroque style was then built 1715-1723, and financed by the local nobleman and owner Count Franz Anton von G√∂tzen. Around the church and village a huge calvary (a set of chapels dedicated to the Passion of Christ) was built. In 1936 the church received the status of a 'Basilica minor' from Pope Pius XI.

The kinematics of a three-body decay can be completely described using two variables. In a traditional Dalitz plot, the axes of the plot are the squares of the invariant masses of two pairs of the decay products. (For example, if particle A decays to particles 1, 2, and 3, a Dalitz plot for this decay could plot m212 on the x-axis and m223 on the y-axis.) If there are no angular correlations between the decay products then the distribution of these variables is flat. However symmetries may impose certain restrictions on the distribution. Furthermore, three-body decays are often dominated by resonant processes, in which the particle decays into two decay products, with one of those decay products immediately decaying into two additional decay products. In this case, the Dalitz plot will show a non-uniform distribution, with a peak around the mass of the resonant decay. In this way, the Dalitz plot provides an excellent tool for studying the dynamics of three-body decays. Dalitz plots play a central role in the discovery of new particles in current high-energy physics experiments, including Higgs boson research, and are tools in exploratory efforts that might open avenues beyond the Standard Model.P. Pakhlov and T. Uglov, Flavor physics at Super B-factories era, J. Phys.: Conf. Ser. 675, 022009 (2016). R.H. Dalitz introduced this technique in 1953 to study decays of K mesons (which at that time were still referred to as \\"tau- mesons\\"). It can be adapted to the analysis of four-body decays as well. A specific form of a four-particle Dalitz plot (for non-relativistic kinematics), which is based on a tetrahedral coordinate system, was first applied to study the few-body dynamics in atomic four-body fragmentation processes.

Debord defines the d√©rive as \\"a mode of experimental behavior linked to the conditions of urban society: a technique of rapid passage through varied ambiances.\\" It is an unplanned journey through a landscape, usually urban, in which participants drop their everyday relations and \\"let themselves be drawn by the attractions of the terrain and the encounters they find there\\". Though solo d√©rives are possible, Debord indicates > that the most fruitful numerical arrangement consists of several small > groups of two or three people who have reached the same level of awareness, > since cross-checking these different groups' impressions makes it possible > to arrive at more objective conclusions. The d√©rive's goals include studying the terrain of the city (psychogeography) and emotional disorientation, both of which lead to the potential creation of Situations. History The concept of the d√©rive has its origins in the Letterist International, an avant-garde and Marxist collective based in Paris. The d√©rive was a critical tool for understanding and developing the theory of psychogeography, defined as the \\"specific effects of the geographical environment (whether consciously organized or not) on the emotions and behavior of individuals.\\" The d√©rive continued to be a critical concept in the theories of the Situationist International, a radical group of avant-garde artists and political theorists that was formed out of the Letterist International, CoBrA, and the International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus in the 1950s. For the Situationists, the d√©rive was a revolutionary technique to combat the malaise and boredom of the society of the spectacle. D√©rives are necessary, according to Situationist theory, because of the increasingly predictable and monotonous experience of everyday life in advanced capitalism. Debord observes in his Introduction to a Critique of Urban Geography: Praxis Several groups have adopted the concept of the d√©rive and applied it in their own form, including many modern organizations, most notably the Loiterers Resistance Movement (Manchester), the London Psychogeographical Association, Wrights and Sites (notably the misguided drifts of mythogeographer Phil Smith), the Unilalia Group, and the Providence Initiative for Psychogeographic Studies. Since 2003 in the United States, separate events known as the Providence Initiative for Psychogeographic Studies and Psy-Geo- Conflux have been dedicated to action-based participatory experiments similar to the d√©rive within the context of psychogeography. Technology A smartphone app named D√©rive was developed in the 21st century by a team including Eduardo Cachucho and Babak Fakhamzadeh. The smartphone app shows a series of simple geography-based directions on a mobile device's screen such as \\"follow a red vehicle\\" to create the d√©rive to experience. There is also a similar application with the same name from a Russian developer who does not require installation and works directly in a browser with an additional mapping drift mode, where the application generates a point on the map to move to. In March of 2020, an iOS and Android app called Randonautica launched and cited Guy Debord's essay on D√©rive as a core inspiration. It uses a variety of high-entropy random number generator to seed a random map location that the user is prompted to walk to while holding an intention in mind.

Nine crew of the second boat, Friend to all Nations, died in the storm of 1897, but the boat survived both that and being lost while under tow the following year. A memorial to the nine men stands on the Margate seafront. A third boat was built in 1899 but by then surfboats powered by oar and sail had been largely superseded by lifeboats. The third boat served as a tender at Chatham during the Second World War and was lost off Ostend in 1957. All three were built by J. Samuel White of Cowes. Friend of all Nations After the dramatic rescue in January 1857 of the crew of the Northern Belle in which the Margate lugger Victory was lost with all hands, 50 boatmen decided to establish a dedicated surfboat service for maritime rescue. This first boat, the Friend of all Nations could be launched by four men without the need of horses and entered service in November 1857. She was almost wrecked on 13 February 1860 attempting to rescue the crew of the Spanish brig Samaritano, which, at about 5.30am, ran onto the Margate Sands in a squall. The alarm was sounded at daybreak by the lugger Eclipse, which sent eight men onto the brig, in the hope that she could be refloated at high tide. However the gale returned and they soon gave up hope of saving the ship. The small Margate boat was launched, but in their haste they did not secure their buoyancy tanks and were driven ashore, barely afloat, in Westgate Bay. Then the Friend of all Nations was launched but it too was overpowered by the storm and was driven onshore about a mile west of Margate. Eventually all those on the remains of the Samaritano were rescued by the Ramsgate lifeboat. The Friend was repaired and returned to service. She capsized during a rescue in January 1866 and her crew spent 85 minutes in the winter seas before they were rescued. She saved the lives of 38 men from 6 ships in the great storm of November 1877, but the damage inflicted during the rescues led to her retirement. Friend to all Nations Memorial to the Friend to all Nations, Margate The Friend of all Nations being unfit for further service, funds were raised for a replacement. This new boat, the Friend to all Nations, was also built at White's and arrived in Margate on 6 July 1878. The Friend to all Nations became famous in the great storm of 1897, which damaged much of Margate and destroyed the Switchback Railway.Margate Switchback Railway On the morning of 2 December 1897, thirteen men set out in the surfboat towards the struggling Persian Empire. However the Friend was hit by two waves in quick succession and capsized just off the Nayland Rock. Just four men made it to shore, of whom the medic Charles Troughton died on reaching land. The remaining nine were all beaten to a pulp on the rocks, except for Joseph Epps who was found, barely alive, underneath the capsized boat. Memorials were raised to the nine dead on the parade above Nayland Rock, and in Margate Cemetery. Apart from the mast and rigging, the boat itself was not badly damaged and returned to service. However she was lost on the night of 30 November 1898 while under tow in the Kentish Knock. She was recovered as far away as Great Yarmouth and repaired, but was not used again. 1899 boat A new boat was commissioned from White's, which was delivered in September 1899. This much larger boat - also called Friend to all Nations  required a crew of 15 and cost ¬£800. Improvements in lifeboats meant that she was largely restricted to local salvage work with the occasional rescue. One of her most notable rescues was that of 26 people from the sailing ship Marechal Suchet. In 1922 she was motorised following public donations. She continued in service at Margate until the Second World War, when she was requisitioned by the Royal Navy for service as a ship's tender in Chatham docks. After the war she moved to Falmouth and made her final journey in 1957 when Willi Froelich, an ex Luftwaffe war prisoner, tried to sail his family home to Germany. They got into difficulty near Ostend and were taken under tow, but the hawser snapped. After drifting for a while, the surfboat broke her bow in rough seas and sank.

She was the first woman to hold the office. A Democrat, Anderson served in various positions in the city and county and the state. She was the first Hawaii State Director of Budget and Finance. Early life Anderson attended the University of California in Los Angeles and, after moving to Hawaii with her family, graduated from the University of Hawaii at Manoa in 1950 with a bachelor's degree in psychology. Anderson married Clifford F. Anderson, a retired Honolulu Police Department major. She and her husband raised three children. After working for Hawaiian Telephone Company, the predecessor of the present-day Hawaiian Telcom, Anderson began public service in various state agencies. She found herself as the state's first budget and finance director under Governor George Ariyoshi. Mayor of Honolulu In 1980, Anderson defeated popular incumbent Frank Fasi with seventy percent of the vote. With the unpredicted surprise landslide victory against Fasi and his notoriously powerful machine, that year Anderson was named Hawaii Business Magazine \\"Woman of the Year 1980\\". Anderson served a single term at Honolulu Hale, taking office on January 2, 1981 and leaving office in 1985. Anderson's tenure as mayor was highlighted by her promise to continue development of the island of Oahu but with fiscal responsibility. Anderson was a member of the United States Conference of Mayors, an organization of mayors of United States cities with populations of 30,000 people or more. Cabinet Prominent members of Anderson's administration included Bob Awana as administrative director and chief of staff, later chief of staff to Linda Lingle, the first Hawaii Republican governor after forty years of Democrat dominance in the state. Awana helped run Anderson's failed re-election campaign against Fasi. Anderson appointed Andy Chang as managing director of Honolulu. Chang would continue to serve the city and county in various capacities after Anderson's departure from office. Honolulu Area Rail Rapid Transit Anderson's vow of fiscal responsibility was maintained in her cancellation of the Honolulu Area Rail Rapid Transit project, which was planned in the 1970s and close to construction approval. Popularly known as HART, the project in its original form would have built a heavy rail system with twenty-three miles of track featuring twenty-one stations from Pearl City in central Oahu to Hawaii Kai in East Oahu. In addition to millions to be invested by the city and county, millions of dollars in grants earmarked for HART were returned by Anderson. She declined US$5.75 million from the Federal government of the United States saying, \\"Why spend five million dollars on a system that won't be built?\\" Achieving national attention, Anderson defended her position by arguing the long-term costs to taxpayers for such an expensive project, especially after U.S. President Ronald Reagan announced elimination of Federal public transit funding in the country and the ongoing need for more funding for Interstate H-3 construction. She rather argued in favor of smaller, incremental improvements to the bus system. With growing development leading to increased traffic congestion on Oahu, the city and county continued to make public transit a focus of public debate during Anderson and Fasi's tenures. On October 6, 1981, Anderson announced she hoped to study the San Diego Trolley, a system funded with gas taxes. Both Anderson and Fasi continued to modernize TheBus but a rail system was never approved. It wasn't until the 2000s that Honolulu agreed to a similar, more expensive project under the leadership of the mayor, Mufi Hannemann. Political defeats Anderson once again stood for election as mayor and was defeated by Fasi, who had switched his political affiliation from Democrat to Republican, so as to avoid being knocked out of the Democratic primary by Anderson. Anderson subsequently sought a political comeback by seeking the nomination of her party for lieutenant governor in 1986. Anderson lost the primary election to state senator Ben Cayetano, who later served alongside Hawaii Governor John Waihee before becoming governor himself. Popular culture Perry and Price In 1983, KSSK-FM reformatted its morning programming pairing Michael W. Perry and Larry Price, who became two of the most popular personalities and one of the most popular radio news programs in Hawaii. Anderson was a regular listener and, a sign of Perry and Price's growing influence, was the first major person to call the show during the broadcast, in effect signaling how relevant they were to local culture and politics. Anderson called the radio hosts, angry about their comments over a political issue. The Honolulu Star-Bulletin published the account on August 27, 1998: Since Anderson's initial call, every Mayor of Honolulu and Governor of Hawaii has appeared on the morning Perry and Price program via telephone to comment or discuss various cultural and political issues and current events. Women in politics Interested in her role as first woman to become Mayor of Honolulu, the Hawaii Kai Sun Press asked Anderson to comment on women in politics. Published on June 1, 1983, Anderson said, \\"There is no way that we're going to change some of the discriminatory activities that go on toward women unless we do get them involved\\".

Such individual fish are said to be ciguatoxic. Symptoms may include diarrhea, vomiting, numbness, itchiness, sensitivity to hot and cold, dizziness, and weakness. The onset of symptoms varies with the amount of toxin eaten from half an hour to up to two days. The diarrhea may last for up to four days. Some symptoms typically remain for a few weeks to months. Heart difficulties such as slow heart rate and low blood pressure may also occur. The specific toxins involved are ciguatoxin and maitotoxin. They are originally made by a small marine organism, Gambierdiscus toxicus, that grow on and around coral reefs in tropical and subtropical waters. These are eaten by herbivorous fish which in turn are eaten by larger carnivorous fish. The toxins become more concentrated as they move up the food chain. The fish most often implicated include barracuda, grouper, moray eel, amberjack, sea bass, and sturgeon. Diagnosis is based on a person's symptoms together with having recently eaten fish. If a number of those who eat the same fish develop symptoms the diagnosis becomes more likely. If some of the fish they had previously eaten is available this can also be tested to confirm the diagnosis. Preventive efforts include not eating reef fish, not eating high- risk fish such as barracuda, and not eating fish liver, roe, or fish heads. Ciguatoxin has no taste or smell, and cannot be destroyed by conventional cooking. There is no specific treatment for ciguatera fish poisoning once it occurs. Mannitol may be considered, but the evidence supporting its use is not very strong. Gabapentin or amitriptyline may be used to treat some of the symptoms. The Centers for Disease Control estimates that around 50,000 cases occur globally each year. Other estimates suggest up to 500,000 cases per year. It is the most frequent seafood poisoning. It occurs most commonly in the Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, and the Caribbean Sea between the latitudes of 35¬∞N and 35¬∞S. The risk of the condition appears to be increasing due to coral reef deterioration and increasing trade in seafood. The risk of death from poisoning is less than 1 in 1,000. Descriptions of the condition date back to at least 1511. The current name came into use in 1787. Signs and symptoms Hallmark symptoms of ciguatera in humans include gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and neurological effects. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, usually followed by neurological symptoms such as headaches, muscle aches, paresthesia, numbness of extremities, mouth and lips, reversal of hot and cold sensation, ataxia, vertigo, and hallucinations. Severe cases of ciguatera can also result in cold allodynia, which is a burning sensation on contact with cold. Neurological symptoms can persist and ciguatera poisoning is occasionally misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis. Cardiovascular symptoms include bradycardia, tachycardia, hypotension, hypertension, orthostatic tachycardia, exercise intolerance, and rhythm disorders. Death from the condition can occur, but is very rare. Dyspareunia and other ciguatera symptoms have developed in otherwise healthy males and females following sexual intercourse with partners suffering ciguatera poisoning, signifying that the toxin may be sexually transmitted. Diarrhea and facial rashes have been reported in breastfed infants of poisoned mothers, suggesting that ciguatera toxins migrate into breast milk. The symptoms can last from weeks to years, and in extreme cases as long as 20 years, often leading to long-term disability. Most people do recover slowly over time. Cause Gambierdiscus toxicus is the primary dinoflagellate responsible for the production of a number of similar polyether toxins, including ciguatoxin, maitotoxin, gambieric acid and scaritoxin, as well as the long-chain alcohol palytoxin.Faust, MA and Gulledge RA. Identifying Harmful Marine Dynoflagellates. Smithsonian Institution, Contributions from the United States National Herbarium. Volume 42:1-144. 2002.National Office for Harmful Algal Blooms, Ciguatera Fish Poisoning. Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Other dinoflagellates that may cause ciguatera include Prorocentrum spp., Ostreopsis spp., Coolia monotis, Thecadinium spp. and Amphidinium carterae.National Office for Harmful Algal Blooms, Ciguatera Fish Poisoning: Causative organisms:. Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on a person's symptoms together with having recently eaten fish. If a number of those who eat the same fish have symptoms the diagnosis becomes more likely. If some of the fish they had previously eaten is available this can also be tested to confirm the diagnosis. Other potential causes such as paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP), scombrotoxin fish poisoning, and pufferfish poisoning should be excluded. The reversal of hot and cold sensations is an occasional symptom of CFP that may help differentiate it from intestinal \\"flu\\". Treatment There is no effective treatment or antidote for ciguatera poisoning. The mainstay of treatment is supportive care. There is some evidence that calcium channel blockers like nifedipine and verapamil are effective in treating some of the symptoms that remain after the initial sickness passes, such as poor circulation and shooting pains through the chest. These symptoms are due to vasoconstriction caused by maitotoxin. Ciguatoxin lowers the threshold for opening voltage-gated sodium channels in synapses of the nervous system. Opening a sodium channel causes depolarization, which could sequentially cause paralysis, heart contraction, and changing the senses of hot and cold. Some medications such as amitriptyline may reduce some symptoms, such as fatigue and paresthesia, although benefit does not occur in every case. Mannitol Mannitol was once used for poisoning after one study reported symptom reversal. Follow-up studies in animals and case reports in humans also found benefit from mannitol. However, a randomized, double-blind clinical trial found no difference between mannitol and normal saline. Despite this its use may still be considered. Epidemiology The current estimated global incidence annually is 20,000 to 50,000 people, though a large number of cases are believed to go unreported. Due to the limited habitats of ciguatoxin- producing microorganisms, ciguatera is common only in subtropical and tropical waters, particularly the Pacific and Caribbean, and usually is associated with fish caught in tropical reef waters. Exportation of reef fish, as well as tourism, often account for cases that develop in other regions. Ciguatoxin is found in over 400 species of reef fish. Avoiding consumption of all reef fish is the only sure way to avoid exposure. Imported fish served in restaurants may contain the toxin and produce illness which often goes unexplained by physicians unfamiliar with the symptoms of a tropical toxin. Ciguatoxin can also occur in farm-raised salmon. Furthermore, species substitution, labeling a reef fish as a non-reef fish at restaurants and retail, can complicate efforts by consumers to avoid ciguatera. 20th and 21st centuries *In 1994, Nobel Prize winning novelist Saul Bellow nearly died from Ciguatera after eating red snapper on vacation in St. Martin, fictionalized in his last novel Ravelstein.Leader, Zachary, The Life of Saul Bellow: Love and Strife 1965-2005, p. 528. *In 2007, ten people in St. Louis, Missouri developed the disease after eating imported fish. *In February 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) traced several outbreaks to the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary in the northern Gulf of Mexico, near the Texas- Louisiana shoreline. The FDA advised seafood processors that ciguatera poisoning was reasonably likely to occur from eating several species of fish caught as far as from the sanctuary. *From August 2010 to July 2011, there were eight outbreaks of Ciguatera fish poisoning in New York City. Outbreaks were linked to barracuda and grouper purchased at a fish market in Queens, New York. *In the first quarter of 2012, two restaurants in Lanzarote, Canary Islands are thought to have been the source of ciguatera poisoning, leading to new fishing regulations issued 18 April 2012. The first outbreak was reported in February 2012\\\\. Diners suffered with vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain several hours after eating amberjack. The second case was in early April affecting six people who live in Lanzarote and had all eaten amberjack at a local restaurant. *In March 2014, nine people were hospitalised near Macksville, New South Wales, Australia after a recreational fisherman caught a 55 lb Spanish Mackerel (Scomberomorus commerson) off Scott's Head (NSW) and then shared it among his friends and family. *In April 2015, fourteen crew members of a potash ship were hospitalized in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada after consuming tropical fish obtained from international waters. After the incident, Marine Catering Services issued a reminder to seafarers that the UK Food Act makes it illegal for crews to fish for food from their vessels. *In September 2016, a British holidaymaker died while on honeymoon in Mexico after consuming fish contaminated with the algae that causes ciguatera poisoning. During October 2016, more than 100 people suffered from ciguatera poisoning after eating fish heads supplied by an export firm in Mangalore, India. History Ciguatera was first described by one of the surgeon's mates, William Anderson, on the crew of in 1774. (The New York Times incorrectly gives William Anderson's first name as John.) Researchers suggest that ciguatera outbreaks caused by warm climatic conditions in part propelled the migratory voyages of Polynesians between 1000 and 1400AD. Folk tales In Northern Australia, where ciguatera is a common problem, two different folk science methods are widely believed to detect whether fish harbor significant ciguatoxin. The first method is that flies are supposed not to land on contaminated fish. The second is that cats will either refuse to eat or vomit/display symptoms after eating contaminated fish. A third, less common testing method involves putting a silver coin under the scales of the suspect fish. If the coin turns black, according to the theory, it is contaminated. On Grand Cayman and other islands the locals will test barracuda by placing a piece of the fish on the ground and allowing ants to crawl on it. If the ants do not avoid the flesh and will eat it, then the fish is deemed safe. In Dominican Republic, another common belief is that during months whose names do not include the letter \\"R\\" (May through August), it is not recommended to eat certain kinds of fish, because they are more likely to be infected by the ciguatera toxin. The validity of many of these tests has been scientifically rejected.  Folk remedies  Leaves of Heliotropium foertherianum (Boraginaceae) ‚Äì also known as octopus bush ‚Äì are used in many Pacific islands as a traditional medicine to treat ciguatera fish poisoning. Senescent octopus bush leaves contain rosmarinic acid and derivatives, which are known for their antiviral, antibacterial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. Rosmarinic acid may remove the ciguatoxins from their sites of action, as well as being an anti-inflammatory. An account of ciguatera poisoning from a linguistics researcher living on Malakula island, Vanuatu, indicates the local treatment: \\"We had to go with what local people told us: avoid salt and any seafood. Eat sugary foods. And they gave us a tea made from the roots of ferns growing on tree trunks. I don't know if any of that helped, but after a few weeks, the symptoms faded away\\". Various Caribbean folk and ritualistic treatments originated in Cuba and nearby islands. The most common old-time remedy involves bed rest subsequent to a guanabana juice enema. In Puerto Rico, natives drink a tea made from mangrove buttons, purportedly high in B vitamins, to flush the toxic symptoms from the system. There has never been a funded study of these treatments. Other folk treatments range from directly porting and bleeding the gastrointestinal tract to \\"cleansing\\" the diseased with a dove during a Santer√≠a ritual.

It is bounded by Cape Cod at the eastern tip of Massachusetts in the southwest and by Cape Sable Island at the southern tip of Nova Scotia in the northeast. The gulf includes the entire coastlines of the U.S. states of New Hampshire and Maine, as well as Massachusetts north of Cape Cod, and the southern and western coastlines of the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, respectively. The gulf was named for the adjoining English colonial Province of Maine, which was in turn likely named by early explorers after the province of Maine in France. Massachusetts Bay, Penobscot Bay, Passamaquoddy Bay, and the Bay of Fundy are included within the Gulf of Maine system; as such, the Gulf of Maine is also home to the highest tidal variations on the planet (see Bay of Fundy for further information). Geography and hydrography The Gulf of Maine is a roughly rectangular depression with a surface area of around , enclosed to the west and north by the North American mainland and communicating with the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast. The region's glaciation by the Laurentide Ice Sheet stripped sedimentary soil away from the coastline, leaving a shore that is predominantly rocky and scenic, lacking the sandy beaches found to the south along the Eastern Seaboard. The only significant coastal developments are located in the Boston, Portsmouth, Portland and Saint John metropolitan areas. The underwater features of the seabed sculpted during the lower sea levels of the ice ages make the gulf a semi-enclosed sea bounded to the south and east by underwater banks. Georges Bank in particular, on its southern end, shelters the gulf from the Gulf Stream. Gulf of Maine waters are more strongly influenced by the Labrador Current, making the gulf waters significantly colder and more nutrient-rich than those found to the south. Undersea valleys in the central basin can reach depths of , while undersea mountains rise up from the sea floor, almost reaching the surface in some locations, or even exceeding it, creating islands. There are three major basins contained within the Gulf of Maine: Wilkinson Basin to the west, Jordan Basin in the northeast, and Georges Basin in the south, which are isolated from each other beneath the isobath. Georges Basin, just north of Georges Bank, is the deepest of the three at just over and generates a pocket at the end of the Northeast Channel, a deep fissure between Georges Bank and Browns Bank, the southwestern edge of the Scotian Shelf. The Northeast Channel is the major channel between the Gulf and the rest of the Northwest Atlantic. A secondary, shallower connection to the rest of the Atlantic is the Great South Channel, located between Georges Bank and the Nantucket Shoals. Ecology The cold waters, extreme tidal mixing, and diverse bottom of the gulf make it one of the most productive marine environments in the North Atlantic, and it furnishes habitat for many diverse species, including most notably haddock, the Acadian redfish (Sebastes fasciatus), the Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) and the American lobster (Homarus americanus), which grows to famously large sizes in the gulf. The waters of the Gulf of Maine system, particularly at the boundary with the Bay of Fundy, are also home to the summering grounds for many different bird and whale species, most notably the highly endangered North Atlantic right whale.https://www.npr.org/2019/10/06/766401296/the-gulf-of-maine-is-warming- and-its-whales-are-disappearing The gulf was home to the sea mink until its extinction in the late 1800s. Due to rapid rising of water temperatures in the Gulf of Maine, it has become too warm for cod. This, along with past overfishing, has helped push stocks towards collapse and hampered its recovery despite deep reductions in the number of fish caught, according to a study conducted by the Gulf of Maine Research Institute. Traditional calculations \\"consistently over-estimated the abundance of cod.\\" From 2004, temperatures rose by more than per year, culminating in an ocean heat wave in the northwest Atlantic in 2012-13. Watershed A number of states and provinces along the North American coast drain into the Gulf of Maine. Much of that region is depicted here. The watershed of the gulf encompasses an area of , including all of Maine, 70% of New Hampshire, 56% of New Brunswick, 41% of Massachusetts, and 36% of Nova Scotia. The watershed also includes a small southern portion of the Canadian province of Quebec, less than 1% of the province's area. Significant rivers that drain into the Gulf include, from east to west, the Annapolis, Shubenacadie, Salmon, Petitcodiac, Saint John, Magaguadavic, St. Croix, Penobscot, Kennebec, Saco, Piscataqua, Merrimack and Charles rivers; the Saint John and Penobscot having the greatest discharge. History and political significance Hampton Beach, New Hampshire, in mid- September 2004 The gulf's relative proximity to Europe among locations on the opposite side of the Atlantic made it an early destination for European colonization. French settlers founded a settlement on St. Croix Island in 1604. English settlers founded the Popham Colony on an island in the Kennebec River in 1607, the same year as the Jamestown settlement, followed by the Plymouth Colony on the shores of Massachusetts Bay in 1620. In the 1960s and 1970s there was a dispute between Canada and the United States over fishing and other resource rights in the Gulf of Maine, specifically the Georges Bank region. This dispute was taken to the International Court of Justice, which delineated a maritime boundary through the gulf in 1984. The two nations continue to disagree on the sovereignty of Machias Seal Island and the waters surrounding it in the northeastern part of the gulf. In recognition of the gulf's importance to marine habitat, both nations currently maintain complementary embargoes against offshore oil and gas exploration activities on Georges Bank in the southern part of the gulf.

The lifeboat Solomon Browne, based at the Penlee Lifeboat Station near Mousehole, went to the aid of the vessel Union Star after its engines failed in heavy seas. After the lifeboat had rescued four people, both vessels were lost with all hands; in all, sixteen people died including eight volunteer lifeboatmen. MV Union Star The MV Union Star was launched in Ringk√∏bing in Denmark just a few days before it was wrecked on the Cornish coast. A mini-bulk carrier registered in Dublin, Ireland, it sailed to IJmuiden in the Netherlands to collect a cargo of fertiliser for its maiden voyage to Arklow in Ireland. It was carrying a crew of five: Captain Henry Morton; Mate James Whittaker, Engineer George Sedgwick, Crewman Anghostino Verressimo, and Crewman Manuel Lopes. Also on board was the captain's family (his wife Dawn with teenage stepdaughters Sharon and Deanne) who had been picked up at an unauthorised call at Brightlingsea in Essex. Near the south coast of Cornwall, east of the Wolf Rock, the new ship's engines failed. The crew was unable to restart them but did not make a mayday call. Assistance was offered by a tug, the Noord Holland, under the Lloyd's Open Form salvage contract but Morton initially refused the offer, later accepting after consulting his owners. Winds were gusting at up to ‚Äì hurricane, force 12 on the Beaufort scale ‚Äì with waves up to high. The powerless ship was blown across Mount's Bay towards the rocks of Boscawen Cove, near Lamorna. Rescue attempts FAA Sea King helicopter As the ship was close to shore, the Coastguard at Falmouth summoned a Royal Navy Sea King helicopter from 820 Naval Air Squadron (who were providing cover for 771 Naval Air Squadron), RNAS Culdrose. It used the call sign \\"Rescue 80\\" during the mission. The aircraft (airframe XZ574) was flown that night by United States Navy exchange-pilot LCDR Russell Smith, assisted by Lt Steve Marlow, S/Lt Kenneth Doherty and Leading Aircrewman Martin Kennie of the Royal Navy.Discussion on Aviation Forum They were unable to winch anyone off the ship as the wind was too violent. RNLB Solomon Browne The original Penlee Lifeboat Station, from which Solomon Browne was launched The Coastguard had difficulties contacting the secretary of the nearest lifeboat station, Penlee Lifeboat Station at Mousehole on the west side of the bay. They eventually contacted Coxswain Trevelyan Richards and asked him to put the lifeboat on standby in case the helicopter rescue failed. He summoned the lifeboat's volunteer crew and picked seven men to accompany him in the lifeboat. They were Second Coxswain/Mechanic Stephen Madron, Assistant Mechanic Nigel Brockman, Emergency Mechanic John Blewett, and crewmembers Charlie Greenhaugh, Kevin Smith, Barrie Torrie and Gary Wallis. Neil Brockman, the son of Nigel Brockman, got to the lifeboat station on time, but was turned down for the trip by Trevelyan Richards, who was reluctant to take out two members of the same family that night. The lifeboat launched at 8:12 pm and headed out through the storm to the drifting coaster. The lifeboat was the RNLB Solomon Browne, a wooden Watson-class boat built in 1960 and capable of . The lifeboat was named after Quaker Solomon Browne of Landrake following a bequest presented by his daughters. After it had made several attempts to get alongside, four people managed to jump across; the captain's family and one of the men were apparently safe. The lifeboat radioed that 'we‚Äôve got four off', but that was the last heard from either vessel. Lt Cdr Smith USN, the pilot of the rescue helicopter, later reported that: > The greatest act of courage that I have ever seen, and am ever likely to > see, was the penultimate courage and dedication shown by the Penlee [crew] > when it manoeuvred back alongside the casualty in over 60 ft breakers and > rescued four people shortly after the Penlee had been bashed on top of the > casualty's hatch covers. They were truly the bravest eight men I've ever > seen, who were also totally dedicated to upholding the highest standards of > the RNLI. Other lifeboats Lifeboats were summoned from , and to try to help their colleagues from Penlee. The Sennen Cove Lifeboat found it impossible to make headway round Land's End. The Lizard Lifeboat found a serious hole in its hull when it finally returned to its slipway after a fruitless search. Aftermath The memorial garden at Penlee In the aftermath of the disaster, wreckage from the Solomon Browne was found along the shore, and the Union Star lay capsized onto the rocks, west of Tater Du Lighthouse. Some, but not all, of the 16 bodies were eventually recovered. The inquiry into the disaster determined that the loss of the Union Star and its crew was because of: # the irreparable failure of the ship's engines due to contamination of fuel by sea water while off a dangerous lee shore; # the extreme severity of the weather, wind and sea; and # the capsize of the vessel on or shortly after stranding. The loss of the Solomon Browne was: > in consequence of the persistent and heroic endeavours by the coxswain and > his crew to save the lives of all from the Union Star. Such heroism enhances > the highest traditions of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in whose > service they gave their lives. Coxswain Trevelyan Richards was posthumously awarded the Royal National Lifeboat Institution's gold medal, while the remainder of the crew were all posthumously awarded bronze medals. The station itself was awarded a gold medal service plaque. The disaster prompted a massive public appeal for the benefit of the village of Mousehole which raised over ¬£3 million (equivalent to ¬£ in ), although there was an outcry when the government tried to tax the donations. Two nights before the disaster, Charlie Greenhaugh, who in civilian life was the landlord of the Ship Inn on the quayside in Mousehole, had turned on the village's Christmas lights. After the storm the lights were left off but three days later his widow Mary asked for them to be repaired and lit again. The village has been lit up each December since then, but on the anniversary of the disaster they are turned off at 8:00 pm for an hour as an act of remembrance. A plaque was also erected on the Ship Inn on behalf of the tenants, managers, directors and employees of the St Austell Brewery, the pub's owner. Within a day of the disaster enough people from Mousehole had volunteered to form a new lifeboat crew. In 1983 a new lifeboat station (still known as 'Penlee') was opened nearby at Newlyn where a faster, larger boat could be kept moored afloat in the harbour. Neil Brockman later became the coxswain of the station's lifeboat. The old boathouse at Penlee Point with its slipway is kept the same as it was when the lifeboat launched and a memorial garden was created beside it in 1985 to commemorate the crew of the Solomon Browne. The Sea King helicopter involved in the rescue attempt, Airframe XZ574, is today preserved at the Fleet Air Arm Museum at RNAS Yeovilton, primarily because it had been flown by Prince Andrew, Duke of York during the Falklands War. Cultural references GWR train 802008 RNLB Solomon Browne carries the names of the crew The disaster has been the subject of several songs. The English folk singer and songwriter Seth Lakeman wrote the song \\"Solomon Browne\\", which appears on his 2008 album Poor Man's Heaven. The CD reissue of the Anthony Phillips' album Invisible Men includes \\"The Ballad of Penlee\\" about the incident. Paul Sirman, a Kentish folk artist who specialises in songs of the sea recorded the incident in his song \\"Solomon Browne\\" which appears on his album One For All. Kimber's Men, a sea shanty group, recorded \\"Don't Take The Heroes\\" on their CD of the same name. Local band Bates Motel based in Hayle included a song \\"The Last Wave\\", about the disaster on their album Anorak. In 2015, Cornish-American singer-songwriter Jim Wearne's album Half Alive in Wallaroo featured the track \\"The Boys of Penlee\\", written by fellow Cornish bard Craig Weatherhill, and featuring Weatherhill playing mellotron whose haunting choir sound ends the song with the line \\"For those in peril on the sea\\", from the popular sailors' hymn. Simon Dobson wrote a test piece for brass band entitled \\"Penlee\\" about the incident. In 2017 The Wareham Whalers Shanty Crew from Wareham in Dorset presented their new tribute song \\"The Shout\\" at the Shanty Festival in Falmouth, Cornwall. In 2018 Rev. Jim Benton-Evans wrote the song \\"The Bravest Eight\\", it was debuted on Liskeard Radio on 19 December at 8pm, all profits from its release will go to the RNLI. Neil Oliver devotes a chapter to the disaster in his 2008 book Amazing Tales for Making Men out of Boys. It also features in his book The Story of The British Isles in 100 Places.

The work was first published in Italian at Florence in 1645 and 1646 in three folio volumes. Among other things, it is remarkable for its inclusion of a proposal for the construction of a navy in five rates (sizes) which Dudley designed and described. It was reprinted in Florence in a two volume folio edition in 1661 without the charts of the first edition. Scope Dell'Arcano del Mare: chart of Portugal (Florence, 1646) The six-part work covered navigation, shipbuilding and astronomy, with 130 maps in two volumes (nos. 2 and 6) . Unlike the vast majority of his contemporaries, Dudley's maps are all his own and were not copied from other mapmakers. They have an instantly recognisable style, closer to the pre-17th-century manuscript portolan charts than the richly decorated maps of Mercator, Hondius and Blaeu. Style The distinctive Baroque style of Dudley's charts is in part attributable to the elegant engraving of Antonio Francesco Lucini. Later map-makers chose not to copy Dudley's style and so it remains unique in the annals of cartography. The engraving by Antonio Francesco Lucini, who stated that he spent 12 years and used 5,000 pounds of copper to produce the plates, is of exceptional quality, as is the calligraphy. Individual maps Carta Particolare Che Mostra Il Capo Buona Speranza \\"Carta Particolare Che Mostra Il Capo Buona Speranza\\" is a very large sea chart of southwest Africa from Cape Fria to Cape of Good Hope, including Tristan da Cunha. Carta Quarta Generale di Europa \\"Carta Quarta Generale di Europa\\", 1646 is one of the larger scale, generalised (Carta Generale) maps and shows the West coast of France, southward from La Rochelle, and the Northern coast of Spain. This is the least ornate of the styles adopted by Dudley with no adornment other than the cartouche and a compass rose and fairly plain calligraphy. Smaller scale maps Four additional maps represent the majority of the smaller scale, more specific (Carta Particolare) maps and include sailing ships, notes on prevailing winds and currents and more stylised calligraphy. Carta Particolare della Costa Australe scoperta dalla Ollandesia \\"Carta Particolare della Costa Australe scoperta dalla Ollandesia\\", 1646. According to Tooley, this map is the first separately printed map of Australia and is consequently of great value. It shows, in addition to the west side of the Cape York peninsula, much of the island of New Guinea. By labelling the Torres Strait \\"Golfo Incognito\\" Dudley leaves open the question of whether New Guinea is connected to the Southern continent. Carta Particolare della Rio d' Amazone con la costa sin al fiume Maranhan \\"Carta Particolare della Rio d' Amazone con la costa sin al fiume Maranhan\\" of 1646 shows the mouth of the Amazon River. Carta particolare che comincia con l' Isola di S. Tomaso o Tome....Clara e finisce con Il c. d' Aldeas \\"Carta particolare che comincia con l' Isola di S. Tomaso o Tome....Clara e finisce con Il c. d' Aldeas\\". This map of the shoreline of the African Congo includes an elegant cartouche, and islands off the coastline. Carta particolare della Brasilia Australe che comincia dala Poro del Spirito Santo e finisce con il capo Bianco \\"Carta particolare della Brasilia Australe che comincia dala Poro del Spirito Santo e finisce con il capo Bianco\\" reveals a strip of the southern Brazil coastline and includes S√£o Paulo and the area later to become Rio de Janeiro. Noted for some of the most peculiar representations of mountains near the coastline found on any Dudley map. French Guiana, Guyana and a small portion of Brazil. Untitled, (N-E South America) The seventh map is one of only two in the atlas which have no title but instead dedications to the Grand Duke of Tuscany and, in this case, the Grand Duchess, Dudley's patrons. This is another double page map and probably comes from the 1646 edition. These two maps are probably different because they are the only ones where Dudley was able to use his own observations as they cover the North East coast of South America, the area he visited in 1594. This map shows the coasts of French Guiana, Guyana and a small portion of Brazil. Considerably more elaborate than the others, this map includes soundings and numerous illustrations, namely: two ships, a canoe, two magnificent sea monsters, a (?) cougar and two natives. It also has a legend stating that Monoa ‚Äì more often known as El Dorado is only 12 days journey up- river from the coast. References * Sir Robert Dudley. (2009). In Encyclop√¶dia Britannica.

Isbell, USN (September 22, 1899 ‚Äì March 19, 1945) was a United States Navy officer and Naval Aviator who was killed near the end of World War II. Early life and career Isbell was born September 22, 1899, in Oto, Iowa. Raised in Logan, Iowa, he was appointed to the U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland in 1917, graduating and being commissioned as an ensign in 1920. He was graduated a year early because of accelerated training received during World War I. He served in various vessels in the Pacific until 1923, at which time he was ordered to duty in flight instruction. He received his wings and appointment as Naval Aviator (Seaplane) on January 11, 1924. From 1924 to 1926 his duty involved flying in various categories, the most notable being on the Navy's first carrier, USS Langley. From 1926 to 1929 he undertook the postgraduate course in ordnance at Annapolis, Maryland. Isbell's duty from 1929 until 1940 when he was promoted to the rank of commander was principally concerned with flying and ordnance. He served on the original carrier Lexington, placed the carrier Ranger in commission and served on the staff of the Commander Aircraft, attached to the Battle Force. At Naval Air Station Pensacola, Isbell assumed command of Training Squadron VN-4D8 in September 1937 and Training Squadron VN-2D8 in January 1939. World War II service Prior to the actual entrance of the United States in World War II, Captain Isbell was actively engaged in operations vitally connected with the expansion of US bases. He was awarded the Air Medal for \\"meritorious achievement while participating in aerial flight as Commanding Officer of Patrol Squadron 54 during the initial selection and survey of US Army and Navy Bases in Newfoundland in September and October 1940.\\" Isbell was promoted to captain in 1942 while in command of the Naval Air Station, Sitka, Alaska. In 1943, Isbell took command of the USS Card, an escort carrier, for which duty he was awarded the Navy Distinguished Service Medal for a notable record of German submarine sinkings in the Central Atlantic convoy routes during World War II. Following his successful command of the Card, Isbell was on duty with the Tenth Fleet, Anti-submarine Warfare, Navy Department, Washington, D.C., for a year. He then reported to the Pacific Fleet for assignment as Commanding Officer of USS Yorktown. It was while taking passage on USS Franklin prior to assuming command that Isbell lost his life when the carrier was hit by bombs from a Japanese plane off Okinawa on March 19, 1945. Namesake and honors The destroyer USS Arnold J. Isbell (DD-869) was named in Captain Isbell's honor. In addition, the Captain Arnold Jay Isbell Trophy, a US Navy award to recognize superior air antisubmarine warfare (ASW) squadrons, is also named in his honor.

To be a part of the webring, each site has a common navigation bar; it contains links to the previous and next site. By selecting next (or previous) repeatedly, the user will eventually reach the site they started at; this is the origin of the term webring. However, the select-through route around the ring is usually supplemented by a central site with links to all member sites; this prevents the ring from breaking completely if a member site goes offline. A webring is managed from one website which is able to omit the websites that have dropped out or are no longer reachable. The advantage of a webring is that if the user is interested in the topic on one website, they can quickly connect to another website on the same topic.ICT Roger Crawford - Heinemann IGCSE - Chapter 7 page 192 Webrings usually have a moderator who decides which pages to include in the webring. After approval, webmasters add their pages to the ring by 'linking in' to the ring; this requires adding the necessary HTML or JavaScript to their site. Sites usually join a webring in order to receive traffic from related sites. When used to improve search engine rankings, webrings can be considered a search engine optimization technique. Webrings are mainly viewed as a relic of the early web of the 1990s. When the primary site that managed web rings, webring.org was acquired by Yahoo, \\"ring masters\\" lost access to their webrings and the web ring hubs were replaced by a Yahoo page. By the time Yahoo stopped controlling webring.org in 2001, search engines had become good enough that web rings were no longer as useful. The webring.org site was still active in the mid-2010s. WebRing.com Denis Howe started EUROPa (Expanding Unidirectional Ring Of Pages) at Imperial College in 1994. The idea developed further when Giraldo Hierro conceptualized a central CGI (Common Gateway Interface) script to enhance functionality. Sage Weil developed such a script in May 1994. Weil's script gained popularity, pushing Weil in June 1995 to form a company called WebRing. In 1997, Weil sold WebRing to Starseed, Inc. In 1998 Starseed was acquired by GeoCities, who made no major changes to the system. Just a few months later, in early 1999, Yahoo! bought GeoCities, and eighteen months after the acquisition, on September 5, 2000, Yahoo! unveiled a fully overhauled WebRing, known as Yahoo! WebRing. Although Yahoo!'s implementation was meant to streamline the way the rings were managed and provide a more consistent interface for all rings, many of these changes were unpopular with ringmasters accustomed to the older system which gave them more flexibility. On April 15, 2001, Yahoo! pulled their support of WebRing, leaving it in the hands of one technician from the original WebRing, Timothy Killeen. He unveiled a WebRing free of Yahoo! influence on October 12, 2001. In the years since this change, many of the features which had been stripped by Yahoo!, particularly customization options, were reimplemented into the WebRing system. On September 26, 2006, Webring Inc. announced a new WebRing Premium Membership Program. They have separated memberships into two types, WebRing 1.0 and WebRing 2.0. Sites that are part of WebRing 1.0 will be limited to 50 webrings per URL. Existing 1.0 members can maintain more than 50, but can not add more. In conjunction with the premium membership program, WebRing introduced an affiliate program, in which webmasters earn money when others join webrings from their site; they earn an additional payment if the new member purchases a premium membership. In early October 2007, Webring was granted a trademark on \\"Webring\\" from the USA Trademark office. Also in that month, Yahoo's long partnership ended as Webring ownership repurchased Webring stock held by Yahoo, marking the first time since the late 1990s that Webring was again privately held.

The first \\"Alt-webring\\" first appeared in the Internet Archive in September 2006. Alt-webring.com has since closed and has been taken over by a domain squatter. Webringo A reborn website is Webringo.com, run as a hobby by the RingMaster. The first \\"webringo\\" first appeared in the Internet Archive in September 2006, but failed in September 2011.

Northern England is bordered by the Midlands to the south. It extends from the Anglo- Scottish border in the north to near the River Trent in the south, although precise definitions of its southern extent vary. Northern England approximately comprises three statistical regions: the North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber. These have a combined population of around 14.9 million as of the 2011 Census and an area of 37,331 km2 (14,414 sq mi). Northern England contains much of England's national parkland but also has large areas of urbanisation, including the conurbations of Greater Manchester, Merseyside, Teesside, Tyneside, Wearside, and South and West Yorkshire. The region has been controlled by many groups, from the Brigantes, the largest Brythonic kingdom of Great Britain, to the Romans, to Anglo-Saxons and Danes. After the Norman conquest in 1066, the Harrying of the North brought destruction. The area experienced Anglo-Scottish border fighting until the personal union of England and Scotland under the Stuarts, with some parts changing hands between England and Scotland many times. Many of the innovations of the Industrial Revolution began in Northern England, and its cities were the crucibles of many of the political changes that accompanied this social upheaval, from trade unionism to Manchester Capitalism. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the economy of the North was dominated by heavy industry such as weaving, shipbuilding, steel-making and mining. The deindustrialisation that followed in the second half of the 20th century hit Northern England hard, and many towns remain deprived compared with those in Southern England. Urban renewal projects and the transition to a service economy have resulted in strong economic growth in some parts of Northern England, but a definite North‚ÄìSouth divide remains both in the economy and the culture of England. Centuries of migration, invasion and labour have shaped Northern culture, and the region retains distinctive dialects, music and cuisine. Definitions For government and statistical purposes, Northern England is defined as the area covered by the three statistical regions of North East England, North West England and Yorkshire and the Humber. This area consists of the ceremonial counties of Cheshire, Cumbria, County Durham, East Riding of Yorkshire, Greater Manchester, Lancashire, Merseyside, Northumberland, North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, Tees Valley, Tyne and Wear and West Yorkshire, plus the unitary authority areas of North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire. This definition will be used in this article, except when otherwise stated. Other definitions use historic county boundaries, in which case the North is generally taken to comprise Cumberland, Northumberland, Westmorland, County Durham, Lancashire and Yorkshire, often supplemented by Cheshire, or are drawn without reference to human borders, using geographic features such as the River Mersey and River Trent. The Isle of Man is occasionally included in definitions of \\"the North\\" (for example, by the Survey of English Dialects, VisitBritain and BBC North West), although it is politically and culturally distinct from England. Some areas of Derbyshire, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire and Staffordshire have Northern characteristics and include satellites of Northern cities. Towns in the High Peak borough of Derbyshire are included in the Greater Manchester Built-Up Area, as villages and hamlets there such as Tintwistle, Crowden and Woodhead were formerly in Cheshire before local government boundary changes in 1974, due to their close proximity to the city of Manchester, and before this the borough was considered to be part of the Greater Manchester Statutory City Region. More recently, the Chesterfield, North East Derbyshire, Bolsover, and Derbyshire Dales districts have joined with districts of South Yorkshire to form the Sheffield City Region, along with the Bassetlaw District of Nottinghamshire, although for all other purposes these districts still remain in their respective East Midlands counties. The geographer Danny Dorling includes most of the West Midlands and part of the East Midlands in his definition of the North, claiming that \\"ideas of a midlands region add more confusion than light\\". Conversely, more restrictive definitions also exist, typically based on the extent of the historical Northumbria, which exclude Cheshire and Lincolnshire. Personal definitions of the North vary greatly and are sometimes passionately debated. When asked to draw a dividing line between North and South, Southerners tend to draw this line further south than Northerners do. From the Southern perspective, Northern England is sometimes defined jokingly as the area north of the Watford Gap between Northampton and Leicester ‚Äì a definition which would include much of the Midlands. Various cities and towns have been described as or promoted themselves as the \\"gateway to the North\\", including Crewe, Stoke-on-Trent, and Sheffield. For some in the northernmost reaches of England, the North starts somewhere in North Yorkshire around the River Tees ‚Äì the Yorkshire poet Simon Armitage suggests Thirsk, Northallerton or Richmond ‚Äì and does not include cities like Manchester and Leeds, nor the majority of Yorkshire. Northern England is not a homogeneous unit, and some have entirely rejected the idea that the North exists as a coherent entity, claiming that considerable cultural differences across the area overwhelm any similarities. Historic counties alt=A map of the historical counties of England, with Northern counties highlighted. The historic counties ceased to be used for any administrative purpose in 1899 but remain important to some people, notably for county cricket.  Geography Relief map of Northern England, showing the Pennines and river valleys.alt=A relief map of the Pennines Through the North of England run the Pennines, an upland chain sometimes referred to as \\"the backbone of England\\", which stretches from the Tyne Gap to the Peak District. Other uplands in the North include the Lake District with England's highest mountains, the Cheviot Hills adjoining the border with Scotland, and the North York Moors near the North Sea coastline. The geography of the North has been heavily shaped by the ice sheets of the Pleistocene era, which often reached as far south as the Midlands. Glaciers carved deep, craggy valleys in the central uplands, and, when they melted, deposited large quantities of fluvio-glacial material in lowland areas like the Cheshire and Solway Plains. On the eastern side of the Pennines, a former glacial lake forms the Humberhead Levels: a large area of fenland which drains into the Humber and which is very fertile and productive farmland. Scafell Pike, England's highest peak, alongside Wastwater, its deepest lake Much of the mountainous upland remains undeveloped, and of the ten national parks in England, five ‚Äì the Peak District, the Lake District, the North York Moors, the Yorkshire Dales, and Northumberland National Park ‚Äì are located partly or entirely in the North. The Lake District includes England's highest peak, Scafell Pike, which rises to , its largest lake, Windermere, and its deepest lake, Wastwater. Northern England is one of the most treeless areas in Europe, and to combat this the government plans to plant over 50 million trees in a new Northern Forest across the region. Urban sprawl in the southern Pennines and north east coast is clearly visible in night-time imagery. Vast urban areas have emerged along the coasts and rivers, and they run almost contiguously into each other in places. The needs of trade and industry have produced an almost continuous thread of urbanisation from the Wirral Peninsula to Doncaster, taking in the cities of Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, and Sheffield, with a population of at least 7.6 million. Uniquely for such a large urban belt in Europe, these cities are all recent; most of them started as scattered villages with no shared identity before the Industrial Revolution. On the east coast, trade fuelled the growth of major ports such as Kingston upon Hull and Newcastle upon Tyne, and the riverside conurbations of Teesside, Tyneside and Wearside became the largest towns in the North East. Northern England is now heavily urbanised: analysis by The Northern Way in 2006 found that 90% of the population of the North lived in one of its city regions: Liverpool, Central Lancashire, Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds, Hull and Humber Ports, Tees Valley and Tyne and Wear. As of the 2011 census, 86% of the Northern population lived in urban areas as defined by the Office for National Statistics, compared to 82% for England as a whole. Natural resources Peat is found in thick, plentiful layers across the Pennines and Scottish Borders, and there are many large coalfields, including the Great Northern, Lancashire and South Yorkshire Coalfields. Millstone grit, a distinctive coarse-grained rock used to make millstones, is widespread in the Pennines, and the variety of other rock types is reflected in the architecture of the region, such as the bright red sandstone seen in buildings in Chester, the cream-buff Yorkstone and the distinctive purple Doddington sandstone. These sandstones also mean that apart from the east coast, most of Northern England has very soft water, and this has influenced not just industry, but even the blends of tea enjoyed in the region.; ; Rich deposits of iron ore are found in Cumbria and the North East, and fluorspar and baryte are also plentiful in northern parts of the Pennines. Salt mining in Cheshire has a long history, and both remaining rock salt mines in Great Britain are in the North: Winsford Mine in Cheshire and Boulby Mine in North Yorkshire, which also produces half of the UK's potash. Climate upright=1.1 Northern England has a cool, wet oceanic climate with small areas of subpolar oceanic climate in the uplands.Calculated using data from WorldClim.org. Averaged across the entire region, Northern England is cooler, wetter and cloudier than England as a whole, and contains both England's coldest point (Cross Fell) and its rainiest point (Seathwaite Fell). Its temperature range and sunshine duration is similar to the UK average and it sees substantially less rainfall than Scotland or Wales. These averages disguise considerable variation across the region, due chiefly to the upland regions and adjacent seas. The prevailing winds across the British Isles are westerlies bringing moisture from the Atlantic Ocean; this means that the west coast frequently receives strong winds and heavy rainfall while the east coast lies in a rain shadow behind the Pennines. As a result, Teesside and the Northumbrian coast are the driest regions in the North, with around of rain per year, while parts of the Lake District receive over . Lowland regions in the more southern parts of Northern England such as Cheshire and South Yorkshire are the warmest, with average maximum July temperatures of over , while the highest points in the Pennines and Lake District reach only . The area has a reputation for cloud and fog ‚Äì especially along its east coast, which experiences a distinctive sea fog known as fret ‚Äì although the Clean Air Act 1956 and decline of heavy industry have seen sunshine duration increase in urban areas in recent years. Language and dialect English / ä/ isogloss.alt=A map of England, with isoglosses showing how different regions pronounce \\"sun\\" The English spoken today in the North has been shaped by the area's history, and some dialects retain features inherited from Old Norse and the local Celtic languages. Dialects spoken in the North include Cumbrian (Cumbria), Geordie (Tyneside), Lancashire (Lancashire), Mancunian (Manchester), Northumbrian (Northumberland and Durham), Pitmatic (former mining communities of Northumberland/County Durham), Scouse (Liverpool) and Tyke (Yorkshire). Linguists have attempted to define a Northern dialect area, corresponding to the area north of a line that begins at the Humber estuary and runs up the River Wharfe and across to the River Lune in north Lancashire. This area corresponds roughly to the sprachraum of the Old English Northumbrian dialect, although the linguistic elements that defined this area in the past, such as the use of doon instead of down and substitution of an ang sound in words that end -ong (lang instead of long), are now prevalent only in the more northern parts of the region. As speech has changed, there is little consensus on what defines a \\"Northern\\" accent or dialect. Northern English accents have not undergone the TRAP‚ÄìBATH split, and a common shibboleth to distinguish them from Southern ones is the Northern use of the short a (the near-open front unrounded vowel) in words such as bath and castle. On the opposite border, most Northern English accents can be distinguished from Scottish accents because they are non-rhotic, although a few rhotic Lancashire accents remain. Other features common to many Northern English accents are the absence of the FOOT‚ÄìSTRUT split (so put and putt are homophones), the reduction of the definite article the to a glottal stop (usually represented in writing as t or occasionally th, although it is often not pronounced as a /t/ sound) or its total elision, and the T-to-R rule that leads to the pronunciation of t as a rhotic consonant in phrases like get up (). The pronouns thou and thee survive in some Northern English dialects, although these are dying out outside very rural areas, and many dialects have an informal second-person plural pronoun: either ye (common in the North East) or yous (common in areas with historical Irish communities). Many dialects use me as a possessive (\\"me car\\") and some treat us likewise (\\"us cars\\") or use the alternative wor (\\"wor cars\\"). Possessive pronouns are also used to mark the names of relatives in speech (for example, a relative called Joan would be referred to as \\"our Joan\\" in conversation). With urbanisation, distinctive urban accents have arisen which often differ greatly from the historical accents of the surrounding rural areas and sometimes share features with Southern English accents. Northern English dialects remain an important part of the culture of the region, and the desire of speakers to assert their local identity has led to accents such as Scouse and Geordie becoming more distinctive and spreading into surrounding areas. Other languages There are no recognised minority languages in Northern England, although the Northumbrian Language Society campaigns to have the Northumbrian dialect recognised as a separate language. It is possible that traces of now-extinct Brythonic Celtic languages from the region survive in some rural areas in the Yan Tan Tethera counting systems traditionally used by shepherds. Contact between English and immigrant languages has given rise to new accents and dialects. For instance, the variety of English spoken by Poles in Manchester is distinct both from typical Polish-accented English and from Mancunian. At a local level, the diversity of immigrant communities means that some languages that are extremely rare in the country as a whole have strongholds in Northern towns: Bradford for instance has the largest proportion of Pashto speakers, while Manchester has most Cantonese speakers. History The prehistoric North alt=A 7.6 metre (26 foot) pillar of stone in a graveyard. During the ice ages, Northern England was buried under ice sheets, and little evidence remains of habitation ‚Äì either because the climate made the area uninhabitable, or because glaciation destroyed most evidence of human activity. The northernmost cave art in Europe is found at Creswell Crags in northern Derbyshire, near modern-day Sheffield, which shows signs of Neanderthal inhabitation 50 to 60 thousand years ago, and of a more modern occupation known as the Creswellian culture around 12,000 years ago. The dates given in the source are 28,000 14C years ago for the Gravettian and 12,500 to 12,200 14C years ago for the Magdalenian. The 14C radiocarbon dating years have been adjusted to give calendar ('real') years. Kirkwell Cave in Lower Allithwaite, Cumbria shows signs of the Federmesser culture of the Paleolithic, and was inhabited some time between 13,400 and 12,800 years ago. Significant settlement appears to have begun in the Mesolithic era, with Star Carr in North Yorkshire generally considered the most significant monument of this era. The Star Carr site includes Britain's oldest known house, from around 9000 BC, and the earliest evidence of carpentry in the form of a carved tree trunk from 11000 BC. The Lincolnshire and Yorkshire Wolds around the Humber Estuary were settled and farmed in the Bronze Age, and the Ferriby Boats ‚Äì one of the best-preserved finds of the era ‚Äì were discovered near Hull in 1937. In the more mountainous regions of the Peak District, hillforts were the main Bronze Age settlement and the locals were most likely pastoralists raising livestock. Iron Age and the Romans Hadrian's Wall, one of the most famous Roman remains in Northern England, is now a alt=A stone wall winding over a hilly landscape Roman histories name the Celtic tribe that occupied the majority of Northern England as the Brigantes, likely meaning \\"Highlanders\\". Whether the Brigantes were a unified group or a looser federation of tribes around the Pennines is debated, but the name appears to have been adopted by the inhabitants of the region, which was known by the Romans as Brigantia. Other tribes mentioned in ancient histories, which may have been part of the Brigantes or separate nations, are the Carvetii of modern-day Cumbria and the Parisi of east Yorkshire. The Brigantes allied with the Roman Empire during the Roman conquest of Britain: Tacitus records that they handed the resistance leader Caratacus over to the Empire in 51.Tacitus, Annals 12:36 Power struggles within the Brigantes made the Romans wary, and they were conquered in a war beginning in the 70s under the governorship of Quintus Petillius Cerialis. The Romans created the province of \\"Britannia Inferior\\" (Lower Britain) in the North, and it was ruled from the city of Eboracum (modern York). Eboracum and Deva Victrix (modern Chester) were the main legionary bases in the region, with other smaller forts including Mamucium (Manchester) and Cataractonium (Catterick). Britannia Inferior extended as far north as Hadrian's Wall, which was the northernmost border of the Roman Empire. Although the Romans invaded modern-day Northumberland and part of Scotland beyond it, they never succeeded in conquering the reaches of Britain beyond the River Tyne. Anglo-Saxons and Vikings upright=1 After the end of Roman rule in Britain and the arrival of the Angles, Yr Hen Ogledd (the \\"Old North\\") was divided into rival kingdoms, Bernicia, Deira, Rheged and Elmet. Bernicia covered lands north of the Tees, Deira corresponded roughly to the eastern half of modern-day Yorkshire, Rheged to Cumbria, and Elmet to the western-half of Yorkshire. Bernicia and Deira were first united as Northumbria by Aethelfrith, a king of Bernicia who conquered Deira around the year 604. Northumbria then saw a Golden Age in cultural, scholarly and monastic activity, centred on Lindisfarne and aided by Irish monks. The north-west of England retains vestiges of a Celtic culture, and had its own Celtic language, Cumbric, spoken predominately in Cumbria until around the 12th century. Parts of the north and east of England were subject to Danish control (the Danelaw) during the Viking era, but the northern part of the old Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria remained under Anglo-Saxon control. Under the Vikings, monasteries were largely wiped out, and the discovery of grave goods in Northern churchyards suggests that Norse funeral rites replaced Christian ones for a time. Viking control of certain areas, particularly around Yorkshire, is recalled in the etymology of many place names: the thorpe in town names such as Cleethorpes and Scunthorpe, the kirk in Kirklees and Ormskirk and the by of Whitby and Grimsby all have Norse roots. Norman Conquest and the Middle Ages alt=A round castle keep atop a hill The 1066 defeat of the Norwegian king Harald Hardrada by the Anglo-Saxon Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Stamford Bridge near York marked the beginning of the end of Viking rule in England, and the almost immediate defeat of Godwinson at the hands of the Norman William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings was in turn the overthrow of the Anglo-Saxon order. The Northumbrian and Danish aristocracy resisted the Norman Conquest, and to put an end to the rebellion, William ordered the Harrying of the North. In the winter of 1069‚Äì1070, towns, villages and farms were systematically destroyed across much of Yorkshire as well as northern Lancashire and County Durham. The region was gripped by famine and much of Northern England was deserted. Chroniclers at the time reported a hundred thousand deaths ‚Äì modern estimates place the total somewhere in the tens of thousands, out of a population of two million. When the Domesday Book was compiled in 1086, much of Northern England was still recorded as wasteland, although this may have been in part because the chroniclers, more interested in manorial farmland, paid little attention to pastoral areas. The ruins of alt=The ruined walls of a large abbey with a tower Following Norman subjugation, monasteries returned to the North as missionaries sought to \\"settle the desert\\". Monastic orders such as the Cistercians became significant players in the economy of Northern England ‚Äì the Cistercian Fountains Abbey in North Yorkshire became the largest and richest of the Northern abbeys, and would remain so until the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Other Cistercian abbeys are at Rievaulx, Kirkstall and Byland. The 7th-century Whitby Abbey was Benedictine and Bolton Abbey, Augustinian. A significant Flemish immigration followed the conquest, which likely populated much of the desolated regions of Cumbria, and which was persistent enough that the town of Beverley in the East Riding of Yorkshire still had an ethnic enclave called Flemingate in the thirteenth century. During the Anarchy, Scotland invaded Northern England and took much of the land north of the Tees. In the 1139 peace treaty that followed, Prince Henry of Scotland was made Earl of Northumberland and kept the counties of Cumberland, Westmorland and Northumbria, as well as part of Lancashire. These reverted to English control in 1157, establishing for the most part the modern England‚ÄìScotland border. The region also saw violence during The Great Raid of 1322 when Robert the Bruce invaded and raided the whole of Northern England. There was also the Wars of the Roses, including the decisive Battle of Wakefield, although the modern-day conception of the war as a conflict between Lancashire and Yorkshire is anachronistic ‚Äì Lancastrians recruited from across Northern England, including Yorkshire, while the Yorkists drew most of their power from Southern England, Wales and Ireland. The Anglo-Scottish Wars also touched the region, and in just 400 years, Berwick-upon-Tweed ‚Äì now the northernmost town in England ‚Äì changed hands more than a dozen times. The wars also saw thousands of Scots settle south of the border, chiefly in the border counties and Yorkshire. Early modern era After the English Reformation, the North saw several Catholic uprisings, including the Lincolnshire Rising, Bigod's Rebellion in Cumberland and Westmorland, and largest of all, the Yorkshire- based Pilgrimage of Grace, all against Henry VIII. His daughter Elizabeth I faced another Catholic rebellion, the Rising of the North. The region would become the centre of recusancy as prominent Catholic families in Cumbria, Lancashire and Yorkshire refused to convert to Protestantism. Royal power over the region was exercised through the Council of the North at King's Manor, York, which was founded in 1484 by Richard III. The Council existed intermittently for the next two centuries ‚Äì its final incarnation was created in the aftermath of the Pilgrimage of Grace and was chiefly an institution for providing order and dispensing justice. Northern England was a focal point for fighting during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. The border counties were invaded by Scotland in the Second Bishops' War, and at the 1640 Treaty of Ripon King Charles I was forced to temporarily cede Northumberland and County Durham to the Scots and pay to keep the Scottish armies there. To raise enough funds and ratify the final peace treaty, Charles had to call what became the Long Parliament, beginning the process that led to the First English Civil War. In 1641, the Long Parliament abolished the Council of the North for perceived abuses during the Personal Rule period. By the time war broke out in 1642, King Charles had moved his court to York, and Northern England was to become a major base of the Royalist forces until they were routed at the Battle of Marston Moor. Industrial Revolution Salts Mill in alt=A large mill above a weir on a wide river At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, Northern England had plentiful coal and water power while the poor agriculture in the uplands meant that labour in the area was cheap. Mining and milling, which had been practiced on a small scale in the area for generations, began to grow and centralise. The boom in industrial textile manufacture is sometimes attributed to the damp climate and soft water making it easier to wash and work fibres, although the success of Northern fabric mills has no single clear source. Readily available coal and the discovery of large iron deposits in Cumbria and Cleveland allowed ironmaking and, with the invention of the Bessemer process, steelmaking to take root in the region. High quality steel in turn fed the shipyards that opened along the coasts, especially on Tyneside and at Barrow-in-Furness. alt=The Three Graces, three grand early twentieth century office buildings, on the bank of the River Mersey The Great Famine in Ireland of the 1840s drove migrants across the Irish Sea, and many settled in the industrial cities of the North, especially Manchester and Liverpool ‚Äì at the 1851 census, 13% of the population of Manchester and Salford were Irish-born, and in Liverpool the figure was 22%. In response there was a wave of anti-Catholic riots and Protestant Orange Orders proliferated across Northern England, chiefly in Lancashire, but also elsewhere in the North. By 1881 there were 374 Orange organisations in Lancashire, 71 in the North East, and 42 in Yorkshire. From further afield, Northern England saw immigration from European countries such as Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia and Scandinavia. Some immigrants were well-to-do industrialists seeking to do business in the booming industrial cities, some were escaping poverty, some were servants or slaves, some were sailors who chose to settle in the port towns, some were Jews fleeing pogroms on the continent, and some were migrants originally stranded at Liverpool after attempting to catch an onwards ship to the United States or to colonies of the British Empire. At the same time, hundreds of thousands from depressed rural areas of the North emigrated, chiefly to the US, Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. Deindustrialisation and modern history The alt=A warehouse signed \\"Baltic Flour Mills\\" surrounded by modern buildings. The First World War was the turning point for the economy of Northern England. In the interwar years, the Northern economy began to be eclipsed by the South ‚Äì in 1913‚Äì1914, unemployment in \\"outer Britain\\" (the North, plus Scotland and Wales) was 2.6% while the rate in Southern England was more than double that at 5.5%, but in 1937 during the Great Depression the outer British unemployment rate was 16.1% and the Southern rate was less than half that at 7.1%. The weakening economy and interwar unemployment caused several episodes of social unrest in the region, including the 1926 general strike and the Jarrow March. The Great Depression highlighted the weakness of Northern England's specialised economy: as world trade declined, demand for ships, steel, coal and textiles all fell. For the most part, Northern factories were still using nineteenth-century technology, and were not able to keep up with advances in industries such as motors, chemicals and electricals, while the expansion of the electric grid removed the North's advantages in terms of power generation and meant it was now more economic to build new factories in the Midlands or South. The industrial concentration in Northern England made it a major target for Luftwaffe attacks during the Second World War. The Blitz of 1940‚Äì1941 saw major raids on Barrow-in-Furness, Hull, Leeds, Manchester, Merseyside, Newcastle and Sheffield with thousands killed and significant damage to the cities. Liverpool, a vital port for supplies from North America, was especially hard hit ‚Äì the city was the most bombed in the UK outside London, with around 4,000 deaths across Merseyside and most of the city centre destroyed. The rebuilding that followed, and the simultaneous slum clearance that saw whole neighbourhoods demolished and rebuilt, transformed the faces of Northern cities. Immigration from the \\"New Commonwealth\\", especially Pakistan and Bangladesh, starting in the 1950s reshaped Northern England once more, and there are now significant populations from the Indian subcontinent in towns and cities such as Bradford, Leeds, Preston and Sheffield. Deindustrialisation continued and unemployment gradually increased during the 1970s, but accelerated during the government of Margaret Thatcher, who chose not to encourage growth in the North if it risked growth in the South. The era saw the 1984‚Äì85 miners' strike, which brought hardship for many Northern mining towns. Northern metropolitan county councils, which were Labour strongholds often with very left-wing leadership (such as Militant-dominated Liverpool and the so-called \\"People's Republic of South Yorkshire\\"), had high-profile conflicts with the national government. The increasing awareness of the North‚ÄìSouth divide strengthened the distinct Northern English identity, which, despite regeneration in some of the major cities, remains to this day. The region saw several IRA attacks during the Troubles, including the M62 coach bombing, the Warrington bomb attacks and the 1992 and 1996 Manchester bombings. The latter was the largest bomb detonation in Great Britain since the end of the Second World War, and damaged or destroyed much of central Manchester. The attack led to Manchester's ageing infrastructure being rebuilt and modernised, sparking the regeneration of the city and making it a leading example of post-industrial redevelopment followed by other cities in the region and beyond. Demographics upright=1.2 As of the 2011 census, Northern England had a population of 14,933,000 ‚Äì a growth of 5.1% since 2001 ‚Äì in 6,364,000 households, meaning that Northerners comprise 28% of the English population and 24% of the UK population. Taken overall, 8% of the population of Northern England were born overseas (3% from the European Union including Ireland and 5% from elsewhere), substantially less than the England and Wales average of 13%, and 5% define their nationality as something other than a UK or Irish identity. 90.5% of the population described themselves as white, compared to an England and Wales average of 85.9%; other ethnicities represented include Pakistani (2.9%), Indian (1.3%), Black (1.3%), Chinese (0.6%) and Bangladeshi (0.5%). The broad averages hide significant variation within the region: Allerdale and Redcar and Cleveland had a greater percentage of the population identifying as White British (97.6% each) than any other district in England and Wales, while Manchester (66.5%), Bradford (67.4%) and Blackburn with Darwen (69.1%) had among the lowest proportions of White British outside London. Languages Bilingual English/Chinese signage in upright=1.1 95% of the Northern population speak English as a first language ‚Äì compared to an England and Wales average of 92% ‚Äì and another 4% speak English as a second language well or very well. The 5% of the population who have another native language are chiefly speakers of European or South Asian languages. As of the 2011 census, the largest languages apart from English were Polish (spoken by 0.7% of the population), Urdu (0.6%) and Punjabi (0.5%), and 0.4% of the population speak a variety of Chinese: a similar distribution to that in the whole of England. Redcar and Cleveland has the largest proportion of the population speaking English as a first language in England, with 99.3%. Religion At the 2011 census, the North East and North West had the largest proportion of Christians in England and Wales; 67.5% and 67.3% respectively (the proportion in Yorkshire and the Humber was lower at 59.5%). Yorkshire and the Humber and the North West both had significant populations of Muslims ‚Äì 6.2% and 5.1% respectively ‚Äì while Muslims in the North East made up only 1.8% of the population. All other faiths combined comprised less than 2% of the population in all regions. The census question on religion has been criticised by the British Humanist Association as leading, and other surveys of religion tend to find very different results. The 2015 British Election Survey found 52% of Northerners identified as Christian (22% Anglican, 14% non-denominational Christian, 12% Roman Catholic, 2% Methodist, and 2% other Christian denominations), 40% as non-religious, 5% as Muslim, 1% as Hindu and 1% as Jewish. Health upright=1.2 One major manifestation of the North‚ÄìSouth divide is in health and life expectancy statistics. All three Northern England statistical regions have lower than average life expectancies and higher than average rates of cancer, circulatory disease and respiratory disease. Blackpool has the lowest life expectancy at birth in England ‚Äì male life expectancy at birth between 2012 and 2014 was 74.7, against an England-wide average of 79.5 ‚Äì and the majority of English districts in the bottom 50 were in the North East or the North West. However, regional differences do seem to be slowly narrowing: between 1991 and 1993 and 2012‚Äì2014, life expectancy in the North East increased by 6.0 years and in the North West by 5.8 years, the fastest increases in any region outside London, and the gap between life expectancy in the North East and South East is now 2.5 years, down from 2.9 in 1993. These health inequalities manifested during the COVID-19 pandemic in high infection rates, death rates and excess mortality in Northern England, and in severe job losses in the following Great Lockdown recession. By June 2020, the infection rate in Northern England was nearly double that in London, and a study by the Northern Health Science Alliance found that of the six worst affected areas in England during the pandemic in their study, five were located in the North. Education Before the 19th century there were no universities in Northern England. The first was the University of Durham, founded in 1832 and sometimes counted with the ancient universities of Oxford and Cambridge, although it post-dates them by many centuries. The next universities built in the North were part of the wave of redbrick universities of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Today, there are seven Northern institutions in the Russell Group of leading research universities: Durham, the redbricks of Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle and Sheffield and the later plate glass university of York. These universities, together with plate-glass Lancaster, form the N8 Research Partnership. There is a significant attainment gap between Northern and Southern schools, and pupils in the three Northern regions are less likely than the national average to achieve five higher-tier GCSEs, although this may be down to economic disadvantages faced by Northern pupils rather than an actual difference in school quality. Northern students are under-represented at Oxbridge, where three times as many places go to Southerners as to Northerners, and other Southern universities while Southerners are under- represented at leading Northern universities such as Sheffield, Manchester and Leeds. There are calls for the government to invest in education in disadvantaged parts of Northern England to redress this.Northern children 'too often left behind', says commissioner BBC Economy Like the UK as a whole, the Northern English economy is now dominated by the service sector ‚Äì as of September 2016, 82.2% of workers in the Northern statistical regions were employed in services, compared to 83.7% for the UK as a whole. Manufacturing now employs 9.5%, compared to the national average of 7.6%. The unemployment rate in Northern England is 5.3% compared to an England-wide and UK-wide average of 4.8%, and the North East has the highest unemployment rate in the UK, at 7.0% as of December 2016, more than one percentage point higher than any other region. As of 2015, the gross value added (GVA) of the Northern English economy was ¬£316 billion, and if it were an independent nation, it would be the tenth largest economy in Europe. The region does have poor growth and productivity rates compared to Southern England and to other EU countries. Growth, employment and household income have lagged behind the South, and the five most deprived districts in England are all in Northern England, as are ten of the twelve most declining major towns in the UK. The picture is not clear-cut, as the North has areas which are as wealthy as, if not wealthier than, fashionable Southern areas such as Surrey. Yorkshire's Golden Triangle which extends from north Leeds to Harrogate and across to York is an example, as is Cheshire's Golden Triangle, centred on Alderley Edge.Maconie 2008, p. 227 There are major disparities even across individual cities: Sheffield Hallam is one of the wealthiest constituencies in the country, and is the richest outside London and the South East, while Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough, just on the other side of the city, is one of the most deprived. Housing in Northern England is more affordable than the UK average: the median house price in most Northern cities was below ¬£200,000 in 2015 with typical increases of below 10% over the previous five years. However, some areas have seen house prices fall considerably, putting inhabitants at risk of negative equity. To stimulate the Northern economy, the government has organised a series of programmes to invest in and develop the region, of which the latest as of 2017 is the Northern Powerhouse. The North has also been a significant recipient of European Union Structural Funds. Between 2007 and 2013, EU funds created around 70,000 jobs in the region, and the majority of Northern Powerhouse funding comes from the European Regional Development Fund and the European Investment Bank. The loss of these funds following Brexit, combined with potential reductions in exports to the EU, has been identified as a threat to Northern growth. Public sector The public sector is a major employer in Northern England. Between 2000 and 2008, the majority of new jobs created in Northern England were for the government and its suppliers and contractors. All three Northern regions have public sector employment above the national average, and North East has the highest level in England with 20.2% of the workforce in the public sector as of 2016 ‚Äì down from 23.4% a decade earlier. The austerity programme under the government of David Cameron saw significant cuts to public services, and the reduction in public sector employment resulted in job losses for around 3% of the Northern England workforce with significant impact on the regional economy. Agriculture and fisheries Teeswaters, are a major part of Northern English agriculture.alt=Sheep with thick, stringy wool in a field. There are of farmland in Northern England. The rough Pennine terrain means that most of Northern England is unsuited for growing crops; like Scotland, Northern farming was traditionally dominated by oats, which grow better than wheat in poor soil. Today, the mix of cereals and vegetables grown is similar to that of the UK as a whole, but only a minority of land is arable. Only 32% of Northern farmland is primarily used for growing crops, compared to 49% for England as a whole. Conversely, 57% of the land is given over to rearing livestock, and 33% of England's cattle, 43% of its pigs and 46% of its sheep and lambs are reared in the North. The only part of the region that is predominantly given over to crops is the land around the Humber estuary, where the well-drained fens result in excellent quality land. The lowland Cheshire Plain is mostly given over to dairy farming, while in the Pennines and Cheviots grazing sheep play an important role not just in agriculture but also in land management more generally. Heather moorland in the Pennine uplands is home to driven grouse shooting from 12 August (the Glorious Twelfth) until 10 December every year. The number of grouse moors in Northern England is a major threat to natural predators, which are often killed by gamekeepers to protect grouse, and as a result the Cumbria Wildlife Trust describes the North's moors as a \\"black hole\\" for the endangered hen harrier. Sea fishing is an important industry for Northern coastal towns. Major fishing ports include Fleetwood, Grimsby, Hull and Whitby. At its height, Grimsby was the largest fishing port in the world, but the Northern fishing industry suffered greatly from a series of events in the second half of the twentieth century: the Cod Wars with Iceland and establishment of the exclusive economic zone ended British access to rich North Atlantic fishing grounds, while the North Sea was badly overfished and the European Common Fisheries Policy put strict quotas on catches to protect the almost depleted stocks. Grimsby is now transitioning to the processing of imported seafood and to offshore wind to replace its fishing fleet. Manufacturing and energy Northern England has a strong export- based economy, with trade more balanced than the UK average, and the North East is the only region of England to regularly export more than it imports. Chemicals, vehicles, machinery and other manufactured goods make up the majority of Northern exports, just over half of which go to EU countries. Major manufacturing plants include car plants at Vauxhall Ellesmere Port, Jaguar Land Rover Halewood and Nissan Sunderland, the Leyland Trucks factory, the Hitachi Newton Aycliffe train plant, the Humber, Lindsey and Stanlow oil refineries, the NEPIC cluster of chemical works based around Teesside, and the nuclear processing facilities at Springfields and Sellafield. Offshore oil and gas from North Sea and Irish Sea, and more recently offshore wind power, are significant components in Northern England's energy mix. Although deep-pit coal mining in the UK ended in 2015 with the closure of Kellingley Colliery, North Yorkshire, there are still several open-pit mines in the area. Shale gas is especially prevalent across Northern England, although plans to extract it through hydraulic fracturing (\\"fracking\\") have proven to be controversial. Retail and services alt=A cluster of modernist office buildings in at night. Around 10% of the Northern England workforce is employed in retail.IPPR North (2012), pp. 190‚Äì192 Of the Big Four supermarkets in the UK, two ‚Äì Asda and Morrisons ‚Äì are based in the North. Northern England was the birthplace of the modern cooperative movement, and the Manchester-based Co-operative Group has the highest revenue of any firm in the North West.Wilson, J. F., Webster, A. and Vorberg-Rugh, R. (2013) \\"Building Co-operation: A business history of The Co-operative Group\\", Oxford University Press, Oxford The area is also home to many online retailers, with startups emerging around tech hubs in Northern cities. With urban regeneration, high-value service sector industries such as corporate services and financial services have taken root in Northern England, with major hubs around Leeds and Manchester. Call centres ‚Äì attracted by low labour costs and a preference for Northern English accents among the public ‚Äì have replaced heavy industry as major employers of unskilled workers, with more than 5% of workers in all Northern England regions working in one.Russell (2004), p. 115 High-tech and research Together, the N8 research universities have over 190,000 students and contribute more to the Northern economy in terms of GVA than agriculture, car manufacturing or media. Discoveries and inventions at these universities have resulted in spin-offs worth hundreds of millions to local economies: the discovery of graphene at the University of Manchester produced the National Graphene Institute and the Sir Henry Royce Institute for Advanced Materials, while robotics research at the University of Sheffield led to the development of the Advanced Manufacturing Park. Recent decades have seen the growth of high-tech companies based around Northern England's major cities. There are eleven high-tech firms worth over $1 billion based in the region, and digital industries support around 300,000 jobs. Game development, online retail, health technology and analytics are among the major high-tech sectors in the North. Leisure and tourism alt=A postcard of Blackpool promenade. The expansion of the railway network in the second half of the nineteenth century meant most in the North lived within reach of the coast, and seaside towns saw a major tourism boom. By around 1870 Blackpool on the Lancashire coast had become overwhelmingly the most popular destination ‚Äì not just for Northern families, but many from the Midlands and Scotland as well. Other resorts popular with Northerners included Morecambe in northern Lancashire, Whitley Bay near Newcastle, Whitby in North Yorkshire, and New Brighton on the Wirral Peninsula, as well as Rhyl over the border in North Wales. The same social forces that had built these resorts in the nineteenth century proved to be their undoing in the twentieth. Transport links continued to improve and it became possible to travel overseas quickly and affordably. The Belgian coast at Ostend became popular with Northern working-class tourists in the first half of the twentieth century, and the introduction of package holidays in the 1970s was the death of most Northern seaside resorts. Blackpool has maintained a focus on tourism, and remains one of the most visited towns in England, but visitor numbers are far below their peak and the town's economy has suffered ‚Äì both employment rates and average earnings remain below the regional average. The wild landscapes of the North are a major draw for tourists, and many urban areas are looking for regeneration through industrial, heritage and cultural tourism: of the 24 national museums and galleries in England outside London, 14 are located in the North. As of 2015, Northern England receives around a quarter of all domestic tourism within the UK, with 28.7 million visitors in 2015, but only 8% of international tourists to the United Kingdom visit the region. Media =Television= As part of a drive to reduce media centralisation in London, the BBC and ITV have moved much of their programme production to MediaCityUK in Salford and Channel 4 has moved its headquarters to Leeds. Of the four national evening soap operas, three are set and filmed in Northern England (Coronation Street in Manchester, Emmerdale in the Yorkshire Dales and Hollyoaks in Chester) and these are important to the local TV industry ‚Äì the commitment to Emmerdale saved ITV Yorkshire's Leeds Studios from closure. The region also has a reputation for drama serials and has produced some the most successful and acclaimed series of recent decades, including Boys from the Blackstuff, Our Friends in the North, Clocking Off, Shameless and Last Tango in Halifax. =Newspapers= Since The Guardian (formerly The Manchester Guardian) moved to London in 1964, no major national paper is based in the North, and Northern news stories tend to be poorly covered in the national press. The Yorkshire Post promotes itself as \\"Yorkshire's national paper\\" and covers some national and international stories, but is primarily focused on news from Yorkshire and the North East. An attempt in 2016 to create a dedicated North-focused national newspaper, 24, failed after six weeks. Across Northern England as a whole, The Sun is the best selling newspaper, but the ongoing boycott around Merseyside following the newspaper's coverage of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster has seen the paper fall behind both the Daily Mail and the Daily Mirror in the North West. In general national readership in the North drags behind that of the South; the Mirror and the Daily Star are the only national papers with more readers in Northern England than in the South East and London. Local newspapers are the top-selling titles in both the North East and Yorkshire and the Humber, although Northern regional newspapers have seen steep declines in readership in recent years. Only seven daily Northern papers have circulation figures above 25,000 as of June 2016: Manchester Evening News, Liverpool Echo, Hull Daily Mail, Newcastle Chronicle, The Yorkshire Post and The Northern Echo. =Communications and the internet= Connecting Cumbria is one of many projects to bring alt=Workers install cables in a trench in a field. Manchester Network Access Point is the only internet exchange point in the UK outside London, and forms the main hub for the region. Household internet access in Northern England is at or above the UK average, but speeds and broadband penetration vary greatly. In 2013 the average speed in central Manchester was 60 Mbit/s, while in nearby Warrington the average speed was only 6.2 Mbit/s. Hull, which is unique in the UK in that its telephone network was never nationalised, has simultaneously some of the fastest and slowest internet speeds in the country: many households have \\"ultrafast\\" fibre optic broadband as standard, but it is also one of only two places in the UK where over 30% of businesses receive less than 10 Mbit/s. Speeds are especially poor in the rural parts of the North, with many small towns and villages completely without high speed access. Some areas have therefore formed their own community enterprises, such as Broadband 4 Rural North in Lancashire and Cybermoor in Cumbria, to install high-speed internet connections. Mobile broadband coverage is similarly patchy, with 3G and 4G almost universal in cities but unavailable in large parts of Yorkshire, the North East and Cumbria. Culture and identity The upright=1.2 The individual regions of the North have had their own identities and cultures for centuries, but with industrialisation, mass media and the opening of the North‚ÄìSouth divide, a common Northern identity began to develop. This identity was initially a reactionary response to Southern prejudices‚Äîthe North of the nineteenth century was largely depicted as a dirty, wild and uncultured place, even in sympathetic depictions such as Elizabeth Gaskell's 1855 novel North and South‚Äîbut became an affirmation of what Northerners saw as their own personal strengths. Traits stereotypically associated with Northern England are straight-talking, grit and warmheartedness, as compared to the supposedly effete Southerners. Northern England‚Äîespecially Lancashire, but also Yorkshire and the North East‚Äîhas a tradition of matriarchal families, where the woman of the house runs the home and controls the family's finances. This too has its roots in industrialisation, when mills offered well-paid work for women: during depressions when demand for coal and steel were low, women were often the main breadwinners. Northern women are still stereotyped as strong-willed and independent, or affectionately as battle-axes. Clothing alt=A grey wool flat cap on a man's head. The North of England is often stereotypically represented through the clothing worn by working-class men and women in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Working men would wear a heavy jacket and trousers held up by braces, an overcoat, and a hat, typically a flat cap, while women would wear a dress, or a skirt and blouse, with an apron on top as protection from dirt; in colder months they would often wear a shawl or headscarf. The maud, a woollen plaid woven in a pattern of small black and white checks, was also popular in Northern England until the early twentieth century.Moffat, A. (2015). Scotland: A history from the earliest times. Edinburgh: Birlinn. If not wearing leather lace-up shoes, some men and women would have worn English clogs, which were hardwearing and had replaceable soles and tips. Factory workers tapping their feet in time with the click of machinery developed a type of folk clog dance referred to as clogging, which was intricately developed in the North. In the second half of the twentieth century, these traditional clothes fell out of fashion. Other styles such as \\"casual clobber\\" (mainland European designer clothing brought back by touring football fans) and sportswear became more popular, and the influence of Northern bands and football teams helped spread them across the country. In the twenty-first century, some traditional Northern items of clothing have begun to make a comeback ‚Äì in particular, the flat cap. Cuisine Impressions of Northern English cuisine are still shaped by the working-class diet of the early twentieth century, which was heavy on offal, high in calories and often not particularly healthy. Dishes such as black pudding, tripe, mushy peas and meat pie remain stereotypical Northern English foods in the national imagination. As a result, there is a concerted effort among Northern chefs to improve the region's image. Some Northern dishes such as Yorkshire pudding and Lancashire hotpot have spread across the UK, and only their names now hint at their origin. Among the Northern delicacies that have achieved Protected Geographical Status are traditional Cumberland sausage, traditional Grimsby smoked fish, Swaledale cheese, Yorkshire forced rhubarb and Yorkshire Wensleydale. The North is known for its often crumbly cheeses, of which Cheshire cheese is the earliest example. Unlike Southern cheeses like Cheddar, Northern cheeses typically use uncooked milk and a pre-salted curd pressed under enormous weights, resulting in a moist, sharp-tasting cheese. Wensleydale, another crumbly cheese, is unusual in that it is often served as a side to sweet cakes, which are themselves well represented in Northern England. Parkin, an oatmeal cake with black treacle and ginger, is a traditional treat across the North on Bonfire Night, and the fruity scone-like singing hinny and fat rascal are popular in the North East and Yorkshire respectively. While a variety of beers are popular across Northern England, the region is especially associated with brown ales such as Newcastle Brown Ale, Double Maxim and Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale. Beer in the North is usually served with a thick head which accentuates the nutty, malty flavours preferred in Northern beers. On the non-alcoholic side, the North ‚Äì in particular, Lancashire ‚Äì was the hub of the temperance bar movement which popularised soft drinks such as dandelion and burdock, Tizer and Vimto. Greggs, the bakery chain, is an integral part of Northern cuisine and Northern identity. The number of people per Greggs has been cited as a key indicator as to whether a town should be considered Northern. In recent decades, immigration to Northern England has shaped its cuisine. The Teesside parmo is one example, derived from escalope Parmesan brought to the area by an Italian- American immigrant and adapted to the region's taste. There are large Chinatowns in Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle, and communities from the Indian subcontinent in all major towns. Bradford has won the Federation of Specialist Restaurant's \\"Curry Capital\\" title six years in a row as of 2016, while the Curry Mile in Manchester formerly had the largest concentration of curry restaurants in the UK and now offers a wide range of South Asian and Middle Eastern cuisine. Literature The daffodils of the Lake District are immortalised in Wordworth's \\"I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud\\". The contrasting geography of Northern England is reflected in its literature. On the one hand, the wild moors and lakes have inspired generations of Romantic authors: the poetry of William Wordsworth and the novels of the Bront√´ sisters are perhaps the most famous examples of writing inspired by these elemental forces. Classics of children's literature such as The Railway Children (1906), The Secret Garden (1911) and Swallows and Amazons (1930) portray these largely untouched landscapes as worlds of adventure and transformation where their protagonists can break free of the restrictions of society. Modern poets such as the Poet Laureates Ted Hughes and Simon Armitage have found inspiration in the Northern countryside, producing works that take advantage of the sounds and rhythms of Northern English dialects. Meanwhile, the industrialising and urbanising cities of the North gave rise to many masterpieces of social realism. Elizabeth Gaskell was the first in a lineage of female realist writers from the North that later included Winifred Holtby, Catherine Cookson, Beryl Bainbridge and Jeanette Winterson. Many of the angry young men of post- war literature were Northern, and working-class life in the face of deindustrialisation is depicted in novels such as Room at the Top (1959), Billy Liar (1959), This Sporting Life (1960) and A Kestrel for a Knave (1968). Music Scarborough Fair\\", a traditional Northern folk song upright=1.2 Traditional folk music in Northern England is a combination of styles of England and Scotland ‚Äì what is now called the Anglo-Scottish border ballad was once prevalent as far south as Lancashire. In the Middle Ages, much of Northern folk was accompanied by bagpipes, with styles including the Lancashire bagpipe, Yorkshire bagpipe and Northumbrian smallpipes. These disappeared in the early nineteenth century from the industrialising south of the region, but remain in the music of Northumbria. The British brass band tradition began in Northern England at around the same time: the dismissal of the Cheshire, Lancashire and Yorkshire military bands after the Napoleonic Wars, combined with the desire of industrial communities to better themselves, led to the founding of civilian bands. These bands provided entertainment at community events and led protest marches during the era of radical agitation. Although the style has since spread across much of Great Britain, brass bands remain a stereotype of the North, and the Whit Friday brass band contests draw hundreds of bands from across the UK and further afield. Northern England also has a thriving popular music scene. Influential movements include Merseybeat from the Liverpool area, which produced The Beatles, Northern soul, which brought Motown to England, and Madchester, the precursor to the rave scene. Across the Pennines, Sheffield is the birthplace of influential electronic pop bands from Cabaret Voltaire to Pulp, the New Yorkshire indie rock movement of the 2000s gave the country the Kaiser Chiefs and the Arctic Monkeys, and Teesside has a rock scene stretching from Chris Rea to Max√Ømo Park. The press frequently frames music stories and reviews in terms of cultural and class differences between North and South, notably in the 1960s rivalry between the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and the 1990s Battle of Britpop between Oasis and Blur. Sport Headingley in Leeds is one of the main stadia in the North for both cricket and rugby.upright=1.1 Sport has been both one of the most unifying cultural forces in Northern England and, thanks to local rivalries such as the Lancashire‚ÄìYorkshire Roses rivalry, one of the most divisive. As huge numbers of people moved into recently built cities with little cultural heritage, local sports teams offered the population a sense of place and identity that was otherwise absent. Adapted from Many early Northern sports players were working class and needed to miss work to play, with their teams compensating them for lost wages. By contrast, Southern teams, drawing from the traditions of public schools and Oxbridge, put great emphasis on amateurism and the Southern-dominated governing bodies forbade payments to players. This tension shaped the sports of association football and cricket, and led to the schism between the two main forms of rugby. The North is also associated with the animal sports of dog racing with whippets, pigeon racing and ferret legging, although these are now far more popular in stereotype than in reality. Manchester hosted the 2002 Commonwealth Games, which left it a legacy of sporting facilities including the City of Manchester Stadium, Manchester Aquatics Centre and the National Cycling Centre, headquarters of British Cycling. The Grand D√©part for the 2014 Tour de France was in Leeds, and every year since Yorkshire has hosted the Tour de Yorkshire cycling event, part of the UCI Europe Tour. Tyneside meanwhile hosts the Great North Run, the UK's biggest mass-participation sporting event and the most popular half marathon in the world. Football The Liverpool‚ÄìEverton upright=1.2 The first football club in the UK was Sheffield F.C., founded in 1857. Early Northern football teams tended to adopt the Sheffield Rules rather than the Football Association Rules, but the two codes were merged in 1877. Many of the innovations of Sheffield Rules are now part of the global game, including corners, throw-ins, and free kicks for fouls. In 1883 Blackburn Olympic, a team composed mainly of factory workers, became the first Northern team to win the FA Cup, and the next year Preston North End won an FA Cup match against London-based Upton Park. Upton Park protested that Preston had broken FA rules by paying their players. In response, Preston withdrew from the competition and fellow Lancashire clubs Burnley and Great Lever followed suit. The protest gathered momentum to the point where more than 30 clubs, predominantly from the North, announced that they would set up a rival British Football Association if the FA did not permit professionalism. A schism was avoided in July 1885 when professionalism was formally legalised in English football. The Football League was founded in 1888, and marked its independence from the London-based Football Association (FA) by establishing headquarters in Preston ‚Äì the League retained a Northern identity even after it accepted several Southern teams into its ranks. Organised women's football followed as the workforces of majority-female factories of Northern England in the First World War entered the 1917‚Äì18 Tyne, Wear & Tees Munition Girls Cup ‚Äì the world's first women's football tournament. However, the FA did not support women's football and banned it altogether in 1921. Intense local derbies between neighbouring teams mean that there is less of a North‚ÄìSouth rivalry than in some other sports. upright=1.2 Many of the powerhouses of English football came from the North ‚Äì as of the 2019‚Äì20 season, of the 122 top-flight league titles since 1888, 82 (67%) have been won by teams based north of Crewe. Since this article, which quotes 116 league titles, there have been six more titles, three won by a Northern team. Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United and Manchester City are among the mainstays of the Premier League, while teams like Blackburn Rovers, Middlesbrough, Newcastle United and Sunderland have had more inconsistent runs in recent years, regularly being promoted and relegated from the top flight. Northern England is also the birthplace of the largest proportion the country's top players ‚Äì as of Euro 2016, 537 Northerners had played for the England team, compared to 266 Midlanders and 367 Southerners, and 15 of the 23 man squad for the 2018 World Cup, as well as 14 of the 2019 Women's World Cup squad, were born in the region. The Guardian's figure includes Gary Cahill from Dronfield, which is part of the Sheffield City Region but is located in North East Derbyshire. Rugby Every alt=Two rugby league teams playing in front of full stands. The Rugby Football Union, which enforced amateurism, suspended teams who compensated their players for missed work and injury, leading teams from Lancashire, Yorkshire and surrounding areas to split away in 1895 and form the Rugby Football League. Over time, the RFU and RFL adopted different rules and the two forms of the game ‚Äì rugby union and rugby league ‚Äì diverged. Rugby league's stronghold remains Northern England along the \\"M62 corridor\\" between Liverpool and Hull. As of the 2020 season, 10 of the 12 teams in the Super League (the highest level of rugby league in the Northern Hemisphere) are from Northern England, with one team from Canada and one from France, and the 14-team Championship below it has 12 Northern teams, one London team and 1 French team. Rugby union was not entirely driven from Northern England, and in the 1970s the region was home to several strong teams. The high-water mark of rugby union in Northern England was the 1979 New Zealand tour during which the English Northern Division was the only team to defeat the All Blacks. In the 21st century the region's club sides have become less popular, with association football, cricket and rugby league attracting more spectators and talent. In the 2019‚Äì20 season, Sale Sharks are the only Northern team left in the English Premiership, and Newcastle Falcons, Yorkshire Carnegie and Doncaster R.F.C. play in the RFU Championship. Cricket pavilion at Lancashire's Old Trafford Cricket Ground is an icon of the game.alt=An ornate brick building with two towers, with stands in front.upright=1.2 Cricket has a strong following in Northern England, and three counties are represented by first- class county cricket teams: Durham, Lancashire and Yorkshire. The Roses Match (named for the Red Rose of Lancaster and the White Rose of York) between Lancashire and Yorkshire is one of the hardest fought rivalries in the sport ‚Äì the pride of both sides, and their determination not to lose, resulted in the teams developing a slow, stubborn and defensive style that proved unpopular elsewhere in the country. The London-based Marylebone Cricket Club, which controlled the game at the time, selected few Northern players for Test matches, and this was perceived as a snub to their playing style ‚Äì the anger united Lancashire and Yorkshire against the South and helped cast a shared Northern identity that transcended the Roses rivalry. This divide was illustrated in the 1924 County Championship, when Yorkshire beat London-based Middlesex to claim the title. Surrey accused Yorkshire of scuffing the pitch and intimidating the bowlers, while the match with Middlesex was so vicious that the team threatened to never play in Yorkshire again. The Lancashire captain Jack Sharp on the other hand was quoted as saying \\"I'm real glad a rose won it. Red or white, it doesn't matter.\\" Durham are a recent addition to top-flight cricket, having only achieved first-class status in 1992, but have won the County Championship three times. Although Yorkshire and Lancashire were traditionally more relaxed about professionalism than other counties, cricket did not see the same regional schisms on the topic that rugby and football did ‚Äì there were debates over amateur status in first-class cricket, but these tensions were given release in the Gentlemen v Players fixture.. Nevertheless, the annual North v South games were among the most popular and competitive in the sport, running annually from 1849 until 1900 and intermittently thereafter. Politics 2019 general election, but saw its traditional Northern heartlands reduced.alt=A map of the United Kingdom, with all constituencies given equal area. In Northern England, Labour hold the majority of Northern seats, the Conservatives hold some rural seats, and the Liberal Democrats hold a single seat, as does the Speaker.upright=0.9 Northern England, as the first area in the world to industrialise, was the birthplace of much modern political thought. Marxism and, more generally, socialism were shaped by reports into the lives of the Northern working class, from Friedrich Engels' The Condition of the Working Class in England to George Orwell's The Road to Wigan Pier. Meanwhile, enterprise and trade at the North's ports influenced the birth of Manchester Liberalism, a laissez-faire free trade philosophy. Expounded by C. P. Scott and the Manchester Guardian, the movement's greatest success was the repeal of the Corn Laws, protests against which had led to the 1819 Peterloo Massacre in Manchester. The upright=0.9 The first Trades Union Congress was held in Manchester in 1868, and as of 2015 trade union membership in Northern England remained higher than in Southern England, although it is lower than in the other Home Nations. Since the Thatcher era, the Conservative Party struggled to gain support in the area. Today, Northern England is generally described as a stronghold of the Labour Party ‚Äì although the Conservatives hold some rural seats, they traditionally held almost no urban seats and as of the 2016 local elections there are no Conservative councillors on Liverpool City Council, Manchester City Council, Newcastle City Council or Sheffield City Council. During the 2019 general election, many traditionally Labour constituencies in Northern England swung heavily towards the Conservatives, and the collapse of the \\"red wall\\" of Northern Labour seats was a major factor in the Conservative victory. Historically the region was also a heartland for the Liberals, and between the 1980s and the 2010s their successors in the Liberal Democrats benefited from Conservative unpopularity by positioning themselves as the centrist alternative to Labour in the North. At the 2016 EU membership referendum, all three Northern England regions voted to leave, as did all English regions outside London. The largest Northern Remain vote was 60.4% in Manchester; the largest Leave vote was 69.9% in North East Lincolnshire. In total, the Leave vote in the Northern England regions was 55.9% ‚Äì higher than in the Southern England regions and the other Home Nations, but lower than in the Midlands or the East of England. The Eurosceptic UK Independence Party (UKIP) positioned themselves as the main challenger to Labour in Northern constituencies, and came second in many at the 2015 general election. UKIP originally struggled in the region due to vote splitting with the far-right British National Party (BNP), who exploited racial tensions in the wake of the 2001 Bradford riots and other riots in Northern towns. In 2006, 40% of BNP voters lived in Northern England and both BNP MEPs elected at the 2009 European elections came from Northern constituencies. After 2013, BNP support in the region collapsed as most voters swung to UKIP. The Northern UKIP vote in turn collapsed following the EU referendum, with most UKIP voters returning to their former allegiances. Campaigns for regional autonomy for the North have seen little electoral support. Plans by Labour under Tony Blair to create devolved regional assemblies for the three Northern regions were abandoned after the government lost the 2004 North East England devolution referendum against a No vote of 78%. The regionalist Yorkshire Party and North East Party only hold seats at the local council level, and the Northern Party, which campaigned for a devolved Northern government with the power to make laws and full control of taxation and spending, was wound up in 2016. Religion Christianity Christianity has been the largest religion in the region since the Early Middle Ages; its existence in Britain dates back to the late Roman era and the arrival of Celtic Christianity. The Holy Island of Lindisfarne played an essential role in the Christianisation of Northumbria, after Aidan from Connacht founded a monastery there as the first Bishop of Lindisfarne at the request of King Oswald. It is known for the creation of the Lindisfarne Gospels and remains a place of pilgrimage. Saint Cuthbert, a monk of Lindisfarne, was venerated from Nottinghamshire to Cumberland, and is today sometimes named the patron saint of Northern England. The Synod of Whitby saw Northumbria break from Celtic Christianity and return to the Roman Catholic church, as calculations of Easter and tonsure rules were brought into line with those of Rome. alt=A map of England, showing all Northern counties at least 10% Catholic and Lancashire more than 20% Catholic. After the English Reformation Northern England became a centre of Catholicism, and Irish immigration increased its numbers further, especially in North West cities like Liverpool and Manchester. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the area underwent a religious revival that ultimately produced Primitive Methodism, and at its peak in the 19th century Methodism was the dominant faith in much of Northern England. As of 2016, the list of places of worship registered for marriage for Northern England included at least 1,960 that are Methodist or Independent Methodist, 1,200 Roman Catholic, 370 United Reformed, 310 Baptist or Particular Baptist, 250 Jehovah's Witness and 240 Salvation Army, as well as many hundreds of churches from smaller denominations. Not all places of worship are registered, and some defunct churches remain on the list. In the ecclesiastical administration of the Church of England the entire North is covered by the Province of York, which is represented by the Archbishop of York ‚Äì the second-highest figure in the Church after the Archbishop of Canterbury. The unusual situation of having two archbishops at the top of Church hierarchy suggests that Northern England was seen as a sui generis. Likewise, with the exception of parts of the Diocese of Shrewsbury and Diocese of Nottingham, the North is covered in Roman Catholic Church administration by the Province of Liverpool, represented by the Archbishop of Liverpool. Other faiths A former Methodist church in Leeds, now converted into a Sikh temple Small Jewish communities arose in Beverley, Doncaster, Grimsby, Lancaster, Newcastle, and York in the wake of the Norman Conquest but suffered massacres and pogroms, of which the largest was the York Massacre in 1190. Jews were forcibly banished from England by the 1290 Edict of Expulsion until the Resettlement of the Jews in England in the seventeenth century, and the first synagogue in the North appeared in Liverpool in 1753. Manchester also has a long-standing Jewish community: the now-demolished 1857 Manchester Reform Synagogue was the second Reform synagogue in the country, and Greater Manchester has the only eruv in the United Kingdom outside London. Traditionally, there is also a large Jewish presence in Gateshead. In total, there are 84 synagogues in Northern England registered for marriages. Spiritualism flourished in Northern England in the nineteenth century, in part as a backlash to the fundamentalist Primitive Methodist movement and in part driven by the influence of Owenist socialism. There remain 220 Spiritualist churches registered in the North, of which 40 identify as Christian Spiritualist. The first mosque in the United Kingdom was founded by the convert Abdullah Quilliam in the Liverpool Muslim Institute in 1889. Today, there are around 500 mosques in Northern England. The exact count is 591, but Naqshbandi estimates that around 20% of mosques in his list are defunct. Indian religions are also represented: there are at least 45 gurdwaras, of which the largest is the Sikh Temple in Leeds, and 30 mandirs, of which the largest is Bradford Lakshmi Narayan Hindu Temple. Transport Transport in the North has been shaped by the Pennines, creating strong north‚Äìsouth axes along each coast and an east‚Äìwest axis across the moorland passes of the southern Pennines. Northern England is a centre of freight transport and handles around one third of all British cargo. Both passenger and freight links between Northern cities remain poor, which is a major weakness of the Northern economy. The passenger transport executive (PTE) has become a major player in the organisation of public transport within Northern city regions; of the six PTEs in England, five (Transport for Greater Manchester, Merseytravel, Travel South Yorkshire, Nexus Tyne and Wear and West Yorkshire Metro) are located in the North. These coordinate bus services, local trains and light rail in their regions. Following the passage of the Cities and Local Government Devolution Act 2016, Transport for the North became a statutory body in 2018 with powers to coordinate services and offer integrated ticketing throughout the region. Road upright=1.2 The Preston By-pass, opened in 1958, was the first motorway in the UK, and today an extensive network connects the major cities of the North. The main western route through the North is the M6, part of a chain of motorways from London to Glasgow, while the main eastern motorway is the M1/A1(M), which runs as far north as Newcastle. The M62 links Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds and Hull across the Pennines. Other trans-Pennine roads are comparatively minor, and the lack of any dual-carriageway connection between the east and west coasts anywhere in England north of the M62 has been identified by the Department for Transport as a significant hindrance to the Northern economy. In many cases, modern roads still follow ancient routes: the M62 motorway effectively duplicates the Roman road between York and Chester, while the Great North Road, the stagecoach route from London to Scotland, became the modern A1 road. Buses are an important part of the Northern transport mix, with bus ridership above the England and Wales average in all three Northern regions. Many of the municipal bus companies were located in Northern England, and the region saw intense competition and bus wars following deregulation in the 1980s and 1990s. Increasing car ownership in the same era caused bus use to decline, although it remains higher than in most areas of the South. Rail Prestonalt=Two trains ‚Äì one modern, and one from the eighties ‚Äì in a Victorian railway station. The North of England pioneered rail transport. Milestones include the 1758 Middleton Railway in Leeds, the first railway authorised by Act of Parliament and the oldest continually operating in the world; the 1825 Stockton and Darlington Railway, the first public railway to use steam locomotives; and the 1830 Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the first modern main line. Today the region retains many of its original railway lines, including the East Coast and West Coast main lines and the Cross Country Route. Passenger numbers on Northern routes increased over 50% between 2004 and 2016, and Northern England handles over half of total UK rail freight, but infrastructure is poorly funded compared to Southern railways: railways in London received ¬£5426 per resident in 2015 while those in the North East received just ¬£223 per resident, and journeys between major cities are slow and overcrowded. To combat this, the Department of Transport has devolved many of its powers to Rail North, an alliance of local authorities from the Scottish Borders down to Staffordshire which manages the Northern Rail and TransPennine Express franchises that operate many routes in Northern England. Meanwhile, new build such as the Northern Hub around Manchester, High Speed 2 from Manchester and Leeds to London and Northern Powerhouse Rail from Liverpool to Hull and Newcastle is planned to increase capacity on important Northern routes and decrease travel times. The first tram line in the United Kingdom was built in Birkenhead and opened on 30 August 1860 (partially open intermittently as a heritage tramway). Trams turned out to be especially well suited for Northern cities, with their growing working-class suburbs, and by the turn of the century, most Northern towns had an extensive interconnected electric tram network. At the network's height, it was possible to travel entirely by tram from Liverpool Pier Head to the village of Summit, outside Rochdale, a distance of , and a gap of only separated the North-Western network from the West Yorkshire network. Starting in the 1930s, these were largely replaced by motor buses and trolley buses. With the closure of Sheffield Tramway in 1960 and Glasgow Tramway in 1962, Blackpool Tramway ‚Äì popular as a tourist attraction as much as a means of transport ‚Äì was left as the only public tram system in the UK until the Manchester Metrolink opened in 1992. Today there are four light rail systems in the North ‚Äì Blackpool Tramway, Manchester Metrolink, Sheffield Supertram and Tyne & Wear Metro. Air Manchester Airport serves as the main international hub for Northern England and is the busiest airport anywhere in the UK outside London, handling 27.8 million people in 2017. In total, there are eight international airports in the North; these are (in descending order of passenger traffic) Manchester, Newcastle, Liverpool John Lennon, Leeds Bradford, Doncaster Sheffield, Humberside, Teesside and Carlisle Lake District. Many of these airports were developed during the boom in low-cost air travel during the early 2000s, but have suffered since the Great Recession ‚Äì Teesside is running at just 3% of its maximum capacity, and Blackpool Airport closed as an international airport in 2014. The devolution of Air Passenger Duty to Scotland represents a further possible threat to Northern English airports, allowing Scottish airports to offer cheaper flights than their English rivals. Few spoke flights operate between Northern airports and the national hubs at Heathrow and Gatwick, putting further strain on the smaller Northern airports and forcing connecting passengers to travel via continental European airports. The planned High Speed 2 station at Manchester Airport will offer direct high-speed services to London, allowing spare capacity at Manchester Airport to take some of the flights which currently serve busy London airports. Water MV Horizon and Manx ferry HSC Manannan in Liverpool Cruise Terminalalt=A large cruise ship and smaller high-speed ferry in central Liverpoolupright=1.2 The first modern canal in England was Sankey Brook, opened in 1757 to connect Liverpool's ports to the St Helens coalfields. By 1777, the Grand Trunk Canal had opened, linking the rivers Mersey and Trent and making it possible for boats to travel directly from Liverpool on the west coast to Hull on the east coast. Manchester, inland, was connected to the Irish Sea by the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894, although the canal never saw the success that was hoped for. The North retains many navigable canals, including the Cheshire, North Pennine and South Pennine canal rings, although they are now used mostly for pleasure rather than transport ‚Äì the Aire and Calder Navigation, which carries over 2 million tons of oil, sand and gravel per year, is a rare exception. Many Northern coastal towns were built on trade, and retain large sea ports.

Over time, it became more national in scope, publishing many noteworthy articles on American culture by writers such as Tom Wolfe, Jimmy Breslin, Nora Ephron, John Heilemann, Frank Rich, and Rebecca Traister. In its 21st-century incarnation under editor-in-chief Adam Moss, \\"The nation's best and most-imitated city magazine is often not about the city‚Äîat least not in the overcrowded, traffic-clogged, five-boroughs sense\\", wrote then Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, as the magazine has increasingly published political and cultural stories of national significance. Since its redesign and relaunch in 2004, the magazine has won more National Magazine Awards than any other publication, including the 2013 award for Magazine of the Year. It was one of the first dual-audience \\"lifestyle magazines\\", and its format and style have been emulated by some other American regional city publications. In 2009, its paid and verified circulation was 408,622, with 95.8% of that coming from subscriptions.

The Paper: The Life and Death of the New York Herald Tribune. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. . OCLC 13643103, p. 679. as the Sunday-magazine supplement of the New York Herald Tribune newspaper. Edited first by Sheldon Zalaznick and then by Clay Felker, the magazine showcased the work of several talented Tribune contributors, including Tom Wolfe, Barbara Goldsmith, and Jimmy Breslin. Soon after the Tribune went out of business in 1966‚Äì67, Felker and his partner, Milton Glaser, purchased the rights with money loaned to them by C. Gerald Goldsmith (Barbara Goldsmith's husband at the time), and reincarnated the magazine as a stand-alone glossy. Joining them was managing editor Jack Nessel, Felker's number-two at the Herald Tribune. New York's first issue was dated April 8, 1968. Among the by-lines were many familiar names from the magazine's earlier incarnation, including Breslin, Wolfe (who wrote \\"You and Your Big Mouth: How the Honks and Wonks Reveal the Phonetic Truth about Status\\" in the inaugural issue), and George Goodman, a financial writer who wrote as \\"Adam Smith\\". Within a year, Felker had assembled a team of contributors who would come to define the magazine's voice. Breslin became a regular, as did Gloria Steinem, who wrote the city-politics column, and Gail Sheehy. (Sheehy would eventually marry Felker, in 1984.) Harold Clurman was hired as the theater critic. Judith Crist wrote movie reviews. Alan Rich covered the classical-music scene. Barbara Goldsmith was a Founding Editor of New York magazine and the author of the widely imitated series, \\"The Creative Environment\\", in which she interviewed such subjects as Marcel Breuer, I. M. Pei, George Balanchine, and Pablo Picasso about their creative process. Gael Greene, writing under the rubric \\"The Insatiable Critic\\", reviewed restaurants, cultivating a baroque writing style that leaned heavily on sexual metaphor. Woody Allen contributed a few stories for the magazine in its early years. The magazine's regional focus and innovative illustrations inspired numerous imitators across the country. The office for the magazine was on the top floor of the old Tammany Hall clubhouse at 207 East 32nd Street, which Glaser owned. 1970s Wolfe, a regular contributor to the magazine, wrote a story in 1970 that captured the spirit of the magazine (if not the age): \\"Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's\\". The article described a benefit party for the Black Panthers, held in Leonard Bernstein's apartment, in a collision of high culture and low that paralleled New York magazine's ethos. In 1972, New York, after a lot of convincing by Gloria Steinem, also launched Ms. magazine, which began as a special issue. New West, a sister magazine on New York model that covered California life, was also published for a few years in the 1970s. As the 1970s progressed, Felker continued to broaden the magazine's editorial vision beyond Manhattan, covering Richard Nixon and the Watergate scandal closely. In 1976, journalist Nik Cohn contributed a story called \\"Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night,\\" about a young man in a working-class Brooklyn neighborhood who, once a week, went to a local disco called Odyssey 2001; the story was a sensation and served as the basis for the film Saturday Night Fever. Twenty years later, Cohn admitted that he'd done no more than drive by Odyssey's door, and that he'd made the rest up. It was a recurring problem of what Wolfe, in 1972, had labeled \\"The New Journalism.\\" In 1976, the Australian media baron Rupert Murdoch bought the magazine in a hostile takeover, forcing Felker and Glaser out. A succession of editors followed, including Joe Armstrong and John Berendt. 1980s In 1980, Murdoch hired Edward Kosner, who had worked at Newsweek. Murdoch also bought Cue, a listings magazine founded by Mort Glankoff that had covered the city since 1932, and folded it into New York, simultaneously creating a useful going-out guide and eliminating a competitor. Kosner's magazine tended toward a mix of newsmagazine-style stories, trend pieces, and pure \\"service\\" features‚Äîlong articles on shopping and other consumer subjects‚Äîas well as close coverage of the glitzy 1980s New York City scene epitomized by financiers Donald Trump and Saul Steinberg. The magazine was profitable for most of the 1980s. The term \\"the Brat Pack\\" was coined for a 1985 story in the magazine.Blum, David, \\"Hollywood's Brat Pack\\", June 10, 1985, pp. 40‚Äì47. 1990s Murdoch got out of the magazine business in 1991 by selling his holdings to K-III Communications, a partnership controlled by financier Henry Kravis. In 1993, budget pressure from K-III frustrated Kosner, and he left for Esquire magazine. After several months' search, during which the magazine was run by managing editor Peter Herbst, K-III hired Kurt Andersen, the co-creator of Spy, a humor monthly of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Andersen quickly replaced several staff members, bringing in many emerging and established writers (including Jim Cramer, Walter Kirn, Michael Tomasky, and Jacob Weisberg) and editors (including Michael Hirschorn, Kim France, Dany Levy, and Maer Roshan), and generally making the magazine faster-paced, younger in outlook, and more knowing in tone. In August 1996, Bill Reilly fired Andersen from his editorship, citing the publication's financial results. According to Andersen, he was fired for refusing to kill a story about a rivalry between investment bankers Felix Rohatyn and Steven Rattner that had upset Henry Kravis, a member of the firm's ownership group. His replacement was Caroline Miller, who came from Seventeen, another K-III title. 2000s In 2002 and 2003, Michael Wolff, the media critic hired by Miller in 1998, won two National Magazine Awards for his column. At the end of 2003, New York was sold again, to financier Bruce Wasserstein, for $55 million. Wasserstein replaced Miller with Adam Moss, known for editing the short-lived New York weekly of the late 1980s 7 Days and The New York Times Magazine. In late 2004 the magazine was relaunched, most notably with two new sections: \\"The Strategist\\", devoted mostly to utility, and \\"The Culture Pages\\", covering the city's arts scene. Moss also rehired Kurt Andersen as a columnist. In early 2006, the company began an aggressive digital expansion with the relaunch of the magazine's website, previously nymetro.com, as nymag.com. Since 2004, the magazine has won twenty four National Magazine Awards, more than any other magazine over this time period,Flamm, Matthew.

During this same period it has been a finalist an additional 48 times in categories that included Profile Writing, Reviews and Criticism, Commentary, Public Service, Magazine Section, Leisure Interests, Personal Service, Single-Topic Issue, Photography, Photojournalism, Photo Portfolio, and Design. In 2007, when the magazine for the first time dominated the awards, much of the coverage the next day noted that The New Yorker took home no awards that night, despite receiving nine nominations, and also noted that New York was the first magazine to win for both its print and Internet editions in the same year. The February 25, 2008 issue featured a series of nude photographs of Lindsay Lohan. Shot by Bert Stern, the series replicated several poses from Stern's widely reproduced final photos of Marilyn Monroe, shot shortly before the actress's fatal drug overdose. That week, the magazine's website received over 60 million hits and with traffic 2000 percent higher than usual. The magazine is especially known for its food writing (its restaurant critic Adam Platt won a James Beard Award in 2009, and its Underground Gourmet critics Rob Patronite and Robin Raisfeld have won two National Magazine Awards); and for its political coverage, especially John Heilemann's reporting on the 2008 presidential election, which led to his (and Mark Halperin's) best-selling book Game Change, and for coverage of the first two years of the Obama administration; The New Republic praised its \\"hugely impressive political coverage\\" during this period. The magazine's current stable of writers includes national political columnist and correspondent John Heilemann, Steve Fishman, Jesse Green, Vanessa Grigoriadis, Joe Hagan, Mark Jacobson, Jennifer Senior, Gabriel Sherman, Christopher Smith, and Jonathan Van Meter. Its culture critics include David Edelstein (movies), Matt Zoller Seitz(TV), Jerry Saltz (art), who won the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism in 2018, Justin Davidson (classical music and architecture), and Kathryn Schulz (books), who won the National Book Critics Circle's Nona Balakian Citation for Excellence in Reviewing in 2012. New York has been widely recognized for its design during this period, with back-to-back design wins at the National Magazine Awards and Magazine of the Year wins from the Society of Publication Designers (SPD) in 2006 and 2007. The 2008 Eliot Spitzer \\"Brain\\" cover was named Cover of the Year by the American Society of Magazine Editors (ASME) and Advertising Age and 2009's \\"Bernie Madoff, Monster\\" was named Best News & Business Cover by ASME. New York won back-to- back ASME Cover of the Year awards in 2012 and 2013, for \\"Is She Just Too Old for This?\\" and \\"The City and the Storm\\" respectively. Design director Chris Dixon and photography director Jody Quon were named \\"Design Team of the Year\\" by Adweek in 2008. In 2009, after Bruce Wasserstein's death, the magazine's ownership passed to his family. Many obituaries noted Wasserstein's revival of the magazine. \\"While previous owners had required constant features in the magazine about the best place to get a croissant or a beret,\\" wrote David Carr of The New York Times, \\"it was clear that Wasserstein wanted a publication that was the best place to learn about the complicated apparatus that is modern New York. In enabling as much, Mr. Wasserstein recaptured the original intent of the magazine's founder, Clay Felker.\\" 2010s On March 1, 2011, it was announced that Frank Rich would leave The New York Times to become an essayist and editor-at-large for New York. Rich began his relationship with the magazine starting in June 2011. New Yorks \\"Encyclopedia of 9/11\\", published on the tenth anniversary of the attacks, was widely praised, with Gizmodo calling it \\"heartbreaking, locked in the past, and entirely current\\"; the issue won a National Magazine Award for Single-Topic Issue. New Yorks offices in lower Manhattan were without electricity in the week following Hurricane Sandy, so the editorial staff published an issue from the midtown office of Wasserstein & Company, the firm that owns New York Media. The issue's cover, shot by photographer Iwan Baan from a helicopter and showing Manhattan half in darkness, almost immediately became an iconic image of the storm, and was named the magazine cover of the year by Time. The photograph on the cover was published as a poster by the Museum of Modern Art, with proceeds benefiting Hurricane Sandy relief efforts. In 2013, New York magazine took the top honor at the National Magazine Awards again receiving magazine of the year for its print and digital coverage. In December 2013, the magazine announced plans to move to a biweekly format in March 2014, reducing from 42 annual issues to 29. Jared Hohlt became top editor of the printed magazine in 2014. In April 2016, the magazine announced the launch of Select All, a new vertical dedicated to technology and innovation. In 2019, Select All was shuttered and folded into the broadened \\"Intelligencer\\" news site. In December 2018, New Yorks fashion and beauty destination site \\"the Cut\\", carried a piece titled \\"Is Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas' Love for Real?\\", that drew severe backlash from readers for accusing Priyanka Chopra of trapping Nick Jonas into a fraudulent relationship and being a \\"global scam artist\\". The publication removed the piece the following morning and issued an apology. In January 2019, Moss announced that he was retiring from the editorship. David Haskell, one of his chief deputies, succeeded him as editor on April 1, 2019. That same spring, the magazine laid off staff members and temps. On September 24th, 2019, Vox Media announced it purchased New York Magazine, and its parent company, New York Media. In May 2020, Vox Media announced it was merging the real estate site Curbed, into New York magazine. Puzzles and competitions New York magazine was once known for its competitions and unique crossword puzzles. For the first year of the magazine's existence, the composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim contributed an extremely complex cryptic crossword to every third issue. In the style of British crosswords (as they are sometimes called), the cryptic crosswords feature clues that include a straight definition and a wordplay definition. Richard Maltby, Jr. took over thereafter. Since 1980, the magazine has also run an American-style crossword. For the first 30 years the puzzle was always by Maura Jacobson, but beginning in the summer of 2010, Cathy Allis Millhauser's byline began appearing in alternate weeks, and the magazine announced her as permanent co-constructor in September 2010. Jacobson retired in April 2011, having created 1,400 puzzles for the magazine, including 30 years when she wrote a puzzle every single week without missing an issue.Staff. \\"An Appreciation: Thirty-one Down; After three decades‚Äìplus of puzzle-making, Maura B. Jacobson is retiring.\\", New York, April 24, 2011.

In the remaining two weeks out of every three, Sondheim's friend Mary Ann Madden editedCat People, Bill Hayward, introduction by Rogers E. M. Whitaker. New York: Dolphin/Doubleday, 1978 (p. 52) an extremely popular witty literary competition calling for readers to send in humorous poetry or other bits of wordplay on a theme that changed with each installment. (A typical entry, in a competition calling for humorous epitaphs, supplied this one for Geronimo: \\"Requiescat in Apache.\\") Altogether, Madden ran 973 installments of the competition, retiring in 2000. Hundreds, sometimes thousands, of entries were received each week, and winners included David Mamet, Herb Sargent, and Dan Greenburg. David Halberstam once claimed that he had submitted entries 137 times without winning. Sondheim, Woody Allen, and Nora Ephron were fans. The Competition's demise, when Madden retired, was greatly lamented among its fans. In August 2000, the magazine published a letter from an Irish contestant, John O'Byrne, who wrote: \\"How I'll miss the fractured definitions, awful puns, conversation stoppers, one- letter misprints, ludicrous proverbs, openings of bad novels, near misses, et al. (what a nice guy Al is!).\\" Many entrants have since migrated to The Washington Posts similar \\"Style Invitational\\" feature. Three volumes of Competition winners were published, titled Thank You for the Giant Sea Tortoise, Son of Giant Sea Tortoise, and Maybe He's Dead: And Other Hilarious Results of New York Magazine Competitions.  Digital expansion and destination sites  In 2006, New Yorks website, nymag.com, underwent a year- long relaunch, transforming the site from a magazine companion to an up-to- the-minute news and service destination. In 2008, parent company New York Media purchased the online restaurant and menu resource MenuPages, which serves eight markets across the U.S., as a complement to its own online restaurant listings and to gain a foothold in seven additional cities. In 2011, MenuPages was sold to Seamless.

A flux density of one Wb/m2 (one weber per square metre) is one tesla. The weber is named after the German physicist Wilhelm Eduard Weber (1804‚Äì1891).  Definition  The weber may be defined in terms of Faraday's law, which relates a changing magnetic flux through a loop to the electric field around the loop. A change in flux of one weber per second will induce an electromotive force of one volt (produce an electric potential difference of one volt across two open-circuited terminals). Officially: The weber is commonly expressed in a multitude of other units: :\\\\mathrm{Wb} =\\\\dfrac{\\\\mathrm{kg}{\\\\cdot}\\\\mathrm{m}^2}{\\\\mathrm{s}^2{\\\\cdot}\\\\mathrm{A}} =\\\\Omega {\\\\cdot} \\\\text{C} =\\\\mathrm{V}{\\\\cdot}\\\\mathrm{s} =\\\\mathrm{H}{\\\\cdot}\\\\mathrm{A} =\\\\mathrm{T}{\\\\cdot}\\\\mathrm{m}^2 =\\\\dfrac{\\\\mathrm{J}}{\\\\mathrm{A}} =\\\\dfrac{\\\\mathrm{N}{\\\\cdot}\\\\mathrm{m}}{\\\\mathrm{A}} =10^8\\\\mathrm{Mx} where Wb = weber, Œ© = ohm, C = coulomb, V = volt, T = tesla, J = joule, N = newton m = metre, s = second, A = ampere, H = henry, Mx = maxwell.  History  In 1861, the British Association for the Advancement of Science (known as \\"The BA\\" ) established a committee under William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) to study electrical units. In a February 1902 manuscript, with handwritten notes of Oliver Heaviside, Giovanni Giorgi proposed a set of rational units of electromagnetism including the weber, noting that \\"the product of the volt into the second has been called the weber by the B. A.\\" The International Electrotechnical Commission began work on terminology in 1909 and established Technical Committee 1 in 1911, its oldest established committee, \\"to sanction the terms and definitions used in the different electrotechnical fields and to determine the equivalence of the terms used in the different languages.\\" In 1930, TC1 decided that the magnetic field strength (H) is of a different nature from the magnetic flux density (B), and took up the question of naming the units for these fields and related quantities, among them the integral of magnetic flux density. In 1935, TC 1 recommended names for several electrical units, including the weber for the practical unit of magnetic flux (and the maxwell for the CGS unit). :This page incorrectly states that the units were established in 1930, since that year, TC 1 decided \\"that the question of names to be allocated to magnetic units should not be considered until general agreement had been reached on their definitions\\" Also in 1935, TC1 passed responsibility for \\"electric and magnetic magnitudes and units\\" to the new TC24. This \\"led eventually to the universal adoption of the Giorgi system, which unified electromagnetic units with the MKS dimensional system of units, the whole now known simply as the SI system (Syst√®me International d'unit√©s).\\" In 1938, TC24 \\"recommended as a connecting link [from mechanical to electrical units] the permeability of free space with the value of Œº0 = 4œÄ H/m. This group also recognized that any one of the practical units already in use (ohm, ampere, volt, henry, farad, coulomb, and weber), could equally serve as the fourth fundamental unit. \\"After consultation, the ampere was adopted as the fourth unit of the Giorgi system in Paris in 1950.\\"  Notes and references  SI derived units Units of magnetic flux ","title":"Weber (unit)"},{"id":"714713","text":"Deborah Elizabeth Meyer (born August 14, 1952), also known by her married name Deborah Weber, is an American former competition swimmer, a three-time Olympic champion, and a former world record-holder in four events.

Many consider the area to have a distinct identity from the rest of England, however without universal agreement on what cultural, political, and economic characteristics of the South are. For statistical purposes, Southern England is divided into four regions: South West England, South East England, London, and the East of England. Combined, these have a total area of , and a population of 28 million. People People often apply the terms \\"southern\\" and \\"south\\" loosely, without deeper consideration of the geographical identities of Southern England. This can cause confusion over the depth of affiliation between its areas. As in much of the rest of England, people tend to have a deeper affiliation to their county or city. Thus, residents of Essex are unlikely to feel much affinity with people in Oxfordshire. Similarly, there is a strong distinction between natives of the south-west and south- east. The broadcaster Stuart Maconie has noted that culturally \\"there's a bottom half of England [...] but there isn't a south in the same way that there's a north\\". Health upright=1.2 One major manifestation of the North‚ÄìSouth divide is in health and life expectancy statistics. All three Northern England statistical regions have lower than average life expectancies and higher than average rates of cancer, circulatory disease and respiratory disease. The South of England has a higher life expectancy than the North, however, regional differences do seem to be slowly narrowing: between 1991‚Äì1993 and 2012‚Äì2014, life expectancy in the North East increased by 6.0 years and in the North West by 5.8 years, the fastest increase in any region outside London, and the gap between life expectancy in the North East and South East is now 2.5 years, down from 2.9 in 1993. Furthermore, all such figures represent an average - affluent northern towns such as Harrogate have higher life expectancies than less affluent areas of the South such as Southampton or Plymouth. Sport Rugby The sport of rugby experienced a schism in 1895 with many teams based in Yorkshire, Lancashire and surrounding areas breaking from the Rugby Football Union and forming their own League. The disagreement that led to the split was over the issue of professional payments, and \\"broken time\\" or injury payments. There is a perception that league is the code of rugby played in the north, whilst union is the code played in the south. One of the biggest derbies in Southern England is the West Country derby (Bath v Gloucester). Football The South Coast Derby is used to describe football matches played mainly between Portsmouth Football Club and Southampton Football Club. However in Portsmouth's absence from top flight football, AFC Bournemouth and Brighton and Hove Albion ‚Äì based about and from Southampton respectively ‚Äì gained promotion to the Premier League, with some media outlets marketing fixtures against them as a South Coast derby;AFC Bournemouth: What should we call the derby between Cherries and Southampton?, Bournemouth Daily Echo, 30 October 2015Southampton snatch equaliser against Brighton in the south coast derby but remain in the relegation zone, The Independent, 31 January 2018Bournemouth against Southampton the ‚Äúother‚Äù South Coast Derby, Vital Football, 18 October 2018 Other major derbies in Southern England are West Country derbies and London derbies. Divisions In most definitions, Southern England includes all the counties on/near the English Channel. In terms of the current ceremonial counties: * Bristol * Cornwall * Devon * Dorset * Hampshire * Isle of Wight * Oxfordshire * West Sussex * East Sussex * Kent * Somerset * Wiltshire * Berkshire * Gloucestershire * Surrey * Greater London * Hertfordshire Despite the general acceptance of these counties as Southern, those that compose the West Country are occasionally considered mutually exclusive to Southern England. The exact northern extent varies and as with most geographical regions, people sometimes debate the boundaries. In the west, Southern England is generally taken to include Gloucestershire and Oxfordshire; in central Southern England, the counties of Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire; to the east, Essex and the counties of East Anglia (Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and Suffolk). For a period of time between the 16th and 20th Centuries, the county of Monmouthshire in Wales was often considered English due to both politics and the result of these having a cultural impact on the people who lived there. Therefore, in these instances it was grouped with southern England due to its border with Gloucestershire. Despite these definitions, the northern boundary is generally taken to correspond to an imaginary line from the Severn Estuary to the Wash (or expressed in terms of towns, from Gloucester to King's Lynn). Historic counties The historic counties ceased to be used for any administrative purpose in 1899 but remain important to some people, notably for county cricket.      * See also * Constitutional status of Cornwall * European Parliament constituencies in the United Kingdom * Home Counties * North‚ÄìSouth divide in England * North‚ÄìSouth divide in the United Kingdom * Regions of England * Subdivisions of England References Regions of England ","title":"Southern England"},{"id":"714743","text":"Location of Astrakhan Oblast in Russia Location of Samara Oblast in Russia Krasnoyarsky District is the name of several administrative and municipal districts in Russia: *Krasnoyarsky District, Astrakhan Oblast, an administrative and municipal district of Astrakhan Oblast *Krasnoyarsky District, Samara Oblast, an administrative and municipal district of Samara Oblast See also *Krasnoyarsky (disambiguation) *Krasnoyarsk Krai, a federal subject of Russia References ","title":"Krasnoyarsky District"},{"id":"714746","text":"Location of Kursk Oblast in Russia Location of Stavropol Krai in Russia Kursky District is the name of several administrative and municipal districts in Russia: *Kursky District, Kursk Oblast, an administrative and municipal district of Kursk Oblast *Kursky District, Stavropol Krai, an administrative and municipal district of Stavropol Krai See also *Kursky (disambiguation) References ","title":"Kursky District"},{"id":"714749","text":"Brand-name Spezi Generic \\"Spezi\\" mix of beverages Spezi is the brand name for a soft drink owned by Brauhaus Riegele in Augsburg, Germany.Brand register Spezi is a genericized trademark and the name is used as a generic term for a mixture of Cola and orange soda in most German speaking countries.

Early life and marriage Watson was born in Frankfort, Kentucky, a son of U.S. Navy Commander John Crittendon Watson. He married Hermine Cary Gratz, whose half-sister, Helen Gratz, married Godfrey S. Rockefeller of Greenwich, Connecticut. Navy career Academy and early career Watson graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in June 1895 and served on several ships during the rest of the decade, including Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War service on board the cruiser . He commanded the storeship in 1912‚Äì13, then attended the Naval War College. Watson also saw duty as executive officer of the battleship and as Commanding Officer of the gunboat . World War I During World War I, Watson was in command of the battleship , receiving the Navy Cross. In March 1919, he became U.S. Naval Attach√© in Japan, remaining in that post until May 1922. In July of that year, he took command of Destroyer Squadron 11, based on the West Coast. Honda Point disaster On September 8, 1923, dead reckoning navigation errors on Watson's flagship led seven of his squadron's destroyers to ground on the rocky coast at Honda Point, California, a loss that came to be known as the Honda Point Disaster. Watson was court martialed for his role. Not all observers agreed with the Navy's decision to punish Watson. The editors of the Army and Navy Journal wrote, \\"Captain Watson has given a splendid example of the finest attributes of character overcoming the elemental instinct of self-preservation. Voluntarily waiving the fundamental right of a defendant to place the burden of proof upon the prosecution, and to refrain from testifying under oath to any facts that might tend to incriminate himself, he took the witness stand and not only freely testified to facts relating to his own culpability but also volunteered his opinion under oath that he was wholly responsible for the disaster, and that none of his subordinates should be blamed.\\" In 1960, the authors of Tragedy at Honda argued that Watson displayed outstanding honor and leadership in taking responsibility when the causes of the tragedy lay in new technology, fog and a series of small errors resulting in the fleet not being where its navigators believed it should be. Post-Honda Point career and retirement After the Honda Point disaster, Watson served as Assistant Commandant of the Fourteenth Naval District in Hawaii until he left active duty in November 1929. He retired to New York City, where he was in the New York Social Register. He and his family spent their summers on Walcott Avenue in Jamestown, Rhode Island, where he was a member of the Conanicut Yacht Club. Death Watson died in 1942 in Brooklyn, New York.

The station is served by Southern and by ThamesLink.  History  A 1905 Railway Clearing House map of lines around Coulsdon South railway station Coulsdon is on a stretch of line between Croydon and Redhill which the UK Parliament insisted should be shared by the London and Brighton Railway (L&BR;) route to Brighton, and the South Eastern Railway (SER) route to Dover. As a result, there have been a number of railway stations at Coulsdon. Coulsdon South Coulsdon South in 1971 with a Class 423 at platform 2 This station was opened by the South Eastern Railway (SER) on 1 October 1889. The line is on a steep gradient climbing towards Merstham Tunnel. It is from , and has two platforms each long enough for a 12-coach train. It was originally called Coulsdon and Cane Hill, referring to the nearby psychiatric hospital: a covered way connected the station to the hospital. By the 1960s, the covered way had been removed. Ticketing The station remains staffed for most of the operational day, with a booking office located on the up (west) side of the station. At the entrance to the ticket office from the station approach road, there are two self-service ticket machines, one of which, most unusually, is wall-mounted. A PERTIS self-service 'Permit to Travel' ticket machine was previously provided here but has been removed. Automatic Ticket Barriers were installed at the station in spring 2011 Other stations in Coulsdon *Stoats Nest for Coulsdon and Cane Hill (later Coulsdon North) was opened on 8 November 1899, by the LB&SCR; on their Quarry Line which bypassed Redhill. It closed 3 October 1983. * Smitham (later Coulsdon Town) was opened in 1904 by the SER on their Tattenham Corner Line and is named after another nearby settlement. This station was renamed from Smitham in 2011 as part of Southern Railway's new franchise agreement. This change was made as a result of a local consultation carried out by Croydon Council and it intended to better reflect the location of the station near Coulsdon town centre. Recent history In May 2019, work began to install a new accessible footbridge with lifts and tactile paving. The work was completed in August 2020 having been delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.

They were part of a hereditary line of rulers, the noho ali ªi. The word ali ªi has a similar meaning in the Samoan language and other Polynesian languages, and in MƒÅori it is pronounced \\"ariki\\". Background In ancient Hawaiian society, the ali ªi were hereditary nobles (a social class or caste). The ali ªi consisted of the higher and lesser chiefs of the various levels on the islands. The noho ali ªi were the ruling chiefs. The ali ªi were believed to be descended from the deities. They governed with divine power called mana, which was derived from the spiritual energy of their ancestors. There were eleven classes of ali ªi, of both men and women. These included the kahuna (priestesses and priests, experts, craftsmen, and canoe makers) as part of four professions practiced by the nobility. Each island had its own ali ªi nui, who governed their individual systems. Ali ªi continued to play a role in the governance of the Hawaiian islands until 1893, when Queen Lili ªuokalani was overthrown by a coup d'√©tat backed by the United States government. Ali ªi nui were ruling chiefs (in Hawaiian, nui means grand, great, or supreme.). The nui title could be passed on by right of birth. Social designations of noho ali ªi (ruling line) Samuel M. Kamakau writes extensively about the ali ªi nui and kaukau ali ªi lines and their importance to Hawaiian history. *Ali ªi nui were supreme high chiefs of an island and no others were above them (during the Kingdom period this title would come to mean \\"Governor\\"). The four largest Hawaiian islands (Hawai ªi proper, Maui, Kaua ªi, and O ªahu) were usually ruled each by their own ali ªi nui. Moloka ªi also had a line of island rulers, but was later subjected to the superior power of nearby Maui and O ªahu during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. M≈ç ªƒ´ was a special title for the highest chief of the island of Maui. Later, the title was used for all rulers of the Hawaiian Islands and the Hawaiian monarchs. *Ali ªi nui kapu were sacred rulers with special taboos. *Ali ªi Pi ªo were a rank of chiefs who were products of full blood sibling unions. Famous Pi ªo chiefs were the royal twins, Kameeiamoku and Kamanawa. *Ali ªi Naha were a rank of chiefs who were products of half-blood sibling unions; famous Naha chiefs include Keopuolani. *Ali ªi Wohi were a rank of chiefs who were products of marriage of close relatives other than siblings; one famous Wohi chief was Kamehameha I. These chiefs possessed the kapu wohi, exempting them from kapu moe (prostration taboo). *Kaukau ali ªi were lesser chiefs who served the ali ªi nui. It is a relative term and not a fixed level of ali ªi nobility. The expression is elastic in terms of how it is used. In general, it means a relative who is born from a lesser ranking parent. A kaukau ali ªi son's own children, if born of a lesser ranking ali ªi mother, would descend to a lower rank. Eventually the line descends, leading to maka ªƒÅinana (commoner). Kaukauali ªi gain rank through marriage with higher-ranking ali ªi. One kaukau ali ªi line descended from Moana KƒÅne, son of Keakealanikane, became secondary ali ªi to the Kamehameha rulers of the kingdom and were responsible for various hana lawelawe (service tasks). Members of this line married into the Kamehamehas, including Charles Kana ªina and Kek≈´anƒÅo ªa. Some bore KƒÅhili, royal standards made of feathers, and were attendants of the higher-ranking ali ªi. During the monarchy some of these chiefs were elevated to positions within the primary political bodies of the Hawaiian legislature and the king's Privy Council. All Hawaiian monarchs after Kamehameha III were the children of Kaukauali ªi fathers who married higher ranking wives.

The Hawaii State Library building is located in downtown Honolulu adjacent to Iolani Palace and the Hawaii State Capitol. Originally funded by Andrew Carnegie, the building was designed by architect Henry D. Whitfield. Groundbreaking took place in 1911 and construction was completed in 1913. In 1978, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places, as a contributing property within the Hawaii Capital Historic District. The building holds over 525,000 cataloged books. The entire Hawaii State Public Library System has a collection of over 3 million books. Nearby is the Hawaii State Archives which holds book collections of historical significance to Hawaii. The Edna Allyn Children's Room houses murals by artist Juliette May Fraser depicting Hawaiian legends while the garden courtyard features a mosaic of ocean currents by Hiroki Morinoue. Barbara Hepworth's cast bronze sculptures called Parent I and Young Girl greet visitors at the lawn in front of the building. History Before the Hawaii State Library was constructed, library facilities were provided by the Honolulu Library and Reading Room Association founded in 1879 by the Kingdom of Hawaii. Prior to this, the site was the location of HƒÅli ªimaile, the residence of Boki and Liliha and later Victoria KamƒÅmalu and her father and brothers before they ascended Kamehameha IV and Kamehameha V. Hawaii‚Äôs royalty (King Kalakaua, Queen Kapiolani, Queen Emma, and Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop) gave both financial support and their personal book collections to the association. King Kalakaua also provided tax exemptions and a land grant for a permanent site in downtown Honolulu. The Hawaii State Library was funded by a grant from Andrew Carnegie. The Library met the government-related requirements for the grant with the cooperation of Walter F. Frear. Edna Allyn was the head librarian when it opened in 1913. In 1921, the County Library Law established separate libraries on the islands of Kauai, Maui, and Hawaii, under minimal supervision by the Library of Hawaii, which restricted its services to Oahu. Even so, the latter quickly outgrew its quarters. In 1927, the Territorial legislature approved funding to expand and renovate the building. Construction was completed in 1930. Architect C.W. Dickey tripled its size by new wings to create an open- air courtyard in the center. After statehood in 1959, the Hawaii State Legislature created the Hawaii State Public Library System, the only statewide system in the United States, with the Hawaii State Library building as its flagship branch. Throughout the 1970's and 1980's, the library continued to outgrow its facility. In 1990, it funded a second major renovation and expansion, which was completed in 1992. The renovations addressed air- conditioning, roofing, asbestos removal, plumbing, better access for the handicapped, and landscaping, while the expansion added a large wing to the rear of the building that blended well with the older wings.  Library Development in Hawaii  The library system of Hawaii State Library, which was established in June of 1965 called for a new concept of organization that had to be created by the state librarian.HUNT, J. R. (1968). Library development in Hawaii. Wilson Library Bulletin, 42, 810‚Äì811. This system would provide complete service to all aspects of society. Ideas were sourced from other established libraries and organizations, then integrated to create best practices for the library system. Though the Library System is an independent State agency, the state librarian is appointed by the Board of Education and reports directly to the Superintendent of Education. Other government agencies that the state librarian reports to are the seven appointed School Advisory Councils, the four Library Advisory Commission, and others that are engaged in education. The state librarian is responsible for the operation, planning, programming, and budgeting of all public libraries within the State, however, there are no local funds in Hawaii, and as such, the governor and legislature approves the funding and budget of the State Library.

It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and headaches. Rarely numbness, lung problems, or liver problems may occur. It should not be used in people with kidney problems. While it appears to be generally safe during pregnancy it should not be used near delivery. While it usually works by slowing bacterial growth, it may result in bacterial death at the high concentrations found in urine. Nitrofurantoin was first sold in 1953. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 185th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than three million prescriptions. Medical uses 100 mg Macrobid, Canada Current uses include the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) and prophylaxis against UTIs in people prone to recurrent UTIs. Increasing bacterial antibiotic resistance to other commonly used agents, such as fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, has led to increased interest in using nitrofurantoin. The efficacy of nitrofurantoin in treating UTIs combined with a low rate of bacterial resistance to this agent makes it one of the first-line agents for treating uncomplicated UTIs as recommended by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases. Nitrofurantoin is not recommended for the treatment of pyelonephritis, prostatitis, and intra-abdominal abscess, because of extremely poor tissue penetration and low blood levels. Antibacterial activity Nitrofurantoin has been shown to have good activity against: *E. coli *Staphylococcus saprophyticus *Coagulase negative staphylococci *Enterococcus faecalis *Staphylococcus aureus *Streptococcus agalactiae *Citrobacter species *Klebsiella species *Bacillus subtilis species It is used in the treatment of infections caused by these organisms. Many or all strains of the following genera are resistant to nitrofurantoin: *Enterobacter *Proteus *Pseudomonas Antibiotic susceptibility testing should always be performed to further elucidate the resistance profile of the particular strain of bacteria causing infection. Pregnancy Nitrofurantoin is pregnancy category B in the United States and pregnancy category A in Australia. It is one of the few drugs commonly used in pregnancy to treat UTIs. It however should not be used in late pregnancy due to the potential risk of hemolytic anemia in the newborn. Newborns of women given this drug late in pregnancy had a higher risk of developing neonatal jaundice. Evidence of safety in early pregnancy is mixed as of 2017. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states that while they can be used in the first trimester other options may be preferred. They remain a first line treatment in the second trimester. A 2015 meta analysis found no increased risk from first trimester use in cohort studies that was a slight increase of malformations in case control studies. Adverse effects The most common side effects with nitrofurantoin are nausea, headache, and flatulence. Less common adverse events (occurring in less than 1% of those taking the drug) include: *Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, constipation, emesis *Neurologic: dizziness, drowsiness, amblyopia *Respiratory: acute pulmonary hypersensitivity reaction *Allergic: pruritus, urticaria *Dermatologic: hair loss *Miscellaneous: fever, chills, malaise Patients should be informed that nitrofurantoin colours urine brown; this is completely harmless. Some of the more serious but rare side effects of nitrofurantoin have been a cause of concern. These include pulmonary reactions, hepatotoxicity, and neuropathy. Pulmonary toxicity The pulmonary toxicity caused by nitrofurantoin can be categorized into acute, subacute, and chronic pulmonary reactions. The acute and subacute reactions are thought to be due to a hypersensitivity reaction and often resolve when the drug is discontinued. Acute reactions have been estimated to occur in about one in 5000 women who take the drug. These reactions usually develop 3‚Äì8 days after the first dose of nitrofurantoin, but may occur from a few hours to a few weeks after starting the drug. Symptoms include fever, dyspnea, chills, cough, pleuritic chest pain, headache, back pain, and epigastric pain. Chest radiograph will often show unilateral or bilateral infiltrates similar to pulmonary edema. Treatment includes discontinuation of the nitrofurantoin, which should result in symptom improvement within 24 hours. Chronic pulmonary reactions caused by nitrofurantoin include diffuse interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, or both. This uncommon reaction may occur 1 month to 6 years after starting the drug and is usually related to its total lifetime dose. This reaction manifests with progressive shortness of breath. It is important to recognize nitrofurantoin as possible cause of symptoms and discontinue the drug when the suspicion of pulmonary side effects arises as it can be reversible if the drug is stopped early. Hepatotoxicity Hepatic reactions, including hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, chronic active hepatitis, and hepatic necrosis, occur rarely. The onset of chronic active hepatitis may be insidious, and patients should be monitored periodically for changes in biochemical tests that would indicate liver injury. These reactions usually occur after exposure to the drug for more than 6 weeks. If signs of liver failure are observed in a patient taking nitrofurantoin, the drug should be discontinued. Re-challenge with the drug at a later date is not recommended, as the reaction may have a hypersensitivity component and recur when the drug is resumed. Neuropathy Neuropathy is a rare side effect of taking nitrofurantoin. Patients may experience numbness and tingling in a stocking-glove pattern, which may or may not improve upon discontinuation of the drug. Contraindications Nitrofurantoin is contraindicated in patients with decreased renal function (CrCl < 60 ml/min) due to systemic accumulation and subtherapeutic levels reached in the urinary tract. However, a retrospective chart review suggests the data for this cutoff are slim and a cutoff of CrCl < 40 ml/min would be more appropriate. Many of the severe side effects of this drug are more common in the elderly and those with renal impairment, as this causes the drug to be retained in the body and reach higher systemic levels. Thus, the drug is not recommended for the elderly population according to 2012 AGS Beers criteria. Nitrofurantoin is also contraindicated in babies up to the age of one month, as they have immature enzyme systems in their red blood cells (glutathione instability), so nitrofurantoin must not be used because it can cause haemolytic anaemia. For the same reason, nitrofurantoin should not be given to pregnant women after 38 weeks of pregnancy. Nitrofurantoin is contraindicated in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD) because of risk of intravascular hemolysis resulting in anemia. Pharmacology Organisms are said to be susceptible to nitrofurantoin if their minimum inhibitory concentration is 32 Œºg/ml or less. The peak blood concentration of nitrofurantoin following an oral dose of nitrofurantoin 100 mg is less than 1 Œºg/ml and may be undetectable. Its bioavailability is about 90% and the urinary excretion is 40%Antibiot. Chemother. 1978, 25, 233‚Äì252 tissue penetration is negligible; the drug is well concentrated in the urine: 75% of the dose is rapidly metabolised by the liver, but 25% of the dose is excreted in the urine unchanged, reliably achieving levels of 200 Œºg/ml or more. In studies of dogs, the majority of urinary excretion is through glomerular filtration with some tubular secretion. There is also tubular absorption which is increased with urine acidification. However the activity of nitrofurantoin is also pH dependent and mean inhibitory concentration rises sharply with increased pH above 6. Nitrofurantoin cannot be used to treat infections other than simple cystitis. At the concentrations achieved in urine (>100 Œºg/ml), nitrofurantoin is a bactericide. It is bacteriostatic against most susceptible organisms at concentrations less than 32 Œºg/ml. Nitrofurantoin and the quinolone antibiotics are mutually antagonistic in vitro. It is not known whether this is of clinical significance, but the combination should be avoided. Resistance to nitrofurantoin may be chromosomal or plasmid-mediated and involves inhibition of nitrofuran reductase. Acquired resistance in E. coli continues to be rare. Nitrofurantoin and its metabolites are excreted mainly by the kidneys. In renal impairment, the concentration achieved in urine may be subtherapeutic. Nitrofurantoin should not be used in patients with a creatinine clearance of 60 ml/min or less. However, a retrospective chart review may suggest nitrofurantoin is not contraindicated in this population. Formulations There are two formulations of nitrofurantoin. *Macrocrystals - (Macrodantin, Furadantin) - 25, 50, or 100 mg capsules - taken once every 6 hours *Monohydrate/macrocrystals - (Macrobid) - 100 mg capsules - taken once every 12 hours or 2 times a day (written on prescriptions as BID, which is the last part of the trade name MacroBID). It is 75% monohydrate and 25% macrocrystals. Mechanism of action Nitrofurantoin is concentrated in the urine, leading to higher and more effective levels in the urinary tract than in other tissues or compartments. With a 100 mg oral dose, plasma levels are typically less than 1 ¬µg/ml while in the urine it reaches 200 ¬µg/ml. The drug works by damaging bacterial DNA, since its reduced form is highly reactive. This is made possible by the rapid reduction of nitrofurantoin inside the bacterial cell by flavoproteins (nitrofuran reductase) to multiple reactive intermediates that attack ribosomal proteins, DNA, respiration, pyruvate metabolism and other macromolecules within the cell. Nitrofurantoin exerts greater effects on bacterial cells than mammalian cells because bacterial cells activate the drug more rapidly. It is not known which of the actions of nitrofurantoin is primarily responsible for its bactericidal activity. The broad mechanism of action for this drug likely is responsible for the low development of resistance to its effects, as the drug affects many different processes important to the bacterial cell. History Nitrofurantoin has been available for the treatment of lower urinary tract infections (UTIs) since 1953. Animal feed Residues from the breakdown of nitrofuran veterinary antibiotics, including nitrofurantoin, have been found in chicken in Vietnam, China, Brazil, and Thailand.FAO: Nitrofuran study The European Union banned the use of nitrofurans in food producing animals by classifying it in ANNEX IV (list of pharmacologically active substances for which no maximum residue limits can be fixed) of the Council Regulation 2377/90. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States has prohibited furaltadone since February 1985 and withdrew the approval for the other nitrofuran drugs (except some topical uses) in January 1992. The topical use of furazolidone and nitrofurazone was prohibited in 2002. Australia prohibited the use of nitrofurans in food production in 1992. Japan did not allocate MRLs for nitrofurans leading to the implementation of a \\"zero tolerance or no residue standard\\". In Thailand, the Ministry of Health issued in 2001 Proclamation No. 231 MRL of veterinary drug in food which did not allocate MRL for nitrofurans. The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives had already prohibited importation and use of furazolidone and nitrofurazone in animal feed in 1999 which was extended to all nitrofurans in 2002. Several metabolites of nitrofurans, such as furazolidone, furaltadone and nitrofurazone cause cancer or genetic damage in rats. Society and culture It is available as a generic medication. The cost of the liquid formulation of nitrofurantoin in the U.S. became controversial after a 400% price increase. There are two manufacturers of the liquid formulation in the U.S., Casper Pharma and Nostrum Laboratories. In 2018, Casper increased their price to $2,800. In response to Casper, Nostrum increased their price from $474.75 to $2,392. In the U.K., a slightly larger bottle costs ¬£446.95. In an interview with the Financial Times, Nirmal Mulye, Nostrum chief executive, said that there was a \\"moral requirement to sell the product at the highest price.\\" He defended Martin Shkreli, and said, \\"This is a capitalist economy and if you can‚Äôt make money you can‚Äôt stay in business.\\" Mulye also attacked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as \\"incompetent and corrupt.\\" There is a shortage of liquid nitrofurantoin, because the FDA implemented new rules on impurities, he said. Mulye dismissed the new rules on impurities as a \\"piece of nonsense.\\"Pharma chief defends 400% drug price rise as a ‚Äòmoral requirement‚Äô, David Crow, Financial Times, Sept. 11, 2018 FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb tweeted a response: \\"[T]here‚Äôs no moral imperative to price gouge and take advantage of patients.

Her adoptive brother was Michael Reagan and her half-siblings were Patti Davis and Ron Reagan, from her father's second marriage (to Nancy Reagan). Biography Maureen Reagan with her mother, Jane Wyman (1944) Early life Reagan was born January 4, 1941, in Los Angeles, where she was raised. She graduated from Marymount Secondary School, Tarrytown, New York in 1958 and briefly attended Marymount University in Virginia. She worked for Walker & Dunlop and entered the Miss Washington competition in 1959. Her parents also had another daughter, Christine, who died shortly after birth. Acting career Reagan pursued a career in acting in her youth, appearing in films such as Kissin' Cousins (1964) in which she featured alongside Elvis Presley. Political activities Reagan spoke on behalf of Republican candidates throughout the country, including twenty appearances alone in 1967 for unsuccessful Mississippi gubernatorial nominee, Rubel Phillips, a former segregationist who ran that year on a platform of racial moderation. Reagan was the first son or daughter of a President to be elected cochair of the Republican National Committee. However, both of her attempts at election to political office ended in defeat. She ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate from California in 1982 (which was eventually won by Pete Wilson) and in 1992 for California's 36th congressional district. Although they maintained a united front, Maureen Reagan differed from her father on several key issues. Although reared Roman Catholic following her mother's conversion, she was pro-choice on abortion. She also held the belief that Oliver North should have been court-martialed. After her father announced his diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in 1994, Maureen Reagan became a member of the Alzheimer's Association board of directors and served as the group's spokeswoman. While hospitalized for melanoma cancer towards the end of her life, Maureen was only floors away from her father who had suffered a severe fall. Personal life In 1960, Maureen's by-then divorced parents became concerned about her. Ronald Reagan used his connections at the FBI ‚àí established during his work as an anti-communist informant ‚àí to request the agency to investigate her romantic life. The agency did so on condition that the FBI not be cited as a source, and reported that she was living with an older, married man who was a police officer. Maureen Reagan was married three times: *John Filippone, a policeman; they were married in 1961 and divorced the following year. *David G. Sills, a lawyer and Marine Corps officer; they married on February 28, 1964; the couple divorced in 1967. *Dennis C. Revell, CEO of Revell Communications (a national public relations/public affairs firm), whom she married on April 25, 1981. She and Revell had one daughter, Margaret \\"Rita\\" Mirembe Revell, who was born in Uganda. The Revells became Rita's guardians in 1994. They adopted her in 2001. Rita was the beneficiary of a private bill to facilitate her adoption as Maureen and Dennis Revell were unable to complete the necessary paperwork and other requirements by the Ugandan government, including a personal visitation to that country, due, in large part, to Maureen Reagan Revell's terminal cancer. Death Reagan died in Granite Bay, California, on August 8, 2001, aged 60, from melanoma. She is interred at Calvary Catholic Cemetery and Mausoleum in Sacramento, California. Reagan volunteered with actor David Hyde Pierce, of TV's Frasier, at the Alzheimer's Association. At her funeral on August 19, 2001, Pierce spoke to the gathering at Cathedral of Blessed Sacrament in Sacramento, and recalled his friend's tireless devotion to fighting the mind-robbing illness. \\"When she was given lemons, she did not make lemonade.

Like Bimota, the name is a portmanteau derived loosely from the names of its designers Meixner, Cockerell, and Landgraf. Design The Megola had a unique design, laid down by Fritz Cockerell in 1920, using a rotary engine mounted within the front wheel. The engine contained five cylinders with side-mounted valves, each of which displaced , with a bore/stroke of and a total displacement of . The cylinders rotated around the front axle at six times the wheel speed; thus while the cylinders were at maximum of 3600 rpm the front wheel was turning at 600 rpm, or roughly (given the wheel diameter). A hand- controlled butterfly valve was located in the hollow crankshaft to regulate throttle. Power output was a modest but was applied directly to the wheel. This arrangement produced a very low centre of gravity and provided for excellent handling.Title: \\"The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Motorcycles\\", Editor: Erwin Tragatsch, Published: New Burlington Books, 1979. The first prototype was built in 1920 with the five cylinders mounted within the rear wheel. Unusual features on the production models included two fuel tanks. The main tank was hidden under the extensive bodywork, and the fuel from it was taken to a much smaller tank above the engine via a hand pump. Two independent brakes were used for the rear wheel. Megolas came well-equipped, with a fuel gauge, tachometer and ammeter as standard equipment. They were available in two variants: sporting and touring. the touring version featured a sprung rear wheel and soft saddle; the sport was without rear suspension but with a more powerful engine. The top speed was . The motorcycle racer Toni Bauhofer achieved on a sports-model on the AVUS racing circuit in Berlin. In 1924, he won the over-500cc-class on a Megola at the German Motorcycle Road Championship. A Megola touring bike displayed at a 2011 exhibition in Paris - 110 ans d'automobile au Grand Palais The engine was very flexible, lacking both a clutch and a transmission. To start the engine, the rider had to either spin the front wheel while the cycle was on its stand, or push-start the cycle. The cylinders could be disassembled without having to remove all the wheel spokes in order to service the engine. However, the lack of a clutch meant the engine had to be stopped when the cycle was stationary. As an alternative, the owner's manual suggested the rider make small orbits in the road if at any point they had to halt. The tires were tubed with the front inner-tube being a circular sausage-shape rather than a complete doughnut-like torus shape, so that it could be changed without removing the wheel and engine. At the time, this type of tube was produced commercially so it was likely not created specially for the Magola. The box-section frame contained the main fuel tank which fed by gravity a smaller tank mounted on the axle. The front suspension consisted of semi-elliptical springs. Legacy During less than five years of production, approximately 2000 machines were built and sold. Around 15 examples remain; one was displayed at the Guggenheim Museum 'Art of the Motorcycle' exhibition in New York City. An example of a sport version of the Megola is part of the automotive collection of Jay Leno.Around eight replica Megolas have been built between the 1980's and the present day. A replica, fitted with an original engine, was sold by Bonhams auction house in London in 2016 for ¬£ 82,140. Killinger and Freund In 1935, there was an attempt by a group of engineers to make an improved version, the Killinger and Freund Motorcycle, but World War II put an end to their plans.

Irish Independent. 11 September 2005.Creggan Camogie Club ( or ; )Placenames Database of Ireland is a large village and civil parish in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, four miles from Ballymena. It is located in the Mid and East Antrim Borough Council area. It had a population of 3,417 people at the 2011 Census. In early documents, Ahoghill is referred to as Magherahoghill meaning \\"the plain of the yew forest.\\"  Demography  Ahoghill had a population of 3,417 people (1,327 households) at the 2011 Census, an increase of 11.8% on the 2001 Census population of 3,055.

Thousands of ordinary folk had their lives changed at this time. Especially notable is the reports of men and women weeping in the streets of Ahoghill. On Monday 14 March 1859 a thanksgiving service took place in the new First Ahoghill Presbyterian Meetinghouse at which some of the converts from Connor spoke. It was estimated that 3,000 people attended and the commotion was such that the minister ordered the building to be emptied out of fear of the crowded gallery giving way. The crowd spent upwards of three hours in the rain continuing in prayer and praise.

The practice is most common in North America, where a league franchise system is used and the teams are overwhelmingly privately owned. Owners who move a team generally do so seeking better profits, facilities, fan support, or a combination of these. North America Unlike most professional sport systems worldwide, North America does not have comprehensive governing bodies whose authority extends from the amateur to the highest levels of a given sport. North American sports generally do not operate a system of promotion and relegation in which poorly performing teams are replaced with teams that do well in lower-level leagues. A city wishing to get a team in a major professional sports league can wait for the league to expand and award new franchises. However, such expansions are infrequent, and generally limited to a narrow window in time. Many current owners believe 32 is the optimal size for a major league due to playoff structure and ease of scheduling. As of 2018, each of the major leagues has between 30 and 32 franchises. The National Hockey League (NHL) has expanded to 32 teams, with the Vegas Golden Knights having become the league's 31st team in 2017 and the Seattle Kraken due to become the 32nd team in 2021. In past decades, aspiring owners whose overtures had been rejected by the established leagues would respond by forming a rival league in hopes that the existing major league would eventually agree to a merger; the new league would attain major league status in its own right; and/or the established league was compelled to expand. The 1960s American Football League (AFL) is perhaps the most recent example of a successful rival league, having achieved each of the three goals listed above in reverse order. However, all major sports have had a rival league achieve at least some of these goals in the last half of the 20th century. Baseball's proposed Continental League did not play a game but only because Major League Baseball responded to the proposal by adding teams in some of the new league's proposed cities. The American Basketball Association (ABA) and World Hockey Association (WHA) each succeeded in getting some of their franchises accepted into the established leagues, which had both unsuccessfully attempted to cause their upstart rivals to fold outright by adding more teams. However, the upstart leagues owed their success in large part to the reluctance of owners in the established leagues to devote the majority of their revenues to player salaries and also to sports leagues' former reliance primarily on gate receipts for revenue. Under those conditions, an ambitious rival could often afford to lure away the sport's top players with promises of better pay, in hopes of giving the new league immediate respect and credibility from fans. Today, however, established leagues derive a large portion of their revenue from lucrative television contracts that would not be offered to an untested rival. Also, the activism of players' unions has resulted in the established leagues paying a majority of their revenues to players, thus the average salary in each of the big four leagues is now well in excess of $1 million per season. Under present market and financial conditions, any serious attempt to form a rival league in the early 21st century would likely require hundreds of millions (if not billions) of dollars in investment and initial losses, and even if such resources were made available the upstart league's success would be far from guaranteed, as evidenced by the failure of the WWF/NBC-backed XFL in 2001 and the UFL from 2009 to 2012. The current major leagues have established lucrative relationships with all of the major media outlets in the United States, who subsidize the league's operations because their established fame ensures strong ratings; the networks are far less willing to provide such coverage to an unproven upstart league, often requiring the upstart league to pay the network in order for those leagues to be covered. Therefore, as long as leagues choose not to expand and/or reject a city's application, the only realistic recourse is to convince the owner(s) of an existing team to move it (or convince a prospective owner to purchase a team with the intent of moving it). Owners usually move teams because of weak fan support or because the team organization is in debt and needs an adequate population for financial support or because another city offers a bigger local market or a more financially lucrative stadium/arena deal. Governments may offer lucrative deals to team owners to attract or retain a team. For example, to attract the NFL's Cleveland Browns in 1995, the state of Maryland agreed to build a new stadium in Baltimore and allow the team to use it rent-free and keep all parking, advertising and concession revenue. (This move proved so unpopular in Cleveland that the move was treated as the Baltimore Ravens being awarded an expansion franchise, and the Browns name and their official lineage would remain in Cleveland for a \\"reactivated\\" team that rejoined the NFL three years later.) A little more than a decade earlier, the Baltimore Colts left for Indianapolis (NFL owners voted to give Colts owner Robert Irsay permission to move his franchise to the city of his choosing after no satisfactory stadium would be built). Moving sports teams is often controversial. Opponents criticize owners for leaving behind faithful fans and governments for spending millions of dollars of tax money on attracting teams. However, since sports teams in the United States are generally treated like any other business under antitrust law, there is little sports leagues can do to prevent teams from flocking to the highest bidders (for instance, the Los Angeles Rams filed suit when the other NFL owners initially blocked their move to St. Louis, which caused the NFL to back down and allow the move to proceed). Major League Baseball, unique among the major professional sports leagues, has an exemption from antitrust laws won by a Supreme Court decision but nonetheless has allowed several teams to change cities. Also recently, courts denied the attempted move of the team then known as the Phoenix Coyotes by siding with the NHL, which claimed that it had final authority over franchise moves. Newer sports leagues tend to have more transient franchises than more established, \\"major\\" leagues, but in the mid-1990s, several NFL and NHL teams moved to other cities, and the threat of a move pushed cities with major-league teams in any sport to build new stadiums and arenas using taxpayer money. The trend continued in the 2000s, when three National Basketball Association (NBA) teams moved in a seven-year span after there were no moves at all in the 16 years before it. Critics referred to the movement of teams to the highest-bidding city as \\"franchise free agency.\\"  United States and Canada  The following charts list movements of franchises in the modern eras of the major North American sports leagues. It does not include: *Moves within a city, which have occurred many times in all major leagues. *Short distance moves from one city in a metro area to another city in the same metro area. (For example, San Francisco to Oakland or vice versa.) *Short-distance city-suburb moves. (For example, Los Angeles to Anaheim, both of which are in the same urban agglomeration.) *Team moves that happened before the organization joined its current league. ** Note, however, that the NFL considers the American Football League of the 1960s as an integral part of its own history. Therefore, moves of AFL teams during the existence of that league are included. *Moves of teams that, as of 2020, no longer exist. There were many such moves in the early years of the NFL in particular. *Teams that have threatened to move as leverage for a new stadium or arena in their current market without actually moving, as well as teams that nearly moved for other reasons, not related to team dissatisfaction in a given market. (For example, the Pittsburgh Pirates nearly moving to Denver following the Pittsburgh drug trials in 1985, the Minnesota Timberwolves almost moving to New Orleans in 1994, or the Sacramento Kings almost moving to Anaheim, Seattle, and Virginia Beach from 2011 to 2013.) =Major League Baseball= *1902: Original Milwaukee Brewers moved to St. Louis and became the St. Louis Browns. *1903: Original Baltimore Orioles moved to New York City and became the Highlanders. The team was renamed the Yankees in . As this situation may be considered a case of the American League dissolving the Baltimore franchise and issuing a new franchise in New York, Yankees history information usually begins in 1903. *1953: Boston Braves moved to Milwaukee. This was the first move in 50 years. During those 50 years, there had also been no expansions or contractions ‚Äì Major League Baseball had consisted of the same 16 teams, 8 in each league, playing in the same 10 cities without interruption for half a century. *1954: St. Louis Browns moved to Baltimore and became the Orioles. *1955: Philadelphia Athletics moved to Kansas City. *1958: Brooklyn Dodgers moved to Los Angeles and the New York Giants moved to San Francisco. These were the first major league teams to be based in the U.S. West Coast; the teams moved simultaneously to facilitate travel for other National League (NL) teams. The NL granted New York City a new expansion franchise, the New York Mets, in . *1961: Washington Senators moved to the Twin Cities area and became the Minnesota Twins. Not wishing to alienate Washington, D.C., the American League (AL) granted the city a new expansion franchise, also called the Senators. *1966: Milwaukee Braves moved to Atlanta. *1968: Kansas City Athletics moved to Oakland. Because Charles O. Finley broke a recently signed lease and public bonds were already issued for the building of what is now known as Kauffman Stadium, Major League Baseball was in danger of anti-trust legislation from Stuart Symington, U.S. Senator from Missouri. As a result, the AL granted Kansas City a new expansion franchise, the Kansas City Royals, in . *1970: Seattle Pilots moved to Milwaukee and became the Brewers. The AL granted Seattle a new expansion franchise, the Seattle Mariners, in . *1972: Washington Senators moved to Arlington and became the Texas Rangers. *2005: Montreal Expos moved to Washington, D.C. and became the Washington Nationals. The Expos had split time between Montreal and San Juan, Puerto Rico in 2003 and 2004. This was the first move in 33 years. *2020: Toronto Blue Jays temporarily moved to Buffalo, New York and retained the name. This is due to the COVID-19 pandemic affecting Canada which resulted the closure of the Canada-United States border, preventing the Blue Jays from playing its home games at the Rogers Centre. It also marked the first time an MLB game was played in Buffalo since the Buffalo Bisons of the Federal League folded in 1915 as well as no games played in Canada since 1968. =National Basketball Association= *1951: Tri-Cities Blackhawks, who played their home games in Moline and Rock Island and Davenport, moved to Milwaukee and became the Hawks. *1955: Milwaukee Hawks moved to St. Louis. *1957: Fort Wayne Pistons moved to Detroit. *1957: Rochester Royals moved to Cincinnati. *1960: Minneapolis Lakers moved to Los Angeles. *1962: Philadelphia Warriors moved to the San Francisco Bay Area and became the San Francisco Warriors, then the Golden State Warriors in 1971. *1963: Chicago Zephyrs moved to Baltimore and became the Baltimore Bullets. *1963: Syracuse Nationals moved to Philadelphia and became the 76ers. *1968: St. Louis Hawks moved to Atlanta and became the Atlanta Hawks. *1971: San Diego Rockets moved to Houston and became the Houston Rockets. *1972: Cincinnati Royals moved to a new primary home in Kansas City and a secondary home in Omaha, becoming the Kansas City-Omaha Kings (to avoid confusion with the baseball Royals.) The team ceased playing home games in Omaha in 1975. *1973: Baltimore Bullets moved to Landover, Maryland, outside Washington, D.C., and were renamed as the Capital Bullets. The team was renamed the Washington Bullets in ; in conjunction with the opening of their new arena in downtown D.C., the team was renamed the Washington Wizards in . *1978: Buffalo Braves moved to San Diego and became the Clippers. *1979: New Orleans Jazz moved to Salt Lake City and become the Utah Jazz. *1984: San Diego Clippers moved to Los Angeles and became the Los Angeles Clippers. *1985: Kansas City Kings moved to Sacramento and became the Sacramento Kings. *2001: Vancouver Grizzlies moved to Memphis and became the Memphis Grizzlies. *2002: Charlotte Hornets moved to New Orleans. The NBA granted Charlotte a new expansion franchise, known as the Bobcats, in . The Bobcats reclaimed the Hornets name before the start of the . ** At the same time that the name change to Hornets was announced, it was also revealed that the Hornets, the league, and the franchise now known as the New Orleans Pelicans had reached an agreement that the history of the original Charlotte Hornets would belong exclusively to the current Hornets. As a result, the NBA now considers the Charlotte Hornets to have begun play in the , suspended operations following the , returned as the Bobcats beginning with the , and renamed the Hornets beginning with the 2014‚Äì15 season, while the New Orleans Pelicans kept their history as the Hornets from moving in . *2005: New Orleans Hornets moved temporarily to Oklahoma City following Hurricane Katrina and became the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets. *2007: New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets returned to New Orleans full-time. The team was renamed as the Pelicans in . *2008: Seattle SuperSonics moved to Oklahoma City and became the Thunder. =National Football League= The history of the NFL fully incorporates that of the fourth American Football League, which began operation in 1960 with eight teams and became by far the most successful rival to the NFL. In 1966, the two leagues agreed to a merger that took full effect in 1970. All teams from the 1960‚Äì1969 AFL were brought intact to the NFL, and the current NFL recognizes all AFL records and statistics as its own. *1921: Decatur Staleys moved to Chicago and became the Bears one year later. *1934: Portsmouth Spartans moved to Detroit and became the Lions. *1937: Boston Redskins moved to Washington, D.C. *1946: Cleveland Rams moved to Los Angeles. *1960: Chicago Cardinals moved to St. Louis. *1961: The AFL's Los Angeles Chargers moved to San Diego after spending only their inaugural season in Los Angeles. *1963: The AFL Dallas Texans (not to be confused with the short-lived NFL franchise of the same name) moved to Kansas City, Missouri, and became the Kansas City Chiefs. *1982: Oakland Raiders moved to Los Angeles. Although the NFL refused permission for the move, the team won the right to move (as well as the right to remain as a franchise in its conference and in the league) through a court case. *1984: Baltimore Colts moved to Indianapolis and became the Indianapolis Colts. The team's offices were slipped out of Baltimore in the middle of the night to avoid a proposed eminent domain seizure by the state of Maryland. *1988: St. Louis Cardinals moved to the Phoenix area, playing games in nearby Tempe and became the Phoenix Cardinals. The team was renamed the Arizona Cardinals in . The team now plays in another Phoenix suburb, Glendale. *1995: Los Angeles Raiders moved back to Oakland after 13 seasons. *1995: Los Angeles Rams moved to St. Louis. *1996: Cleveland Browns players and coaching staff moved to Baltimore and became the Ravens. The move was one of the most controversial in major professional sports history. In response to a fan revolt and legal threats, the NFL awarded a new franchise to Cleveland in , which for historical purposes is considered a continuation of the original Browns franchise. *1997: Houston Oilers moved to Memphis and became the Tennessee Oilers. The team originally planned to play the 1997 and 1998 seasons in Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium in Memphis before moving to Nashville. However, due to poor attendance, the team moved to Nashville in 1998, playing in Vanderbilt University's stadium. The team was renamed the Titans in 1999, when their new stadium was opened. The NFL granted Houston a new expansion franchise in . *2016: St. Louis Rams moved back to Los Angeles after 21 seasons in St. Louis. The team is to move to a new stadium in nearby Inglewood in 2020. *2017: San Diego Chargers returned to their original home of Los Angeles after 56 seasons in San Diego. The team played in the suburb of Carson before joining the Rams at their new stadium in 2020. *2020: Oakland Raiders were approved to move to a new stadium in the Las Vegas area in 2020. The team played in Oakland for the 2018 season and, due to being thwarted in its plans to play in San Francisco by their regional rivals the 49ers, were forced to play in Oakland in 2019 as well before completing the move to Las Vegas in 2020. =National Hockey League= Only one NHL team that moved has kept its name: the Calgary Flames. The Edmonton Oilers nearly moved to Houston in 1998, but the team remained in the city after a limited partnership raised enough money to purchase the franchise before the deadline. The then-Phoenix Coyotes were placed into bankruptcy with the intent to circumvent the league's relocation rules, but this was blocked by a judge. Other threats to leave came from two of the 1967 expansion teams, the Pittsburgh Penguins (on multiple occasions) and St. Louis Blues (in 1983), but ultimately stayed in their existing markets. *1976: California Golden Seals, who played their home games in Oakland, moved to Cleveland and became the Barons. The Cleveland Barons then merged with the Minnesota North Stars two years later; the San Francisco Bay Area was awarded the San Jose Sharks in 1991 when the owners threatened to move the team from Minnesota, they were allowed to split half the team back to San Jose. *1976: Kansas City Scouts moved to Denver and became the Colorado Rockies. *1978: The Cleveland Barons franchise merged with the Minnesota North Stars; Ohio was awarded an expansion team in . *1980: Atlanta Flames moved to Calgary; Atlanta was awarded an expansion team in , which moved to Winnipeg in . *1982: Colorado Rockies moved to East Rutherford and became the New Jersey Devils; 13 years later, Colorado received a relocated team. *1993: Minnesota North Stars moved to Dallas and became the Stars; Minnesota was awarded an expansion team in . *1995: Quebec Nordiques moved to Denver and became the Colorado Avalanche. *1996: Winnipeg Jets moved to Phoenix and became the Phoenix Coyotes. The team changed its geographic name to Arizona prior to the . *1997: Hartford Whalers moved to Raleigh and became the Carolina Hurricanes. For the and seasons, they played home games in Greensboro while their intended home, the venue now known as PNC Arena, was under construction in Raleigh. *2011: Atlanta Thrashers moved to Winnipeg and became the current version of the Winnipeg Jets. =Major League Soccer= *2006: The San Jose Earthquakes moved to Houston and became the Houston Dynamo; however, the team records, logo, colors, championships, and history were left in San Jose. An option for an MLS franchise was awarded to Oakland Athletics owner Lew Wolff in 2006, and the option was exercised in 2007. The Earthquakes resumed play in MLS in 2008 as a continuation of the previous Earthquakes franchise under new ownership. =Canadian Football League= While none of the CFL's core Canadian franchises have moved from one market to another, the league's short-lived expansion into the United States did include one team move. *1995: the Sacramento Gold Miners, the first CFL member in the United States, moved to San Antonio, Texas, to become the San Antonio Texans. The league also attempted to move the Las Vegas Posse after their single season of 1994. Prior to the 1995 season, multiple ownership groups unsuccessfully tried to buy the team for a move to Jackson, Mississippi. Following that, plans were made to move the team to Miami, Florida as the Manatees, but plans fell through when the league chose to end the US expansion before the Manatees' scheduled launch in 1996. The CFL's expansion into the US both began and ended with events that were not technically team moves, but were also not truly new teams being formed. The staff of the Ottawa Rough Riders moved from Ottawa to Shreveport, Louisiana, to become the Shreveport Pirates in 1993, but the CFL forced the team itself to be left in Ottawa, where a new owner kept the franchise alive. In 1996, the owners of the Baltimore Stallions folded the team upon the announcement that the Cleveland Browns would be moving to Baltimore (but see Cleveland Browns relocation controversy). Despite high attendance and success on the field, management felt that they would be unable to directly compete with an NFL team in the same city. The Stallions' ownership group took over the then-dormant Montreal Alouettes franchise. While the players were released from their contracts with the Stallions, many were subsequently signed to the Alouettes. The CFL and the Alouettes do not consider the Stallions' records, including the 1995 Grey Cup victory, as part of the team's legacy. The Alouettes are instead considered a continuation of the previous teams of that name. Australia and New Zealand The two major professional sporting leagues in Australia are the Australian Football League (AFL) and National Rugby League (NRL). Both competitions were originally based in one city (Melbourne and Sydney respectively) and expanded to a national level, and through that process, there have been team moves, mergers and closures in both leagues. The clubs are owned by members, not privately, but the North American franchise model exists, which means entry to the league is restricted. The hybrid model has meant that the leading promoter of moving is the league itself, trying to grow the football code by encouraging poorly performing clubs to move interstate. AFL The AFL is the national competition in Australian rules football and grew out of the mostly suburban Melbourne based Victorian Football League competition; as a result, the member clubs have had to move to adjust to a changing national focus. =Major interstate moves and mergers= *South Melbourne Football Club: In 1982, it moved interstate to Sydney, 963 km north and became the Sydney Swans. Despite early struggles, the club has more than tripled its membership since, and has won premierships (championships) in 2005 and 2012. *Fitzroy Football Club: In 1996, the Melbourne-based club merged its playing operations with the interstate Brisbane Bears, a club 1669 km north of its original home, with the Bears becoming the Brisbane Lions. Since the merger, the Brisbane club almost doubled its membership and won three consecutive premierships between 2001 and 2003. The Fitzroy Football Club ceased fielding a team in professional competitions, but it continues as a standalone entity based at its traditional home, and has fielded a team in the amateur Victorian Amateur Football Association (VAFA) since 2009. =Suburban based club joins the National competition= *The Port Adelaide Football Club, established in 1870, participated in the SANFL competition until 1997 when the club joined the AFL. In 1997 the Port Adelaide Magpies Football Club was formed to maintain the clubs presence in the SANFL at the request of the SANFL winning premierships in 1998 and 1999. The Port Adelaide Football Club won the 2004 AFL Premiership and maintains strong links to its community in the Port Adelaide area. It is the only suburban club to join the national AFL competition with all other additions to the expanded VFL being composite sides or newly established clubs like the Sydney Swans, the Brisbane Bears ( see above ), West Coast, Adelaide, Fremantle, Gold Coast and Greater Western Sydney. =Minor moves= *St Kilda Football Club: In 1964, the team moved from the Junction Oval in St Kilda to the Moorabbin Oval in the South Eastern Melbourne suburb of Moorabbin. Two years, later they won their first and only premiership. From 1993 to 1999, they played their home games to Waverley Park in Mulgrave in Melbourne's east. St Kilda were one of the first tenants of the new Colonial Stadium in 2000, but their administration remained at Moorabbin. In late 2007, it was confirmed that the club would leave Moorabbin to set up base in Seaford, Victoria, a region (the Mornington Peninsula) where the club added many supporters. The move was completed at the start of the 2011 season. The Saints moved their training and administration back to Moorabbin Oval in 2018. *Hawthorn Football Club ‚Äì in 1973, it moved from suburban Hawthorn to Princes Park in Carlton, an inner Northern suburb of Melbourne, and then to Waverley Park in 1991. In 2000, the club moved its home games to the Melbourne Cricket Ground. In 2005, some years after Waverley Park's demise as an official VFL/AFL venue, the club permanently moved to Waverley, but the name of the club did not change. The Hawks bought a plot of land in the locality of Dingley and plan to move their base to there in 2020/21. *Brisbane Bears ‚Äì in 1993 moved to the Brisbane Cricket Ground in Brisbane for the 1993 season and membership and attendances instantly tripled. Formed in 1986, the perhaps- incorrectly named side had initially established itself in Carrara, Queensland, a suburb of the city of Gold Coast, Queensland, some 80 km south of the city of Brisbane. *Collingwood Football Club ‚Äì in 1999, it played their last game at Victoria Park in Collingwood and moved to the larger and more central Melbourne Cricket Ground. The headquarters of the club moved to the Lexus Centre in Richmond, Victoria in 2005. =Home ground-only moves= *Fitzroy Football Club: In 1967, the team moved its home ground from the Brunswick Street Oval in Fitzroy to Princes Park, Carlton. In 1970, the club again moved its home game to the Junction Oval in 1970, then the Whitten Oval in 1984 before eventually merging with an interstate club. *Essendon Football Club ‚Äì in 1993 moved their home ground from Windy Hill, Essendon to the larger and more central Melbourne Cricket Ground. In 2000, the club again moved home games to the Telstra Dome, though the headquarters of the club remained in Essendon. In 2013 the Bombers moved their training and administration to Tullamarine. *Port Adelaide Football Club ‚Äì in 1997, on admission to the AFL moved its home games to AAMI Stadium. The club retained its administration and training base at Alberton Oval in Port Adelaide. *North Melbourne Football Club ‚Äì in 2000 moved home ground to the Telstra Dome, but retained the Arden Street Oval in North Melbourne as official headquarters. *Geelong Football Club ‚Äì in 2000, the provincial Victorian club became the AFL's first true dual-home club, playing the larger games at the Telstra Dome 75 kilometres away in Melbourne. The club's administration remains based at Kardinia Park in Geelong. *Footscray Football Club ‚Äì in 2002 moved permanently from the Whitten Oval in Footscray to the larger and more central Telstra Dome and changed their name to the Western Bulldogs, though the club's headquarters is still in Footscray. *Richmond Football Club ‚Äì moved their home games from Punt Road Oval next door to the much larger Melbourne Cricket Ground. The club still trains and has administration quarters at the Punt Road Oval. *Melbourne Football Club ‚Äì During the re-development of their home, the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the training and administration headquarters of the club were temporarily moved to Sandringham, Victoria with the Victorian Football League affiliate, the Sandringham Football Club. The club's training headquarters are currently at the Junction Oval which proves troublesome during the summer as it is used for cricket. The club hopes to remove the problems associated with separate administration and training headquarters when it moves all operation to its new headquarters at a refurbished Olympic Park Stadium in 2007. *Carlton Football Club ‚Äì at the end of the 2005 season moved from Optus Oval in Carlton, to the larger and more central Telstra Dome, although retained its administration headquarters at Princes Park. The club was the last suburban based Melbourne club to leave its former home ground. =Secondary interstate 'homes'= Some Melbourne-based clubs began selling home games interstate in the late 1990s and conducting community camp clinics to build up local supporter bases. *Western Bulldogs ‚Äì Darwin, Northern Territory since 2000 (approximately 1-2 games a year). In 2007, the Bulldogs reduced their commitment to 1 game and signed a deal to also play 1 game a year in Canberra. They suspended their operations in Canberra in 2010, and stopped playing games in Darwin in 2013. They played 1 match a year in Cairns against the Gold Coast Suns from 2014 to 2018, and now play 1 game per year in Ballarat *St Kilda Football Club ‚Äì Launceston, Tasmania (approximately 2 games a year between 2002‚Äì2010). *Hawthorn Football Club ‚Äì Launceston, Tasmania (approximately 2 games a year between 2011‚Äì2015). In 2015 they increased the number of games to 4 per year. *North Melbourne Football Club ‚Äì in 1999, backed by the AFL, the club changed their trading name to the Kangaroos, and played a handful of home games interstate in Sydney. The move proved unsuccessful, and the club has since played in Canberra for several years (2002‚Äì2006) before abandoning the area for the more lucrative, and potential goldmine at the Gold Coast, Queensland (2007‚Äì2008). However, the club pulled out from moving 'home' games altogether after declining a league offer of a full move to the Gold Coast. The club then started playing 2 games a year in Hobart in 2013 and now play 4 games per year at Hobart‚Äòs Blundstone Arena as of 2017 *Melbourne Football Club ‚Äì a single home game a year to the Brisbane Lions at the Brisbane Cricket Ground in Queensland (2005‚Äì2007). The Demons added a single game to Gold Coast, Queensland in Queensland in 2006. In 2007, the Demons shifted its Gold Coast commitment to Canberra for a single game each year whilst also playing one game a year in Brisbane. The Demons abandoned operations in Canberra and the Gold Coast in 2011 after the addition of the Gold Coast Suns as a new AFL franchise, in 2014 the club started playing 1 game a year in Darwin and 1 game a year in Alice Springs A-League New Zealand Knights FC, who played in Auckland, New Zealand, were dissolved and moved to Wellington in 2004, becoming Wellington Phoenix FC. During the later stages of the 2006‚Äì07 A-League season, Football Federation Australia (FFA) removed New Zealand Knights A-League licence due to the club's financial and administrative problems and poor on-field performance. After much delay, the final amount needed for the application came from Wellington property businessman Terry Serepisos in the latter stages of the bid. Serepisos, the club's majority owner and chairman, provided NZD $1,000,000 to ensure the beginnings of a new New Zealand franchise and a continuation of New Zealand's participation in the A-League. FFA finalised a three-year A-League licence to New Zealand Football who then sub-let the licence to the Wellington-based club. The new Wellington club was confirmed on 19 March 2007. The name for the new club was picked from a shortlist of six, pruned from 250 names suggested by the public, and was announced on 28 March 2007. Serepisos said of the name, that \\"It symbolises the fresh start, the rising from the ashes, and the incredible Wellington support that has come out\\".Wellington Phoenix rises from the ashes, Fox Sports (Australia), 28 March 2007 NRL The NRL is the national competition in rugby league and was born out of the Sydney-based Australian Rugby League and New South Wales Rugby League competitions. In 1987, the Western Suburbs Magpies agreed to move from its (inner) Western suburbs base to the outer south-western Macarthur district following a prior move west to Lidcombe Oval. In 1999, they merged with the remaining Inner Western team, the Balmain Tigers, (both teams having been established in 1908) to become Wests Tigers. The North Sydney Bears attempted to move from their Northern Suburbs base to the swiftly growing Central Coast region just north of Sydney in 1999, however problems with construction at the proposed home ground now known as Bluetongue Central Coast Stadium meant that the Bears continued to play home matches in a variety of Sydney grounds before being forced into a merger with the Manly Sea Eagles as the Northern Eagles. The merged clubs played home matches at both the Central Coast and Manly's home ground of Brookvale Oval, but after the bears were expelled from the partnership, poor crowds at the former location led to a reversion to the name of Manly and games played exclusively at Brookvale Oval. Subsequently, one of the owners of Bluetongue Central Coast Stadium, John Singleton, has attempted to lure another club to play there, notably the South Sydney Rabbitohs who have experienced poor crowds at their new home ground of ANZ Stadium. The Canterbury Bulldogs were formed in 1935 and played their first season without a home ground. In 1936, they settled at Belmore Oval (renamed the Belmore Sports Ground) and played home matches there until the end of the 1998 season. The Bulldogs trialled a number of alternative home grounds during the 1990s, including Concord Oval in 1994. In 1995, they changed their name to the Sydney Bulldogs and played most of the Premiership winning season at Parramatta Stadium, sharing the ground with bitter rivals, the Parramatta Eels and the also moved-and-renamed Sydney (Balmain) Tigers. They finally settled on Stadium Australia, the main stadium for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games as their home ground, and in 2008, moved their training and administration facilities from Belmore to the Homebush Olympic Park Site, though have since re-embraced the Belmore region by returning to the name of the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs and playing some of their home games at the new Belmore Sports Ground. Other clubs have moved to new home grounds but have retained their original base. Europe In Europe, moves are very rare because of the different relationship between clubs and their league in the European system of professional sports league organization. The practice is considered anathema. In most European sports, teams can be relegated from their current league to a lower one or promoted to the one above. Armenia *FC Banants were founded in 1992 in the village of Kotayk, representing the Kotayk Province. Between 1992 and 1995, the club was commonly referred to as Banants Kotayk.History of Football Club Banants, from fcbanants.com, retrieved 1 May 2009. During the 1992 season, the club won the first Armenian Cup. At the end of the 1995 transitional season, Banants suffered a financial crisis. The club owners decided that it was better to merge the club with FC Kotayk of Abovyan, rather than disband it. In 2001, Banants demerged from FC Kotayk, and was moved from Abovyan to the capital Yerevan. *FC Alashkert was founded in 1990 in the town of Martuni of Gegharkunik Province. In 1992, the team played in the Premier League representing Martuni and using the City Stadium of the town as their home venue. In 1999, they did not participate in the First League competition and later in early 2000, the club was dissolved. In February 2013, the club purchased the Nairi Stadium in Yerevan, to become the official venue of their home games. As a result, the club was officially moved from Martuni to Yerevan starting from the 2013‚Äì14 season. Austria *ASK√ñ Pasching in 2007 moved from Pasching to Klagenfurt and became SK Austria K√§rnten, effectively a new club to play in the Austrian Football Bundesliga.Endg√ºltig keine Lizenz f√ºr SK Austria K√§rnten > Kleine Zeitung In Pasching, FC Pasching was founded immediately after the move, while SK Austria in Klagenfurt took over the former name of rivalling FC K√§rnten as well as several notable players and sponsors' funds. In June 2010, SK Austria announced it was filing for bankruptcySK Austria K√§rnten hat Konkurs angemeldet ‚Äì oesterreich.ORF.at and the city of Klagenfurt founded a new club, SK Austria Klagenfurt (FC K√§rnten's historical name). Azerbaijan *Olimpik Baku was founded on the basis of a futsal team in 2004. In 2009, the club moved from central Baku to ≈û√ºv…ôlan and was renamed Olimpik-Shuvalan PFC.\\"Olimpik\\" club to be renamed –§–ö \\"–û–ª–∏–º–ø–∏–∫\\" –ø–µ—Ä–µ–∏–º–µ–Ω–æ–≤–∞–Ω The club once again was renamed in 2010, this time to AZAL PFC due to sponsorship reasons from the airline company Azerbaijan Airlines.\\"Olimpik-≈û√ºv…ôlan\\" adƒ±nƒ± d…ôyi≈üib, AZAL oldu –ê–ó–ê–õ –≤ –ø—Ä–µ–º—å–µ—Ä-–ª–∏–≥–µ In September 2010, the club management announced the construction of new AZAL Arena in ≈û√ºv…ôlan. *Qarabaƒü FK is a football club from Agdam, but has been based in Baku since 1993 due to the Nagorno-Karabakh war. *Shusha FK is a football club based in Baku but represents the city of Shusha, which is controlled by the self-declared Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. *Standard Sumgayit was founded in Baku as Standard Baku. The club moved to Sumgayit on 12 June 2009, which changed also club's name accordingly. Belgium *Football Couillet La Louvi√®re was formed in June 2009 as the result of a merger between R.A.C.S. Couillet and R.A.A. Louvi√©roise. The matricule of the club is the number 94 of RACS Couillet, so technically it is a continuation of Couillet, whereas La Louvi√®re has dissolved into Couillet, with their matricule (number 93) being lost. At the time of the merger, La Louvi√®re played in the third tier of Belgian football and Couillet in the fourth, as a result, the new team started in the fourth tier. After the merger, the team was based in La Louvi√®re and renamed to Football Club Couillet-La Louvi√®re with abbreviation FCLL. However, the team moved back to Couillet in Charleroi in 2011 after third division team URS Centre moved to the center of La Louvi√®re and changed its name to UR La Louvi√®re Centre. As a result, the team name was changed again to Football Club Charleroi. *RFC Li√®ge, after its home stadium the Stade V√©lodrome de Rocourt in Li√®ge was destroyed, the club became 'homeless'. After having played during 4 years at rue Gilles Magn√©e, in Ans where a temporary stand was built, the RFC Li√®ge is currently playing in Seraing at the Pairay Stadium. Cyprus At least three clubs were forced to move due to the 1974 Turkish invasion of that country: * Two clubs from Famagusta, Anorthosis (founded in 1911) and Nea Salamis (founded 1948), moved to Larnaca, and built new stadiums in that city. * Doxa Katokopia, founded in Katokopia in 1954, moved to Peristerona. The club later moved again to the country's capital of Nicosia. Czech Republic *Dukla Prague, a successful football team under the patronage of the Czech Armed Forces, originally from Prague, merged with second division side FC Port√°l P≈ô√≠bram in 1996.Pivoda 2013, p. 99. The new club, which later became known as 1. FK P≈ô√≠bram, played one season in Prague at the Juliska Stadium before moving to P≈ô√≠bram in 1997, the last home match at Juliska being a 2‚Äì2 draw with relegated Ban√≠k Hav√≠≈ôov on 1 June 1997,Pivoda 2013, p. 100. effectively meaning that the original FC P≈ô√≠bram, founded in 1929, moved to Prague, merged and then moved back. The club currently playing under the Dukla Prague name, and the current spiritual successor of the original team, FK Dukla Prague, was founded in 1958 as FK Dukla Dejvice and advanced to the Prague Championship in the 1983‚Äì84 season. Prior to 2001, the club's best finish in a season had been second in the Prague Championship in the 1984‚Äì85 season. In 2001, the club became known as FK Dukla Prague, but not the legal successor of the original Dukla Prague team. In November 2006, the new FK Dukla Prague management announced that it had agreed to a takeover of second league rights of the Jakubƒçovice team and in 2007 Dukla took Jakubƒçovice's place in the Czech 2. Liga, having finished the 2006‚Äì07 season in second place.Pivoda 2013, p. 128. *In ice hockey, the Kontinental Hockey League, based in Russia but also including teams from several other post- Soviet states, expanded outside the former Soviet Union for the first time in 2011, adding the Slovakian team Lev Poprad. The team was purchased by Czech interests after the 2011‚Äì12 season; the new owners folded the club and replaced it with a similarly named team, the Prague-based Lev Praha. Although the two Lev teams are technically separate corporate entities, this situation can effectively be viewed as a move; not only are the team names similar, but the new owners retained much of the Poprad roster. *Mountfield HK originated with a club that began playing ice hockey in ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice in 1928. Following the 2012‚Äì13 season, the Czech Extraliga reached a sponsorship deal with Radegast to sell its beer in all Extraliga arenas. This agreement conflicted with the naming rights deal HC ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice already had with Budweiser Budvar Brewery for their arena. Under the agreement, the club and the city would face stiff penalties for selling any beer other than Budvar products. Unable to resolve the dispute, the club decided on June 18, 2013 that no agreement could be reached between the parties involved and voted to immediately move to Hradec Kr√°lov√© for the 2013‚Äì14 season. The ice hockey traditions of HC ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice was continued in the town by a club which adopted the historical club name \\"Motor\\" - ƒåEZ Motor ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice Estonia *JK Tervis P√§rnu moved in 1996 and played its home games in Lelle, small borough in Kehtna Parish, becoming Lelle SK. At the end of 2002 the club moved back to P√§rnu and reinstated its original name. *KSK Vigri Tallinn moved from Tallinn to Maardu, becoming FK Maardu. *Lantana Tallinn moved in 1996 from the Kadriorg Stadium in Tallinn to the Viimsi Staadion in Viimsi. *Levadia Maardu was founded in 1998 in Maardu. In 2004, they moved to Tallinn, and were renamed to Levadia Tallinn. The original Levadia Tallinn founded in 2000 subsequently became the moved club's reserve team, Levadia II Tallinn. France In 1967, the top-tier but deep in-debt Toulouse FC, located in Toulouse, merged with Paris suburbs Red Star, then a tier-2 club, actually moving the entire club, including players and staff, North. This created a major scandal, leading to legislation changes, in particular the 1984 Avice law, which prevents out-of-departement fusions or moves for all sports *Athl√©tic Club Arles founded in 1913 in Arles, moved in 2010 to the nearby () Avignon and adopted its current name, Athl√©tic Club Arles-Avignon *Evian Thonon Gaillard F.C. were rumoured to be pursuing a move to play its home matches at the Stade de la Praille in Geneva, Switzerland after it was determined that the club's current facility, the Stade Joseph-Moynat, did not meet the Ligue de Football Professionnel's (LFP) standards. Thonon-les-Bains, the commune where the club situates itself, is a few kilometres from the Swiss border and is only , a 45-minute car drive, from the city of Geneva. It was reported that the club's president, Patrick Trotignon, had been in the process of advocating for the move since the beginning of the 2009‚Äì10 Championnat National season just in case the club had achieved promotion to the second division. The vice-president of Swiss club Servette FC, who occupy the stadium, questioned the move citing possible schedule conflicts, as well as the health of the pitch if both clubs were to use the stadium on a weekly basis. However, his claims were refuted by Beno√Æt Genecand, who serves as president of Fondation du Stade de Gen√®ve (FSG), which owns and operates the facility. The club responded immediately to Genecand's comments via a press release posted on the club's official website. Evian petitioned to the State Council of Geneva and obtained approval from the LFP for the move in early May. On 20 May 2010, Evian received a favourable ruling from the French Football Federation (FFF) with the Federal Council voting in favour of the move. According to the federation, the move now had to be agreed upon by a UEFA executive committee, which is composed of seventeen officials. On 8 June, UEFA officially denied Evian's request to play at the Stade de la Praille meaning the club would play its home matches at the Parc des Sports in nearby Annecy. Georgia Due to the Abkhaz‚ÄìGeorgian conflict several clubs from the region cannot compete in the Georgian league and therefore several clubs have been re-founded by internally displaced persons from Abkhazia in Tbilisi, and although the original clubs continue to exist in exile, and no actual move has occurred, the Abkhaz peoples who had founded these club consider the clubs to be the continuation of the original club: *Dinamo Sokhumi continues to exist however two phoenix clubs have been found. FC ASMC Sokhumi was first founded as Dinamo Sokhumi and continues to represent the city in Tbilisi. FC Tskhumi Sukhumi was formed to represent Sokhumi initially in 1990, due to FC Dinamo Sokhumi refusing to join Umaglesi Liga and played in the Soviet First League, when the vast majority of the Georgian clubs withdrew from the Soviet League system and joined the Georgian SSR regional league, as the first Umaglesi Liga. After bankruptcy in 1993, the club was re-founded in 1999. *FC Gagra was founded in 2004 as a continuation of the city of Gagra's disrupted by war football traditions, although a dormant amateur side in Gagra by the same name remains in the local Abkhaz league. Initially there have been efforts to move the Abkhaz team to Tskhaltubo, ground-sharing with Samgurali Tskhaltubo due to the number of internally displaced persons in the town but these plans failed due to lack of finances and facilities.http://futbolgrad.com/football-abkhazia-three-stories-gagra/ Due to the Georgian‚ÄìOssetian conflict, several teams have been displaced: *Spartaki Tskhinvali originally from the South Ossetian capital Tskhinvali currently play their league matches in either Gori or Tbilisi.http://futbolgrad.com/spartaki-tskhinvali-georgias-football-memorial- south-ossetia/ Germany While football club moves have so far been unusual in West German football, it was a rather common practice in communist East Germany. As teams were dependent on the regime, it intervened several times to promote an equal distribution of teams across the country. A number of prominent East German teams were affected by these political moves, and even in modern-day Germany, the reason for the regional dominance of some teams and the roots of many strong rivalries can be found there. Major moves in the DDR-Oberliga: *In 1954, the entire team of Empor Lauter, a club from a small industrial town in southern Saxony, moved to the very north of the country to compete as Empor Rostock. Under the name Hansa Rostock, they have been the most successful East German team since 1990. *Also in 1954, Dynamo Dresden lost all its players to the newly formed side of Dynamo Berlin. Dresden passed almost a decade in the lower leagues, returned to top-level football in 1962 and became one of the fiercest rivals of by-then record champion Dynamo Berlin. *Vorw√§rts Frankfurt (Oder) was the only major team to move twice. Founded as Vorw√§rts Leipzig in 1951, the team was moved to East Berlin in 1953, where they won six East German championships. They became Vorw√§rts Frankfurt in 1971 and were renamed to FFC Viktoria in 1991. In recent times, team moves have become a more common feature in sports that are less popular with the German public. Notable examples include former ice hockey team M√ºnchen Barons (became the Hamburg Freezers in 2002), former handball side VfL Bad Schwartau (became HSV Handball in 2002) and basketball club Bayer Giants Leverkusen (D√ºsseldorf Giants since 2008). Greece *Apollon Smyrni and Panionios were founded in 1891 and 1890 respectively in Smyrna (today Izmir) but moved to Athens in 1922 after the Greco-Turkish War in 1921 and the subsequent expulsion of Greeks from Turkey. In 1938 Panionios moved from Athens to the suburb of New Smyrna. Hungary Until the mid-2000s, moving and renaming smaller teams was a common method for larger teams in Hungary to evade their financial crisis or to level up in the league system without winning promotion on-pitch, a method that became so popular and controversial it had to be prohibited. *Di√≥sgy≈ëri VTK from Miskolc, then named Di√≥sgy≈ër FC went into bankruptcy after the 1999-2000 NB1 season. After immediately forming a fan-owned club in the seventh tier of the Hungarian league system, during the winter the club took over fellow Miskolc team Borsod Vol√°n SE to gain promotion to the third division. After years of third and second league football, the team gained promotion in 2004 on-pitch, but failed to obtain license for the 2004-05 NB1 season. Therefore the club took over Balaton FC, a team from Si√≥fok with financial problems, and took up the name Di√≥sgy≈ëri Balaton FC. After having two teams with two different coaches during the summer pre-season - one that gained promotion and one that got moved to Miskolc with the proper licensing -, and even being excluded from the league for a brief period, the team regained its original name DVTK and cemented itself in the highest tier of Hungarian football once more. *BFC Si√≥fok, which had its predecessor Balaton FC moved to Miskolc in 2004, bought the team of Bodajk playing in the second tier next year, and renamed itself to Bodajk FC Si√≥fok. *Vasas SC from Angyalf√∂ld, 13th district, Budapest: the six-time championship winner team, which already faced financial difficulties over the millenium, was relegated in the 2001-02 season after finishing third in the season before. In the second league, matters became worse, and the new owner J√°nos J√°mbor moved fellow second division team Kecskem√©ti TE to the capital and transforming it to the club's football team instead of saving the original. *Lombard P√°pa: P√©ter B√≠r√≥, owner of jewelry trader firm Lombard, was a long-time football investor, having been the owner of Tatab√°nya FC and Szombathelyi Halad√°s, both carrying the Lombard name during his reign respectively. In 2004, he decided to move his team to P√°pa, which meant that the team, never been playing in the first league before, took hold of the first league license of Szombathely. *Szombathelyi Halad√°s, in the same vein as its first league license got transferred to P√°pa, had bought Dabas and took hold its second league license just days after its demise. Italy =Association football= Current Italian football laws allow clubs to move only between bordering cities. Some examples include: *In 2003, after Cosenza Calcio 1914 was not admitted to Serie B, a new ownership bought sports rights from then-Serie D club Castrovillari in order to permit a Cosenza franchise to play football in the upcoming season. The new club however proved to be short- lived, as it declared bankruptcy in 2007, but was promptly replaced by Fortitudo Cosenza, born as a move of neighbouring Serie D club Rende Calcio. *Serie D's Neapolis, located in Naples, was born as a move of Sangiuseppese, a club hailing from the neighbouring city of San Giuseppe Vesuviano. *In 1994, one year after the cancellation of Calcio Catania, Atletico Leonzio's chairman Franco Proto moved his club, renaming it Atletico Catania. The club, previously located in Lentini, went on to play up to Serie C1 (the league now known as Lega Pro Prima Divisione), losing promotion to Serie B on playoffs twice before being cancelled in 2001 because of financial difficulties also related to Calcio Catania's return into professional football and the consequent drop in attendance. *A.C.D. Citt√† di Vittoria, born in 2007 as merger of Serie D's Comiso with minor league club Junior Vittoria (possibly a trick in order to allow the club to legally move from Comiso to Vittoria). *A.S.D. Pol. Libertas Acate of Serie D are a club officially settled in Acate, which however actually plays their home matches in Modica and are recognized by both fans and the regional press as Modica's club, being frequently referred to as Libertas Acate-Modica. In fact, after a takeover bid in 2006 the club left Acate to play their home matches in Modica despite the fact they were not eligible to change the \\"legal\\" home city. *S.S. Racing Club Roma was founded in summer 2013, after that A.S.D. Real T.B.M. Zagarolo transferred the seat and its sports title of Eccellenza to the city of Frascati, becoming A.S.D. Lupa Castelli Romani. *Lupa Frascati in the season 2013‚Äì14 the club moved to Axa district of Rome changing its name to A.S.D. Lupa Roma, and playing the home matches in nearby Stadio Pietro Desideri of Fiumicino. In the next season it was promoted to Lega Pro as Group G champions, changing its name again to Lupa Roma F.C. as a sign of return to the professional ranks after a 34-season absence. The team had to also move its home in Aprilia due to the Fiumicino field being unfit for professional league games, and the immediate lack of an available venue in Rome. In 2016‚Äì17 season the club moved to Stadio Olindo Galli of Tivoli. The legal address of the club also moved to the same municipality of Greater Rome. =Basketball= *Before the 2010‚Äì11 season, Triboldi were legally domiciled in Soresina, but played their home games in nearby Cremona, a community in the same Province. The club has now changed its domicile to Cremona. *Nuova Sebastiani Basket moved from Rieti, a city in the Lazio region near Rome, to the southern city of Naples effective with the 2009‚Äì10 season. Ireland Irish clubs moving out of their original district are slightly more common. In certain cases, the club has moved within a conurbation. *Shamrock Rovers Played in Glenmalure Park on the Southside of Dublin from 1926 to 1987. The club's owner Louis Kilcoyne announced he was selling Glenmalure Park, which they had recently purchased from the Jesuits. The team played the entire 1987‚Äì88 season in an almost empty Tolka Park on Dublin's Northside as a result of a boycott called for by the Shamrock Rovers Supporters Club and KRAM (Keep Rovers At Milltown), which was observed by the vast majority of Hoops fans. Following the completion of the boycott season in Tolka, the Kilcoynes sold the football club to Dublin businessman, John McNamara, who put forward a controversial proposal to move in with Rivals Bohemians at Dalymount Park. KRAM congregated to vote on whether to lift the boycott and on the proposal to move to Dalymount. Both motions were passed and the club spent the next two seasons at the Phibsboro venue, with an unrecognisable side playing in front of small attendances. Rovers spent two season's in Dalymount Park before moving to the RDS Arena in Ballsbridge, just two miles away from Glenmalure Park. In 1996, the club's new owner Alan McGrath unveiled a plan to build a permanent home state-of-the-art stadium in the Dublin southwest suburb of Tallaght for Rovers, The club also played home matches in Morton Stadium, Richmond Park and again in Tolka Park before moving to their new home in Tallaght in 2009. *Shelbourne were originally from Ringsend in the South of Dublin. The club played in Harold's Cross Stadium in Harold's Cross briefly in the 1970s before moving to the stadium in 1982 where they remained until 1989 when they moved to Tolka Park, in the North of Dublin. Kazakhstan *Founded in 1958, Torpedo Kokshetau, was in 1997 renamed Avtomobilist Shortandy and moved to Shortandy, an Astana suburb. In 1998, it was renamed Khimik Stepnogorsk and moved to Stepnogorsk. After another renaming in 1999 to FK Akmola, the club moved back to the Torpedo Stadium in Kokshetau a year later. The club competes as FC Okzhetpes since 2004. *Energetik Pavlodar until 2008 represented Pavlodar. In 2008 the team moved to Ekibastuz and played as Energetik-2 Ekibastuz. In 2009 it was renamed to Ekibastuz FK.–ß–ï–ú–ü–ò–û–ù–ê–¢ –ö–ê–ó–ê–•–°–¢–ê–ù–ê –ü–û –§–£–¢–ë–û–õ–£ - 2009. –ü–ï–†–í–ê–Ø –õ–ò–ì–ê Latvia *FK J≈´rmala, founded in 2003, moved from J≈´rmala to Riga in March 2012 and renamed themselves after the historic Riga club, becoming FK Daugava. *RAF Jelgava in the early 1990s RAF was one of the strongest teams in Virslƒ´ga. However, when the plant ran into financial difficulties, the team received new sponsorship from the University of Latvia in 1996 and, as a result, changed their name and moved to Riga, and played in the Latvian University Stadium.Virsliga table 1996 at RSSSF.com. Note E explains the relocation to Riga. Retrieved 30 November 2006 The move was a sporting disaster and the club folded. A team under the name RAF Jelgava appeared again in 2001 in the 1. lƒ´ga, and after the 2003 season the club merged with another Jelgava club, FK Viola Jelgava forming FK Jelgava. Lithuania *FK Kareda ≈†iauliai was a team from the city of Kaunas, founded in 1935, which moved from ≈†iauliai to Kaunas in 2000 becoming FK Kareda Kaunas.

Moldova  *FC Tiraspol was founded in Chi»ôinƒÉu in 1992 as Constructorul Chi»ôinƒÉu. Before the 2001‚Äì02 season, the club moved to Cioburciu, Transnistria, a small village outside Tiraspol, and was renamed Constructorul Cioburciu before moving to Tiraspol, the capital of the breakaway republic of Transnistria, a year later and adopting the current name in 2002. *FC Veris, founded in DrƒÉgƒÉne»ôti, S√Ængerei District, moved to Chi»ôinƒÉu. Netherlands Team moves are very rare in the Netherlands. The most prominent case involves professional football club Almere City FC. When 1964 Eredivisie champion and 1964‚Äì65 European Cup quarter finalist DWS was merged into FC Amsterdam, its supporters founded amateur football club De Zwarte Schapen, named after their nickname, which translates as Black Sheep. The club quickly rose through the ranks of amateur football, eventually reaching the Hoofdklasse. After several violent incidents on the pitch and a six-month suspension by the Royal Dutch Football Association, the club moved from Amsterdam to nearby Almere (a \\"new town\\") and changed its name to Sporting Flevoland. That name was changed to FC Omniworld in the 1990s, and FC Omniworld was admitted to the Eerste Divisie for the 2005‚Äì06 season. Team moves are slightly more common in other sports in the Netherlands. Volleyball club AMVJ, for instance, moved from Amsterdam to Amstelveen in 1980. The men's team was subsequently moved to Almere in 1999, becoming VC Omniworld, the volleyball branch of the aforementioned FC Omniworld. Norway The most notable example is the 1996 move of the ice hockey team Spektrum Flyers from Oslo to Bergen. Otherwise, team moves are rare, although mergers, for instance of teams of neighboring settlements, are common. Moving has sometimes happened on the top level of women's football. SK Sprint-Jel√∏y was moved from Jel√∏y to Moss under the new name FK Athene Moss. Asker Fotball's women's team was absorbed by Stab√¶k Fotball ahead of the 2009 season. Ahead of the 2010 season Team Str√∏mmen FK (which formerly had been moved from Aurskog-H√∏land) was absorbed by Lillestr√∏m SK, and Gj√∏vik FK absorbed by Raufoss IL. Poland *Olimpia Pozna≈Ñ was moved from Pozna≈Ñ and merged with Lechia Gda≈Ñsk in 1995 creating Olimpia-Lechia Gda≈Ñsk. It only lasted one season in the top division and by 1997 it was already in the third division. The club tried to rescue its fall through another merger with local club Polonia Gda≈Ñsk, in turn dropping Olimpia's heritage and changing its name to Lechia-Polonia Gda≈Ñsk, with Antoni Ptak's company as the main sponsor. In 2001 Lechia decided to leave the merger, and started as an independent club from the bottom of the football pyramid as the sole legal and spiritual continuator of BKS Lechia, which folded the merged club in 2002, forcing Polonia to start in a lower league as well. *Pogo≈Ñ Szczecin in 2002 was on the brink of bankruptcy. As a result, fans created a new team on the basis of the reserves in the fourth division. However owner of Piotrcovia Piotrk√≥w Trybunalski Antoni Ptak decided to move the team and renamed the club MKS Pogo≈Ñ Szczecin. The initial distrust was lost when the team performed well and used local players, however halfway through the 2005/2006 season the team started underperforming and Ptak decided to replace almost the entire squad with only Brazilian nationals, making it the \\"most Brazilian team outside Brazil\\". Antoni Ptak also built a small training facility in Gut√≥w Ma≈Çy, meaning the home games were played almost away from Szczecin. The experiment failed and in 2007 Antoni Ptak moved away from football, leaving the club to be rebuilt on the basis of the 4th division counterpart set up originally by the fans, which acted as the reserve team in the meantime. *Prokom Trefl Sopot was a successful basketball team, however it moved from Sopot to Gdynia and was renamed Asseco Prokom Gdynia. A phoenix club was set up straight away in 2009 called Trefl Sopot. *Sok√≥≈Ç Pniewy was moved to Tychy and merged with the local club GKS Tychy, which resulted in unorthodox renaming, first to Sok√≥≈Ç Pniewy in Tychy, then from 9 January 1996 Sok√≥≈Ç Tychy. After 26 games in its 2nd season the new fused club folded, leaving the reserve team Sok√≥≈Ç Pniewy in the fourth division to become its senior team, whereas GKS Tychy started anew. *WKS Zawisza Bydgoszcz was founded in Koszalin, however a year later in 1947, being an army club, when the army offices moved to Bydgoszcz so did the team, however up until that point the team only played friendly matches.http://www.zawiszafans.pl/klub/historia *Zawisza Bydgoszcz SA was a club that was created when Kujawiak W≈Çoc≈Çawek were moved to Bydgoszcz and renamed by Hydrobudowa, their owners. The original WKS Zawisza Bydgoszcz continued playing in the fourth division,http://bydgoszcz.gazeta.pl/bydgoszcz/1,35591,3095744.html however the new club had a very similar logo and an identical name, resulting in an unusual situation of having two almost identical clubs playing in 2 different divisions; for the purposes disambiguation, the new merged Zawisza was called Zawisza Bydgoszcz (2) by official sources and Kujawiak/Zawisza or Hydrobudowa Bydgoszcz by many others. As a result of the merger, Kujawiak, Zawisza and supporters all over the country boycotted the moved team.http://zawiszafans.net/news/289_JEDNAK_ZAWISZAHYDROBUDOWA_BYDGOSZCZ_.html The reserve team continued to play under the name Kujawiak W≈Çoc≈Çawek in the Fourth Polish league.

Romania  *Astra Ploie»ôti was moved in September 2012 from Ploie»ôti to Giurgiu becoming Astra Giurgiu. *CS Buftea was founded in 2005 after a merger between a local team from Buftea, which was playing in the fourth division and Cimentul Fieni, being located only 20 km north-west of Bucharest, in the town of Buftea, Ilfov County. The club had originally a red, white and blue combination of colours and played its home matches on OrƒÉ»ôenesc Stadium. In 2013-2016, the club moved three times.

After financial problems, the club started in 2017 a collaboration with FCSB, having some young players on loan from the multiple champions of Romania. *Damila MƒÉciuca was founded in 2010. In the summer of 2013 after the over average performance of the team and also the ranking that was with 3 places and 10 points over CSM R√¢mnicu V√¢lcea, county's first team, appeared the idea that Damila should be the new team of the city of R√¢mnicu V√¢lcea.Niculescu dezvƒÉluie noua denumire a Damilei: \\"O spun √Æn premierƒÉ\\". liga2.prosport.ro After several rounds of negotiations Daniel Ni»õu (Damila's owner) and CƒÉtƒÉlin RufƒÉ (CSM's owner) changed the camps, so RufƒÉ became the new owner of the white and greens and also the squads were changed between them.Tranzac≈£ia dintre Ni≈£u ≈üi RufƒÉ, votatƒÉ √Æn unanimitate de CL. liga2.prosport.ro After the transaction RufƒÉ has received the financial support of the Re»ôi»õa Municipality, with the condition that the club must change its name, headquarters, colors and stadium.

In 1997, the club was moved to Suceava after it won the promotion to the Divizia A for the first time in history. The main reason for the move was the inadequate state of Foresta's stadium in FƒÉlticeni, which was both small and had a cracked stand.

Tavriya added to Ukraininan Amateur League United Kingdom Latin America Team moves in Latin America occur very rarely for the established teams with established bases. Smaller teams, either small team from large agglomerations or provincial teams with little or no fan base frequently move in search of a larger market and/or more affordable facilities, as frequently, there are only large complexes available with a necessity to groundshare with a larger club. The practice is considered anathema. Brazil In Brazil, the first move of a first division football team was in 2010. Gr√™mio Barueri moved to Presidente Prudente, becoming Gr√™mio Prudente, only to return as Gr√™mio Barueri in the middle of 2011.

Asia Team moves in Asia are done according to the type of sport played and/or the predominant style of league organization, as well as individual economic circumstances. For instance, in Japan there is a difference between Nippon Professional Baseball which is run like MLB, and the J.League which is run like European football leagues. Club moves are also common when an amateur or semiprofessional club tries to acquire its own facilities to become a professional club, and no money and/or space is available to build their own in a long-established location. China Team moves in China are very common, as teams are privately owned or owned by businesses, and there are neither rules regarding moves nor many established fan bases outside of the handful of established top teams: =Association football= *Bayi F.T. was a club under the sport branch of the People's Liberation Army, founded in 1927, one of the oldest clubs in the country. The club's reign as one of the most successful clubs in China would end with the advent of professionalism within the league. When the first fully professional league season started in 1994 the club were given special dispensation to remain as semi-professional as possible by having all their members remain active military members, however the club did start to take in sponsorship money to pay for the cost of running the club. At first little changed and the team even came third within the 1996 league season. Where the club really struggled was their ability to hold on to their contingent of Chinese international players such as Hao Haidong, Hu Yunfeng and Jiang Jin who started to leave the club for better offers. This saw the club struggle being unable to replace them through the transfer market and ultimately see them relegated to the second tier for the first time in the club's history. With less money coming in the club decided to disassociate themselves from their traditional Beijing home and took offers from other cities and sponsors to play for. They moved to Xinxiang and Liuzhou to accommodate their sponsors and while this worked for a brief period, which saw the club gain promotion back into the top tier the Chinese FA launched the rebranded Chinese Super League, which required more stringent conditions for the club to work in. Unfortunately this coincided with the loss in form of the team who were relegated at the end of the 2003 league season. The loss of prize money and stricter regulations ultimately forced Bayi to disband. *Gansu Tianma was a football team based in Lanzhou, Gansu, who were relegated to the Yi League in 2004 and sold to Dongguan Dongcheng who moved the club to the Hong Kong First Division League.

South Korea =Association football= Football club moves were frequent in the 1980s and 1990s. South Korea has three national tiers, but as in the North American system, there was initially no promotion or relegation between them. There were 3 professional football clubs Ilhwa Chunma (currently Seongnam FC), LG Cheetahs (currently FC Seoul), Yukong Elephants (currently Jeju United) in Seoul by 1995. However, due to K League's decentralization policy, these three clubs were forced to move to other cities in 1996, changing their name in the process. These moves are done under the accord that if any of these teams build a football specific stadium in Seoul, they can return there, of which 2 clubs took advantage of. As a result, the following moves occurred: * Ilhwa Chunma became Cheonan Ilhwa Chunma based in Cheonan, 95 km away.

The reserve side, Sangmu B, competed in the K2 League from 2003 to 2005 before joining the K League's reserve league, and was based in Icheon for the three years it competed at division 2 level. The club's hometown was moved from Gwangju to Sangju, Gyeongsangbuk-do after Gwangju founded the new professional club Gwangju FC in 2011. =Other sports= In South Korean major professional sports such as Korea Professional Baseball, Korean Basketball League, V-League, moves were common. In ice hockey, Mando Winia were a team based in Mok-dong, Seoul, which moved to Anyang, Gyeonggi in 2005 and became Anyang Halla. Thailand *Prachinburi United F.C. in early 2012 moved to Klaeng District Stadium, Rayong, Rayong Province after moving from Prachinburi Province. They currently play at the Rayong Province Central Stadium. India In 2019, the Delhi Dynamos moved from Delhi to Bhubaneswar, Odisha, and renamed the club Odisha FC. Africa South Africa In South Africa most football clubs are privately owned, and club moves are relatively common. Several clubs, including top division Premier Soccer League clubs have moved and taken on new identities. There are many other cases of South African moves. The ease of selling and buying of club licences make moves common and sometimes difficult to determine what determines a continuation of a relocated club or whether it is an entirely separate new entity. *Bay United became Polokwane City in 2012 when the club had moved from Port Elizabeth to Polokwane. *Benoni Premier United moved to Kwa-Zulu Natal and became Thanda Royal Zulu. *Hellenic F.C.'s franchise was sold by the Greek owners in early 2004 to the Ndlovu family who renamed it Premier United and moved it to Benoni, Gauteng. In 2011, the Hellenic franchise took over the former Blaauwberg City FC, under the management of Mark Byrne. Byrne is looking to revive the quality of the 1970s, to become one of the best youth developments in the country. In 2013, the club acquired a SAB League franchise (South African 4th Division). In August 2016, the club announced that they had sold their SAFA Second Division franchise license to \\"ensure that we grow from strength to strength in achieving our aim to be the number one youth structure in Cape Town.\\"https://www.facebook.com/HellenicFootballClub/posts/1106847482726750 *Khakhu Fast XI initially were founded as an amateur club in 1937, and represented the local city Khakhu, located 170 km northeast of Polokwane. Ahead of the 1998‚Äì99 season, the club owner Joseph Mapfulagasha, moved the team about 30 km south to the city Mapate, and at the same time changed the name of the club to Mapate Silver Stars.Silver Stars became Platinum Stars as Royal Bafokeng Nation (RBN) entered as the club's sponsor in 2006 and moved the team to play at Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Phokeng. Club name also changed, when RBN bought 51% of the shares in May 2007. *Makwane Computer Stars were founded in 1977 in a small village of Makwane in an area then known as QwaQwa. They were then renamed Qwa-Qwa Stars before becoming Free State Stars after becoming based at Goble Park in Bethlehem. *Manning Rangers, based in Durban, declared bankruptcy in 2006. The Fidentia Group purchased the club in 2007 and renamed it the Fidentia Rangers however the new owners moved the club from Durban to Cape Town. *Nathi Lions was based in KwaMashu, roughly 30 kilometers North of Durban. The team franchise was renamed Atlie FC in 2011 and moved to Ekurhuleni. *Vasco da Gama in 2016 was moved to Stellenbosch as Stellenbosch F.C..

The Aswang is the subject of a wide variety of myths, stories, arts, and films, as it is well-known throughout the Philippines. Spanish colonists noted that the Aswang was the most feared among the mythical creatures of the Philippines, even in the 16th century. Although with no specific motive other than harming others, their behavior can be interpreted as an inversion of the traditional Filipino's values. The Aswang is especially popular in Visayas, southern parts of Luzon, and parts of Mindanao.  Historical Accounts  \\"The sixth was called silagan, whose office it was, if they saw anyone clothed in white, to tear out his liver and eat it, thus causing his death. This, like the preceding, was in the island of Catanduanes. Let no one, moreover, consider this a fable; because, in Calavan, they tore out in this way through the anus all the intestines of a Spanish notary, who was buried in Calilaya by father Fray Juan de M√©rida. The seventh was called magtatangal, and his purpose was to show himself at night to many persons, without his head or entrails. In such wise the devil walked about and carried, or pretended to carry, his head to different places; and, in the morning, returned it to his body‚Äîremaining, as before, alive. This seems to me to be a fable, although the natives affirm that they have seen it, because the devil probably caused them so to believe. This occurred in Catanduanes. The eighth they called osuang, which is equivalent to 'sorcerer;' they say that they have seen him fly, and that he murdered men and ate their flesh. This was among the Visayas Islands; among the Tagalos these did not exist.\\" Fr. Juan de Plasencia, Customs of the Tagalogs (1589)  Description and taxonomy  According to Maximo Ramos, the term \\"aswang\\" can be thought of as an aggregate term for a multitude of Filipino supernatural creatures. These creatures can be organized into five categories that parallel creatures from Western traditions. These categories are the vampire, the self-segmenting viscera sucker, the weredog, the witch, and the ghoul.  The vampire  The vampire aswang disguises itself in the shape of a beautiful woman. It shares its diet of blood with vampires of Western cultures. However, it differs by sucking blood using a proboscis-like tongue, rather than sharpened teeth. Furthermore, aswang do not live in tombs. Some live in forests far from human communities, but the aswang can infiltrate human society by means of marrying into a community, and either slowly draining their husband of blood, or else using it strictly as a hideout and leaving at night to raid other villages, thereby keeping their cover intact. One example of a vampire aswang is the Tagalog mandurugo, said to live in the region of Capiz.  The viscera sucker  The viscera sucker is said to have a diet of internal organs, or the phlegmatic discharge of the sick. Like the vampire aswang, it consumes its food with its tongue, narrow and tubular, but not pointed like the vampire. By day, it takes the shape of an attractive, light-skinned, and long-haired woman. By night, it grows wings and segments itself, leaving behind its body from the waist downwards. It takes great care to hide its lower half, then flies in searches for victims. It is particularly attracted to the fetuses growing inside pregnant women. Viscera suckers are said to live in domiciles deep in the jungle, if not the trees themselves. But like the vampire aswang, most infiltrate human communities via marriage.  The weredog  Maximo Ramos refers to this category as the weredog, though the creature does not necessarily transform into a dog. Ramos reasons that the werecreature of a given region is named after their most ferocious creature. As such, for example, Europe has werewolves, India has weretigers, Africa has wereleopards, and Russia has werebears. The Philippines has no indigenous wolf population, thus making weredog the more appropriate term. Like the previous aswang, the weredog infiltrates villages and turns into a creature by night, around midnight. The creature is most commonly a dog, but a cat or pig is also possible. The weredog then kills and eats people, particularly pregnant women on the road in the night, and do not let their long hair hang loose. (Doing so is said to protect against these aswang.) The weredog is said to develop a taste for human flesh by eating food spat on, or licked, by another weredog. (The same is said of the viscera sucker.) Unlike the previous aswang, the weredog does not infiltrate human communities through marriage, but as a traveler of some sort, such as a peddler or a construction labourer.  The witch  Witch aswang are characterized by extreme vindictiveness, laying curses upon those who have crossed her by making certain objects, such as rice, bones, or insects, come out of the bodily orifices of the cursed. Witches have eyes that reflect images upside down, as well as elongated irises. They live in the outskirts of towns and villages. Witches in the Philippines are feared, avoided and hated. Witches can become aswang, only if they have certain qualities that follow an aswang already. Then they can become an aswang, and by doing so their powers become stronger, stronger than the other witches as well. If an aswang is caught, they are to be immediately killed without question. Though with witches there is just complete avoidance by the people and people around them regard them with fear. Though if an incident were to happen near the witch's residence, then there is reason to turn to the witch to blame and punish.  The ghoul  Ghoul aswang are described as humanoid but generally hidden. Their diet consists of human corpses, they are carrion-eaters. Their nails and teeth are sharp and strong to help with the theft and consumption of the corpses. Their diet makes them smell rank and pungent. They gather in trees near cemeteries to exhume and consume the fresh burials.  Behaviour  Aswangs commonly dwell at night in locations such as cemeteries and woods, as their powers are significantly, or sometimes totally, reduced during the daytime. However, despite being described as wild monsters that often live in the wilderness and outskirts of society, aswangs are also described as creatures that are capable of living within close proximity of or even within the confines of a village, leading to several reports of aswang attacks within large, populated towns and cities. Their ability to adapt and live within the urban and rural environments populated by humans while still maintaining their feral, monstrous nature is cited as a feature that distinguishes aswangs from most other monsters. Aswangs also generally have a fear of light. Wakes were often brightly lit to ensure that aswang would not come to the funeral to steal and devour the corpse. They also have a disdain for noise, but rare occasions describe aswangs attending noisy parties. Aswangs are traditionally described as one- dimensional monsters and inherently evil by nature with no explicable motives beyond harming and devouring other creatures. Their overtly evil behaviour may be described as an inversion of traditional Filipino values. Traditional aswangs have no bias when selecting their prey and will not hesitate to target their own kin: an inversion of the traditional Filipino value of strong kinship and family closeness. Aswangs are described to be unclean and favor raw human meat to contrast the value of cleanliness and the cooked, spiced, and flavourful food found in traditional Filipino culture. The aswangs are also often described to be lewd in behaviour, with female aswangs often exposing their genitals to contrast values of traditional modesty.  Countermeasures  There are several remedies and countermeasures to drive away or slay aswang. The different countermeasures often vary depending on the cultural and symbolic significance of each tool. Holy objects, spices, salt, ash, the tail of a sting-ray, large crustaceans, vinegar, betel nut chew, and urine are all listed as tools for protection against aswang. The reversal of a ladder leading to the house was also said to be a countermeasure against aswang. Because aswang were believed to be the cause of miscarriages, countermeasures to drive aswang away and prevent them from prowling during childbirth were developed. One method is for the husband of the child-bearing wife to remain under the house naked while furiously waving a sword. Sharp sticks or bolos should be inserted between the bamboos of the house floor to prevent aswangs from lurking under the house. Additionally, sick people should not stay in houses with holes and are told not to groan in order not to attract aswang. There is also a special anti-aswang oil that can be developed. To make this oil, select a particular coconut and watch it grow. Pick it at twilight during a full moon when it is wet and gloomy; the breeze should also be chilly. The coconut should be grated and its juice must be squeezed out. Boil the mixture until it becomes oil. Recite secret prayers and throw all the waste into the ocean so that aswang cannot trace whoever made the oil. Once complete, the oil should be hung at the door of the house; it will boil when an aswang is near. There are other methods of detecting aswang without the use of the special oil. Scratching noises heard from the ceiling of a house is often a sign of a nearby aswang. Aswangs in disguise can be detected by seeing if your reflection in the creature's eye is inverted. Additionally, dogs, cats, and pigs with no tails are said to be aswangs in disguise. During holy masses, aswangs will also dodge attempt to dodge the blessings. To kill a witch aswang, a bolo knife can be used to strike the middle of the witch's back; if that area is not struck, the witch can lick its wounds to heal its injuries. After slaying an aswang with a bolo, the bolo must be planted under the ground. Firearms are not advised for killing aswangs and it is useless to stab and slash at an aswang while it is in the form of an animal. Magic prayers can be used to make the aswang vulnerable; while it is in this helpless state, its body must be cut into pieces. If the aswang is cut into two pieces, each piece must be separated and taken to opposite river banks.  Origins and influences  Because of the archipelagic geography of the Philippines, and the primarily oral mode of inheriting and imparting narratives from the past for preservation or didactic purposes, stories about the aswang have evolved and adapted according to the locality in question. The Aswang was born out of Philippine folklore, with stories of this terrifying creature dating back to at least the 16th century, when Spanish explorers created the first written record of monster. The explorers noted that of all the monsters in their folklore, the Aswang was the most feared by native people. One of the most famous origins of the term aswang came from the aswang tradition in the Bicol region during the sixteenth century. The Bicolanos believed in the God named Gugurang, who was the good God that acted as the beneficent of their region, the defender and guardian of their homes, and their protector against the evil of the God Asuang. The God Asuang, however, was the evil God and rival, who attempted to always cause harm to Gugurang and found pleasure in doing so. Gugurang was always praised by the Bicolanos, and Asuang shunned and cursed. However, in another story, Gugurang is portrayed as a fire-wielding God who, if displeased with the humans, would cause Mt. Mayon to erupt. Aswang had no control over the people and became jealous of Gugurang's power. As Aswang begged for Gugurang's fire, Gugurang felt that Aswang was only trying to have fire to win the favor of the people, and the two began to argue for centuries. But Aswang was able to steal fire by turning himself invisible and hiding the fire in a coconut shell. However, Aswang was unable to control the power and caused the entire world to catch flames. Gugurang followed the flames which led him to Aswang and took the fire back. He called the Gods to help him put out the fire with rain and take revenge on Aswang by making thunder and lightning to strike the mountains. The act brought upon all the evils and destruction in the land, which the people had never forgotten Aswang for.  Home of the aswang  Aswang are most commonly associated with the province of Capiz, which lies on the island of Panay at the Western Visayas region, so much so that Capiz has come to be dubbed as the creature's \\"hometown\\". In an April 29, 2019 documentary of Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho (KMJS), aswang are also allegedly sighted in Himamaylan, Negros Occidental, which also lies at Western Visayas, where several residents have been reportedly terrorized by the appearance of the aswang at night. (10:29) Ang maaaring pinanggagalingan daw ng kababalaghan ang punong ito. Ipinakita namin ang video kay Dr. Jose Pamparos, city veterinarian, ayon sa kanya ang posibleng nakuhanan ng video hindi aswang kundi isang uri ng paniki o fruit bat. Madalas daw talaga mapagkamalang ng mga ito na aswang. The KMJS team tried to substantiate the resident's claim by installing cameras to capture the alleged creature, but to no avail. From the lens of social anthropology, what inspired the legends of the aswang can be traced back to two possible sources: the behaviour of the wildlife within the region, and the prominence of X-linked dystonia parkinsonism within the region. = Wildlife behaviour = Sounds attributed to the aswang's hunting calls (\\"tiktik\\" and \\"wakwak\\") are similar to the sounds of nocturnal forest wildlife such as bats and Philippine flying lemurs (which is locally called kagwang). The sounds they make have resulted in their being hunted, under the suspicions that these creatures are aswang in disguise. = Prominence of X-linked dystonia parkinsonism = X-linked dystonia parkinsonism (XDP) is a genetic form of dystonia found almost entirely among males of Filipino descent (XDP Canada). It is also known as the Dystonia of Panay, due to the fact that most current cases today can be traced back to a common ancestor in Panay. According to most recent studies, 93% of current cases today are located on Panay Island, with 63% of those being located in Capiz. Individuals diagnosed with this disease exhibit debilitating symptoms that put them in a \\"transforming state\\", which results in their \\"bod[ies] twisting, tongue[s] protruding from their mouth[s], [and] salivating.\\" With the disorder being endemic to the region for generations, the visible symptoms have been interpreted as a major contribution to the prevalence of narratives surrounding Capiz as the home of the aswang. Individuals afflicted with this disease are branded as aswang and are socially ostracized, which prevent their families from seeking effective medical treatment and forcing them to isolate themselves from the larger community.  Influences in contemporary society  The folklore of the aswang has been interpreted as having influenced certain idiosyncrasies of the Filipino people. Maximo Ramos, focusing on the ghoul-aspect and viscera-sucker aspect of the aswang, proposes that certain behaviours of modern-day Filipinos can be traced back to older traditions and customs that were geared towards protecting themselves from the aswang. Some of the contemporary behaviours he mentions include: * The vociferous nature of Filipino gatherings, as compared to the solemn and subdued natures of other ethnic groups. This is most obvious when Filipinos meet with each other in non-Philippine settings. *The floors aren't swept while the dead is lying in state for sweeping the floor would spread the scent of death around the area, which would attract ghouls. *A chicken whose jugular vein is cut is tossed down the steps and is allowed to flutter away and die while the dead is carried out of the house. The chicken would serve as a distraction for the ghouls. *In some parts of Luzon, orphans wear red strips of cloth around their wrists, necks, and waists, since red represents fire, a common countermeasure against ghouls. This can explain why \\"peasant Filipinos\\" prefer the red clothing which is seen in their dances and in their costumes. (The ghouls have acute hearing but blurred vision.) *Widows and widowers do not marry for at least a year after the spouse's death, for the new spouse may be mistaken for the old one. This fact explains the unpopularity of recently in tradition- bound communities.  Portrayals in media   In film  The aswang have been the focus of Philippine horror and thriller films: * Some of these movies include Maria Labo (2015), Aswang (1992), and Corazon: Ang Unang Aswang (2012). * They are also featured in the popular Shake, Rattle & Roll horror film franchise: particularly Shake, Rattle & Roll 2 (1990), Shake, Rattle & Roll 2k5 (2005), and Shake, Rattle & Roll 8 (2006). *The Aswang Phenomenon is a 2011 documentary that explains the myth of the aswang in the Philippines. The Aswang are also featured in the following Western films: * Surviving Evil (2009) is a British horror film directed and written by Terence Daw. It follows documentary filmmakers who travel to a Philippine island, only to discover that a colony of shape shifting, carnivorous aswang inhabit the island. * Vampariah (2016) is an American horror film following an elite team of hunters, with a mission to keep the world safe from creatures of the night. However, a fateful encounter with an aswang compromises this mission for one of the members. * The aswang myth is briefly featured in Canadian fantasy drama film The Forbidden Room (2015).  In television  * The Aswang are featured as primary antagonists in the ABS-CBN teleserye Juan dela Cruz. * The Face Off episode \\"Bloodsuckers\\" featured contestant Niko Gonzalez working on a prosthetic with an aswang design. * The episode \\"Blood Moon\\" of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation included a reference to the aswang, which was described as a hybrid cross between a vampire and werewolf. * An aswang is featured in the sixth episode of the Canadian TV show Lost Girl, and is portrayed as a relatively harmless scavenger Fae. * Season 3, episode 14 entitled \\"Mommy Dearest\\" of Grimm centered around an aswang, which sustained itself by sucking the amniotic fluid from pregnant women using its tongue to pierce the abdomen and amniotic sack via the mother's umbilicus.  In literature  *The Aswang appear as a mafia in the comic Trese, a Filipino dark fantasy comic that focuses on supernatural creatures from Philippine folklore.

The shooting guard (SG), also known as the two, two guard or off guard,Shooting guards are 6'3\\"‚Äì6'7\\". BBC Sports academy. URL last accessed 2006-09-09. is one of the five traditional positions in a regulated basketball game. A shooting guard's main objective is to score points for their team and steal the ball on defense. Some teams ask their shooting guards to bring up the ball as well; these players are known colloquially as combo guards. A player who can switch between playing shooting guard and small forward is known as a swingman. In the NBA, shooting guards usually range from 6' 3\\" (1.90 m) to 6' 6\\" (1.98 m), and from 5' 8\\" (1.73 m) to 5' 11\\" (1.80 m) in the WNBA.  Characteristics and styles of play  The Basketball Handbook by Lee Rose describes a shooting guard as a player whose primary role is to score points. As the name suggests, most shooting guards are good long-range shooters, typically averaging 35-40 percent from three-point range. Many shooting guards are also strong and athletic, and have the ability to get inside the paint and drive to the basket. Typically, shooting guards are taller than point guards. Height at the position varies; many bigger shooting guards also play small forward. Shooting guards should be good ball handlers and be able to pass reasonably well, though passing is not their main priority. Since good shooting guards may attract double-teams, they are frequently the team's back-up ball handlers to the point guard and typically get a fair number of assists. Shooting guards must be able to score in various ways, especially late in a close game when defenses are tighter. They need to have a good free throw percentage too, to be reliable in close games and to discourage opposing players from fouling. Because of the high level of offensive skills shooting guards need, they are often a team's primary scoring option, and sometimes the offense is built around them. In the NBA, there are some shooting guards referred to as \\"3 and D\\" players. The term 3 and D implies that the player is a good 3 point shooter who can also play solid (sometimes elite) defense. The 3 and D player has become very important as the game sways to be perimeter oriented. Good shooting guards can often play point guard to a certain extent. It is usually accepted that point guards should have the ball in their hands at most times in the game, but sometimes the shooting guard has a significant enough influence on the team where he or she handles the ball extremely often, to the point where the point guard may be reduced to a backup ball handler or . Notable shooting guards Notable NBA and WNBA shooting guards include some of the greatest players of all time, including Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, DeMar DeRozan, Jimmy Butler, Joe Johnson, Dwyane Wade, Manu Gin√≥bili, Allen Iverson, Cynthia Cooper, James Harden, Tracy McGrady, Ray Allen, Clyde Drexler, George Gervin, Reggie Miller, Diana Taurasi, Klay Thompson, Paul George, and Donovan Mitchell.

It stands at the end of the former Military Ocean Terminal in Bayonne, New Jersey. Ceremonial groundbreaking occurred on September 16, 2005, in a ceremony attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin. The monument was dedicated on September 11, 2006, in a ceremony attended by former U.S. President Bill Clinton. Design The sculpture comprises a bronze-clad tower split with a jagged opening in the middle, in which hangs a -tall nickel-surfaced teardrop. The eleven sides of the monument's base bear granite name plates, on which are etched the names of those who died in the September 11 attacks and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. However, like some other 9/11 memorials, the dedication was based on an outdated compilation and contains about forty people who were removed from later victim listings. Tsereteli did not disclose the cost of the sculpture except to say that he paid for labor and materials. A lawyer for the sculptor released the cost at about $12 million. Tsereteli said metals for the sculpture were obtained \\"From a military factory that did airplanes. In Dzerzhinsk. A secret city.\\" Further information The monument was initially given to the local government of Jersey City, but was rejected. It was then relocated to its present placement in Bayonne. In August 2010 the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced it had plans to build a container facility on the location and the monument would most likely have to be moved. However, Robert \\"Captain Bob\\" Terzi, a Bayonne taxi driver started an online petition to prevent the relocation. It was listed as one of the world's ugliest statues by Foreign Policy magazine, while The New Yorker said that it looked like \\"a giant tea biscuit\\" from a distance. Pro Arts Jersey City called it \\"an insensitive, self-aggrandizing piece of pompousness by one of the world's blatant self-promoters\\". In September 2011, a section of steel from the World Trade Center was placed adjacent to the sculpture.

In basketball (and derivatives like netball), a player may attempt to score a basket by leaping straight into the air, the elbow of the shooting hand cocked, ball in hand above the head, and lancing the ball in a high arc towards the basket for a jump shot (colloquially, a jumper). Although early critics thought the leap might lead to indecision in the air, the jump shot replaced the earlier, less quickly released set shot, and eventually transformed the game because it is the easiest shot to make from a distance and more difficult for a defender to block. Variations on the simple jump shot include the \\"turnaround jumper\\" (facing away from the basket, then jumping and spinning towards it, shooting the ball in mid-air); the \\"fadeaway\\" (jumping away from the basket to create space); and the \\"leaning jumper\\" (jumping towards the basket to move away from a trailing defender). With the \\"hook shot,\\" a player is turned sideways with the shooting arm away from the basket outstretched so that with a sweep he can launch the ball over his head. Since a defender must leap to block a jumper, the shooter may use a pump fake to get the defender in the air at the wrong time and so have a clear shot. If the shooter leaps into the defender, a foul is called on the defensive player, whereat the shooter is awarded two or three free throws according to the value of a missed attempt, or a single free throw if he scores. Debate still continues as to who invented the jump shot. Although in the NCAA collegiate archives, John Miller Cooper, who played at the University of Missouri in the 1930s, is recognized as the person to hoist the first jump shot, in his The Origins of the Jump Shot, John Christgau makes a strong case that Ken Sailors did so in May 1934. Sailors went on to play for the University of Wyoming and was selected as MVP of their 1943 NCAA Championship team. Sailors also played for five different teams in the old American Basketball League. Other people that Christgau credits with the jump shot are Glen \\"Glenn\\" Roberts, Myer \\"Whitey\\" Skoog, John \\"Mouse\\" Gonzales, Bud Palmer, Davage \\"Dave\\" Minor, ‚ÄúJumping‚Äù Joe Fulks, Johnny Adams, and Belus Smawley.

The region's name originates from the ancient pre- Inca civilization of the Lambayeque. It is the second-smallest department in Peru after Tumbes, but it is also its most densely populated department and its eighth most populous department. Etymology The name Lambayeque is a Spanish derivation of the god Yampellec, said to have been worshipped by the first Lambayeque king, Naymlap. The Spanish gave the name to the early people. Geography The territory of the department of Lambayeque is made up of wide plains irrigated by rivers from the Andes; in most of the arid area, irrigation is needed to support any farming. The fertile river valleys produce half of the sugar cane crop of Peru. In addition, Lambayeque and the department of Piura provide most of the rice crops consumed in Peru. Increased agricultural harvest is expected with completion of the Olmos Transandino Project. The water supply project will transfer up to 2 billion m3 annually of water from the Huancabamba River in the department of Cajamarca east of Lambayeque. In the smaller scale farming of earlier centuries, the Olmos Carob Tree Forest supported goat herds that fed on carobs. The fine goatskins were tanned to create the fine, pale, leather known as \\"cordoban\\" or \\"cordovan\\", from the Spanish town of C√≥rdoba, where the process was developed. Goat fat was used to make soap. There are two small islands off the Pacific coast of the department of Lambayeque: Lobos de Afuera, and Lobos de Tierra; there was a dispute with the department of Piura over ownership of the latter island. The region is bordered by the Piura Region on the north, the Cajamarca Region on the southeast, the La Libertad Region on the south and the Pacific Ocean on the west. Political division Map of the Lambayeque region showing its provinces The department is divided into 3 provinces (provincias, singular: provincia), which are composed of 38 districts (distritos, singular: distrito). The provinces, with their capitals in parentheses, are: * Chiclayo (Chiclayo) * Ferre√±afe (Ferre√±afe) * Lambayeque (Lambayeque) History Legend tells that in ancient times, a great float of balsa rafts arrived at the beaches of the existing San Jos√© cove. Formed by a brilliant cortege of nine foreign warriors, this float was led by a man of great talent and courage, named Naymlap, the mythical founder of the first northwest civilization. Among the descendants of Naymlap were the Moche and the Chim√∫, the latter builders of a great civilization forged in Lambayeque before being conquered by the later Inca Empire. The Chim√∫ grew to acquire a notable state parallel to the Inca. The Chim√∫ moved their capital to the northern area, establishing great urban centers there. They were great farmers, textile experts and, wonderful goldsmiths, with extraordinary works in gold. The Inca conquest of what today is Lambayeque, lasted almost four decades. Pachacuti, Tupac Inca Yupanqui and Huayna C√°pac, successively, ruled during the process. In the 16th century, the Spaniard leader Francisco Pizarro took his conquistadors across the region on the way to Cajamarca to conclude the defeat of the Inca empire. He was amazed by the gold exposed in vases and utensils. During Colonial times, a rivalry started between the people of the towns of Lambayeque and Santiago de Miraflores de Sa√±a. The reason of the conflict was the opulence in which the latter lived, even provoking the greed of pirates. A flood in 1720, however, destroyed Sa√±a and marked the end of a flourishing city. The people of Lambayeque followed Juan Manuel Iturregui as their leader in the struggles for emancipation and independence from Spain. He spread the libertarian ideas and helped get arms for the cause.  Archaeology  In November 2019, Peruvian archaeologists led by Walter Alva discovered a 3,000-year-old, 130 feet long megalithic 'water cult' temple with 21 tombs in the Oyot√∫n district in the Za√±a Valley. Archaeologists assumed that the temple was abandoned around 250 BC and later used as a burial ground by the Chumy people. Twenty of the tombs belonged to the people of Chumy, and one to an adult male buried buried during the Formative period with a ceramic bottle with two spouts and a bridge handle. According to the excavations, as many as three construction phases took place in the temple: the first was between 1500 BC-800 BC, when people built the foundations of the building from cone-shaped clay; second, between 800 BC-400 BC, when the megalithic temple was built under the influence of the pre-Inca civilization known as the Chavin; and finally 400 BC-100 BC, when people added circular pillars used to hold the roof of the temple.Sip√°n Museum, in Lambayeque Presentation of a dish of Arroz con pato.

Whitewater rafting is possible due to the Ca√±ete River, which has rapids up to level 4. The main settlement in this district is the town of Lunahuan√°. History The remains of early Andean inhabitants, hunters and harpoon fishermen from more than 10,000 years ago, are to be found in the department of Lima. These remains were found in Chivateros, near the Chill√≥n River, and in various other places. These persons incorporated nets, hooks, farming, ceramics and weaving to their everyday objects. The inhabitants of the coast lived in the lomas and the valleys, where they built temples and dwelling complexes, leading to huge ceremonial centres, such as the Huacoy on the Chill√≥n River; Garagay and La Florida on the R√≠mac River, Manchay on the Lur√≠n River; and Chancay, Supe and many other valleys to the north and south. There are finely ornamented temples with figures modelled in clay. Lithic prehistoric projectile points of Paijan type were found at Anc√≥n, 40 kilometres northeast of Lima in the Chill√≥n River Valley. The 5,000-year- old ruins known as El Para√≠so are also located in this area. A temple at the site is believed to be about 5,000 years old. In 2006, a team of archeological researchers led by Robert Benfer announced their findings from a four-year excavation at Buena Vista in the Chill√≥n River valley a few kilometres north of present-day Lima. They had discovered a 4200-year-old observatory constructed by an early Andean civilization, a three-dimensional sculpture, unique for the time period in this region, and sophisticated carvings. The observatory is on top of a 10-meter pyramidal mound and has architectural features for sighting the astronomical solstices. The discovery pushes back the time for the development of complex civilisation in the area and has altered scholars' understanding of Preceramic period cultures in Peru.Richard Lovett, \\"Oldest Observatory in Americas Discovered in Peru\\", National Geographic, May 2006, accessed 2 Nov 2010 The Lima culture (100 A.D. to 650 A.D.) arose in this area, specially in the central valleys from Chancay to Lur√≠n. It was distinguished by painted adobe buildings. During this time, the Huari conquest took place, thus giving rise to Huari-style ceramics, together with a local style known as Niever√≠a. As the population grew, their culture changed. With the decline of the Huari, whose most important center was Cajamarquilla, new local cultures arose. The Chancay are the most well-known. They developed large urban centers and a considerable textile production, as well as mass-produced ceramics. At this stage in the mid-15th century, the Incas arrived from their base in the Andes. They conquered and absorbed the regional cultures and occupied important sites such as Pachacamac, turning it into an administrative centre.

The edges of tuyas can form ridges. Pirin Mountain main ridge - view from Koncheto knife-edge ridge towards the pyramidal peaks Vihren and Kutelo A ridge or a mountain ridge is a geographical feature consisting of a chain of mountains or hills that form a continuous elevated crest for some distance. The sides of the ridge slope away from narrow top on either side. The lines along the crest formed by the highest points, with the terrain dropping down on either side, are called the ridgelines. Ridges are usually termed hills or mountains as well, depending on size. Types There are several main types of ridges: * Dendritic ridge: In typical dissected plateau terrain, the stream drainage valleys will leave intervening ridges. These are by far the most common ridges. These ridges usually represent slightly more erosion resistant rock, but not always ‚Äì they often remain because there were more joints where the valleys formed or other chance occurrences. This type of ridge is generally somewhat random in orientation, often changing direction frequently, often with knobs at intervals on the ridge top. * Stratigraphic ridge: In places such as the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians, long, even, straight ridges are formed because they are the uneroded remaining edges of the more resistant dipping strata that were folded laterally. Similar ridges have formed in places such as the Black Hills, where the ridges form concentric circles around the igneous core. Sometimes these ridges are called \\"hogback ridges\\". * Oceanic spreading ridge: In tectonic spreading zones around the world, such as at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the volcanic activity forms new land between tectonic boundaries creating volcanic ridges at the spreading zone. Isostatic settling and erosion gradually reduces the elevations moving away from the zone. * Crater ridges: Large meteorite strikes typically form large impact craters bordered by circular ridges. * Volcanic crater/caldera ridges: Large volcanoes often leave behind a central crater/caldera bordered by circular ridges. * Fault ridges: Faults often form escarpments. Sometimes the tops of the escarpments form not plateaus but slope back so that the edges of the escarpments form ridges. * Dune ridges: In areas of large-scale dune activity, certain types of dunes result in sand ridges. * Moraines and eskers: Glacial activity may leave ridges in the form of moraines and eskers. An ar√™te is a thin ridge of rock that is formed by glacial erosion. * Volcanic subglacial ridges: Many subglacial volcanoes create ridge- like formations when lava erupts through a thick glacier or ice sheet. * Shutter ridges: A shutter ridge is a ridge that has moved along a fault line, blocking or diverting drainage. Typically, a shutter ridge creates a valley corresponding to the alignment of the fault that produces it. * Pressure ridges: Also known as a tumuli, usually develops in lava flows especially when slow-moving lava beneath a solidified crust wells upward.

The small forward is considered to be perhaps the most versatile of the five main basketball positions. In the NBA, small forwards generally range from 6' 6\\" (1.98 m) to 6' 8\\" (2.03 m) without shoes; in the WNBA, they are usually between 5' 10\\" (1.78 m) to 6' 1\\" (1.85 m). Small forwards are responsible for scoring points and defending, and often are secondary or tertiary rebounders behind the power forward and center. In professional basketball, some have considerable passing responsibilities, and many are prolific scorers. The styles with which small forwards score vary widely. Some are very accurate shooters, and some prefer to initiate physical contact with opposing players, while others are primarily slashers who also possess jump shots. In some cases, small forwards position on the baseline; in other cases, they operate as off-ball specialists. The defensive specialists among them are notably versatile, often being able to guard multiple positions using their size, speed, and strength.

They were brought from Siberia to North America by the Thule people 1,000 years ago, along with the Canadian Eskimo Dog that is genetically identical. Today the breed is considered as nationally and culturally important to Greenland and efforts are made to safeguard its purity. In western Greenland north of the Arctic Circle and entire eastern Greenland, it is illegal to import any dog from outside (except for police and assistance dogs with a special permit), and since 2017 all dogs have to be microchipped and registered in the Greenland dog database. In the southwest, such restrictions are not in place and the purity of dogs is not monitored. As the population has been falling ( 15,000 in Greenland as of 2016), a number of projects have been initiated in an attempt of ensuring that Greenland's dog sledding culture, knowledge and use, along with the breed itself, are not lost. Lineage Greenland dog Greenland dog. The first dogs arrived in the Americas 12,000 years ago. However, people and their dogs did not settle in the Arctic until the Paleo-Eskimo people 4,500 years ago and then the Thule people 1,000 years ago, both originating from Siberia. Dogs first appeared in Greenland around 4,000 years ago.Paleoeskimo Dogs of the Eastern Arctic by Darcy F. Morey and Kim Aaris-S√∏rensen. Arctic Vol. 55, No. 1 (Mar., 2002), pp. 44-56. Published by: Arctic Institute of North America.The Greenland sled dog and wolf's genetic origin by Sinding, Mikkel Holger Strander (in Danish). Tidsskriftet Gr√∏nland, 2015, Vol 63, Issue 4, p. 188-191. The Inuit dogs from Canada (Canadian Eskimo Dog) and Greenland (Greenland Dog) descended from dogs associated with Thule people, who relied on them for transportation from Siberia. In 2015, a study using a number of genetic markers indicated that these were both the same dog and should not be treated as separate breeds, that they maintain an indigenous heritage that predates colonization and the timing corresponds with the arrival of the Thule people, and that they were distinct from Siberian Huskies, Alaskan Huskies and Malamutes. The maternal mitochondrial DNA sequences of the Inuit dogs were classified as haplotype A31 that indicates a common female ancestor, and this haplotype could not be found in other modern dogs but the nearest match was with a 1,000 year-old dog from Florida. Nearly all dog breed's genetic closeness to the gray wolf is due to admixture. However, several Arctic dog breeds show a genetic closeness with the now-extinct Taimyr wolf of North Asia due to admixture. These breeds are associated with high latitudes - the Siberian Husky and Greenland Dog that are also associated with Arctic human populations, and to a lesser extent the Shar Pei and Finnish Spitz. An admixture graph of the Greenland dog indicates a best-fit of 3.5% shared material, however an ancestry proportion ranging between 1.4% and 27.3% is consistent with the data. This indicates admixture between the Taymyr wolf population and the ancestral dog population of these 4 high-latitude breeds. This introgression could have provided early dogs living in high latitudes with phenotypic variation beneficial for adaption to a new and challenging environment. It also indicates the ancestry of present-day dog breeds descends from more than one region. In 2020, a genetic study found that Greenland sled dogs have been kept isolated from other breeds since their arrival in Greenland with the Inuit people 850 years ago. Their lineage traces more genomic history than other arctic-breeds to their ancestor's remains which were found on Zhokhov Island, arctic northeastern Siberia and dated to be 9,500 years old.  Description  Appearance The Greenland Dog is a powerful, heavy-built dog. It has a broad, wedge-shaped head, slightly tilted eyes and small, triangular ears covered with thick fur that prevents frostbite. It has strong, muscular, short-haired legs. The tail is usually rolled along/across its back. When it lies down and curls up to rest, the tail often covers the nose. Its coat is of medium length and consists of two layers. The inner layer consists of short wool-like fur, the outer layer of longer, coarser, water-repellent fur. The Greenland Dog comes in all colors, from black to fawn. A characteristic of most Greenland Dogs is the \\"√∫lo\\", a triangular shaped area on the shoulders. It is named after a common woman's-knife from Greenland which is of the same shape. Males are significantly larger than females at between 58 and 68 cm (23‚Äì27 in) at the withers; females are between 51 and 61 cm (20‚Äì24 in). Temperament Puppies eating muskox scraps. Puppies in Greenland run free until they reach adulthood. They are subsequently chained and trained for work. In Greenland this breed exists in much the same condition as it had when originally arriving there, and is kept chiefly as a working dog valued for its strength and speed rather than a malleable temperament. As a result of living in a pack structure, the Greenland dog takes a very firm and confident owner to make a good pet. Once respect is garnered, however, they can be very loyal and protective of their owners, especially if in a pack. Stamina As is common among sled dogs, Greenland Dogs are able to traverse very difficult terrain with ease and with a high tempo. As working dogs they are especially valued for their physical strength and endurance. History An Esquimaux bitch was exhibited at one of the earliest dog shows held in Darlington, Britain on 29 July 1875, which was reported in the Live Stock Journal and Fanciers Gazette published on 6 August 1875. They were recognized by the Kennel Club at its foundation in 1880.The Greenland Dog Club of Great Britain Puppy of Greenland dog The Greenland dog has been a draught animal in the Arctic regions for centuries and consequently they have developed a powerful body and heavy coats, with a natural capacity for load pulling and endurance in a harsh working environment. Roald Amundsen later used Greenland dogs to great success on his 1912 expedition to the Antarctic, where he became the first person to reach the South Pole. Both men started with more dogs than they technically needed to pull the sledges, killing them along the way to use as food for dogs and men.

Life Alfred Weber, younger brother of the well-known sociologist Max Weber, was born in Erfurt and raised in Charlottenburg. From 1907 to 1933, he was a professor at the University of Heidelberg. Work Weber supported reintroducing theory and causal models to the field of economics, in addition to using historical analysis. In this field, his achievements involve work on early models of industrial location. He lived during the period when sociology became a separate field of science. Weber maintained a commitment to the \\"philosophy of history\\" traditions. He contributed theories for analyzing social change in Western civilization as a confluence of civilization (intellectual and technological), social processes (organizations) and culture (art, religion, and philosophy). Least cost theory Leaning heavily on work developed by the relatively unknown Wilhelm Launhardt, Alfred Weber formulated a least cost theory of industrial location which tries to explain and predict the locational pattern of the industry at a macro-scale. It emphasizes that firms seek a site of minimum transport and labor cost. The point for locating an industry that minimizes costs of transportation and labor requires analysis of three factors: Material index The point of optimal transportation is based on the costs of distance to the \\"material index\\" ‚Äì the ratio of weights of the intermediate products (raw materials) to finished product. In one scenario, the weight of the final product is less than the weight of the raw material going into making the product‚Äîthe weight losing industry. For example, in the copper industry, it would be very expensive to haul raw materials to the market for processing, so manufacturing occurs near the raw materials. (Besides mining, other primary activities (or extractive industries) are considered material oriented: timber mills, furniture manufacture, most agricultural activities, etc.. Often located in rural areas, these businesses may employ most of the local population. As they leave, the local area loses its economic base.) In the other, the final product is equally as heavy (Material Index is equal to 1) as the raw materials that require transport. Usually this is a case of some ubiquitous raw material, such as water, being incorporated into the product. This is called the weight-gaining industry. This type of industry tends to build up near market or raw material source, and are called foot-loose industry. Cotton industry is a prominent example of weight-gaining raw material. In some industries, like the heavy chemical industry, the weight of raw materials is less than the weight of the finished product. These industries always grow up near market. Weber's point of optimal transportation is a generalization of the Fermat point problem. In its simplest form, the Fermat problem consists in locating a point D with respect to three points A, B, and C in such a way that the sum of the distances between D and each of the three other points is minimized. As for the Weber triangle problem, it consists in locating a point D with respect to three points A, B, and C in such a way that the sum of the transportation costs between D and each of the three other points is minimized. In 1971, Luc-Normand TellierTellier, Luc- Normand, 1972, \\"The Weber Problem: Solution and Interpretation\\", Geographical Analysis, vol. 4, no. 3, pp. 215‚Äì233. found the first direct (non iterative) numerical solution of the Fermat and Weber triangle problems. Long before Von Th√ºnen's contributions, which go back to 1818, the Fermat point problem can be seen as the very beginning of space economy. It was formulated by the famous French mathematician Pierre de Fermat before 1640. As for the Weber triangle problem, which is a generalization of the Fermat triangle problem, it was first formulated by Thomas Simpson in 1750, and popularized by Alfred Weber in 1909. In 1985, in a book entitled √âconomie spatiale: rationalit√© √©conomique de l'espace habit√©, TellierTellier, Luc-Normand, 1985, √âconomie spatiale: rationalit√© √©conomique de l'espace habit√©, Chicoutimi, Ga√´tan Morin √©diteur, 280 pages. formulated an all-new problem called the \\"attraction-repulsion problem\\", which constitutes a generalization of both the Fermat and Weber problems. In its simplest version, the attraction-repulsion problem consists in locating a point D with respect to three points A1, A2 and R in such a way that the attractive forces exerted by points A1 and A2, and the repulsive force exerted by point R cancel each other out. In the same book, Tellier solved that problem for the first time in the triangle case, and he reinterpreted spatial economics theory, especially, the theory of land rent, in the light of the concepts of attractive and repulsive forces stemming from the attraction-repulsion problem. That problem was later further analyzed by mathematicians like Chen, Hansen, Jaumard and Tuy (1992),Chen, Pey-Chun, Hansen, Pierre, Jaumard, Brigitte, and Hoang Tuy, 1992, \\"Weber's Problem with Attraction and Repulsion,\\" Journal of Regional Science 32, 467‚Äì486. and Jalal and Krarup (2003).Jalal, G., & Krarup, J. (2003). \\"Geometrical solution to the Fermat problem with arbitrary weights\\". Annals of Operations Research, 123, 67{104. The attraction-repulsion problem is seen by Ottaviano and Thisse (2005)Ottaviano, Gianmarco and Jacques-Fran√ßois Thisse, 2005, \\"New Economic Geography: what about the N?\\", Environment and Planning A 37, 1707‚Äì1725. as a prelude to the New Economic Geography that developed in the 1990s, and earned Paul Krugman a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008. Agglomeration and deagglomeration Agglomeration is the phenomenon of spatial clustering, or a concentration of firms in a relatively small area. The clustering and linkages allow individual firms to enjoy both internal and external economies. Auxiliary industries, specialized machines or services used only occasionally by larger firms, tend to be located in agglomeration areas, not just to lower costs but to serve the bigger populations. Deglomeration occurs when companies and services leave because of the diseconomies of industries‚Äô excessive concentration. Firms who can achieve economies by increasing their scale of industrial activities benefit from agglomeration. However, after reaching an optimal size, local facilities may become over-taxed, lead to an offset of initial advantages and increase in PC. Then the force of agglomeration may eventually be replaced by other forces which promote deglomeration. Globalization Similarly, industrial activity is considered a secondary economic activity, and is also discussed as manufacturing. Industrial activity can be broken down further to include the following activities: processing, the creation of intermediate parts, final assembly. Today with multinational corporations, the three activities listed above may occur outside MDCs. Weber's theory can explain some of the causes for current movement, yet such discussion did not come from Weber himself. Weber found industrial activity the least expensive to produce. Least cost location then implies marketing the product at the least cost to the consumer, much like retailers attempt to obtain large market shares today. Economically, it is explained as one way to make a profit; creating the cheapest product for the consumer market leads to greater volume of sales and hence, greater profits. Therefore, companies that do not take the time to locate the cheapest inputs or the largest markets would not succeed, since their product costs more to produce and costs the consumer more. His theory has five assumptions. His first assumption is known as the isotropic plain assumption. This means the model is operative in a single country with a uniform topography, climate, technology, economic system. His second assumption is that only one finished product is considered at a time, and the product is shipped to a single market. The third assumption is raw materials are fixed at certain locations, and the market is also a known fixed location. The fourth assumption is labor is fixed geographically but is available in unlimited quantities at any production site selected. The final assumption is that transport costs are a direct function of weight of the item and the distance shipped. In use with his theory he created the locational triangle. His triangle is used with one market and two sources of material. This illustrated that manufacturing that utilizes pure materials will never tie the processing location to the material site. Also industries utilizing high weight loss materials will tend to be pulled toward the material source as opposed to the market. Furthermore, many industries will select an intermediate location between market and material. The last generalization is considered to be wrong because he never takes into account terminal costs and therefore is considered biased toward intermediate locations. To further explore the location of firms Weber also created two concepts. The first is of an isotim, which is a line of equal transport cost for any product or material. The second is the isodapane which is a line of total transport costs. The isodapane is found by adding all of the isotims at a location. The reason for using isodapanes is to systematically introduce the labor component into Weber's locational theory. Weber has received much criticism. It has been said that Weber did not effectively and realistically take into account geographic variation in market demand, which is considered a locational factor of paramount influence. Also his treatment of transport did not recognize that these costs are not proportional to distance and weight, and that intermediate locations necessitate added terminal charges. Labor is not always available in unlimited quantity at any location and is usually quite mobile through migration. Plus most manufacturing plants obtain a large number of material inputs and produce a wide range of products for many diverse markets, so his theory doesn't easily apply. Furthermore, he underestimated the effect of agglomeration.

The tower was built between 1960 and 1968 on the site where the All-India Muslim League passed the Lahore Resolution on 23 March 1940 - the first official call for a separate and independent homeland for the Muslims of British India, as espoused by the two-nation theory. The resolution eventually helped lead to the emergence of an independent Pakistani state in 1947. Design The tower reflects a blend of Mughal/Islamic and modern architecture. The tower was designed and supervised by, Nasreddin Murat-Khan a Russian-born Pakistani architect and civil engineer. The foundation stone was laid on 23 March 1960. Construction took eight years, and was completed on 21 October 1968 at an estimated cost of Rs 7,058,000. The money was collected by imposing an additional tax on cinema and horse racing tickets at the demand of Akhtar Hussain, governor of West Pakistan. Today, the minaret provides a panoramic view to visitors who can't climb up the stairs or access the top, by means of an elevator. The parks around the monument include marble fountains and an artificial lake.  Structure  The monument sits atop a plinth The base is about 8 metres above the ground. The tower rises about 62 metres on the base, the total height of the minar is about 70 metres above the ground. The unfolding petals of the flower-like base are 9 metres high. The diameter of the tower is about 9.75 meters. The rostrum is built of patterned tiles, and faces Badshahi Mosque. The base comprises four platforms. To symbolise the humble beginning of the freedom struggle, first platform is built with uncut stones from Taxila, second platform is made of hammer-dressed stones, whereas third platform is of chiselled stones.

Created by Robert Kanigher and Nick Cardy, Lilith made her first appearance in Teen Titans #25 (February 1970) and commonly appears as a member of the Teen Titans. She is depicted as the best friend of Donna Troy (the first Wonder Girl) and the second hero to join the original Teen Titans after its founders, following Roy Harper (the first Speedy). Although her origin and powers have varied significantly throughout her history, she is consistently seen as both precognitive and psychic. Fictional character biography Pre-Crisis Originally living in peace at home, Lilith started to manifest strange mental powers at the age of 13. She read her parents' minds to find she was adopted, then left home to try to find her birth parents. After some trouble, she ended up working as a dancer at the Canary Cottage disco. During this time, she encountered Loren Jupiter, and began to aid him in his cause.Teen Titans #25 Soon, Lilith approached the Teen Titans and asked to join. She saw premonitions involving a political figure, who inevitably died, proving her power. She then became a member of the Teen Titans. Once joining the team after her first appearance (Teen Titans #25, first series), she would remain with the team for the remainder of its original run (through Teen Titans #43, first series), as well as guest starring both with and without the team in other DC titles: The Brave and the Bold #94 (in which she is directly responsible for preventing a bombing in Gotham City), Batman #'s 241‚Äì242, and World's Finest Comics #205. Eventually, she left the team and resettled on the West Coast, where she started a new branch of the Titans (known as Titans West). She briefly dated one of her team members, Don Hall (Dove) before leaving him to begin a relationship with the caveman Gnarrk. Prior to the disbanding of the original Teen Titans and their Titans West counterpart group, Lilith revealed that she had a vision of her teammate Donna Troy (Wonder Girl) marrying a red headed man, who is horrifically murdered along with their child. At the time, Donna was dating her teammate (and red head) Roy Harper. Fearing Lilith's prophecy, Donna broke up with Roy. Lilith rejoined the team following a reunion with her teammates for the wedding of Donna Troy and Terry Long (who Lilith's prophecy ended up actually referencing). She mentioned that something terrible had happened to Gnarrk, who was not with her at the wedding but would not elaborate. She soon began to be stalked by a mysterious winged creature called Azrael, who sought to make her his mate. However, every time he came near Lilith, she glowed with a previously unseen power. Her fellow Titans blamed Azrael for hurting her and attacked him every chance they got. After revealing to her teammates that she had similar \\"heat attacks\\" long before Azrael appeared, she resigned from the Titans in anger. During the Terror of Trigon storyline (New Teen Titans, Vol. 2 #1‚Äì6), Lilith returned to the team as she had become secretly possessed by Azar and sought to get the Titans to help tracking down Raven, who had gone missing. During this adventure, the possessed Lilith arranged the merger of the souls of the residents of Azarath in a successful attempt to cleanse Raven of evil. Lilith rejoined the team following this adventure, but after Azrael returned, Lilith began manifesting flame-like powers. This was enough to alert Lilith's birth mother, Thia, of her daughter's location. Thia kidnapped Lilith and revealed the truth about her past: Thia had escaped Tartarus, the prison of the Titans of Myth, and began wandering the Earth. She went mad, seducing and murdering wealthy and powerful men in order to gain their wealth and power, as well as spawn many children to do her bidding. Lilith's father was the owner of Sun Publishing, and on their wedding night, Thia burned him alive after Lilith was conceived. After taking over her late husband's company, Thia turned Lilith over to a nurse for care, and the nurse kidnapped her. The Titans, along with the Amazons, Greek Gods, and the other Titans of Myth, freed Lilith and defeated Thia, who had launched a brutal assault on Olympus and those who followed the Greek Gods. During the battle, Thia's brother and husband, Hyperion sacrificed his life to kill Thia. Afterword, Lilith was offered demigod status by Zeus and a place on Olympus, which she accepted. Post-Crisis After the Crisis on Infinite Earths, Lilith was not heard from for a time; however, the mythological Titans (including Thia) showed up in New Titans #50‚Äì54 as a benevolent pantheon and adoptive parents of Donna Troy. This storyline effectively negated Lilith's origin.New Titans #50‚Äì54 Lilith's first post-crisis appearance was a flashback story published in New Titans #56 which detailed the original Titans first encounter with Gnarrk. Her first proper appearance was in the War of the Gods storyline, allying with the Titans and providing help for them during the crossover. =Omen= The character would disappear again until 1996, with the launch of Dan Jurgens' Teen Titans. At the start of the series, Jurgens had a masked figure named Omen gather the team for Mr Jupiter, who once again was financially backing the Teen Titans. The character was originally intended to be Raven, but an embargo was placed upon the cast of the New Teen Titans appearing in the title by editorial. As such, Lilith was substituted as the secret identity of Omen. In Teen Titans #12‚Äì15, Omen is unmasked as Lilith after being captured by the super-villain Haze. During the story, Lilith summons both the founding Titans (sans Donna Troy, who was imprisoned by Dark Angel at the time) and the Jurgens Titans to rescue her. The original Titans recognized Haze as a villain they fought once before in the past, but when Haze unmasked Omen before the two teams and shattered the illusion spell Omen used to hide her identity, she was revealed as Lilith. Lilith was revealed to be Mr Jupiter's illegitimate daughter and Haze, Mr Jupiter's son from a previous marriage. Mr Jupiter wife had ran off with their son Jarrod (Haze) and years later Loren Jupiter met Lilith's mother. Teen Titans v2 15 Haze blamed Lilith for his father abandoning him and his mother to poverty, and sought to use her as a pawn to destroy their father and the Titans. Haze was defeated and Lilith remained with the group for the rest of its run. As Omen, Lilith now possessed telekinetic power and illusion casting powers. It was also established that, like her brother, Lilith suffers from mental illness: due to her not being able to tune out other peoples thoughts, Lilith periodically suffers from episodes of amnesia and disassociation from her sense of self. She aided the Titans in protecting former team-mate Cyborg's soul from the Justice League in the JLA/Titans: The Technis Imperative mini-series. Shortly after that, Lilith was abducted by Vandal Savage, who wanted her to divine a perfect team to take down the Titans. Savage forced Lilith to submit, but she purposely chose members who wouldn't work well as a team. She was rescued by the reformed Titans.Titans #14 Lilith stood with her old friends when a mysterious corporation called Optitron approached the Titans and Young Justice with an offer to fund the two groups. Before they could discuss the offer, the teams were attacked by an android from the future called Indigo. The malfunctioning robot accidentally activated a Superman android believed to be long destroyed. The rampaging Superman Android managed to both snap Lilith's neck and pierce Donna Troy's heart, and while Donna was revealed to still be alive on another world, Lilith was killed. This tragedy, told in Titans/Young Justice: Graduation Day, led team leader Nightwing to disband the two groups, although they would be reformed shortly thereafter as the Outsiders and the latest incarnation of the Teen Titans. Lilith appeared in Teen Titans (vol. 3) #30, as her soul was resurrected by the newest Brother Blood as the latest in his doomed line of mother-figures.Teen Titans #29 Despite the request of Speedy, Kid Eternity did not allow her to stay among the living.Teen Titans #31 A statue of Lilith is in the Memorial of the Titans Tower in San Francisco.Teen Titans #3 In Blackest Night: Titans crossover, Lilith was reanimated as a member of the Black Lantern Corps, ready to attack the Titans.Blackest Night: Titans #1 However, her body is soon destroyed by a burst of white light emanating from Dawn Granger.Blackest Night: Titans #3 Lilith was recently seen in a flashback of Donna Troy's. During their early years, Donna and Roy Harper were dating, and apparently Roy had intended to propose to Donna. However, Lilith informed Donna of a prophecy in which a red haired man who loved Donna and became her husband would die. Thinking the prophecy meant Roy, Donna rejected the proposal. Lilith's prophecy however turned out to be true in regards to Donna's now deceased husband Terry. The New 52 In this new timeline, a passing reference to Lilith is first introduced in Red Hood and the Outlaws as being part of a team with Cyborg, Garth a.k.a. Aqualad, Richard, Garfield and a new unseen character named Dustin, as superhero companions that Starfire seemingly no longer remembers.Red Hood and the Outlaws Vol.1 #1 Between her being mentioned in Red Hood and the Outlaws #1 and Titans Hunt #1, DC introduced a character named Omen that Skitter referred to as Lilith. Omen was a telepath that worked for Harvest and N.O.W.H.E.R.E. and in particular, the bloodsport event known as \\"The Culling\\", where teen captives of N.O.W.H.E.R.E. were forced to fight to the death. Omen was blonde and had her eyes sewn shut; she could create illusions with her psychic powers and control peoples thoughts. This made her a valuable member of N.O.W.H.E.R.E., as she enforced Harvest's will amongst his henchmen and prisoners, conditioning and preparing them for the Culling. Omen reappears in Teen Titans Annual #3. She appears reformed and her eyes are no longer sewn shut. Harvest tries absorbing her powers as well as those of the other Colony‚Äôs metahumans into a single weapon only for the Titans to defeat him by blowing up the Colony, sparing Lilith and all the other metahumans present. With Titans Hunt restoring the original version of the character, the New 52 Omen is now a separate character from Lilith. DC Rebirth Lilith later appears in Titans Hunt #1, as a drug counselor who has been secretly keeping tabs on Roy Harper, Donna Troy, Dick Grayson, Mal Duncan and his wife Karen Beecher, Hank Hall, and the caveman hero Gnarrk. It is revealed that along with Lilith, the heroes were the original Teen Titans. The group fell victim to the villain Mr Twister, who ensnarled them into an occult ritual that threatened the world. The only way to stop the ritual involved erasing all memories the group had of their existence and of each other, which was performed by Lilith. When Mr Twister resurfaced and restored their memories, Lilith began attempting to gather the Titans together to stop their enemy once and for all.Titans Hunt #1‚Äì6 Lilith Clay goes by the name Omen in the DC Rebirth comics. She was in the team called Titans, which is composed of former Teen Titans members who are now grown up with Nightwing, Donna Troy, Arsenal, Tempest, and the Wally West version of Flash. When the Speed Force restores the Titan's memories of Wally West, it is shown that Wally and Lilith used to be in a romantic relationship.Titans: Rebirth #1 Lilith left to pursue a relationship while the team disband shortly afterwards Powers Lilith Clay's powers have not been entirely explored in the comics due to the heightened nature of her powers as Omen, however all versions of Lilith are both prescient and psychic. It is understood that she has certain mental abilities, such as telepathy, death sense, and precognition. As Omen, she was able to tap into certain divine, or mystical, powers. She is specifically shown to use pyrokinesis, teleport, maintain complex illusions and project psionic power blasts. It is also strongly implied that she recalls the world before Crisis on Infinite Earths, a trait she uniquely shares with the villainous Psycho-Pirate. In DC Rebirth she is aware of a one-word clue to the identity of the being that created the New 52: \\"Manhattan\\". As of DC Rebirth, Lilith has been described as an \\"Alpha-Class psionic\\" and has demonstrated mental powers that easily rival, if not surpass those of the villainous telepath Psimon. Her powers often manifest as a visible green aura of light that outlines her sphere of influence. She has displayed a breadth of psychic abilities including mind-reading, psionic cloaking, precognition, projecting psychic attacks and psionic blasts as well as enough telekinetic precision to create an invisible layer of armor around herself. During her time as a member of K.N.O.W.H.E.R.E., she would torture prisoners by creating terrifying illusions and telepathically amplifying their fears and anxieties.

The region's capital is Piura and its largest port cities, Paita and Talara, are also among the most important in Peru. The area is known for its tropical and dry beaches. It is the most populous department in Peru, its twelfth smallest department, and its fourth-most densely populated department, after Tumbes, La Libertad, and Lambayeque. The country's latest decentralization program is in hiatus after the proposal to merge departments was defeated in the national referendum in October 2005.US State department at www.state.gov July 2007 \\"Background Note: Peru\\" The referendum held on October 30, 2005, as part of the ongoing decentralization process in Peru, to decide whether the region would merge with the current regions of Lambayeque and Tumbes to create a new Regi√≥n Norte was defeated. Geography The Piura Region is bordered to the north by the Tumbes Region and Ecuador, to the east by Cajamarca Region, to the south by the Lambayeque Region, and to the west by the Pacific Ocean. \\"Punta Pari√±as\\" in Piura is South America's most western point. The territory of the Piura Region has many climate variations due to its geographical location. It is just 4 degrees south of the equator, yet receives two ocean currents at the same time: the cold Humboldt Current (13‚Äì20 ¬∞C 55‚Äì68 ¬∞F) and the warm El Ni√±o Current (20‚Äì27 ¬∞C, 68‚Äì80 ¬∞F). This makes the Piura Region a land that is both tropical and arid at the same time, The Land where the Tropics meets The Desert The coast is divided by the Peruvian subtropical desert of Sechura on the south and savanna-like scrub Tumbes-Piura dry forests to the center and north of the region. There are also small valleys of tropical climate, where rice and coconut fields are common, especially around the Piura and Sullana rivers. There is a high Amazon climate (selva alta) as one goes away from the coast onto the sierra; P√°ramo climates and cooler temperatures appear as one climbs the sierra. Topography is smooth in the coast and rough in the Sierra. There are many arid plains in the southern region. The Sechura Desert, located south of the Piura River, is Peru's largest desert and one of the world's few examples of a tropical desert; it borders a tropical terrain to the north. The Bay√≥var Depression, which is the lowest point in Peru and all of the Southern Tropics, is located in this desert. The morphological forms most common in the coast are the dry ravine that suddenly become copious when there are heavy rains, forming tropical dry forests all over. Other features are half-moon shaped dunes, the marine terraces such as those of M√°ncora, Talara and Lobitos. Valleys have been formed by fluvial terraces of the Chira River and Piura River. To the east, valleys are more or less deep and have been eroded by rivers forming equatorial tropical-dry-forests. The major peak surpasses 3000 m. The Paso de Porculla, in the southwest of the territory is only 2,138 meters high and is the lowest pass of the Peruvian Andes. The rivers crossing its territory belong both to the Pacific watershed and to the Amazon Basin. The Chira River is the most important and flows into the Pacific Ocean. The Piura River also flows into the Pacific Ocean although the flow varies greatly with the changing seasons and during severe droughts will dry up. Climate Santo Domingo (Morrop√≥n). The climate is subtropical and tropical savanna in the center and north coast, Semi-arid in the southern coast near Lambayeque Region. Piura has a tropical dry or tropical savanna climate monsoon weather that averages 26 ¬∞C (79 ¬∞F) throughout the whole year. Pleasant warm winters (May to October) that average between 25 ¬∞C and 28 ¬∞C (77 ¬∞F and 82 ¬∞F) during the daytime and lows around 16 ¬∞C (61 ¬∞F) during the night. Piura is covered by deserts, tropical valleys, dry equatorial forests, high Amazon climates as you reach between 1000 and 1500 meters, and a humid subtropical sierra climate if you reach over 2,000 meters. The P√°ramo climate is found in the higher regions of the Sierra. Rain is scarce from May to November: it rains only from December to April at discontinuous rates due to the influence of the El Ni√±o Current, but every so often, when the El Ni√±o phenomenon arrives, rain is copious and makes the dry ravines become alive, giving rise not only to the impressive forests but to many floods and great landslides. El Ni√±o occurs when ocean waters reach 27 ¬∞C (80 ¬∞F). When ocean water temperatures elevate 1 or 1.5 degrees Celsius higher than 26 ¬∞C (79 ¬∞F), the consequence could be catastrophic rains. Although ocean waters can drop to 19 ¬∞C (66 ¬∞F) during the dry winter months (May to October), they can also rise to 27 ¬∞C (80 ¬∞F) during the humid summer months (December to April); this calls for pleasant rains; yet if the temperatures rise 1 or 1.5 ¬∞C degrees above that, El Ni√±o is assured. During summer (December to April), temperatures can reach over 40 ¬∞C (104 ¬∞F) inland. During night time, 30s or even high 20s may seem unpleasant, which urge people to go to beach resorts such as M√°ncora or Col√°n. The rest of the months have pleasant summer temperatures in the low 30s and mid 20s ¬∞C (77‚Äì90 ¬∞F). Natural resources and wildlife Piura is a land of unique algarrobo trees, a variety of mesquite similar to the carob, and it is the region with the most equatorial tropical dry forests in the whole Pacific. These ecoregions carry a unique variety of orchids, birds, reptiles, plants and mammals. Piura is known for the best and oldest lime-lemons in South America as well as South America's finest mango (tropical dry). With Lambayeque, it is the original home of Pima cotton. Piura also produces bananas, coconuts, rice and other fruits as local income. The \\"Manglares de Vice\\" in the Sechura Province of Piura is the southernmost region of the Pacific to hold mangroves. Its development has been favoured also by the petroleum found in the ocean of Talara Province, fishing is blessed by two ocean currents, silver mines are common and the current Bayovar Deposits are present as well. History Plaza de Armas of Piura. The most important culture that developed in the Piura region was Vic√∫s, which stood out for its ceramics and delicate work in gold. The Tallanes or Yungas, however, were the first settlers, who migrated from the Sierra. During a period that is still vague, they lived in behetrias, which were primitive settlements without a head or an organization. Later they were conquered by the Mochicas and, centuries later, by the Incas, during the rule of Tupac Inca Yupanqui. In 1532, Francisco Pizarro founded the first Spanish city in South America on the banks of the Chira River in the Tangarar√° Valley. He named it San Miguel de Piura. The founding date is still subject of controversy. However, during the 450th anniversary celebrations, July 15 was adopted as the official date. In 1534, due to a lack of sanitary conditions, the capital was moved to Monte de los Padres (Morrop√≥n); in 1578, and for the same reason, it was moved again, this time to San Francisco de la Buena Esperanza (Paita). In 1588, the permanent attacks of the English pirates and privateers forced a final relocation of the capital to Piura. During colonial times, life went by peacefully. Yet, the raids against the Spanish authorities led by Admirals Borran and Cochrane, members of the libertarian expedition of Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, woke the longing for liberty in the minds of the local people. Culture and customs of Piura Clarito served in a bowl known as \\"poto\\". Catacaos, Peru. Piura is host to a stunning mestizo culture, since all races mix here. Local Piuranos have a different accent from their neighbours at both sides since: they tend elongate their syllables in a similar ways to northern Mexicans. Piuranos have their own proud slang. Locals for example, call themselves Churres (popular term used for a young Piuran or northern person). Piuranos are characterized by their witty minds, melancolic Tondero music and welcoming personalities. Like many Peruvians, they enjoy drinking chicha de jora, pisco or beer and many of them have a tendency towards creativity and art as their source of income. Local gastronomical dishes include the Piuran Secho de Chavelo (the capital's dish), Algarrobina cocktails, many types of ceviches and other seafoods like Majarisco and Pasao al Agua. Piura is famed for its natilla sweets as well. The warm climate of this region forbids hard labour from 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m., so it is common tradition to take siestas and better to wake up early to get important stuff done before noon. Processions and religious folk are passionately practiced by some of the locals. One of them is Cristo de Ayabaca. Popular crafts are the Chulucana Pottery and handy hats and silversmith arts made from the Catacaos Province. Northern cowboys can still be seen today wandering the deserts of Sechura, Catacaos and the forests of Morropon transporting their goods using donkeys and mules. They seem to resemble physically the \\"American Southwest\\" cowboys, or Argentinian gauchos and Mexican charros. They are noted not only for their abilities to sing and play Cumanana and Tondero but as silversmiths that work the filigree earrings, leathers, hats, wooden and silver utensils of Catacaos region. Music The Tondero and Cumanana are the traditional music of the Piura Region. The great exponents of these passionate rhythms are the cowboys called piajenos. Apparently they point to have a Roma, or Gypsy, origin. Chicha music, now called Tecnocumbia (originally a Peruvian styled cumbia with electronic elements), is the modern version of popular music all over, as well as Salsa among youngsters. Another great tradition that is sung by all northern Peruvians is the famous Peruvian Waltz, well practiced by traditional musicians (northern Peruvians have their style).

A bike path is a bikeway separated from motorized traffic and dedicated to cycling or shared with pedestrians or other non-motorized users. In the US a bike path sometimes encompasses shared use paths, \\"multi-use path\\", or \\"Class III bikeway\\" is a paved path that has been designated for use by cyclists outside the right of way of a public road. It may or may not have a center divider or stripe to prevent head-on collisions. In the UK, a shared-use footway or multi-use path is for use by both cyclists and pedestrians.  Bike paths with independent rights-of-way Bike paths that follow independent rights-of-way are often used to promote recreational cycling. In Northern European countries, cycling tourism represents a significant proportion of overall tourist activity. Extensive interurban bike path networks can be found in countries such as Denmark or the Netherlands, which has had a national system of cycle routes since 1993. These networks may use routes dedicated exclusively to cycle traffic or minor rural roads whose use is otherwise restricted to local motor traffic and agricultural machinery. The Fietspad or Bicycle Path in the Netherlands is logically constructed to link shops, housing, stations, schools, workplaces for everyday cycling. This Fietspad or Bicycle Path is in the Netherlands safely linking housing. The more sensible approach is based on efforts to increase Utility cycling. In countries like Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany the high levels of utility cycling also includes shopping trips e.g. 9% of all shopping trips in Germany are by bicycle.Shopping by bike, BUND Freunde der erde, Landesverband Berlin e.V (Accessed 28 October 2007) The UK has recently implemented the National Cycle Network. Where available, these routes are often rail trails making use of abandoned railway corridors. A prominent example in the UK is the Bristol & Bath Railway Path, a path for walkers and cyclists that is part of National Cycle Route 4. Other UK examples include The Ebury Way Cycle Path, The Alban Way, the Hillend Loch Railway Path and the Nicky Line. In 2003 the longest continuous bike path in Europe was opened, along the Albacete-Valdeganga highway in Spain, a distance of . Bogota's Bike Paths Network (Ciclorutas de Bogot√° in Spanish), designed and built during the administration of Mayor Enrique Pe√±alosa attracts significant recreational use. The relative safety of bike paths that follow independent rights-of-way closed to motorized traffic is difficult to assess. In terms of car/bicycle collisions, this is clearly mediated by how the bike path network rejoins the main road network. In the English town of Milton Keynes, a study showed that cyclists using the off-road Milton Keynes redway system had on a per journey basis a significantly higher rate of fatal car-bicycle collisions at path/roadway crossings than cyclists on ordinary roads.Two decades of the Redway cycle paths of Milton Keynes, J. Franklin (Cycling Skills and Safety Consultant), Traffic Engineering and Control, pp. 393‚Äì396, July/August 1999 This safety can be altered substantially by design. For example, the Dutch Simultaneous Green Junction design has a nearly flawless record when it comes to accommodating cyclists at traffic light junctions. The consequences of other risks ‚Äî falls, cyclist‚Äìcyclist collisions and cyclist‚Äìpedestrian collisions ‚Äî are frequently not recorded in official accident figures and may be available only via local hospital surveys. As a general rule, those bike paths with the highest perceived safety tend to be those engineered on the assumption of vehicular rather than pedestrian traffic.

Most of the department is located in the upper part of the Peruvian Amazon rainforest. Its capital is Moyobamba and the largest city in the department is Tarapoto. Geography Boundaries * North and East: Loreto Region * South: Hu√°nuco Region * West: La Libertad and Amazonas regions Morphology The territory of San Mart√≠n can be divided into four morphological zones: * the west, near the eastern side of the Andean Plateau, with a rough topography and many ravines; * the zone of the wide valleys, with stepped terraces formed by the Huallaga River and its affluents, where population is engaged mainly in cattle and agriculture; * the southwest zone, with a relief coming down from the Cordillera Azul, with low elevation, where is an impressive canyon known as Caj√≥n de Si√≥n, which finishes in the Cayumba rapids; * a small lower jungle zone with areas easily flooded and with almost no accidents. The Huallaga River is one of the most important rivers in the region. It forms, together with its tributaries a hydrographical system which drains all of the region's territory. The Pongo de Aguirre is an important canyon formed by the Huallaga going through the Andean hills. History Tupac Yupanqui entered and subdued the Inca dominion, the province of Moyobamba, known back then by its native name, Muyupampa. In 1539, Spaniard Alonso de Alvarado reached the Mayo River and founded a city he named Santiago de los Valles de Moyobamba, which later became the capital of Maynas. Another important personality was Priest Manuel Sobreviela who, between 1787 and 1790, accomplished traveling across the Huallaga River and subsequently published a map named \\"Planning for the course of the Huallaga and Ucayali Rivers and for the Pampa del Sacramento\\". On August 19, 1821, Moyobamba was the first Peruvian city in declaring its independence. The construction of a highway in recent years has increased the exchange of different products, benefitting the economy of this region. Political division Map of the San Mart√≠n region showing its provinces The region is divided into 10 provinces (, singular: ), which are composed of 77 districts (distritos, singular: distrito). The provinces, with their capitals in parenthesis, are: * Bellavista (Bellavista) * El Dorado (San Jos√© de Sisa) * Huallaga (Saposoa) * Lamas (Lamas) * Mariscal C√°ceres (Juanju√≠) * Moyobamba (Moyobamba) * Picota (Picota) * Rioja (Rioja) * San Mart√≠n (Tarapoto) * Tocache (Tocache) Archaeology Gran Paj√°ten is a pre Inca complex of circular slate buildings decorated with figures of flying condors situated on the border with La Libertad.

Cordovan is an equine leather made from the fibrous flat connective tissue (or shell) beneath the hide on the rump of the horse. The leather derives its name from the city of Cordoba, Spain, where it was first produced by the Visigoths in the seventh century, and later also by the Moors. It is a difficult and expensive leather to make, and in the late 19th and early 20th century was mostly used for razor strops to sharpen razors in barber shops. More recently it has been increasingly used for shoes, wallets, and watch straps due to its aesthetic qualities and exceptional durability. Shell cordovan has a unique non-creasing characteristic. Because it is made of connective tissue, it is smooth and lacks the pebbled effect of leather derived from animal skin. Production After removal from the horse, the hide is measured from the root of the tail 18 inches forward on the backbone. The hide is cut at right angles to the backbone and the resulting pieces termed a \\"front\\" (the forward part) and the \\"butt\\". The term cordovan leather applies to the product of both the tanned fronts and tanned butts, but is especially used in connection with the term galoshes, meaning the vamps or boot-fronts cut from the shell of the butt. After being tanned, leather from the \\"front\\" is typically used in the fabrication of gloves, or blackened, to be used in the tops of shoes. The \\"butt\\", after tanning, is passed through a splitting-machine which removes the grain, or hair side, revealing what is termed the \\"shell\\". The close fibers of the shell result in a smooth and pliable leather used almost exclusively in the manufacture of shoes and watch straps, although another use is for the manufacture of finger protection tabs for archery, where it is prized for its toughness, longevity, and protective qualities. Due to the difficulty in applying dyes, shell cordovan is available in a narrow range of colors.Shoe leather options heddels.com October 2014 References External links * Shell cordovan making Leathermaking Leather ","title":"Shell cordovan"},{"id":"715007","text":"Ali ªi≈çlani Hale is a building located in downtown Honolulu, Hawai ªi, currently used as the home of the Hawai ªi State Supreme Court. It is the former seat of government of the Kingdom of Hawai ªi and the Republic of Hawai ªi. Located in the building's courtyard is the famed gold-leaf statue of Kamehameha the Great.  Design and history  The Ali ªi≈çlani Hale was designed by Australian Thomas Rowe in an Italian Renaissance Revival as the royal palace for King Kamehameha V. In the Hawaiian language, Ali ªi≈çlani Hale means \\"House of Heavenly Kings\\". The name \\"Ali ªi≈çlani\\" was also one of the given names of Kamehameha V. Although the building was designed to be a palace, Kamehameha V realized that the Hawaiian government desperately needed a government building. At that time, the several buildings in Honolulu used by the government were very small and cramped, clearly inadequate for the growing Hawaiian government. Thus, when Kamehameha V ordered construction of Ali ªi≈çlani Hale, he commissioned it as a government office building instead of a palace. Kamehameha V laid the cornerstone for the building on February 19, 1872. He died before the building was completed, and it was dedicated in 1874 by one of his successors, King David KalƒÅkaua. At the time, Hawaiian media criticized the building's extravagant design, suggesting that the building be converted into a palace as originally designed. Until 1893, the building held most of the executive departments of the Hawaiian government as well as the Hawaiian legislature and courts.  Overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy  It was from Ali ªi≈çlani Hale in 1893 that the Committee of Safety, under the leadership of Lorrin A. Thurston, deposed Queen Lili ªuokalani by public proclamation. After the establishment of the Hawaiian provisional government in 1893 and the Republic of Hawai ªi in 1894, some of the offices in Ali ªi≈çlani Hale were moved to  ªIolani Palace, including the Hawaiian legislature. As a result, Ali ªiolani Hale became primarily a judicial building.  Ali ªi≈çlani Hale since 1900  Kamehameha Statue The growing size of Hawai ªi's government continued to be a problem for the building, however, especially after Hawai ªi became a United States territory in 1900. In 1911, the building was extensively renovated to help solve these space problems. The entire interior of the building was gutted and rebuilt, giving the building's interior a completely new floorplan. Since the building was originally designed to be a palace, its floorplan was not adequate for its later usage as a judicial building. The new layout of the building fixed this problem. The size of the territorial government continued to grow. In the 1940s, a new wing was added to the building to help alleviate the growing problem of overcrowding. The architects who designed the new wing tried to blend it in with the original building that dated back to the 1870s. Over the next many decades, most of the state judiciary functions moved out of Ali ªi≈çlani Hale to various other buildings around Honolulu (including the state district, family, and circuit courts). Today, the building houses the Hawai ªi State Supreme Court and is the administrative center of the Hawai ªi State Judiciary. It also houses the Judiciary History Center, a museum featuring a multimedia presentation of Hawai ªi's judiciary, a restored historic courtroom, and other exhibits dealing with Hawai ªi's judicial history. The building also houses Hawai ªi's largest law library. In December 2005, a capsule buried by Kamehameha V when he laid the cornerstone was located, at the direction of the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command, by Professor Larry Connors of the University of Denver using ground penetrating radar. The capsule contained photos of royal families and the constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom, Hawaiian postage stamps, Hawaiian and foreign coinage, newspapers, a calendar and books. The capsule was located to protect it during future renovations, and not retrieved due to concerns of damaging the structure of the building itself. Copper thieves stripped several copper downspouts from the building in 2006. In the 2010 version of CBS' Hawaii Five-0 TV series, Ali ªi≈çlani Hale is depicted as the Iolani Palace; headquarters for the Five-0 task force with exterior shots of the building being used frequently throughout the series. Ali ªi≈çlani Hale is one of many buildings in downtown Honolulu listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Within walking distance are the Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace, Hawai ªi State Capitol, Hawai ªi State Library, Honolulu Hale,  ªIolani Palace, Kawaiaha ªo Church, Territorial Building, and Washington Place.  King Kamehameha V Judiciary History Center  The King Kamehameha V Judiciary History Center, located in Ali ªi≈çlani Hale, focuses on Hawaii's legal history and landmark court cases.

Created by Marv Wolfman and George P√©rez, the character debuted in The New Teen Titans #2 in December 1980. He is usually depicted as an assassin and the archenemy of the Teen Titans, specifically Dick Grayson; he has also served as an adversary of other heroes in the DC Universe, such as Batman, Green Arrow, and the Justice League. He is the father of Joe, Rose and Grant Wilson. The character was ranked as the 24th Greatest Villain of All Time by Wizard magazine and as the 32nd Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time by IGN.Wizard #177 He has been substantially adapted into various forms of media, including several Batman- related projects, mainly the Batman: Arkham video game franchise, in which he is voiced by Mark Rolston and the Teen Titans animated series, in which he is voiced by Ron Perlman. In live-action, Deathstroke has been portrayed by Manu Bennett on The CW's television show Arrow, by Esai Morales on the DC Universe series Titans, and by Joe Manganiello in the DC Extended Universe, beginning with a cameo in the 2017 film Justice League. Publication history \\"Deathstroke the Terminator\\" was created by Marv Wolfman and George P√©rez, and made his first appearance in The New Teen Titans #2 in December 1980. Christopher J. Priest said: Due to his popularity, Deathstroke received his own series, Deathstroke the Terminator, in 1991. It was retitled Deathstroke the Hunted for issues #0 and #41‚Äì45; and then simply Deathstroke for issues #46‚Äì60. The series was cancelled with issue #60. In total, Deathstroke ran for 65 issues (#1‚Äì60, plus four Annuals and a special #0 issue). Following his injury in DC Universe: Last Will and Testament, Deathstroke appears in one of the four Faces of Evil one-shots, written by David Hine. Hine has explained that the series is part of the set-up for future stories: \\"All of the characters in this ‚ÄòFaces of Evil‚Äô series were selected for their potential as major players in the coming year.\\" Even though the character of Deathstroke the Terminator predates James Cameron's film The Terminator by four years, the Slade Wilson character is now simply called Deathstroke, even by characters who had called him the Terminator for decades. The full title has not completely fallen out of use, having been referenced as recently as Justice League Elite. Fictional character biography Slade Wilson was 16 years old when he enlisted in the United States Army, having lied about his age. After serving a stint in Korea, he was later assigned to Camp Washington where he had been promoted to the rank of major. In the early 1960s, he met Captain Adeline Kane, who was tasked with training young soldiers in new fighting techniques in anticipation of brewing troubles taking place in Vietnam. Kane was amazed at how skilled Slade was and how quickly he adapted to modern conventions of warfare. She immediately fell in love with him and realized that he was without a doubt the most able-bodied combatant that she had ever encountered. She offered to privately train Slade in guerrilla warfare. In less than a year, Slade mastered every fighting form presented to him and was soon promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. Six months later, Adeline and he were married and she became pregnant with their first child. The war in Vietnam began to escalate and Slade was shipped overseas. In the war, his unit massacred a village, an event which sickened him. He was also rescued by SAS member Wintergreen, to whom he would later return the favor. Chosen for a secret experiment, the Army imbued him with enhanced physical powers in an attempt to create metahuman super-soldiers for the U.S. military. Deathstroke became a mercenary soon after the experiment when he defied orders and rescued his friend Wintergreen, who had been sent on a suicide mission by a commanding officer with a grudge. However, Slade kept this career secret from his family, even though his wife was an expert military combat instructor. A criminal named the Jackal took his younger son Joseph Wilson hostage to force Slade to divulge the name of a client who had hired him as an assassin. Slade refused, claiming it was against his personal honor code. He attacked and killed the kidnappers at the rendezvous. Unfortunately, Joseph's throat was slashed by one of the criminals before Slade could prevent it, destroying Joseph's vocal cords and rendering him mute. After taking Joseph to the hospital, Adeline was enraged at his endangerment of her son and tried to kill Slade by shooting him, but only managed to destroy his right eye. Afterwards, his confidence in his physical abilities was such that he made no secret of his impaired vision, marked by his mask which has a black, featureless half covering his lost right eye. Without his mask, Slade wears an eyepatch to cover his eye. He is described being tall and he is one of the tallest criminals. The Teen Titans Slade has a long history as an enemy of the Teen Titans, beginning when his other son Grant received superhuman enhancements from the H.I.V.E., dubbed himself Ravager, and accepted a contract from them to kill or capture the Teen Titans. However, Grant's enhancements proved fatal, and Slade agreed to complete the contract. His first mission involved stealing the element Promethium from S.T.A.R. Labs and selling it as the ultimate weapon. He then kidnapped the Titans and placed them in the path of a Promethium bomb to test his device for the buyers, effectively killing two birds with one stone. The Titans escaped and pursued Deathstroke, but he severely wounded Beast Boy in his escape. This would be the start to a lasting animosity between the two. Deathstroke next appeared in New York, holding officials hostage in order to lure the Titans into confronting him. Terra, a new ally of the Titans, and Beast Boy were the only ones available to answer the call. Terra knocked Beast Boy out and fought Deathstroke single-handedly in an effort to prove herself worthy of being a Titan. Deathstroke escaped as the other Titans arrived, but by then Terra had proven herself and the team offered her membership. Later that night, it was revealed that Terra and Deathstroke had conspired to fake the fight in a plot to infiltrate the team. The Judas Contract The Titans eventually entrusted Terra with all of their secret identities. Once Slade had this information, he used it to systematically subdue each of the Titans, exploiting them at their weakest moments. Donna Troy was gassed at her photo studio, Changeling was anesthetized with tainted envelopes while responding to fan mail, Victor Stone was electrically shocked by a chair in his own apartment, Koriand'r was ambushed with a device that affected her powers, and Raven was taken down by Terra herself. Nightwing was last to be attacked and he was confronted by Deathstroke himself. He avoided being captured and soon discovered that his teammates had already been taken. Nightwing arrived at Titans Tower to discover Slade's ex-wife and son. She told Nightwing that Terra was a traitor, how each of his teammates were captured, and related the origin of Deathstroke. Nightwing, in order to confront Deathstroke and the H.I.V.E., joined Jericho (Joseph Wilson). During the confrontation, Deathstroke recognized Jericho as his son, which caused him to hesitate. Jericho freed the Titans by possessing his father's body. After Terra died during the battle, Slade was then taken into custody. Slade was put on trial for his crimes, but the trial was deliberately sabotaged by Changeling so that he could kill Slade himself, believing that he was responsible for Terra's betrayal of the Titans. Slade agreed to the confrontation, but showed up out of costume. Changeling found himself unable to kill Slade, so instead they talked. Feeling some empathy for his grief, Slade explained his past with Terra, and Changeling realized that Slade was not to blame for the choices that Terra had made. The two men parted on peaceful terms, with Slade returning to Africa with Wintergreen. Titans Plague Months later, Slade encountered the Titans again while they were investigating mysterious attacks and disappearances. Donna Troy is attacked by a group of strange beastmen and barely survives the encounter. Meanwhile, while attending a fundraiser with his father, Gar Logan recognizes Slade trying to maintain a low profile. When he finally catches up with Slade, he finds him about to kill the host of the fundraiser, Walter Lanier. He stops Deathstroke, but is surprised when Lanier turns into a bat-like creature and flies away. Slade reveals to the Titans that he was responsible for smuggling the drug the bestiamorphs were using to transform others, but did not realize what it was until it was too late. After Jericho and Raven were stricken by the plague, he aided them in destroying the beastmen and finding a cure for the contagion. Titans Hunt Shortly after this, he came to the Titans' assistance again during the Titans Hunt storyline. The members of the Titans, as well as many inactive members, all disappeared in a manner very similar to how they were abducted during the Judas Contract. Mento, an on-and-off member of the Doom Patrol, hires Deathstroke to find the missing Titans. He eventually discovers with Nightwing that the abductions were the work of the Wildebeest Society, and that their leader was none other than Titans member Jericho, Deathstroke's son. It was revealed that Jericho had been possessed by the corrupted souls of Azarath, as they were using him to capture the Titans and use them as physical hosts in order to survive. During the transfer process, Jericho's true self resurfaced briefly, begging his father to kill him. To spare his son any more pain and save the remaining Titans, Slade was forced to drive a sword through Jericho's heart, seemingly killing him. Afterward, Slade continued his life as a mercenary, but also acted as an occasional ally to the Titans, aiding them when mutual threats outweighed their rivalry, most notably during the Total Chaos storyline when the Team Titans arrived in the 20th Century to assassinate Donna Troy before she could give birth to her son, who in their timeline had grown up into the tyrannical despot Lord Chaos. Slade also met Pat Trayce, a tough former cop who would become the new Vigilante. Pat Trayce became Slade's lover later on, and the two developed a romantic as well as a professional relationship. Family business After Slade failed an assassination attempt on the President of the United States, he was subsequently framed for the murder of a U.S. Senator. The man responsible had taken on the identity of the Ravager and was hunting down Slade's friends and loved ones. Eventually, with the help of the Titans and Sarge Steel, Slade was able to prove his innocence and the true culprit was revealed to be Steve Dayton, under the alias of the Crime Lord, who had again succumbed to mental instability caused by his Mento helmet. Meanwhile, Slade's relationship with his estranged wife Adeline took a tragic turn, as Slade underwent a process to gain the ability of physical regeneration, allowing him to survive any wound so long as his brain is intact (but this power is limited, as Slade cannot regenerate his lost eye because that injury happened before he gained his healing factor). After gaining this power, Slade was forced to give his wife a blood transfusion to save her life, resulting in her gaining a similar healing factor which manifested itself as a form of immortality. This alteration of her DNA drove Adeline insane, shaming Deathstroke into going into a semi-retirement state. In Titans (vol. 1) #12, Deathstroke teamed up with the Titans to face his wife Adeline, who in her insane state had revived the H.I.V.E. and sought to rid the world of all superhumans, blaming them for Jericho's apparent death. During the battle, interrupted by Vandal Savage and a band of villains that he had organized from recent Titans battles, Adeline's throat was slit. In a brief return of sanity, she begged Slade to kill her, requesting him to reunite her with \\"my... our children...\\" because her version of the healing factor would not heal the wound, but only allow her to live in spite of it. Deathstroke refused, but Koriand'r shocked her teammates and Deathstroke by using her starbolt blast to disintegrate her completely, per Adeline's wishes. This was a turning point, as Deathstroke renounced all ties with the Titans as a result of Starfire's act. It was then revealed that Jericho managed to transfer his consciousness into Deathstroke in the instant before his death. Taking control of his father, Jericho forced Deathstroke to murder his longtime butler, mentor and confidant Wintergreen. He then launched a series of attacks against the current Teen Titans, most notably shattering Impulse's knee with a shotgun blast, before leaving his father's body. Deathstroke has since manipulated his one remaining child Rose Wilson into the mercenary business as the new Ravager, in order to find and kill Jericho, using a specially designed serum to heighten her hostility and push her over the edge. Unfortunately, the process also resulted in her being driven at least partially insane, to the extent that she cut out her own left eye in an attempt to prove to her father that she was just like him. Nightwing and Birds of Prey Deathstroke appeared in Nightwing #23 as a mercenary against Black Canary and Conner Hawke as part of the \\"Brotherhood of the Fist\\" tie-in to the No Man's Land story arc.Nightwing #23 Deathstroke also appeared in Birds of Prey #22‚Äì24, where he was sent to Gorilla City by Blockbuster to get an ape-heart. He is accompanied by Lady Vic, Grimm, and Black Canary, who is posing as Oracle. Identity Crisis In the Identity Crisis miniseries, Deathstroke was enlisted as a bodyguard for Doctor Light, who was being pursued by the Justice League of America as a suspect in the murder of Sue Dibny. In the ensuing battle, Deathstroke nearly beat the team of Elongated Man, Flash, Zatanna, Hawkman, Green Arrow, Black Canary, Atom and Green Lantern. He systematically took out every member except for Rayner, whom he had the potential to disable through trying to usurp his ring's energies using his own formidable willpower. But before the outcome of this conflict with Green Lantern ended, Green Arrow stuck an arrow in Deathstroke's right eye socket, enraging him. Slade went ballistic, which derailed his pre-planned strategy and began to beat Green Arrow, but was stopped when the majority of the team tackled Deathstroke to the ground. Dr. Light used his powers to allow the two to escape. Near the end of Identity Crisis, Deathstroke confronts Green Arrow on a rooftop. Arrow sees his reflection in the windows of a nearby building, but when he turns to confront Slade, Deathstroke is gone. Instead, Green Arrow finds Slade's cowl and a note stuck to the wall by the very arrow he stabbed in Slade's eye socket. The note reads \\"This is yours ‚Äì we're not done.\\" Infinite Crisis Deathstroke was a founding member of Lex Luthor's Secret Society of Super Villains in the Infinite Crisis storyline. He was seen in Infinite Crisis #1, hiding in a warehouse south of Metropolis waiting to ambush the Freedom Fighters with several other members. The battle did not last long, and by the end, Deathstroke had killed the Phantom Lady. Slade is also the one who landed the final stroke on Uncle Sam by shooting him in the back (and leading to his apparent death). He was the employer of Nightwing, whom he hired to train his daughter Rose. However, after the two had a confrontation with Superman, Deathstroke discovered that Nightwing had been teaching Rose the values of heroism. He could not kill Grayson in front of his daughter, because doing so would undo all of Slade's teachings. Nightwing offered a deal: he would stay away from Rose if Slade would keep the metahuman villains out of Bl√ºdhaven. The deal held for 34 hours until Infinite Crisis #4, when Slade, under the orders of Alexander Luthor, Jr., the real leader of the Society, went with several villains (including old Titans and Doom Patrol foes and Brotherhood of Evil members Monsieur Mallah and Brain) to drop Chemo, another fellow villain who appeared to be a nearly brainless monster made of pure energy and radioactive chemicals, on Bl√ºdhaven, killing over 100,000 people. Slade gave the explanation to the Brotherhood that Nightwing should be made to believe that he can never go home again. Nightwing took the first of his revenge by bursting in on Deathstroke and Rose's training session, revealing to the latter that the kryptonite that Deathstroke had implanted in place of her missing eye was radioactive and deadly to humans as well as to Kryptonians (as revealed by Luthor's old possession of a kryptonite ring that had forced him to transfer his brain to a cloned body). Angered, Slade went after Nightwing with a grenade, only to have Rose try to stop him. Amid the smoke of the resulting explosion, Rose fled, telling her father that she hated him. Nightwing disappeared as well, but not before leaving a note for Slade warning him that he would be back to make him pay for Bl√ºdhaven. At the climactic Battle of Metropolis at the conclusion of Infinite Crisis, Slade was confronted by Batman, Robin and Nightwing. During the struggle, he was questioned regarding his motives for aiding the Secret Society. His claims of monetary motivation were deemed unsatisfactory; Batman accused him of having forsaken his code of honor, and Nightwing said it was because his family had abandoned him. Enraged, Slade said that was because of Nightwing, and that it was always because of him, before Batman told him to take responsibility for his actions and he was rendered unconscious. One Year Later Cover of Teen Titans #43: \\"Titans East Part 1\\". Art by Tony Daniel. Slade appears in the Green Arrow series after the one year jump in DC Comics' storylines. Apparently in hiding, he nearly murders a crony of several Star City businessmen who want to hire him for a murder. Before finishing his violent refusal, he asks the name of the target. When informed that it was to be the mayor of Star City, Oliver Queen (whom Deathstroke knows is secretly Green Arrow), he spares the lackey and decides to take the job.Green Arrow #60 (May 2006) However, things do not quite go according to plan, with Green Arrow using the resources of both his identities, trapping him within a ring of armed National Guardsmen.Green Arrow #62 (July 2006) The fight ends with Deathstroke's arrestGreen Arrow #63 (August 2006) and subsequent conviction and incarceration;Green Arrow #64 (September 2006) however, this is revealed as a ploy to gain access to Constantine Drakon, another jailed foe of Green Arrow who has information on the hero's activities in the lost year,Green Arrow #65 (October 2006) which include Green Arrow studying under Natas, an assassin who once trained Deathstroke himself.Green Arrow #66 (November 2006) Deathstroke is also active behind the scenes in Teen Titans, currently in the process of organizing a counter-team of teen superhumans that will be known as Titans East. The current Titans team included Ravager, who now wanted nothing to do with her father. Deathstroke seemingly intended to \\"reclaim\\" Ravager and a recently resurrected Jericho from the Titans or, if that failed, to crush them along with the rest of the team. For these reasons, he specially selected each member of Titans East, believing that, overall, each member would successfully counteract every member of the current Teen Titans line-up. As indicated over the course of the subsequent issues, Deathstroke was manipulating every member of his new team in one way or another. He had blackmailed former Titan Risk while at the same time offering him an outlet for his rage; was drugging Batgirl with the same serum he had used on Rose; and supplied Inertia with a formula which granted superhuman speed to compensate for the loss of the Speed Force following the initial battle with Superboy-Prime. His team, however, slowly fell apart over the course of the attack, as Robin managed to free Batgirl of his mind control serum and Raven convinced Duela Dent to switch sides. Slade and his remaining Titans subsequently faced off against both the current Titans and a group of old Titans led by Nightwing. Although he was defeated, he still managed to escape with the aid of Inertia. In the end, however, it was revealed to the readers that Slade's real mission was to provide his children with something he could never offer them: a real family, in the form of the Teen Titans. By attacking the Titans, he insured that Rose and Jericho would become more trusted by their associates, and thus grow closer to the team. Recently, Deathstroke took credit for somehow twisting (through unknown means) the powers of Geo-Force, the half-brother of the original Terra, into the same powers as his traitorous sister. Using this leverage, Deathstroke offered to reverse the process only if Geo-Force became his own personal spy within the Justice League. Unfortunately for Deathstroke, Geo-Force alerted Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman of Deathstroke's scheme, which culminated in Geo-Force alerting the League that Deathstroke (whose rivalry with Green Arrow had reached vendetta- level proportions) planned on using an army of supervillains to crash Green Arrow and Black Canary's wedding. Weeks later, Geo-Force was tortured by Gorilla Grodd after the League was kidnapped by the Injustice League, and ultimately transferred to Batman's newest incarnation of the Outsiders afterward, robbing Deathstroke of his potential pawn. Deathstroke can be seen as a member of Libra's Secret Society of Super Villains. Deathstroke is gravely injured with his own sword by Geo-Force in DC Universe: Last Will and Testament. Following his injury, he is recuperating at Belle Reve while doctors labor to save him. Deathstroke dreams of his family members and all of the people that he has let down. When he awakens, he vows that he will never again be haunted by the past. Ravager comes to visit him, but in fact, wants to finish her father off. She tries to strangle him with a plastic wire, but Deathstroke is recuperated enough that he can fend off her attack. He escapes from the facility and steals a helicopter. Later, Deathstroke finds a young street urchin that he decides to take under his wing.Faces of Evil: Deathstroke Blackest Night In the Teen Titans (vol. 3) tie-in to the Blackest Night crossover event, Deathstroke is living in the deceased Wintergreen's house and reading his journal, when he is attacked by Rose again. During the fight, the two are attacked by their deceased relatives Grant, Wade, and Adeline, who, along with Wintergreen, have all been reanimated as Black Lanterns. Deathstroke and Rose are forced to work together and fight for their lives against the Black Lanterns.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #77 (November 2009) The two hopelessly fight the regenerating Black Lanterns until Jericho, cured from his earlier insanity, arrives and turns the tide of the fight. During the course of the battle, Deathstroke confesses to his children that part of the reason why he menaced the Teen Titans for so many years was that he felt that by forcing his children to hate him, they would have a chance of escaping the sorrow and pain that a life with him would entail. Just as Slade is overwhelmed and about to be killed, Jericho somehow uses his abilities to sever the connection between the Black Lanterns and their power rings, permanently sending them back to the grave. After realizing that her mother was not reborn as a member of the Black Lantern Corps, Rose comes to the conclusion that she must somehow still be alive, and leaves after threatening to kill Slade if he tries to stop her. Jericho chooses to stay with his father, reasoning that only Slade would have the courage to kill him if he were to ever return to madness.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #78 (December 2009) Batman and Robin Recently, Deathstroke has been seen working with Talia al Ghul, controlling the body and physical actions of the current Robin in order to kill the recent Batman. Deathstroke is able to control Robin's actions, thanks to a neural-implant inserted into Robin's spine by his mother while it was being surgically replaced. Batman defeats Deathstroke by taking advantage of the two-way connection between him and Robin by using a taser on Robin, the resulting electric shock overwhelming Deathstroke's enhanced senses. He then tracks Slade down and attacks him in his hospital bed for controlling Robin and for the Chemo attack, informing Slade that what happened then is just a 'trailer' for what he will do later.Batman and Robin #9 (February 2010) Titans: Villains for Hire Following the encounter with the Black Lanterns, Deathstroke recruits a team of supervillains consisting of Tattooed Man, Cheshire, Osiris, and the new character Cinder following the launch of Brightest Day. The team ambushes Ryan Choi in his home, and then battles him. This ends with Deathstroke driving his sword through Ryan's chest, killing him. He then gives the deceased hero's body to Dwarfstar.Titans: Villains for Hire Special #1 (May 2010) Following the assassination of the Atom, Deathstroke and the Titans are hired to kill Lex Luthor during his stay in Midway City. The attack is revealed to be a ruse crafted by Slade and Luthor in order to draw out a traitor on Luthor's security staff, who is revealed to be a shape-shifting assassin named Facade.Titans (vol. 2) #24‚Äì25 After the Titans capture Facade and turn him over to the scientists at LexCorp, Luthor rewards Slade by examining technology that he had earlier ordered Tattooed Man and Cheshire to steal. Slade claims that this will bring him one step closer to his true goal: the ability to somehow cheat death itself. He also succeeds in recruiting Arsenal, a former member of the Teen Titans and Justice League, into the team.Titans (vol. 2) #26 Shortly after inducting Arsenal into the team, Slade accepts a mission to rescue a child from a drug lord named Elijah. After discovering that Elijah is using the bodies of kidnapped children to create an addictive drug called Bliss, the Titans promptly kill the gangster and shut down his operation. As the Titans are preparing to return to the Labyrinth, Cheshire notices that Slade has tied up DJ Molecule, a powerful metahuman who was working for Elijah as a bodyguard. When asked what he is doing with the young man, Slade cryptically responds by saying that he only accepted the mission in order capture Molecule for some unknown purpose.Titans (vol. 2) #27 Afterward, Slade and his team arrive at South Pacific Island to kill cult leader Drago over the arena production of blind warriors; however, his team, Arsenal, and Cheshire betray him, revealing that they had been working with Drago. While Slade is held captive, Drago arrives and reveals to him that he is actually Slade's old friend, Corporal Daniel Rogers, who abandoned him during the civil war in Afghanistan. Drago then gouges out Slade's left eye making him blind.Titans (vol. 2) #33 (March 2011) Slade is then imprisoned along with Arsenal and begins to tell him about his past with Drago.Titans (vol. 2) #34 (April 2011) Later, Drago takes a trip down memory lane with Slade, explaining how he lost his sight, and basically re-telling his origin and how it involved Jeremiah, right before he throws Slade beneath the complex to fend for his life against a crazed subhuman.Titans (vol. 2) #35 (May 2011) During the fights, Slade's left eye was restored due to his metahuman healing factor, and the Titans arrive to rescue him. Slade and the Titans break into Drago's mansion and attack. Slade drugs Drago so that he cannot focus his telepathic powers. When Drago is defeated, Slade allows him to live and the Titans then leave his island. While returning to the labyrinth, Slade and the Titans are approached by the Atom and the Justice League, who attempt to arrest them for the murder of Ryan Choi.Titans (vol. 2) #36 (June 2011) During the battle of Slade's Titans against the Justice League in Khandaq, the battle was stopped by Isis, who forces them to choose between leaving or continuing the fight and starting World War III. The Justice League chose to retreat and Slade retrieves a sample of Supergirl's Kryptonian blood. Upon returning to the labyrinth, with his workers, Doctor Sivana and Doctor Impossible, Slade reveals to the Titans that their efforts support creation of a diabolical invention called the \\"Methuselah Device\\" for his dying son Jericho.Titans Annual 2011 (July 2011) The machine successfully heals Jericho, and Slade offers its abilities to all the Titans, offering to restore their deceased loved ones as payment for their services. All agree but Cinder, who does not want her brothers to live forever, as she claims to be doing. She attacks Cheshire and Osiris, and is then joined by Tattooed Man and Arsenal. As the Titans come to blows, Deathstroke attempts to take Jericho and leave, but Jericho, disgusted at what his father did to achieve his restoration, takes over his body, intending to destroy first the Methuselah Device, then himself and Deathstroke.Titans (vol. 2) #37 (July 2011) While the Titans fight over the Methuselah Device, its power source, a metahuman named DJ Molecule, is released. DJ Molecule blasts Slade, knocking Jericho out of his body. Arsenal then attacks him for stealing the Titans' legacy. Slade escapes and the Methuselah Device is destroyed by Cinder. Afterwards, Slade berates himself and becomes Deathstroke once more.Titans (vol. 2) #38 (August 2011) The New 52 In The New 52 (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Deathstroke is known as a top mercenary around the world.Deathstroke #1 Deathstroke is hired by a man named Cristoph for a mission that forces him to work with a team of younger mercenaries known as the Alpha Dogs. Their target is Jeffrey Bode, an arms dealer traveling on a plane. After discovering that the weapons Bode is trafficking are clones of the villain Clayface, Deathstroke and the other mercenaries are able to dispatch them, killing Bode in the process and retrieving a suitcase he had in his possession. Deathstroke subsequently betrays and kills the Alpha Dogs, enraged by the notion that his employers feel that he is unable to accomplish his tasks alone. Deathstroke then begins to take on increasingly dangerous missions in an effort to prove his worth, but is also spurred on by the contents of the suitcase he retrieved from Bode ‚Äì namely the mask and knife belonging to his son Grant, both of which were stained with fresh blood, indicating that he may be still alive.Deathstroke #2 During this time, Deathstroke is pursued by a new villain known as Legacy.Deathstroke #5 Deathstroke kills Legacy, but another Legacy, donning the same colors as the last one, appears again and again. It turns out the parents of one of the Alpha Dog members have hired multiple mercenaries to kill Deathstroke, all donning the green and purple color, to get revenge on him. Deathstroke tracks them down, but is confronted by his son Grant. It is revealed that all of this has been a plot to lure Deathstroke to him. Although Deathstroke manages to kill both the parents, Grant defeats him, claiming superiority over Deathstroke. Grant is about to finish Slade, but he hesitates, and leaves. Recovering from his injuries, Grant takes another contract, Slade is happy that his son has become a better warrior than him, and then visits his father's hospital bed to mention that he has grown up to be a greater man than him. Slade takes a contract from Harvest, to bring the Ravagers back to the colony. He does this in exchange for his daughter Rose and Terra. It turns out that Lynch, the leader of Team 7 had needed Terra to stop a rampaging Majestic, who was thought to be killed by Dinah Drake's sonic scream. For a plan B, to Slade's dismay, he calls in Joseph Wilson, now going by the name Jericho, with Adeline and Grant, to stop Majestic. Instead of stopping Majestic, Jericho takes control of Majestic, Adeline, Grant, and Terra in order to kill his father. Adeline dies, buried in the rubble caused by Majestic's stampede. Jericho momentarily loses control by this time, and Slade, Rose, and Terra manages to restrain Majestic, with the help of Rose's Gen-factor. However, Jericho retains control over Grant and Terra. When Slade knocks Terra unconscious, a cornered Jericho threatens to stab himself and Grant with a sword. Deathstroke, without hesitation, drives the sword into both of them, killing them instantly. But a later scene suggests Jericho has escaped, since there is shown a worker with glowing green eyes walking out of the clean-up scene, strongly implying Jericho has possessed the man to flee. =Origins= Deathstroke's altered origin is introduced in Deathstroke #0. The fact that he participated in the military at 16 and met Adeline has not changed. Already a legend in the army, Slade was drafted into Team 7 and went on many missions. In one mission, Slade was gravely injured and had to undergo an operation that enhanced his abilities, making him virtually a superhuman. After this, he married Adeline and had two sons, Grant and Joseph. Around this time, Slade received intel that his best friend, Wintergreen was caught in Somalia. He donned a mask and flew to Somalia to rescue Wintergreen, slaughtering all the captors. Deathstroke the Terminator was born. As his fame grew, his enemies did too. An attack targeting his house seemingly killed Joseph and Adeline. With evidence that the attack was from North Korea, Slade killed a group of North Korean soldiers, but lost his right eye in the process. It is later shown that Joseph and Adeline are still alive. This origin was again changed in Teen Titans: Deathstroke #1. After a mission that involved destroying a children's hospital which Slade was unaware of, he quit the army. After Team 7's termination, Slade started to operate under the Deathstroke identity. He took Grant on his mission, considering him as not only his son, but as a business partner, and the only person he could trust. But during a mission in North Korea, their refuge was infiltrated and North Korean soldiers barged in, firing into the house. Grant was shot, and as Slade looked back at his son, a bullet penetrated his right eye, blinding it. Enraged, Slade went on a massacre and slew the soldiers. However, Grant was presumed dead. Now, Slade works for the sake of his daughter Rose, as he knows the only thing that will keep Rose safe after he is gone is money. It is unclear if Rose's mother is Adeline or not. =Team 7= Five years before taking the contract from Harvest, before taking the name Deathstroke, Slade once operated with Team 7. With metahuman threats rising, The Majestic Project, a plan to control future metahuman threats was devised by John Lynch. And to secure the project, Team 7 was created and Slade was recruited. The first mission was retrieving the Eclipso Gem, where Slade was possessed by Eclipso and Alex Fairchild had to drive a sword through his chest to save him. Their next mission site is the Advanced Prosthetic Research Center. Dr. Henshaw is tasked into reactivating the android Spartan. But the Spartan Subject is activated, infecting everyone in the center to be turned into mindless cyborgs, including Caitlin Fairchild. Team 7 is sent to the spot. Pilot Summer Ramos is killed by a cyborg. The team breaks into the facility, intending to bottleneck them. Caitlin appears out from a door. Relieved to see his daughter, Alex Fairchild rushes to her and hugs her, but actually infected, Caitlin stabs her father to death. In a fit of rage, Slade chases after her and dispatches her. Then from behind, Henshaw, temporarily free of the Spartan virus, explained that this was a distraction by the Spartan Subject to target agent James Bronson, currently at his home. A Spartan cyborg breaks into his apartment, and attacks, activating Majestic. Majestic actually turns out to be agent Bronson's Gen-factor, which was activated when the Kaizen, the dictator of the island nation of Gamorra, sent the cyborg to trigger the Majestic Persona. It is later explained by Lynch that another purpose of Team 7 was to activate potential metagenes in the agents to create powerful human weapons, which would make America invincible to other nations. Agents like Slade, Dinah Drake, and Cole Cash had gained their metahuman abilities by Lynch. Bronson was planned to be Majestic, but the activation of the gene just then had been unexpected. Team 7's last mission was to salvage Pandora's Box. The Team, with new pilot Steve Trevor is sent to Gamorra. The Kaizen, who possessed Pandora's Box, prepared to unleash its power. When they reach the Kaizen's palace, the child precogs show the Team a future where Kaizen Gamorra has opened the Box, and the whole world is going off the rails. Hearing the precogs say the Kaizen had to be stopped to prevent this fate, Majestic flies up into space, and impacts the coast of Gamorra with the force of a comet, creating a massive tidal wave, annihilating five million residents. But the Kaizen's palace stood however, and the team couldn't defeat him, until Majestic burst in. The Kaizen explains that Majestic is the key to opening the box, which also explains why he targeted Bronson in the first place. Majestic kills the Kaizen with a single blow. But he subdues to the Box's power, and starts attacking the team. Dinah lets out a canary cry that destroys the entire palace. In the chaos, Lynch is possessed by the box, but Amanda Waller knocks the box from his hands and tells Dinah to take the box away as far as possible. Lynch tries to take down the helicopter containing Dinah and the remaining team agents, but Waller shoots him from behind, seemingly killing Lynch and leading to Team 7's dissolution. =Forever Evil= During the Forever Evil storyline, Steve Trevor encounters Deathstroke, Copperhead, and Shadow Thief at the White House when he is looking for the President.Forever Evil: A.R.G.U.S. #1 Later, the party turns up in Wayne Industries with Power Ring to fight Batman, Lex Luthor, and other heroes and villains who are against the Crime Syndicate. Deathstroke has Lex Luthor's life in his hands, but Lex Luthor persuades him that it will do him no good if the Syndicate takes over the Earth. Slade has a change of mind and shoots Copperhead in the head, killing him. After they defeat the rest of the gang, Deathstroke remarks that Lex Luthor ought to pay him a big fat check after this is over.Forever Evil #5 Deathstroke then joins Batman and Luthor in the battle against the syndicate he is seen battling Deathstorm when the Syndicate attacks the fallen watchtower. The syndicate later retreats when they find out that Alexander Luthor has been freed. Deathstroke witnesses the only \\"hero\\" from Earth-Three kill Deathstorm and steal his abilities. Alexander Luthor then attacks Deathstroke, shattering his helmet while he lets out a string of obscenities directed at Luthor. DC Rebirth In DC Rebirth, Deathstroke, along with Lady Shiva, is mentioned as one of the enemies that Batman thinks may be attacking him on Two-Face's orders.All-Star Batman #4 He also stars in an ongoing series about his exploits as a mercenary and his tumultuous relationship with his ex-wife and children. During one such operation, he comes into contract with the Red Lion/Matthew Bland, the President/Dictator of the African nation of Buredunia.Deathstroke: Rebirth #1 Bland offers him a high sum for making sure his competition does not bring in US forces, and later takes one of Slade's Promethium suits for himself.Deathstroke: Rebirth #4 Later, Slade attempts to save his son Grant from dying in battle with the Teen Titans by using Speed Force energy drained from Kid Flash to time travel. He becomes trapped in the Speed Force in the process, but is rescued the Titans and Teen Titans. The experience moves him to give up being Deathstroke, so he builds a team of heroes called Defiance, with both his children, Wintergreen, Adeline Kane and Wallace as his teammates.Deathstroke #18 It was later disbanded after Power Girl committed suicide, and Slade's attempts have grown worse to himself.Deathstroke #20 Deathstroke was later imprisoned in Arkham Asylum, though he escapes and is later captured by the new Damian Wayne's new roster of Teen Titans.Teen Titans #28 (2019) In a bid to fulfill his death-wish, he releases all the inmates that Robin had been locking up illegally to attack the group. He tried to goad Damian into killing him, but he was instead killed by Red Arrow.‚ÄùDeathstroke‚Äù #43 Other versions Earth One In Teen Titans: Earth One continuity, an unscarred Slade is a member of S.T.A.R.

He is simply referred to as \\"Slade\\", as the name \\"Deathstroke\\" was not considered suitable for a show airing on Cartoon Network. He is depicted as an enigmatic criminal mastermind rather than an assassin, dispatching scores of other supervillains and robotic henchmen to eliminate the Teen Titans. In the first season, Slade manipulated and blackmails Robin into becoming his apprentice, though the Titans ultimately free Robin from Slade's control. In the second season, Slade searches for a new protege in the metahuman Terra, making her a double-agent and her new apprentice, only for her to sacrifice herself to take out Slade and save the Titans. In the fourth season, Slade is resurrected as an undead pyrokinetic being by the demon Trigon to aid in his conquest of Earth. Slade later betrays Trigon and temporarily joins forces with the Titans to defeat him, reclaiming his life-force in the process before disappearing. In the fifth season finale, a robotic duplicate of Slade taunts and torments Beast Boy over his failure to save Terra. * Deathstroke appears in Young Justice, voiced by Wentworth Miller in \\"The Fix\\" and by Fred Tatasciore for all subsequent appearances. He first appears in the season two episode \\"True Colors\\", during which he takes Sportsmaster's place as The Light's enforcer, and he serves as Black Manta's personal assassin for the remainder of the season. Deathstroke returns in season three, having replaced Ra's al Ghul as a member of The Light and the leader of the League of Shadows. He and Lady Shiva forge an alliance with Bane to form a metahuman trafficking ring on the island of Santa Prisca. After Nightwing's Outsiders team seemingly frees the metahuman Princess Terra Markov from The Light's captivity, Terra is revealed to be a double-agent working for Deathstroke. However, Terra is ultimately persuaded by her new friends to turn on Deathstroke and The Light. * Deathstroke appears in Beware the Batman, voiced by Robin Atkin Downes. This version of Slade Wilson was originally a CIA agent who was terminated by his mentor Alfred Pennyworth for his ruthless methods. Slade then became the international assassin \\"Deathstroke\\", and is eventually hired by Anarky and Harvey Dent to kill Batman. Deathstroke accepts the contract in order to exact revenge on Pennyworth, who has since \\"replaced\\" him with Bruce Wayne as a prot√©g√©. Slade poses as \\"Dane Lisslow\\" for most of the program's run to get close to Bruce and Alfred, and he enacts a complex scheme to ruin Batman‚Äôs reputation. He loses his right eye during a fight with Batman in the series finale, and has his memory erased with a gas created by Man-Bat and Metamorpho. * The character (once again referred to as \\"Slade\\") is alluded several times in Teen Titans Go! His face can be seen on Robin's punching bag in numerous episodes, and he is indirectly mentioned by his daughter Rose Wilson / Ravager in the episode \\"Cool School\\", when she tells Raven that they both have father issues. In the episode \\"Terra-ized\\", Terra infiltrates the Titans Tower to steal the team's secrets for a mysterious criminal mastermind, implied to be Slade. Despite his name being in the titile of \\"The Return of Slade\\", the character is not featured in the episode; instead, the Titans battle him off-screen, later commenting on how amazing it was. Slade's only physical appearance in the series is briefly at the end of \\"The Titans Show\\", where he is among the villains summoned by Control Freak to fight the Titans. The character was most likely omitted from the series so that he could make a proper debut in the film Teen Titans Go! to the Movies. * In May 2019, The CW announced the animated series Deathstroke: Knights & Dragons for their CW Seed platform. The series premiered in January 2020. Michael Chiklis provided the voice for the character. * Deathstroke appears in the DC Super Hero Girls episode \\"#DinnerForFive\\", voiced by D. C. Douglas. While still a mercenary, this version is also a caring father towards his daughter Rose (who is aware of his profession) and is trying to reconnect with her after being absent for most of her life. While targeting Commissioner Gordon, Deathstroke battles Batgirl, and later recognizes her alter-ego when Rose invites her for dinner. Once again fighting Batgirl, Deathstroke almost kills her, but is stopped from doing so by Rose. Apologizing for betraying his daughter's trust, he promises not to bother the Gordons anymore and decides to take some time off to work on rebuilding his relationship with Rose. * Deathstroke is referenced in DC Universe's web series Harley Quinn. In the episode \\"Trapped\\", his sword is shown on display in Doctor Trap's museum, and is used by Harley Quinn to free Kite Man from a trap. His name also appears in Doctor Psycho's phone in \\"A Fight Worth Fighting For\\". = Live-action = * In the Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman episode \\"Bob and Carol and Lois and Clark\\", Antonio Sab√†to Jr portrayed 'Earl Gregg, who utilised the Deathstroke name but was otherwise unaffiliated with the character. * Slade Wilson appears in the tenth season of Smallville, portrayed by Michael Hogan. This version is a United States Army Lieutenant General and a suspected war criminal behind the anti-superhero Vigilante Registration Act legislation. Slade is later saved from death by Darkseid with advanced military technology, losing his right eye but gaining healing abilities in the process (rendering him \\"beyond Death's stroke\\"). * Multiple characters have taken on the Deathstroke mantle in The CW's live-action Arrowverse, most notably being featured on Arrow. ** Bill \\"Billy\\" Wintergreen (portrayed by Jeffery C. Robinson) appears in flashbacks as Slade Wilson's former friend and partner at the ASIS. He is later killed by Slade for his betrayal. ** Manu Bennett portrays Slade Wilson himself. He is introduced as an ASIS agent sent to extract ex-Chinese military member Yao Fei from the island of Lian Yu. Throughout the first and second seasons' flashbacks, Slade trains marooned playboy Oliver Queen while they are stranded together on the island, beginning Queen's path in becoming a vigilante. When Slade is mortally wounded, Oliver gives him the \\"mirakuru\\" supersoldier serum which saves his life and grants him superhuman physical attributes, though it also drives Slade insane and causes him to despise Oliver for the death of Shado, whom Slade was in love with. Oliver is forced to drive an arrow through Slade's right eye in an attempt to kill him. In season two's present day narrative, Slade returns as the mercenary \\"Deathstroke\\" and wreaks havoc on Oliver's life, killing his mother and overwhelming Starling City with mirakuru-enhanced soldiers. Oliver ultimately manages to defeat and imprison Slade in an A.R.G.U.S. prison on Lian Yu. In the season three episode \\"The Return\\", Slade escapes his underground confinement and torments Oliver and his sister Thea during their training session on Lian Yu, though he is recaptured. Deathstroke is briefly seen in the season four episode \\"Genesis\\" as a vision, and reappears in the show's 100th episode as a Dominator-induced hallucination. Slade returns during the final two episodes of the fifth season, forming an alliance with Oliver against Prometheus. In the sixth season's episodes \\"Fallout\\", \\"Deathstroke Returns\\" and \\"Promises Kept\\", Slade tracks down his son Joe. In the eighth season during the series finale, after the events of the Crisis on Infinite Earths crossover reset the multiverse, Oliver is revealed to have managed to prevent Slade from killing his mother, leaving Deathstroke's fate after being defeated uncertain in this new reality. ** Grant Wilson (portrayed by Jamie Andrew Cutler) takes up the Deathstroke mantle and continues his father's legacy. In the Legends of Tomorrow episode \\"Star City 2046\\", he is defeated by Connor Hawke and an older Oliver Queen. Grant reappears in the eighth season as the leader of the Deathstroke Gang. ** Joe Wilson (portrayed by Liam Hall) first appears as Slade's son in the episodes \\"Deathstroke Returns\\" and \\"Promises Kept\\" under the name Kane Wolfman. He later wears Deathstroke's suit during the crossover event \\"Elseworlds\\". ** John Diggle Jr. (portrayed by Charlie Barnett) appears in the seventh and eighth seasons. During flashforwards that take place in 2040, he replaces Grant Wilson as the leader of the Deathstroke Gang. Esai Morales as Slade Wilson / Deathstroke in a promotional video for Titans. * Esai Morales portrays Slade Wilson/Deathstroke on the DC Universe web television series Titans. Introduced in season two, this version is a former member of the military organization H.I.V.E. who underwent an experiment that enhanced his physical abilities. Slade secretly began operating as the assassin \\"Deathstroke\\" upon being discharged, though his wife Adeline discovered this when their son Jericho was rendered mute by his enemies. After Adeline left him, Slade had a one-night stand with a prostitute and unintentionally impregnated her with a daughter named Rose, who inherited his regenerative healing. In 2014, Deathstroke killed Titans member Aqualad whilst attempting to fulfill a contract. Dick Grayson then revealed Slade's true nature to Jericho and recruited him to join the Titans. As Slade attempts to kill Dick for fracturing his relationship with his son, Jericho sacrifices himself to save Grayson before transferring his consciousness into Slade's body, inadvertently trapping himself within his father's mind. In the present day narrative, Slade comes out of retirement upon learning that Dick has assembled a new team of Titans, vowing to kill them for \\"destroying\\" his family. To tear the Titans apart, Slade plants Rose as a double agent within their ranks and briefly forms an alliance with Dr. Light. His plan ultimately fails as the Titans reunite and Rose defects to their side and stabs Deathstroke in the chest, leaving his fate uncertain.

It is subdivided into 100 linksMathematics Dictionary (p 453), R.C. James, (PDF) or 4 rods. There are 10 chains in a furlong, and 80 chains in one statute mile. In metric terms, it is 20.1168 m long. By extension, chainage (running distance) is the distance along a curved or straight survey line from a fixed commencing point, as given by an odometer. The chain has been used for several centuries in England and in some other countries influenced by English practice. In the United Kingdom, there were 80 chains to the mile, but until the early nineteenth century the Scottish and Irish customary miles were longer than the statute mile; consequently a Scots chain was about 74 (imperial) feet, an Irish chain 84 feet. These longer chains became obsolete following the adoption of the imperial system in 1824. Definition The UK statute chain is 22 yards, which is . This unit is a statute measure in the United Kingdom, defined in the Weights and Measures Act 1985. One link is a hundredth part of a chain, which is . Origin The surveyor's chain was first mentioned 1579 and appears in an illustration in 1607. In 1593 the English mile was redefined by a statute of Queen Elizabeth I as 5280 feet, to tie in with agricultural practice. In 1620, the polymath Edmund Gunter developed a method of accurately surveying land using a surveyor's chain 66 feet long with 100 links. The 66 feet unit, which was four perches or rods, took on the name the chain. By 1675 it was accepted, and Ogilby wrote: > ...a Word or two of Dimensurators or Measuring Instruments, whereof the > mosts usual has been the Chain, and the common length for English Measures 4 > Poles, as answering indifferently to the Englishs Mile and Acre, 10 such > Chains in length making a Furlong, and 10 single square Chains an Acre, so > that a square Mile contains 640 square Acres...' John Ogilby, Britannia, 1675 From Gunter's system, the chain and the link became standard surveyors' units of length and crossed to the colonies. The thirteen states of America were expanding westward and the public land had to be surveyed for a cadastral. In 1784 Thomas Jefferson wrote a report for the Continental Congress proposing the rectangular survey system; it was adopted with some changes as the Land Ordinance of 1785 on 20 May the following year. In the report, the use of the chain as a unit of measurement was mandated, and the chain was defined. > The chain is the unit of linear measurement for the survey of the public > lands as prescribed by law. All returns of measurement in the rectangular > system are made in the true horizontal distance in links, chains, and miles. > The only exceptions to this rule are special requirements for measurement in > feet in mineral surveys and townsite surveys.

Johnson (SPON) However it survives on the railways of the United Kingdom as a location identifier. When railways were designed, the location of features such as bridges and stations was indicated by a cumulative longitudinal \\"mileage\\", using miles and chains, from a zero point at the origin or headquarters of the railway, or the originating junction of a new branch line. Since railways are entirely linear in topology, the \\"mileage\\" or \\"chainage\\" is sufficient to identify a place uniquely on any given route. Thus a certain bridge location may be indicated as 112 miles and 63 chains (181.51 km) from the origin. In the case of the photograph the bridge is near Keynsham, that distance from London Paddington station. The indication \\"MLN\\" after the mileage is the engineers' line reference describing the route as the Great Western Main Line, so that visiting engineers can uniquely describe the bridge they are inspecting, as there may be bridges at 112 miles 63 chains on other routes. On new railway lines built in the United Kingdom such as High Speed 1, the position along the alignment is still called \\"chainage\\" although the value is now defined in metres.HS2 proposed alignment with chainages expressed in metres North America The use of the chain was mandatory in laying out US townships. A federal law was passed in 1785 (the Public Land Survey Ordinance) that all official government surveys must be done with a Gunter's (surveyor's) chain. Chains and links are commonly encountered in older metes and bounds legal descriptions. Distances on township plat maps made by the US General Land Office are shown in chains. Under the US Public Land Survey System, parcels of land are often described in terms of the section (), quarter- section (), and quarter-quarter-section (). Respectively, these square divisions of land are approximately 80 chains (one mile or 1.6 km), 40 chains (half a mile or 800 m), and 20 chains (a quarter mile or 400 m) on a side. The chain is still used in agriculture: measuring wheels with a circumference of 0.1 chain (diameter ‚âà 2.1 ft or 64 cm) are still readily available in Canada and the United States. For a rectangular tract, multiplying the number of turns of a chain wheel for each of two adjacent sides and dividing by 1000 gives the area in acres. In Canada, road allowances were originally 1 chain wide and are now 20 metres. The unit was also used in mapping the United States along train routes in the 19th century. Railroads in the United States have long since used decimal fractions of a mile. Some subways such as the New York City Subway and the Washington Metro were designed with and continue with a chaining system using the 100-foot engineer's chain. In the United States, the chain is also used as the measure of the rate of spread of wildfires (chains per hour), both in the predictive National Fire Danger Rating System as well as in after-action reports. The term chain is used by wildland firefighters in day-to-day operations as a unit of distance.Documents Australia and New Zealand In Australia and New Zealand, most building lots in the past were a quarter of an acre, measuring one chain by two and a half chains, and other lots would be multiples or fractions of a chain. The street frontages of many houses in these countries are one chain wide‚Äîroads were almost always wide in urban areas, sometimes or . Laneways would be half a chain (10.1 m). In rural areas the roads were wider, up to where a stock route was required. roads were surveyed as major roads or highways between larger towns, roads between smaller localities, and roads were local roads in farming communities. Roads named Three Chain Road etc. persist today. The \\"Queen's Chain\\" is a concept that has long existed in New Zealand, of a strip of public land, usually 20 metres (or one chain in pre-metric measure) wide from the high water mark, that has been set aside for public use along the coast, around many lakes, and along all or part of many rivers. These strips exist in various forms (including road reserves, esplanade reserves, esplanade strips, marginal strips and reserves of various types) but not as extensively and consistently as is often assumed. Cricket pitches The chain also survives as the length of a cricket pitch, being the distance between the stumps. Measuring instruments Civil engineers and surveyors use various instruments (chains) for measuring distance. Other instruments used for measuring distance include tapes and bands. A steel band is also known as a \\"band chain\\".Types of Chains used in Surveying, Their Parts, Testing and Advantages Surveyors' chain (Gunter's chain)  In 1620, the polymath Edmund Gunter developed a method of accurately surveying land using a 100 link chain, 66 feet long called the Gunter's Chain. Other surveyors chains have been used historically.  Engineer's chain (Ramsden's chain) A longer chain of , with a hundred links, was devised in the UK in the late 18th century by Jesse Ramsden, though it never supplanted Gunter's chain. Surveyors also sometimes used such a device, and called it the engineer's chain.  or Texas chain In the Southwestern United States, the chain also called the Texas chain, of 20 (16.9164 m , or ft) was used in surveying Spanish and later Mexican land grants, such as the major Fisher‚ÄìMiller and Paisano Grants in Texas, several similarly large ones in New Mexico, and over 200 smaller in California. Metric chains Metric chains, of lengths 5 m, 10 m, 20 m and 30 m, are widely used in India. Tolerances are +/- 3 mm for 5 m and 10 m chains, +/- 5 mm for a 20 m chain, and +/- 8 mm for a 30 m chain.Bhavikatti, S. S. (2010). Surveying and levelling (Vol. 1). IK International Pvt Ltd. Revenue chain In India, a revenue chain with 16 links and of length is used in cadastral surveys.Instruments used in Surveying - Instruments Used for Measuring Distance Other instruments Also in North America, a variant of the chain is used in forestry for traverse surveys. This modern chain is a static cord (thin rope) 50 metres long, marked with a small tag at each metre, and also marked in the first metre every decimetre. When working in dense bush, a short axe or hatchet is commonly tied to the end of the chain, and thrown through the bush in the direction of the traverse. Another version used extensively in forestry and surveying is the hip-chain: a small box containing a string counter, worn on the hip. The user ties off the spooled string to a stake or tree and the counter tallies distance as the user walks away in a straight line. These instruments are available in both feet and metres.

On July 11, 2017 it was announced on the band's Facebook page that original frontman Jorge Herrera had officially retired from touring. As of July 2017, the band consists of members Jake Kolatis (Guitarist), Marc Meggers (Drums), Rick Lopez (Bass), and David Rodriguez (Vocals).  History   Early years (1990-1998)  The Casualties were formed in 1990, with original members Jorge Herrera (vocals), Hank (guitar), Colin Wolf (vocals), Mark Yoshitomi (bass) and Yureesh Hooker (drums). The members aimed to return to what they viewed as the \\"golden era\\" of street punk, embodied by bands such as The Exploited and Charged GBH which they believed had disappeared by 1985. During the early years, the lineup was fluid, with several changes. In early 1991 Hank left the band, to be replaced by Fred Backus on guitar to record Political Sin in March 1991 for the Benefit for Beer compilation. Soon more changes were in the works, with new guitarist Fred heading off to school. C Squat's Scott temporarily filled Fred's shoes until he returned a short time later. During this period, guitarist Hank filled in for a couple of shows, and Steve Distraught also played briefly with the group on second guitar. The Casualties stabilized long enough to record the first demo in the fall of 1991 and the 40 oz Casualty EP in the spring of 1992, and was building up a fan base in their hometown of New York City. At the end of 1992, Mark and Fred left the band and were replaced by Mike Roberts on bass and Jake Kolatis on the guitar, followed by the departure of Yureesh and Colin in 1994, to be replaced on drums by Shawn, while the band went down to a single vocalist. 1994 sees the recording of the 4 song EP, Drinking Is Our Way Of Life, however it would not be released. The songs would later appear on the Casualties \\"early years 1990-1995\\" CD in 1999. In 1995, the band's second release, the 4 track A Fuckin' Way Of Life E.P. was released on Eyeball Records. After recording A Fuckin' Way of Life, Shawn left the band, and Marc Eggers (nicknamed Meggers) of the Rivits became the regular drummer. The line-up of Jorge, Jake, Mike and Meggers continued until 1997. In 1996 the Casualties became the first American band to appear at the \\"Holidays in the Sun\\" Festival in London. 1997 saw the release of the band's debut album, For the Punx is released on Tribal War Records, and the band embarks on its first American tour with The Varukers. Mike (the bassist) left the band in 1998, to be replaced with Johnny Rosado, from The Krays. They released their second LP that year, Underground Army, and begin a world tour. Jon leaves the band during the European leg of the tour, to be temporarily replaced by Dave Punk Core.  Later years (1998-2017)  The Casualties live in Poland 2007 After the world tour, Dave would be replaced by Rick Lopez from the band Manix. The line-up was now solidified for the band, and would continue to the present day. The end of the millennium, 1999, saw the band produce a compilation album, Early Years 1990‚Äì1995, which included tracks which appeared on earlier ED's, as well as never before released songs, such as the four songs they had recorded on the never released EP Drinking is Our Way of Life back in 1994. The 2000s have seen the band to continue to tour and produce albums (an album list can be seen below). They have toured with several other bands, such as The Exploited, GBH, Cockney Rejects, Slaughter & the Dogs, and the English Dogs. In December 2009, The Casualties toured alongside Hatebreed, The Acacia Strain, Crowbar, and Thy Will Be Done as part of the Stillborn Fest. In the summer of 2012, The Casualties co-headlined the Tonight We Unite tour along with Nekromantix, where they played For The Punx in its entirety, the first time they had played the album through since its release in 1997. Later that year, The Casualties released their new album titled Resistance through Season of Mist. In 2013, The Casualties played at the largest punk rock festival in the world, the Rebellion Festival in Blackpool, England, where they shared the stage with The Exploited, Special Duties, Chron Gen and Anti-Establishment, and others. Chaos Sound, departure of Herrera, and new member (2016-present) On January 22, 2016, the band released their tenth studio album titled Chaos Sound. The album was recorded in Orange County, California at Buzzbomb Studio, produced by Paul Miner and released by Season Of Mist. It is the last album to feature original vocalist Jorge Herrera. In the second quarter of 2017, Herrera retired from touring amid multiple alleged claims of sexual assault. Frontman of The Krum Bums, David Rodriguez officially replaced Herrera, changing the band's line-up for the first time in 19 years. Guitarist Jake Kolatis and drummer Meggers are the two remaining long term members of the band.

It is a part of worship service in a Gurdwara (Sikh temple), daily rituals such as the opening the Guru Granth Sahib for prakash (morning light) or closing it for sukhasan (night bedroom) in larger Gurdwaras, closing of congregational worship in smaller Gurdwaras, rites-of-passages such as with the naming of child or the cremation of a loved one, daily prayer by devout Sikhs and any significant Sikh ceremonies. An Ardas consists of three parts. The first part recites the virtues of the ten Gurus of Sikhism from Guru Nanak to Guru Gobind Singh, starting with lines from Chandi di Var from the Dasam Granth. The second part recites the trials and triumphs of the Khalsa and petition. The third salutes the divine name. The first and the third part are set and cannot be changed, while the second part may vary, be shortened and include a supplication such as seeking divine help or blessing in dealing with daily problems, but is usually in agreed form. While it is sung, the audience or the Sikh devotee typically stands, with hands clasped in the folded namaste gesture, many with bowed headed, with some typically saying \\"Waheguru\\" after certain sections.Gurdwara, Encyclopaedia BritannicaMacAuliffe, 1909, p. 331 Ardas is attributed to Guru Gobind Singh, the founder of the Khalsa and the 10th Guru of Sikhism. Etymology The root of the word Ardas is related to the Sanskrit word ard (‡§Ö‡§∞‡•ç‡§¶) which means \\"request, ask, beg\\". It is also related to the Persian word arzdasht which means a written \\"petition made by an inferior to a superior\\". Structure The ArdƒÅs is usually always done standing up with folded hands and is commonly preceded by the eighth stanza of the fourth ashtapadi of the bani Sukhmani, beginning Tu Thakur Tum Peh Ardaas. It consists of three parts: #The beginning of the ArdƒÅs is strictly set by the tenth Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh and may not be altered or omitted. It appears as the opening passage of Var Sri Bhagauti Ji Ki (see Chandi di Var). The first part is an invocation from the Chandi di Var and recites the virtues of the Sikh Gurus. #The second part is several paragraphs recounting Sikh symbols, places or worship and values significant and related to Khalsa. This may be changed by reciting a \\"short ardaas\\". The Sikh devotee may include a personal prayer such as \\"Waheguru, please bless me in the task that I am about to undertake\\" when starting a new task, help me with this problem, or add any personal petition for God. #The third salutes the divine name. This part may also not be altered or omitted. The end of the Ardaas (Nanak Nam Chardi Kala, Tere Bhane Sarbat Da Bala, \\"O Nanak, may the Nam (Holy) be ever in ascendance! in Thy will may the good of all prevail!\\") is also set and may not be altered or omitted.SRM, p. 9. Origins The \\"ArdƒÅs\\" of Sikhism was first composed by Guru Gobind Singh. He fixed the first eight lines and the last section, and these are considered unalterable in Sikhism. The second section has been fluid, revised extensively and particularly by Tat Khalsa in the 20th century. The Sikh Rahit Maryada has published an approved version of the entire Ardas.

It often but not exclusively occurs on Sunday, or Saturday in the case of those churches practicing seventh-day Sabbatarianism. The church service is the gathering together of Christians to be taught the 'Word of God' (the Christian Bible) and encouraged in their faith. Technically, the \\"church\\" in \\"church service\\" refers to the gathering of the faithful rather than to the building in which it takes place. In most Christian traditions, services are presided over by clergy wherever possible. Styles of service vary greatly, from the Anglican, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Presbyterian, Roman Catholic, and Lutheran traditions of liturgical worship to the evangelical Protestant style, that often combines worship with teaching for the believers, which may also have an evangelistic component appealing to the non-Christians or skeptics in the congregation. Quakers and some other groups have no formal outline to their services, but allow the worship to develop as the participants present feel moved. From Jewish to Christian services The worship service is a practice of Christian life that has its origins in the Jewish worship.

Since the Apostles were originally Jews, see Jewish Christians, the concept of fixed hours for services, and services therefore which differed from weekday to Sabbath to holy day, were familiar to them. Pliny the Younger (63 - ca. 113), who was not a Christian himself, mentions not only fixed times of prayer by believers, but also specific services‚Äîother than the Eucharist‚Äîassigned to those times: \\"They met on a stated day before it was light, and addressed a form of prayer to Christ, as to a divinity ... after which it was their custom to separate, and then reassemble, to eat in common a harmless meal.\\"Pliny the Younger, Epistulae, Book X, Letter xcvii. The real evolution of the Christian service in the first century is shrouded in mystery. By the second and third centuries, such Church Fathers as Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and Tertullian wrote of formalised, regular services: the practice of Morning and Evening Prayer, and prayers at the third hour of the day (terce), the sixth hour of the day (sext), and the ninth hour of the day (none). With reference to the Jewish practices, it is surely no coincidence that these major hours of prayer correspond to the first and last hour of the conventional day, and that on Sundays (corresponding to the Sabbath in Christianity), the services are more complex and longer (involving twice as many services if one counts the Eucharist and the afternoon service). Similarly, the liturgical year from Christmas via Easter to Pentecost covers roughly five months, the other seven having no major services linked to the work of Christ. However, this is not to say that the Jewish services were copied or deliberately substituted, see Supersessionism. Contemporary church service A sermon, or homily, is an element of a church service. Today a wide variety of church services exist, from the long and elaborate services of Eastern Christianity to the very basic Evangelistic sermon. Though the majority of services are still conducted in church buildings designed specifically for that purpose, some services take place in \\"store front\\" or temporary settings. For those unable to attend a service in a church building a burgeoning televangelism and radio ministry provides broadcasts of services. A number of Websites have been set up as \\"cyber-churches\\" to provide a virtual worship space free to anyone on the Internet. Church services are often planned and led by a single pastor or a small group of elders or may follow a format laid out by the dictates of the denomination. Some churches are \\"lay led\\" with members of the congregation taking turns guiding the service or simply following format that has evolved over time between the active members. A few begin their church services with the ringing of a bell (or a number of bells). The service usually involves the singing of hymns, reading of scripture verses and possibly a psalm, and a sermon. If the church follows a lectionary, the sermon will often be about the scripture lections assigned to that day. Eucharistic churches have usually Holy Communion either every Sunday or several Sundays a month. Less liturgical congregations tend to place a greater emphasis on the sermon. Vocal music is traditionally sung by a choir or the congregation (or a mixture of the two), usually accompanied by an organ. Sometimes other instruments such as piano, classical instruments, or modern band instruments may be part of the service, especially in churches influenced by the contemporary worship movement. Some churches are equipped with state-of-the-art multi-media equipment to add to the worship experience. The congregation may sing along in hymnals or words to hymns and worship songs may be displayed on a screen. More liturgical denominations may have the words to specific prayers written in a missalette or prayer book, which the congregation follows. Many churches will take up a collection during the service. The rationale for this is taken from , , and . But some churches eschew this practice in favor of voluntary anonymous donations for which a box or plate may be set up by the entrance, or return-address envelopes may be provided that worshippers may take with them. Some churches offer Sunday school classes. These will often be for younger children, and may take place during the whole of the service (while the adults are in church), or the children may be present for the beginning of the service and at a prearranged point leave the service to go to Sunday school. Some churches have adult Sunday school either before or after the main worship service. Following the service, there will often be an opportunity for fellowship in the church hall or other convenient place. This provides the members of the congregation a chance to socialize with each other and to greet visitors or new members. Coffee or other refreshments may be served. Types of church service Mass at St. Maria Church, Sehnde A contemporary Sunday service at a Protestant church An evangelical church service Church services take many forms, and set liturgies may have different names. Services typically include: *Regular Sunday services. These are a part of most traditions. Holy Communion may be celebrated at some or all of these; often it is included either once a month or once a quarter. A few denominations have their main weekly services on Saturday rather than Sunday. Larger churches often tend to have several services each Sunday; often two or three in the morning and one or two in the late afternoon or evening. Some churches have begun to provide religious services conducted through internet technology. *Midweek services. Again, Holy Communion can be part of these, either on every occasion or on a regular basis. *Holiday services. Treated like a regular Sunday service, but made more specific for the day. *Weddings. These are normally separate services, rather than being incorporated into a regular service, but may be either. *Funerals. These are always separate services. *Baptisms. These may be incorporated into a regular service, or separate. *Confirmation. This is normally incorporated into a regular Sunday service, which will also include communion. It was traditionally the first Communion of the confirmee, but more recently, children are invited to communion in some denominations, whether confirmed or not. *Ordination of clergy. New bishops, elders, priests and deacons are usually ordained or installed generally in a solemn but celebratory ceremony on Saturday or Sunday generally open to the public either by their own superior or another approved senior minister with ordination powers either at the area headquarters church or the cathedral or another church agreed upon by those to be ordained and the ordaining ministers. Ordination of bishops or elders may require consecration by more than one individual and have a more limited audience. *First Communion. Children may celebrate Communion for the first time. *Opening of new churches or church buildings. *Dedication of new missionaries or those about to be sent on new missions. *Compline *Canonical hours *Divine Liturgy *Divine Service (Lutheran) *Evening Prayer (Anglican) *Easter Vigil *Mass (liturgy) *Morning Prayer (Anglican) *Worship service (evangelicalism) References See also *Worship service (evangelicalism) *Church attendance *Christian liturgy *Service As Worship External links Church Service: Nowadays Practice vs. First Century's Practice Christian worship and liturgy Christian behaviour and experience Christian terminology Weekly events ","title":"Church service"},{"id":"715094","text":"Sir Reginald Stephen Garfield Todd (13 July 1908 ‚Äì 13 October 2002) was a liberal Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia from 1953 to 1958 and later became an opponent of white minority rule in Rhodesia. Background Todd was born in Invercargill, New Zealand, in 1908. He was educated at Otago University, Glen Leith Theological College, and the University of the Witwatersrand.Sir Garfield Todd, Daily Telegraph, 14 October 2002 In 1932 he married Jean Grace Wilson, with whom he had three daughters. Todd emigrated to Southern Rhodesia from New Zealand in 1934 as a Protestant missionary and ran the Dadaya New Zealand Churches of Christ Mission school. One of the primary-school teachers in his charge was Robert Mugabe. Though he had no formal medical training, Todd and his wife, Grace, set up a clinic where he delivered hundreds of babies and treated minor injuries. His ranch, Hokonui, was named after the hills in his home province of Southland.A daughter of Southlanders, The Southland Times, January 31, 2009 Political involvement In 1948 Todd won election to the colonial parliament. He succeeded Sir Godfrey Martin Huggins as leader of the United Rhodesia Party and Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia in 1953 when Huggins became the inaugural Prime Minister of the newly established Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in 1953. At the same time the United Rhodesia Party became the United Federal Party. From 1955 to 1960 Todd served as first vice-president of the World Convention of Churches of Christ. Government Todd introduced modest reforms aimed at improving the education of the black majority by taking tax-money paid by Rhodesian property owners and appropriations from the British colonial authorities, and directing it toward black schools. His government introduced a plan to give elementary education to every African of school age. He doubled the number of primary schools and gave grants to missionary-run schools to introduce secondary school and pre-university courses for blacks. He also introduced the appellation \\"Mr\\" for blacks instead of \\"AM\\" (\\"African Male\\") and ended the prohibition on the sale of alcohol to black residents of the reserves, who were allowed to drink European beer and wine, though not spirits. Todd pushed a bill through the Legislative Assembly, allowing for multiracial trade unions, thereby undercutting the growing white nationalist influence in the unions. Lastly, in a bid to increase the number of blacks eligible to vote from 2% to 16% of the electorate, he moved to lower property and education qualifications, but this was rejected. In response, Todd's ministers resigned en bloc, and following the appointment of a new cabinet, his party forced him out of power; three months later he was replaced as party leader and Prime Minister by Edgar Whitehead.Sir Garfield Todd ‚Äì Liberal Rhodesian premier brought down over black reforms, The Guardian, 14 October 2002 In a farewell statement, he said \\"We must make it possible for every individual to lead the good life, to win a place in the sun. We are in danger of becoming a race of fear-ridden neurotics ‚Äì we who live in the finest country on Earth.\\"The Politics of Partnership, Patrick Keatley, Penguin Books, 1963, page 250 In addition to prime ministership, Todd was Minister of Finance on two occasions. Subsequent political career Todd formed the new Central Africa Party which failed to win any seats in the election. Out of power, Todd became increasingly critical of white minority rule and was an outspoken opponent of Ian Smith's 1965 Unilateral Declaration of Independence from the United Kingdom. Todd applied for an exit visa to lead a teach-in at the University of Edinburgh to educate British public opinion on the inequities of white rule. The Rhodesian government banned his emigration, placing him under house arrest. In 1972 Todd and his daughter, Judith, were imprisoned for a second time.Mugabe was rotten from the start Interview with Judith Todd discussing her political activities in Zimbabwe and her father, The Sunday Times, 23 September 2007 After publicly backing Roman Catholic Robert Mugabe, in 1973 he had received a medal for his efforts in peace and justice from the Pope. Judith Todd was ultimately forced into exile and became an \\"unperson\\" in Rhodesia when the media was banned from even mentioning her name.A detailed account of the Todds' time in prison may be found in Todd himself was confined to his ranch near Bulawayo. Later life After helping to co- ordinate the isolation and embargo of Rhodesia, and especially after his support for legitimising guerrilla activity by black nationalists, Todd was widely condemned as a traitor by white Rhodesians. When the Smith Government was ultimately forced to give up power and the nation became the independent state of Zimbabwe in 1980, Todd was immediately considered for appointment to the new black government for his \\"collaborating\\" role. Lord Soames, following the recommendation of Prime Minister-elect Robert Mugabe, appointed Todd to the Senate on 8 April 1980, where Todd served until his retirement in 1985. After years of supporting Mugabe, Todd became disillusioned with the new regime due to its blatant violence against political opponents. He was appointed a Knight Bachelor, for services to Africa and New Zealand, by Queen Elizabeth II in the 1986 New Year Honours, at the instigation of the New Zealand government. During retirement, Todd donated of his ranch to former guerillas who had been maimed in the Rhodesian Bush War. Nonetheless, Todd's criticism of Mugabe intensified and in 2002 he was stripped of Zimbabwean nationality. He died, aged 94, on 13 October 2002, in Bulawayo.
