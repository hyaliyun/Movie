He had a lifelong concern with human rights violations, first growing up in South Africa, later studying imprisonment in England and finally in Palestine. He founded the Centre for the Study of Human Rights at the London School of Economics. Life Cohen was born in Johannesburg, South Africa in 1942, son of a Lithuanian businessman. He grew up as a Zionist and intended to settle in Israel. He studied Sociology and Social Work as an undergraduate at the University of Witwatersrand, getting involved in anti- apartheid issues.Pioneers of Qualitative Research Stan Cohen UK Data Service, funded by the ESRC, Economic and Social Data Service, undated, retrieved 30 September 2015. He came to London in 1963, where he worked as a social worker, before completing his Ph.D at London School of Economics (LSE) about the social reactions to juvenile delinquency. The Mods and Rockers youth riots were then occurring at England's southern seaside towns, which he studied in the sensational press reactions and by direct interviews. From 1967, he lectured sociology briefly at the Enfield College, NE London, and then at Durham University. During this time of the student rebellions of 1968 he was influenced by the anti-psychiatry movement and participated in the National Deviancy Symposium. A project in Durham prison with Laurie Taylor (sociologist) from York, led to their publication of three books, namely Psychological Survival: The Experience of Long-term Imprisonment (1972), Escape Attempts (1976), Prison Secrets (1978) and the later Visions of Social Control: Crime, Punishment and Classification (1985) which Cohen wrote alone. From 1972 until 1980 he worked as Professor of Sociology at the University of Essex. In 1980, he moved with his family to Israel, where he became the Director of the Institute of Criminology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He worked with human rights organisations campaigning against torture and dealing with the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. He returned to England in 1996 after having been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and was appointed Martin White Professor of Sociology at LSE, where he worked until retirement in 2005. In 1998 Cohen was elected a fellow of the British Academy. In 2003, he received an honorary doctorate from University of Essex and in 2008 from Middlesex University. In 2009 he was the first recipient of an Outstanding Achievement Award from the British Society of Criminology. He died on 7 January 2013 from consequences of Parkinson's disease. Work Cohen was a leading writer on Criminology and Sociology. Folk Devils and Moral Panic (1972) Cohen's 1972 study (Folk Devils and Moral Panics) of the UK popular media and social reaction to the Mods and Rockers phenomenon is widely regarded by British criminologists as one of the most influential works in the field in the last forty years. The work applied the concepts of labelling, societal reactionWilkins, L.T. (1964) Social Deviance: Social Policy, Action, and Research. London: Tavistock and the notion of the Deviancy Amplification Spiral. It helped to shift the focus of Criminology away from the causes of crime towards social reaction, the sociology of crime and Social Control. Cohen suggested the media overreact to an aspect of behaviour which may be seen as a challenge to existing social norms. However, the media response and representation of that behaviour actually helps to define it, communicate it and portrays it as a model for outsiders to observe and adopt. So the moral panic by society represented in the media arguably fuels further socially unacceptable behaviour.Hopkins Burke, R. (2001) An Introduction to Criminological Theory, Cullompton: Willan pg.154 Although Cohen is credited with coining the term moral panic the term is quite old - for instance an early usage can be found in the Quarterly Christian Spectator in 1830The Quarterly Christian Spectator: Conducted by an Association of Gentlemen (1830) Vol. II. A. H. Maltby. New Haven/ New York and it was used by the Canadian communications theorist Marshall McLuhan in 1964.McLuhan, Marshall (1994). Understanding media: the extensions of man. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press. States of Denial (2001) Cohen's last book States of Denial: Knowing about Atrocities and Suffering attempts to analyze personal and political ways in which humans avoid uncomfortable realities, like poverty, suffering, injustice. In 11 chapters he examines elementary forms of denial, Knowing and Not-Knowing: The Psychology of Denial (How could people simultaneously know and not know about such matters?), Denial at Work: Mechanisms and Rhetorical Devices, Accounting for Atrocities: Perpetrators and Officials, Blocking Out the Past: Personal Memories, Public Histories, Bystander States (Though ignorance is bliss, to what extent is a bystander a perpetrator?, Images of Suffering, Appeals: Outrage Into Action, Digging Up Graves, Opening Wounds: Acknowledging the Past, Acknowledgement Now (societal and personal transformation) and concludes with Loose Ends.States of Denial: Knowing about Atrocities and Suffering Polity Book details, undated, retrieved 30 September 2015 The book has been highly praised by reviewers in the English speaking world. The Guardian wrote, \\"He leads the reader to the conclusion that it is denial that is 'normal' and an ability to see the truth and act accordingly which is rare, whether in individuals or in governments.\\" Michael Ignatieff said \\"this book will become the starting point for all future debate on the subject\\". ; States of Denial is an influential book on how people are in denial about racial oppression, slavery and other suffering. Cohen explains how many people, throughout this country, know that racial oppressive acts occur yet deny it. He writes how it seems as if these people only want to signify and realize things that they want, not actual reality. He says that people do know yet do not know that there is suffering and oppression, as if they choose to ignore it rather than talk about such an uneasy topic. Many people assume, and sometimes witness these acts occur, yet when asked will deny anything ever happened. Stanley Cohen writes about how people act blind to reality, due to uncomfortable and uneasy topics. According to Cohen, many people are in touch with the fact that racial oppression still occurs, along with other acts of human suffering, yet deny that those actions happen. The topic of racial oppression being such an uncomfortable topic makes it hard for many to acknowledge that it actually happens to this day. Stanley Cohen's point of the book is to bring awareness to those who do not see the truth being mass incarceration and how society is structured. He wants people to realize how much people choose to ignore in society today, and that it needs to change. Personal life In 1963, Cohen married Ruth Kretzmer. She died in 2003; As of 2013, they were survived by their two daughters Judith and Jessica. Laurie Taylor commented on his personality this way: \\"He could be cruel about the pedants and time-servers he met along the way, intolerant of those who modified their political principles as they gained promotion.\\" Cohen's love of jokes and self-depreciating humor is exemplified in an anecdote when Taylor mentioned cutting down drinking during their next academic collaboration, like Richard Burton, who said that he \\"could see the world as it really was\\", to which Cohen replied \\"That's all very well, but who the hell wants to see the world as it really is?\\".

Traditionally consisting of soft wheat egg noodles served in a hot dashi garnished with diced green onions and a thin slice of kamaboko, modern versions of saimin include additional toppings such as char siu, sliced Spam, sliced egg, or shredded nori. When Chinese dumplings are added to the noodle soup, it is seen on menus as the heartier wonton min. All saimin establishments have their own, often secret recipe for the soup base, but primarily use kombu and dried shrimp as major ingredients. Common table condiments mixed in the saimin broth are Chinese hot mustard and shoyu, added in small quantities according to each individual's taste. Many local residents of Hawaii also enjoy barbecued teriyaki beef sticks (skewers) or American hamburgers as a side dish. Saimin was developed during Hawaii's plantation era and is a testament to the history of cultural influences found in the Hawaiian Islands. It is a local comfort food eaten all year round at any time of day for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or as a late-night snack. Initially consumed by the working class, saimin can now be seen on the menus of Hawaii's restaurants from fast food chains to upscale five-star hotel restaurants. It is commonly eaten at sporting events as well, with concession stands offering the hot noodle soup alongside popcorn and nachos. Saimin is also available as a pre- cooked packaged food much like instant ramen. History Etymology 'Saimin' is a compound of two Chinese words: (pinyin: x√¨, jyutping: sai3), meaning thin, and (mi√†n, min6), meaning noodle. Although the term saimin itself is accepted to have Chinese origins, residents of China would not recognize the written word. The first recorded use of the romanized word in Hawaii dates as far back as 1908, but was most likely spoken in the local dialect much earlier. In Hawaii's contemporary pidgin language, saimin has become a hyponym or blanket term for noodle soups, particularly instant ramen (e.g., \\"And one day, I come home from school and Blu and Maisie are eating dry saimin sprinkled with the soup stock\\"). Origin The precise origins of this noodle soup as a dish is debatable. It is certain that saimin, along with much of the contemporary cuisine in Hawaii, is closely related to the immigration of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Filipino, and Portuguese field workers during the plantation era of Hawaii beginning in the 1850s. As the popular belief goes, these plantation laborers of various ethnic backgrounds would return from the fields and share communal meals. For example, a Filipino family may have had extra green onions growing in their yard, the Portuguese would have some extra pork from making sausage, the Chinese would share some noodles, while the Japanese provide some dashi for the meal. At this point, they would all throw their ingredients into a pot and share what was created. It may be through these improvised communal meals that saimin was possibly born. This common, yet supposed history of saimin's origins is highly debatable since there are recorded accounts of much racial tension between the various ethnic groups during this time. Interracial activity was highly limited and the groups were more than often segregated, leaving little chance for these imagined communal meals. Among the immigrant population in Hawaii, one of the largest (besides the Chinese) and most influential (besides the Caucasian) immigrants were the Japanese and it is theorized that saimin was created by this ethnic group wanting to eat ramen. Instead of a full replication, they were limited to the ingredients readily available to them in Hawaii, resulting in the creation of saimin. There are also records of Japanese immigrants peddling saimin in Hawaii as early as 1915, giving them a decent standing as its fore-bearer. But the Japanese ramen theory has some complications. During the same time period, ramen was not the widely popular phenomenon in Japan as it is known today and would not be considered a food Japanese immigrants immediately associate with their homeland. To drive this point further, if indeed Japanese immigrants were attempting to recreate ramen in Hawaii, the common Japanese language did not use the word ramen („É©„Éº„É°„É≥) until about the 1950s. In Japan it was first known as shina soba (ÊîØÈÇ£„Åù„Å∞), literally 'Chinese soba'. Saimin noodles themselves are closer in characteristic to the curly yellow-colored Chinese egg noodles found in wonton noodles as opposed to the straight white wheat noodles consumed in Japan, giving Chinese immigrants an edge as the first developers of saimin. Many newspaper clippings of Hawaii's yesteryears mentioning saimin are exclusively associated with the Chinese population and their neighborhoods. Majority of these associations are also subtly derogatory, suggesting a less desirable, low-class representation of their community. That being so, it may become a sensitive issue crediting Chinese immigrants with saimin's origins even with strong written evidence behind this theory. Whichever the case, the clash of cultures in Hawaii makes it difficult to precisely pinpoint the exact beginning of saimin, but in turn makes this dish completely unique with roots set deeply in Hawaii's history. Initial Appearance Saimin was first sold as a menu item in the early 1900s from unmarked and unnamed ‚Äòsaimin wagons‚Äô as ‚Äúan immigrant family‚Äôs first step into American entrepreneurship‚Äù. The noodles, broth, and toppings were made from scratch and prepared by hand in their homes. With all the components ready to assemble and serve, they would wheel out to a spot wherever there were plantation laborers looking for a cheap and quick bite to eat. As these families earned more money, they were able to set up shop at fixed locations. The first of these saimin stands could be found near the old plantation towns and farms of Hawaii as early as the 1930s, feeding hungry fieldworkers for as little as $0.05 a bowl. Post- plantation Popularization As Hawaii gradually moved from an agricultural economy towards a more service based economy in the 1960s and 70s, saimin stands moved away from the plantation fields with many more establishments opening near sporting venues, movie theaters, pool halls, and schools. Due to its timely preparation and warm broth, it became popular as a quick late night snack for young adults after a night out on the town. Perceived as a healthy alternative to most school meals, several public schools throughout Hawaii began offering saimin as a regular option for students who did not want to eat the scheduled weekly menu. It was not until the opening of Honolulu Stadium and its addition to the concession stand's menu when saimin became acknowledged as a popular fast food and put under a national spotlight. Chuck Tanner, retired Major League Baseball player for the Boston Braves and former manager of minor league baseball team the Hawaii Islanders in 1969 and 1970, recalled, ‚ÄúDuring the games, fans ate corn on the cob. They had some soup. . . won ton or something. I don‚Äôt know. And they had these sticks with beef on them.‚Äù Modern Period Saimin became less popular in the 1980s and 90s as the appearance of other exciting noodle soup dishes made their way to Hawaii such as tonkotsu ramen and pho. Since then, many saimin institutions turned off their stoves for good, leaving saimin as a comfort food of nostalgic value to the older generation in Hawaii. Historic Saimin Establishments Several saimin establishments including saimin noodle factories and restaurants have become local landmarks in Hawaii and have attracted out-of- state visitors venturing off the traditional tourist-beaten paths. There are many that have closed their doors such as Shiroma's Saimin in Waipahu, Washington Saimin in Makiki, Hall Saimin in Kalihi, and most recently Likelike Drive In. Some historic local institutions still in existence are Dillingham Saimin (formally known as Boulevard Saimin), Palace Saimin, Shiro's Saimin Haven, and Sekiya's Restaurant & Delicatessen on Oahu. Also notable are Nori's Saimin & Snacks on the Big Island, Sam Sato's on Maui, and Hamura's Saimin on Kauai, which was given the James Beard Foundation's America's Classic honor in 2006. McDonald's Saimin A serving of McDonald's Saimin. McDonald's, an American fast-food giant based in Oak Brook, Illinois became aware of the saimin phenomenon in the Hawaiian islands in the late 1960s. Maurice J. \\"Sully\\" Sullivan, legendary Hawaii entrepreneur and owner of Foodland Super Market Limited, had purchased and opened the first McDonald's restaurant in Hawaii in 1968 at his flagship grocery store. He opened several more McDonald's franchises, and for 12 straight months, McDonald's Hawaii became the highest-grossing group of franchises in the world. Sullivan wanted to serve his favorite meal, saimin, at his McDonald's restaurants, knowing all too well that his restaurants would boom with its introduction to the menu. Sullivan invited executives from the McDonald's corporation, including owner and business tycoon Ray Kroc for dinner at two family-owned, \\"hole-in-the- wall\\" saimin stands in Honolulu: Washington Saimin and Boulevard Saimin. That night, Sullivan convinced Kroc to expand McDonald's menu for the first time in its corporate history to include a local \\"ethnic\\" food. Researchers worked extensively with Washington Saimin to develop a recipe for McDonald's Hawaii. Sullivan secured deals with Ajinomoto, a local Japanese saimin noodle factory and fishcake supplier, to manufacture a special soup base. Today, saimin is one of McDonald's Hawaii restaurant's most popular menu items. Later, Sullivan introduced breakfast platters consisting of Portuguese sausage, eggs, and steamed white rice; Spam, eggs, and rice; and a Breakfast deluxe, a combination of the two, to his menu, capitalizing on the local food phenomena. S&S; Saimin Much like its close counterpart ramen, saimin was also developed as an instant noodle in 1963 by Shimoko & Sons saimin brand, better known to locals as S&S; saimin. Unlike instant ramen, S&S; saimin noodles require refrigeration or freezing and are not dry. The noodles are also pre- cooked, making it a ready-to-eat food by simply adding hot water with a soup base packaged separately. Instant saimin has since become a staple in many Hawaii households because of its quick and easy preparation, in addition allowing the consumer to add any toppings they desire. S&S; is a large contributor to popularizing saimin since the name brand sponsored many local television shows between the late 1960s and early 1980s. During this time, S&S; sent 20 children to Disneyland through a contest held with the beloved children's program, The Checkers and Pogo Show. The saimin brand also sponsored the \\"S&S; Junk Show\\", a karaoke-based amateur singing program which ran for 15 seasons. S&S; saimin brand was acquired by the Japanese multinational drink company Ito En in 1987. The brand was later sold to Hawaii-based noodle and pasta manufacturer Sun Noodle in 2006. Variations Some saimin establishments may have the option to substitute the traditional thin egg noodles for the thicker udon noodle, or sometimes mixing both, creating something seen on local menus as saidon. A soup-less pan-fried version similar to Japanese yakisoba and Chinese lo mein is simply known as fried saimin. This variation is particularly popular at carnivals, fairgrounds, and catered parties since it can be prepared in large quantities and consumed at room temperature. Fried saimin is also served as a side dish in okazuya bento and plate lunch.

Even throughout the season, Brown struggled because of the racism endemic in his new surroundings, as he hit .179 in just 21 games between July 19 and August 21 before he was released. Later career That winter, Brown went to Puerto Rico and had one of his greatest seasons ever, batting .432 with 27 home runs and 86 RBI in just 60 games, winning the Triple Crown and earning the nickname Ese Hombre or \\"That Man\\". He then won the Puerto Rican Winter League Triple Crown in the 1949‚Äì1950 season, and also hit for the cycle once in his career. Returning to the Monarchs for the 1948 season and stayed with the team until his retirement from top-level baseball in . Subsequently, he was a successful minor league player in the Texas League from through . His career home run total is not known, but he is considered to be among the Negro league career leaders in homers despite a relatively brief career.  Later life and legacy  After retiring from baseball, Brown was a long time resident of Houston, Texas, where he died in 1996 at the age of 81. He had been suffering from Alzheimer's disease for several years.

Walkers, owned by PepsiCo, purchased the Quavers brand in July 1995, when it became one of the Frito Lay International brand names. Quavers were launched in 1968 with the advertising slogan \\"you get a lovely lot of Quavers in a bag\\". Packaging described them as \\"curly potato puffs\\".Opie, Robert The 1970s Scrapbook In October 1998, Prawn Cocktail Quavers was introduced to both Cheese and Salt & Vinegar flavours, replacing Tangy Tomato. \\"NEW PRAWN COCKTAIL\\" was said inside multipack bags. In March 1999, Quavers was re-introduced again, which were called \\"New Cheese Flavour,\\" \\"Salt & Vinegar Flavour\\" and \\"Prawn Cocktail Flavour.\\" In February 2007, Walkers changed the packaging for all their snack products, which were Quavers, Wotsits, Squares, French Fries and Monster Munch. This packaging reflected the usage of Sunseed Oil, which was used in all products. The Multipack bags were in a different layout, being in Landscape style. Quavers' logo was changed slightly, and the flavours remained the same. In December 2009, Quavers, Squares, Wotsits and French Fries had all changed their packaging again because of a reduction in calories. Quavers has 87 calories in the Cheese flavour. In February 2011, Quavers packaging updated to a brighter bag colour with the Walkers logo on the packets again.  Ingredients  Quavers are currently only available in Cheese flavour, but have had many other varieties over the years. The primary ingredient in Quavers is potato starch. They are deep fried to give a snack with a similar texture to krupuk (prawn crackers), but have a different flavour and are smaller with a curled-up rectangle shape (similar in cross-section to a quaver). Originally only available in cheese and smoky bacon flavours, the product line went on to introduce two other flavours, prawn cocktail and salt and vinegar. These were discontinued in 2012. Ketchup and sweet and sour flavours were also introduced, but for a limited time only and are no longer available.

The measure is defined as the ratio of two standard deviations representing these types of variation. The context here is the same as that of the intraclass correlation coefficient, whose value is the square of the correlation ratio. Definition Suppose each observation is yxi where x indicates the category that observation is in and i is the label of the particular observation. Let nx be the number of observations in category x and :\\\\overline{y}_x=\\\\frac{\\\\sum_i y_{xi}}{n_x} and \\\\overline{y}=\\\\frac{\\\\sum_x n_x \\\\overline{y}_x}{\\\\sum_x n_x}, where \\\\overline{y}_x is the mean of the category x and \\\\overline{y} is the mean of the whole population. The correlation ratio Œ∑ (eta) is defined as to satisfy :\\\\eta^2 = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_x n_x (\\\\overline{y}_x-\\\\overline{y})^2}{\\\\sum_{x,i} (y_{xi}-\\\\overline{y})^2} which can be written as :\\\\eta^2 = \\\\frac{{\\\\sigma_{\\\\overline{y}}}^2}{{\\\\sigma_{y}}^2}, \\\\text{ where }{\\\\sigma_{\\\\overline{y}}}^2 = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_x n_x (\\\\overline{y}_x-\\\\overline{y})^2}{\\\\sum_x n_x} \\\\text{ and } {\\\\sigma_{y}}^2 = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{x,i} (y_{xi}-\\\\overline{y})^2}{n}, i.e. the weighted variance of the category means divided by the variance of all samples. If the relationship between values of x and values of \\\\overline{y}_x is linear (which is certainly true when there are only two possibilities for x) this will give the same result as the square of Pearson's correlation coefficient; otherwise the correlation ratio will be larger in magnitude. It can therefore be used for judging non-linear relationships. Range The correlation ratio \\\\eta takes values between 0 and 1. The limit \\\\eta=0 represents the special case of no dispersion among the means of the different categories, while \\\\eta=1 refers to no dispersion within the respective categories. \\\\eta is undefined when all data points of the complete population take the same value. Example Suppose there is a distribution of test scores in three topics (categories): *Algebra: 45, 70, 29, 15 and 21 (5 scores) *Geometry: 40, 20, 30 and 42 (4 scores) *Statistics: 65, 95, 80, 70, 85 and 73 (6 scores). Then the subject averages are 36, 33 and 78, with an overall average of 52. The sums of squares of the differences from the subject averages are 1952 for Algebra, 308 for Geometry and 600 for Statistics, adding to 2860. The overall sum of squares of the differences from the overall average is 9640. The difference of 6780 between these is also the weighted sum of the squares of the differences between the subject averages and the overall average: :5 (36-52)^2 + 4 (33-52)^2 +6 (78-52)^2 = 6780. This gives :\\\\eta^2 = \\\\frac{6780}{9640}=0.7033\\\\ldots suggesting that most of the overall dispersion is a result of differences between topics, rather than within topics. Taking the square root gives :\\\\eta = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{6780}{9640}}=0.8386\\\\ldots. For \\\\eta = 1 the overall sample dispersion is purely due to dispersion among the categories and not at all due to dispersion within the individual categories. For quick comprehension simply imagine all Algebra, Geometry, and Statistics scores being the same respectively, e.g. 5 times 36, 4 times 33, 6 times 78. The limit \\\\eta = 0 refers to the case without dispersion among the categories contributing to the overall dispersion. The trivial requirement for this extreme is that all category means are the same. Pearson v. Fisher The correlation ratio was introduced by Karl Pearson as part of analysis of variance. Ronald Fisher commented: > As a descriptive statistic the utility of the correlation ratio is extremely > limited. It will be noticed that the number of degrees of freedom in the > numerator of \\\\eta^2 depends on the number of the arraysRonald Fisher (1926) > Statistical Methods for Research Workers, (excerpt) to which Egon Pearson (Karl's son) responded by saying > Again, a long-established method such as the use of the correlation ratio > [¬ß45 The \\"Correlation Ratio\\" Œ∑] is passed over in a few words without > adequate description, which is perhaps hardly fair to the student who is > given no opportunity of judging its scope for himself.Pearson E.S.

Varah ‚Äì 8 November 2007) was a British Anglican priest and social activist from England. In 1953, he founded the Samaritans, the world's first crisis hotline, to provide telephone support to those contemplating suicide. Life Varah was born in the town of Barton-upon- Humber, Lincolnshire, the eldest of nine children of the vicar at the Anglican church of St Peter. His father, Canon William Edward Varah, a strict Tractarian, named him after St Chad, who, according to Bede, had founded the 7th-century monastery ad Bearum (\\"at Barrow\\"), which may have occupied an Anglo-Saxon enclosure next to Barton Vicarage. He was educated at Worksop College in north Nottinghamshire and won an exhibition to study natural sciences at Keble College, Oxford, quickly switching to Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE). He was involved in the university Russian and Slavonic clubs and was founder-president of the Scandinavian Club. He graduated with a third-class degree in 1933. Clerical career Varah was initially reluctant to follow his father's vocation, but his godfather persuaded him to study at Lincoln Theological College, where he was taught by the Revd Michael Ramsey, later Archbishop of Canterbury. He was ordained deacon in the Church of England in 1935 and priest in 1936. He first served as curate at St Giles, Lincoln, from 1935 to 1938, then at St Mary's, Putney, from 1938 to 1940 and Barrow-in-Furness from 1940 to 1942. He became vicar of Holy Trinity, Blackburn, in 1942 and moved to St Paul, Battersea, in 1949. He was also chaplain of St John's Hospital, Battersea. The Grocers' Company offered him the living of St Stephen Walbrook in 1953. He became rector of the church, designed by Christopher Wren, adjacent to the Mansion House in the City of London. The church was closed for structural repairs from 1978 to 1987. His son, Andrew, built chairs to replace its pews. Great controversy followed the installation of a large circular altar in travertine marble by Henry Moore, commissioned by Varah and his churchwarden Peter Palumbo. The matter was finally settled by the Court of Ecclesiastical Causes Reserved in 1987, which granted a retrospective faculty for its installation.[1987] Fam 146, [1987] 2 All ER 578 He was a supporter of women priests, but preferred the liturgy of the Book of Common Prayer. Despite the absence of a permanent congregation, the church remained popular for weddings. He officiated at the marriage of Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones, only daughter of Princess Margaret, to actor Daniel Chatto in 1994. He was made an honorary prebendary of St Paul's Cathedral in 1975, becoming senior prebendary in 1997. He retired in 2003, aged 92, by which time he was the oldest incumbent in the Church of England. Samaritans Varah began to understand the problems facing the suicidal when he was taking a funeral as an assistant curate in 1935, his first church service, for a fourteen-year-old girl who had taken her own life because she had begun to menstruate and feared that she had a sexually transmitted disease. He later said \\"Little girl, I didn't know you, but you have changed the rest of my life for good.\\" He vowed at that time to encourage sex education, and to help people who were contemplating suicide and had nowhere to turn. To that end, Chad Varah founded the Samaritans in 1953 in the crypt of his church, with the stated aim that it would be an organisation \\"to befriend the suicidal and despairing.\\" The phone line, MAN 9000 (for MANsion House), received its first call on 2 November 1953, and the number of calls increased substantially after publicity in the Daily Herald on 7 December 1953. He was director of the central London branch of Samaritans until 1974, and president from 1974 to 1986. He was also founder chairman of Befrienders Worldwide (Samaritans International) from 1974 to 1983, and then its president from 1983 to 1986. Break with Samaritans Later in life, Chad Varah became disillusioned with the Samaritans organisation. He announced in 2004 that, \\"It's no longer what I founded. I founded an organisation to offer help to suicidal or equally desperate people. The last elected chairman re-branded the organisation. It was no longer to be an emergency service. It was to be an emotional support\\".Anthony J. Jordan. The Good Samaritans, Memoir of a Biographer pp. 7‚Äì20. Westport Books 2010. . Other works He was also closely associated with the founding of the comic The Eagle by fellow clergyman Marcus Morris in 1950. He supplemented his income by working as a scriptwriter for The Eagle and its sister publications Girl, Robin and Swift until 1961. He used his scientific education to be \\"Scientific and Astronautical Consultant\\" (as Varah put it) to Dan Dare. In line with a long- standing commitment to sex education, he was a member of the board of reference of the British edition of the adult magazine 'Forum' from 1967 to 1987. He was patron of the Terrence Higgins Trust from 1987 to 1999 and an original patron of the Cult Information Centre. He wrote a television play, Nobody Understands Miranda, which was broadcast by the BBC as part of a six- part series about the Samaritans in 1972. He continued his campaigning work into his later life, founding Men Against Genital Mutilation of Girls (MAGMOG) in 1992, and publishing his autobiography, Before I Die Again, referring to his interest in reincarnation, the same year. Honours and awards Reverend Chad Varah was awarded the Albert Schweitzer Gold Medal in 1972, and became an Honorary Fellow of Keble College in 1981. He held several honorary doctorates, and was awarded the Romanian Patriarchal Cross. He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1961 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre. He was appointed OBE in 1969, and advanced to CBE in 1995. He was created a Companion of Honour in 2000.

Bras d'Or Lake is an inland sea, or large body of partially fresh/salt water in the centre of Cape Breton Island in the province of Nova Scotia, Canada. Bras d'Or Lake is sometimes referred to as the Bras d'Or Lakes or the Bras d'Or Lakes system; however, its official geographic name is Bras d'Or Lake, as it is a singular entity. Canadian author and yachtsman Silver Donald Cameron describes Bras d'Or Lake as \\"A basin ringed by indigo hills laced with marble. Islands within a sea inside an island.\\" The lake is connected to the North Atlantic by natural channels; the Great Bras d'Or Channel north of Boularderie Island and the Little Bras d'Or Channel to south of Boularderie Island connect the northeastern arm of the lake to the Cabot Strait. The Bras d'Or is also connected to the Atlantic Ocean via the Strait of Canso by means of a lock canal completed in 1869‚Äîthe St. Peters Canal, at the southern tip of the lake. There are several competing explanations of the origin of the name \\"Bras d'Or\\". The most popular is that the first Europeans to discover and subsequently settle the area were French, naming the lake Bras d'Or, meaning \\"arm of gold\\"; this likely referring to the sun's rays reflected upon its waters. However, on the maps of 1872 and earlier, the lake is named \\"Le Lac de Labrador\\" (or more simply \\"Labrador\\"), and this is more likely the true derivation of the present name. The literal meaning of Labrador is \\"Laborer.\\" A 1922 edition of Place-Names of the Province of Nova Scotia quotes a paper by a Dr. Patterson prepared for the Nova Scotia Historical Society, referring to his analysis that the name Bras d'Or came from the Breton form of Bras 'd'eau, literally an \\"arm of water\\", as it is an arm of the sea. The Mi'kmaq Nation named it Pitu'pok, roughly translated as \\"long salt water\\". An excellent review of this subject is given on page 93 and 94 of a work by J.G. Bourinot who was the President of the Royal Society of Canada.J.G Bourinot, Historical and Descriptive Account of the Island of Cape Breton, W. Foster Brown & Co., Montreal, 1892. Covering an area of approximately Bras d'Or Lake measures roughly in length and width. The maximum depth is in the St. Andrews Channel. Surrounded almost entirely by high hills and low mountains, the lake is dominated by the Washabuck Peninsula in the centre-west, Boularderie Island in the northeast, and a large peninsula extending from the centre-east dominated by the Boisdale Hills. The Washabuck Peninsula and Boisdale Hills divide the lake into northern and southern basins, linked by the 1 km wide Barra Strait. This area was designated the Bras d'Or Lake Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 2011.  Subdivisions  Ocean- going ships enter and exit the Bras d'Or Lake system via Great Bras d'Or, spanned by the Seal Island Bridge The effect of local topography has resulted in the following major components of Bras d'Or Lake: Northern Basin * Great Bras d'Or * Little Bras d'Or * St. Andrews Channel * St. Patricks Channel * Baddeck Bay * Nyanza Bay * Whycocomagh Bay Southern Basin * Denys Basin * St. Peters Inlet * East Bay * West Bay The largest part of the lake measures approximately 25 kilometres across in the southern basin, framed by East Bay and West Bay with Denys Basin to the north and St. Peters Inlet to the south. The Barra Strait is crossed by highway and railway bridges running between the Washabuck Peninsula and the Boisdale Hills.  Rivers  The following major rivers empty into the lake (which can also be defined as an inland sea, or a gulf): * River Denys * Middle River * Baddeck River * Skye River * Georges River * Washabuck River The restricted tidal exchange in its three points of contact with the Atlantic ocean, coupled with significant freshwater drainage from the many rivers and streams in the lake watershed, cause the lake water to have less salinity than the surrounding ocean. Although salinity varies throughout the lake system, it approximates a one third fresh, two-thirds sea water mixture, and hence may be termed brackish water. Without much exchange with the ocean outside the island, the lake water quality is threatened by runoff from human activities in the surrounding watershed, especially from sewage treatment plants and septic tanks, ocean-going ships and small craft plying the lake system. Partly for this reason, the lakes were designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.  Wildlife  Bras d'Or Lake is home to an array of wildlife with successful lobster and oyster fisheries, as well as the pursuit of other marine species. The lake's largely undeveloped shorelines have resulted in significant concentrations of bald eagle populations.  Boating  A renowned summer vacation destination, the area around the Bras d'Or Lake has become popular with recreational boaters. As the majority of cruising vessels enter the lake from the south via Lennox Passage and the St. Peters Canal, St. Peter's Lion's Club Marina located in Strachan's Cove (about 900 metres west of the Canal) in St. Peter's, Nova Scotia is the generally the first port of call for boats entering the lake. St. Peters Marina is one of the largest marinas in the Bras d'Or and has full boating services. Baddeck is home to two marinas, two full service boatyards and the Bras d'Or Yacht Club. Ben Eoin, in the East Bay, has a 75-slip marina with full services which opened in May 2013. The community operated Barra Strait Marina in Grand Narrows reopened in 2012. The East Bay Regatta, held the last weekend in July since 1984, features races and other social events. As many as 40 boats participate. Sailboat racing is a long tradition in the Bras d'Or, with the various yacht clubs around lake hosting annual Regattas and race weeks. Regatta Week hosted by the Bras d'Or Yacht Club has been an annual tradition for over 100 years. The East Bay Regatta, held the last weekend in July since 1984, features races and other social events. In some years as many as 40 boats participate. Boats and crews at the start of Race the Cape 2013 at St. Peter's Lion's Club Marina Race the Cape was a point-to-point sail race of 175 nautical miles, broken into five legs of up to 40 nautical miles through the Bras d‚ÄôOr Lake and along Cape Breton Island's Atlantic coast leading north to the Cape Breton Highlands. Race the Cape was an International Sailing Federation ‚Äì Off Shore Special Regulations (OSR) Category 4 Race, for both cruising boats and racing yachts. There were both Spinnaker and Non-Spinnaker Divisions. The last RTC Regatta was held in 2017. While there are more than 20 launch ramps for trailered boats spread throughout the lake, they are scarce outside the lake villages. The heavily indented shoreline of the lake system, bold shores and numerous protected coves and harbours with snug anchorages provide shelter and keep wave action small, resulting in the lake being known as one of the best sailing waters in North America. Ocean-going ships presently enter the lake at the Great Bras d'Or and via the St. Patricks Channel to a gypsum quarry at Little Narrows. Before construction of the Trans-Canada Highway and other roadways, ships and boats plied the Bras d'Or Lake carrying coal, gypsum, marble, agricultural and forestry products from Cape Breton to the outside world, via barge through the St. Peters Canal to destinations along the Atlantic coast of North America. In addition, some products ‚Äì like marble quarried into the early 20th century at Marble Mountain, were shipped by lake barges through both lakes to Sydney for transshipment. Mail boats also ran on scheduled service across the lakes until the 1960s, providing connecting passenger service to the train at Iona.  Lakeside development  The largest communities located on Bras d'Or Lake are the villages of Baddeck, Eskasoni, Little Bras d'Or, St. Peter's, and Whycocomagh. Remaining parts of lake shorelines are largely rural with some farming, although encroaching urban sprawl from Sydney in the Cape Breton Regional Municipality (CBRM) is approaching East Bay. Many cottage and recreational properties are located in rural areas, largely owned by people from Sydney, Halifax, or from out of province. There is little significant protection for shorelines from development in the form of designated parks or conservation areas. In addition, Nova Scotia does not provide much protection of rural areas from subdivision of property. Despite this, most of the shoreline is undeveloped. Passenger steamer on Bras d'Or Lake near New Campbellton, ca 1903. Until modern roads were built in the 20th century, coastal freighters/steamships would make the rounds to various lakeside communities, frequently making connection with passenger trains at Iona/Grand Narrows where the railway crossed the Barra Strait. Unlike the industrial part of CBRM where coal, steel, and manufacturing industries flourished in the early 20th century, and the petroleum, manufacturing, and pulp and paper industries located in the Strait of Canso region since the construction of the Canso Causeway in 1955, Bras d'Or Lake has no major industries within its watershed aside from logging and gypsum extraction.  Mi'kmaq culture  The Mi'kmaq called the Bras d'Or \\"Pitupaq\\" Bi-doo-buck (long salt water). The lake connected ancient lakeside and even ocean coastal communities elsewhere on Cape Breton Island by Canoe such as Chapel Island, Eskasoni, Wagmatcook, Waycobah, and Galtoneg, among many others. The lake was also a major source of food for these historic communities, with abundant populations of mussels, crabs, clams, trout, salmon, herring, cod and mackerel.  Historic role as a research centre and first Bell Labs  From the summer of 1886, famed inventor and scientist Alexander Graham Bell made his estate and future retirement home at Red Head, a peninsula opposite Baddeck. He named his 640 Acre estate Beinn Bhreagh (pronounced \\"ben vreeah\\" meaning \\"Beautiful Mountain\\" in Scottish Gaelic) and lived there half of his life until his death in 1922. It is because of Bell's connection to this area that Beinn Bhreagh and Baddeck are routinely featured on National Geographic maps showing eastern North America.Bethune, Jocelyn. Historic Baddeck: Images of our past, Nimbus Publishing, Halifax, N.S., 2009, , . Bell established a research laboratory‚Äîthe first Bell Labs on Beinn Bhreagh, and used the Bras d'Or Lake to test man-carrying kites, airplanes and hydrofoil boats, as part of his many and varying research activities. Flight of the Silver Dart Baddeck Bay, between Baddeck and Beinn Bhreagh, was the site of the first officially recognized heavier-than-air powered flight in the British Empire which then included Canada. The flight was performed by an airplane designed by Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, F.C. Baldwin and Glenn Curtiss and others, in the original Bell Labs on Beinn Bhreagh. The Silver Dart flew off the frozen ice of Baddeck Bay in January 1909. Commemorating this event, 100 years later, in January, 2009 a replica of the original airplane was flown off the ice in the same location: Baddeck Bay. After demonstrating their airplanes using tricycle landing wheels and other innovations, Bell's laboratory on Beinn Bhreagh designed and built a hydrofoil boat- the HD4 ‚Äì which set a water speed record of 71 MPH (63 knots) in 1919. , an experimental 1960s-era Canadian Forces hydrofoil, reportedly the world's fastest warship ever built, was named in honour of the hydrofoils tested long before on Baddeck Bay by Bell. In 2003, National Geographic Traveler rated Cape Breton Island its second-ranked worldwide destination for sustainable tourism, citing Bras d'Or Lake as having a major influence on this designation. Cape Breton Island tied for second place with New Zealand's South Island and Chile's Torres del Paine, behind the Norwegian fjords. Via Rail Canada's weekly Halifax‚ÄìSydney tourist passenger train, the Bras d'Or was named in honour of the spectacular scenery provided by Bras d'Or Lake along the eastern part of its journey.

It is located in the Marina district of downtown San Diego near the Gaslamp Quarter, at 111 West Harbor Drive. The center is managed by the San Diego Convention Center Corporation, a non-profit public benefit corporation created by the City of San Diego. History San Diego approved a measure to fund construction of a new convention center in 1983 on land owned by the Port of San Diego. Construction of the original building began in March 1987 and was completed in November 1989. An expansion which doubled the gross square footage of the facility was completed in September 2001. In September 2008 the center took steps to acquire adjacent property for an additional expansion. Notable events hosted at the convention center include the annual Comic-Con International convention and the Society for Neuroscience. Television game show Wheel of Fortune did live tapings of shows at the Convention Center featuring contestants from the San Diego area that aired nationally in 1997, 2003, and 2007. It hosted the 1996 Republican National Convention, which nominated Bob Dole and Jack Kemp for President and Vice President of the United States, respectively. It was also the venue for the 2007 California Democratic Party Convention. In 2008, the Hilton San Diego Bayfront opened south of the convention center; this was followed by the Harbor Drive Pedestrian Bridge which opened in the Spring of 2011, which links the Convention Center with the neighborhoods on the other side of Harbor Drive. In 2014, the Convention Center hosted the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) International Convention, bringing in $56 million to the economy of San Diego. In 2016, the second annual convention for the video game streaming plaform Twitch, TwitchCon was hosted at the Convention center, in 2019, TwitchCon was hosted once more at the Convention Center, later revealing at the event that it would yet again be hosted at the convention center in September 2020. Notable events *1996 Republican National Convention *Biotechnology Industry Organization, held in 2014 *Esri International User Conference, held annually since 1997 *San Diego Comic-Con, held annually since 1979 *Society for Neuroscience, held in 2016 and 2018 *Wheel of Fortune, held in 1997, 2003, and 2007 *TwitchCon, held in 2016 and 2019, planned for 2020 Design The convention center offers of exhibit space. As of 2009 it was the 24th largest convention facility in North America. It was designed by Canadian architect Arthur Erickson. Capacity for the facility is 125,000. The center's most distinguishing feature is the Sails Pavilion, a exhibit and special event area. The Sails Pavilion's roof consists of distinctive Teflon-coated fiberglass \\"sails\\" intended to reflect San Diego's maritime history, as well as to advertise the center's proximity to the San Diego shore. The Pavilion was originally built as an open-air facility under the roof. However, the center found it hard to convince potential users to book an open-air facility, so in 2000 the Pavilion area was enclosed in glass, greatly expanding the usable area of the center. Beginning in December 2016, the Sails Pavilion began a renovation period. Renovations to the Sails Pavilion were completed in late February 2018, with a capability addition of a programmable LED lighting system. Another unusual feature of the convention center is its inclined elevator, which ascends alongside the large exterior staircase. Proposed expansion Beginning in 2008, the Convention Center began to pay the lease owners of the neighboring Fifth Avenue Landing property in a deal which would have bought out the lease. By November 2012, there was a $520 million proposal to expand the Convention Center. The proposed expansion would have increased the available space within the convention center by 33 percent and had a target completion date of early 2016. In March 2013, judicial approval was received for the funding method for the expansion; the funding would come from a special taxing district consisting of hotels in San Diego. The expansion was approved by the California Coastal Commission in October 2013. However, on August 1, 2014, a California appeals court ruled the hotel tax unconstitutional, jeopardizing the financing scheme for the convention center expansion, forcing the city to either appeal the decision, seek ballot approval for the tax in accordance with the court's ruling, or come up with an entirely new financing scheme. Attorney Cory Briggs was the filing attorney for the successful lawsuit; in 2015, Briggs had another lawsuit filed regarding the bay front nature of the proposed expansion. The decision was not appealed by the San Diego City Council. The effort to expand the convention center up to August 2014 expended $10 million. Due to the lawsuit, other cities have contacted Comic-Con International regarding the possibility of relocating away from San Diego. In May 2015, the Convention Center stopped paying the lease owners of the Fifth Avenue Landing, having spent $4 million up to that point, losing their rights to the property. In June 2015, the Coastal Commission again approved the convention center expansion plan. In January 2017, Briggs's lawsuit regarding the bayfront nature of the proposed expansion was thrown out. By 2017, plans to expand the convention center began again. However, the proposed expansion is opposed by a hotel proposal on the Fifth Avenue Landing property which was released when the previous expansion proposal ended. In 2018, a ballot initiative was launched seeking to raise funds and to gain approval for the convention center re-proposed expansion, as well as to fund services for homeless individuals; the ballot initiative will be voted on in 2020. In November 2018, the City of San Diego paid the lease owners of the Fifth Avenue Landing, to settle a lawsuit out of court regarding development rights. While the lawsuit was occurring, the Port of San Diego and the City of San Diego were in negotiations with the Fifth Avenue Landing to enter into a new lease to allow for Convention Center expansion on the neighboring property, which would involve an initial $5 million payment, and a total $32 million buyout if the ballot initiative passes. In January 2019, San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer stated that a deal for the Fifth Avenue Landing was still in negotiation, and the lease owners had the right to build a hotel on their leased land, which has been envisioned as where the Convention Center would expand.

The theology outlined in this work saw Ethiopians (in the classical sense of all Africans) as the chosen people of God. The church preached self-reliance and self-determination for Africans, using the Piby as its guiding document. The Holy Piby is made up of four books. The first, entitled \\"The First Book of Athlyi Called Athlyi\\", has only two chapters. The next, \\"The Second Book of Athlyi Called Aggregation\\", is the largest, with fifteen chapters, the seventh of which identifies Marcus GarveyMarcus Garvey, Internet Sacred Text Archive , Last Accessed May 24, 2007. as one of three apostles of God. The \\"Third Book of Athlyi Named The Facts of the Apostles\\" presents two prominent members of the UNIA-ACL, Robert Lincoln PostonApostles Anointed, Internet Sacred Text Archive , Last Accessed May 24, 2007. and Henrietta Vinton Davis,God spoke to his Apostles, Internet Sacred Text Archive , Last Accessed May 24, 2007. as the other apostles in the Holy Trinity. The title of the last book is \\"The Fourth Book of Athlyi Called Precaution\\". That book is followed by a series of catechism-style questions and answers wherein Garvey, Davis and Poston are proclaimed to be the saviors of the \\"down trodden children of Ethiopia\\". Together with the Royal Parchment Scroll of Black Supremacy by Fitz Balintine Pettersburg and Leonard P. Howell's The Promise Key, the Holy Piby is today recognized as a root document of Rastafari thought. While not strictly speaking a \\"Rastafari text\\", it was certainly a primary source of influence to many in the Rastafari movement, who see His Imperial Majesty, Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia, as Christ (or rather, his second coming). Some Rastafari see Emperor Haile Selassie I as Christ in His Kingly Character as written in the Book of Revelation, Chapter 5 and Marcus Mosia Garvey, as a prophet. The original edition of the Holy Piby was published in the United States, at Newark, New Jersey, in 1924. It is very rare. There are no copies listed in either the Library of Congress nor the University of California catalogs. The Holy Piby was banned in Jamaica and other Caribbean Islands in the middle and late 1920s.

(stylized on-screen as John Carpenter's Escape from L.A.) is a 1996 American post-apocalyptic action film co-written, co-scored, and directed by John Carpenter, co-written and produced by Debra Hill and Kurt Russell, with Russell also starring as Snake Plissken. A sequel to Escape from New York, Escape from L.A. co-stars Steve Buscemi, Stacy Keach, Bruce Campbell, and Pam Grier. The film received a mixed reception and was a box- office bomb.https://thedissolve.com/features/movie-of-the-week/931-john- carpenters-other-sillier-escape/ Plot In 1998, Los Angeles has become immensely crime-ridden and decadent, ultimately being directly governed and patrolled by the recently created United States Police Force. Two years later, on August 23, 2000, a massive earthquake strikes the city, the San Fernando Valley floods, and the Los Angeles area turns into an island from Malibu to Anaheim. A theocratic presidential candidate declares Los Angeles to be sinful and punished by God. When he is elected president for life, the capital is relocated to his hometown in Lynchburg, Virginia, he also declares that anyone not conforming to the new \\"Moral America\\" laws that he creates, which ban such things as tobacco, alcoholic beverages, recreational drugs, red meat, firearms, profanity, atheism, non Christian religions, and extramarital sex will be stripped of their citizenship and deported to Los Angeles Island unless they repent and choose death by electrocution. A containment wall is built around the island, armed guards and watchtowers are posted, and those sent to the island are exiled permanently. In 2013, Cuervo Jones, a Shining Path Peruvian Revolutionary, seduces the president's daughter, Utopia, via a holographic system and brainwashes her into stealing her father's remote control to the \\"Sword of Damocles\\" super weapon, a series of satellites capable of rendering all electronic devices anywhere on the planet useless. The president intends to use the system to destroy US enemies' ability to function and eventually dominate the world. While traveling aboard Air Force Three, Utopia leaves the plane in an escape pod and lands on Los Angeles Island to join with Cuervo. With the satellites under his control, Cuervo promises to take back the United States with the assistance of an allied invasion force of third world nations that are standing by to attack. Cuervo claims that if the president tries to stop him, he will \\"pull the plug\\" on the country and black out the capital. Cuervo also knows the secret world code that can knock out power for the entire planet. Snake Plissken is captured for another series of crimes and is scheduled to be exiled to the island. Upon his arrival for deportation, Snake meets the president and is offered the mission of retrieving the weapon. The president says he will give him a full pardon if he is successful. The president indicates he does not care if Utopia is returned or not, declaring her a traitor. To ensure his compliance, Snake is infected with the man-made Plutoxin 7 virus that will kill him within 10 hours; if he completes the mission, he will receive the cure. Snake is given an assault rifle, a personal holographic projector, a thermal-camouflage overcoat, and a countdown clock for how long he has to live. He sneaks into the city using a one-man submarine that he loses when the platform it landed on crumbles, causing the sub to sink. Making his way across the island, Snake meets \\"Map to the Stars\\" Eddie, a swindler who sells interactive tours of Los Angeles. At various times, Snake receives assistance from Pipeline, a surfing enthusiast; Taslima, a woman deported to the island for her Muslim faith; and Hershe Las Palmas (formerly Carjack Malone), a transgender woman and past criminal associate of Snake. Snake defeats Cuervo at his staging area of the Happy Kingdom by the Sea in Anaheim and takes the remote control. Snake and Eddie leave the island with Utopia and some other Cuervo resistors in a helicopter. Cuervo is shot from the helicopter by Eddie, but manages to fire a rocket launcher at the chopper before dying. Eddie jumps out of the helicopter and lands on an awning. The rocket hits the chopper and kills everyone inside, including Hershe, except for Snake and Utopia, who jump out before it crashes into a mountain. When the president's men reach the crash site, Commander Malloy believes that Snake is trying to trick the president by giving him the wrong remote and proceeds to find another one on Utopia. After checking the disc inside, Commander Malloy announces that they will take the one that Utopia unknowingly had in her possession. The president then has his men take Utopia to the electric chair despite her pleas for forgiveness. Snake remains alive even after his countdown clock reaches zero, and learns that Plutoxin 7 is only a potent influenza virus whose effects wear off within hours of infection. The president tries to use the satellites to stop a Cuban invasion force threatening Florida. Activating the remote, the president hears only Eddie's \\"Map to the Stars\\" intro over \\"I Love L.A.\\" The president orders Snake's execution, but Snake previously activated his hologram projector, and the Snake who gets shot is an illusion. Snake activates the real control device, entering the world code and ending all technological activity on the planet, against pleas to stop. At the deportation center, Utopia expresses her delight that Snake shut down the Earth and thus saved her. Snake lights a cigarette and blows out the match used to light it, uttering, \\"Welcome to the human race.\\" Cast Production Development and writing The film was in development for over 10 years.

Reception Box office Escape from L.A. grossed $25,477,365 from its $50 million budget, about as much as its predecessor but little more than half its significantly higher budget. Critical reception The film received mixed reviews and has a 54% approval rating from Rotten Tomatoes based on 50 reviews, with an average score of 5.58/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"Escape from L.A. has its moments, although it certainly suffers in comparison to the cult classic that preceded it\\". Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of a possible four and wrote that the movie felt it was an attempt to satirize the genre while exploiting it: \\"[Escape from L.A.] has such manic energy, such a weird, cockeyed vision, that it may work on some moviegoers as satire and on others as the real thing.\\" Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote, \\"A cartoonish, cheesy, and surprisingly campy apocalyptic actioner, John Carpenter's Escape From L.A. is spiked with a number of funny and anarchic ideas, but doesn't begin to pull them together into a coherent whole.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly rated it C+ and wrote, \\"Carpenter never was the filmmaker his cult claimed him to be, but in Escape From L.A., he at least has the instinct to keep his hero moving, like some leather-biker Candide.\\" Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote that the film's in-jokes \\"go a long way toward keeping afloat a hopelessly choppy adventure spoof that doesn't even to try to match the ghoulish surrealism of its forerunner.\\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"With much humor and high adventure, John Carpenter's Escape From L.A. brilliantly imagines a Dante-esque vision of the City of Angels.\\" Peter Stack of The San Francisco Chronicle rated it 3/4 stars and called it \\"dark, percussive and perversely fun.\\" Esther Iverem of The Washington Post wrote that the film \\"tries but fails to be an action-hero flick or even a parody of one.\\" Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle rated it 3/5 stars and wrote, \\"Loud, rollicking, alternately ultraviolent and hilarious, Escape from L.A. is Snake redux, and what more do you need, really?\\" Nigel Floyd of Time Out London wrote, \\"After 15 years of computer- generated effects, apocalyptic sci-fi and Arnie movies with flippant kiss-off lines, the sequel feels hackneyed and pointless.\\" Kim Newman of Empire rated it 2/5 stars and wrote, \\"Apart from a few good characters, this is really not up to scratch in most departments especially the ludicrous plot.\\" In a 2013 retrospective, Alan Zilberman of The Atlantic called Snake Plissken \\"a pro- nostalgia antihero, disgusted by the world around him.\\" While contrasting the film's then-futuristic plot elements against modern-day reality, Zilberman writes that the film's ending is more profound today, as Plissken would be annoyed by our fascination with technology, citing the example of two friends who ignore each other while transfixed with their smart phones. John Carpenter later reflected: > Escape from L.A. is better than the first movie. Ten times better. It's got > more to it. It's more mature. It's got a lot more to it.

He succeeded William McKinley as governor, serving two two-year terms from 1896 to 1900. Valentine Anti-Trust Act During the Bushnell administration, Ohio took an early leadership role in trust-busting. The Valentine Anti-Trust Act was signed into law by Bushnell. This Act prohibited price fixing, and production limitation. All of these practices helped businesses by driving up the prices for their products, thus harming the consumer. In addition to Valentine Anti- Trust Act, Bushnell's attorney general pursued the monopolistic practices of the Standard Oil Company in the courts. Eventually, U.S. Senator John Sherman of Ohio introduced the Sherman Antitrust Act in the United States Congress in 1890. This law served as the first serious attempt by the federal government to break up monopolies and trusts, though successful enforcement of anti-trust laws was still more than a decade, and new political commitment, away.\\"Valentine Anti-Trust Act\\" Ohio History Central.

She is best known as the discoverer and first director of Gournia, one of the first archaeological excavations to uncover a Minoan settlement and palace on the Aegean island of Crete. Early life and education Harriet Ann Boyd was born in Boston, Massachusetts. Her mother died when she was a child, and so Harriet was raised by her father alongside her four older brothers. She was first introduced to the study of Classics by her brother, Alex. After attending the Prospect Hill School in Greenfield, she went on to graduate from Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts in 1892 with a degree in Classics (specializing in Greek). Academic career After working as a teacher for four years, she followed her passion for Greece and its ancient culture, pursuing further studies in Classics at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens, Greece. She had originally intended on pursuing studies in England but she decided to go Greece based both on the brother of the archaeologist, Louis Dyer, and having heard Amelia Edwards speak while a student at Smith. During her stay in Greece she also served as a volunteer nurse in Thessaly during the Greco-Turkish War. She asked her professors to be allowed to participate in the school's archaeological fieldwork, but instead was encouraged to become an academic librarian. Hawes was awarded the Agnes Hoppin Memorial Fellowship in 1899. Frustrated by lack of support, she took the remainder of her fellowship and went on her own in search of archaeological remains on the island of Crete. This was a courageous decision, as Crete was only just emerging from the war and was far from safe. Her ability to speak fluent Greek, and her record of service with the Red Cross during the Greco-Turkish War a few years earlier, earned her a degree of goodwill from local people that proved critical to the success of her work. In Crete, she visited the excavation of Knossos led by British archaeologist Arthur Evans, who suggested she explore the region of Kavousi. Hawes soon became well known for her expertise in the field of archaeology, and for four months in the spring of 1900 she led an excavation at Kavousi, during which she discovered settlements and cemeteries of Late Minoan IIIC, Early Iron Age, and Early Archaic date (1200-600 BC) at the sites of Vronda and Kastro. During that same campaign she dug a test trench at the site of Azoria, the most important Ancient Greek (i.e. post- Minoan) site in the region, evidently an early city (c. 700-500 BC). Azoria is now under renewed excavation as part of a major five-year project.\\"The Azoria Project is the excavation of an Early Iron Age and Archaic site (ca. 1200-500 B.C.) on the island of Crete in the Greek Aegean. Fieldwork is conducted by permission of the Greek Ministry of Culture under the auspices of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens and the Archaeological Service of Eastern Crete, Ephorate of Antiquities of Lasithi (former 24th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities). The main supporting institutions are the Department of Classics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the Classical Studies Program at Iowa State University, the Curriculum in Archaeology and the Research Laboratories of Archaeology at UNC, the Institute for Aegean Prehistory Study Center for East Crete (INSTAP-SCEC), and the Duke- UNC Consortium for Classical and Mediterranean Archaeology (CCMA).\\" University of North Carolina page on the project Later the same year, Hawes returned to the United States. She accepted a position at Smith College teaching Greek Archaeology, epigraphy, and modern Greek in late 1900, and subsequently received her M.A. from Smith in 1901. She taught at Smith until 1905, interspersing her time there with frequent trips abroad for archaeological excursions. Between 1901 and 1904, while on leave of absence from Smith, Harriet Boyd Hawes returned to Crete, where she discovered and excavated the Minoan town at Gournia. Hawes was the first woman to direct a major field project in Greece, her crew consisting of over 100 workers. She was also the first archaeologist to discover and completely excavate an Early Bronze Age Minoan town site. The material excavated from the site of Gournia was divided between the Heraklion Archaeological Museum in Crete and the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, which supported her excavations. She was assisted by Edith Hall Dohan, her classmate from Smith College. In 1902, she described her discovery during a lecture tour of the United States and was the first woman to speak before the Archaeological Institute of America. The report of her findings, titled Vasiliki and Other Prehistoric Sites on the Isthmus of Hierapetra, was published in 1908 by the American Exploration Society. She excavated many more Bronze and Iron Age settlements in the Aegean and became a recognized authority on the area. In 1910, Smith College bestowed on her an honorary doctorate. Between 1920 and her retirement in 1936, she lectured at Wellesley College on pre-Christian art. War nursing Boyd Hawes became involved in wartime nursing efforts after her graduation from Smith College. She cared for injured and dying soldiers in the Greco-Turkish War (1897), Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War (1898), and World War I. Her work during World War I included bringing supplies to Corfu for wounded soldiers in the Serbian Army (1915), helping the wounded in France (1916), and founding the Smith College Relief Unit in France (1917). Boyd Hawes was director of the latter for three years, during which time she also worked as a nurse's aide at the YMCA. After her return home, Boyd Hawes continued her support for the war effort by giving fund-raising lectures on behalf of the Smith College Relief Unit. Personal life During one trip to Crete, she met Charles Henry Hawes, an English anthropologist and archaeologist who later became the associate-director of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. They were married on March 3, 1906, and nine months later their son, Alexander Boyd Hawes, was born. When their daughter Mary Nesbit Hawes followed in August 1910, Charles was teaching at Dartmouth College and the family was living in Hanover, New Hampshire. In 1920, the family moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts and Harriet joined the faculty at Wellesley College. Hawes always remained committed to her academic and archaeological work as well as to her family. Later life and legacy When Charles retired in 1936, the couple moved to Washington D.C., where Harriet remained after her husband died. She died there on March 31, 1945, aged 73. Harriet is either interred in Cedar Hill Cemetery in Suitland, Maryland or in Forest Hills Cemetery in Jamaica Plain, Boston, Massachusetts.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/156415043/harriet-ann-hawes Her childhood home in Chester Square is featured on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail.

Punchbowl Crater is an extinct volcanic tuff cone located in Honolulu, Hawaii. It is the location of the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific. The crater was formed some 75,000 to 100,000 years ago during the secondary activity of the Honolulu Volcanic Series. A crater resulted from the ejection of hot lava through cracks in the old coral reefs which, at the time, extended to the foot of the Koolau Mountain Range. The volcano is most likely a monogenetic volcano, meaning that it only erupted once. Although there are various translations of the Punchbowl's Hawaiian name, \\"Puowaina,\\" the most common is \\"Hill of Sacrifice.\\" This translation closely relates to the history of the crater. The first known use was as an altar where Hawaiians offered human sacrifices to their gods and killed violators of the many taboos. Later, during the reign of Kamehameha the Great, a battery of two cannons was mounted at the rim of the crater to salute distinguished arrivals and signify important occasions. Early in the 1880s, leasehold land on the slopes of the Punchbowl opened for settlement and in the 1930s, the crater was used as a rifle range for the Hawaii National Guard. Toward the end of World War II, tunnels were dug through the rim of the crater for the placement of shore batteries to guard Honolulu Harbor and the south edge of Pearl Harbor. During the late 1890s, a committee recommended that the Punchbowl become the site for a new cemetery to accommodate the growing population of Honolulu. The idea was rejected for fear of polluting the water supply and the emotional aversion to creating a city of the dead above a city of the living. Fifty years later, Congress authorized a small appropriation to establish a national cemetery in Honolulu with two provisions: that the location be acceptable to the War Department, and that the site would be donated rather than purchased. In 1943, the governor of Hawaii offered the Punchbowl for a national cemetery. The $50,000 appropriation proved insufficient, however, and the project was deferred until after World War II. By 1947, Congress and veteran organizations placed a great deal of pressure on the military to find a permanent burial site in Hawaii for the remains of thousands of World War II servicemen on the island of Guam awaiting permanent burial. Subsequently, the Army again began planning the Punchbowl cemetery; in February 1948 Congress approved funding and construction began.

Hammond was born in Troy, New York and served as a Marine Corps fighter pilot in World War II with the Black Sheep Squadron. In 1946, he moved to Alaska where he worked as a bush pilot. Hammond served as a state representative from 1959 to 1965 and as a state senator from 1967 to 1973. From 1972 until 1974 he was the mayor of the Bristol Bay Borough. Then, in 1974, he was elected governor of Alaska. He oversaw the creation of the Alaska Permanent Fund in 1976, which, since the early 1980s, has paid annual dividends to Alaska residents. He advocated for fiscal responsibility. When his tenure as governor was over, he continued to be active in public life. He advocated for environmentally and fiscally responsible government and individual civic responsibility. From 1985 to 1992 he hosted a television series called Jay Hammond's Alaska. He wrote three autobiographies. Early life Jay Sterner Hammond was born in Troy, New York in 1922. Hammond studied petroleum engineering at Penn State University, where he was a member of Triangle Fraternity. He later served as a Marine Corps fighter pilot in World War II with the Black Sheep Squadron, and in China, until 1946. That year, Hammond moved to Alaska where he worked as a bush pilot and earned a degree in biological sciences at the University of Alaska. Hammond had one daughter, Wendy, with his first wife, but that marriage ended in divorce. In 1952, Hammond married his second wife, Bella Gardiner, with whom he had two daughters, Heidi and Dana. Political career Alaska Legislature Hammond served as a state representative from 1959 to 1965 and as a state senator from 1967 to 1973. Hammond served in the 1st Alaska State Legislature as an independent, joining thirty-four Democrats and five Republicans in the forty-member House. At the time, Hammond believed that a Republican could not be elected in that particular time and place, but that he could not envision running as a Democrat on account of his upbringing and background. He did serve as a Republican in subsequent legislatures, however. He was Senate President in his final two years in the legislature. Bristol Bay Borough Hammond was the mayor of the Bristol Bay Borough from 1972 to 1974. He also served as the borough's manager during his time away from the legislature in the 1960s. Governor of Alaska Hammond was elected governor in 1974 in a close result over incumbent William A. Egan. The race was complicated by two major factors, amongst others. One was a reversal of roles of sorts, where Hammond and his running mate Lowell Thomas Jr. were identified as conservationists, confusing and splitting the traditional party base. The other was the appearance, for the first time, of a substantial third-party candidate, Fairbanks miner and real estate developer Joe Vogler. Vogler's open contempt for the environmental movement created a further voter rift which no doubt helped Hammond. As governor during the biggest economic boom in Alaska's history, the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, Hammond oversaw the creation of the Alaska Permanent Fund. The concept of the Permanent Fund, originally championed in 1969 by then-governor Keith Miller and Anchorage Times publisher and editor Robert Atwood on the eve of the Prudhoe Bay oil lease sale, lay dormant for years as a result of the legislature spending the proceeds of the lease sale and construction delays associated with the pipeline. During his first term as governor, Hammond, along with a young state representative from Kenai named Hugh Malone, conceived a program to invest oil royalties to cover future state budget shortfalls as well as create a long- term savings account. Alaska voters approved a constitutional amendment establishing the Permanent Fund in 1976, one of the rare exceptions to the constitutional intent of not dedicating funds for a specific purpose. Since the early 1980s, the Permanent Fund has paid annual dividends to Alaska residents, under a program in which credit has been variously given to, or taken by, Hammond, Malone, Libertarian state representative Dick Randolph and numerous other Alaskan politicians of the day. At around the same time, Alaska eliminated its state income tax. Hammond is often erroneously credited for this; in fact, he was actually staunchly opposed to the idea. The elimination of the income tax was actually championed by Randolph, who persuaded his fellow legislators to pass the bill after mounting an initiative to force a public vote should the legislature not act. A 1980 episode of the public television program Alaska Review (currently held in the collections of the Alaska Film Archives) prominently featured an edited \\"debate\\" between Hammond and Randolph on the subject, centered on the fact that Alaska faced a one- billion-dollar budget surplus that year. As governor, Hammond advocated for fiscal responsibility, and introduced an amendment to the Alaska Constitution limiting state spending. This was mocked by one legislator as \\"Spendy Limitation,\\" with an accompanying elegant and obfuscatory statement mimicking Hammond's unique way with the English language. He advocated for another constitutional amendment providing for governors to serve a single 6-year term without possibility of further service. He felt it would allow governors a free hand in accomplishing their goals. He also championed a program which opened large amounts of state-owned lands near Delta Junction for agricultural use. While greater aspects of the program have been variously condemned as a \\"boondoggle\\" over the years, Delta Junction has managed to emerge as one of the larger agricultural producing communities in Alaska. He also vigorously fought with the legislature over power struggles between the two branches of government, culminating with four proposed constitutional amendments on the 1980 ballot, all of which failed by large margins. Later life Hammond during the last year of his life. After his tenure as governor, Hammond continued to be active in public life. He advocated for environmentally and fiscally responsible government, and individual civic responsibility. Hammond wrote articles for newspapers in Alaska, and appeared in public service announcements on television. He hosted a television series called Jay Hammond's Alaska from 1985 to 1992. Hammond survived a rafting accident on August 6, 1988 while shooting an episode of the series on the Tana River in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park. Killed in the accident were Larry Holmstrom, the show's executive producer, Holmstrom's daughter Maria, and cameraman Ronald Eagle. Three others on the raft besides Hammond also survived, including one who also fell into the water of the Class IV river. Hammond wrote three autobiographies, Tales of Alaska's Bush Rat Governor: The Extraordinary Autobiography of Jay Hammond, Wilderness Guide and Reluctant Politician, Chips from the Chopping Block: More Tales from Alaska's Bush Rat Governor and Diapering The Devil: How Alaska Helped Staunch Befouling by Mismanaged Oil Wealth; a Lesson for Other Rich Nations. The latter book, published in 2011, was co-edited by Hammond's granddaughter Lauren Stanford. Hammond also wrote the preface to Brother Asaiah, As Remembered by Martha Ellen Anderson and Friends, a memoir of the life of Homer businessman and peace activist Brother Asaiah Bates, which was published in 2006 following the deaths of both Bates and Hammond. Hammond's last major public appearances were in early 2004, centered around the Conference of Alaskans convened by governor Frank Murkowski. Murkowski, recalling the spirit of the constitutional convention, assembled fifty-five delegates from across Alaska to meet at the University of Alaska Fairbanks to tackle specific questions regarding Alaska's fiscal future. Apart from launching the political career of Mark Neuman, who proclaimed himself to be one of the few ordinary people amongst the delegates and who was elected to the state house later that year, little was accomplished by the conference in the end. Hammond spent much of the conference holding court outside of the Wood Center ballroom where sessions were held, espousing his own solutions, which included doubling the amount of the Permanent Fund dividend and restoring the state income tax, the latter of which was strongly opposed by Murkowski. The delegates responded to Hammond by endorsing an income tax proposal, which delegate Clark Gruening described as a \\"declaration of independence\\" from Murkowski. Several weeks after the conference, Hammond spoke before Commonwealth North, proclaiming that he would spend $50,000 of his own money if necessary to campaign for his dividend and income tax plan. Death Hammond lived at his homestead on Lake Clark, until his death at age 83 on August 2, 2005. According to his wife, Bella, he died peacefully in his sleep.

The Tories used Wilfong's clothes line to chase away his horses. The marauders were captured by Cleveland's men, who had them hanged using the clothes line they had stolen. In revenge, a group of Tories led by Captain William Riddle kidnapped Cleveland. Cleveland's men rescued him and captured Riddle and two others. All three were hanged from the same tree, which became known as the \\"Tory Oak,\\" and was for years an historic landmark behind the old Wilkes County courthouse (now the Wilkes Historical Museum). Kings Mountain Historical marker about Cleveland on the Cleveland/Bradley County Greenway in Cleveland, Tennessee. In 1780, General Lord Cornwallis led a British army into the Carolinas, and won several victories over the patriots. Major Patrick Ferguson, one of Cornwallis's commanders, led an army of Tories into the North Carolina mountains to crush the rebels there. A large force of mountain men attacked Ferguson at Kings Pinnacle, an isolated ridge on the North Carolina-South Carolina border. Cleveland played a key role in the ensuing Battle of Kings Mountain. According to legend, Cleveland climbed up Rendezvous Mountain and blew his horn to summon some 200 Wilkes County militiamen. He led them into battle. Cleveland's horse was shot from under him, and Major Ferguson was himself killed in the battle. Cleveland's brother, Robert, is said to have rallied the militiamen during the heat of the battle, contributing to the patriot victory. Cleveland claimed Ferguson's white stallion as a \\"war prize\\", and rode it home to his estate of Roundabout. Later years After the war, Cleveland moved to the South Carolina frontier and was a commissioner in the Pendleton District. He died at his home in Oconee County, South Carolina in 1806 of heart dropsy. An obelisk monument to him stands on private property just north of U.S. Route 123 about 160 yds (145 m) east of the Madison Baptist Church in the Madison Community of Oconee County. He was buried about 1 mi (1.6 km) away in a private cemetery. Legacy Cleveland County, North Carolina and Cleveland, Tennessee are named in his honor. A historical marker dedicated to Cleveland reads: \\"Colonel in Revolution, Whig leader in battle of Kings Mountain, state legislator.

It was developed specifically for, and served almost exclusively on, the s (heavy aviation cruiser in Russian classification). Design and development A diagram showing the lift forces on a Yak-38 in VTOL mode Designed by the A.S. Yakovlev Design Bureau JSC, the first drawings showed a supersonic aircraft strongly resembling the Hawker P.1154 in study in the United Kingdom, but with two R27-300 engines. Supersonic performances would have implied many difficulties of development, and it was decided to initially develop a relatively simple aircraft limited to Mach 0.95. Although the Yak-38 and Yak-38M were developed from the land-based Yakovlev Yak-36, the aircraft had almost nothing in common. The prototype VM-01 was finished on 14 April 1970. Though outwardly similar to the British Hawker Siddeley Harrier, it followed a completely different configuration. Together with a vectorable thrust engine in the rear used during flight, two smaller, and less powerful, engines were housed in the front portion of the fuselage and used purely for takeoff and landing.The Harrier has only one engine, the thrust being vectored through nozzles fore and aft. The Yak-38 possessed an automatic ejection seat. If one of the takeoff engines failed or the aircraft rolled past 60 degrees the pilot was automatically ejected from the aircraft. Operational history MAKS airshow in 1993 Folded wing of a Yak-38 The majority of Yak-36M initial production deliveries were to the 279 OKShAP (Otdelny Korabelny Shturmovoy Aviatsionny Polk, Independent Shipboard Attack Air Regiment), initially based at Saki, the AV-MF's training centre in Crimea. In July 1979, Minsk arrived in the Sea of Japan, where the vessel was home-ported at Strelok Bay, the Yak-38 component of its air wing thereafter being provided by the 311 OKShAP subordinate to the Pacific Fleet. In September 1982, ‚Äì the third Kiev-class carrier ‚Äì was commissioned. By now the V/STOL technique had been well practised, and the resulting increase in the Yak-38's overall performance and capability was exploited during the passage of Novorossiysk from Severomorsk to join the Pacific Fleet. A pair of armed Yak-38s operating from Minsk intercepted aircraft from the U.S. carrier over the Arabian Sea on 16 December 1982. This event marked the first time Soviet VTOL aircraft intercepted American aircraft while armed with missiles.Weinraub, Bernard. \\"F-14's From Carrier Nimitz Chased 2 Libyan Jets, U.S. Officials Say.\\" New York Times, 19 February 1983.

In September 1983, AV-MF pilots operated from the civilian Ro-Ro vessel , and NII-VVS pilots conducted further tests from another Ro-Ro vessel, Nikolai Cherkasov. In both cases, use was made of a heat-resistant landing platform; further land-based trials tested the practicality of dispersed landing platforms, in a similar concept to the British Royal Air Force's Harrier operations in West Germany.Newdick, Thomas. \\"The Soviet Navy 'Forger': Yak-36M, Yak-38, Yak-38U and Yak-38M.\\" Air Combat Information Group, 27 November 2004.

It is a common cause of otherwise unexplained gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia. Lesions are often multiple, and frequently involve the cecum or ascending colon, although they can occur at other places. Treatment may be with colonoscopic interventions, angiography and embolization, medication, or occasionally surgery. Signs and symptoms Although some cases present with black, tarry stool (melena), the blood loss can be subtle, with the anemia symptoms predominating. Pathophysiology Histologically, it resembles telangiectasia and development is related to age and strain on the bowel wall. It is a degenerative lesion, acquired, probably resulting from chronic and intermittent contraction of the colon that is obstructing the venous drainage of the mucosa. As time goes by the veins become more and more tortuous, while the capillaries of the mucosa gradually dilate and precapillary sphincter becomes incompetent. Thus is formed an arteriovenous malformation characterized by a small tuft of dilated vessels. Although angiodysplasia is probably quite common, the risk of bleeding is increased in disorders of coagulation. A classic association is Heyde's syndrome (coincidence of aortic valve stenosis and bleeding from angiodysplasia). Obscure gastrointestinal bleeding and calcific aortic stenosis (Heyde's syndrome) In this disorder, von Willebrand factor (vWF) is proteolysed due to high shear stress in the highly turbulent blood flow around the aortic valve. vWF is most active in vascular beds with high shear stress, including angiodysplasias, and deficiency of vWF increases the bleeding risk from such lesions. Warkentin et al. argue that apart from aortic valve stenosis, some other conditions that feature high shear stress might also increase the risk of bleeding from angiodysplasia. Diagnosis Fecal occult blood testing is positive when bleeding is active. If bleeding is intermittent the test may be negative at times. Diagnosis of angiodysplasia is often accomplished with endoscopy, either colonoscopy or esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Although the lesions can be notoriously hard to find, the patient usually is diagnosed by endoscopy. A new technique, pill enteroscopy, has been a major advance in diagnosis, especially in the small bowel which is difficult to reach with traditional endoscopy. With this technique a pill that contains a video camera and radio transmitter is swallowed, and pictures of the small intestine are sent to a receiver worn by the patient. Recently, multiphase CT angiography (without positive oral contrast) has been shown to play a promising role in the diagnoses of small and large bowel angiodysplasia, especially when associated with active hemorrhage. Angiodysplasiae in the small bowel can also be diagnosed and treated with double-balloon enteroscopy, a technique involving a long endoscopic camera and overtube, both fitted with balloons, that allow the bowel to be accordioned over the camera. In cases with negative endoscopic findings and high clinical suspicion, selective angiography of the mesenteric arteries is sometimes necessary, but this allows for interventions at time of the procedure. An alternative is scintigraphy with red blood cells labeled with a radioactive marker; this shows the site of the bleeding on a gamma camera but tends to be unhelpful unless the bleeding is continuous and significant. Treatment If the anemia is severe, blood transfusion is required before any other intervention is considered. Endoscopic treatment is an initial possibility, where cautery or argon plasma coagulation (APC) treatment is applied through the endoscope. Failing this, angiography and embolization with particles is another microinvasive treatment option, which avoids the need for surgery and bowel resection. Here, the vessel supplying the angiodysplasia is selectively catheterized and embolized with microparticles. Resection of the affected part of the bowel may be needed if the other modalities fail. However, the lesions may be widespread, making such treatment impractical. If the bleeding is from multiple or inaccessible sites, systemic therapy with medication may be necessary. First-line options include the antifibrinolytics tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid. Estrogens can be used to stop bleeding from angiodysplasia. Estrogens cause mild hypercoaguability of the blood. Estrogen side effects can be dangerous and unpleasant in both sexes. Changes in voice and breast swelling is bothersome in men, but older women often report improvement of libido and perimenopausal symptoms. (The worries about hormone replacement therapy/HRT, however, apply here as well.) In difficult cases, there have been positive reports about octreotide and thalidomide. In severe cases or cases not responsive to either endoscopic or medical treatment, surgery may be necessary to arrest the bleeding.

Platform shoes may also be high heels, in which case the heel is raised significantly higher than the ball of the foot. Extreme heights, of both the sole and heel, can be found in fetish footwear such as ballet boots, where the sole may be up to high and the heels up to or more. The sole of a platform shoe can have a continuous uniform thickness, have a wedge, a separate block or a stiletto heel. Raising the ankle increases the risk of a sprained ankle. History Platform shoes are known in many cultures. The most famous predecessor of platform shoes are the Zoccoli in Venice of the 15th century, designed with the functional goal of avoiding wet feet when the pavements were flooded. Depending on the current shoe fashion platform shoes are more or less popular. In the 1970s they were widespread in both genders in Europe. Today, they are preferred by women. Ancient A maid wearing circle-type pattens: Piety in Pattens or Timbertoe on Tiptoe, England 1773 After their use in Ancient Greece for raising the height of important characters in the Greek theatre and their similar use by high-born prostitutes or courtesans in London in the sixteenth century, platform shoes, called Pattens, are thought to have been worn in Europe in the eighteenth century to avoid the muck of urban streets. Of the same practical origins are Japanese geta. There may also be a connection to the buskins of Ancient Rome, which frequently had very thick soles to give added height to the wearer. Another example of a platform shoe that functioned as protection from dirt and grime is the Okobo- \\"Okobo\\" referring to the sound that the wooden shoe makes when walking. Dating back to 18th century Japan, the Okobo was worn by maikos, or geishas, during their apprenticeships. Similar to the Okobo, wooden Kabkabs were named after the sound they made upon marble flooring. Worn by Lebanese women between the 14th and 17th centuries, the straps were often made from velvet, leather, or silk while the wooden stilts were decorated with silver or pearl. The ancient Indian Paduka, which translates to footprints of the Gods, was often sported by the upper echelon as a way to mark their status. The wooden platforms were sometimes carved into different animal shapes and decorated with ivory and silver.‚ÄúThe History of Platform Heels.‚Äù Fabulous Platform Shoes, fabulousplatformshoes.com/the- history-of-platform-heels. In ancient China, men wore black boots with very thick soles made from layers of white cloths. This style of boots is often worn today onstage for Peking opera. During the Qing dynasty, aristocratic Manchu women wore a form of platform shoe with a separate high heel, a style that was later adopted in Europe during the 1590s. Modern Platform shoes enjoyed some popularity in the United States, Europe and the UK from the 1930s to the 1950s but not nearly to the extent of their popularity from the 1960s to the 1980s. =20th century=  1930s‚Äì1950s  In the early 1930s, Moshe (Morris) Kimel designed the first modern version of the platform shoe for actress Marlene Dietrich. Kimel, a Jew, escaped Berlin, Germany, and settled in the United States with his family in 1939 and opened the Kimel shoe factory in Los Angeles. The design soon became very popular amongst Beverly Hills elite. In 1938, The Rainbow was a platform sandal designed by famous shoe designer, Salvatore Ferragamo. ‚ÄúThe Rainbow‚Äù was created and was the first instance of the platform shoe returning in modern days in the West. The platform sandal was designed for Judy Garland, an American singer, actress, and vaudevillian. This shoe was a tribute to Judy Garland's signature song ‚ÄúOver the Rainbow‚Äù performed in the Wizard of Oz in 1939.

In the 1940s, platforms were designed with a high arch, but as exemplified here, they originated with the heel elevated only slightly above the toes. The platform brings a heavy looking foundation to the wearer that is in direct polarity to the stiletto heel. With its reconfiguration of the arch and structure of attenuated insubstantiality, the high heel suggests the anti-gravitational effect of the dancer en pointe. On the contrary, the platform displays weightiness more like the flat steps of modern dance.Attitude and Altitude: A Short History of Shoes  Britannica Blog. (n.d.). Retrieved April 26, 2016, from http://blogs.britannica.com/2011/07/attitude-altitude-short-history-shoes/ In the 1950s, platform shoes were not favored in the same way that they used to be. Fashion returned to the more elegantly shaped shoe.http://www.queensofvintage.com/a-brief-history-platform-shoe/  1960s and 1970s  A resurgence of interest in platform shoes as fashion began as early as 1967 (appearing in both advertisements and articles in 1970 issues of Seventeen magazine), and continued through to 1976 in Europe and Britain, when they quite suddenly went out of fashion. The fad lasted even further in the US, lasting until as late as the early 1980s. At the beginning of the fad, they were worn primarily by young women in their teens and twenties, and occasionally by younger girls, older women, and (particularly during the disco era) by young men.http://www.wardrobecostume.co.uk/cat.asp?pageid=8&subid;=155&contentid;=836. Platform shoes were considered the \\"party shoe.\\" Disco-goers used their shoes to bring attention to themselves on the dance floor. 70s platform shoes were presented in dramatic and showy ways such as with glitter or tiny lights. In 1972, at 219 Bowery in Manhattan, Carole Basetta developed a special mold for making platform shoes and was successful in selling custom-made shoes to people such as David Bowie, David Johanson of the New York Dolls, and several other punk artists.Picture of a classic 1970s men's platform shoe for going out dancing at a disco from an Internet wardrobe costume rental site: Although platform shoes did provide added height without the discomfort of spike heels, they seem to have been worn primarily for the sake of attracting attention. Many glam rock musicians wore platform shoes as part of their act. David Bowie, an icon of glam rock in the 1970s, famously wore platform shoes while performing as his alter ego Ziggy Stardust. Bowie is regarded as an icon of androgynous fashion, noted for his queering of gender and performance style. While a wide variety of styles were popular during this period, including boots, espadrilles, oxfords, sneakers, and sandals of all description, with soles made of wood, cork, or synthetic materials, the most popular style of the late 1960s and early 1970s was a simple quarter-strap sandal with tan water buffalo-hide straps, on a beige suede-wrapped cork wedge-heel platform sole. These were originally introduced under the brand name Kork-Ease but the extreme popularity supported many imitators. Remarkably, there was very little variation in style, and most of that variation was limited to differences in height.  1980s  As the fad progressed, manufacturers like Candie's stretched the envelope of what was considered too outrageous to wear, while others, like Famolare and Cherokee of California, introduced \\"comfort\\" platforms, designed to combine the added height of platforms with the support and comfort of sneakers, or even orthopedic shoes, and by the time the fad finally fizzled in the late 1980s, girls and women of all ages were wearing them. It may also be a by-product of this fad that Scandinavian clogs, which were considered rather outrageous in the late 1960s and early 1970s, had become classic by the 1980s.  1990s  Vivienne Westwood, the UK fashion designer, re-introduced the high heeled platform shoe into high fashion in the early 1990s; it was while wearing a pair of Super-Elevated Gillie with five-inch platforms and nine-inch heels that the supermodel Naomi Campbell fell on the catwalk at a fashion show. However, they did not catch on quickly and platform shoes only began to resurface in mainstream fashion in the late 1990s, thanks in part to the UK band the Spice Girls. The all-girl group was often seen in tall platform sneakers and boots. The footwear brand Buffalo created the famous platform sneakers worn by members of the group. The United Kingdom (and European) experience of platform shoes was somewhat different from that of the United States. the long pointed shoes of the early 2000s, giving an elongated look to the foot, have been more popular in the US than in the UK. =21st century=  2000s  The platform shoe resurfaced in popularity in the early 2000s when the YSL Tribute Sandal appeared in 2004, quickly gaining popularity by celebrities and the fashion world for its sex appeal and added comfort of a platform sole. The shoe is continued to be released season after season, despite changes in creative directors.  2010s  During the late 2010s, platform boots became fashionable due to a resurgence of interest in 1970s fashion. These included so-called \\"nothing shoes\\" with clear Perspex soles, and mule sandals.

However, on December 11, 2007, it was announced that Barlow had officially re-joined Iced Earth and would be singing on The Crucible of Man and following albums. Pyramaze confirmed that he would remain with them to record their album Immortal, but that their professional relationship would end there. On March 3, 2011, Matt Barlow announced that he will again be leaving Iced Earth after the band finishes its European festival shows, citing his commitment to his family and the need for Iced Earth to tour more as his reasons for retirement. On August 6, Barlow performed his farewell show with Iced Earth at the Wacken Open Air festival. On June 26, 2012, Barlow announced on his Facebook page the creation of a new band named Ashes of Ares with former Iced Earth bassist Freddie Vidales and Nevermore drummer Van Williams, posting on YouTube two one-minute teaser videos. The band signed with Nuclear Blast, and the self-titled album released on September 6, 2013. In May 2013, Barlow contributed vocals to American power metal band Artizan's album Ancestral Energy, being featured on the album's final track. On January 1, 2017 a joint project with Jonah Weingarten of Pyramaze named We are Sentinels was announced by Barlow on his Facebook page.

During the American Civil War, Pierrepont was a Democrat, although he supported President Abraham Lincoln. Pierrepont initially supported President Andrew Johnson's conservative Reconstruction efforts having opposed the Radical Republicans. In both 1868 and 1872, Pierrepont supported Ulysses S. Grant for President. For his support, President Grant appointed Pierrepont United States Attorney in 1869. In 1871, Pierrepont gained the reputation as a solid reformer, having joined New York's Committee of Seventy that shut down Boss Tweed's corrupt Tammany Hall. In 1872, Pierrepont modified his views on Reconstruction and stated that African American freedman's rights needed to be protected.Pierrepont (September 25, 1872), Speech of the Hon. Edwards Pierrepont, pg. 23 In April 1875, Pierrepont was appointed U.S. Attorney General by President Grant, who, having teamed up with Secretary of Treasury Benjamin Bristow, vigorously prosecuted the notorious Whiskey Ring, a national tax evasion swindle that involved whiskey distillers, brokers, and government officials, including President Grant's private secretary, Orville E. Babcock. Upon his appointment, Pierrepont quickly cleaned up corruption in Southern U.S. districts. Pierrepont had continued former Attorney General George H. Williams moratorium on prosecuting the Ku Klux Klan. The Klan had been previously prosecuted by President Grant's Attorneys General Amos T. Akerman and Williams from 1871 to 1873, prosecuting civil rights violations of whites against African Americans. Pierrepont ruled that a naturalized Prussian immigrant's son born in the U.S. was not obligated to serve in the Prussian military as an adult. In his ruling of the Chorpenning Claim, Pierrepont cited the Supreme Court case Gorden v United States, having agreed that the Postmaster General, as well as the Secretary of War, served as ministers rather than legally binding arbitrators for a monetary claim by a private citizen. After serving as Attorney General, Pierrepont was appointed Minister to Great Britain by President Grant serving from 1876 to 1877. After many visits to France, Pierrepont became an advocate for bimetalism. Having returned from England, Pierrepont resumed his law practice until his death in 1892. Early life and ancestry James Pierepont Oil portrait, Pierpont Limner, 1711 Edwards Pierrepont was born in North Haven, Connecticut on March 4, 1817. His was the son of Giles Pierepont and Eunice Munson Pierepont. Giles Pierepont was a New England descendant of James Pierepont, a cofounder of Yale University. Pierrepont's baptised name was Munson Edwards Pierepont, however, he changed his name to Edwards Pierrepont, dropping Munson and adding an extra \\"r\\" to his last name. Pierrepont was an earlier version of his family name. Pierrepont attend several schools in the North Haven area, enrolled at Yale University, and graduated in 1837. After graduation, Edwards traveled and explored the West, then studied at New Haven Law School. He passed the bar in 1840, and tutored at Yale University from 1840 to 1841. He then moved to Columbus, Ohio where he practiced law with Phineas B. Wilcox from 1840 to 1845. In 1846, Pierrepont moved to New York where he established his own practice. Marriages, family, and estates On May 27, 1846, Pierrepont married Margaretta Willoughby, from Brooklyn, the daughter of Samuel Willoughby. Their marriage produced two children, one son, Edwin, and one daughter, Margaretta. Edwin died in Rome in 1885 while serving as Charg√© d'Affaires, having replaced Mr. William Astor, the U.S. Envoy, who had retired. Pierrepont's daughter married Leanord F. Beckwith who lived at 48 West Seventy-second Street in New York. In 1852, Pierrepont completed the construction of his estate house at 103 Fifth Avenue in New York. This would be his permanent residence for the next 40 years. In 1867, Pierrepont built a country estate house in Garrison, designed by architect Alexander Jackson Davis; it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 as the Hurst-Pierrepont Estate. Political career Upon moving to New York, Pierrepont became active in politics, having joined the Democratic Party in 1846. Pierrepont first served in office when he was elected Superior Court Judge on the New York Supreme Court; he served from 1857 to 1860. Civil War Pierrepont was believed to have a pulse on the nation and served as Abraham Lincoln's personal advisor before and after Lincoln was elected President.West's Encyclopedia of American Law (2005), \\"Pierrepont, Edwards\\" p. 446, vol. 2 In 1862, during the Civil War Pierrepont was appointed by President Lincoln a member of the military commission to try the cases of state prisoners in the custody of the federal military authorities. During the Presidential election of 1864, Pierrepont supported Lincoln in a political speech at Cooper Union, believing President Lincoln would secure the restoration of the Union. Pierrepont stated Lincoln stood for freedom, liberty and national glory. Prosecuted Surratt trial John H. Surratt In 1867 Pierrepont conducted the case for the government against John H. Surratt, indicted as an accomplice in the murder of President Lincoln. Surratt, a former Confederate spy, was the last person to be tried by a U.S. Military commission in the case of Lincoln's assassination. After Lincoln's assassination, Surratt fled the United States to Montreal, Liverpool, Rome, and was finally caught in Egypt on December 2, 1866, where he was indicted and returned to the United States to face U.S. military trial. The trial opened on June 10, 1867 under Judge George P. Fisher and held immense public interest in the United States. Pierrepont argued that Surratt was involved in the conspiracy to overthrow the U.S. Government and involved with the assassination of Abraham Lincoln by John Wilkes Booth.Washington Government Printing Office (1867), Argument of Hon. Edwards Pierrepont to the jury: on the trial of John H. Surratt For the Murder of President Lincoln, pp. 4‚Äì5 Pierrepont argued that the military trial was suited for Surratt's case and quoted Bible verses that he viewed supported government was created by God for the express purpose of finding the guilty.Washington Government Printing Office (1867), Argument of Hon. Edwards Pierrepont to the jury: on the trial of John H. Surratt For the Murder of President Lincoln, pp. 7‚Äì8 Pierrepont argued that because Surratt had assumed an alias name, John Harrison, in staying at a hotel, and had fled the country that this proved his guilt.Washington Government Printing Office (1867), Argument of Hon. Edwards Pierrepont to the jury: on the trial of John H. Surratt For the Murder of President Lincoln, pp. 10‚Äì11 The trial lasted until August 10, 1867 and ended with the jury unable to make any decision after a seventy-hour deliberation. As a result of the hung jury, Judge Fisher set Surratt free. New York constitutional convention member In April 1867, Pierrepont was elected a member of the New York Constitutional Convention serving on the Judiciary Committee. A total of 19 committees were created to study each constitutional revision with Pierrepont's larger Judiciary Committee having a total of 15 members. The Constitutional Convention turned out to be a long drawn-out process of deliberation that lasted into June 1867 whose purpose was to root out any constitutional defects from the previous 1846 New York Constitution. One contentious issue was whether to allow women suffrage and to strike out the word \\"male\\" that defined New York voters. U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York From April 25, 1869 to July 20, 1870 Pierrepont served as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York appointed by President Ulysses S. Grant. As U.S. Attorney, he prosecuted Cuban revolutionaries for violation of the Neutrality Act. On Tuesday June 15, 1869, U.S. Attorney Pierrepont arrested and indicted members of the Cuban Junta, an organization to aid the Cuban Rebellion. Included in the arrests were the Cuban Junta President and other members; Jose Moralez Lemus, Wm. O.C. Ryan, Francisco Fesser, and Jose Mora. The Cuban Junta on May 1, 1869 had organized a military expedition to fight in the Cuban Rebellion against Spain. Other members of the Cuban Junta escaped arrest by the Deputy Marshall Allan. Pierrepont retired as U.S. Attorney and resumed his private law practice. Committee of Seventy member Nast cartoon that lampooned Boss Tweed's Tammany Hall Ring. After the American Civil War the Democratic Party under Boss William Tweed's Tammany Hall gained a monopoly in both New York City Hall and the New York Legislature. Allegations of corruption rapidly grew as rumors spread that Boss Tweed and associates of Tammany Hall were laundering tax payers money in real estate and bribing New York State legislatures for favorable legislation. New York City workers under the Tammany Hall system were paid excessive rates on the burden of tax payers. By 1871, New York City residents and the press demanded that the corruption be investigated and cleaned up. On September 4, at Cooper Union, a large organization of reputed citizens was formed known as the Committee of Seventy, that investigated the corruption of Boss Tweed's Tammany Hall Ring. Pierrepont was appointed to and actively served on the legislation commission of the Committee of Seventy. The Committee of Seventy promised to thoroughly investigate Tammany Hall corruption and strongly encouraged honest voters to stop taking bribes from Tammany Hall at the polls during election. By the end of October 1871 the Committee of Seventy had successfully stopped funding Boss Tweed's Tammany Hall by court injunction effectively shutting down the corrupt institution. Tweed was arrested and thrown into jail. Supported President Grant  President Ulysses S. Grant ‚ÄîMathew Brady 1869 On September 25, 1872 reformer Pierrepont gave a speech at the Cooper Union Institute in New York that supported President Grant's reelection.Pierrepont (September 25, 1872), Speech of the Hon. Edwards Pierrepont, p. 1 Pierrepont stated that Grant's opponent Horace Greeley had pointed out that Grant had made a better President than expected and that his second term would be better than his first.Pierrepont (September 25, 1872), Speech of the Hon. Edwards Pierrepont, p. 22 Pierrepont stated that President Grant had been unjustly slandered by the press, and that he believed \\"security, confidence, development and unexampled prosperity\\" would take place during President Grant's second term in office. Pierrepont, who had toured the South in February, spoke on President Grant's Reconstruction policy.Pierrepont (September 25, 1872), Speech of the Hon. Edwards Pierrepont, p. 23 Pierrepont had observed that southern whites in poverty supported Greeley, while African Americans were loyal to President Grant. Although acknowledging Reconstruction state governments needed reform, Pierrepont blamed southern poverty on the Southern peoples \\"swollen pride and obstinate will\\". Pierrepont believed that Grant's southern policy was good for the Southern people; that African Americans needed to be protected in their rights; and that government needed to govern justly and generously. Pierrepont believed that electing Greeley would turn over the state governments to a rebellious people and reminded his audience of Union prisoner deaths that had taken place at Andersonville and harsh conditions at Libby Prison. As a reformer, Pierrepont stated he would do his best to ensure that honest men were placed around President Grant.Pierrepont (September 25, 1872), Speech of the Hon. Edwards Pierrepont, pp. 21‚Äì22 On October 11, 1872 Edwards Pierrepont spoke in Ithaca, New York supporting President Grant and the Republican ticket. Pierrepont related a story of President Grant unworried he would not win North Carolina. Although there was concern that Grant would not win North Carolina, Pierrepont stated that Grant had said to a friend when wolves howl at night the sound is greater than the actual number of wolves. According to President Grant, this was the case in North Carolina. Pierrepont predicted Grant would win New York for seven reasons including that Grant had already won the state in 1868 when the Democratic coalition was at its height, the Republicans had carried the state government, and that Grant would receive 17,000 votes from African Americans. Pierrepont stated the Tammany Ring would no longer be instrumental in securing the Democratic vote through fraud. Pierrepont had earlier been instrumental in prosecuting the Tammany Ring that was completely shut down. With the prosecution of the Ku Klux Klan by President Grant and Pierrepont's shutting down the Tammany Ring, the general election of 1872 was one of the most fair in United States history. Saint-Gaudens bust In 1874, Pierrepont hired a young and upcoming Irish born sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens to create a marble bust of himself. Pierrepont, who practiced phrenology, believed that having a wide head was a sign of intelligence. Pierrepont was an admirer of Plato, Socrates, and Aristotle and he wanted his head to be wide as theirs were. Pierrepont turned out to be a demanding patron as he insisted Saint- Gaudens make his head larger on the bust. Although Saint-Gaudens complied, he was upset at Pierrepont for having to make his head larger. Saint-Gaudens said that Pierrepont's bust \\"seemed to be affected with some dreadful swelling disease\\". Saint-Gaudens was so upset over the Pierrepont portrait sculpture that he later stated to a friend, David Armstrong, he would \\"give anything to get hold of that bust and smash it to atoms\\". U.S. Attorney General President Ulysses S. Grant appointed Pierrepont Attorney General of the United States on April 26, 1875. A former Democrat, Pierrepont had difficulty fitting into the Grant Administration, as stress was created during his tenure because of the prosecution of the Whiskey Ring and the indictment of Grant's private secretary, American Civil War general, Orville E. Babcock. Pierrepont, a reformer, was teamed up by President Grant with Secretary of Treasury, Benjamin Bristow to rid the government of corruption. Sec. Bristow had discovered whiskey distillers had created a government ring that profiteered by evading payment of taxes on the manufacturing of whiskey. Pierrepont was also involved with Reconstruction, as President Grant administered Southern policy through the Attorney General's Justice Department and the War Department. In terms of southern Reconstruction, Pierrepont continued his predecessors Att. Gen. George H. Williams's Spring, 1873 moratorium of prosecuting civil rights cases and in general was unresponsive to white violent attacks or outrages against African American citizens in the South. Pierrepont was more concerned for the restoration of the United States \\"international influence and political clout\\" after the American Civil War and was primarily known for his rulings on international law, naturalization, and extradition. To change his Cabinet coalition, President Grant removed Pierrepont as Attorney General and appointed him minister to Great Britain.  Reforms (1875) When Pierrepont assumed the office of U.S. Attorney General, he immediately implemented overdue reform in the South's U.S. Marshal and U.S. Attorney departments. The culmination of these reforms took place in June 1875. Attorney General Pierrepont had given specific reform orders to U.S. Attorneys and U.S. Marshals in the South that were vigorously enforced. Pierrepont ran extensive investigations into the conduct of the U.S. Attorneys and U.S. Marshals, exposing fraud and corruption. Pierrepont was fully sustained by President Grant's endorsement of the investigations, reforms, and persons to be removed and replaced from office. Naturalization (1875) In July 1875 Attorney General Pierrepont ruled on the naturalization case of the son of a Prussian immigrant, Steinkoanler, who had immigrated to the United States in 1848. Steinkoanler was naturalized as a United States citizen in 1854. Steinkoanler returned to Prussia with his son, born in the United States, who was four years old. The naturalization case concerned whether Steinkoanler's son, who was then 20 years old, had to serve in the Prussian military, an obligation for all Prussian male children. Pierrepont ruled that Steinkoanler's son, had both United States and Prussian citizenship, and was only obligated to serve in the Prussian military while under his father's care. However, after Steinkoanler had come of age on his own, he was free to return to the United States and as a U.S. citizen could even run for the President of the United States. Chorpenning claim (1875) On July 25, 1875, Attorney General Pierrepont ruled on what was denounced as a fraud known as the Chorpenning claim. Chorpenning had petitioned the post office in 1857 for payment of mail delivery in San Pedro and Carson's Valley. Chorpenning was paid $109,072.95 by Postmaster General Aaron V. Brown in 1857 for his postal services, however Chorpening, under protest, believed he deserved more compensation. On July 15, 1870, Congress authorized the Postmaster General to adjust the Chorpenning claim. On December 23, 1870, Grant's Postmaster General John A. J. Creswell ruled that Chorpenning was owed a $443,010.60 adjustment. On January 12, 1871 a House committee suspended payment to Chorpenning. On February 9, 1871 Congress repealed the July 15, 1870 law that allowed the Postmaster General to adjust the Chorpenning claim. On March 3, 1871 Congress forbid that any appropriations go to pay the Chorpenning claim. On May 8, 1872 Congress again forbid any appropriations to pay for the Chorpening claim. Pierrepont ruled that Postmaster General Creswell was not an arbitrator between Chorpenning and Congress. Chorpenning's legal counsel argued that Congress was bound to pay any contracts between Congress and a private citizen. Pierrepont argued citing Gordon v United States that the Postmaster served as in a ministerial position rather than judicial, and therefore Creswell's adjustment was not binding. Pierrepont referred the Chorpening claim to the Court of Collections and allowed the next Congress to decide the fate of the Chorpening claim, unless the statute of limitations stopped the claim.  Mississippi (1875)  President Grant's Reconstruction policy worked through the U.S. Attorney General and the Justice Department, in addition to the Secretary of War and the War Department.Smith (2001), Grant, p. 542 During later Reconstruction white supremacists known as white liners in both the North and the South put pressure on the Grant Administration to limit the use of deployed troops in the South that protected African American citizens under the Reconstruction Act of 1867.McFeely (1981), Grant A Biography, pp 418‚Äì419 Previously President Grant had destroyed the Ku Klux Klan under the Enforcement Acts in 1871. Resistance continued and resurged as white liners violently attacked Mississippi blacks in 1875.McFeely (1981), Grant A Biography, p. 420 Republican Governor Adelbert Ames requested troops to protect black voters. In order to avoid violence, Attorney General Pierrepont sent George K. Chase to Mississippi who met with white liner leaders to hold them to their previous pledge not to use violence during the election. President Grant and Att. Gen. Pierrepont told Governor Ames to use federal troops only if the white liners used violence on election day. No violence took place on election day, however, the intimidation tactics of the white liners prior to the election kept blacks and Republican voters from the polls.McFeely (1981), Grant A Biography, pp. 423‚Äì424 Whiskey Ring (1875‚Äì1876)  A cartoon that lampooned the Whiskey Ring. After the American Civil War, whiskey distillers in St. Louis developed a tax evasion ring that depleted the U.S. Treasury. By 1875, the Whiskey Ring had grown into a nationwide criminal syndicate that included whiskey distillers, brokers, and government officials; making enormous profits from the sale of untaxed whiskey. Also rumored, was that in 1872 the Ring had secretly funded the Republican Presidential campaign. In an effort of reform and to clean up corruption, President Ulysses S. Grant appointed Benjamin Bristow, as U.S. Secretary of Treasury in 1874, who immediately discovered millions of dollars were being depleted from the U.S. Treasury.Smith (1981), Grant, p. 584 Under orders from President Grant, in May 1875, Sec. Bristow struck hard at the Ring, nationally shutting down distilleries, arresting hundreds involved in the ring having obtained over 350 indictments. The Ring through Bristow's vigorous raids had been effectively shut down. In April 1875, President Grant appointed Pierrepont Attorney General and teamed him up with Bristow to prosecute the Ring and clean up corruption.Smith (2001), Grant, p. 585 Pierrepont and the Justice Department created by Grant prosecuted the Whiskey Ring. Under orders from Grant Pierrepont controversially sent circular letters to district attorneys in Milwaukee, Chicago, and St. Louis denying immunity to offenders who would testify against the ring. Pierrepont's prosecution of the ring however was viewed satisfactory by the public. During the Summer of 1875, both Bristow and Pierrepont obtained President Grant's order to \\"let know guilty man escape\\". During the Fall of 1875, evidence was discovered that Grant's private secretary, Orville Babcock had been involved in the Ring. Bristow and Pierrepont, stayed behind after a cabinet meeting with President Grant and showed him correspondence between Babcock and William Joyce in St. Louis, indicted in the Ring, cryptic telegram messages as evidence of Babcock's involvement in the Ring. Babcock was summoned to the Oval Office for an explanation and was told to send a telegram to bring Wilson to Washington, D.C. After Babcock did not return to the Oval Office, Pierrepont discovered Babcock was in the process of writing a letter warning Wilson to be on his guard. This angered Attorney General Pierrepont, who spilled ink over Babcock's letter and shouted, \\"You don't want to send your argument; send the fact, and go there and make your explanation. I do not understand it.\\"McFeely (1981), Grant A Biography, p. 411 Babcock was indicted and later acquitted in a trial in St. Louis, after an oral deposition from President Grant defending Babcock was given to the jury. The Justice Department obtained 110 convictions of persons involved in the Whiskey Ring. In March 1876, a rumor spread throughout Washington, D.C., that Attorney General Pierrepont had given information to aid the defense counsel of Orville Babcock in St. Louis. Pierrepont publicly denied the allegation in a letter to Scott Lord and stated the rumor was \\"an infamous falsehood\\". Pierrepont suspected that Gen. Babcock himself was the source of the rumor. Babcock was dismissed as Grant's personal secretary after Babcock's acquittal in St. Louis. Pierrepont also denied the rumor that himself and Secretary Bristow were at odds with each other. Pierrepont produced a letter from October 1875 to Bluford Wilson, Bristow's assistant during the Whiskey Ring raids, that proved Bristow and Pierrepont were working together in harmony during the Whiskey Ring prosecutions. U.S. Minister to Britain Queen Victoria On May 22, 1876 President Grant appointed Pierrepont Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States to Britain, having replaced Robert Schenck, serving until December 1, 1877.McFeely, p. 439 While serving as minister to Britain, Pierrepont became interested in bimetalism, frequently traveling to France, a bimetalist country.The Atlanta Constitution (April 29, 1886), \\"Edwards Pierreont The Distinguished Ex-Minister Visits the Gate City\\", p. 8 On June 5, 1877 Pierrepont gave a reception for former President Ulysses S. Grant at his elaborate house on Cavendish Square. The Prince of Wales Edward Albert, Foreign Secretary Lord Derby Edward Stanley, William Gladstone and his wife Catherine, and American journalist Kate Field attended the formal affair.McFeely, p. 455 Although Grant was well received by the British public, a diplomatic controversy was caused when British officials including Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli told Pierrepont that as a former head of state, Grant was nothing more than a \\"commoner\\", and could not be recognized by the government. Lord Derby, minister of foreign affairs, told Pierrepont that since Grant had no formal rank in the United States, he had none in Britain. Pierrepont countered Derby saying that first Napoleon had been elected ruler, not by hereditary lineage, and yet the succeeding Bonaparte emperors were recognized by England: \\"Once an Emperor always an Emperor.\\" Therefore, the same precedent applied to an elected head of state: \\"Once a President always a President.\\" Grant's diplomatic recognition, although informal, came when Queen Victoria invited him to Windsor Castle. The Grants accepted, and on June 26, 1877 Pierrepont introduced the former president to the Queen.McFeely, p. 458 She received them in an appropriate setting, the castle's magnificent 520 feet quadrangle. After his tenure as Minister Plenipotentiary ended, Pierrepont returned to the United States and resumed his private legal practice in New York. Transcontinental trip to Alaska Wrangell Harbor, Alaska 1897 In 1883, at the age of 66, Pierrepont and his son Edwin Willoughby Pierrepont took a transcontinental trip to the far reaches of Alaska starting from New York.West's Encyclopedia of American Law (2005), \\"Pierrepont, Edwards\\" p. 447, vol. 2 On July 25 Pierrepont and Edwin visited Fort Wrangell, having sailed by ship into Wrangell Harbor.Edward Pierrepont (1884), Fifth Avenue to Alaska, pp. 179‚Äì180 Edwin was impressed by the mirror reflection of the snow-capped mountains in the harbor waters. Upon their return, Pierrepont and Edwin published a widespread paper titled, \\"Fifth Avenue to Alaska\\" in 1884. Edwin was awarded a fellowship to the Royal Geographical Society of England. The long trip took a health toll on him and he died in 1885. Visited Atlanta Kimball House 1890 On August 28, 1886, Pierrepont and his wife visited Atlanta, Georgia, staying at the Kimball House. The year before Pierrepont had submitted a letter published by The Atlanta Constitution on bimetalism, a topic of popular discussion during the 1880s. Pierrepont favored a bimetalist economy believing that having two metal currencies would alleviate poverty and would keep a few wealthy businessmen from monopolizing a single gold standard currency. While in Atlanta, Pierrepont stated that the relations between the North and the South had improved and that the Southerners bore no ill will to the North. Pierrepont believed Atlanta was a model city for Southern industrialization. The Pierreponts toured the South in search of a place to improve Margaretta's health condition. Mrs. Pierrepont had suffered from grief after the death of their son Edwin, who had died of a fever in Rome in 1885. Illness, death, funeral Calvary Church, on March 9, 1892. According to The New York Times, in late 1889, Pierrepont suffered a nervous disease that \\"deprived him of the use of his limbs\\". Although Pierrepont was an invalid, for the next two and one-half years he was able to carry on most of his law practice and travel back and forth from his New York residence to his mansion in Garrison. On Wednesday, March 2, 1892, Pierrepont suffered a massive stroke that paralyzed the right side of his body and he lost the ability to speak. Four days later on March 6, Pierrepont died in the house in New York he had built 40 years earlier. The funeral services were done by Rev. Dr. Henry Y. Satterlee at Calvary Church on Wednesday March 9, at 10 am. Pierrepont's body was transferred to Garrison where he was buried at St. Philip's Cemetery, accompanied by 10 prominent pall bearers. Reputation Pierrepont is primarily known for his success as an attorney appearing for well-known clients in important cases, and for fighting political corruption in federal, state, and city offices. This includes his successful prosecution and shutting down the Whiskey Ring, a national tax evasion syndicate, from 1875 to 1876. Politically, Pierrepont's success relied mainly on his appointments to office by President Ulysses S. Grant to U.S. Attorney for New York, U.S. Attorney General, and U.S. Minister to Great Britain. Pierrepont is also known for his publications of pamphlets on financial questions, mainly supporting bimetallic standard of U.S. currency. Although Pierrepont's tenure as Attorney General took place during Reconstruction, his primary interest at the Justice Department was ruling on cases that determined the rights of U.S. citizens abroad. Certain Supreme Court rulings against the Enforcement Acts signed into law by President Grant, hampered Pierrepont's enforcement of civil rights in the United States.

Blaze was featured in the Ghost Rider series from 1972 to 1983. The subsequent Ghost Rider series (1990‚Äì1998) featured Danny Ketch as a new Ghost Rider. After his sister was injured by ninja gangsters, Ketch came in contact with a motorcycle that had somehow been mystically enchanted to contain the essence of a Spirit of Vengeance. Blaze reappeared in this 1990s series as a supporting character, and it was later revealed that Danny and his sister were Johnny Blaze's long-lost siblings. In 2000s comics, Blaze briefly again became the Ghost Rider, succeeding Ketch. In 2013, Robbie Reyes became Ghost Rider as part of the Marvel NOW! initiative. In May 2011, Ghost Rider placed 90th on IGN's \\"Top 100 Comic Book Heroes\\" list. Nicolas Cage starred as the Johnny Blaze iteration of the character in the 2007 film Ghost Rider and its 2012 sequel, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance. Gabriel Luna played Robbie Reyes in the television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Fictional character biography Johnny Blaze Following the western comics character who originally used the name, the first superhero Ghost Rider, Johnny Blaze, debuted in Marvel Spotlight issue #5 (August 1972), created by Marvel editor- in-chief Roy Thomas, writer Gary Friedrich and artist Mike Ploog. He received his own series in 1973, with penciller Jim Mooney handling most of the first nine issues. Several different creative teams mixed-and-matched until penciller Don Perlin began a considerably long stint with issue #26, eventually joined by writer Michael Fleisher through issue #58. The series ran through issue #81 (June 1983). Blaze returned as Ghost Rider in a 2001 six- issue miniseries written by Devin Grayson; a second miniseries written by Garth Ennis in 2005, and an ongoing monthly series that began publication in July 2006. Johnny Blaze was the son of Naomi Blaze and Barton Blaze, Naomi being the previous Ghost Rider. Noble Kale He would become the first Ghost Rider. Noble lived in the eighteenth century and grew up with his abusive father Pastor Kale and his younger brother Dante. Noble fell in love with a black girl named Magdelena. But, because of the color of her skin and his father‚Äôs strong religious views, the couple kept their love a secret from the world. They were forced to tell Pastor Kale when Magdelena bore Noble‚Äôs child. Noble and Magdelena were then married. Shortly after the marriage, Magdelena discovered Pastor Kale‚Äôs dark secret; he was a servant of the dark lord Mephisto. In order to cover up Magdelena‚Äôs findings, Pastor Kale accused her of witchcraft and had her burned at the stake. Knowing that his son, Noble, would object, he had him drugged, tortured and beaten in the church cellar. Just before Magdelena died, she used a curse to summon demons that avenge wronged women. The demons were called \\"Furies\\" and they started killing the townspeople. Fearing death, Pastor Kale struck a deal with Mephisto. In return for his safety, Mephisto got Noble‚Äôs soul. Mephisto realized that Noble was attached to a piece of the Medallion of power, and he activated the piece to transform Noble into the original \\"Spirit of Vengeance.\\" When Ghost Rider had destroyed the Furies, Pastor offered him human flesh - Noble's son. Noble, in the guise of Ghost Rider, was unwilling to eat his own child, and he killed himself. When Mephisto later appeared to claim Noble's soul, Mephisto's brother, the archangel Uriel, appeared and demanded that the soul of Noble Kale be spared. No agreement could be reached, and therefore a compromise was made whereby Noble's soul could not be claimed by either realm; but instead, his soul would remain in the void until rebonded with certain members of his family.Flashback - Ghost Rider #1 (July 1997) Noble Kale was also established as an ancestor of Jennifer Kale.Ghost Rider #82 Danny Ketch The next Ghost Rider, a young man named Daniel \\"Danny\\" Ketch (Johnny Blaze's long lost little brother), debuted in Ghost Rider vol. 2, #1 (May 1990). This Ghost Rider was nearly identical to the previous, although his costume was now a black leather biker jacket with spiked shoulder-pads, grey leather pants, and a mystic chain he wore across his chest, which responded to his mental commands and served as his primary melee weapon. His new motorcycle resembled a futuristic machine and the front of it could lower to serve as a battering ram. Like the original Ghost Rider's bike, the wheels were composed of mystic hellfire. Unlike the relationship between the previous Ghost Rider and the demon with which he was bonded, Ketch and his demon‚Äîwho in vol. 2, #91 (December 1997) is revealed to be Marvel's incarnation of the Angel of Death/Judgment‚Äîare cooperative with each other. At the close of the series with vol. 2, #93 (Feb. 1998), Ketch apparently died. The following year, however, Peter Parker: Spider-Man #93 (July 1999) revealed Ketch was still alive. Nearly a decade later, Marvel published the long-completed final issue as Ghost Rider Finale (Jan. 2007), which reprints the last issue and the previously unpublished #94.While the trademarked cover logo reads Ghost Rider #94, the comic's postal indicia lists the comic copyrighted as Ghost Rider Finale. Alejandra Jones During the 2011 storyline \\"Fear Itself\\", a Nicaraguan woman named Alejandra Jones becomes Ghost Rider through a ritual performed by a man named Adam. Though she demonstrates many previously unknown powers of the Ghost Rider entity, she is deprived of its full power when Johnny Blaze takes back most of this power. Robbie Reyes In 2013, a new character took on the Ghost Rider mantle: a Mexican-American resident of East Los Angeles named Roberto \\"Robbie\\" Reyes, who drives a black classic muscle car reminiscent of a modified 1969 Dodge Charger rather than a motorcycle.Montgomery (October 13, 2013). \\"NYCC 2013: All-New Ghost Rider\\" Marvel.com. Robbie Reyes was created by writer/artist Felipe Smith and designed by Smith and artist Tradd Moore.Under The Hood Of The ALL-NEW GHOST RIDER Character Design and is without a doubt the trashiest version of ghost rider every created.(February 10, 2014). . Cosmic Ghost Rider In the alternate reality of Earth-TRN666, where Thanos conquered all the Universe, Frank Castle's early life was seemingly similar to that of the Frank Castle of the Earth-616 Universe. However, when Thanos came to Earth, the Punisher was one of the last casualties during the last stand of the heroes and his soul was subsequently sent to Hell. Willing to give anything in order to punish Thanos for slaughtering his planet, the Punisher signed a demonic deal with Mephisto and became the Ghost Rider. When he returned to Earth, however, Thanos was already gone and everything on the planet was dead. Roaming endlessly and undying with no one to kill or love, the Ghost Rider spent the next countless years alone. He eventually began to lose his mind when even Mephisto fell silent to his calls. When a badly injured Galactus arrived on Earth seeking help against Thanos, unaware that the population of Earth had already been killed by him, the Ghost Rider offered the dead planet to him in exchange for the chance of punishing the Mad Titan as his herald which the Great Devourer accepted. Bestowed with the Power Cosmic, Ghost Rider became Cosmic Ghost Rider.Thanos Vol. 2 #13. Marvel Comics. Ghost / The Rider Due to the Celestial Progenitor presence influencing human evolution, in 1,000,000 B.C., certain humans became much more intelligent than others as well as able to speak a new language. However, they had to hide that gift from their brethren for fear of being ostracized. One day, a boy that was gifted with the ability to speak is approached by a mysterious stranger that also possessed that gift, only to witness the stranger transform into a beast and devour his entire tribe. The stranger allowed the boy to live and names him \\"Ghost\\" before telling him to challenge him when he is worthy. The boy was forced to survive on his own, though he does befriend a woolly mammoth. After almost dying in the harsh environment, he is approached by Mephisto in the form of a snake, who tells him to say its name. Ghost does that and is bonded with a Spirit of Vengeance; after which he imbued his newly acquired hellfire into the mammoth. Other humans had never seen someone ride an animal before and began referring to Ghost as \\"The Rider\\". The Rider continued his search and five years later, eventually caught up with the man who devoured his tribe. The man transformed once more, revealing himself to be the first Wendigo. During the fight, the Rider took the bones of the dead that Wendigo had killed and used them to form a weapon; the earliest version of Ghost Rider's signature chain. The Rider fought Wendigo until finally it and the Rider's woolly mammoth tumbled over a cliff. Afterwards, Ghost was approached by Odin and Lady Phoenix to join the prehistoric version of the Avengers.Avengers Vol. 8 #7. Marvel Comics. Upon imbuing his hellfire into another woolly mammoth, Ghost Rider assisted the prehistoric Avengers (consisting of Agamotto, Odin, Lady Phoenix, and prehistoric versions of Black Panther, Iron Fist, and Star Brand) in fighting an out of control Celestial called the Fallen; which resulted in his woolly mammoth getting killed in action. Ghost Rider swore revenge and assisted his teammates in defeating the Fallen and sealing it away underground in what would become South Africa.Marvel Legacy #1. Marvel Comics. Ghost Rider later assisted the prehistoric Avengers in fighting the First Host.Avengers Vol. 8 #4. Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities The Ghost Rider is a human who can transform into a skeletal superhuman wreathed in ethereal flame and given supernatural powers. The motorcycle he rides can travel faster than any conventional vehicle and can perform seemingly impossible feats such as riding up a vertical surface, across water, and leaping across great distances that normal motorcycles cannot. The Ghost Riders are virtually indestructible and notoriously hard to injure by any conventional means, as bullets and knives usually pass through them without causing pain (knives are shown to melt while in their body).Ghost Rider (2007 film) It is possible that they are genuinely immortal, as it is said that God created them and only God can destroy them.Ghost Riders: Heavens On Fire #6 Despite being composed of bone and hellfire, the Ghost Riders possess formidable superhuman strength, enough to easily pick up a truck and hurl it across a road. It has been stated that Johnny Blaze as Ghost Rider can press around 25 tons (50,000 lbs) (or more as seen in World War Hulk).All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #4 Each Ghost Rider entity also had abilities specific to him or her. ; Johnny Blaze: Originally when Blaze transformed into Ghost Rider, his body changed but not the clothes he was wearing. In his new incarnation, this is different and his clothes take on a different appearance with a spiked leather jacket and chains. As Ghost Rider, he can cause his motorcycle to transform and surround itself with hellfire or he can create a new cycle from pure hellfire. He is also capable of projecting hellfire as a weapon. His hellfire \\"burns the soul\\" without leaving physical injuries on the victim and its effects have been seen as similar to the \\"Penance Stare.\\" In his new incarnation, Blaze is now possibly the most powerful hero on Earth. During \\"World War Hulk\\", it was stated by Doctor Strange that Ghost Rider might be equally as powerful as the \\"Green Scar\\" persona of Hulk and could possibly defeat him. During this series, Doctor Strange also states that Ghost Rider protects only the innocent, which none of the Illuminati are. In recent comics, Blaze's Ghost Rider has been given the \\"Penance Stare\\" and mystical chain, both of which were specific to the Danny Ketch Ghost Rider. Blaze also uses a shotgun and discovered that he can discharge hellfire from the weapon when he first encountered Ketch. Now, he also has new abilities including hellfire breath, the ability to produce chains from either his throat or chest, and the ability to travel between incorporeal realms. ; Danny Ketch: When Ketch transformed into Ghost Rider, his clothes changed with him, taking on the appearance of a spiked leather jacket with chains with a dollar, gray leather pants, and spiked gloves and boots. Likewise, his motorcycle underwent a radical transformation, changing from a conventional one into a high-tech motorcycle (this transformation was not strictly limited to the motorcycle he was found in the cemetery with as he was once seen able to transform another cycle in \\"Ghost Rider/Wolverine/Punisher: Hearts of Darkness\\"). Along with flaming wheels that allow the bike to nearly fly across surfaces, the bike included a shield-like battering ram on the front. As the Ghost Rider, Ketch used a mystical chain which responded to his mental commands. It could grow in length, alter direction while in the air, stiffen into a staff or spear, and separate into several links which can strike like shrapnel and then return to their original form. Daniel's most famous power was the Penance Stare. By locking eyes with a target and mentally focusing, the Danny Ketch Ghost Rider was able to make the target experience all the pain they had ever inflicted on anyone else. However, some beings have shown resistance to this ability, such as Venom and Carnage as their alien symbiote \\"costumes\\" do not technically have eyes; and Madcap, who is so masochistic, he claims to enjoy the experience. In the 1994 Fantastic Four animated series, this ability was shown to be powerful enough to bring down the mighty Galactus, as Ghost Rider forced Galactus to feel the pain of all those who had died as a result of his feeding on their planets; as Ghost Rider put it, \\"A billion souls\\". This display of power, though, appeared to simply be a rewrite for the animated series, as the original storyline in Fantastic Four issue 243 has Doctor Strange casting a spell that causes all of the souls of those Galactus had killed by his feedings to be visited upon him at once. Originally, this incarnation of the Ghost Rider could only be summoned if Danny was present when \\"innocent blood was spilled\\" (an innocent simply being threatened was not enough), at which time Danny had to touch the gas cap of his motorcycle for the transformation process to occur. Later, he was able to summon the Ghost Rider without touching the gas cap but still needed to wait for innocent blood to be spilled. Later still, he was able to summon the Ghost Rider by willpower alone. ; Robbie Reyes: The ghost of Eli Morrow that inhabits Robbie's body is not, according to Johnny Blaze, a true Spirit of Vengeance. Regardless, he gives Robbie several abilities similar to that of other Ghost Riders, including the power to manifest and control chains ending in thin knives or sickles.All New Ghost Rider #5 The black muscle car that Morrow's ghost initially inhabits is linked to Robbie's Ghost Rider form, allowing him to instantly teleport to and/or merge with the car. The car can also be driven remotely, and Robbie's Ghost Rider form can pass harmlessly through it, allowing it to drive into foes. The car's trunk, when opened, acts as a portal, allowing the Ghost Rider to transport anything, including people, to any location. Though it is initially unknown if Robbie's Ghost Rider form possesses the divine powers of his predecessors, he eventually displays the ability to use the Penance Stare during a battle with Star Brand.Marvel Legacy #1 Eli is able to take full control of Robbie's body when the teen gives in to his negative emotions, signified by a pallid skin tone and both of his eyes turning orange. His Ghost Rider form also displays the ability to change into a more powerful and demonic form when Robbie is sufficiently angered.Robbie Reyes: Ghost Rider #5 At the end of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s fourth season, to prevent the Darkhold from being used again, he slung his flaming chains in the same manner as a Sling Ring, allowing him to travel the Multiverse and take the book with him for safekeeping. Other Spirits of Vengeance Vengeance Michael Badilino, an ex-member of the New York City Police Department, is one-third of an \\"Organic Medallion of Power\\"; the other two are Ketch and Blaze (the Medallion itself was never explained in any true detail). He possesses powers more in line with those of the Zarathos version of Ghost Rider, although he also possesses the Penance Stare and his motorcycle seemed to share characteristics with the Noble Kale version. His appearance is distinguished by a deep purple skull, large fangs protruding from his upper jaw, and backswept curved horns on the top of his skull. In his superhuman form, Badilino was called Vengeance, and originally attempted to kill the Ghost Rider, believing him to be Zarathos. Vengeance later became the ally of Ghost Rider and Johnny Blaze. Vengeance would also take on the role of the Ghost Rider and even semi-seriously referred to himself by that name when confronted by Spider-Man shortly after the apparent death of Ghost Rider in battle with Zarathos and acolytes The Fallen. Vengeance killed himself, along with the villain Hellgate, by triggering a massive explosion through his Hellfire, the source of the mystical flames that encompass the bones of both Vengeance and Ghost Rider. Vengeance reappears in the last four issues of Ghost Rider vol. 2, involved in Blackheart's plans to kill Noble Kale. Vengeance aids the Ghost Rider in the ensuing battle, destroying Blackheart and ruling Hell during Ketch's absences. The Last Stand of the Spirits of Vengeance Seven riders show their flaming heads for the first time in this story arc by writer Jason Aaron and artist Tan Eng Huat. Daniel Ketch returns with a new mission: to collect the powers of all the Ghost Riders for the angel Zadkiel to prevent the corruption of the powers with their human hosts. Zadkiel has other motives he keeps to himself, for which he needs the powers of the riders to tear down the walls of New Jerusalem and wage war on the heavens. Trail of Tears A version of Ghost Rider appeared in the miniseries Ghost Rider: Trail of Tears #1‚Äì6 (April‚ÄìSept. 2007) by writer Garth Ennis and artist Clayton Crain. Set during the American Civil War, it finds Confederate officer Travis Parham avenging the murders of his friend, an ex- slave named Caleb and Caleb's family. Parham meets a horse-riding Ghost Rider who seeks the same men. Eventually, Parham learns about the deaths instrumental in helping set forth the Spirit of Vengeance.

Allegedly, these two appearances were also meant to serve as a backdoor pilot for a potential \\"Ghost Rider\\" animated series. * The Johnny Blaze version of Ghost Rider appears in the Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. episode \\"Spirit of Vengeance\\", voiced by Fred Tatasciore. This version is able to haunt and take control vehicles of all sizes, visualized by the vehicles catching fire and allowing weapons, such as some tanks he took over, to shoot fireballs. Unlike other versions of the Ghost Rider, this one could generate electricity and lightning from blue fire, as well as create a vortex of lightning that cured Abomination of his gamma and transformed him back into a human. However, like other versions, this one was able to make portals to other dimensions to appear on walls and other surfaces, such as a mountainside. * An army of unidentified Ghost Riders appear in the Avengers Assemble episode \\"The Wastelands.\\" They are led by Ares in his plot to keep the Avengers, the New Avengers, Doctor Strange, and Loki from activating the Bifrost Bridge in order to end the Beyonder's experiment. Video games * Ghost Rider appears in the game Venom/Spider-Man: Separation Anxiety as summonable character that assists the player for a short period of time. Separation Anxiety is the sequel to the game Spider-Man and Venom: Maximum Carnage * Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze) is featured as an unlockable character in the video game Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, voiced by Nolan North. The player receives a team bonus of \\"New Fantastic Four\\" when playing a game with a team of Ghost Rider, Spider-Man, Wolverine, Hulk and/or Luke Cage (Hulk being only available via download). * In 2007 the game Ghost Rider was made as a loose continuation of the 2007 movie of the same name. It is the only game to date that features Ghost Rider as the lead character. * He is available as downloadable content for the game LittleBigPlanet, as part of \\"Marvel Costume Kit 2\\". * Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze) appears as a non-playable character in Dante's ending in Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds. He is not available as a playable character, however he is playable in the updated version Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Richard Grieco reprises his role. * He is a playable character in Marvel Super Hero Squad Online * Ghost Rider is a playable character in Marvel: Avengers Alliance, voiced by Nolan North. * Ghost Rider is a playable character in Lego Marvel Super Heroes voiced by Andrew Kishino. * Ghost Rider is a playable character in Marvel Heroes, voiced by Andrew Kishino.

In September 2019, The Julia Hartley-Brewer Show was launched on YouTube; under the Talkradio brand, each programme is a one-to-one interview with a guest. In 2016, she supported Britain leaving the European Union during the EU referendum of that year. Resignation of Sir Michael Fallon In early October 2017, her allegations against the then Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon, recounting an incident 15 years earlier when he repeatedly touched her knee throughout a dinner in 2002, may have contributed to his eventual resignation. Omagh bomb tweet On 12 August 2018 she sent a tweet containing a photo of the aftermath of the Omagh bombing with text saying that Jeremy Corbyn had paid tribute to the victims of the bombing, \\"including the Real IRA bombers who may have snagged a nail while planting the explosives\\". The tweet was criticised as insensitive by Michael Gallagher, whose son Aidan was killed by the bomb. He said that while he wouldn't have \\"much faith\\" in Corbyn, her tweet was \\"poorly timed\\". Writer Lisa McGee criticised the use of the photo of the aftermath. Hartley-Brewer was also criticised by journalist David Blevins. She defended her tweet as satire. The 20th anniversary of the bombing was on 15 August 2018. March to Leave Rally On 29 March 2019, Hartley-Brewer spoke at the Leave Means Leave rally in Parliament Square, London. Royal College of General Practitioners NHS Question time panel The Royal College of General Practitioners invited her to speak in an \\"NHS Question Time\\" panel debate at its annual conference in 2019 but withdrew the invitation after 700 GPs signed a petition complaining that her views were not conducive to the work they were doing to promote inclusivity within the profession and amongst patients. Jolyon Maugham: address controversy In late 2019 Jolyon Maugham accused Hartley-Brewer of revealing his home address at a time when he was receiving death threats. Hartley-Brewer defended herself by saying Maugham's address was already easily available online and that he had previously revealed it himself in published interviews.

Rand considered it her most important philosophical writing. First published in installments in Rand's journal, The Objectivist, July 1966 through February 1967, the work presents Rand's proposed solution to the historic problem of universals, describes how the theory can be extended to complex cases, and outlines how it applies to other issues in the theory of knowledge. Summary Rand bases her solution to the problem of universals on a quasi- mathematical analysis of similarity. Rejecting the common view that similarity is unanalyzable, she defines similarity as: \\"the relationship between two or more existents which possess the same characteristic(s), but in different measure or degree.\\" The grasp of similarity, she holds, requires a contrast between the two or more similar items and a third item that differs from them, but differs along the same scale of measurement (which she termed a \\"Conceptual Common Denominator\\"). Thus two shades of blue, to be perceived as similar must be contrasted with something differing greatly in hue from both‚Äîe.g., a shade of red. Accordingly, Rand defines \\"concept\\" as: a \\"mental integration of two or more units possessing the same distinguishing characteristic(s) with their particular measurements omitted.\\" The monograph includes chapters outlining the Objectivist theory of how higher-order concepts are formed (\\"Abstraction from Abstraction\\"), how measurement applies to phenomena of consciousness, the nature and cognitive significance of definitions (including a defense of essence as being \\"epistemological\\" not \\"metaphysical\\"), a theory of axiomatic concepts, not axiomatic propositions, as being the base of conceptual cognition, the introduction of a \\"principle of unit economy\\" as crucial for judging and justifying and conceptual-level content, and a call for the wholesale rejection of the Kantian turn in philosophy, seeing Kant as falsely opposing the identity of consciousness to its cognitive validity‚Äîi.e., to its being conscious. \\" ... the attack on man's consciousness and particularly on his conceptual faculty has rested on the unchallenged premise that any knowledge acquired by a process of consciousness is necessarily subjective and cannot correspond to the facts of reality, since it is 'processed knowledge.' . . . \\"All knowledge is processed knowledge-- whether on the sensory, perceptual or conceptual level. An \\"unprocessed\\" knowledge would be a knowledge acquired without means of cognition. Consciousness (as I said in the first sentence of this work) is not a passive state, but an active process.\\" An additional essay by Peikoff, based on Rand's theory and edited by her, criticizes the analytic‚Äìsynthetic distinction, arguing that it stems from a wrong theory of what is included in the meaning of a concept. A concept, Rand and Peikoff maintain, includes all the characteristics possessed by the referents, not just the defining characteristics. The 1990 edition of Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology includes 200 pages of discussion between Rand and philosophy professionals, culled from tape recordings of the five \\"Workshops in Objectivist Epistemology\\" that Rand conducted in late 1969 through early 1970. The most active among those questioning Rand on the meaning and implication of her theory were John O. Nelson, George Walsh, Leonard Peikoff, Allan Gotthelf, and Harry Binswanger. About a dozen others participated to a lesser degree. Publication history Rand's title essay was originally serialized in The Objectivist from July 1966 to February 1967, then reprinted by the Nathaniel Branden Institute later in 1967 as a booklet. Peikoff's essay was first published in The Objectivist in its May 1967 to September 1967 issues. The combined book was published by New American Library in 1979. The same publisher also put out the revised edition, co-edited by Peikoff and Harry Binswanger, in 1990. Reception Both the original and revised editions of the book received relatively little attention from reviewers, although there was a review in the journal Teaching Philosophy. The work has received extensive, in-depth exposition and development in: A Companion to Ayn Rand (Blackwell Companions to Philosophy) Wiley-Blackwell: 2016, Gotthelf and Salmieri (ed.), Concepts and Their Role in Knowledge: Reflections on Objectivist Epistemology (Ayn Rand Society Philosophical Studies), and How We Know: Epistemology on an Objectivist Foundation (Binswanger, TOF Publications: 2014).

It may also be referred to as software quality control. It is normally the responsibility of software testers as part of the software development lifecycle. In simple terms, software verification is: \\"Assuming we should build X, does our software achieve its goals without any bugs or gaps?\\" On the other hand, software validation is: \\"Was X what we should have built? Does X meet the high level requirements?\\" Definitions Verification and validation are not the same things, although they are often confused. Boehm succinctly expressed the difference as * Verification: Are we building the product right? * Validation: Are we building the right product? \\"Building the product right\\" checks that the specifications are correctly implemented by the system while \\"building the right product\\" refers back to the user's needs. In some contexts, it is required to have written requirements for both as well as formal procedures or protocols for determining compliance. Building the product right implies the use of the Requirements Specification as input for the next phase of the development process, the design process, the output of which is the Design Specification. Then, it also implies the use of the Design Specification to feed the construction process. Every time the output of a process correctly implements its input specification, the software product is one step closer to final verification. If the output of a process is incorrect, the developers are not building the product the stakeholders want correctly. This kind of verification is called \\"artifact or specification verification\\". Building the right product implies creating a Requirements Specification that contains the needs and goals of the stakeholders of the software product. If such artifact is incomplete or wrong, the developers will not be able to build the product the stakeholders want. This is a form of \\"artifact or specification validation\\". Note: Verification begins before Validation and then they run in parallel until the software product is released.  Software verification  It would imply to verify if the specifications are met by running the software but this is not possible (e. g., how can anyone know if the architecture/design/etc. are correctly implemented by running the software?). Only by reviewing its associated artifacts, someone can conclude if the specifications are met.  Artifact or specification verification The output of each software development process stage can also be subject to verification when checked against its input specification (see the definition by CMMI below). Examples of artifact verification: * Of the design specification against the requirement specification: Do the architectural design, detailed design and database logical model specifications correctly implement the functional and non- functional requirement specifications? * Of the construction artifacts against the design specification: Do the source code, user interfaces and database physical model correctly implement the design specification?  Software validation Software validation checks that the software product satisfies or fits the intended use (high-level checking), i.e., the software meets the user requirements, not as specification artifacts or as needs of those who will operate the software only; but, as the needs of all the stakeholders (such as users, operators, administrators, managers, investors, etc.). There are two ways to perform software validation: internal and external. During internal software validation, it is assumed that the goals of the stakeholders were correctly understood and that they were expressed in the requirement artifacts precisely and comprehensively. If the software meets the requirement specification, it has been internally validated. External validation happens when it is performed by asking the stakeholders if the software meets their needs. Different software development methodologies call for different levels of user and stakeholder involvement and feedback; so, external validation can be a discrete or a continuous event. Successful final external validation occurs when all the stakeholders accept the software product and express that it satisfies their needs. Such final external validation requires the use of an acceptance test which is a dynamic test. However, it is also possible to perform internal static tests to find out if it meets the requirements specification but that falls into the scope of static verification because the software is not running.  Artifact or specification validation  Requirements should be validated before the software product as a whole is ready (the waterfall development process requires them to be perfectly defined before design starts; but, iterative development processes do not require this to be so and allow their continual improvement). Examples of artifact validation: * User Requirements Specification validation: User requirements as stated in a document called User Requirements Specification are validated by checking if they indeed represent the will and goals of the stakeholders. This can be done by interviewing them and asking them directly (static testing) or even by releasing prototypes and having the users and stakeholders to assess them (dynamic testing). * User input validation: User input (gathered by any peripheral such as keyboard, bio-metric sensor, etc.) is validated by checking if the input provided by the software operators or users meet the domain rules and constraints (such as data type, range, and format).  Validation vs. verification According to the Capability Maturity Model (CMMI-SW v1.1), * Software Validation: The process of evaluating software during or at the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies specified requirements. [IEEE-STD-610] * Software Verification: The process of evaluating software to determine whether the products of a given development phase satisfy the conditions imposed at the start of that phase. [IEEE- STD-610] Validation during the software development process can be seen as a form of User Requirements Specification validation; and, that at the end of the development process is equivalent to Internal and/or External Software validation. Verification, from CMMI's point of view, is evidently of the artifact kind. In other words, software verification ensures that the output of each phase of the software development process effectively carry out what its corresponding input artifact specifies (requirement -> design -> software product), while software validation ensures that the software product meets the needs of all the stakeholders (therefore, the requirement specification was correctly and accurately expressed in the first place). Software verification ensures that \\"you built it right\\" and confirms that the product, as provided, fulfills the plans of the developers. Software validation ensures that \\"you built the right thing\\" and confirms that the product, as provided, fulfills the intended use and goals of the stakeholders. This article has used the strict or narrow definition of verification. From a testing perspective: * Fault ‚Äì wrong or missing function in the code. * Failure ‚Äì the manifestation of a fault during execution. The software was not effective. It does not do \\"what\\" it is supposed to do. * Malfunction ‚Äì according to its specification the system does not meet its specified functionality. The software was not efficient (it took too many resources such as CPU cycles, it used too much memory, performed too many I/O operations, etc.), it was not usable, it was not reliable, etc. It does not do something \\"how\\" it is supposed to do it. Related concepts Both verification and validation are related to the concepts of quality and of software quality assurance. By themselves, verification and validation do not guarantee software quality; planning, traceability, configuration management and other aspects of software engineering are required. Within the modeling and simulation (M&S;) community, the definitions of verification, validation and accreditation are similar: * M&S; Verification is the process of determining that a computer model, simulation, or federation of models and simulations implementations and their associated data accurately represent the developer's conceptual description and specifications. * M&S; Validation is the process of determining the degree to which a model, simulation, or federation of models and simulations, and their associated data are accurate representations of the real world from the perspective of the intended use(s). * Accreditation is the formal certification that a model or simulation is acceptable to be used for a specific purpose. The definition of M&S; validation focuses on the accuracy with which the M&S; represents the real-world intended use(s). Determining the degree of M&S; accuracy is required because all M&S; are approximations of reality, and it is usually critical to determine if the degree of approximation is acceptable for the intended use(s). This stands in contrast to software validation. Classification of methods In mission-critical software systems, where flawless performance is absolutely necessary, formal methods may be used to ensure the correct operation of a system. These formal methods can prove costly, however, representing as much as 80 percent of total software design cost. Test cases A test case is a tool used in the process. Test cases may be prepared for software verification and software validation to determine if the product was built according to the requirements of the user. Other methods, such as reviews, may be used early in the life cycle to provide for software validation. Independent Verification and Validation ISVV stands for Independent Software Verification and Validation. ISVV is targeted at safety-critical software systems and aims to increase the quality of software products, thereby reducing risks and costs through the operational life of the software. ISVV provides assurance that software performs to the specified level of confidence and within its designed parameters and defined requirements. ISVV activities are performed by independent engineering teams, not involved in the software development process, to assess the processes and the resulting products. The ISVV team independency is performed at three different levels: financial, managerial and technical. ISVV goes far beyond ‚Äútraditional‚Äù verification and validation techniques, applied by development teams. While the latter aim to ensure that the software performs well against the nominal requirements, ISVV is focused on non-functional requirements such as robustness and reliability, and on conditions that can lead the software to fail. ISVV results and findings are fed back to the development teams for correction and improvement. ISVV History ISVV derives from the application of IV&V; (Independent Verification and Validation) to the software. Early ISVV application (as known today) dates back to the early 1970s when the U.S. Army sponsored the first significant program related to IV&V; for the Safeguard Anti-Ballistic Missile System. By the end of the 1970s IV&V; was rapidly becoming popular. The constant increase in complexity, size and importance of the software lead to an increasing demand on IV&V; applied to software (ISVV). Meanwhile, IV&V; (and ISVV for software systems) gets consolidated and is now widely used by organisations such as the DoD, FAA, NASANASA IV&V; Facility and ESA.ESA Web site IV&V; is mentioned in [DO-178B], [ISO/IEC 12207] and formalised in [IEEE 1012]. Initially in 2004-2005, a European consortium led by the European Space Agency, and composed by DNV(N),DNV Web site Critical Software SA(P),Critical Software SA Web site Terma(DK)Terma Web site and CODA Scisys(UK)Scisys Web site created the first version of a guide devoted to ISVV, called \\"ESA Guide for Independent Verification and Validation\\" with support from other organizations, e.g. SoftWcare SL (E) (SoftWcare SL Web site), etc. In 2008 the European Space Agency released a second version, being SoftWcare SL was the supporting editor having received inputs from many different European Space ISVV stakeholders. This guide covers the methodologies applicable to all the software engineering phases in what concerns ISVV. ISVV Methodology ISVV is usually composed by five principal phases, these phases can be executed sequentially or as results of a tailoring process. > ISVV Planning * Planning of ISVV Activities * System Criticality Analysis: > Identification of Critical Components through a set of RAMS activities > (Value for Money) * Selection of the appropriate Methods and Tools > Requirements Verification * Verification for: Completeness, Correctness, > Testability > Design Verification * Design adequacy and conformance to Software > Requirements and Interfaces * Internal and External Consistency * > Verification of Feasibility and Maintenance > Code Verification * Verification for: Completeness, Correctness, Consistency > * Code Metrics Analysis * Coding Standards Compliance Verification > Validation * Identification of unstable components/functionalities * > Validation focused on Error-Handling: complementary (not concurrent!) > validation regarding the one performed by the Development team (More for the > Money, More for the Time) * Compliance with Software and System Requirements > * Black box testing and White box testing techniques * Experience based > techniques Regulatory environment Verification and validation must meet the compliance requirements of law regulated industries, which is often guided by government agencies or industrial administrative authorities. For instance, the FDA requires software versions and patches to be validated.

R√∏mer then saw that the freezing point of pure water was roughly one eighth of the way (about 7.5 degrees) between these two points, so he redefined the lower fixed point to be the freezing point of water at precisely 7.5 degrees. This did not greatly change the scale but made it easier to calibrate by defining it by reference to pure water. Thus the unit of this scale, a R√∏mer degree, is 100/52.5 = 40/21 of a kelvin or Celsius degree. The symbol is sometimes given as ¬∞R, but since that is also sometimes used for the R√©aumur and Rankine scales, the other symbol ¬∞R√∏ is to be preferred.  Importance  The R√∏mer scale is no longer in use but is of some historical importance. Alongside the Newton scale, it was the first calibrated scale. Previous thermometers gave only an indication of whether the temperature was rising or falling, or else were highly inaccurate. For instance the top and bottom marks of thermometers were typically set to the hottest and coldest days, respectively, of the current year which clearly would vary from year to year.Don Rittner, A to Z of Scientists in Weather and Climate, page 53, Infobase Publishing, 2009, . The idea of using two fiduciary points with equally spaced calibration marks between them was completely new. R√∏mer was familiar with Galileo's thermoscope and understood that its large inaccuracies were due to it being affected by air pressure as well as temperature. He followed Ferdinand II of Tuscany's idea of enclosing a liquid in a sealed glass tube which made it immune to pressure changes. R√∏mer's thermometer was also an improvement in the fluid that he used. He used a mixture of alcohol and water, conveniently available in the form of wine. This avoided the drawbacks of both the low boiling point of pure alcohol and the extreme non-linearity of pure water near freezing.Jonathan Shectman, Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, and Discoveries of the 18th Century, pp. 248‚Äì49, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003 .Susan Wills, Steven R. Wills, Meteorology: Predicting the Weather, pp. 19-21, The Oliver Press, Inc., 2003 .  Relationship to other scales  Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit, inventor of the Fahrenheit scale, learned of R√∏mer's work and visited him in 1708. Fahrenheit described how he borrowed the idea for his scale from this visit, but increased the number of divisions.Roger W. Coltey, Survey of medical technology, University of Michigan, 1978, p. 29. Newton published his scale in the same year as R√∏mer. Newton's system was calibrated between the freezing point of water (0 degrees) and human body temperature (12 degrees); it was a coarser scale, but unlike R√∏mer's it was not intended for everyday use, as Newton's interest was in determining the boiling points of metals, which are not readily accessible with R√∏mer's system based on liquid thermometers.

While the technical feat of allowing four players to fight simultaneously in the same room was to be a major selling point, this was overshadowed by the controversy surrounding the game's depictions of violence and sexual content. Examples of this content include BDSM and fetishistic costumes and acts, limb dismemberment, and violent special moves with suggestive names such as \\"Bitch Slap\\" \\"Swallow This\\" and \\"Going Down\\". Thrill Kill notably received the rare \\"Adults Only\\" (AO) rating from the Entertainment Software Rating Board, and was the first game to receive such a rating for its violent content; all prior AO ratings had been for sexual content. Owing to this, Thrill Kill was ultimately not released; near-finished builds of the game, however, were later bootlegged and uploaded to the Internet. History Thrill Kill was developed in the late 1990s for the Sony PlayStation by Paradox Development, later Midway Studios - Los Angeles. There was much hype surrounding the game, billed as the new Mortal Kombat, and expectations were high in the gaming community. The publisher was to be Virgin Interactive, but in the summer of 1998 the North American operations of Virgin Interactive were acquired by Electronic Arts as part of their buyout of the developer Westwood Studios, whom Virgin Interactive also owned. This led to EA buying the publishing rights to the game. By this point Thrill Kill had already finished development in entirety. A few weeks before shipping, the game's release was scrapped by Electronic Arts because they didn't want to \\"publish such a senselessly violent game\\", as they felt that it would harm their image. They also stated that they deemed the game so offensive that they would not even attempt to sell the game nor to have it released by another publisher. Later, former employees that had worked on the game released the full game to the group T@STY who completed it before releasing it onto the internet along with various beta versions and bootlegs of the game. These flooded the market and were still seen by a large share of its original intended audience nevertheless. All files are still widely available through filesharing, and playable through emulators. Gameplay Gameplay consisted of a closed 3D room where up to four opponents would fight to the death, and proceed to finish each other off with Thrill Kills, much like the fatalities of Mortal Kombat. Every attack made would result in a character's bloodlust rising. Instead of the usual life bar, characters built up a \\"kill meter\\". Once this meter was full, and therefore bloodlust at its strongest, a player's character would be electrocuted to give them superhuman strength enabling a Thrill Kill move to brutally slay an opponent, depending on what button was pressed upon grabbing someone. Plot Ten damned souls have died and descended into Hell. This modern-day Hell is based on the real world of today's deviants. The characters are the physical manifestations of their mental illnesses or the evil hidden within their mortal selves. Each character has been a murderer, usually after their said illness/evil inner self. Marukka, the Goddess of Secrets, is bored of her usual routine and decides that it would be entertaining to pit all of the characters against one another in a fighting tournament with the prize being reincarnation. Each character is battling for nothing more than self-preservation and the hope of being reborn. Development and cancellation The controversy surrounding the game raised the interest of Thrill Kill in the gaming community greatly, helping bootleg copies of the game to become very common. In their September 2004 issue, Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine cited Thrill Kill as one of the most overrated cancelled games, stating \\"It got lots of hype. But it really sucked, too.\\"OPM staff (September 2004). \\"Overrated/Underrated\\" (SWF transcript ). Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine The Thrill Kill engine was later used in numerous other games. It was used to make Wu-Tang: Shaolin Style (released on October 31, 1999 by Activision), a game based on the rap group Wu-Tang Clan. The Thrill Kill engine was later used in two-player form for X-Men: Mutant Academy (released on July 11, 2000 by Activision), X-Men: Mutant Academy 2 (released on September 17, 2001 by Activision) and Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots Arena (released on November 30, 2000 by Mattel Interactive).Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots Arena: The fourth rendition of the Thrill Kill engine brings us a cool fighter -- new screens and videos, ign.com, 9 February 2000, updated 20 May 2012 In 2009, Game Informer ranked Thrill Kill tenth on a list of \\"The Top Ten Games That Almost Were\\".\\"The Top Ten Games that Almost Were\\", Game Informer 200 (): 18.

It is located along the eastern edge of the upper watershed of the Humboldt River, which flows to the southwest from its source just north of the range. The range reaches a maximum elevation of atop Hole in the Mountain Peak. Most of the range is included within the Ruby Mountains Ranger District of the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest. In 1989, the United States Congress passed the Nevada Wilderness Protection Act establishing over of the range as the East Humboldt Wilderness. The range takes its name from the Humboldt River. The name ultimately is derived from the German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt. The East Humboldts run north-to-south for approximately . To the north are Interstate 80 and the community of Wells, while to the south are Secret Pass, the larger Ruby Range, and Ruby Valley. To the east are Clover Valley and U.S. Route 93, and to the west are Starr Valley and Dennis Flats. These mountains were formed by a tilted fault-block process, with gradual slopes and valleys to the west and a steep escarpment to the east. Both sides of the range show extensive evidence of glaciation during recent ice ages, including U-shaped canyons, moraines, and steeply carved granite mountains, cliffs, and cirques. All of these features can be seen from the paved road from Wells to scenic Angel Lake. The range begins with a dramatic rise from a point near the source of the Humboldt River and the community of Wells, at an elevation of , to the summit of Greys Peak at . From there, the range continues south for nearly as a high crest, staying mostly above . The center section of this crest includes the range high point, Hole in the Mountain Peak. The southernmost high summit of the range is Humboldt Peak (), after which the main crest begins a gradual descent, forming the northeastern slopes of Secret Pass and the eastern side of North Ruby Valley. The range includes many glacial tarns, including Angel Lake, Smith Lake, Greys Lake, and Winchell Lake to the north, and Lizzie's Basin, Boulder Lakes, and Steele Lake in the central section. Hiking trails run from Secret Pass up the western side of the range all the way around to Angel Lake, from Angel Lake to nearby Smith Lake, and from a trailhead near Angel Lake down the east side of the range to Winchell Lake and Lizzie's Basin. Public access is principally found at Angel Lake, a trailhead at the west end of Secret Pass, and via a primitive road at Weeks Canyon/Lizzie's Basin.

The techniques attempt to detect, and thus prevent, certain kinds of defects (bugs) by examining the structure of the code being produced at its syntactic rather than semantic level. Usage Syntactic methods are often used when formal methods are not an option, and are often a simpler and, more importantly, cheaper alternative. In non-mission-critical systems, formal methods may prove to be too expensive for the benefit they provide. The costs of modelling, personnel, execution and development may often outweigh the benefits gained by preventing possible failures. This approach revolves around the use of an abstract dependency graph which is created from the system in question. An abstract dependency graph is a directed graph, a graph of vertices connected by one-way edges. Most often, the vertices and edges of the graph represent the inputs and outputs of functions in or components of the system. By inspecting the created abstract dependency graph, the developer can detect syntactic anomalies (or Preece anomalies) in the system. While anomalies are not always defects, they often provide clues to finding defects in a system. Therefore, the anomalies in a system help point the developer in the right direction in finding defects. Anomalies There are four main types of anomaly: * Redundancies - A chunk of the graph is redundant if its terminals can be reached if the chunk is removed from the graph * Conflicts - A system contains conflicts if the same inputs can imply different outputs * Circularities - A loop in the graph indicates a circularity in the system * Deficiencies - A chunk is deficient if a subset of inputs leads to no terminals While anomalies often point to defects, they can just as easily reflect normal intended functionality in the system. It is up to the developer to look into anomalies in order to determine whether they are clues to problems or simply false alarms. By creating a visual directed graph of a system, there are several obvious visual flags that indicate the above anomalies: * a sub-graph with no input is probably missing something important; * while looking at the transitive closure of a system (all nodes downstream from a node), a node in its own transitive closure indicates a circularity; * while looking at the transitive closure of a system, subsumption between pairs of rows indicates redundancy; * conflicts are somewhat more difficult as they become more semantic than syntactic. When formal methods prove too costly, a system can be checked solely on its syntax. This is not as thorough, as it only looks at a system on a surface level. However, it does give a developer many clues as to where a system's defects may lie. General references *\\"Syntactic theory of software architecture.\\" Dean, Thomas R., Cordy, James R.

Fearnley-Whittingstall hosted the River Cottage series on the UK television channel Channel 4, in which audiences observe his efforts to become a self-reliant, downshifted farmer in rural England; Fearnley-Whittingstall feeds himself, his family and friends with locally produced and sourced fruits, vegetables, fish, eggs, and meat. He has also become a campaigner on issues related to food production and the environment, such as fisheries management and animal welfare. Fearnley- Whittingstall established River Cottage HQ in Dorset in 2004, and the operation is now based at Park Farm near Axminster in Devon. An organic smallholding, HQ is also the hub for a broad range of courses and events, and home to the River Cottage Cookery School. Fearnley-Whittingstall continues to teach and host events there on a regular basis. He also oversees the menu and sourcing in the River Cottage Kitchens ‚Äì restaurants in Axminster, Bristol, and Winchester.  Early life  Fearnley-Whittingstall was born in Hampstead, London, to Robert Fearnley-Whittingstall, of a landed gentry family formerly of Watford and Hawkswick, Hertfordshire, and gardener and writer Jane Margaret, daughter of Colonel John Hawdon Lascelles, of the King's Royal Rifle Corps, OBE.Burke's Landed Gentry, 18th edition, vol. 2, ed. Peter Townend, 1969, Fearnley-Whittingstall formerly of Watford and Hawkswick pedigreehttps://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/37761/supplement/5137/data.pdf He was brought up in Gloucestershire. He was educated at Summer Fields School, Eton College, and St Peter's College, Oxford, where he read philosophy and psychology. Early career After a temporary relocation to Africa, where Fearnley-Whittingstall was considering a career in wildlife conservation, he returned to England and became a sous chef at the River Caf√© in London. He has since said that \\"being messy\\" and \\"lacking discipline\\", though, made him unsuitable for working in the River Caf√© kitchen, but that he regards his time there as a period that helped shape his current career. Following his time at the River Caf√©, Fearnley-Whittingstall commenced freelance journalism and was published in Punch, the Evening Standard, and The Sunday Times.  Television   Early shows  Fearnley-Whittingstall's initial television exposure was on Cook on the Wild Side, an exploration of earthy cuisine. His next series was TV Dinners, in which he flamb√©ed and pur√©ed a human placenta to then serve as p√¢t√© during one episode. In 2002, he presented the six-episode series, Treats from the Edwardian Country House.  River Cottage  In 1997, Fearnley-Whittingstall moved into River Cottage, a former game-keeper's lodge in the grounds of Slape Manor in Netherbury, Dorset, UK, which he had previously used as a weekend and holiday home. The lodge became the setting for three Channel 4 series: Escape to River Cottage, Return to River Cottage, and River Cottage Forever, all directed by Garry John Hughes. He has become an ardent supporter of the organic movement. In 2004, Beyond River Cottage followed Fearnley-Whittingstall's progress as he set up a new business, River Cottage H.Q., on a property close to Dottery (near Bridport), Dorset, with his family. Underpinning his new enterprise is the selling of the produce cultivated on his property at the local marketplace, and audiences bear witness to the host's experiences as a produce seller, while also intermittently receiving the recipe lessons traditionally seen on food shows. The series concludes with a Christmas special in which a feast is brought together, consisting of a 10-bird roast using Fearnley-Whittingstall's own geese and ducks. In 2005, a series called The View from River Cottage was produced using extracts from the four previous series, accompanied by newly recorded narration. This was followed by River Cottage Road Trip special that consisted of two newly produced one-hour instalments. During 2006, Fearnley- Whittingstall moved River Cottage HQ from the original barn near Bridport to its new premises, Park Farm, a farm near Uplyme on the West Dorset/East Devon border.rivercottage.net September newsletter. A new series called The River Cottage Treatment was filmed there and was broadcast on Channel 4 in November 2006.rivercottage.net October newsletter. This premise of this series involved guests described as \\"urban-dwellers, fast-food lovers, and convenient food- mongers\\" to spend a week with the host on the new property, the guests being required to undertake farm duties and to eat according to the River Cottage philosophy. In 2007, Fearnley-Whittingstall presented, River Cottage: Gone Fishing, a short series that is the concept's 10th overall, in which he examines some of the lesser-known fish to be caught around the British Isles. From 2008, he filmed magazine-style food programmes, produced at River Cottage HQ, based on the seasonal themes. River Cottage Spring ran from 28 May 2008 to 25 June 2008 on Channel 4, and in one of the episodes, Fearnley-Whittingstall demonstrated his \\"holistic\\" approach to cooking by slaughtering, preparing, and cooking the entirety of a lamb. In late 2008, River Cottage Autumn was broadcast from 16 October to 6 November 2008. In one of the autumnal episodes, Fearnley-Whittingstall, together with his friend, John, embarks on a mission to catch crustaceans at a nearby beach with the use of pots. The pair seek to catch prawns, crabs and lobsters, in addition to the blue velvet swimming crab that is commonly found at the particular coastal location where they are based. On 19 October 2009, a new series of four episodes aired on Channel 4: River Cottage ‚Äì Winter's on the Way. In one of the episodes from the winter series, Fearnley-Whittingstall captures, prepares, and cooks rabbits that he finds on his property and introduces viewers to salsify; according to the host, salsify was popular during the Victorian era.  New River Cottage  In September 2010, a new series of River Cottage episodes, entitled River Cottage Every Day, commenced. The series encouraged viewers to cook from scratch more frequently and was accompanied by a book of the same name. In autumn 2011, a new series, River Cottage: Veg Every Day, was launched and is based on Fearnley-Whittingstall's developed awareness regarding the problematic way in which meat is produced and consumed in the modern era. During the series, the food activist addresses the challenge that he defines in the series' first episode: \\"A whole summer without flesh\\". Fearnley- Whittingstall explains further: \\"In the weeks ahead, I'll be expanding my vegetable horizons, seeking out new flavours and textures, and cooking up a whole raft of vegetable dishes with the same excitement and gusto that I've always bestowed on meat and fish.\\" A new series of River Cottage, entitled Hugh's Three Good Things, aired on Channel 4 in December 2012. Accompanied by a cookbook, the series was based on the notion that a great meal can be prepared from gathering three good ingredients; in the first episode, Fearnley-Whittingstall uses beetroot, egg, and anchovies to make an open sandwich. He also competed against guest chefs in each episode and viewers were invited to challenge the television host with a superior recipe. New series In August 2015, alongside Lindsey Chapman, he hosted a series of five daily programmes on BBC One, linked to three evening programmes Big Blue Live. The series concentrated on marine wildlife around the UK coast. In November 2015, Fearnley-Whittingstall presented Hugh's War on Waste on BBC One, campaigning against waste by food producers, retailers, and consumers. In 2018, he filmed Britain's Fat Fight with Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, a documentary for BBC One, where he explored the obesity crisis in Britain, asking food producers, restaurants, and the government to confront the crisis. Fearnley-Whittingstall's letter to the government was signed by 97,869 people; the government responded, and on 25 June, launched a new childhood obesity strategy. Also in the programme, Fearnley-Whittingstall, in partnership with Newcastle City Council, launched Newcastle Can (newcastlecan.com), an initiative and experiment aimed to encourage the citizens of Newcastle to work together to get healthier and fitter. Guest appearances Hugh Fearnly- Whittingstall appeared on Celebrity Countdown in 1998; he was named by former host Richard Whiteley as the de facto champion with the highest score of the series. He then appeared on the first series of Channel 4's The F Word in 2005, advising Gordon Ramsay on the rearing of turkeys at Ramsay's London home; the turkeys are eaten in the last episode of the series. Further appearances on The F-Word in 2006 and 2007 involved Fearnley-Whittingstall advising Ramsay on the rearing of pigs and lambs; again, the consumption of the livestock occurs in the last episodes of the series. At the start of 2008, Fearnley-Whittingstall ‚Äì along with fellow celebrity chefs Jamie Oliver and Ramsay ‚Äì was featured in Channel 4's Big Food Fight season; his contribution to the season was Hugh's Chicken Run, which was shown over three consecutive nights. He created three chicken farms in Axminster (one intensive, one commercial free-range, and the third a community farm project staffed by volunteers), culminating in a \\"Chicken Out!\\" campaign to encourage the eating of free-range chicken. In 2008, based on the success of the project, further discussion occurred among Channel 4 executives regarding the filming of another season. In 2009, Fearnley-Whittingstall became a permanent team captain, opposing a different guest captain each week, on a food-based panel game, The Big Food Fight, which began on Channel 4 on 8 September; this is not to be confused with the earlier project of the same name. On 12 June, he was a guest on BBC One's Have I Got News For You and he recorded a guest spot on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs that was broadcast on 26 July and again on 31 July 2009. In 2010, Fearnley-Whittingstall made an appearance on the BBC One comedy panel show, Would I Lie to You?, with host Rob Brydon, who awarded him the \\"Liar of the Week\\" prize. Fearnley-Whittingstall also appeared on BBC Two's satirical music panel show, Never Mind the Buzzcocks, on an episode recorded in 2008; airing was delayed until 19 January 2011, due to the scandals surrounding Russell Brand that led to his resignation from the BBC. Writing Fearnley-Whittingstall published Cuisine Bon March√© in 1994. He wrote the cookbooks, The River Cottage Year, The River Cottage Fish Book (with Nick Fisher), The River Cottage Cookbook (winner of the Andre Simon Food Book of the Year award, the Guild of Food Writers‚Äô Michael Smith Award, and the Glenfiddich Trophy and Food Book of the Year), and The River Cottage Meat Book (the last two books with photographs by Simon Wheeler). His most recent book, published on 29 March 2011, is River Cottage Every Day. He has written articles for The Guardian and The Observer since 2001. A collection of his short articles was published in October 2006 under the title Hugh Fearlessly Eats It All: Dispatches from the Gastronomic Frontline. He edited The Big Bento Box of Unuseless Japanese Inventions, written by Kenji Kawakami. Activism In January 2008, Fearnley-Whittingstall called on hospitality and food-service operators to use less intensively farmed chicken: > It's one thing to challenge individual consumers to give up intensively > reared chicken, but it's also an issue where anyone in the business of > selling chicken has to take a stand... in some cases I know chefs, not > naming names, at the very high-end sector who are not using free-range > birds. Some of them are on the road to Michelin stars. In 2012, Fearnley-Whittingstall filmed a Channel 4 series, Hugh's Fish Fight. The series was broadcast in three parts on Channel 4. The campaign's website said it had received over 700,000 signatures by 2012. In November 2015, he filmed Hugh's War on Waste. with the BBC and began a campaign to reduce consumer waste in the UK. The two programmes focused on food and clothing waste, both by supermarkets and by shoppers in their own homes. In 2018, he filmed Britain's Fat Fight with Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, where he explored the obesity crisis in Britain, asking food producers, restaurants and the government to confront the crisis.  Other projects  Fearnley-Whittingstall helped develop Stinger, a nettle-flavoured ale, with the Hall & Woodhouse brewery. Another Fearnley-Whittingstall project was the conversion of an old inn in Axminster to an organic produce shop and canteen, which opened in September 2007. In 2009, he became a patron of ChildHope UK, an international child-protection charity working in Africa, Asia, and South America. In 2009, The River Cottage Summer's Here programme promoted the Landshare project that seeks to bring together people who wish to grow fruit and vegetables, but have no land, with landowners willing to donate spare land for cultivation. The online project was commissioned by Channel 4.  Personal life  Hugh married Marie Derome in 2001; the couple live in East Devon with their four children. Fearnley-Whittingstall also runs the River Cottage Canteen and Deli in the centre of Axminster and, in 2011, launched a second River Cottage Canteen and Deli in Plymouth (since closed) and a third in Winchester.

Its former name (before 1990) was the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada (UGOCC). The Church, currently a metropolis of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, is part of the wider Eastern Orthodox communion, however was created independently in 1918. It has cathedrals in many Canadian cities including Winnipeg, Saskatoon, Vancouver, Edmonton, Toronto, and Montreal. The Metropolitan Cathedral, seminary (St. Andrew's College), and central administrative office are all based in Winnipeg. Also the church is affiliated with four residences for university students: St. Vladimir Institute in Toronto, Ontario; St. Petro Mohyla Institute in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan; St. John's Institute in Edmonton, Alberta; and one operating at St. Andrew's College. The church's membership is about ten thousand. The current Primate of the church is Metropolitan Yurij (Kalistchuk). History  Most ethnic Ukrainians moving to Canada from Galicia (Western Ukraine) in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were Greek Catholics, and were tended early on by the local Roman Catholic hierarchy until the creation of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Exarchate in 1912. This was because the North American Roman Catholic bishops believed that the presence of married Eastern Catholic priests would create a scandal at the time. The other major group of Ukrainians which were coming to Canada were from Bukovina, and they were mostly Orthodox. At first these Orthodox Christians were served by the Russian Orthodox Mission in North America (which at that time was part of the Russian Orthodox Church), but these services were not conducted in their native Ukrainian language. Catholics and the Orthodox who wanted to establish their own church met in the summer of 1918 in the city of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan and established the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church in Canada. Also at these meetings, the delegates (mostly from Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba) had established a Brotherhood to try to help the young church. The settlers had just created a new church, but they were very conscious of Church Canon Law that states that a church cannot exist without a bishop. The church's brotherhood tried to have Archbishop Alexander of the Russian Orthodox Mission to take the church under his temporary care as bishop. At first Archbishop Alexander agreed, but later declined; however, the UGOC's First Sobor (Church Council) still took place as planned on December 28, 1918 in Saskatoon. This Sobor led to the establishment of the church's first seminary in Saskatoon. The Brotherhood still searched for a temporary bishop, and eventually found one: Metropolitan Germanos (Shehadi), who was the Metropolitan of the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America. He led the church for the next 5 years (1919-1924). Under his supervision, Sobor II took place in Saskatoon on November 27, 1919.  Archbishop John (Theodorovich)  Following Metropolitan Germanos' leadership, Archbishop John (Theodorovich) became the church's orimate. Archbishop John had just arrived in the United States from the non-canonical Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, and he began to serve the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA to become their Primate and Metropolitan. The young church had chosen the Ukrainian bishop as their bishop, hoping that the church would further grow under his leadership. During the summers from 1924 to 1946 Archbishop John would make an annual trip to Canada to visit the parishes throughout the country. When Archbishop John was in the USA during the winter months, a Fr. Semen Sawchuk would act as an administrator at the Consistory in Canada. After a few years as acting Primate of the UOCC, certain controversies laid around Archbishop John, due to his uncanonical ordination to bishop. rchbishop John was \\"ordained\\" by the \\"bishops\\" of Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, who were not ordained according to the canon laws and traditions of the Orthodox Church, but were ordained by priests and lay people. The 1st Canon of the Holy Apostles states that new bishops should be ordained by at least 2 or 3 bishops. As a result of this, Archbishop John resigned his position as ruling bishop in 1946. At a special Sobor in 1947, Bishop Mstyslav (Skrypnyk) was accepted as the new Archbishop of Winnipeg and all Canada. However, due to some misunderstandings, and arguments about how the church should be governed (mostly between himself and Semen Sawchuk), he resigned as Primate in 1950 at X Sobor in Winnipeg, Manitoba. In response the UOCC contacted Metropolitan Polycarp (Sikorski) (who was the head of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church Abroad, composed of refugee bishops formerly affiliated with the Polish Orthodox Church in German-occupied Ukraine) for assistance, and he agreed to send some bishops over to help the faithful in Canada. Formation of the Metropolia At a special sobor in 1947 the UGOCC accepted Bishop Mstyslav (Skrypnyk) of Pereyaslav of the UAOC, consecrated during World War II with the blessing of Metropolitan Dionysius (Waledy≈Ñski) of Warsaw, as its ruling bishop with the title \\"Archbishop of Winnipeg and All Canada\\".http://www.uocc.ca/en- ca/about/history/ Due to conflicts between Archbishop Mstyslav and members of the UGOCC Consistory, however, the former resigned as diocesan bishop at the tenth sobor of the Church in 1950, once again leaving the UGOCC without a bishop. After the resignation of Archbishop Mstyslav the Consistory appealed to Metropolitan Polycarp of the UAOC for assistance in finding bishops for the UGOCC. By the time another special sobor was called in 1951 four potential bishops, all consecrated in German-occupied Ukraine during World War II, had been found. One, Metropolitan Hilarion (Ohienko) of Kholm, had been resident in Winnipeg since 1947. Two others, Archbishop Michael (Khoroshy) and Bishop Platon (Artemiuk), came to Canada at the invitation of the Consistory and with the blessing of Metropolitan Polycarp. At the 1951 sobor it was decided that the UGOCC, which had grown to include some 300 parishes, would be organized as a metropolia. Metropolitan Ilarion was elected Metropolitan of Winnipeg and All Canada and primate of the UGOCC, while Archbishop Michael was elected Archbishop of Toronto and Eastern Canada. (Bishop Platon had died shortly after his arrival in Canada.) The size of the UGOCC necessitated the appointment of more bishops, and so in 1959 Archimandrite Andrew (Metiuk) was elected Bishop of Edmonton and Western Canada and in 1963 Archimandrite Boris (Yakovkevych) was elected Bishop of Saskatoon and auxiliary or assistant bishop of the Central Eparchy under Metropolitan Ilarion. After 21 years as primate of the UGOCC, Metropolitan Ilarion died on March 29, 1972, and was succeeded by Archbishop Michael of Toronto as Metropolitan of Winnipeg and All Canada. After Metropolitan Michael‚Äôs retirement in 1975 Archbishop Andrew (Metiuk) was elected metropolitan, serving until his death on February 2, 1985. Under Metropolitan Andrew new bishops, Bishops Mikolaj (Debryn), Basil (Fedak), and John (Stinka), were elected to serve the UGOCC, and after Metropolitan Andrew‚Äôs death Bishop Wasyly was elected Metropolitan of Winnipeg and All Canada. Four years after his enthronement as primate of the UGOCC Metropolitan Wasyly consecrated Archimandrite Yurij (Kalistchuk) as Bishop of Saskatoon. Recent history After dialoguing with the Church of Constantinople the UGOCC was received into its jurisdiction as the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada in 1990, bringing it into the full communion of the canonical Orthodox Church. (Several years later its sister church, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Diaspora, also joined the Patriarchate of Constantinople.) The decree of Ecumenical Patriarch Demetrius (Papadopoulos) uniting the UOCC with the Church of Constantinople recognized the Church‚Äôs internal autonomy under its metropolitan, justifying the reception of the UOCC into the Patriarchate‚Äôs jurisdiction on the basis of the historic jurisdiction of the Church of Constantinople in Ukraine. Following the death of Metropolitan Wasyly in early 2005 the twenty-first sobor of the UOCC elected Archbishop John as Metropolitan of Winnipeg and Canada. In August 2008 an extraordinary sobor was held in Saskatoon to elect new bishops, amend the UOCC‚Äôs bylaws, and mark the 90th anniversary of the founding of the UOCC in the city. The sobor elected Bishops Ilarion (Rudnyk) of Telmessos as Bishop of Edmonton and Andriy (Peshko) of Krateia as auxiliary Bishop of Saskatoon. In July 2010 another special sobor of the UOCC was held to nominate a successor to the newly retired Metropolitan John. The sobor nominated Archbishop Yurij (Kalistchuk) of Toronto for the metropolitanate, and consequently on August 30, 2010, the Holy Synod in Constantinople elected Archbishop Yurij as Archbishop of Winnipeg and Metropolitan of Canada. Structure The UOCC is divided into three eparchies or dioceses, the Eastern Eparchy, with its cathedral in Toronto, Ontario; the Central Eparchy, with its cathedral in Winnipeg, Manitoba; and the Western Eparchy, with its cathedral in Edmonton, Alberta. According to the custom of the UOCC the Church's primate is the titled the \\"Archbishop of Winnipeg and Metropolitan of Canada\\" and serves as the diocesan or ruling bishop of the Central Eparchy. The Eastern Eparchy currently does not have a ruling bishop, but is administered by Bishop Andriy (Peshko) of Krateia. The Western Eparchy is led by Bishop Ilarion (Rudnyk) of Edmonton and Western Canada. All of the UOCC's dioceses may have auxiliary bishops (titled 'Bishop of Vancouver' in the Western Eparchy, 'Bishop of Saskatoon' in the Central Eparchy and 'Bishop of Montreal' in the Eastern Eparchy), but none of the Eparchies have an auxiliary bishop at this time.

The MGM Grand is the largest single hotel in the United States with 6,852 rooms. It is also the third-largest hotel complex in the world by number of rooms and second-largest hotel resort complex in the United States behind the combined The Venetian and The Palazzo. When it opened in 1993, the MGM Grand was the largest hotel complex in the world. Owned by MGM Growth Properties and The Blackstone Group and operated by MGM Resorts International, the 30-floor main building is high. The property includes five outdoor pools, rivers, and waterfalls that cover , a convention center, the MGM Grand Garden Arena, and the Grand Spa. It also houses numerous shops, night clubs, restaurants and the largest casino in Clark County, which occupies .

Instead, the MGM Grand is linked by overhead pedestrian bridges to its neighboring casinos: to the south across Tropicana Avenue, the Tropicana, and to the west across the Strip, New York-New York. History Marina Hotel and Casino (1975‚Äì1990) The property was originally the site of the Golf Club Motel during the 1960s. In 1972, Tom Wiesner co-founded Southwest Securities Development Company, and later founded Wiesner Investment Company. In November 1973, Southwest Securities Development was planning the Airport Marina Hotel, to be built at the site of the 170-room Golf Club Motel, which was located near McCarran International Airport. Southwest planned to renovate the motel structure and add a 14-story addition with 518 rooms. Fred Harvey Company would serve as the operator of the hotel, its restaurants, and other areas of the resort. Fred Harvey had previously opened hotels in other parts of the United States under the Airport Marina name. Southwest also planned to construct a casino that would operate separately from Fred Harvey. The 700-room Marina, located at 3805 South Las Vegas Boulevard, was built by Wiesner Investment Company and was opened in 1975. In 1989, Wiesner and his partners sold the Marina to Kirk Kerkorian, who also bought the Tropicana Country Club, located behind the Marina and across Tropicana Avenue from the Tropicana and San R√©mo hotels to obtain the site that would become the home of the MGM Grand. Kerkorian saw the Marina as a stable and solidly built resort, and decided not to destroy the hotel, but to build around it.http://www.lasvegasmikey.com/marina.htm During that time, the Marina was known as the MGM-Marina Hotel. The Marina closed on November 30, 1990, and ground was broken for the new casino hotel complex on October 7, 1991. The Marina hotel building still exists as the west wing of the main hotel building. MGM Grand (1993‚Äìpresent) When the latest MGM Grand opened on December 18, 1993, it was owned by MGM Grand Inc. At that time it had an extensive Wizard of Oz theme, including the green \\"Emerald City\\" color of the building and the decorative use of Wizard of Oz memorabilia. After entering the casino's main entrance, one would find themselves in the Oz Casino facing Emerald City. Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion were seen in front of the city. The Emerald City attraction featured an elaborate yellow brick road walk-through, complete with the cornfield, apple orchard, and haunted forest, as well as audio-animatronic figures of Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, and the Wicked Witch of the West. It would end at the door of the city, leading inside for a performance of \\"The Wizard's Secrets\\". When MGM Grand began its extensive refurbishment in 1996, the Oz Casino was the first to go. The Emerald City was completely demolished, and the Emerald City Gift Shop was moved to a new shopping section of the casino. The store remained open until early 2003. When the MGM Grand opened, the intention was to create a destination hotel in the Las Vegas area by including the MGM Grand Adventures Theme Park behind the casino. The plan was to make the Las Vegas Strip more family friendly by providing activities for those too young to linger inside the casino. The theme park performed poorly and did not reopen for the 2001 season. The site was redeveloped as a luxury condominium and hotel complex called The Signature at MGM Grand, opened in 2006. The resort's original entrance consisted of a giant lion head, made of fiberglass and blocky in appearance, with visitors entering through the lion's mouth. The lion was a cartoon-like version of MGM's logo, Leo the Lion. The MGM Grand performed unusually poorly with Asian gamblers in its first years of existence; a study by the management found that many Chinese patrons found it bad luck to walk through the jaws of a lion and avoided the hotel as a result, part of why the entrance was renovated to remove this feature.Las Vegas Adapts to Reap Chinese New Year BountyLas Vegas MGM Grand Hotel and Casino losing trademark 'live' lions The Las Vegas Monorail was built to connect MGM Grand to the Bally's hotel-casino in 1995. The coming-out party for the monorail, on behalf of Bally's, consisted of showgirls and guys from Bally's famed show, Jubilee!, helping groups to the monorail. Characters from The Wizard of Oz greeted the groups on the MGM side. The track was later updated to become the southernmost section of the Las Vegas Monorail. The MGM Grand station was refurbished, the trains were replaced with Bombardier M-VI's, and the track was extended beyond the southern station to provide for track switching for the trains, as well as a starting point for a potential future southern extension to the monorail line. MGM Grand 1994 In May 1996, MGM Grand Inc. announced a 30-month, four-phase renovation of the resort that would cost more than $250 million. The project would include replacing the property's lion entrance with a six-story gold lion structure. The first phase was to begin in June 1996, and would focus on the resort's restaurant, food court and arcade area, with the addition of several new restaurants. The second phase would include the $15 million reconstruction of the lion entrance. Other changes would include a convention center, to be built at a cost of $60 million; a $60 million retail and entertainment complex, including theme restaurants and nightclubs, to be built adjacent to the theme park; a new entrance, to be built along Koval Lane at a cost of $5 million, scheduled to begin in mid-1997; a $30 million renovation of 52 suites on the penthouse level; and $11 million to upgrade parts of the casino. The final phase would incorporate a $17 million entertainment theme at the resort's vehicle entrance on Tropicana Avenue. Other changes would include a $15 million renovation of the resort's Emerald City entertainment area, and an additional 2,000 parking spaces to be added at a cost of $13 million, for a new total of 11,000 spaces. Terrence Lanni, the chairman of MGM Grand Inc., said he wanted customers to \\"feel like guests coming to a premiere of one of the world's greatest movies. When we're completed, every aspect of this property will bespeak entertainment.\\" The former restaurant, retail and arcade area was redesigned into the Studio Walk, an area resembling a Hollywood sound stage and featuring various restaurants and shops. A statue of Leo, the MGM lion Demolition of the lion entrance began on May 13, 1997, and was expected to take two weeks, while the $250 million renovation project was expected to be finished by late 1998. The new facade was expected to cost $40 million to construct. In November 1997, the property installed 18 promotional and entertainment LED screens, including 15 outside the resort. Installation of the lion statue was underway in December 1997, with the addition of a 5,000-pound paw. Assembly of the 100,000-pound statue was expected to be finished later that month. The statue weighs 50 tons, and at tall, on a 25-foot pedestal, is the largest bronze statue in the U.S. The new facade also included 11 statues of winged Atlas- like men holding 16-foot diameter bowls. The statues were made of bronze- finished fiberglass and accompanied the lion statue, along with LED screens and water fountains. Work on the statue and accompanying fountains was expected to be finished in February 1998. The resort's conference center opened in April 1998. The conference center, a pool, and a spa were constructed on 15 acres of land previously occupied by a portion of the theme park and a parking lot. MGM Grand, with sign promoting it as The City of Entertainment, now removed In 2000, in an attempt to appeal to a more \\"mature\\" clientele, the hotel underwent a major renovation, and almost all traces of the Oz theme were removed. The theme is now more of the Art Deco era of classic Hollywood, and the hotel started billing itself as The City of Entertainment. More recently, the resort has used the phrase \\"Maximum Vegas\\", referring to the vast amount of activities MGM Grand offers its guests. On April 26, 2000, MGM opened a new satellite registration/hotel check-in center at McCarran International Airport. This was the first of its kind opened by a hotel company at any United States airport.Airport Check-In mgmgrand.com. However, this airport check-in center appears to have closed in late 2013. In 2005, MGM opened the West Wing, a renovation of the original Marina Hotel rooms. In October 2011, MGM began a renovation in which all of its rooms and suites in the main tower were fully renovated, along with the casino floor and other public areas. This has provided the hotel with a more contemporary room design. The work was completed in September 2012. In June 2017, MGM Resorts International held a groundbreaking for a expansion of the resort's convention conference center, for a total of upon completion. The expanded conference center was topped off in January 2018, and was opened in January 2019. It was built at a cost of $130 million. At the time, the hotel had a 90 percent occupancy rate. That month, plans were announced by MGM Resorts to eventually redevelop the resort's entrance on Las Vegas Boulevard to provide easier pedestrian access. The redeveloped area would include restaurants and retail space accessible to pedestrians, but was not expected to begin construction during 2019. MGM Resorts also planned to eventually redevelop the hotel's entrance on Tropicana Avenue in the years to come. In January 2020, MGM Resorts announced that it would sell the resort to a joint venture consisting of MGM Growth Properties and The Blackstone Group. MGM would own 50.1 percent of the joint venture, and Blackstone would own the remainder. The MGM Grand would be leased to MGM Resorts, which would continue to operate the resort. The deal was finalized a month later.

The MGM Grand is very well known to be the prior location of rapper Tupac Shakur before his assassination. He was reported to be watching the Bruce Seldon vs. Mike Tyson boxing match with his collective members including Suge Knight. Attractions The Lion Habitat in the MGM Grand *MGM Grand featured a glass-sided lion habitat inside the casino area, in which up to six lions were shown daily since 1999. A see-through tunnel ran through the habitat for close-up viewing, where the lions would frequently lounge on top of the glass, allowing visitors to walk under them. The lions were owned by Keith Evans, a trainer of exotic animals, and did not live at the habitat, but at his ranch outside Las Vegas. The lion habitat closed permanently in February 2012 as part of MGM Grand's renovation. *CSI: The Experience opened in the Studio Walk in September 2009. Here, guests try to solve one of three murder cases interactively, guided by touchscreen stations, cast member videos, and realistic recreated evidence. The first stop is a debriefing room where Gil Grissom introduces the \\"new recruits\\" to their assigned cases. After observing the evidence at the crime scene, visitors go to lab areas where they analyze the gathered evidence. They then present their findings in Grissom's office, answering a test based on their analysis of the evidence. Finally, visitors receive a case summary and a CSI diploma. * TopGolf: Built on the former site of MGM Grand Adventures theme park, opened in May 2016.

It is owned and operated by MGM Resorts International. Description New York-New York located on the Las Vegas Strip across from the MGM Grand Rear view at nightNew York-New York Hotel & Casino is located at 3790 Las Vegas Boulevard South, in Paradise, Nevada.View in midday It uses the New York City influence of its name in several ways. Its architecture is meant to evoke the New York City skyline of the 1940s era; the hotel includes several towers configured to resemble New York City buildings such as the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. Despite this claim, the hotel's facade also has some replicas of buildings that were built after the 1940s decade, like Lever House, Seagram Building, and the CBS Building. In front of the property is a 150-foot tall replica of the Statue of Liberty, and replicas of the Soldiers and Sailors Monument, the Brooklyn Bridge, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Main Immigration Building on Ellis Island, and Grand Central Terminal. Within the resort, particular gambling areas, lounges, restaurants, and meeting rooms are named after New York City neighborhoods or landmarks. The main casino area, for example, is named after Times Square, while the eateries are modeled after Greenwich Village. At the casino, special decks of playing cards are used where the \\"heart\\" suit is replaced by apples, in reference to the city's nickname Big Apple. The resort is located on the northwest corner of the Tropicana ‚Äì Las Vegas Boulevard intersection. At street level, pedestrians are blocked from crossing by concrete barriers. Instead, it is linked by overhead pedestrian bridges to its neighboring casinos to the south (the Excalibur, across Tropicana Avenue) and to the east (the MGM Grand). History The 18-acre site at the northwest corner of the Tropicana ‚Äì Las Vegas Boulevard intersection had been considered a prime spot for development due to its proximity to the MGM Grand, Excalibur, and Tropicana. Japanese firm Universal Distributing owned the property, and had discussed a joint venture with the Promus Companies to build a hotel-casino, but could not reach an agreement. In 1992, Kirk Kerkorian's Tracinda Corporation bought the site for $31.5 million and offered MGM Grand Inc., of which Kerkorian owned 76%, a free two-year option to buy it. The idea of a casino modeled after the New York skyline was conceived by Sig Rogich (a former White House staffer and United States Ambassador to Iceland) and Mark Advent. Rogich brought the idea to his friend, Gary Primm, head of Primadonna Resorts. Primm approached MGM president Bob Maxey in 1994 with the idea for MGM's prime Strip location, and a joint venture was formed between the two companies. Construction began in March 1995. Completed at a cost of $460 million, New York-New York opened on January 3, 1997. Since the initiation of New York-New York, analysts had speculated that MGM Grand or Primadonna would buy out the other's interest in the project. Instead of making such a cash-intensive purchase, however, MGM agreed to buy Primadonna outright for $276 million in stock plus $336 million in assumed debt. The merger closed in March 1999, giving MGM full control of New York-New York. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, people spontaneously sent various tributes to New York-New York, especially T-shirts from police, fire and rescue departments around the country. These were displayed along the fence in front of the \\"Lady Liberty\\" replica. Eventually, an official memorial was added from 2003 to 2013. The twin towers of the World Trade Center have never been included in the skyscrapers depicted in the resort's facade; it is claimed the facade is meant to represent New York City in the 1940s, and the World Trade Center was built in the 1970s. The 9/11 Memorial was removed in 2013 for a casino expansion. The US Post Office Statue of Liberty Forever stamp, which was intended to show the actual Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor, actually shows the replica at New York-New York. This is due to an error by the stamp designers, who incorrectly chose a stock photo of the replica instead of the original and did not recognize the difference. Even after the error was recognized, the Postal Service continued producing the stamp. A Postal Service spokesman said the Service ‚Äúwould have selected this photograph anyway\\", citing its popularity and the Postal Service's desire to produce a stamp that appeared different from previous stamps depicting the Statue of Liberty. In 2013 the sculptor of the statue in Las Vegas sued the Postal Service for copyright infringement. His lawyers pointed out that the replica is a distinct piece of art, with intentional variations from the original Statue of Liberty. In July 2018, a judge ordered the U.S. Postal Service to pay Davidson $3.5 million. Attractions Big Apple Coaster The Big Apple Coaster (formerly Manhattan Express and The Roller Coaster) travels through the property's interior and exterior. The coaster is high, has a maximum drop of , and reaches speeds up to . The ride has undergone a variety of enhancements including the introduction of a magnetic braking system and new trains. The roller coaster has trains that resemble a traditional Checker Cab. Zumanity New York-New York is also home to Zumanity, the third show from Cirque du Soleil to take up permanent residence in the Las Vegas area and the first to be directed primarily toward adult audiences. It is the only permanent Cirque show to allow admission only to those over 18 years of age. The theatre is arranged as a cabaret, with sofas and bar stools complementing the standard theatre seats. Restaurants, bars and nightclubs Until June 2010, an ESPN Zone was located in the hotel, accessible from street level and from within the casino. It was a sports- themed restaurant operated by Walt Disney Parks and Resorts' Disney Regional Entertainment division, with an upstairs arcade room full of sports-themed interactive games such as bowling, basketball, football, boxing, golf, horse racing, and auto racing. On October 10, 2010, the hotel re-opened the facility after an extensive remodeling and dubbed it \\"Sporting House\\", catering to the same sporting crowd. The new facility was staffed and maintained by ARK, the food-and-beverage firm which runs other in-house facilities, including the employee dining room (EDR). The Sporting House permanently closed on June 3, 2014, and was successfully subdivided to accommodate Shake Shack and Tom's Urban which opened in late December 2014. The hotel also features nearly a dozen bars and nightclubs, catering to a largely youthful demographic, including Nine Fine Irishmen, the Bar at Times Square (a piano bar), and the Center Bar, the latter of which is located in the center of the main casino floor. On weekend evenings, the casino also features a live DJ and go-go dancers performing on an elevated stage within one of the table game pits, known as the \\"Party Pit\\".

Its major properties included Mandalay Bay, Luxor, Excalibur and Circus Circus, as well as half of the Monte Carlo. In terms of market capitalization, it was one of the largest casino operators in the world. Its stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol \\"CIR\\" and \\"MBG\\". History The company was originally known as Circus Circus Enterprises and originated with Jay Sarno's 1968 opening of the Circus Circus as well as a Circus Circus in Reno, which opened in 1978. The company incorporated as Circus Circus Enterprises (CCE) in 1974 to purchase Circus Circus from Sarno at a time when the casino was experiencing financial difficulties. The original majority owners of CCE were William Pennington, a former oil lease speculator and William Bennett, a former furniture salesman and the manager of The Mint Las Vegas casino. Circus Circus Enterprises purchased the Silver City Casino and Slots-A-Fun Casino in 1979 for $30 million, then refurbished both the interior and exterior. The company went public in 1983 and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The company's properties found success in the 1980s offering a Las Vegas experience to families subsequently experimented upon by its competitors. Its converted Circus Circus (originally developed for the upmarket) and later Excalibur properties offered gaming opportunities for adults and separate non- gambling games and theme-park-style experiences for underage visitors under the same roof. In 1983, Circus Circus purchased the Edgewater Hotel and Casino in Laughlin, Nevada for $17 million. The next year, the company bought the neighboring Colorado Belle casino from Advanced Patent Technology and John Fulton for $4 million. The company planned to move the unprofitable Colorado Belle to make room for an expansion of the Edgewater. The group subsequently developed the Excalibur in 1990, the Luxor in 1993 and the Mandalay Bay in 1999 for which the group was renamed. The group entered into a joint venture in 1993 with Don Carano of Eldorado in Reno to develop and build Reno's largest and tallest megaresort titled Silver Legacy. The $350 million hotel opened on July 28, 1995. Circus Circus Enterprises held a majority stake in that Reno resort. Circus Circus Tunica opened on August 29, 1994. It was rebranded in 1997 as Gold Strike Tunica and given a more upscale theme. The total cost for the remodel was estimated to be $125 million. On March 20, 1995, Circus Circus Enterprises announced that it had agreed to acquire Gold Strike Resorts, a closely held budget casino owner and operator based in Jean, Nevada, in a deal valued at more than $600 million. At the time of the acquisition, Gold Strike Resorts owned the Gold Strike Hotel and Gambling Hall, Nevada Landing Hotel and Casino, Railroad Pass Hotel and Casino and 50% of the under-construction Monte Carlo Resort and Casino. The acquisition did not include the original Gold Strike near Boulder City, because the owners wanted to pass it on to their children. In 1995, Circus Circus purchased the Hacienda from Archon Corporation. By this time, the Hacienda was dwarfed by the many new megaresorts that were being built, in particular the Luxor, which had just been recently completed. On December 10, 1996, the Hacienda was closed to the public after 40 years, and imploded later that month. This implosion was broadcast on the Fox Network as a part of their New Year's Eve 1996 telecast. Despite the implosion, parts of the old resort still stood, due to the building not falling into its footprint, but toppling into its parking lot. The next day a wrecking crew was brought in to bring down the remaining parts. In March 1999, it was replaced by the Mandalay Bay. The group was also a partner with Mirage Resorts on the 1996 opening of the nearby Monte Carlo Resort and Casino. Circus Circus Enterprises closed the Silver City Casino on October 31, 1999. Following the completion of Mandalay Bay in 1999, the name of the company was changed to Mandalay Resorts Group. On December 14, 1999, MotorCity Casino Hotel opened. On May 23, 2002, the Mandalay Resort Group announced a second 1,122-room hotel tower, with a cost of at least $200 million. Construction began on the tower in September 2002. The name of the tower, THEhotel at Mandalay Bay, was chosen in September 2003. The tower opened on December 17, 2003. On June 4, 2004, one of Mandalay's largest competitors, MGM Mirage, announced a bid to acquire it for $68 per share plus assumption of debt. The stock closed at $60.27 per share on June 4. Although the proposal was announced after the close of trading on June 4, the volume of trading in Mandalay Resort Group stock on that day was quadruple the normal, with the stock closing at $60.27 per share. The ensuing negotiations between the two companies included at one point an announcement that the Mandalay board was rejecting the offer because of antitrust concerns. On June 15, 2004, however, both companies' boards approved a revised offer of $71 per share. The agreement called for MGM Mirage to pay $4.8 billion and to assume $2.5 billion in debt. The transaction was completed on April 26, 2005 for $7.9 billion. MGM executives were confident that antitrust regulators would not require the sale of any of the two companies' properties. Michigan law, however, forbade one company from owning multiple casinos, requiring the sale of either the MGM Grand Detroit or Mandalay's 54% stake in the MotorCity Casino. After some vacillation about which property to sell, Mandalay accepted a $525-million offer for its interest in MotorCity from Marian Ilitch, the casino's second largest shareholder.

It covers . In common usage, the term often refers to a smaller area, generally the portion of the drainage basin that lies within eastern Washington. Usage of the term \\"Columbia Basin\\" in British Columbia generally refers only to the immediate basins of the Columbia and Kootenay Rivers and excludes that of the Okanagan, Kettle and Similkameen Rivers.  Description  The Columbia Basin includes the southeastern portion of the Canadian province of British Columbia, most of the U.S. states of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington, the western part of Montana, and very small portions of Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming. The south and southeastern drainage divide borders the interior drainage of the northern Great Basin. To the northeast the region borders the basins of the Saskatchewan River (Hudson Bay) and the MacKenzie River (Beaufort Sea), and to the northwest the basin of the Fraser River. The Columbia Basin extends from the Rocky Mountains in the east through the Cascade Range to the Columbia River's outflow at the Pacific Ocean in the west. The Columbia River pours more water into the Pacific Ocean than any other river in North or South America. In its course to the Pacific Ocean, the Columbia flows through four mountain ranges‚Äîthe Rockies, Selkirks, Cascades, and coastal mountains‚Äîand drains . The mainstem of the Columbia rises in Columbia Lake on the west slope of the Rocky Mountain Range in Canada. Its largest tributary, the Snake, travels from its source in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming before joining the Columbia. When Lewis and Clark explored the region in the early 19th century, huge numbers of fish (salmon) returned to spawn every year. \\"The multitudes of this fish are almost inconceivable,\\" Clark wrote in the autumn of 1805. At that time, the Columbia and its tributaries provided of pristine river habitat.  Common usage  Residents of the area surrounding the confluence of the Columbia and Snake rivers‚Äîa region centering on the Tri- Cities, Washington metropolitan area‚Äîuse the term \\"Columbia Basin\\" to refer to their own, much smaller region. This usage is roughly synonymous with the Columbia Plateau or roughly equivalent to the relatively unforested area bounded by the Cascades, Blue, Wallowa, and Rocky mountain ranges and the Okanagan Highland. This sense of the term Columbia Basin has expanded from its early focus on the land irrigated by Grand Coulee Dam and the Columbia Basin Project to include other irrigation districts such as the Yakima and Walla Walla valleys. At its center is the Pasco Basin, an area roughly double the size of, and fully containing, the Hanford Site.

Written by poet, songwriter, and avowed Quebec nationalist Gilles Vigneault (with music co-written by Gaston Rochon), it was first performed by Vigneault on June 24, 1975 during a concert on Montreal's Mount Royal at that year's F√™te nationale du Qu√©bec ceremony. It quickly became a folk classic, and it has been played frequently at F√™te nationale ceremonies since then. The chorus is by far the most famous part of the song: Gens du pays, c'est votre tour / De vous laisser parler d'amour, which, translated, says, \\"Folks of the land, it is your turn to let you speak of love\\" The song is also associated with the Quebec sovereignty movement and the sovereigntist Parti Qu√©b√©cois, which use it as a sort of anthem. A famous instance of this took place at Ren√© L√©vesque's concession speech after the citizens of the province rejected independence in the 1980 Quebec referendum. At the end of L√©vesque's speech, the crowd assembled to hear him speak stood up at the end of the speech and sang \\"Gens du pays\\", which L√©vesque called \\"the most beautiful Qu√©b√©cois song in the minds of all Quebecers.\\"  Birthday adaptation  In Quebec, a modified version of the chorus is often sung to celebrate a person, for example on a birthday (in the specific case of the birthday, the idea was explicitly introduced by Gilles Vigneault, Yvon Deschamps and Louise Forestier at the song's 1975 introduction): :Mon cher ami (or Ma ch√®re amie), c'est √† ton tour :De te laisser parler d'amour. (\\"My dear friend, it's your turn / To let yourself be lovingly spoken to.\\") Alternatively, \\"ami(e)\\" (friend) is replaced with the name of the person being celebrated. For instance, at Ren√© L√©vesque's funeral, mourners outside the church broke out singing \\"Mon cher Ren√©, c'est √† ton tour, de te laisser parler d'amour\\"  References  1975 songs Quebecois patriotic songs Songs about birthdays Gilles Vigneault songs Songs written by Gilles Vigneault Parti Qu√©b√©cois Political party songs Canadian anthems Regional songs ","title":"Gens du pays"},{"id":"699855","text":"Framheim was the name of explorer Roald Amundsen's base at the Bay of Whales on the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica during his quest for the South Pole. It was used between January 1911 and February 1912.Framheim (Store norske leksikon)  Cabin and tents  The hut was constructed in sections by a master carpenter, J√∏rgen Stubberud and erected at Amundsen's home in Norway, then dismantled for shipment to Antarctica on the Fram. Framheim literally means \\"home of the Fram\\". During its construction in Norway, Amundsen maintained that the hut was for \\"observation\\", which would fit in nicely with his supposed intent to head to the North Pole. To the more than casual student of exploration, it was obvious that the hut was intended as living quarters. Amundsen was, in fact, headed to the South Pole. The cabin was an early example of a pre-fabricated structure, and employed a custom dining table which could retract to the ceiling for cleaning beneath. It measured eight by four meters, and the walls were made up of four layers of three inch wooden boards with cardboard between for insulation. Framheim with tent, dogsled and equipent. During the long Antarctic winter, Amundsen and the members of his expedition constructed a network of workshops and storage rooms, including a steam-bath room, carved out of the ice surrounding the main hut. In this complex the men busied themselves in preparing for the upcoming journey to the South Pole. Amundsen spurned the traditional white tent, and instead dyed his tent material black. He stated that this was to serve three purposes: First, black would absorb what little solar radiation would fall upon the tent. Second, a black tent would provide the best possible contrast against the endless snow and ice if one became lost. And finally, the black provided a rest for the eyes. In addition, the square, pyramid-style tent was equipped with a single central pole that was lashed to one of the sledges in its full length during travel, avoiding the need to assemble tent-poles and making the job of pitching the tent very simple and quick. The tent also featured a sewn- in floor, which was an innovation several years ahead of its time.  Equipment  At Framheim, Amundsen continually upgraded his equipment, since he was largely dissatisfied with standard polar gear. The sledges were refined by shaving down portions of their frames and runners, achieving a 60% weight reduction without compromising their overall strength. Interior of the fuel depot at Framheim Amundsen designed special sledge-cases for food and equipment that remained permanently lashed to the sledges, with access through a lid that could easily be pried off without the need to remove mitts. This saved the time of unloading and re-loading packing boxes when making and breaking camp while on the march, and also eliminated the risk of frostbite when unpacking the sledges. The sledge-cases were also refined during the winter by planing down the wood to reduce their weight. Further, food selection and packing had been refined for both efficiency and maximum space usage. Amundsen brought only four foods: pemmican (made according to his own recipe), chocolate, milk powder and biscuits, although this diet was supplemented by seal and penguin meat stored in the supply depots on the Barrier, and by fresh dog-meat from the dogs that they culled during the journey. This fresh, vitamin-rich meat in their diet prevented the onset of scurvy. To prepare for the trip to the pole, the ski bindings were fitted with hooks so they could be removed during sleeping hours and hung inside the tent. Since the bindings were made of leather, the ravenous sledge dogs would often gnaw at them when the men were asleep. Footwear and the risk of frostbite was a major concern for Amundsen, especially after some negative experiences during the autumn depot-laying trips and the abortive first attempt to reach the Pole. He and his men re-constructed and refined their ski-boots several times before the final polar journey, to obtain maximum insulation against the cold and to provide the necessary flexibility for skiing. Each man brought spare boots in case of breakage or malfunction, with the risk of debilitating frostbite outweighing the issue of weight. None of Amundsen's men experienced frostbitten feet during the polar journey, despite the extreme temperatures.  Fate of the base  The Polar Party returned to Framheim on 25 January 1912 and left in the Fram on 30 January after \\"two days of bustle in getting on board the things we were (to) take with us\\". They left behind the buried hut \\"that strong little house that now lay entirely hidden beneath the snow behind Mount Nelson\\" and doubtless many artefacts. The site on the eastern flank of the Bay of Whales was used extensively in the 1930s by a series of American expeditions led by Richard E. Byrd. They established bases somewhat to the north of Framheim - Little America I to III. There is, however, apparently no definite evidence that the original Framheim hut was rediscovered, possibly because it was deeply buried. Sometime between 1957 and 1962 calving of the Ross Ice Shelf resulted in the block on which Framheim and the Little America bases were sited being detached from the barrier ice. The floe then probably drifted west and progressively broke up along the edge of the Ross Barrier.

The initial story line was published as a three-issue mini- series and then, based on the high sales and interest level generated by this limited series, launched as an ongoing monthly book. Katar Hol and Shayera Thal were rebooted in the prestige format limited series. Publication history The three-issue limited series written and drawn by Timothy Truman and inked by Enrique Alcatena was published in 1989. The ongoing series lasted for four years (1990‚Äì1993) and included 32 issues, along with 3 annuals. Timothy Truman contributed to the plotting of the first six issues, which were scripted by John Ostrander. Ostrander was the sole credited writer for the remainder of the series. After the Hawkworld ongoing series was ended in 1993, a new series simply named Hawkman (vol. 3) picked up the story line and ran from 1993 to 1996. Ostrander wrote the first six issues of this new series, tying up some dangling plot threads from Hawkworld. Plot Katar Hol was a young police officer on the planet Thanagar, and a child of a privileged family. But his homeworld had the policy to conquer and mine other worlds for their resources to maintain its high standard of living, and Hol realized that this was wrong. He rebelled against the system, and was sent into exile. However, 10 years later, he escaped and got the help of Shayera Thal, a young officer from a lower class of society, to uncover and defeat the renegade police captain Byth. As a result, Hol was reinstated in the Wingmen Force and given a new partner, Thal. Themes The primary themes Timothy Truman focused on in the limited series were social inequality and class. When John Ostrander took over the writing duties with the monthly series he continued to develop and expand upon Truman's original ideas. After relocating the setting of the series from Thanagar to the city of Chicago, Katar and Shayera were exposed to the founding documents of the United States as part of their education on America's criminal justice system. Neither characters were familiar with the concept of natural rights and found the contrasts between America's founding principles and the reality of pragmatic governance perplexing. Their different ways of coming to terms with these ideas and the possibility of spreading them back to their home world drove the story lines of the series. Katar was inspired by the possibilities he found in this new way of thinking while Shayera initially rejected them as unrealistic and unworkable. During the series both characters eventually concluded that, much like Thanagar, the United States was also a \\"Hawkworld\\", a predatory society in which the powerful oppress the weak; however, came to see American society as offering more long-term hope for social justice through its embrace of natural rights, even if these values were only embraced on a rhetorical level by most. Continuity Along with its contemporaries The Man of Steel, Batman: Year One, Aquaman Special #1, and Green Lantern: Emerald Dawn, Hawkworld was intended to revise DC Universe continuity for the post-Crisis continuity that explored the origins of the Silver Age Hawkman and Hawkwoman. However, DC editors decided that it was not just an origin story; rather, it was occurring in the present, concurrently with the rest of DC's output (similar to Wonder Woman: Gods and Mortals and The Power of Shazam!). This meant that the Hawks' entire history from the Silver Age onward had to be disregarded, including their memberships in the Justice League (including his brief membership in Justice League International). This began a series of nonstop retcons to the Hawkman characters that ended with a new Hawkman returning in the pages of JSA. During the Brightest Day storyline (2010), Hath-Set has collected the bones from all of Carter's and Shiera's past bodies and created from them a portal to Hawkworld. He was followed, however, by Carter and Shiera. While there, it is revealed that Hawkworld is now under the rulership of Shiera's mother, Queen Khea. There is also a tribe of creatures that resemble Lion-Mane living on Hawkworld.

Calhoun in 1831. Coinage Secretary of State Martin Van Buren was a widower, and since he had no wife to become involved in the Eaton controversy he managed to avoid becoming entangled himself. In 1831 he resigned his cabinet post, as did Secretary of War John Eaton, in order to give Jackson a reason to re-order his cabinet and dismiss Calhoun allies. Jackson then dismissed Calhounites Samuel D. Ingham, John Branch, and John M. Berrien. Van Buren, whom Jackson had already indicated he wanted to run for Vice President in 1832, remained in Washington as a member of the Kitchen Cabinet until he was appointed as Minister to Great Britain. Eaton was subsequently appointed Governor of Florida Territory. Jackson's Kitchen Cabinet included his longtime political allies Martin Van Buren, Francis Preston Blair, Amos Kendall, William B. Lewis, Andrew Jackson Donelson, John Overton, Isaac Hill, and Roger B. Taney. As newspapermen, Blair and Kendall were given particular notice by rival papers.Steven O'Brien, Paula McGuire, James M. McPherson, Gary Gerstle, American Political Leaders: From Colonial Times to the Present, 1991, page 210 Blair was Kendall's successor as editor of the Jacksonian Argus of Western America, the prominent pro-New Court newspaper of Kentucky. Jackson brought Blair to Washington, D.C. to counter Calhounite Duff Green, editor of The United States Telegraph, with a new paper, the Globe. Lewis had been quartermaster under Jackson during the War of 1812; Andrew Donelson was Jackson's adoptive son and private secretary; and Overton was Andrew Jackson's friend and business partner since the 1790s.Theordore Brown, Jr., \\"John Overton,\\" Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture  First known appearance  The first known appearance of the term is in correspondence by Bank of the United States head Nicholas Biddle, who wrote of the presidential advisors that \\"the kitchen ... predominate[s] over the Parlor.\\" The first appearance in publication was March 13, 1832 by Mississippi Senator George Poindexter, in an article in the Calhounite Telegraph defending his vote against Van Buren as minister to Great Britain: > The President's press, edited under his own eye, by a 'pair of deserters > from the Clay party' [Kendall and Blair] and a few others, familiarly known > by the appellation of the 'Kitchen Cabinet,' is made the common reservoir of > all the petty slanders which find a place in the most degraded prints of the > Union.  Popular use  In colloquial use, \\"kitchen cabinet\\" refers to any group of trusted friends and associates, particularly in reference to a president's or presidential candidate's closest unofficial advisers. * Theodore Roosevelt's variant was called the tennis cabinet. These group of friends, diplomats and informal advisors would actually accompany the president and play tennis regularly on the lawn outside the White House. * Clark Clifford was considered a member of the kitchen cabinet for John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson before he was appointed Secretary of Defense. Robert F. Kennedy was uniquely considered to be a kitchen cabinet member as well as a Cabinet member while he was his brother's Attorney General. * Gerald Ford had a kitchen cabinet while vice president, which he continued to seek advice from after he assumed the presidency in August 1974. The group included: Melvin Laird, Bryce Harlow, William Scranton, Robert Griffin, and Donald Rumsfeld. * Ronald Reagan had a kitchen cabinet of allies and friends from California who advised him during his terms. This group of ten to twelve businessmen were all strong proponents of the free enterprise system. His California backers included: Karl Bendetsen, Alfred Bloomingdale, Earl Brian, Justin Whitlock Dart, William French Smith, Charles Wick, oilman William A. Wilson, auto dealer Holmes Tuttle, beer baron Joseph Coors, steel magnate and philanthropist Earle Jorgensen, and about three to five others. Coors was the major funder and most active participant. He also funded many think tanks and policy institutes at about this time, including the Heritage Foundation. In Britain The term was introduced to British policies to describe British Prime Minister Harold Wilson's inner circle during his terms of office (1964-1970 and 1974-1976); prior to Tony Blair, Wilson was the longest serving Labour Party Prime Minister. Members included Marcia Williams, George Wigg, Joe Haines, and Bernard Donoughue. The term has been used subsequently, especially under Tony Blair, for the sidelining of traditional democratic cabinet structures to rely far more on a close group of non-elected advisors and allies. Examples of this practice include Blair's reliance on advisor Andrew Adonis before his appointment to the cabinet. Traditionally, the role of creation of education policy would have rested on the Secretary of State for Education and Skills when formulating policy. In Australia Former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's reliance on a kitchen Cabinet (Treasurer Wayne Swan, Rudd's successor Julia Gillard and Finance Minister Lindsay Tanner) was a factor in his removal as PM. Starting February 2012, Kitchen Cabinet is a TV entertainment series hosted by political commentator Annabel Crabb, in which she interviews notable Australian politicians while preparing and sharing meals with them. In India In India, the quasi-governmental body formerly headed by Sonia Gandhi, called the National Advisory Council, was often referred to as a \\"Kitchen Cabinet\\" by the media and general public, although the government at that time was headed by Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister.

In 1911, he was one of the first five men to reach the South Pole as part of Amundsen's South Pole expedition.  Biography  Olav Olavsen Bjaaland was born on the S√∏ndre Bjaaland farm at Morgedal in Telemark, Norway. At the turn of the century, Bjaaland, together with the Hemmestveit brothers were among the best skiers in Norway. In 1902, he won the nordic combined at the Holmenkollen Ski Festival, to this day the classic event in nordic skiing. In 1909 Bjaaland, together with five others were invited to France to compete with the best skiers of Europe. On this trip, Bjaaland by chance met Roald Amundsen. The already-successful explorer invited Bjaaland to join his forthcoming expedition to the North Pole. Bjaaland was thrilled, and still believing that they were heading to the North Pole. However, they left Oslo, Norway on 7 June 1910 heading south to race for the Antarctic pole against Robert Falcon Scott. South Pole Medal Bjaaland was a skilled carpenter, and on the trip he managed to reduce the prefabricated sledges bought in Oslo (Scott had bought the same type of sledges for his expedition, although never modified them) from 88 kg to 22 kg, without reducing their strength notably. On the actual sledge journey from the Bay of Whales to the pole and return, Bjaaland was often used as a forerunner so that the dogs had something to run after. He was known for being able to ski such that the traces he made formed almost perfect straight lines in the terrain. After returning from the successful conquest of the pole, Amundsen asked Bjaaland to go north with him to explore the Northeast Passage, but he turned down the offer. In later years Bjaaland went back to Telemark and set up a successful ski manufacturing workshop with money lent from Amundsen. In 1961, Bjaaland died peacefully at age 88; of the five to reach the South Pole, he lived the longest, and was the only one to witness the advances made by the IGY in Antarctica, including the construction of the permanent South Pole base named Amundsen‚ÄìScott in honor of his expedition leader. Awards *In 1912, he was awarded the South Pole Medal (Sydpolsmedaljen), a Royal Norwegian award instituted by King Haakon VII in 1912 to reward participants in Roald Amundsen's South Pole expedition. *In 1912, Bjaaland was awarded the Holmenkollen medal (Holmenkollmedaljen), the Norwegian highest competitive award for skiing. *In 1952, at Morgedal, Bjaaland lit the torch for the 1952 Winter Olympics.

XVI: G1, I, mm. 1‚Äì12 left In music, a subject is the material, usually a recognizable melody, upon which part or all of a composition is based. In forms other than the fugue, this may be known as the theme. Characteristics A subject may be perceivable as a complete musical expression in itself, separate from the work in which it is found . In contrast to an idea or motif, a subject is usually a complete phrase or period . The Encyclop√©die Fasquelle defines a theme (subject) as \\"[a]ny element, motif, or small musical piece that has given rise to some variation becomes thereby a theme\\" . Thematic changes and processes are often structurally important, and theorists such as Rudolph Reti have created analysis from a purely thematic perspective (; ). Fred Lerdahl describes thematic relations as \\"associational\\" and thus outside his cognitive-based generative theory's scope of analysis . left In different types of music Music based on a single theme is called 'monothematic', while music based on several themes is called 'polythematic'. Most fugues are monothematic and most pieces in sonata form are polythematic . In the exposition of a fugue, the principal theme (usually called the 'subject') is announced successively in each voice ‚Äì sometimes in a transposed form. In some compositions, a principal subject is announced and then a second melody, sometimes called a 'countersubject' or 'secondary theme', may occur. When one of the sections in the exposition of a sonata-form movement consists of several themes or other material, defined by function and (usually) their tonality, rather than by melodic characteristics alone, the term 'theme group' (or 'subject group') is sometimes used (; ). Music without subjects/themes, or without recognizable, repeating, and developing subjects/themes, is called 'athematic'. Examples include the pre-twelve-tone or early atonal works of Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern, Alban Berg, and Alois H√°ba. Schoenberg once said that, \\"intoxicated by the enthusiasm of having freed music from the shackles of tonality, I had thought to find further liberty of expression. In fact, I ‚Ä¶ believed that now music could renounce motivic features and remain coherent and comprehensible nevertheless\\" . Examples by Schoenberg include Erwartung. Examples in the works of later composers include Polyphonie X and Structures I by Pierre Boulez, Sonata for Two Pianos by Karel Goeyvaerts, and Punkte by Karlheinz Stockhausen . Bach's Fugue No. 2 in C minor from The Well-Tempered Clavier, Book I, BWV 847, showing the subject, answer, and countersubject left Countersubject In a fugue, when the first voice has completed the subject, and the second voice is playing the answer, the first voice usually continues by playing a new theme that is called the 'countersubject'. The countersubject usually contrasts with the subject/answer phrase shape. In a fugue, a countersubject is \\"the continuation of counterpoint in the voice that began with the subject\\", occurring against the answer . It is not usually regarded as an essential feature of fugue, however . The typical fugue opening resembles the following : Soprano voice: _Answer_ Alto voice: _Subject Countersubject_ Since a countersubject may be used both above and below the answer, countersubjects are usually invertible, all perfect fifths inverting to perfect fourths which required resolution .

Themes can be divided into two categories: a work's thematic concept is what readers \\"think the work is about\\" and its thematic statement being \\"what the work says about the subject\\". Themes are often distinguished from premises. The most common contemporary understanding of theme is an idea or point that is central to a story, which can often be summed in a single word (for example, love, death, betrayal). Typical examples of themes of this type are conflict between the individual and society; coming of age; humans in conflict with technology; nostalgia; and the dangers of unchecked ambition. A theme may be exemplified by the actions, utterances, or thoughts of a character in a novel. An example of this would be the thematic idea of loneliness in John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men, wherein many of the characters seem to be lonely. It may differ from the thesis‚Äîthe text's or author's implied worldview. A story may have several themes. Themes often explore historically common or cross-culturally recognizable ideas, such as ethical questions, and are usually implied rather than stated explicitly. An example of this would be whether one should live a seemingly better life, at the price of giving up parts of one's humanity, which is a theme in Aldous Huxley‚Äôs Brave New World. Along with plot, character, setting, and style, theme is considered one of the components of fiction. Techniques Various techniques may be used to express many more themes. Leitwortstil Leitwortstil, which means \\"leading word style\\" in German, is the repetition of a wording, often with a theme, in a narrative to make sure it catches the reader's attention. An example of a leitwortstil is the recurring phrase, \\"So it goes\\", in Kurt Vonnegut's novel Slaughterhouse-Five. Its seeming message is that the world is deterministic: that things only could have happened in one way, and that the future already is predetermined. But given the anti-war tone of the story, the message perhaps is on the contrary, that things could have been different. Its use in Scheherazade's Arabian Nights demonstrates how the technique can result to the unification of the constituent members of story cycles. A non-fictional example of leitwortstil is in the book Too Soon Old, Too Late Smart: Thirty True Things You Need to Know Now written by Gordon Livingston, which is an anthology of personal anecdotes multiple times interjected by the phrases \\"Don't do the same thing and expect different results\\", \\"It is a bad idea to lie to yourself\\", and \\"No one likes to be told what to do\\". In the Bible, various forms of the verb \\"to see\\" also recur and underscore the idea of Abraham as a seer. There is also the repeated use of the root kbd in Samuel I, to indicate \\"weightiness, honor, glory\\". In New Testament studies, a leitwortstil is called a verbal thread. David Rhoads, Joanna Dewey, and Donald Michie identify several verbal threads in their seminal narrative-critical study of the Gospel of Mark.David Rhoads, Joanna Dewey, and Donald Michie, Mark as Story: An Introduction to the Narrative of a Gospel, 3rd ed. (Minneapolis, MN: Fortress Press, 2012), 48. For example, Mark ties together two disparate narratives with a verbal thread that forces the reader to search for connections between the narratives. The word for ripping or tearing (Greek: œÉœáŒØŒ∂œâ, schiz≈ç) is found at the baptism of Jesus in Mark 1:10 and at the rending of the temple veil in Mark 15:38. Similarly, the word for ‚Äúcharcoal Ô¨Åre‚Äù (Greek: ·ºÄŒΩŒ∏œÅŒ±Œ∫Œπ√°, anthrakia) occurs only twice in the New Testament: in the setting of Peter‚Äôs denial (John 18:18) and in his restoration (John 21:9).James L. Resseguie, Narrative Criticism of the New Testament: An Introduction (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2005), 44. Again, the verbal thread forces the reader to search for connections between the narratives. Thematic patterning Thematic patterning means the insertion of a recurring motif in a narrative.Pinault, David. 1992. Story- telling techniques in the Arabian nights. Leiden: Brill. p. 22. For example, various scenes in John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men are about loneliness. Thematic patterning is evident in One Thousand and One Nights, an example being the story of \\"The City of Brass\\". According to David Pinault, the overarching theme of that tale, in which a group of travelers roam the desert in search of ancient brass artifacts, is that \\"riches and pomp tempt one away from God\\".Pinault, David. 1992. Story-telling techniques in the Arabian nights. Leiden: Brill. p. 23. The narrative is interrupted several times by stories within the story. These include a tale recorded in an inscription found in the palace of Kush ibh Shaddad; a story told by a prisoner about Solomon; and an episode involving Queen Tadmur's corpse. According to Pinault, \\"each of these minor narratives introduces a character who confesses that he once proudly enjoyed worldly prosperity: subsequently, we learn, the given character has been brought low by God ... These minor tales ultimately reinforce the theme of the major narrative\\".  Examples  Some common themes in literature are \\"love,\\" \\"war,\\" \\"revenge,\\" \\"betrayal,\\" \\"patriotism,\\" \\"grace,\\" \\"isolation,\\" \\"motherhood,\\" \\"forgiveness,\\" \\"wartime loss,\\" \\"treachery,\\" \\"rich versus poor,\\" \\"appearance versus reality,\\" and \\"help from other-worldly powers.\\" See also * Literary element * Moral * Motif (narrative)  Notes  References  Literary concepts Narrative units Fiction ","title":"Theme (narrative)"},{"id":"699916","text":"The Spanish web is an aerial circus skill in which a performer climbs and performs various tricks on an apparatus resembling a vertically hanging rope. It is similar in appearance and performance style to the corde lisse, but with the addition of loops on the rope for hands or feet, permitting one to perform a variety of spinning motions. The name refers to both the apparatus and the performance. Rope structure The apparatus is akin to a larger kernmantle rope. Unbraided cotton or polyster-blend rope is pulled through a soft, round, cotton sleeve two inches in diameter (a \\"web\\"). An eye is made in one end of the web, to which a swivel is attached. That is suspended at one end from the overhead rigging. Towards the top of the web, a hand, foot or neck loop is attached to the main rope through which a performer will secure an ankle, wrist or their neck and be able to hang freely while spinning. Performance In a typical Spanish web performance, there is a climber (or flyer) and a web setter. The web setter typically kneels on one knee, and the climber can climb first on the setter's thigh before ascending the web. Once the climber has ascended the web, the web setter can spin the web around the performer, creating enough centrifugal force to push the performer into a near-horizontal position. Web setting is a specialty skill in its own right, with a lot more difficulty than one might expect. While spinning, the climber can hold on to the web in addition to hanging from the loop or can release the rope and spin that way. With the addition of an extra swivel attached between the loop and the web, it is possible for the performer to also spin separately from the rope. Spanish web skills are often combined with the skills of corde lisse, which does not utilize a loop or a web setter, but is a stationary rope which the performer winds into different knots around the body, performing various drops and locking positions. One of the rigging challenges with Spanish web is arresting the torquing forces involved. These forces must be arrested within the rigging systems and that usually involves extra guy lines, gusset plates, diagonal bracing and other such techniques.

The character has been featured in various media adaptations, such as feature films, television series and video games. Publication history The character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #400 (June 1970) and was created by Frank Robbins and Neal Adams in collaboration with editor Julius Schwartz. The Man-Bat was the star of his own eponymous series in 1975‚Äì1976, which lasted two issues before being cancelled. Fictional character biography Dr. Kirk Langstrom, a zoologist who specialized in the study of chiropterology, developed an extract intended to give humans a bat's acute sonar sense and tested the formula on himself. The extract worked, but it had a horrible side effect: it transformed him into a monstrous human/bat hybrid creature. This side effect made him so distraught that it temporarily affected his sanity and he went on a mad rampage until Batman found a way to reverse the effects. Later, Langstrom takes the concoction again and the Man-Bat returns. He also coaxes his wife, Francine Langstrom, into drinking the serum and she goes through the same transformation, becoming the She-Bat. Together, they terrorize Gotham City until Batman once again restores them to normal. On some occasions, Langstrom takes the serum and retains enough sanity to work for the forces of good. During one of these periods, he works with the detective Jason Bard. On another occasion, in Action Comics #600, Jimmy Olsen inadvertently puts Superman into a cave occupied by the Man-Bat to protect him from kryptonite radiation that had reached Earth following the explosion of Krypton. The Man- Bat calms the maddened Superman and then summons Hawkman, who helps Superman overcome the radiation. Kirk and Francine have a daughter, Rebecca (\\"Becky\\"), and a son, Aaron. Because of the effects the serum had on Aaron's DNA, he is born with a deadly illness. Francine turns him into a young Man-Bat to save his life. This occurred in issue #3 of the Man-Bat miniseries by Chuck Dixon. Infinite Crisis and beyond The Man-Bat is sighted in Alexander Luthor, Jr.'s Secret Society of Super Villains during the events of the 2005‚Äì2006 storyline Infinite Crisis.Infinite Crisis #7 (June 2006) In the aftermath of that storyline, both Kirk and Francine are shown to be alive in the 2006 \\"One Year Later\\" storyline. Talia al Ghul binds and gags Francine, and then threatens to poison her if Kirk does not give her the Man-Bat formula. After Langstrom gives her the formula, she releases Francine as promised. Talia utilizes the Man-Bat to turn some generic members of the League of Assassins into Man-Bat Commandos.Batman #655 (September 2006) Cover of Man-Bat (vol. 3) #3 (August 2006).

The Man-Bat serum first appears in Detective Comics #18 (May 2013). Ignatius Ogilvy also comes into possession of the Man-Bat serum, which he uses as an airborne virus to spread throughout Gotham City's \\"900 Block\\".Detective Comics #18 (May 2013) In Detective Comics (vol. 2) #19 (June 2013), Kirk Langstrom first appears where he and his wife Francine are escorted by Batwoman to Batman's location. Langstrom reveals that he is the creator of the serum, intending to help deaf people. Taking responsibility as the creator of the serum, he uses a sample of the serum Batman had obtained to inject himself. This creates an anti-virus which also spreads through the air. Langstrom is turned into a Man-Bat (the last remaining Man-Bat) as his anti-virus cures the remaining citizens of Gotham. Langstrom re-appears in Batman Inc. (vol. 2) #10 (June 2013) apparently giving Batman the serum. He claims to be working on an aerosol antidote to the serum as well.Batman Inc.

Bane arrives at Blackgate as the Man-Bat and his fellow Man-Bats are attempting to transport the Talons to Mr. Freeze and is able to keep one from leaving.Forever Evil: Arkham War #2 The final issues of the Batman: The Dark Knight series would establish that Kirk is the son of a corrupt wealthy pharmaceutical businessman named Abraham Langstrom, who considers his son as a failure when compared to Bruce Wayne, the son of his business rival Thomas Wayne. Abraham would steal his son's serum, make some of his own improvements and use it to target the homeless (because no one would miss them) before being stopped by Batman, though he is able to plead temporary insanity to avoid going to prison.Batman: The Dark Knight (vol. 2) #28-29 DC Rebirth In the Watchmen sequel Doomsday Clock, the Man-Bat is featured on the news as an example of the \\"Superman Theory\\" where the government has been experimenting on humans to give them superpowers.Doomsday Clock #3 (January 2018).

In Harley Quinn Rebirth, Langstrom's wife goes on a rampage against Harley and her friends, turning Harley and her friend Tony into Man-Bats as part of the Penguin's plan to break Harley's spirit. Their other friends get Langstrom released and he helps them find the antidote before predictably escaping himself. Powers and abilities By taking his bat-gland formula, Kirk Langstrom can transform himself into a bat-like creature. By taking an antidote or if the bat-gland formula wears off, he can return to human form. As the Man-Bat, his strength, agility and endurance are all enhanced to superhuman levels. Kirk possesses an extra set of digits that form leathery bat wings that allow him to fly, super- sensitive hearing, and sonar. He emits high-pitched sound waves and can hear the echoes they make when they bounce off nearby objects, enabling the Man-Bat to navigate perfectly in pitch black darkness. If in the Man-Bat form for a prolonged time, he loses control over his bestial side and works purely on instinct, making him prone to harm friend and foe alike. Other characters named Man-Bat Man-Bat Commandos As mentioned above, Talia al Ghul captured Kirk Langstrom and threatened to poison Francine if he did not give her the Man-Bat formula. Kirk gives in to Talia al Ghul's commands where she uses the Man-Bat formula on some generic members of the League of Assassins to turn them into the group's Man-Bat Commandos. In The New 52 (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), various Man-Bats have appeared under the control of Talia al Ghul in her plot to destroy Batman.Batman, Inc. (vol. 2) #1 It is later explained that Talia al Ghul had an agent steal the serum from Langstrom's laboratory to use on her soldiers to create the Man-Bat Commandos.Detective Comics #19 (June 2013) During the \\"Forever Evil\\" storyline, some Man-Bat Commandos were used to help the Crime Syndicate hunt down the Rogues.

Years after the death of Thomas and Martha, Abraham continued his shady deals which involved exploiting his son's Man-Bat serum which he plans to make a profit on it. He soon became addicted to the upgraded serum. When he became Man-Bat, Abraham targeted the homeless people of Gotham City and draining them of his blood. This caused Batman to team up with Kirk Langstrom to fight Abraham.Batman: The Dark Knight Vol. 2 #28. DC Comics. Because the skin of Abraham's Man-Bat form was tough, Batman injected himself with the cure and tricked Abraham into drinking his blood enough to regress back to normal. Batman then handed Abraham over to the police. After evading incarceration by claiming that he had no knowledge on what his Man-Bat form did, Abraham returned to his company, though he is weary over the fact that Batman will catch him when he makes a mistake.Batman: The Dark Knight Vol. 2 #29.

However, Francine developed an aggressive form of Parkinson's and had a short life expectancy, leading Kirk to try and perfect the Man-Bat serum to save her life, but by the time he did it, it was too late. Following this, his children left him, angered that he did not spend as much time with her during her final days. Devastated by \\"losing\\" his family, Kirk turned to the serum, which has been perfected to the point where he is able to talk and control his actions, and had been living in secret as the Man-Bat ever since.

When Bruce Wayne begins to cut off the funding for his project, Langstrom tells Bruce that he needs the project to cure his niece's deafness. When Bruce discovers that Langstrom is lying, he goes to Langstrom's office to discover both Langstrom's obsession with Batman and the project's real purpose. Langstrom arrived in his vault to find his boss there; he admits that he created the formula so he could be feared like Batman, and drinks a serum, resulting in his Man-Bat transformation. He attacks Bruce at his office, and escapes. Batman confronts the Man-Bat in Gotham City's skies, landing on the ground, and Langstrom reverts to his human form.

After several encounters, Batman creates an antidote and injects it into the Man-Bat to change him back to Kirk Langstrom, locking him in the Batmobile's trunk while the process completes. Once at the Gotham City Police Station, Batman then places Kirk in an isolation cell. Kirk is last seen crying in his cell over his role in Francine's death. If Batman walks inside Langstrom's laboratory after this side mission, he discovers Francine's body gone and a blooded painting on the broken window which says \\"Forever my love\\", implying that she became the She-Bat. If the date on the console or computer the game is on is changed to October 31 (Halloween) to any year, grappling around buildings will eventually make the Man-Bat jumpscare occur once again. Returning to the Gotham City Police Department and speaking to Officer Boulden will reveal that Kirk Langstrom apparently morphed back into the Man-Bat and broke out of his cage with Cash firing at him, but missing due to the speed at which he flew. Batman will state \\"I was afraid this would happen\\", prompting Boulden to reply with \\"Happy Halloween, huh?\\" * The Man-Bat appears as a playable character in Lego DC Super-Villains. He is playable via the \\"Batman: The Animated Series Level Pack\\" DLC. Web series * The parallel version of Kirk Langstrom's Batman appears in Justice League: Gods and Monsters Chronicles (a companion to Justice League: Gods and Monsters), voiced by Michael C. Hall. In the first episode, he defeats Harley Quinn, who he kills by sucking her blood instead of taking her to the police. Miscellaneous * In issue #28 of the Super Friends comics, the Man-Bat made an appearance as one of the five foes that the Super Friends battle. * In The Batman Adventures (a comic series based on Batman: The Animated Series), another Man-Bat was formed when Dr. Stefen Perry stole the Man-Bat serum from Langstrom. He was defeated by Batman and arrested by the police. In issue #21, Kirk Langstrom was later forcefully transformed into the Man-Bat and recruited by Dr. Emile Dorian, who hoped to use his assistance to form a \\"House of Dorian\\" with Anthony Romulus's werewolf form, Tygrus (who Emile duped into working for him again), and the Man-Bat. * The Man-Bat appears in issue #12 of the All-New Batman: The Brave and the Bold (which is based on Batman: The Brave and the Bold). * In issue #4 of the comic book spin-off Beware the Batman, a new Man- Bat appears in the form of Tim Quan, an acquaintance of Barbara Gordon with a crush on her. He was mutated when he snuck into the laboratory of Kirk Langstrom (who is still stuck in his Man-Bat form and was looking for a cure). Having become more unstable than Langstrom, Quan goes in a rampage and kidnaps Barbara. Batman teams up with Langstrom to find and cure Quan at the expense of Langstrom's own cure.

It connects the cities of Niagara Falls, New York, United States (to the east), and Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada (west). Construction The Rainbow Bridge was built near the site of the earlier Honeymoon Bridge, which collapsed on January 27, 1938, due to an ice jam in the river. A joint Canadian and American commission had been considering a new bridge to replace it, and the collapse added urgency to the project. Engraved text on the bridge includes a biblical reference to rainbows (click on image to read). A design by architect Richard (Su Min) Lee was chosen (and used again for the Lewiston-Queenston Bridge, approximately downriver). The bridge's Rainbow Tower and Canadian plaza are the work of Canadian architect William Lyon Somerville. King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, during their visit to Niagara Falls as part of the 1939 royal tour of Canada, dedicated the site of the Rainbow Bridge; a monument was erected to commemorate the occasion. Construction began in May 1940. The bridge officially opened on November 1, 1941. The origin of the bridge's name is unknown, with one possible source being T. B. McQuesten, then chairman of the Niagara Parks Commission. An engraving on the Canadian side of the bridge includes a biblical quote from the Book of Genesis which references a \\"bow in the clouds.\\" Regardless of its origin, the NRBC used the name as early as March 1939.  Description and specifications  The New York State Department of Transportation designates the bridge as NY 955A, an unsigned reference route, while the Ontario Ministry of Transportation designates it as part of Highway 420 (and the original routing of the Queen Elizabeth Way), even though it is separated from the rest of the route by a regional road. On the American side, a number of state and national routes end at a set of intersections in front of the bridge. New York routes 104 and 384, as well as the northern section of the Robert Moses State Parkway, all terminate at the final intersection before the bridge, and none of the designations passes onto the bridge. U.S. Route 62 terminates two blocks north at route 104, which then continues to the bridge. The Rainbow Tower, part of the plaza complex on the Canadian side, houses a large carillon, which plays several times daily. The bridge permits no commercial trucks; the nearest border crossing for these is the Lewiston-Queenston Bridge. The toll to cross the bridge for each pedestrian and bicycle is $1.00 US or CAD, and $3.75 US or $5.00 CAD for automobiles as of February 2018. Car tolls are collected when leaving the United States. Pedestrian toll is collected by an automatic turnstile when leaving Canada, payable in U.S. or CAD quarters or $1 CAD 'loonies'. Change machines are available from $1 and $5 US bills and $1 (loonies) and $2 (toonies) Canadian coins.

He was General Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia from 1987 until 1989. He resigned from his position in late November 1989, amid the Velvet Revolution.  Early life  Jake≈° was born in ƒåesk√© Chalupy near ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice. He grew up in a poor village family in the ≈†umava borderlands before working in Bata Shoes factory in Zl√≠n between 1937 and 1950. He joined the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia soon after World War II, triggering his steady rise within the party ranks. In 1955 he began his studies at Moscow's Party's Higher College and, after obtaining his degree in 1958, his career continued without interruption, undisturbed even during the 1968 Prague Spring period. After the Soviet invasion, Jake≈° became one of the main initiators of the political purges carried out in the name of \\"normalization\\".  Party leader  Following the ouster of Gust√°v Hus√°k at a dramatic party meeting in December 1987, Jake≈° was nominated for the position of General Secretary by the competing factions within the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. Following his rise to power, Jake≈° began to promote himself as a supporter of glasnost and perestroika. Yet, despite the Communist Party's attempt to appease the public's demands for reform, Jake≈° remained staunchly opposed to any dialogue with the growing opposition movement in the country. Even when the Velvet Revolution broke out, Jake≈° refused to consider any serious talks with the opposition. Events soon overtook him, and on 24 November he resigned along with the party's entire Presidum. The Communists officially abandoned power four days later. As General Secretary Jake≈° used the first name Milo≈°. During the trial it was revealed that his actual name is Milou≈°.  Speech in ƒåerven√Ω Hradek  Jake≈° gained unwanted fame through his famous speech addressed to local party workers in ƒåerven√Ω Hr√°dek close to Plze≈à. When speaking about the necessity of Gorbachev-inspired \\"perestroika\\", he presented himself and the party as a lonely pole plank being allegedly left alone to overcome the hardships. On the same occasion he mistook the word broiler (type of chicken) for boiler and spoke in an embarrassingly familiar way about some Czech pop music singers when pointing to their allegedly super- high incomes (\\"None of us earns so much!\\"). His speech had been recorded by a journalist from Czech television who managed to secretly make a copy of the tape. The recording was frequently copied among the people in the summer of 1989 and afterwards. ‚Äî history of the recording from ƒåerven√Ω Hr√°dek and its leakage from the Czech Television (video)  Later life  Jake≈° lived in Prague as an ordinary pensioner and used to be a frequent guest at the present-day Communists' rallies.

In 1969, he joined the Plastic Ono Band after John Lennon invited him to play at the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival festival. White went on to play on other recordings from artists such as George Harrison, Ginger Baker's Air Force, and Terry Reid, and Lennon's \\"Imagine\\". White joined Yes in July 1972 as a replacement for original drummer, Bill Bruford. Following the death of bassist Chris Squire in 2015, White became the longest-remaining member in the band, having never left the group since joining. Additionally, White has performed on over 50 albums by other performers, notably Joe Cocker, Ginger Baker, and The Ventures. White was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Yes in 2017. Biography Early life White was born on 14 June 1949 in the village of Pelton, County Durham in north east England. His father had different jobs, working as a clerk, shop keeper, and a lorry and bus driver who also played the piano in local pubs. His grandfather played the piano and his uncle was a drummer in local dance bands. He attended a technical school and, at age seven, moved to the nearby town of Ferryhill, where he spent the rest of his childhood. At age six, White began to take piano lessons, playing the instrument \\"very percussively\\", which his uncle noticed and informed his parents who bought him an Ajax drum kit for Christmas when he was twelve. White names his uncle as a big influence. White felt he was pushed to learn and play like his drum instructor and wished \\"to be more individual\\" on the instrument, so he began to develop his own style. His parents went on to buy him a metallic silver Ludwig kit. Early bands and session work Several months into formal drumming lessons, White joined his first band, a local group named the Downbeats, at thirteen. They performed songs by the Beatles, the Searchers, and Gerry and the Pacemakers. The group became well known in the Newcastle area, playing working men's clubs and dance halls as much as seven nights a week until late. White's school teachers only found out about his activities when the band were featured in the local newspaper. During his time in the band, White also had a paper route. In 1964, the Downbeats changed their name to the Blue Chips and travelled to London to enter an amateur band contest held at the London Palladium by Melody Maker. They won the contest and were awarded with money, new equipment, and recording contract and recorded several singles which did not chart. They returned home, and disbanded soon after. White reduced his music commitments in order to pass his school exams, after which he became interested in studying technical drawing at college with the plan to become an architect. However, at seventeen, White chose to pursue music and toured the cabaret circuit as part of Billy Fury's band the Gamblers, which included several gigs in Germany. White went on to play in Happy Magazine, later known as Griffin, with Alan Marshall and Kenny Craddock, and put out several records with Alan Price as their producer. White continued to tour and play with Price in his group, the Alan Price Set and took up several jobs as a session musician. In 1969, White received a call from John Lennon who invited him to join his Plastic Ono Band for their live performance at the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival festival. Lennon had attended a Griffin performance in a club and wanted White to join the band of Yoko Ono, Eric Clapton, and Klaus Voorman. White disbelieved Lennon's call and offer and thought he was a prankster, but accepted the invitation for the show which took place on 13 September 1969 at Varsity Stadium in front of 20,000 people. The set was later released as a live album, Live Peace in Toronto 1969. The gig landed White further session jobs, including drum work on Imagine and \\"Instant Karma!\\" for Lennon and All Things Must Pass by George Harrison, as well as the openings track, the epic Govinda, for The Radha Krsna Temple (produced by George Harrison).\\"George Harrison Produces Govinda Radha Krshna Temple\\", (Beatles Bible, retrieved 17 November 2018) Around the same time, White worked with Denny Laine in his band Balls for several months, which was followed by a ten-week stint with the fifteen- piece band, Ginger Baker's Air Force and a period with Steve Winwood and Terry Reid. With Yes White performing in 2010 To save time commuting to London from the house he shared with his Griffin bandmates in Sussex, White shared a flat with engineer and producer Eddy Offord who worked with Yes on their albums and tours. In early 1972, White attended their session at Advision Studios to record a promotional film for their cover of \\"America\\" by Simon & Garfunkel. Soon after, he turned up to one of their rehearsals of \\"Siberian Khatru\\", a song for their fifth album, Close to the Edge. Their drummer Bill Bruford had to leave the session early, leaving White to sit in with the band for the rest of it. White then joined Chris Stainton's All Stars for a European tour in support of Joe Cocker, which included a show at the Rainbow Theatre in London that Yes bassist Chris Squire attended. On 19 July 1972, after Yes had finished recording Close to the Edge, Bruford left to join King Crimson. With their supporting tour less than a week away, the band were desperate for a replacement. White then got a call from Tony Dimitriades, who handled Offord's affairs and later became Yes's manager, informing White that the band wanted him to join. Anderson and Squire then met White at Offord's flat, and White agreed to join. He spent the following three days learning the band's repertoire before the Close to the Edge Tour began in Dallas, Texas on 30 July 1972.Welch C (2008), \\"Close to the Edge: The Story of Yes\\", Omnibus Press In the same week, White was offered to join Jethro Tull and America. White's performance was documented on their first live album Yessongs, in 1973; this was followed by his first studio album with them later that year, Tales from Topographic Oceans. White released his only solo album, Ramshackled, in 1976. White only performed drums on the album and wrote none of the songs. In addition to his drum playing, White has played piano and written music for several Yes albums. Due to various health problems, White missed a tour with Yes in 2016, with Jay Schellen substituting for him. Schellen and White then toured together into 2017. On summer 2017 touring, White was accompanied by Dylan Howe (son of guitarist Steve Howe), with Schellen returning to the role in early 2018. In 2020, White mentioned Drama as one of his favorite Yes albums and stated ‚ÄúIt was very unique material. It wasn‚Äôt like the other stuff that we did before and after.‚Äù He also revealed he wrote ‚ÄúIn The Presence Of‚Äù in the middle of the night.  Other projects  White had guested with local Seattle band MerKaBa on a number of occasions and White and MerKaBa also had links with another local band, Treason. In 2003, White joined sessions for a new MerKaBa album, but these evolved into a new band, called White, and an album's worth of demo recordings under the name Loyal. As well as Alan, the band consisted of Kevin Currie (from MerKaBa; lead vocals), Karl Haug (from Treason); electric & acoustic guitars, lap steel), Steve Boyce (from MerKaBa; bass, guitar, backing vocals) and Ted Stockwell (from Treason and MerKaBa; keys, guitar). Stockwell left the band and, in April 2005, was replaced by Alan's former colleague in Yes, keyboardist Geoff Downes. A new album, White, was recorded, partly based on the Loyal demos. The album was released in 2006, with a cover by Roger Dean. The band has played live (with various keyboardists) in the Seattle area. They were due to join the abortive More Drama Tour, scheduled to begin in North America in August 2005, with three acts: White, The Syn, and Steve Howe, with Yes members Chris Squire, Steve Howe and Geoff Downes playing Yes material at the end of the evening (with Currie handling lead vocals). However, the tour was cancelled shortly before it was due to begin. White later joined The Syn touring band for dates in the first half of 2006. Subsequently, White has been working on projects with Billy Sherwood, notably in the initial line-up of Circa, with a third Yes alumnus, Tony Kaye. In 2010, the band White re-emerged after a hiatus with a new line-up of White, Haug and Boyce joined by two musicians from Yes tribute band Parallels, who have previously worked with Alan: vocalist Robyn Dawn and keyboardist Jonathan Sindelman. On 28 October 2017, to celebrate his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, White played Roundabout in a halftime performance with the University of Washington Husky Marching Band, also featuring music from Pearl Jam, Journey, and Electric Light Orchestra.  Personal life  White has been married for over 20 years to his wife Gigi. They have two children, Jesse (also a musician) and Cassi. He currently lives in Newcastle, Washington. White was best man to Jon Anderson's wedding in 1997. White has also served as the Grand Marshal at the Issaquah Salmon Days festival in Washington, USA.

It was especially popular in the Middle Ages and has been used by many composers as the basis of other compositions. Background The creation of the original hymn has been attributed to several people, including Bernard of Clairvaux (12th century), Saint Venantius Fortunatus (6th century) and Hermannus Contractus (11th century). Frauenlob's song of songs by Frauenlob, Barbara Newman, Karl Stackmann 2007 page 100 The text is not found written by 9th-century hands, but as a tenth-century addition in two 9th- century manuscripts, one from Salzburg now in Vienna Cod. Vindob. 387, fol. 3v, has a fragmentary version written by a later hand (10th/11th century) in originally blank space and the other still at the Abbey of Saint Gall.Codex Sangallensis 95, p. 2, has a full version written by a later hand (10th/11th century) on originally blank space Its frequent occurrence in the Divine Office made it popular in the Middle Ages, many other hymns being founded upon it. The \\"Ave maris stella\\" was highly influential in presenting Mary as a merciful and loving Mother.Reynolds, Brian. Gateway to heaven, New City Press, 2012, , p. 194 \\"Much of its charm is due to its simplicity\\".Brittain, F., Mediaeval Latin and Romance Lyric to A, Cambridge University Press, 1951, p. 79 The title, \\"Star of the Sea\\" is one of the oldest and most widespread titles applied to Mary. The hymn is frequently used as a prayer for safe- conduct for travelers.\\"Ave Maris Stella Prayer\\", International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton The melody is found in the Irish plainsong \\"Gabhaim Molta Br√≠de\\", a piece in praise of St. Brigid of Kildaire. The popular modern hymn Hail Queen of Heaven, the Ocean Star, is loosely based on this plainsong original.  Latin lyrics  chant setting The Latin text of the hymn as authorized for use in the Liturgy of the Hours of the Roman Rite (ordinary form) is the following:Liber Hymnarius, Solesmes, 1983. Musical settings The plainchant hymn has been developed by many composers from pre- baroque to the present day. The Roman Rite employs four different plainchant tunes for the Ave maris stella; the first three are designated for solemnities, feasts, and memorials of the Blessed Virgin Mary; a fourth is given in the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary as an alternative to the memorial tone. These plainchant tones have been used as the cantus firmus for some polyphonic settings of the mass, including those by Josquin and Victoria.The Josquin companion: Volume 1 by Richard Sherr 2001 Page 110 Renaissance settings include those by Hans Leo Hassler, Felice Anerio, Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, Dufay and Byrd. Baroque settings include Monteverdi's Vespro della Beata Vergine 1610, one by Emperor Leopold I, Marc- Antoine Charpentier, 4 sets, H 60, H 63, H 65, H 67. S√©bastien de Brossard, Romantic settings include those by Dvorak, Grieg, and Liszt. Modern composers who have either set the text or used the hymn as an inspiration include Marcel Dupr√©, Flor Peeters, Grace Williams, Peter Maxwell Davies, Otto Olsson, Trond Kverno, Jean Langlais, Mark Alburger, James MacMillan, Andrew Cusworth and Roderick Williams.  Acadian anthem  \\"Ave Maris Stella\\" is the anthem of the Acadians, a francophone community in the Canadian Maritimes distinct from the French-Canadians of Quebec. The Acadians were highly devout, and had and still have a high degree of devotion to the Virgin Mary. As such, Acadia's symbols reflect its people's beliefs. This is particularly evident in their anthem which instead of being written in French is written in Latin. It was adopted as the anthem of the Acadian people at the Second Acadian National Convention, held in Miscouche, Prince Edward Island in 1884.\\"What is the national Acadian anthem?\\", Acadian Museum of Prince Edward Island To this day, it remains a source of Acadian patriotism. The hymn was sung in its original version until French lyrics were finally composed in 1988. The French lyrics are attributed to Jacinthe Laforest, from Mont-Carmel, Prince Edward Island, who submitted her lyrics during a contest held throughout the Maritimes by the Soci√©t√© nationale de l'Acadie in search of French lyrics. Out of respect for the original hymn, the first verse in the Acadian national anthem remains in Latin. These are the lyrics, in French. The first verse is in Latin, and is repeated at the end of the hymn.

He is also credited for developing a theory of causal and counterfactual inference based on structural models (see article on causality). In 2011, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) awarded Pearl with the Turing Award, the highest distinction in computer science, \\"for fundamental contributions to artificial intelligence through the development of a calculus for probabilistic and causal reasoning\\". Judea Pearl is the father of journalist Daniel Pearl, who was kidnapped and murdered by terrorists in Pakistan connected with Al-Qaeda and the International Islamic Front in 2002 for his American and Jewish heritage. Biography Judea Pearl was born in Tel Aviv, British Mandate for Palestine, in 1936 to Polish Jewish immigrant parents.http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/features/.premium-1.640044 He is a descendant of Menachem Mendel of Kotzk on his mother's side. After serving in the Israel Defense Forces and joining a kibbutz, Pearl decided to study engineering in 1956. He received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the Technion 1960. That same year, he emigrated to the United States and pursued graduate studies. He received an M.S. in Electrical Engineering from the Newark College of Engineering (now the New Jersey Institute of Technology) in 1961, and went on to receive an M.S. in Physics from Rutgers University and a PhD in Electrical Engineering from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn (now the New York University Tandon School of Engineering) in 1965. He worked at RCA Research Laboratories (now SRI International in Princeton, New Jersey) on superconductive parametric amplifiers and storage devices and at Electronic Memories, Inc., on advanced memory systems. When semiconductors \\"wiped out\\" Pearl's work, as he later expressed it, he joined UCLA's School of Engineering in 1970 and started work on probabilistic artificial intelligence. He is one of the founding editors of the Journal of Causal Inference. Pearl is currently a professor of computer science and statistics and director of the Cognitive Systems Laboratory at UCLA. He and his wife, Ruth, had three children. In addition, , he is a member of the International Advisory Board of NGO Monitor. Former Israeli Chief Rabbi, Rabbi Yisrael Meir Lau, partnered with Judea Pearl in the documentary With My Whole Broken Heart. Murder of Daniel Pearl In 2002, his son, Daniel Pearl, a journalist working for the Wall Street Journal was kidnapped and murdered in Pakistan, leading Judea and the other members of the family and friends to create the Daniel Pearl Foundation. On the seventh anniversary of Daniel's death, Judea wrote an article in the Wall Street Journal titled Daniel Pearl and the Normalization of Evil: When will our luminaries stop making excuses for terror?. Emeritus Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks quoted Judea Pearl's beliefs in a lesson on Judaism: \\"I asked Judea Pearl, father of the murdered journalist Daniel Pearl, why he was working for reconciliation between Jews and Muslims, he replied with heartbreaking lucidity, 'Hate killed my son. Therefore I am determined to fight hate.'\\" Views On his religious views, Pearl states that he doesn't believe in God. He is very connected to Jewish traditions such as daily prayer, tefillin, and Kiddush on Friday night. In an interview with Heeb Magazine, he is \\"... trying to educate our children and live under God.\\" He believes that Jews have always expected a return to Israel as expressed in songs, prayers and holidays. Research Judea Pearl was one of the pioneers of Bayesian networks and the probabilistic approach to artificial intelligence, and one of the first to mathematize causal modeling in the empirical sciences. His work is also intended as a high-level cognitive model. He is interested in the philosophy of science, knowledge representation, nonstandard logics, and learning. Pearl is described as \\"one of the giants in the field of artificial intelligence\\" by UCLA computer science professor Richard Korf. His work on causality has \\"revolutionized the understanding of causality in statistics, psychology, medicine and the social sciences\\" according to the Association for Computing Machinery.

Opposite sides of hexagon have the same color. cyclic hexagon (right) lie on the Pascal line MNP (left). Self-crossing hexagon , inscribed in a circle. Its sides are extended so that pairs of opposite sides intersect on Pascal's line. Each pair of extended opposite sides has its own color: one red, one yellow, one blue. Pascal's line is shown in white. In projective geometry, Pascal's theorem (also known as the hexagrammum mysticum theorem) states that if six arbitrary points are chosen on a conic (which may be an ellipse, parabola or hyperbola in an appropriate affine plane) and joined by line segments in any order to form a hexagon, then the three pairs of opposite sides of the hexagon (extended if necessary) meet at three points which lie on a straight line, called the Pascal line of the hexagon. It is named after Blaise Pascal. The theorem is also valid in the Euclidean plane, but the statement needs to be adjusted to deal with the special cases when opposite sides are parallel.  Euclidean variants  The most natural setting for Pascal's theorem is in a projective plane since any two lines meet and no exceptions need to be made for parallel lines. However, the theorem remains valid in the Euclidean plane, with the correct interpretation of what happens when some opposite sides of the hexagon are parallel. If exactly one pair of opposite sides of the hexagon are parallel, then the conclusion of the theorem is that the \\"Pascal line\\" determined by the two points of intersection is parallel to the parallel sides of the hexagon. If two pairs of opposite sides are parallel, then all three pairs of opposite sides form pairs of parallel lines and there is no Pascal line in the Euclidean plane (in this case, the line at infinity of the extended Euclidean plane is the Pascal line of the hexagon).  Related results  This theorem is a generalization of Pappus's (hexagon) theorem ‚Äì Pappus's theorem is the special case of a degenerate conic of two lines. Pascal's theorem is the polar reciprocal and projective dual of Brianchon's theorem. It was formulated by Blaise Pascal in a note written in 1639 when he was 16 years old and published the following year as a broadside titled \\"Essay pour les coniques. Par B. P.\\", translation Pascal's theorem is a special case of the Cayley‚ÄìBacharach theorem. A degenerate case of Pascal's theorem (four points) is interesting; given points on a conic , the intersection of alternate sides, , , together with the intersection of tangents at opposite vertices and are collinear in four points; the tangents being degenerate 'sides', taken at two possible positions on the 'hexagon' and the corresponding Pascal line sharing either degenerate intersection. This can be proven independently using a property of pole-polar. If the conic is a circle, then another degenerate case says that for a triangle, the three points that appear as the intersection of a side line with the corresponding side line of the Gergonne triangle, are collinear. Six is the minimum number of points on a conic about which special statements can be made, as five points determine a conic. The converse is the Braikenridge‚ÄìMaclaurin theorem, named for 18th- century British mathematicians William Braikenridge and Colin Maclaurin , which states that if the three intersection points of the three pairs of lines through opposite sides of a hexagon lie on a line, then the six vertices of the hexagon lie on a conic; the conic may be degenerate, as in Pappus's theorem. The Braikenridge‚ÄìMaclaurin theorem may be applied in the Braikenridge‚ÄìMaclaurin construction, which is a synthetic construction of the conic defined by five points, by varying the sixth point. The theorem was generalized by August Ferdinand M√∂bius in 1847, as follows: suppose a polygon with sides is inscribed in a conic section, and opposite pairs of sides are extended until they meet in points. Then if of those points lie on a common line, the last point will be on that line, too. Hexagrammum Mysticum If six unordered points are given on a conic section, they can be connected into a hexagon in 60 different ways, resulting in 60 different instances of Pascal's theorem and 60 different Pascal lines. This configuration of 60 lines is called the Hexagrammum Mysticum. with a reference to Veblen and Young, Projective Geometry, vol. I, p. 138, Ex. 19. As Thomas Kirkman proved in 1849, these 60 lines can be associated with 60 points in such a way that each point is on three lines and each line contains three points. The 60 points formed in this way are now known as the Kirkman points. The Pascal lines also pass, three at a time, through 20 Steiner points. There are 20 Cayley lines which consist of a Steiner point and three Kirkman points. The Steiner points also lie, four at a time, on 15 Pl√ºcker lines. Furthermore, the 20 Cayley lines pass four at a time through 15 points known as the Salmon points. Proofs Pascal's original note has no proof, but there are various modern proofs of the theorem. It is sufficient to prove the theorem when the conic is a circle, because any (non-degenerate) conic can be reduced to a circle by a projective transformation. This was realised by Pascal, whose first lemma states the theorem for a circle. His second lemma states that what is true in one plane remains true upon projection to another plane. Degenerate conics follow by continuity (the theorem is true for non-degenerate conics, and thus holds in the limit of degenerate conic). A short elementary proof of Pascal's theorem in the case of a circle was found by , based on the proof in . This proof proves the theorem for circle and then generalizes it to conics. A short elementary computational proof in the case of the real projective plane was found by We can infer the proof from existence of isogonal conjugate too. If we are to show that , , are collinear for concyclic , then notice that and are similar, and that and will correspond to the isogonal conjugate if we overlap the similar triangles. This means that , hence making collinear. A short proof can be constructed using cross-ratio preservation. Projecting tetrad from onto line , we obtain tetrad , and projecting tetrad from onto line , we obtain tetrad . This therefore means that , where one of the points in the two tetrads overlap, hence meaning that other lines connecting the other three pairs must coincide to preserve cross ratio. Therefore, are collinear. Another proof for Pascal's theorem for a circle uses Menelaus' theorem repeatedly. Dandelin, the geometer who discovered the celebrated Dandelin spheres, came up with a beautiful proof using \\"3D lifting\\" technique that is analogous to the 3D proof of Desargues' theorem. The proof makes use of the property that for every conic section we can find a one-sheet hyperboloid which passes through the conic. There also exists a simple proof for Pascal's theorem for a circle using the law of sines and similarity. Proof using cubic curves Pascal's theorem has a short proof using the Cayley‚ÄìBacharach theorem that given any 8 points in general position, there is a unique ninth point such that all cubics through the first 8 also pass through the ninth point. In particular, if 2 general cubics intersect in 8 points then any other cubic through the same 8 points meets the ninth point of intersection of the first two cubics. Pascal's theorem follows by taking the 8 points as the 6 points on the hexagon and two of the points (say, and in the figure) on the would-be Pascal line, and the ninth point as the third point ( in the figure). The first two cubics are two sets of 3 lines through the 6 points on the hexagon (for instance, the set , and the set ), and the third cubic is the union of the conic and the line . Here the \\"ninth intersection\\" cannot lie on the conic by genericity, and hence it lies on . The Cayley‚ÄìBacharach theorem is also used to prove that the group operation on cubic elliptic curves is associative. The same group operation can be applied on a cone if we choose a point on the cone and a line in the plane. The sum of and is obtained by first finding the intersection point of line with , which is . Next and add up to the second intersection point of the cone with line , which is . Thus if is the second intersection point of the cone with line , then :(A + B) + C = D + C = Q = A + F = A + (B + C) Thus the group operation is associative. On the other hand, Pascal's theorem follows from the above associativity formula, and thus from the associativity of the group operation of elliptic curves by way of continuity. Proof using B√©zout's theorem Suppose is the cubic polynomial vanishing on the three lines through and is the cubic vanishing on the other three lines . Pick a generic point on the conic and choose so that the cubic vanishes on . Then is a cubic that has 7 points in common with the conic. But by B√©zout's theorem a cubic and a conic have at most 3 √ó 2 = 6 points in common, unless they have a common component. So the cubic has a component in common with the conic which must be the conic itself, so is the union of the conic and a line. It is now easy to check that this line is the Pascal line.  A Property of Pascal's Hexagon  Again given the hexagon on a conic of Pascal's theorem with the above notation for points (in the first figure), we have :\\\\frac{\\\\overline{GB}}{\\\\overline{GA}} \\\\times \\\\frac{\\\\overline{HA}}{\\\\overline{HF}} \\\\times \\\\frac{\\\\overline{KF}}{\\\\overline{KE}} \\\\times\\\\frac{\\\\overline{GE}}{\\\\overline{GD}} \\\\times \\\\frac{\\\\overline{HD}}{\\\\overline{HC}} \\\\times \\\\frac{\\\\overline{KC}}{\\\\overline{KB}}=1.  Degenerations of Pascals's theorem  Pascal's theorem: degenerations There exist 5-point, 4-point and 3-point degenerate cases of Pascal's theorem. In a degenerate case, two previously connected points of the figure will formally coincide and the connecting line becomes the tangent at the coalesced point. See the degenerate cases given in the added scheme and the external link on circle geometries. If one chooses suitable lines of the Pascal-figures as lines at infinity one gets many interesting figures on parabolas and hyperbolas.

Biography  Born as Rudolf Maximilian H√∂ll in Selmecb√°nya, Hont County, Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica, Slovakia), but later changed his surname to Hell. He was the third son from the second marriage of his father Matthias Cornelius Hell (Matth√§us Kornelius Hell) and his mother Julianna Staindl. The couple had a total of 22 children. Registry entries indicate that the family was of German descent, while Maximilian Hell later in life (ca. 1750) is known to declare himself as Hungarian. The place of birth of Maximilian's father is unknown; the settlements K√∂rm√∂cb√°nya (today Kremnica), Schlagenwald, (today Horn√≠ Slavkov) or Schlackenwerth (today Ostrov nad Oh≈ô√≠) are most frequently given. Born in a mixed German, Hungarian and Slovak town, he presumably knew Slovak to a certain extent and he probably understood Hungarian, but his mother tongue was German. Even so, Hell considered himself a Hungarian.\\"God God, who had believed that we will find brothers from the same ancient father in the Lapp people! Hungarians, our brethren, who speak our Hungarian language, wear our Hungarian clothes, live according to the customs of our Hungarian fathers, summing it up: our brethren.\\" Maximilian Hell's letter to Pater H√∂ller, written in Vard√∏, April 6, 1769. More letters from Hell at: (Hungarian) Hell with another Jesuit priest, J√°nos Sajnovics tried to explore the already widely discussed but insufficiently documented affinity between the language of the Sami, Finns and the Hungarians during and after their residency in Vard√∏. (Demonstratio idioma Ungarorum et Lapponum idem esse, 1770 Copenhagen) Title page of the Ephemerides Vindobonensem for 1781 Hell became the director of the Vienna Observatory in 1756. He published the astronomical tables Ephemerides astronomicae ad meridianum Vindobonemsem (\\"Ephemerides for the Meridian of Vienna\\"). He and his assistant J√°nos Sajnovics went to Vard√∏ in the far north of Norway (then part of Denmark-Norway) to observe the 1769 transit of Venus. He was elected as a foreign member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters on October 13, 1769. This society also funded the publication of his 1770 account of the Venus passage Observatio transitus Veneris ante discum Solis die 3. Junii anno 1769 (Copenhagen, 1770).Det Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskab 1742-1942 - Samlinger til Selskabets Historie, vol. 1, Copenhagen, 1942, p. 386. There was some controversy about Hell's observations of the transit of Venus because he stayed in Norway for eight months, collecting non-astronomical scientific data about the arctic regions for a planned encyclopedia (which never appeared, in part due to the suppression of the Jesuit order). The publication of his results was delayed, and some (notably Joseph Johann Littrow) accused Hell posthumously of falsifying his results. However, Simon Newcomb carefully studied Hell's notebooks and exonerated him a century after his death in Vienna. Besides astronomy, Hell also had an interest in magnet therapy (the alleged healing power of magnets), although it was Franz Anton Mesmer who went further with this and received most of the credit. In 1771, Hell was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. The crater Hell on the Moon is named after him.

The station is situated in the Millwall area and is in Travelcard Zone 2. The original station was on the route of the Millwall Extension Railway which was an old Victorian railway line that had been disused for many years. The original elevated station opened on 31 August 1987 and it was the last station before the terminus at Island Gardens. When the line was extended under the River Thames to Lewisham the station was rebuilt in a shallow cutting close to the tunnel entrance. The rebuilt station opened on 20 November 1999. In April 2008 work started on replacing the siding formed by the old route into a third platform for reversing trains and adding a canopy over the station. By October 2009 these works were complete. The station was originally intended to be named Millwall Park but around the time the DLR was being constructed Millwall F.C. had experienced some particularly nasty incidents of hooliganism, and a minority of its fans were considered to be amongst the most riotous in the country. Apart from any negative association the name may have given, local people were concerned that visiting fans in particular would travel to the station in error - not realising that the club's ground is some distance away on the other side of the river. Consequently, the name Mudchute was suggested and subsequently agreed upon. The name of the area refers to the engineering overspill when Millwall Dock was being created in the 1840s. Spoil from the excavation of the Dock and silt from its channels and waterways were dumped on nearby land, creating \\"The Mudchute\\", which quickly established itself as a wildlife habitat and adventuring location for local children.

Von Littrow is known for inventions in optics, including the Littrow prism, as well as the Littrow mount or Littrow configuration, which is a common way of orienting a blazed diffraction grating in a spectrometer or monochromator for high-throughput performance. Von Littrow is often associated with a proposal to dig a large circular canal in the Sahara desert and fill it with burning kerosene, thus communicating the fact of human intelligence to aliens who may be observing earth.

Originally composed by Governor Sir Cavendish Boyle in 1902 as a four-verse poem titled Newfoundland; it was sung by Frances Daisy Foster at the Casino Theatre of St. John's during the closing of the play Mamzelle on December 22nd, 1902. The original score was set to the music of E. R. Krippner, a German bandmaster living in St. John's but Boyle desired a more dignified score. It was then set to the music of British composer Sir Hubert Parry, a personal friend of Boyle, who composed two settings. On May 20th, 1904, the Ode was chosen as Newfoundland's official national anthem. This distinction was dropped when Newfoundland joined Canada in 1949. Three decades later, in 1980, the province re-adopted the song as an official provincial anthem, the first province to do so. The Ode is still sung at public events to this day as a tradition. Typically, only the first and last verses are sung.

Created by writer-artist Mike Grell, he debuted in 1st Issue Special #8 (Nov. 1975). The titular character, Travis Morgan, obtains the name \\"Warlord\\" as he fights for the freedom of the people of Skartaris. Publication history The character the Warlord debuted in 1st Issue Special #8 (cover-dated Nov. 1975). The decision to give the Warlord his own series had already been made by the time his 1st Issue Special debut went into production. He starred in The Warlord #1 (Feb. 1976), followed by an eight- month hiatus after issue #2, picking up again with #3 (Nov. 1976). The title lasted 133 issues until Winter 1988. Creator Mike Grell wrote and drew the comic for six years, handing over the art chores after issue #59 (July 1982); he continued writing the series through issue #71 (July 1983). \\"The last two years of Mike Grell's scripts were ghost-written by Sharon (Wright) Grell, as revealed in the letter column of a later issue.\\" Backup features A continuation of Jack Kirby's OMAC series, by Jim Starlin, was featured as a backup for several issues (#37‚Äì39 and #42‚Äì47). Arak, Son of Thunder, created by Roy Thomas and Ernie Col√≥n, first appeared in a special insert in The Warlord #48 (Aug. 1981). Claw the Unconquered appeared in a two‚Äìpart backup feature in issues #48‚Äì49 by Jack C. Harris and Thomas Yeates. \\"Dragonsword\\" was a backup feature by Paul Levitz and Yeates which appeared in #51‚Äì54 (Nov. 1981‚ÄìFeb. 1982). Arion, a sword and sorcery title by writer Paul Kupperberg and artist Jan Duursema, began as a six‚Äìpage backup feature in The Warlord #55 (March 1982). Another backup feature was \\"The Barren Earth\\" by writer Gary Cohn and artist Ron Randall, which was concluded in a four‚Äìissue limited series. A Bonus Book in issue #131 (Sept. 1988) featured artist Rob Liefeld's first work for DC. Volume 2 A six-issue miniseries ran cover-dated January to June 1992. It was written by Mike Grell and pencilled by Dameon Willich, with inks by Rick Hoberg (#1-3) and Tim Burgard (#4-6). Volume 3 DC attempted to update The Warlord in 2006 with Bruce Jones writing and Bart Sears providing the art. This series restarted the concept, beginning with Travis Morgan arriving in Skartaris. The series left a number of story points unanswered as issue #9 finished on a cliffhanger, while the tenth and final issue had a standalone story set sometime in the future. Volume 4 DC announced in July 2008 that The Warlord would return in an ongoing series written by Mike Grell in time for the original series' 35th anniversary. The series started in April 2009,Cowsill, Alan \\"2000s\\" in Dolan, p. 338 \\"Mike Grell was back at the helm for the return of DC's greatest sword-and-sorcery hero - Travis Morgan, the Warlord.\\" featuring art by Joe Prado and Chad Hardin. It ran for 16 issues. Fictional character biography Vietnam War veteran SR-71 pilot Travis Morgan passed through a hole in the Earth's crust while flying over the north pole in 1969 and landed in the underground world of Skartaris, a place strongly reminiscent of Edgar Rice Burroughs's Pellucidar. There Travis, wielding his .44 AutoMag pistol and joined by Shamballah's Princess (later Queen) Tara, a scantily dressed savage, became The Warlord and fought villains such as the evil sorcerer Deimos as well as various kings. He gained various sidekicks such as Machiste, Shakira, a Russian scientist named Mariah and his magic-wielding daughter Jennifer Morgan. In one story arc, Morgan even becomes the U.S. President in the far future. Although The Warlord has a superficial resemblance to the DC character Oliver Queen, he is in reality based more upon his creator Mike Grell who was a former member of the Air Force. Grell is caricatured in The Warlord's first appearance, 1st Issue Special #8 and is clearly sporting The Warlord's signature shaggy goatee. Grell and editor Jack C. Harris made a metafictional appearance in the story \\"Gambit\\" in The Warlord #35 (July 1980). Volume 4 of the series begins with an explorer finding perfectly preserved dinosaur remains in the Himalayas. She takes the head of one to a doctor and an expedition is set up to retrieve more samples. The team is spotted by the Chinese government and flee into the caves after losing several members. They discover a portal and after walking through find themselves in Skartaris where they encounter Travis Morgan. Travis Morgan is attacked by a giant bird and kills it with the help of Shakira. Refugees enter Shamballah and Morgan discovers that a new god has taken over the Shadow Kingdom and has overrun the Kingdom of Kiro, Machiste's homeland. One of the refugees is injured and he surprisingly carries a gunshot wound. The machinations of Deimos' return pit Travis Morgan against Tinder. Just as Morgan realizes that Tinder is in fact his son Joshua, he becomes distracted and Tinder mortally wounds him. Travis Morgan's final words were \\"I thought I'd have more time.\\" Morgan is cremated and Tinder becomes the new Warlord. Joshua Morgan becomes the new Warlord. His costume is reminiscent of Travis Morgan's black outfit when he first arrived in Skartaris. Instead of carrying a sword and a gun as Travis did, Tinder carries a sword, a dagger, a quiver of arrows and a bow. Other versions In the alternate timeline of the Flashpoint storyline, The Warlord is the pirate of a fleet when he was attacked by pirate Deathstroke in battle stealing their loot. During the battle, The Warlord's crew was killed while he escaped using the hovercraft. Later, The Warlord plans to attack Deathstroke and retrieve Jenny Blitz who has been in stasis since she was stolen from him. The Warlord ambushed Deathstroke and his fleet and demanded that they surrender. But in answer Deathstroke shot The Warlord's right eye using a scoped sniper rifle. He had been aiming for his mouth. Deathstroke fired at The Warlord's ship again, and it unexpectedly blew up. Each ship in Warlord's fleet subsequently exploded. The ships were destroyed by Jenny Blitz, now released from her stasis tube due to an earlier skirmish between Ocean Master and Icicle, one of Deathstroke's crewmen. Jenny appears to be able to project explosive force from her hands. In other media Television The Warlord appeared in the Justice League Unlimited episode \\"Chaos at the Earth's Core\\" voiced by Paul Guilfoyle. Green Lantern, Supergirl, Stargirl, and S.T.R.I.P.E. stumbled onto Skartaris and teamed up with him to stop Deimos and his unlikely allies Metallo and Silver Banshee of the Secret Society from stealing a huge piece of kryptonite rock. The Warlord dueled with Deimos, ending with Deimos plummeting down a ledge. Tara, Machiste, Mariah, Shakira, and Jennifer Morgan also appeared in this episode.

He lives together with his mother in Japan, while his father is a seafaring captain who travels around the world. Tsubasa is known as the Soccer no Moshigo which translates as \\"heaven-sent child of football\\". When he was only barely a year old, he was almost run over by a rushing bus while playing with a ball. However, Tsubasa held the ball in front of him which served as a cushion for most of the impact. The force of the bump blew him away, but he was able to right himself with the ball. Hence, Tsubasa's motto of \\"The ball is my friend\\". Ever since he was little, he always went out with a ball. His mother concludes that he was indeed born to only play football. At a very young age, Tsubasa already had amazing speed, stamina, dribbling skills and shotpower ‚Äì he astounded anyone who saw him play.

He meets Sanae Nakazawa (also known as Anego) an enthusiastic girl who also loves football and helps cheer the Nankatsu high school team on and Genzo Wakabayashi, a highly talented young goalkeeper whom he soon challenges to a game in Nankatsu's annual sports festival. He also meets Roberto Hongo, one of the best Brazilian footballers in the world who is a friend of Tsubasa's father and who starts living with Tsubasa and his mother in order to train Tsubasa. Roberto becomes a mentor to Tsubasa and helps him to harness his football skills, convincing him to join Nankatsu Elementary School and its fledgling elementary school football team, which Roberto later coaches as he passes his techniques onto Tsubasa. Tsubasa meets Taro Misaki, who has travelled around Japan due to his father's job and soon joins Nankatsu. The two become the best of friends on the pitch and real life, forming a partnership soon to be renowned as the \\"Golden Duo\\" or \\"dynamic duo\\" of Nankatsu.

Brancos in the anime), in Brazil's premier professional league, Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie A, winning the final against Flamengo (F.C. Domingos in the anime) 4‚Äì3. While in Brazil, Tsubasa gets to meet several talented Brazilian players, such as his teammate and roommate Pepe, who comes from a humble background, as well Flamengo star striker Carlos Santana, a prodigious yet emotionless talent. Enthusiastic football-loving youngster Shingo Aoi, whom Tsubasa once played against while in the high school national championships, leaves Japan to play football in Italy, where he hopes to play for a major Italian professional team. After arriving in Italy, however, Shingo gets tricked by a man who gives him fraudulent promises of getting him selected for an Italian team. After Shingo is taken to a badly furnished field, the man runs away, stealing all his money. Shingo realizes that he is swindled and tries hard to get his money back, doing such jobs as shoe-shining, until his enthusiastic attitude catches the eye of one of the coaches of Inter Milan (Intina in the anime), who sign him to play for their squad as an attacking midfielder.

Tsubasa scores the draw goal with a flying drive shot in the added time and the match ends 2‚Äì2. Production Author Y≈çichi Takahashi was inspired to write Captain Tsubasa after watching the 1978 FIFA World Cup. Yoichi Takahashi was delighted by association football after seeing the 1978 FIFA World Cup. The matches, players and fans' love towards the sport inspired him to write a manga about football. Another relevant aspect on this decision was the fact that Takahashi liked football more than baseball because he considered the players to have more freedom during matches. Despite football not being popular in Japan, Takahashi aimed to depict it through his manga and to reach the general public. Because of the non-popularity of the subject, getting the approval to write the manga by its publisher, Shueisha, took between 2 and 3 years, which was also difficult since it was his first manga. Rather than using professional players, the manga author instead used children as protagonists, hoping readers would identify themselves with the cast. Nevertheless, Takahashi already had in mind that through the series the main characters would grow up and become professionals. In the making of the cast, Takahashi designed multiple characters with different traits in order to deliver multiple traits that would serve as obstacles for Tsubasa to surpass. The large number of characters made Takahashi careful with their designs and he wanted to give each of them recognizable features. One of Tsubasa's early rivals, Jun Misugi, was given skills that surpassed the protagonist's. As a result, he gave Misugi a heart condition that would balance the match between their teams. When asked why Tsubasa's teams always win, Takahashi stated it was because he aims the manga to be long and thus a defeat would reduce its length. While the series was initially aimed at children, Takahashi was surprised at how, across the years, it has also attracted adults, as well as at the impact it had on Japan's football. When talking about its themes, Takahashi stated the main one is honor, which is meant to be superior than money, something which people value more. As Takahashi liked European football due to its competitive level, he decided to make Tsubasa leave S√£o Paulo and join Spain's F.C. Barcelona at the age of 21. In 1998, Takahashi traveled to Barcelona and enjoyed the Camp Nou stadium so much that he was inspired by it to make the Barcelona team Tsubasa's future team. Nevertheless, Takahashi asserted it was a decision taken at random and joked that Tsubasa would have joined the Real Madrid if he had visited Santiago Bernab√©u. For this part, Takahashi started using professional players inspired by real-life football stars, most notably Rivaul (inspired by Rivaldo) who would mentor Tsubasa in Barcelona. Due to Tsubasa's inexperience in his debut as an adult, Rivaul becomes his mentor. As of 2010, the manga had been translated into English, French, Italian, German, and Spanish. As of 2017, several volumes were available in an official Arabic translation and a third of the first print run of these were donated to Syrian refugee children by the publisher, Kinokuniya.

This first series adapts the first 25 volumes. Four animated movies followed soon after, between 1985 and 1986, continuing the storyline. In 1989 a new animation series, Shin Captain Tsubasa, was produced by Shueisha and CBS Sony Group, Inc. and spanned 13 original video animations (OVAs). Shin Captain Tsubasa adapts the manga from volume 25 to volume 36. The animation series was followed soon after into a second sequel, entitled Captain Tsubasa J, which was produced by NAS and Fuji Television and animated by Studio Comet. It aired between October 21, 1994 and December 22, 1995 in Japan on the Fuji TV network and spanned 47 episodes, as well an original video animation, Captain Tsubasa: Holland Youth, which was published in 1994. The animated series was continued on further into a third sequel, Captain Tsubasa: Road to Dream, also known as Captain Tsubasa ~ Road to 2002, animated by Group TAC, which aired in Japan by TV Tokyo between October 7, 2001 and October 6, 2002, with music published by Avex Mode.

Reception and legacy The manga series had a circulation of volumes within Japan as of 2008. In 2001, the Captain Tsubasa anime series was ranked forty- ninth in Animages \\"Top 100\\" anime productions list. The anime adaptation has also been very popular in Japan. In 2005, Japanese television network TV Asahi conducted a \\"Top 100\\" online web poll and nationwide survey: Captain Tsubasa placed forty-first in the online poll and thirtieth in the survey. In 2006, TV Asahi conducted another online poll for the top one hundred anime and Captain Tsubasa placed sixteenth on \\"The Celebrity List\\". The third television series was also highly popular in 2002, earning high ratings. Captain Tsubasa has inspired prominent footballers such as Hidetoshi Nakata, Alessandro Del Piero, Fernando Torres, Zinedine Zidane, Lionel Messi, Alexis S√°nchez and Andr√©s Iniesta to play football and choose it as a career. It also influenced Stephen Chow's film Shaolin Soccer (2001) and a line of Adidas running shoes. Manga group Clamp have also produced d≈çjinshi works related with the Captain Tsubasa characters. A bronze statue of Tsubasa Oozora was erected in the neighborhood of the anime's creator in Katsushika, Tokyo in spring 2013. Tsubasa and Misaki appeared in the video for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics at the closing ceremony for the 2016 Summer Olympics. Tsubasa and Misaki performed their twin shot in one scene and Tsubasa appeared on his own later with his signature overhead kick. In a match from Japan for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, the Japanese fans held a tifo featuring an illustration from the manga with multiple messages that supported the team. Nippon also made an article where they noted how Tsubasa became one of the most likeable fictional characters due to his dream and career in the series which at the same time influenced others. Espin Of noted one of the series' most notable features was how Tsubasa's skills allowed him to perform goals while his training with his teammates also generated appeal to the viewers. His passion for the football and initial relationship with goalkeeper Genzo Wakabayashi was also noted to be worthy notes. THEM Anime Reviews noted that Tsubasa obtained a highly international reputation but found the animation from the 1980s dated in the modern times. Additionally, he found Kojiro Hyuga's actions and his trainer's drinking problems might leave negative impressions on viewers. Nevertheless, they found the story appealing and wished it was licensed for an English release. PublishersWeekly.com highly praised the series, stating that its surprising length proves the success of the series. Additionally, the manga was noted not for only bringing style to football, but also likeable characters which were rightfully adapted in the anime series. In The Imperial Sportive: Sporting Lives in the Service of Modern Japan, Sandra Collins acknowledges Captain Tsubasa and Takehiko Inoue's Slam Dunk as mangas that helped to popularize football and basketball, respectively, in Japan during their serializations. Another series on which Captain Tsubasa exerted a great influence was Masaya Tsunamoto's Giant Killing. Similarly, Miho Koishihara referred to these two mangas as responsible for increasing the popularity of their respective sports with the writer noting that Captain Tsubasa focused on realistic growth in comparison to previous works. In Sport, literature, society : cultural historical studies noted the appeal of both the manga and its title character as one of the main reasons for becoming one of Japan's most popular soccer series referencing its popularity throughout its serialization. During the US occupation of Iraq, the Japan Self-Defense Force put Captain Tsubasa stickers on their water trucks. At the same time, the Japan Foundation provided an Arabic-dubbed season of Captain Tsubasa to the largest television station for free. In late 2018, the Katsushika City organized the \\"Captain Tsubasa Cup, Gotta Win!\\" campaign during the yearly Junior Soccer Tournament to help bring tourists to the city and keep young men active, and gave Takahashi the Honorary Citizen Award for the manga's positive impact on the city.

Initially developed in 1998, Firearms was created as a quasi-realistic team-based FPS. The mod's main feature is the large amount of usable weapons in the game. Gameplay In Firearms, players are divided into red and blue teams and are tasked with completing objectives. Objectives can vary from controlling areas to destroying objects. The main objective in all maps is to reduce the number of the opponent team's reinforcements to zero. Reinforcements determine the number of times players on a team can respawn. A team loses reinforcements when killed players respawn. The loss of reinforcements on a team can be stifled by completing map objectives and the direct and indirect actions of medics on the team. As long as a team has more than 0 reinforcements, players can respawn instantly. FireArms was the first FPS game to feature player-deployed parachutes. Unlike other games, players are free to choose what weapons they want to use. There are no classes (although players can choose predefined and editable weapon configurations) or a money system used to buy weapons. Instead, FireArms uses a credit system where every player can spend 30 credits to his or her liking. Every player receives a free knife regardless of the weapons configuration they choose. Players can spend their credits on weapons and equipment, ammunition is free and can be obtained from ammunition boxes available throughout most maps for when a player runs out. Players can buy skills by spending skill points. Every player starts out with 1 skill point and can earn another skill point for every 10 points they have. No more than 7 skill points can be obtained this way. The skill points can be used to buy skills which help the player. There are 7 different skills to choose from, 3 of which have a follow-up skill. Map objectives There are five map objectives: * CTI (Capture The Intelligence) ‚Äì Known in other games as Capture The Flag. Players have to pick up an object (usually a suitcase) and bring it to their designated capture area. The opposing team can shoot down the player carrying the object after which it will drop to the ground to be picked up by another player or left to respawn when it is not picked up for a certain amount of time. Once brought inside the team's capture area, the team receives reinforcements and/or point depending on the map. * PS (Push) ‚Äì Players have to control a series of areas (marked with flags) in a particular order to complete the map objective. On most maps, the areas are situated near both teams' spawn area and closer to the center on the map, usually counting between 3 and 5 control areas. Depending on the map, teams are rewarded with reinforcements for capturing an area which was neutral or controlled by the opposite team. Teams can also receive reinforcement penalties when the team does not control more than half of the control areas. When one team controls all the areas in the map, that team is rewarded with reinforcements and/or points. * SD (Search & Destroy) ‚Äì The map objective in sd maps is to destroy certain objects which are usually located near the opposing team's spawning area. Objects range from crates with ammunition and guns to trucks. Some objects can be destroyed by simply doing damage to it, while others have to be destroyed with a claymore mine. * TC (Territorial Control) Teams are rewarded with points and/or reinforcements when they control certain areas. Unlike the Push mode, players can capture any area regardless of which team controls the other areas. On some maps, players are awarded with points for every 30 seconds they control an area while on other maps, teams are rewarded with reinforcements every 30 seconds when every single area is controlled by that team. * OBJ (Objective) ‚Äì The last type of objective is a collective of objectives that don't fall under the other four types, or is a combination of different types of objectives. On most obj maps, players have to plant bombs in order to destroy certain map areas. The bombs can be defused within 30 seconds by the opposing team to prevent this. Development The final build is Release Candidate (RC) 3.0 which was released on April 18, 2005. FA was originally created by Caspar Milan Nielsen, Christian √òelund, and Brian Fuller.

The presupposition is a proposition that is presumed to be acceptable to the respondent when the question is asked. The respondent becomes committed to this proposition when he gives any direct answer. The presupposition is called \\"complex\\" because it is a conjunctive proposition, a disjunctive proposition, or a conditional proposition. It could also be another type of proposition that contains some logical connective in a way that makes it have several parts that are component propositions. Complex questions can but do not have to be fallacious, as in being an informal fallacy. Implication by question One form of misleading discourse involves presupposing and implying something without stating it explicitly, by phrasing it as a question. For example, the question \\"Does Mr. Jones have a brother in the army?\\" does not claim that he does, but implies that there must be at least some indication that he does, or the question would not need to be asked. The person asking the question is thus protected from accusations of making false claims, but still manages to make the implication in the form of a hidden compound question. The fallacy is not in the question itself, but rather in the listener's assumption that the question would not have been asked without some evidence to support the supposition. In order to have the desired effect, the question must imply something uncommon enough not to be asked without some evidence to the fact. For example, the question \\"Does Mr. Jones have a brother?\\" would not cause the listener to think there must be some evidence that he does, since this form of general question is frequently asked with no foreknowledge of the answer. Complex question fallacy The complex question fallacy, or many questions fallacy, is context dependent; a presupposition by itself doesn't have to be a fallacy. It is committed when someone asks a question that presupposes something that has not been proven or accepted by all the people involved.Michel Meyer, Questions and questioning, Walter de Gruyter, 1988, , Google Print, p. 198‚Äì199Douglas N. Walton, Fundamentals of critical argumentation, Cambridge University Press, 2006, , Google Print, p. 194‚Äì196Douglas N. Walton, Informal logic: a handbook for critical argumentation, Cambridge University Press, 1989, , Google Print, p. 36‚Äì37Douglas N. Walton. Witness testimony evidence: argumentation, artificial intelligence, and law, Cambridge University Press, 2008, , Google Print, p. 329 For example, \\"Is Mary wearing a blue or a red dress?\\" is fallacious because it artificially restricts the possible responses to a blue or red dress. If the person being questioned wouldn't necessarily consent to those constraints, the question is fallacious. Hence we can distinguish between: * legitimately complex question (not a fallacy): A question that assumes something that the hearer would readily agree to. For example, \\"Who is the monarch of the United Kingdom?\\" assumes that there is a place called the United Kingdom and that it has a monarch, both true. * illegitimately complex question: On the other hand, \\"Who is the King of France?\\" would commit the complex question fallacy because while it assumes there is a place called France (true), it also assumes France currently has a king (false). But since answering this question does not seem to incriminate or otherwise embarrass the speaker, it is complex but not really a loaded question. When a complex question contains controversial presuppositions (often with loaded language‚Äîhaving an unspoken and often emotive implication), it is known as a loaded question. For example, a classic loaded question, containing incriminating assumptions that the questioned persons seem to admit to if they answer the questions instead of challenging them, is \\"Have you stopped beating your wife?\\" If the person questioned answers, \\"Yes\\", then that implies that he has previously beaten his wife. A loaded question may be asked to trick the respondent into admitting something that the questioner believes to be true, and which may in fact be true. So the previous question is \\"loaded\\", whether or not the respondent has actually beaten his wife‚Äìand if the respondent answers anything other than \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" in an attempt to deny having beaten his wife, the questioner can accuse him of \\"trying to dodge the question\\". The very same question may be loaded in one context, but not in the other. For example, the previous question would not be loaded were it asked during a trial in which the defendant has already admitted having beaten his wife. Similar questions and fallacies A similar fallacy is the double-barreled question. It is committed when someone asks a question that touches upon more than one issue, yet allows only for one answer.Response bias . SuperSurvey, Ipathia Inc.Earl R.

UCPO is a non-audition orchestra. Membership is aimed primarily at members of the University of Cambridge, although the orchestra usually counts among its members a significant number of other residents of Cambridge. Only conductors and soloists are auditioned. The orchestra usually performs five concerts in each year. Three of these feature the full orchestra. A further two are performed by a smaller group officially known as the 'University of Cambridge Philharmonia', informally known as 'Baby'. 2015/16 repertoire included selections from Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker Suite danced by representatives of Cambridge University Ballet Club (as part of UCPO's inaugural 'Gala Concert'), Strauss' Fledermaus Overture, Elgar's 'Cello Concerto in E minor, Beethoven's Symphony No. 4 and Dvorak's Violin Concerto. Previous repertoire is just as varied, and has included Brahms, Sibelius, Bizet, Shostakovich and Haydn. History UCPO was founded in the early 1990s as the West Cambridge Symphony Orchestra, WCSO. The orchestra was started as an offshoot of Fitzwilliam College Music Society (FCMS), which provided grants to help fund the early years. Members were taken principally from Fitzwilliam, Churchill and New Hall colleges. In 1995, the orchestra broke its ties with Fitz and expanded, rehearsing in Peterhouse and taking musicians from any college. The original role of WCSO is now filled by The Orchestra on the Hill. In the early years following the split from Fitz, WCSO was organised in a relatively informal way, regularly making a loss that was recouped each year by combining the Easter concert with a garden party and 'giving away' drinks to those guests who 'bought raffle tickets'. Each treasurer had to cover losses personally. This situation started to resolve from 1998 onwards, with the creation of a specific orchestral bank account and a greater emphasis on publicity. After this, WCSO started to grow and change in character, with an increasingly formal committee structure, more ambitious programmes, and an increasing sense of professionalism. Rehearsals outgrew most college rehearsal rooms, and the Wesley Methodist Church was chosen as a venue from 1999. Throughout, the orchestra remained committed to the principle of having no auditions, and accepting anyone for whom there was a musical part. An increasingly large membership brought new musical opportunities, but also new limits in which pieces could be attempted. Sectional pieces were introduced in an attempt to give everyone a chance to play, before the decision was made to start a chamber orchestra to increase the possible range. The West Cambridge Sinfonia, or 'Baby' as it quickly became known, has grown rapidly since its introduction. In 2001, the orchestra moved to a new home at Selwyn College, rehearsing in the Selwyn Diamond. At the start of 2002, and after a lively debate at the AGM, the decision was made to change the name of the orchestra to UCPO. The principal argument was that the orchestra was no longer tied to West Cambridge physically. UCPO's ties with Cambridge colleges ended in 2007, apart from the current rehearsal space for the Philharmonia, Queens' College, and some concert venues. Since October 2007, the main orchestra has rehearsed at St Giles' Church.

Young, a Republican, served as the 33rd Governor of Ohio from March 2, 1877 to January 14, 1878. Early life Young was born in Killyleagh, County Down, in Ulster, the northern province in Ireland. At that time, all of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. While living in Ireland, his father was a gardener for The 2nd Baron Dufferin and Claneboye.Clarke 1889, p. 198 He immigrated with his parents to the United States as a child and spent his childhood in New York. Military career Young enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1848, originally joining as a musician. He advanced through the ranks of the artillery to become a First Sergeant in the 3rd U.S. Artillery, serving under Brevet Major John F. Reynolds. After his service ended in January 1858, Young moved to Pennsylvania, then to Cincinnati a year later, where he served as the Assistant Superintendent for the House of Refuge Reform School for Youth.Reid 1895, p. 988 In March 1861 Young, believing a civil war to be imminent, wrote to General Winfield Scott volunteering his services. He officially joined the American Civil War effort a month later. Between August and December, he served under John C. Fr√©mont as a captain while stationed in Missouri. The unit disbanded at the beginning of 1862, and Young left the service. He worked for a Democratic Party newspaper in Sidney, Ohio afterwards, and spoke out against the Lincoln Administration, believing them to be too soft in the war effort thus far. Young re-enlisted and received a commission as major in the 118th Ohio Infantry in September 1862, where he remained for the duration of his service. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel in February 1863 and the rank of colonel in April 1864. At the Battle of Resaca in May, Young led a charge against the enemy that was quickly defeated; the charge caused him to lose 116 of his 270 men in the span of a few minutes. He contracted an illness during the Atlanta Campaign, and resigned from the Army in September. President Abraham Lincoln brevetted him Brigadier-General of volunteers for his service on March 13, 1865.Reid 1895, p. 989 Political career After resigning, Young returned to Cincinnati and graduated from the Cincinnati Law School in 1865. Shortly afterward, he began his political career with an appointment as Assistant City Auditor, a position he held for the rest of the year. He was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives afterward, and served a single two-year term from 1866 to 1868. Young became Hamilton County Recorder in October 1867, and held the position until President Andrew Johnson named him Internal Revenue Supervisor of Southern Ohio in late 1868, a position he held through 1869. After resigning from that position, Young worked in real estate until 1871 when he was elected to the Ohio State Senate. At that point he was considered highly regarded in the Republican Party, and when elected to the State Senate, he had more votes than most other Republicans on the statewide ballot.Clarke 1889, p. 200 Young was elected the 12th Lieutenant Governor of Ohio in 1875, defeating Samuel Cary, taking office in 1876. He then filled out the term of Rutherford B. Hayes when the latter was elected to the presidency, serving from 1877 to 1878. Later life Young was then elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1878 and served two terms before losing a battle for renomination in 1882. He died in 1888 while holding a position on the Cincinnati Board of Public Affairs. Young was buried in Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati.

Ultraviolet divergences are dealt with by renormalization.

Background Minna was born in Pofi, Italy, and moved to Canada with her family at the age of 9. They settled in Toronto, Ontario in the Christie Pits area. Her father worked in the construction industry and her mother laboured as a factory worker. She is the third eldest of five children, having three sisters and a brother. She attended a vocational high school earning a diploma and started working as a secretary. At age 24 she attended the University of Toronto where she graduated with an Honours B.A. in Sociology. At age 34, she married Robert MacBain, a public relations consultant. From 1981 to 1992, she served as the volunteer president of COSTI-IIAS, Canada's largest immigrant services organization. She also served as president of the National Congress of Italian-Canadians. Due in part to her high profile, Minna was appointed to serve on two task forces with the Worker's Compensation Board. In 1986 she co- chaired the Task Force on Vocational Rehabilitation and in 1991 she chaired a Task Force on Service Delivery. Both led to significant improvements in the operation of the WCB. Politics Minna sought the Liberal nomination for the riding of York West in 1984. She lost to Sergio Marchi. She also tried to get nominated in the riding of York North in 1988 but lost to Maurizio Bevilacqua. The York North nomination fight turned ugly amidst claims of delegate stacking and improper procedures. Minna later appealed the nomination but withdrew the complaint claiming that the appeal process was tainted. In government She was elected to parliament in the 1993 election in which the Liberal party won all but one of the 99 Ontario seats. Although the former Liberal candidate ran against her as an independent, she defeated New Democratic Party (NDP) incumbent Neil Young by a margin of two-to-one, thus becoming the first Liberal in history to represent the Beaches area south of the Danforth. As of 2008 she has been re-elected five times easily defeating high-profile candidates such as Peter Tabuns (2004 election, by 7,738 votes) and Marilyn Churley (2006 election, by 2,778 votes; 2008 election, by 4035 votes). On August 3, 1999, Minna was appointed to Cabinet as the Minister of International Cooperation. She held the post until the beginning of 2002. On December 11, 2001, Minna was accused of improperly voting in a municipal by- election. She voted for friend and colleague Gail Nyberg who was running to replace Michael Prue who had been elected to the Provincial government in a September by-election. On advice from municipal officials, Minna cast a ballot even though she didn't live within the ward which occupies the northern half of her riding. According to municipal election rules, anyone who owns or rents a business is allowed to vote. Minna's constituency office was in the ward so that allowed her to cast a ballot. Soon after, Minna was dropped from Cabinet during a ministerial shuffle. Minna was bitter about the demotion and complained to the Liberal Party's women's caucus that she was told to keep quiet about the issue. She claimed she was \\"hung out to dry by ambitious individuals....\\" Later she conceded that the PMO's office had told her that it would be better to wait for the results of the ethics investigation. Initially the ethics counsellor terminated the allegations probe since she was dropped from Cabinet but Minna insisted that it be reopened. She said, \\"It's my personal credibility that's at stake. It's not the cabinet post.\\" Fellow Liberal MP Sheila Copps who sympathized with Minna's situation was quoted as saying, \\"The one thing you have in politics is your reputation.\\" The probe was reopened and she was subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing. During her time in government, Minna has held several leadership roles that have focused on immigration and international relations. In 1994 she was appointed Vice-Chair of the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development and served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration from 1996 to 1998. In October 2004, Minna was appointed special adviser to the Minister of Foreign Affairs on issues of women, peace and security. In March 2005, Minna led a five-person Parliamentary delegation to assist with the peace process in Sri Lanka. In opposition From 2006 to January 2009 Minna was the Official Opposition Critic for the Status of Women. Minna was the Official Opposition Critic for Labour. On May 2, 2011 during the 41st federal election Minna lost her seat to NDP candidate Matthew Kellway. Awards Minna has received several awards recognizing her involvement with the immigrant community. These include the Indo-Canada Chamber of Commerce President's Award (2001), the Permio Italia nel Mondo award for individuals of Italian origin (2001), Results Canada's Outstanding Leadership Award (2002), and the Canada-Sri Lanka Business Council's President's Award (2006).

The Horizontal Everest: Extreme Journeys on Ellesmere Island. BPS Books, 2010 is an island in Canada and the largest uninhabited island in the world. It is located in Baffin Bay, Qikiqtaaluk Region, Nunavut, Canada. It is one of the largest members of the Arctic Archipelago, the second-largest of the Queen Elizabeth Islands, Canada's sixth-largest island, and the 27th-largest island in the world. It has an area of (slightly smaller than Croatia). The bedrock is Precambrian gneiss and Paleozoic siltstones and shales. The highest point is the Devon Ice Cap at which is part of the Arctic Cordillera. Devon Island contains several small mountain ranges, such as the Treuter Mountains, Haddington Range and the Cunningham Mountains. The notable similarity of its surface to that of Mars has attracted interest from scientists. History and settlement Patterned ground permafrost pattern seen on Devon Island Robert Bylot and William Baffin were the first Europeans to sight the island in 1616. William Edward Parry charted its south coast in 1819‚Äì20, and named it North Devon, after Devon in England, a name which was changed to Devon Island by the end of the 1800s. In 1850, Edwin De Haven sailed up Wellington Channel and sighted the Grinnell Peninsula. An outpost was established at Dundas Harbour in 1924, and it was leased to Hudson's Bay Company nine years later. The collapse of fur prices led to the dispersal of 53 Baffin Island Inuit families on the island in 1934. It was considered a disaster due to wind conditions and the much colder climate, and the Inuit chose to leave in 1936. Dundas Harbour was populated again in the late 1940s, but it was closed again in 1951. Only the ruins of a few buildings remain. Geography Topography of Devon Island Satellite photo montage of Devon Island and its neighbours Because of its relatively high elevation and its extreme northern latitude, it supports only a meagre population of muskox and small birds and mammals; the island does support hypolith communities. Animal life is concentrated in the Truelove Lowland area of the island, which has a favourable microclimate and supports relatively lush Arctic vegetation. Temperatures during the brief (40 to 55 days) growing season seldom exceed , and in winter can plunge to as low as . With a polar desert ecology, Devon Island receives very little precipitation. Cape Liddon is an Important Bird Area (IBA) notable for its black guillemot and northern fulmar populations. Cape Vera, another IBA site, is also noted for its northern fulmar population. Devon Island is also notable for the presence of the Haughton impact crater, created some 39 million years ago when a meteorite about in diameter crashed into what were then forests. The impact left a crater about in diameter, which was a lake for several million years. Scientific research Devon Island Research Station The Devon Island Research Station was established in 1960 and it is maintained by the Arctic Institute of North America. It is located in Truelove Lowland, on the northeast coast of Devon Island ().Truelove Lowland summary and pictures Flashline Mars The Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station project entered its third season in 2004. In July 2004, Devon Island became the temporary home for five scientists and two journalists, who were to use the Mars-like environment to simulate living and working on that planet. April 2007 through 21 August 2007 was the longest simulation period and included 20 scientific studies. The Haughton crater is now considered one of the world's best Mars analog sites. It is the summer home to NASA's complementary scientific program, the Haughton‚ÄìMars Project. HMP has conducted geological, hydrological, botanical, and microbiological studies in this harsh environment since 1997. HMP-2008 was the twelfth field season at Devon Island. In 2007, fossils of the seal ancestor Puijila darwini were found on the island. On July 16, 2013, the Canadian Space Agency assigned Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen to a secondment with the Centre for Planetary Science and Exploration of the University of Western Ontario at Haughton Crater in preparation for a potential future manned exploration of Mars, the Moon or the asteroids.

The former logo of Bank Mandiri, used until January 2008. Bank Mandiri is the result of the merger made by Indonesian government from four older government-owned banks that failed in 1998. Those four banks were Bank Bumi Daya (BBD), Bank Dagang Negara (BDN), Bank Expor Impor (Exim), and Bank Pembangunan Indonesia (Bapindo). During the amalgamation and reorganisation, the government reduced the number of branches by 194 and the number of personnel from 26,600 to 17,620. *1951: Bank Industri Negara (BIN) was established to finance priority sectors, such as plantations, industry and mining. *1959: The Indonesia government nationalised Nationale Handelsbank's operations in Indonesia and from them created Bank Umum Negara. *1960: The Indonesia government nationalised the Indonesian operations of two more Dutch banks. It used Nederlandsche Handel- Maatschappij's operations to create Bank Ekspor Impor Indonesia. Escomptobank became Bank Dagang Negara. The government also established the state-owned Bank Pembangunan Indonesia (Bapindo) and merged BIN into it. Bapindo specialised in medium and long-term financing of manufacturing, tourism and transportation. *1964: The Indonesia government nationalised Chartered Bank's operations in Indonesia and merged them into Bank Umum Negara.

Noyes served as the 30th Governor of Ohio. Biography Noyes was born in Haverhill, Massachusetts. He was orphaned at the age of three and was raised in New Hampshire by his grandfather and a guardian. At the age of thirteen, he was apprenticed to the printer of The Morning Star, a religious newspaper published in Dover, New Hampshire. He remained an apprentice for over four years until he left to enter an academy in Kingston, New Hampshire. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1857 (4th in a class of 57 students), then moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, and attended the Cincinnati Law School. Noyes served in the Union Army during the Civil War. He helped organize the 39th Ohio Infantry, and was rewarded with a commission as its first major on July 27, 1861. Within a few months, he had become the regiment's colonel. Noyes married Margaret W. Proctor at Kingston, New Hampshire in February, 1863, while on leave from the army. He was severely wounded in his ankle in a skirmish at Ruff's Mill on July 4, 1864, during the Atlanta Campaign and, as a result, had his left leg amputated. Three months later, Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker assigned Noyes, who was still recuperating and using crutches, to the command of Camp Dennison near Cincinnati, breveted him as a brigadier general. Noyes commanded the post until April 22, 1865, when he resigned to become city solicitor. He was elected in October 1866 as the probate judge of Hamilton County. He was elected to the governorship in 1871, besting another former Union Army officer, Col. George W. McCook, by more than twenty thousand votes. He served one two-year term between 1872‚Äì74, pushing for stricter coal mine inspection laws and promoting fish conservation. He lost re-election in 1873 by 817 votes, 50.1% - 49.9%. In 1874, he was appointed an Ohio Commissioner of the Centennial Exposition in PhiladelphiaGilkey 1901 : 770 He later served as Rutherford B. Hayes's Minister to France from 1877‚Äì81, a patronage reward for his strong support of his fellow Buckeye soldier during Hayes' presidential campaign.

It is typically used for a semiclassical calculation in quantum mechanics in which the wavefunction is recast as an exponential function, semiclassically expanded, and then either the amplitude or the phase is taken to be changing slowly. The name is an initialism for Wentzel‚ÄìKramers‚ÄìBrillouin. It is also known as the LG or Liouville‚ÄìGreen method. Other often-used letter combinations include JWKB and WKBJ, where the \\"J\\" stands for Jeffreys.  Brief history  This method is named after physicists Gregor Wentzel, Hendrik Anthony Kramers, and L√©on Brillouin, who all developed it in 1926. In 1923, mathematician Harold Jeffreys had developed a general method of approximating solutions to linear, second-order differential equations, a class that includes the Schr√∂dinger equation. The Schr√∂dinger equation itself was not developed until two years later, and Wentzel, Kramers, and Brillouin were apparently unaware of this earlier work, so Jeffreys is often neglected credit. Early texts in quantum mechanics contain any number of combinations of their initials, including WBK, BWK, WKBJ, JWKB and BWKJ. An authoritative discussion and critical survey has been given by Robert B. Dingle.Robert Balson Dingle, Asymptotic Expansions: Their Derivation and Interpretation (Academic Press, 1973). Earlier appearances of essentially equivalent methods are: Francesco Carlini in 1817, Joseph Liouville in 1837, George Green in 1837, Lord Rayleigh in 1912 and Richard Gans in 1915. Liouville and Green may be said to have founded the method in 1837, and it is also commonly referred to as the Liouville‚ÄìGreen or LG method. The important contribution of Jeffreys, Wentzel, Kramers, and Brillouin to the method was the inclusion of the treatment of turning points, connecting the evanescent and oscillatory solutions at either side of the turning point. For example, this may occur in the Schr√∂dinger equation, due to a potential energy hill. WKB method Generally, WKB theory is a method for approximating the solution of a differential equation whose highest derivative is multiplied by a small parameter . The method of approximation is as follows. For a differential equation : \\\\varepsilon \\\\frac{d^ny}{dx^n} + a(x)\\\\frac{d^{n-1}y}{dx^{n-1}} + \\\\cdots + k(x)\\\\frac{dy}{dx} + m(x)y= 0, assume a solution of the form of an asymptotic series expansion : y(x) \\\\sim \\\\exp\\\\left[\\\\frac{1}{\\\\delta}\\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty}\\\\delta^nS_n(x)\\\\right] in the limit . The asymptotic scaling of in terms of will be determined by the equation ‚Äì see the example below. Substituting the above ansatz into the differential equation and cancelling out the exponential terms allows one to solve for an arbitrary number of terms in the expansion. WKB theory is a special case of multiple scale analysis. An example This example comes from the text of Carl M. Bender and Steven Orszag. Consider the second-order homogeneous linear differential equation : \\\\epsilon^2 \\\\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} = Q(x) y, where Q(x) eq 0. Substituting :y(x) = \\\\exp\\\\left[\\\\frac{1}{\\\\delta}\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\delta^nS_n(x)\\\\right] results in the equation :\\\\epsilon^2\\\\left[\\\\frac{1}{\\\\delta^2}\\\\left(\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\delta^nS_n'\\\\right)^2 + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\delta}\\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty}\\\\delta^nS_n\\\\right] = Q(x). To leading order (assuming, for the moment, the series will be asymptotically consistent), the above can be approximated as :\\\\frac{\\\\epsilon^2}{\\\\delta^2}S_0'^2 + \\\\frac{2\\\\epsilon^2}{\\\\delta}S_0'S_1' + \\\\frac{\\\\epsilon^2}{\\\\delta}S_0 = Q(x). In the limit , the dominant balance is given by :\\\\frac{\\\\epsilon^2}{\\\\delta^2}S_0'^2 \\\\sim Q(x). So is proportional to Œµ. Setting them equal and comparing powers yields :\\\\epsilon^0: \\\\quad S_0'^2 = Q(x), which can be recognized as the Eikonal equation, with solution :S_0(x) = \\\\pm \\\\int_{x_0}^x \\\\sqrt{Q(t)}\\\\,dt. Considering first-order powers of fixes :\\\\epsilon^1: \\\\quad 2S_0'S_1' + S_0 = 0. This is the unidimensional transport equation, having the solution :S_1(x) = -\\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\ln Q(x) + k_1, where is an arbitrary constant. We now have a pair of approximations to the system (a pair, because can take two signs); the first-order WKB-approximation will be a linear combination of the two: :y(x) \\\\approx c_1Q^{-\\\\frac{1}{4}}(x)\\\\exp\\\\left[\\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon}\\\\int_{x_0}^x\\\\sqrt{Q(t)}\\\\,dt\\\\right] + c_2Q^{-\\\\frac{1}{4}}(x)\\\\exp\\\\left[-\\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon}\\\\int_{x_0}^x\\\\sqrt{Q(t)}\\\\,dt\\\\right]. Higher-order terms can be obtained by looking at equations for higher powers of . Explicitly, : 2S_0'S_n' + S_{n-1} + \\\\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}S'_jS'_{n-j} = 0 for ‚â• 2.  Precision of the asymptotic series  The asymptotic series for is usually a divergent series, whose general term starts to increase after a certain value . Therefore, the smallest error achieved by the WKB method is at best of the order of the last included term. For the equation : \\\\epsilon^2 \\\\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} = Q(x) y, with <0 an analytic function, the value n_\\\\max and the magnitude of the last term can be estimated as follows: :n_\\\\max \\\\approx 2\\\\epsilon^{-1} \\\\left \\\\int_{x_0}^{x_{\\\\ast}} \\\\sqrt{-Q(z)}\\\\,dz \\\\right , :\\\\delta^{n_\\\\max}S_{n_\\\\max}(x_0) \\\\approx \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{n_\\\\max}} \\\\exp[-n_\\\\max], where x_0 is the point at which y(x_0) needs to be evaluated and x_{\\\\ast} is the (complex) turning point where Q(x_{\\\\ast})=0, closest to x=x_0. The number can be interpreted as the number of oscillations between x_0 and the closest turning point. If \\\\epsilon^{-1}Q(x) is a slowly changing function, :\\\\epsilon\\\\left \\\\frac{dQ}{dx} \\\\right \\\\ll Q^2 , the number will be large, and the minimum error of the asymptotic series will be exponentially small. Application to the Schr√∂dinger equation WKB approximation to the indicated potential. Vertical lines show the turning points Probability density for the approximate wave function. Vertical lines show the turning points The above example may be applied specifically to the one-dimensional, time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation, :-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m} \\\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \\\\Psi(x) + V(x) \\\\Psi(x) = E \\\\Psi(x), which can be rewritten as :\\\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \\\\Psi(x) = \\\\frac{2m}{\\\\hbar^2} \\\\left( V(x) - E \\\\right) \\\\Psi(x). Approximation away from the turning points The wavefunction can be rewritten as the exponential of another function (which is closely related to the action), which could be complex, :\\\\Psi(x) = e^{\\\\Phi(x)}, so that :\\\\Phi(x) + \\\\left[\\\\Phi'(x)\\\\right]^2 = \\\\frac{2m}{\\\\hbar^2} \\\\left( V(x) - E \\\\right), where ' indicates the derivative of with respect to x. This derivative ' can be separated into real and imaginary parts by introducing the real functions A and B, :\\\\Phi'(x) = A(x) + i B(x). The amplitude of the wavefunction is then :\\\\exp\\\\left[\\\\int_{x_0}^x A(x')\\\\,dx'\\\\right], while the phase is :\\\\int_{x_0}^x B(x')\\\\,dx'. The real and imaginary parts of the Schr√∂dinger equation then become :A'(x) + A(x)^2 - B(x)^2 = \\\\frac{2m}{\\\\hbar^2} \\\\left( V(x) - E \\\\right), :B'(x) + 2 A(x) B(x) = 0. Next, the semiclassical approximation is used. This means that each function is expanded as a power series in . From the above equations, it can be seen that the power series must start with at least an order of 1/ to satisfy the real part of the equation. In order to achieve a good classical limit, it is necessary to start with as high a power of Planck's constant as possible: :A(x) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\hbar} \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\hbar^n A_n(x), :B(x) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\hbar} \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\hbar^n B_n(x). To the zeroth order in this expansion, the conditions on A and B can be written, :A_0(x)^2 - B_0(x)^2 = 2m \\\\left( V(x) - E \\\\right), :A_0(x) B_0(x) = 0 \\\\;. The first derivatives and were discarded, because they include factors of order 1/, higher than the dominant ‚àí2. Then, if the amplitude varies sufficiently slowly as compared to the phase (A_0(x) = 0), it follows that :B_0(x) = \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{ 2m \\\\left( E - V(x) \\\\right) }, which is only valid when the total energy is greater than the potential energy, as is always the case in classical motion. After the same procedure on the next order of the expansion, it follows that :\\\\Psi(x) \\\\approx C_0 \\\\frac{ e^{\\\\theta + i \\\\int \\\\hbar^{-1}\\\\sqrt{2m \\\\left( E - V(x) \\\\right)}\\\\,dx} }{\\\\hbar^{-1/2}\\\\sqrt[4]{2m \\\\left( E - V(x) \\\\right)}}. On the other hand, if it is the phase that varies slowly (as compared to the amplitude), (B_0(x) = 0) then :A_0(x) = \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{ 2m \\\\left( V(x) - E \\\\right) }, which is only valid when the potential energy is greater than the total energy (the regime in which quantum tunneling occurs). Finding the next order of the expansion yields, as in the example of the previous section, Section 15.4 {\\\\hbar^{-1/2}\\\\sqrt[4]{2m \\\\left( V(x) - E \\\\right)}}. cellpadding= 6 border border colour = #0073CF bgcolor=#F9FFF7}} In the classically allowed region, namely the region where V(x) the integrand in the exponent is imaginary and the approximate wave function is oscillatory. In the classically forbidden region V(x)>E, the solutions are growing or decaying. It is evident in the denominator that both of these approximate solutions become singular near the classical turning points, where , and cannot be valid. (The turning points are the points where the classical particle changes direction.) Behavior near the turning points We now consider the behavior of the wave function near the turning points. For this, we need a different method. Near the first turning points, 1, the term \\\\frac{2m}{\\\\hbar^2}\\\\left(V(x)-E\\\\right) can be expanded in a power series, :\\\\frac{2m}{\\\\hbar^2}\\\\left(V(x)-E\\\\right) = U_1 \\\\cdot (x - x_1) + U_2 \\\\cdot (x - x_1)^2 + \\\\cdots\\\\;. To first order, one finds :\\\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \\\\Psi(x) = U_1 \\\\cdot (x - x_1) \\\\cdot \\\\Psi(x). This differential equation is known as the Airy equation, and the solution may be written in terms of Airy functions, Section 15.5 :\\\\Psi(x) = C_A \\\\textrm{Ai}\\\\left( \\\\sqrt[3]{U_1} \\\\cdot (x - x_1) \\\\right) + C_B \\\\textrm{Bi}\\\\left( \\\\sqrt[3]{U_1} \\\\cdot (x - x_1) \\\\right). Although for any fixed value of \\\\hbar, the wave function is bounded near the turning points, the wave function will be peaked there, as can be seen in the images above. As \\\\hbar gets smaller, the height of the wave function at the turning points grows. The matching conditions It now remains to construct a global (approximate) solution to the Schr√∂dinger equation. For the wave function to be square-integrable, we must take only the exponentially decaying solution in the two classically forbidden regions. These must then \\"connect\\" properly through the turning points to the classically allowed region. For most values of E, this matching procedure will not work: The function obtained by connecting the solution near +\\\\infty to the classically allowed region will not agree with the function obtained by connecting the solution near -\\\\infty to the classically allowed region. The requirement that the two functions agree imposes a condition on the energy E, which will give an approximation to the exact quantum energy levels. Given the two coefficients on one side of the classical turning point, the 2 coefficients on the other side of the classical turning point can be determined by using the Airy function to connect them. Thus, a relationship between C_0,\\\\theta and C_{+},C_{-} can be found. This relationship is obtained using known asymptotic of the Airy function. The relationship can be found to be as follows (often referred to as the \\"connection formulas\\"): Claim 15.7 : C_{+} = + \\\\frac{1}{2} C_0 \\\\cos{\\\\left(\\\\theta - \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}\\\\right)}, : C_{-} = - \\\\frac{1}{2} C_0 \\\\sin{\\\\left(\\\\theta - \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}\\\\right)}. Now the global (approximate) solutions can be constructed. The same can be done at the other turning points; assume there is just another one, 2. The expression there, however, will appear different than the one determined above at 1 by a difference in the argument of these trigonometric functions. The matching condition, needed to get a single-valued, square-integrable approximate solution, takes the following form: ::\\\\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \\\\sqrt{2m \\\\left( E-V(x)\\\\right)}\\\\,dx = (n+1/2)\\\\pi \\\\hbar , where x_1,x_2 are the turning points of the potential discussed, where the integrand vanishes. Here n is a non-negative integer. This condition can also be rewritten as saying that ::The area enclosed by the classical energy curve is 2\\\\pi\\\\hbar(n+1/2). Either way, the condition on the energy is a version of the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition, with a \\"Maslov correction\\" equal to 1/2. Section 15.2 It is possible to show that after piecing together the approximations in the various regions, one obtains a good approximation to the actual eigenfunction. In particular, the Maslov- corrected Bohr-Sommerfeld energies are good approximations to the actual eigenvalues of the Schr√∂dinger operator. Theorem 15.8 Specifically, the error in the energies is small compared to the typical spacing of the quantum energy levels. Thus, although the \\"old quantum theory\\" of Bohr and Sommerfeld was ultimately replaced by the Schr√∂dinger equation, some vestige of that theory remains, as an approximation to the eigenvalues of the appropriate Schr√∂dinger operator. The probability density One can then compute the probability density associated to the approximate wave function. The probability that the quantum particle will be found in the classically forbidden region is small. In the classically allowed region, meanwhile, the probability the quantum particle will be found in a given interval is approximately the fraction of time the classical particle spends in that interval over one period of motion. Conclusion 15.5 Since the classical particle's velocity goes to zero at the turning points, it spends more time near the turning points than in other classically allowed regions. This observation accounts for the peak in the wave function (and its probability density) near the turning points.

Mastering  A master is the definitive recording version that will be replicated for the end user, commonly into other formats (i.e. LP records, CDs, DVDs etc). A batch of copies is often made from a single original master recording, which might itself be based on previous recordings. For example, sound effects (a door opening, punching sounds, falling down the stairs, a bell ringing, etc.) might have been added from copies of sound effect tapes similar to modern sampling to make a radio play for broadcast. Problematically, several different levels of masters often exist for any one audio release. As an example, examine the way a typical music album from the 1960s was created. Musicians and vocalists were recorded on multi-track tape. This tape was mixed to create a stereo or mono master. A further master tape would likely be created from this original master recording consisting of equalization and other adjustments and improvements to the audio to make it sound better on record players for example. More master recordings would be duplicated from the equalized master for regional copying purposes (for example to send to several pressing plants). Pressing masters for vinyl recordings would be created. Often these interim recordings were referred to as Mother Tapes. All vinyl records would derive from one of the master recordings. Thus, mastering refers to the process of creating a master. This might be as simple as copying a tape for further duplication purposes, or might include the actual equalization and processing steps used to fine-tune material for release. The latter example usually requires the work of mastering engineers. With the advent of digital recording in the late 1970s, many mastering ideas changed. Previously, creating new masters meant incurring an analogue generational loss; in other words, copying a tape to a tape meant reducing the signal-to-noise ratio. This means how much of the original intended \\"good\\" information is recorded against faults added to the recording as a result of the technical limitations of the equipment used (noise, e.g. tape hiss, static, etc.). Although noise reduction techniques exist, they also increase other audio distortions such as azimuth shift, wow and flutter, print-through and stereo image shift. With digital recording, masters could be created and duplicated without incurring the usual generational loss. As CDs were a digital format, digital masters created from original analog recordings became a necessity.  Remastering  Remastering is the process of making a new master for an album, film, or any other creation. It tends to refer to the process of porting a recording from an analogue medium to a digital one, but this is not always the case. For example, a vinyl LP ‚Äì originally pressed from a worn-out pressing master many tape generations removed from the \\"original\\" master recording ‚Äì could be remastered and re-pressed from a better-condition tape. All CDs created from analogue sources are technically digitally remastered. The process of creating a digital transfer of an analogue tape remasters the material in the digital domain, even if no equalization, compression, or other processing is done to the material. Ideally, because of their higher resolution, a CD or DVD (or even higher quality like high- resolution audio or hi-def video) release should come from the best source possible, with the most care taken during its transfer. Additionally, the earliest days of the CD era found digital technology in its infancy, which sometimes resulted in poor-sounding digital transfers. The early DVD era was not much different, with copies of films frequently being produced from worn prints, with low bitrates and muffled audio. When the first CD remasters turned out to be bestsellers, companies soon realized that new editions of back-catalogue items could compete with new releases as a source of revenue. Back-catalogue values skyrocketed, and today it is not unusual to see expanded and remastered editions of relatively modern albums. Master tapes, or something close to them, can be used to make CD releases. Better processing choices can be used. Better prints can be utilized, with sound elements remixed to 5.1 surround sound and obvious print flaws digitally corrected. The modern era gives publishers almost unlimited ways to touch up, doctor, and \\"improve\\" their media, and as each release promises improved sound, video, extras and others, producers hope these upgrades will entice people into making a purchase.  Music  Remastering music for CD or even digital distribution first starts from locating the original analog version. The next step involves digitising the track or tracks so it can be edited using a computer. Then the track order is chosen. This is something engineers often worry about because if the track order is not right, it may seem sonically unbalanced. When the remastering starts, engineers use software tools such as a limiter, an equaliser, and a compressor. The compressor and limiters are ways of controlling the loudness of a track. However, this is not to be confused with the volume of a track, which is controlled by the listener during playback. The dynamic range of an audio track is measured by calculating the variation between the loudest and the quietest part of a track. In recording studios the loudness is measured with negative decibels, zero designating the loudest record-able sound. A limiter works by having a certain cap on the loudest parts and if that cap is exceeded, it is automatically lowered by a ratio preset by the engineer. = Criticism = Remastered audio has been the subject of criticism. Many remastered CDs from the late 1990s onwards have been affected by the \\"loudness war\\", where the average volume of the recording is increased and dynamic range is compressed at the expense of clarity, making the remastered version sound louder at regular listening volume and more distorted than an uncompressed version. Some have also criticized the overuse of noise reduction in the remastering process, as it affects not only the noise, but the signal too, and can leave audible artifacts.Interview with Steve Wilson in Preston 53 Degrees venue, date 20/4/07. Equalisation can change the character of a recording noticeably. As EQ decisions are a matter of taste to some degree, they are often the subject of criticism. Mastering engineers such as Steve Hoffman have noted that using flat EQ on a mastering allows listeners to adjust the EQ on their equipment to their own preference, but mastering a release with a certain EQ means that it may not be possible to get a recording to sound right on high- end equipment. Additionally, from an artistic point of view, original mastering involved the original artist, remastering often does not. Therefore, many times remasters result in a totally changed character to the music.  Film and television  The Big Boss: original footage on the left; remastered footage on the right To remaster a movie digitally for DVD and Blu-ray, digital restoration operators must scan in the film frame by frame at a resolution of at least 2,048 pixels across (referred to as 2K resolution). Some films are scanned at 4K, 6K, or even 8K resolution to be ready for higher resolution devices. Scanning a film at 4K‚Äîa resolution of 4096 √ó 3092 for a full frame of film‚Äîgenerates at least 12 terabytes of data before any editing is done. Digital restoration operators then use specialist software such as MTI's Digital Restoration System (DRS) to remove scratches and dust from damaged film. Restoring the film to its original color is also included in this process. As well as remastering the video aspect, the audio is also remastered using such software as Pro Tools to remove background noise and boost dialogue volumes so when actors are speaking they are easier to understand and hear. Audio effects are also added or enhanced, as well as surround sound, which allows the soundtrack elements to be spread among multiple speakers for a more immersive experience. An example of a restored film is the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. The color portions of Oz were shot in the three-strip Technicolor process, which in the 1930s yielded three black and white negatives created from red, green and blue light filters which were used to print the cyan, magenta and yellow portions of the final printed color film answer print. These three negatives were scanned individually into a computer system, where the digital images were tinted and combined using proprietary software. The cyan, magenta, and yellow records had suffered from shrinkage over the decades, and the software used in the restoration morphed all three records into the correct alignment. The software was also used to remove dust and scratches from the film by copying data, for example, from the cyan and yellow records to fix a blemish in the magenta record. Restoring the movie made it possible to see precise visual details not visible on earlier home releases: for example, when the Scarecrow says \\"I have a brain\\", burlap is noticeable on his cheeks. It was also not possible to see a rivet between the Tin Man's eyes prior to the restoration. Shows that were shot and edited entirely on film, such as Star Trek: The Original Series, cannot be released in high definition without being re-scanned from the original film recordings. Certain special effects were also updated to appear better in high-definition. Shows that were made between the early '80s and the early 2000s were generally shot on film, then transferred to cassette tape, and then edited natively in either NTSC or PAL, making high-definition transfers literally impossible as the standard definition resolution was baked into the final cuts of the episodes. Star Trek: The Next Generation is the only such show that has received a Blu-Ray release. The process of making high-definition versions of TNG episodes required finding the original film clips, re-scanning them into a computer at high definition, digitally re-editing the episodes from the ground up, and re-rendering new visual effects shots, an extraordinarily labor- intensive ordeal that cost Paramount over $12 million. The project was a financial failure and resulted in Paramount deciding very firmly against giving Deep Space Nine and Voyager the same treatment. = Criticism = Remastered movies have been the subject of criticism. When the Arnold Schwarzenegger film Predator was remastered, it was felt that the process was overdone, resulting in Schwarzenegger's skin looking waxy. As well as complaints about the way the picture looks, there have been other complaints about digital fixing. One notable complaint is from the 2002 remastered version of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), where director Steven Spielberg replaced guns in the hands of police and federal agents with walkie talkies. A later 30th anniversary edition released in 2012 saw the return of the original scene. Canadian animator John Kricfalusi (of The Ren & Stimpy Show fame) has become a prominent critic of digital remastering, particularly in regards to its effects on Western animation. In his blog \\"John K. Stuff,\\" he has admonished remasters for over-saturating colors and sharpening lines to the point of color bleeding (among other criticisms). He has gone on record in his blog to describe remastering as \\"digital ruination\\" and \\"digital destruction.\\"  Video games  A comparison of Halo: Combat Evolved (left) and Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary (right) with redrawn graphics. Anniversary features both the old and the new visuals in-game with a graphics-swapping feature. Remastering a video game is more difficult than remastering a film or music recording because the video game's graphics show their age. This can be due to a number of factors, notably lower resolutions and less complicated rendering engines at the time of release. Modern computer monitors and high-definition televisions tend to have higher display resolutions and different aspect ratios than the monitors/televisions available when the video game was released. Because of this, classic games that are remastered typically have their graphics re-rendered at higher resolutions. An example of a game that has had its original graphics re-rendered at higher resolutions is Hitman HD Trilogy, which contains two games with high resolution graphics: Hitman 2: Silent Assassin and Hitman: Contracts. Both were originally released on PC, PlayStation 2, and Xbox. The original resolution was 480p on Xbox, while the remastered resolution is displayed at 720p on Xbox 360. There is some debate regarding whether graphics of an older game at higher resolutions make a video game look better or worse than the original artwork, with comparisons made to colorizing black-and-white-movies. More significant than low resolution is the age of the original game engine and simplicity of the original 3D models. Older computers and video game consoles had limited 3D rendering speed, which required simple 3D object geometry such as human hands without individual fingers but instead modeled like a mitten, and the world having a distinctly chunky appearance with no smoothly curving surfaces. Older computers also had less texture memory for 3D environments, requiring low resolution bitmap images that look visibly pixelated or blurry when viewed at high resolution. (Some early 3D games such as the 1993 version of DOOM also just used an animated two-dimensional image that is rotated to always face the player character, rather than attempt to render highly complex scenery objects or enemies in full 3D.) As a result, depending on the age of the original game, it is often necessary to remake or remodel the graphical assets as the originals may not be compatible with the new technology for a remaster. An example of a game that has had its graphics redesigned is Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary, while the core character and level information is exactly the same as in Halo: Combat Evolved.

The band is currently composed of two of its founding members, vocalist Kurt Brecht and guitarist Spike Cassidy, as well as drummer Rob Rampy and bass player Greg Orr. D.R.I. never gained a mainstream audience, but the integration of their hardcore punk roots with thrash metal influences was a stylistic catalyst for their contemporaries ‚Äî most notably Suicidal Tendencies, Corrosion of Conformity, Stormtroopers of Death, the Cro-Mags, Nuclear Assault and Cryptic Slaughter ‚Äî alongside whom they are considered to be one of the major pioneers of what would later be called \\"crossover thrash\\", along with Adrenalin O.D., with both bands having a heavy influence on modern thrash metal. To date, D.R.I. has released seven full-length studio albums. Other than three new songs on the 2016 EP But Wait...There's More!, they have not released a full- length studio album since Full Speed Ahead in 1995. Despite this, the band has continued to tour almost every year, and gone on hiatus intermittently, notably between 2004 and 2009, when Cassidy was diagnosed with colon cancer. Since at least 1998, D.R.I. has been working on their eighth full-length studio album, which remains unreleased. History Early days (1982‚Äì1986) The Dirty Rotten Imbeciles formed on May 2, 1982 in the city of Houston, from the ashes of the hardcore punk band Suburbanites. The original line-up consisted of Spike Cassidy on guitar, Kurt Brecht on vocals, Eric Brecht on drums and Dennis Johnson on bass guitar, which was basically the Suburbanites with Cassidy on guitar. Cassidy's roommate played guitar in the Suburbanites. The group started practicing at Kurt and Eric's parents' home. The noise made by the band allegedly drew regular complaints from Kurt and Eric's father. This led to the band gaining their name when they were described as a \\"bunch of dirty rotten imbeciles.\\" This was also an inspiration for the song \\"Madman,\\" which featured a clip of Kurt and Eric's father interrupting a band practice to complain about the noise. They initially went under the name U.S.D.R.I for a brief period of time before shortening it to D.R.I. Presumably, the \\"U.S.\\" stood for the band, as mentioned in interviews off of the extended version on the Dirty Rotten CD. Photos of the band can be found with the original U.S.D.R.I logo. The \\"Skanker Man\\" logo was designed by original drummer Eric Brecht as a high school art assignment to create a \\"corporate\\" logo. He received an \\"A\\" on it. Two months later, on July 2, 1982, the band played their first show at Joe Star's OMNI, in Houston. On November 6 & 7, 1982, D.R.I. recorded their first release, the Dirty Rotten EP, fitting 22 songs into 18 minutes on a 7\\" EP. Only 1000 copies of this EP version were pressed, making it now a very rare collector's item. Demand caused this EP to be pressed into a 12\\" LP version, released in 1983, aptly titled Dirty Rotten LP. In 1983, D.R.I. relocated to San Francisco, where they lived in their van and ate at soup kitchens in between gigs. Dennis Johnson quit the band and returned home to Texas. He was replaced with Sebastion Amok, and within a few months D.R.I. found themselves on the \\"Rock Against Reagan\\" tour with the Dead Kennedys. At the conclusion of the tour, Josh Pappe was brought in to replace Sebastian Amok who would eventually join The Dicks, another Texas band. Their next release was the 4 song 7\\" EP Violent Pacification in 1984. After touring in the summer of 1984, Eric Brecht got married and left the band. He was replaced with at the time, a 17-year-old Felix Griffin. Also in 1984, one of their songs, \\"Snap\\" appeared on the anti-war benefit compilation P.E.A.C.E. along with other famous hardcore and punk bands such as Crass, D.O.A., Dead Kennedys and MDC. D.R.I.'s second full-length album, Dealing with It!, was released in March 1985. The group toured extensively in support of the album. During the recording of the album, Josh took a leave from the band. Mikey Offender (Mikey Donaldson - bass player of The Offenders) was asked to play for the album, although Spike played bass on the songs that Mikey didn't have time to learn. The songs on Dealing With It leaned slightly towards a metal direction, but still kept the band's thrashcore sound. On April 26, 1986, they recorded their show at the Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles and released the video, which was entitled Live at the Olympic. Crossover thrash period (1987‚Äì1996) When Felix joined D.R.I. in 1984 he brought a new audience to the shows. The next three years the band toured and started developing a new genre, (along with other pioneers) crossover. Their third album, Crossover, released in 1987, was suitingly named since the songs on this album had a strong metal sound to them. As the band began to \\"crossover\\" to thrash, their songs became longer, slower, and more complex. The press has called D.R.I. the major band of the \\"crossover\\" movement, a style that combined hardcore punk and thrash metal. This music invited a mixed audience of punks, skinheads, and metal fans to their shows. The Live At The Ritz video was recorded next, on June 27, 1987, at The Ritz in New York, during the band's worldwide Crossover tour. In February 1988, the Dirty Rotten Imbeciles returned to the studio to record 4 of a Kind. The songs on this album continued in the band's metal style. They released a music video for the song \\"Suit and Tie Guy\\", and the Dirty Rotten LP was remixed to include the songs from the Violent Pacification EP, and was re-released. The band toured Europe again to support the 4 of a Kind album, then once home in the U.S., Josh Pappe left the band because of an offer to play for Gang Green. He was replaced by John Menor. September 1989 brought the release of Thrash Zone. Two music videos were released from this album, \\"Beneath the Wheel\\" and \\"Abduction\\". In 1990, Felix Griffin left the group and was replaced by Rob Rampy. During early 1992, Definition was released on Rotten Records. A music video was released for the song \\"Acid Rain\\". The video would later be featured in an episode of MTV's Beavis and Butthead. D.R.I. toured in 1992, opening for Testament, as well as headlining their own shows. During this tour, they recorded their gig at the Hollywood Palladium on November 27. It was released in 1994 as their first live album, appropriately entitled Live. It was, more or less, \\"released as a stepping stone between Definition and Full Speed Ahead\\". Soon after recording the show, John Menor left D.R.I. and was replaced by the band's long time friend and roadie, Chumly Porter. The group took part in headlining the Lolitabazooka Tour, in the fall of 1994. In 1995, D.R.I. released Full Speed Ahead. They also made another music video, this time for a song called \\"Syringes In The Sandbox\\". In January 1996, they started touring North America with Acid Bath opening for them. But in April, Rob and Spike ran into some trouble trying to enter Canada because they had both been previously charged with driving under the influence in the U.S. This resulted in the cancellation of all their Canadian tour dates. Touring (1997‚Äì2005) During 1997 and 1998, D.R.I. continued to tour the world extensively, including European & South American dates. In March 1998, D.R.I. launched their official web site. Also in 1998, D.R.I. announced that they were writing songs for the follow-up to Full Speed Ahead, including \\"Against Me\\", \\"As Seen on TV\\", \\"Bad News\\", \\"Brick Wall View\\", \\"Destructive Power\\", \\"Insanity Plea\\", \\"Saddam Insane\\", \\"Sweaty Deli Tray\\" and \\"Wrong as Usual\\"; the former of the two would be released 18 years later on But Wait...There's More!. Relentless touring, as well as the band's slow writing and recording pace and the search for a record label, resulted in putting the album on hold for over half a decade; eventually they were signed to Beer City Records. By the spring of 2004, D.R.I. had demoed at least four new songs for their eighth studio album, including \\"Against Me\\", which was available downloading at the \\"record news\\" page from their official web site for several years. As of January 2019, the album has yet to be released. During 1999, D.R.I. appeared as one of the headlining bands on the \\"Social Chaos\\" in North America Tour. One of their songs, \\"I'm The Liar\\", is used for a Social Chaos Tour CD compilation. The CD contained one song from each band that appeared on the tour. During August 1999, in the middle of the tour, Chumly left the band after tiring of touring. He was replaced by Harald Oimoen. Oimoen had been working on and off with the band for years, doing everything from photography and merchandise to bass tech. The band resumed the tour missing only two shows. The turn of the millennium saw the Dirty Rotten Imbeciles headline the \\"Millennium 2000 Tour\\". The constant cycle of touring continued into 2001 with D.R.I. extensively touring the US on the \\"Old School Tour‚Äù culminating in a headlining appearance at the Milwaukee Metal Fest. 2002 marks D.R.I.'s 20th anniversary and the beginning of a new era for the band. D.R.I. signed with Beer City records agreeing to reissue their back catalog and a produce new studio CDs and DVDs. To celebrate both of these occasions, DRI embarked on a huge world tour. This tour went all over the US, Japan, Europe and South America into 2003. The first Beer City reissue came out in 2003. The Dirty Rotten CD featured the original full length Dirty Rotten LP and the Violent Pacification 7‚Äù EP as well as a number of never before released bonus tracks and interviews. Included within the bonus tracks were live recordings of D.R.I.‚Äôs first show ever and live computer video footage from the band's only performance at New York's famous CBGB‚Äôs from the 1984 \\"Violent Pacification\\" tour. 2003 also brought the second Beer City reissue for Dealing With It. This CD contains the original album plus rare and never before heard bonus tracks as well as live video footage. The footage is from a mid 80‚Äôs interview from a San Francisco Public-access television cable TV show. D.R.I. embarked on yet another tour in 2004 that would take them all over the US and all over Europe again. After completing the tour, they decided it was time to start working with Beer City on the Live At CBGB‚Äôs CD and DVD and the reissue of the Crossover album. The Live At CBGB‚Äôs DVD and CD was reissued and is available on Beer City Records. The reissue of Crossover was delayed due to Spike's illness. Hiatus, recovery of Spike Cassidy and continued touring (2006‚Äì2013) In March 2006, Spike was diagnosed with colon cancer, putting the band's current tour and future performances on hiatus until his recovery. Plans to release a new studio LP are also on hold until Spike has recovered. In December 2006, Spike had completed all radiation and chemotherapy after being diagnosed with cancer in March 2006. A one-foot section of large intestine (colon) was removed through an eight-inch (20 cm) incision in his stomach. The surgery, which took place on March 27, 2006 was said to be successful in removing all traces of the cancer. His rehabilitation is going well and he is expected to make a full recovery. The official website states Cassidy to be cancer free as of August 2008. Spike Cassidy commented on his return to the stage ‚ÄúI am very happy D.R.I. will be playing again, it has been far too long. We are currently setting up weekends to test the water and rebuild the stamina that we were known for. We all look forward to restarting up exactly where we left off.\\" D.R.I. is known for their high energy performances and their nonstop touring. Cassidy also adds ‚ÄúRight now it is 2 & 3 day weekends until 2010, followed by some international work. We really are planning to be able to do a 4 week tour by late summer 2010.\\" April 13, 2010 Beer City records reissued Crossover - Millennium Edition on LP and CD. Finally after many years Crossover was once again available. This reissue was remastered by the original co-producer/engineer Bill Metoyer. This release also contains liner notes by all the band members who played on this release (Spike Cassidy, Kurt Brecht, Felix Griffin and Josh Pappe). The CD version also contains 11 bonus tracks including 5 songs from their famous performance at NYC 'The Ritz'. June 15, 2010 Beer City records reissues The Dirty Rotten EP, The Dirty Rotten LP, Violent Pacification 7\\" and Dealing With It on vinyl. All of these releases had been out of print on vinyl now for a very long time. The LP's were issued on red vinyl and both 7\\"s were issued on 5 colors of vinyl. In 2011, D.R.I. went on a tour of the US, the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands, Italy and Germany. But Wait...There's More!, lineup changes and new album (2014‚Äìpresent) D.R.I. entered a Southern California studio in October 2014 to begin record an EP containing new material. It was produced by Bill Metoyer, who produced the band's third, fourth and fifth studio albums Crossover, 4 of a Kind and Thrash Zone. Vocalist Kurt Brecht has described the EP as \\"more punk rock than metal\\". The EP, titled But Wait...There's More!, was released on June 10, 2016, and the band embarked on a series of world tours in support of it. On September 17, 2014, it was announced that Rob Rampy had departed from the band, citing serious injury as the reason. He was then replaced by Brandon Karns, who subsequently left the band shortly thereafter. Karns was then replaced by Walter \\"Monsta\\" Ryan. However, Rampy re-joined D.R.I in 2018. In 2017, the band parted ways with their longtime bassist Harald Oimoen, who was replaced by Greg Orr (ex Attitude Adjustment). In January 2019, Metal Addicts reported that D.R.I. had been working on their first full-length studio album since 1995's Full Speed Ahead, tentatively planned for release later that year or in 2020. Copyright infringement Although no longer working with D.R.I., one of the band's old record labels, Rotten Records, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Rotten Records is suing a Comcast user who allegedly downloaded and shared their sixth album. According to the lawsuit, Rotten Records hired Rightscorp to monitor BitTorrent networks for infringement. The company claims it connected to the defendants‚Äô BitTorrent clients and downloaded a full copy of the album, later verifying that they were identical to the original copyright works. ‚ÄúRightscorp sent Defendant 288 notices via their ISP Comcast Cable Communications, Inc. from December 14, 2014 to May 12, 2015 demanding that Defendant stop illegally distributing Plaintiff‚Äôs work. Defendant ignored each and every notice and continued to illegally distribute Plaintiff‚Äôs work,‚Äù the complaint reads. Rotten Records demands an injunction forbidding further online infringement in both cases in addition to the deletion of both albums from each Comcast user‚Äôs computer. The record label also wants statutory damages (potentially $150K per work if any infringement is deemed willful) plus attorneys‚Äô fees. Style and influence D.R.I.'s music has combined elements of punk rock, thrash metal, speed metal and heavy metal, while their early material has been described as hardcore punk. They are often cited as one of the key bands that helped create the crossover thrash genre, along with S.O.D., Suicidal Tendencies and Corrosion of Conformity. Allmusic.com has claimed that, \\"Starting off as a speedy, straight-ahead punk band, they gradually mixed more elements of heavy metal into their sound; as they did so, their songs got longer and featured more sections and more variety in tempo. D.R.I. managed the then-rare feat of crossing over to metal audiences while retaining their skate-punk and hardcore fan bases -- they had something for all those audiences to love (or hate).\\" Many bands and artists have cited D.R.I. as an influence or inspiration, including Anthrax, Cryptic Slaughter, Dark Angel, Death Angel, Kreator, Municipal Waste, Nuclear Assault, Slayer and Vio-Lence.

He served briefly as the 27th Governor of Ohio. Biography Anderson was born in Louisville, Kentucky, to a prominent family; his father, Richard Clough Anderson Sr., was an aide to the Marquis de Lafayette during the American Revolution. Anderson graduated from Miami University in 1833, studied law and was admitted to the Ohio bar. He moved to Dayton, Ohio, where he began a law practice and was later elected county prosecutor. Career In 1844, Anderson was elected to the Ohio Senate and made a name for himself as an advocate for black rights. He then moved to Texas for health reasons. He gave an impassioned speech in San Antonio in December 1860, strongly opposing secession and calling for the \\"perpetuity of the national Union.\\" Angry local pro-Confederates threatened Anderson and arrested him without charge, but Anderson escaped and returned with his family to Dayton. President Abraham Lincoln sent Anderson on a pro-Union speaking tour of Europe, after which Anderson accepted command of the 93rd Ohio Infantry and was commissioned in the Union Army as a colonel. Badly wounded at the Battle of Stones River, Anderson resigned his commission and returned to Ohio to recuperate. Anderson was elected the seventh Lieutenant Governor of Ohio in late 1863 and took office the following year. On August 29, 1865, he became governor upon the death of Governor John Brough. Anderson served less than five months, until January 8, 1866. Ohio historian Dwight L. Smith wrote that his brief term in office was \\"uneventful... [and] the services he performed were merely routine.\\" Death After leaving the governorship, Anderson resumed his legal practice and moved back to Kentucky, where he died at the age of 81. Anderson is interred at Kuttawa Cemetery in Kuttawa, Kentucky. Family life Anderson's brother, Major Robert Anderson, was also a United States Army officer, notable for his defense of Fort Sumter at the outset of the American Civil War. Another brother, William Marshall Anderson, was a noted explorer, politician, and briefly a member of the New Virginia Colony of ex-Confederates in Mexico during the reign of Emperor Maximilian.See Huntington Library papers: http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt98700720&doc.view;=entire_text&brand;=oac (Note: Rev.

It was opened in 1892. The Women's College is one of two all-female residential colleges at The University of Sydney. It accommodates approximately 280 students accepting both under- and post-graduate students. It also has approximately 30 non- resident students (affiliates). The Principal, Vice-Principal and Dean of Students live on the premises. The college's buildings were added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 April 2005. History The Women's College at the University of Sydney In 1889 a college for women within the University of Sydney was established and endowed by an Act of the NSW Parliament. This was the culmination of a process that began in 1887 when, six years after the formal admission of women to the University of Sydney \\"in complete equality with men\\", a public meeting was held to discuss the desirability of establishing a residential college for women. Over the course of the next five years, funds were raised enabling the college to open in March 1892 in temporary accommodation in \\"Strathmore\\", a rented house in Glebe. It had four resident and four non-resident (or affiliate) students.The Women's College Main BuildingGranted land by the University on the southern edge of campus, the college moved to its own building in May 1894. Designed by the architectural firm of Sulman & Power, the College's first permanent home still forms the heart of the present building complex and is heritage listed. The 1887 meeting resolved that the college not be attached to a religious denomination, and that the Colleges' Endowment Act of 1854, which provided for the establishment of the denominational men's colleges, should be subject to the provision that \\"no religious catechism or formulary distinctive of any particular denomination\\" should be taught, nor would any attempt be made to attach students to any particular denomination. The College was to be \\"undenominational\\". The other elements of the college's role, envisaged in 1887, were to provide \\"domestic supervision\\" and \\"efficient assistance in preparing for university lectures and examinations\\". These ideals continue to guide the College in the 21st century. The Women's College now accommodates 260 women undergraduates and 20 postgraduates. It maintains its tradition of being at the forefront of women's education and social theory and championing women's rights, academic thought and leadership. In the 127 years since its foundation in 1892 more than 7,000 students have been members of the College.  Buildings and campus  In 1894 the Main Building opened with accommodation for 26 students. Designed by Sulman & Power it cost ¬£10,056, a substantial amount of money for the time. In 1916 the College expanded, building \\"The Cottage\\" for an extra 6 students. To meet the demand for places after the First World War, \\"The Maples\\", a house at the rear of the property was rented and then, in 1919 purchased. Additional student rooms were added in 1924, the back balconies of Main Building closed in, and the Louisa Macdonald Commemoration Dining Hall built. The next major expansion of College began in 1936, with the construction of the new Williams wing. Named in honour of Susie Jane Williams, the immediate past Principal (1919‚Äì1934), it was officially opened by Lady Wakehurst on 6 July 1937, and provided accommodation to 85 students. Further growth in demand after the Second World War led to the building in 1958 of the Reid wing, and further additions to Williams. Designed by Ellice Nosworthy, and supported by a donation given by Mary Reid, it originally provided accommodation for approximately 40 students. The third major expansion of College took place between 1965 and 1969, with the building of the Langley wing and Menzies Common Room, as well as extensions to the Dining Hall, bringing capacity of College to 280 students. The project was designed by Fowell Mansfield & Maclurcan and funded partially by grants from the Australian Universities Commission. In the mid-1990s the Vere Hole Research Centre and Library was added under the Reid wing, funded by two bequests and an fundraising drive. In 1999‚Äì2000 the Main Building was restored with a grant from the Centenary of Federation Fund.  Academic and support programmes  Women's College operates a range of programmes designed to encourage students to maximise their academic potential.  College Tutorials  Throughout both semesters the College runs tutorials in more than thirty subjects, spanning the full range of academic disciplines. Most tutors are senior students, postgraduates or University staff with expertise in their fields and proven teaching skills.  Academic assistants  Academic Assistants are postgraduates and senior undergraduates who mentor first-year students and facilitate a smooth transition from secondary school to tertiary studies.  Resident assistants  In addition to academic support, the College appoints a dynamic team of Resident Assistants (RAs) each year, who provide pastoral care to all students. RAs are students in their senior years of university and having already negotiated the transition to uni and living away from home, they are well-equipped to help out others. The RAs help staff and House Committee with many events and College initiatives and are a point of contact for all students. They also assist with the safety and security of the College and are on call for emergencies after hours. They work with the Dean of Students to ensure that everyone at College feels at home.  Admissions  The College admits between 70 and 100 students annually, in a competitive admissions process which involves a formal application and interview. The process is rolling throughout the year, and applications are accepted for students wishing to enter first year at the University of Sydney, as well as those in subsequent years of study and at post-graduate level. In addition to residential places, the College offers affiliate membership to enable students to access its academic and social programmes, but maintain independent living elsewhere. Affiliate applications are accepted throughout the year from women at all stages of their tertiary studies. The Women's College offers a number of scholarships for resident students on the basis of merit and financial need. Scholarships are available to students from government schools, rural areas, Indigenous and Torres Strait Islander backgrounds, post graduate medical students and students aiming to study at the Conservatorium of Music. The Grace Frazer Award (est. 1892) is an academic entrance prize given to the student or students who enter the College in their first year of tertiary study with the highest ATAR in their College fresher cohort. It was endowed by Marie Florence (Mrs Charles Burton) Fairfax, who was a member of the Ladies' Committee that raised funds to establish the College and was a member of the College Council from 1891‚Äì1893. The scholarship was established in honour of her sister Grace Frazer.  Philanthropy  The College has a strong record of philanthropy. The funds to erect the original Sulman & Power building and to bring the college into being, were raised largely by The Ladies' Committee, formed immediately following the original 1887 meeting. Its President was Lady Carrington (wife of the Governor) and its Honorary Secretary was Miss Mary Fairfax, and it included many other prominent members of Sydney society. This committee was successful in gathering large and small contributions from 496 subscribers sufficient to meet the conditions of the Endowment Act. Since that time, philanthropy has been a major source of financial support for every new building and capital works programme. As it receives no funding from government or the University, the College continues to look to its community for support in maintaining and expanding its mission. The Students' Club also runs its own philanthropic activities, with a Charity Committee that raises money and supports a variety of causes. Students and alumnae are encouraged to give back to the College through a variety of financial and service activities. Student life  House Committee  All students living at the Women's College are members of the Students' Club, which gives access to all College activities. The House Committee, a group of nine students, is the organising arm of the Students' Club, and it is elected by popular vote of the student body.  Leadership  The House Committee is led by the Senior Student. She occupies the highest-ranking student position in the College. Usually a student in her third or fourth year, is a member of the Women's College Council and reports on student activities to Council at its meetings throughout the year. The College values the contribution of its Senior Student very highly. Each year her name is placed on the honour roll in the dining hall. Former Senior Students include the Governor of NSW, Her Excellency Professor Marie Bashir A.C., Dr Meg Mulvey, Ms Jane Diplock and Ms Katrina Dawson. A wide range of other leadership opportunities are available with an extensive range of student committees, as well as structured in-house leadership programmes designed to enhance individual strengths and build on confidence. Each year Women's College students in third year and above are invited to participate in a mentoring program which matches students with mentors from a range of industries sourced from both the Women's College Alumnae and contacts external to College. Based on establishing personal contact between the mentor and the mentee, students and mentors are encouraged to meet face to face throughout the year.  Senior Common Room  The Senior Common Room (SCR) is the group of senior students at College. Membership is extended to all students in fourth year of university and above, and all members have access to the SCR: a secure air-conditioned room with comfortable seating and study facilities, where members often work. Each year the SCR selects a Senior Representative, who, together with a small social committee and the Senior Research Fellow, co-ordinates the activities of the group and organises a programme of social and academic events.  Traditions  The College song is \\"Home of Joy and Knowledge\\" sung to the tune of \\"Land of Hope and Glory\\". It continues to be sung regularly by students at sporting, cultural and other occasions. The Motto \\"Together\\" is a quotation from Tennyson's The Princess which tells the story of an heroic princess who forswears the world of men and founds a women's university where men are forbidden to enter. The College has a calendar of regular events, including: * Orientation Week ‚Äì to welcome the new students. * Chancellor's Dinner ‚Äì to award academic prizes. * Formal Dinner ‚Äì a weekly gathering of the whole College in academic attire with a speaker. * Louisa Macdonald Oration ‚Äì a biennial dinner with guest speaker to honour the founding principal.

It consists of ten elected councillors, a Treasurer, and four ex- officio councillors. These ex-officio councillors are: the Principal of the College, the Senior Student of the College, the President of the Women's College Alumnae, and the person nominated by the Senate of the University. The Council has three committees: Governance, Finance and Building & Development. In 1905 the chair of the Council was Senator James Walker. Emmeline Mary Dogherty Woolley was a council member from 1891 to 1908.

He served as the 26th Governor of Ohio during the final years of the American Civil War, dying in office of gangrene shortly after the war concluded. Early life and career Born in Marietta, Ohio, to an English immigrant and a Pennsylvania-born mother, Brough was orphaned at the age of 11. To support himself, he became a printer's apprentice, and later received three years of part-time education at Ohio University, where he worked part-time as a reporter for the Athens Mirror. He rose to become a newspaper publisher in Marietta and then in Lancaster, where he and his brother Charles purchased the Ohio Eagle, a paper that espoused the views of the Democratic Party. Brough served two years as Clerk of the Ohio Senate (where he also served as the capital correspondent for his newspaper, as well as the Ohio Statesman). He was elected as a Democrat to the Ohio House of Representatives in 1837, representing the Fairfield-Hocking district, and served from 1838‚Äì39, chairing the Committee on Banks and Currency. He then took office as State Auditor, serving until 1845, when the Whigs swept most of the state's Democrats out of office in the Election of 1844. He was a trustee of Ohio University from 1840 to 1843.Walker 1869 : 347 In 1841, he and his brother bought the Cincinnati Advertiser and renamed it the Cincinnati Enquirer. Brough then moved to Indiana, where he entered the railroad business and became President of the Madison and Indianapolis Railway in 1848. He later presided over the Bellefontaine and Indiana Railway. In Madison, Indiana, he was remembered for leading the railroad through a period in which it made Madison the leading pork packing city in the nation, but the line then fell prey to competition. His attempt to combat competing lines was the construction of two tunnels as part of an effort to avoid a steep incline at Madison. The company spent more than $300,000 on construction during two years, before the effort was stopped in 1855. The project was known locally as \\"Brough's Folly\\" and he left in 1853 when the Madison line underwent a short- lived merger with another railroad company. Brough was a very large and corpulent man, as well as being a hard worker. The railroad company named one of its engines \\"John Brough\\" in his honor When it arrived in Madison on May 10, 1850, the Madison Courier of May 11 made the following comment that was printed in the Scientific American of June 1, 1850. \\"We are told this engine is called the John Brough on account of its great weight and for the great amount of business it is capable of doing.\\" Governor of Ohio Ohio Republicans and War Democrats dissatisfied with the leadership of Ohio Gov. David Tod turned to Brough after he made a strongly pro-Union speech in his hometown of Marietta on June 10, 1863. He was elected to the governorship that fall on a pro-Union ticket, partly due to his stronger support than Tod of the anti-slavery direction that the Northern war effort was taking. Having been elected as a representative of the Unionist Party, Brough is the last Ohio governor to date who was neither a Democrat nor a Republican. Brough also defeated Copperhead leader Clement Vallandigham. This prompted President Abraham Lincoln to wire Brough, \\"Glory to God in the Highest. Ohio has saved the Nation.\\" Brough took office in January 1864. Ohio historian Walter Havighurst described Brough as being \\"a big bull of a man with driving energy,\\" and Richard H. Abbott wrote that he \\"had a reputation for rough and ready politics with a temperament to match... [he was] a blunt, outspoken, rude man who loved to chew tobacco [and thus] presented quite a contrast with his two handsome and dignified predecessors, William Dennison and David Tod.\\" As governor, Brough strongly supported the Lincoln Administration's war efforts and was key to persuading other Midwestern governors to raise 100-day regiments in early 1864 to release more seasoned troops for duty in Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's spring campaign. Ohio contributed more than 34,000 troops, and was the only one of the five participating states (the others were Indiana, Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin) to exceed its quota. Brough supported Lincoln's reelection in 1864, despite the machinations of Ohio's favorite son Salmon P. Chase, and worked tirelessly to support the state's soldiers in the field. When Chase resigned as Secretary of the Treasury, Brough was offered the position but declined it to remain as governor. With the conclusion of the war in 1865, the pro-Union alliance between Ohio's Republicans and War Democrats dissolved, and the now-dominant Republicans looked elsewhere for a candidate. On June 15, Brough announced that he would not seek the gubernatorial nomination again but would not decline it if offered; it was not. Later that summer, Brough stumbled in the State House yard, bruising his hand and badly spraining his ankle. Using a cane caused inflammation over time and gangrene eventually set in. Brough's sisters Mary and Jane, Brough, Caroline - his second wife, circa 1860. Abbott wrote that Brough \\"had given his full efforts to serving his state... [and did so] with energy and ability.\\" Historian Richard C. Knopf wrote, \\"Whatever may be said of Brough's partisanship and his lack of personal dignity, one must assess in his favor the qualities of integrity, perseverance, and public spiritedness.\\" Death and personal life Governor John Brough died in office on August 29 at the age of 53. He was buried at Woodland Cemetery in Cleveland. Brough was twice married and had seven children. In 1832, Brough married Achsah P. Pruden of Athens. She had two children. She died September 8, 1838 at Lancaster. Brough married Caroline A. Nelson, of Columbus, at Lewistown, Pennsylvania in 1843. She had five children.

She established the University of California Museum of Paleontology (UCMP), Museum of Vertebrate Zoology (MVZ), and financed their collections as well as a series of paleontological expeditions to the western United States at the turn of the 20th century. She took part in many of these expeditions, gathering a significant collection of fossils and exotic game animals in her own right. Life Annie Montague Alexander was born December 29, 1867, in Honolulu during the Kingdom of Hawaii in what is now the Mission Houses Museum. She was the granddaughter of New England missionaries in Maui, part of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Her father Samuel Thomas Alexander and her uncle Henry Perrine Baldwin were founders of Alexander & Baldwin. Her mother Martha Cooke was daughter of Amos Starr Cooke, the founder of Castle & Cooke. These were two of the \\"Big Five\\" corporations that started as sugar cane plantation owners and then dominated the economy of the Territory of Hawaii. Her cousins included Henry Alexander Baldwin and Clarence Hyde Cooke who carried on the family businesses, Charles Montague Cooke, Jr. who studied snails (malacology), and architect Charles William Dickey. She attended Punahou School for one year, but in 1882 her family moved to Oakland, California, to get medical attention for her grandfather, and she enrolled in Oakland High School. In 1886 she attended Lasell Seminary for Young Women in Auburndale, Massachusetts. In 1888 she traveled with her family to Paris and studied painting. She returned to Oakland and trained briefly as a nurse, but enjoyed being outside instead. Her father left the business to others and took Annie on a bicycle trip through Europe in 1893, and sailed through the Pacific in 1896. In 1899 she went camping in Oregon and then went with her father to Bermuda. Alexander first became fascinated with paleontology in 1900 while attending a lecture by Professor John C. Merriam at the University of California, Berkeley. She offered to underwrite the entire cost of his upcoming expeditions. She took part in Merriam's 1901 expedition to Fossil Lake in Oregon, and his 1902 and 1903 expeditions to Mount Shasta in northern California. In 1904, Alexander left on a trip with her father and Thomas L. Gulick, son of missionary Peter Johnson Gulick and younger brother of John Thomas Gulick who was an early developer of theories of evolution. The men were looking forward to hunting big game in Africa, while Annie was collecting fossils and taking pictures. Gulick became ill and died August 15, 1904, in Kijabe, Kenya. On September 8 the Alexanders reached Victoria Falls. The next day they crossed the Zambezi river and climbed down the canyon for a better view. While she was preparing to take a picture, Samuel was hit by a boulder tossed down from workers above that crushed his foot. The foot was amputated and her father was buried at the Old Drift cemetery after dying a day later on September 10, 1904.(name is Samuel Taylor Alexander on memorial) Memorial stone to Annie Alexander at the University of Colorado Campus. In 1905 she financed and took part in the Saurian Expedition to the West Humboldt Range in Nevada. The expedition discovered many of the finest specimens of ichthyosaur. From April to August 1907 Alexander financed and led a trip to Alaska; the expedition to southeastern Alaska included Alexander, Joseph S. Dixon, Chase Littlejohn, Frank Stephens and Kate Stephens. From 1908 she collaborated continuously in the field with her companion Louise Kellogg. She proposed a Natural History Museum at the University of California, offering to support its research and collections. In 1908 she helped finance the newly established Museum of Vertebrate Zoology after the state fell short in its appropriations. At her request, Joseph Grinnell served as its first director until his death in 1939. In 1920 when Merriam left the University to become president of the Carnegie Institution, the paleontology department was merged with the geology department, displeasing both Merriam and Alexander. She subsequently helped establish the UCMP and created an endowment for its funding. She also helped finance much of the work of William Diller Matthew and his prot√©g√© George Gaylord Simpson. Alexander shared her life with Kellogg for forty-two years. By all accounts, it was a devoted \\"Boston marriage\\". Among other activities, the two ran a working farm together; their asparagus was sold nationwide. Alexander continued to finance expeditions and perform field work throughout her life, celebrating her 80th birthday while in the Sierra de la Laguna mountains. She died of a stroke on September 10, 1950, and her ashes were buried at Makawao Union Church cemetery, overlooking her childhood home on Maui. At least seventeen species of plants and animals honor Alexander in their scientific names (such as Hydrotherosaurus alexandrae), and several others are named after Kellogg. Lake Alexander in Alaska is named for her. Family tree References Further reading External links Gay Bears: Annie Alexander and Louise Kellogg Annie Montague Alexander.

It also provides a system for action mapping, which allows the user to assign specific actions within a game to the buttons and axes of the input devices. Additionally it handles haptic feedback (input/output) devices. Microsoft introduced a new input library called XInput specifically for the Xbox 360 controller. DirectInput and XInput provide benefits over normal Win32 input events: * they enable an application to retrieve data from input devices even when the application is in the background * they provide full support for any type of input device, as well as for haptic feedback * through action mapping, applications can retrieve input data without needing to know what kind of device generated that input While DirectInput forms a part of the DirectX library, it has not been significantly revised since DirectX 8 (2001‚Äì2002). Microsoft recommends that new applications make use of the Windows message loop for keyboard and mouse input instead of DirectInput (as indicated in the Meltdown 2005 slideshow), and to use XInput instead of DirectInput for Xbox 360 controllers.  History  DirectX included DirectInput from version 1.0 (1995). It initially offered true support only for joysticks, as the mouse and keyboard modules simply provided wrappers to the standard Win32 API. DirectX version 3.0 (1996) added support for keyboards and mice; it also improved joystick support. DirectX 5.0 (1997) included greatly improved joystick support, including adding haptic feedback, increasing the number of buttons, changing the underlying device-driver model and incorporating a COM-based API. Mouse support also increased the number of buttons seen from four to eight. In DirectX 7.0 (1999- ), DirectInput added a long-promised feature of seeing individual mice much like individual joysticks, but the feature didn't work with the later released Windows XP, even though it works with Windows 98/Me and DirectX 9. DirectX 8.0 (2000), the last version with major changes, included action mapping and broader support for different types of devices. While Microsoft initially intended that DirectInput would handle all inputs, it hasn't turned out this way. Microsoft doesn't recommend using DirectInput for keyboards or mice, and has started pushing the newer XInput for Xbox 360 controllers. In Windows Vista, Windows 7 and later Windows versions, the in-built action mapping UI has been removed. DirectInput is not available for Windows Store apps.  XInput  XInput,http://msdn.microsoft.com/en- us/library/windows/desktop/ee417014(v=vs.85).aspx an API for \\"next generation\\" controllers, was introduced in December 2005 alongside the launch of the Xbox 360. This instruction set provided full support for Xbox 360 controllers in Windows XP SP1 and subsequent operating systems, and is described by Microsoft as being easier to program for and requiring less setup than DirectInput. XInput is compatible with DirectX version 9 and later. Xbox 360 Controller support An Xbox 360 Controller, with the default Microsoft driver, has the following limitations with DirectInput, compared to XInput: * the left and right triggers will act as a single axis representing the signed difference between the triggers, not as independent analog axes * vibration effects will not operate * querying for headset devices will not operate None of these limitations exist if using the Xbox 360 Controller with XInput.http://msdn.microsoft.com/en- us/library/windows/desktop/ee417014(v=vs.85).aspx Vibration effects will not work on the Xbox One Controller. According to MSDN, \\"the combination of the left and right triggers in DirectInput is by design. Games have always assumed that DirectInput device axes are centered when there is no user interaction with the device. However, the Xbox 360 controller was designed to register minimum value, not center, when the triggers are not being held.\\" MSDN proffered the \\"solution\\" of combining the triggers, setting one trigger to a positive direction and the other to a negative direction, so no user interaction is indicative to DirectInput of the \\"control\\" being at center. The above, however, ignores the fact that many DirectInput controllers, such as gamepads with dual analog sticks and racing-wheel controller sets, already map triggers and pedals independently. In addition, many DirectInput devices also have vibration effects. At least one driver, XBCD, gives the Xbox 360 controllers the vibration support, dead zones and (optionally) independent triggers through DirectInput. This suggests that Microsoft's Xbox 360 controller driver intentionally has weaker DirectInput support, rather than due to any differences between DirectInput and XInput APIs. On the other hand, Xbox 360 controller and XInput support only very basic control of vibration motors in contrast with great palette of various effects supported by DirectInput.  DirectInput vs XInput  Microsoft has not made any major changes to DirectInput since DirectX 8, and introduced XInput later in DirectX 9: there remains some confusion about the current status and future of the two APIs. The XInput API also has limits that DirectInput does not: * XInput supports only \\"next generation\\" controllers. This limits it basically to controllers for the Xbox 360 that also have Windows drivers. Legacy Windows controllers, joysticks and generalized haptic feedback devices are not supported. * XInput supports a maximum of four controllers at a time. This is an Xbox limit, carried over to Windows. Although few PC games require more than four controllers at once, DirectInput itself has no such limitation. * XInput does not support keyboards, mice, or mouse-type devices. While this mirrors Microsoft's recommendation not to use DirectInput with these devices, programmers can use DirectInput with these devices. * XInput supports maximum of 4 axes, 10 buttons, 2 triggers and 8-direction digital pad per controller, compared to DirectInput's support for 8 axes, 128 buttons, and full-range POV. (The number of axes, buttons and triggers XInput supports corresponds directly to the Xbox 360 controller.) Advantage of XInput over DirectInput: * When used with an Xbox 360 Controller, the left and right trigger buttons will act independently, instead of as a single buttonhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en- us/library/windows/desktop/ee417014(v=vs.85).aspx XInput is for Xbox 360 controllers, while DirectInput is for any controller. In XInput 1.4 introduced with Windows 8 support of querying for headset devices was reintroduced.

It provides a low-latency interface to sound card drivers written for Windows 95 through Windows XP and can handle the mixing and recording of multiple audio streams. DirectSound was originally written for Microsoft by John Miles. Besides providing the essential service of passing audio data to the sound card, DirectSound provides other essential capabilities such as recording and mixing sound, adding effects to sound (e.g., reverb, echo, or flange), using hardware accelerated buffers in Windows 95 through XP, and positioning sounds in 3D space. DirectSound also provides a means to capture sounds from a microphone or other input and controlling capture effects during audio capture.DirectSound Capture Effects: MSDN After many years of development, today DirectSound is a mature API, and supplies many other useful capabilities, such as the ability to play multichannel sounds at high resolution. While DirectSound was designed to be used by games, today it is used to play audio in many audio applications. DirectShow uses DirectSound's hardware audio acceleration capabilities if the sound card's hardware audio acceleration capabilities exist and are exposed by the audio driver.DirectShow FAQ Features DirectSound is a user mode API that provides an interface between applications and the sound card driver, enabling applications to produce sounds and play back music. DirectSound was considered revolutionary when it was introduced in 1995, as it featured multiple simultaneous audio streams and allowed several applications to access the sound card simultaneously. Before that, the game developers were required to implement their own audio rendering engine in software. DirectSound provides sample rate conversion and sound mixing (volume and pan) for an unlimited number of audio sources; however, the practical limits are the number of hardware audio sources and the performance of software mixers. The DirectSound architecture features a concept of the \\"ring buffer\\" which would be continuously played in a cycle. The application programmer creates the sound buffer then continuously queries its state through the \\"read cursor\\" and updates it with the \\"write cursor\\". There are two types of buffers - a \\"streaming\\" buffer, which holds continuous sounds such as background music, and a \\"static\\" buffer which holds short sounds. On supported sound cards, DirectSound would try to use \\"hardware accelerated\\" buffers, i.e. the ones which either can be placed in local sound card memory, or can be accessed by the sound card from the system memory. If hardware acceleration is not available, DirectSound would create audio buffers in the system memory and use purely software mixing. Some late DOS-era \\"wavetable\\" sound cards such as Sound Blaster AWE32 and Gravis Ultrasound featured dedicated DSPs, which were borrowed from the digital music instruments. These cards featured local memory which could be used for buffering multiple audio streams and mixing them on board, thus offloading the CPU and greatly improving the sound quality. However, this was only possible in DOS by directly programming the hardware, and full-featured \\"hardware acceleration\\" from the local memory was never implemented on these cards, due to complexities of double buffering. Later cards such as Sound Blaster Live!, Audigy and X-Fi are capable of accessing the system memory buffers directly. DirectSound3D DirectSound3D (DS3D) is an extension to DirectSound introduced with DirectX 3 in 1996 with the intention to standardize 3D audio in Windows. DirectSound3D allows software developers to utilize audio by writing once for a single audio API instead of rewriting code numerous times to work for each audio card vendor. In DirectX 5, DirectSound3D gained the support for sound cards that use third party 3D audio algorithms in order to accelerate DirectSound3D properly, through methods approved by Microsoft. In DirectX 8, DirectSound and DirectSound3D (DS3D) were officially merged and given the name DirectX Audio, however the API is still commonly referred to as DirectSound. EAX EAX is an extension to DirectSound and DirectSound3D which provides sound effects processing to the hardware-accelerated buffers. OS Support Windows 95 In Windows 95, 98 and Me, the DirectSound mixer component and the sound card drivers were both implemented as a kernel- mode VxD driver (Dsound.vxd), allowing direct access to the primary buffer used by the audio hardware and thus, providing the lowest possible latency between the user-mode API and the underlying hardware, but in some cases causing instability and blue screen errors. Windows 98 introduced WDM Audio and the Kernel Audio Mixer driver (KMixer), which enabled digital mixing, routing and processing of simultaneous audio streams with a higher quality sample rate conversion as well as kernel streaming. Under WDM, DirectSound sends data to the software-based KMixer. Windows 98 Second Edition improved WDM audio support by adding DirectSound hardware buffering, DirectSound3D hardware abstraction, KMixer sample-rate conversion (SRC) for capture streams, multichannel audio support and introduction of DirectMusic. If the audio hardware supports hardware mixing (also known as hardware buffering or DirectSound hardware acceleration), DirectSound buffers directly to the rendering device.DirectSound Driver Models If DirectSound streams use hardware mixing, KMixer and its latency delay are bypassed.Overview of DirectSound Hardware Acceleration On Windows 98 and Windows Me, WDM audio drivers were preferred but compatibility with VxD driver model was preserved. Although Windows Driver Model (WDM) was available starting with Windows 98, few audio card manufacturers used it. Due to internal buffering, KMixer introduced significant processing latency (30 ms on then-current systems). Windows 98 also includes a WDM streaming class driver (Stream.sys) to address these real time multimedia data stream processing requirements. When the sound card uses a custom driver for use with the system supplied port class driver PortCls.sys or implements a mini-driver for use with the streaming class driver, applications can bypass the KMixer completely and use the kernel streaming interfaces instead to reduce latency. Windows 2000/XP In Windows 2000, Microsoft also implemented the same WDM-based audio stack on Windows NT by introducing the WDM audio drivers and the kernel mixer component (KMixer).CakeWalk - Windows Pro Audio Roundtable In Windows XP, Microsoft introduced another improved kernel streaming class driver, AVStream. Beginning with Windows XP, hardware acceleration was also added for DirectSound capture effects processingExposing Hardware-Accelerated Capture Effects such as Acoustic Echo Cancellation for USB microphones, noise suppression and array microphone support. Windows Vista/Windows 7 Windows Vista features a completely re-written audio stack based on the Universal Audio Architecture. Because of the architectural changes in the redesigned audio stack, a direct path from DirectSound to the audio drivers does not exist. DirectSound, DirectMusic and other APIs such as MME are emulated as WASAPI Session instances. DirectSound runs in emulation mode on the Microsoft software mixer. The emulator does not have hardware abstraction, so there is no hardware DirectSound acceleration, meaning hardware and software relying on DirectSound acceleration may have degraded performance. It's likely a supposed performance hit might not be noticeable, depending on the application and actual system hardware. In the case of hardware 3D audio effects played using DirectSound3D, they will not be playable; this also breaks compatibility with EAX extensions.Creative Technology - Support - Audio in Windows Vista Third-party APIs such as ASIO and OpenAL are not affected by these architectural changes in Windows Vista, as they use IOCtl to interface directly with the audio driver. A solution for applications that wish to take advantage of hardware accelerated high-quality 3D positional audio is to use OpenAL. However, this only works if the manufacturer provides an OpenAL driver for their hardware. As of 2007, a solution to re-enable hardware acceleration of DirectSound3D and Audio Effects, such as EAX, called Creative ALchemy was launched. Creative ALchemy intercepts calls to DirectSound3D and translates them into OpenAL calls to be processed by supported hardware such as Sound Blaster X-Fi and Sound Blaster Audigy. For software-based Creative audio solutions, ALchemy utilizes its built-in 3D audio engine without using OpenAL at all. Realtek, a manufacturer of integrated HD audio codecs, has a product similar to ALchemy called 3D SoundBack. C-Media, a manufacturer of PC sound card chipsets, also has a solution called Xear3D EX, although it works instead by intercepting DirectSound3D calls transparently in the background without any user intervention. Windows 8 WASAPI audio stack in Windows 8 introduces support for \\"hardware offloading\\" of multiple audio streams to the audio card for mixing and effect processing, in addition to the software processing introduced in Vista,Audio Offloading: Exposing Hardware-Offloaded Audio Processing in WindowsWindows Driver Kit - Windows Developer Preview - New for Audio Drivers however the functionality is only exposed for Windows Runtime apps.http://msdn.microsoft.com/en- us/library/windows/hardware/dn265105(v=vs.85).aspx DirectSound's and DirectMusic's hardware interfaces to sound card drivers are not implemented. Windows CE Although DirectSound support was available in Windows CE versions up to 4.2, it was removed starting 5.0.Windows CE 5.0 removed functionality Windows CE 6.0 also does not support DirectSound, instead favoring that applications be rewritten to use the Waveform Audio API.

Architecturally, DirectMusic is a high-level set of objects, built on top of DirectSound, that allow the programmer to play sound and music without needing to get quite as low-level as DirectSound. DirectSound allows for the capture and playback of digital sound samples, whereas DirectMusic works with message-based musical data. Music can be synthesized either in hardware, in the Microsoft GS Wavetable SW Synth, or in a custom synthesizer.  History  DirectMusic was first released by Microsoft in 1996 as an ActiveX control called Interactive Music Architecture (IMA). It was introduced as part of the 6.1 version of the DirectX library in February 1999 and is included in all Microsoft Windows operating systems starting with Windows 98 Second Edition. DirectMusic has since been deprecated, and is not available to 64-bit applications in Windows Vista. In Windows 7, native 64-bit support is available for the core DirectMusic API related to timestamped MIDI but not for the performance component.DirectX Frequently Asked Questions  Details  DirectMusic provides a complete system for implementing dynamic soundtracks that take advantage of hardware acceleration, Downloadable Sounds (DLS), DirectX Media Objects (DMOs), advanced 3D positioning effects and several other features. DirectMusic provides composition and playback of dynamic musical soundtracks based on stored compositional material. Rather than a static playback, the music is generated on the fly, and is played with variations, and can respond to flexible program events. Using DirectMusic, it is possible to: * Load and play sounds from files or resources in MIDI, WAV, or DirectMusic Producer run- time format. The small file size of DirectMusic soundtracks makes it very well suited for Web applications. * Schedule the timing of musical events with high precision. DirectMusic allows timestamping of MIDI input data at the moment of arrival to a system wide reference clock. Music or sound effects composed for DirectMusic can be very flexible and can change dynamically over time or in response to a user event. DirectMusic addresses the problems of Windows' legacy MidiOut API, which has shaky timing and limited real-time control. * Play from multiple sources simultaneously, each with separate timing and instrument sets. * Send tempo changes, patch changes, and other MIDI events programmatically. * Use Downloadable Sounds (DLS), an open standard by the MIDI Manufacturers Association, allowing developers to output 'wavetable' sounds on audio hardware not equipped with 'wavetable' sample-based synthesis. The downloadable sounds can be extended to include new or customized instruments. * On computers with sound card which lack 'wavetable' sample- based synthesis, DirectSound's Software Synthesizer ensures that message-based music such as MIDI files and DirectMusic segments sound identical on all hardware configurations rather than playing differently on different computers with different sound cards. An application can also play an unlimited variety of instruments and even produce unique sounds for individual notes and velocities. * Locate sounds in a 3D environment. * Easily apply pitch changes, reverberation, and other effects. * Use more than 16 MIDI channels. DirectMusic makes it possible for any number of voices to be played simultaneously, up to the limits of the synthesizer. * Play segments on different audio paths, so that effects or spatialization can be applied individually to each sound. * Capture MIDI data, or stream it from one port to another. * DirectMusic Producer can be used to create sound files that take full advantage of DirectMusic's interactive features. On Microsoft Windows Vista, DirectMusic uses only software synthesis. Also, the DirectMusic kernel mode synthesizer that supplies the DirectMusic components with a high- resolution timer has been removed.Timing jitter and clock drift when editing or playing MIDI in Windows Vista  See also  * DirectSound * MIDI * DirectX plugin * XACT  References  * Microsoft's DirectMusic documentation  External links  * DirectMusic for the masses * DirectMusic Producer for the masses Audio libraries Music DirectMusic ","title":"DirectMusic"},{"id":"700218","text":"DirectShow (sometimes abbreviated as DS or DShow), codename Quartz, is a multimedia framework and API produced by Microsoft for software developers to perform various operations with media files or streams. It is the replacement for Microsoft's earlier Video for Windows technology. Based on the Microsoft Windows Component Object Model (COM) framework, DirectShow provides a common interface for media across various programming languages, and is an extensible, filter-based framework that can render or record media files on demand at the request of the user or developer. The DirectShow development tools and documentation were originally distributed as part of the DirectX SDK. Currently, they are distributed as part of the Windows SDK (formerly known as the Platform SDK). Microsoft plans to completely replace DirectShow gradually with Media Foundation in future Windows versions. One reason cited by Microsoft is to provide \\"much more robust support for content protection systems\\"http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en- US/36661a0b-fefa-4719-8134-6956e505e6f7/is-the-new-media-foundation-a- replacement-of-direct-show?forum=mediafoundationdevelopment MSFT Becky Weiss (see digital rights management). Microsoft's Becky Weiss also confirms that \\"you'll notice that working with the Media Foundation requires you to work at a slightly lower level than working with DirectShow would have. And there are still DirectShow features that aren't (yet) in Media Foundation\\". As described in the Media Foundation article, Windows Vista and Windows 7 applications use Media Foundation instead of DirectShow for several media related tasks. History The direct predecessor of DirectShow, ActiveMovie (codenamed Quartz), was originally chartered to provide MPEG-1 file playback support for Windows. It was also intended as a future replacement for media processing frameworks like Video for Windows, which had never been designed to handle codecs that put video frames into a different order during the compression process, and the Media Control Interface, which had never been fully ported to a 32-bit environment and did not utilize COM. The Quartz team started with an existing project called Clockwork. Clockwork was a modular media processing framework in which semi-independent components worked together to process digital media streams, and had previously been used in several projects, including the Microsoft Interactive Television (MITV) project and another project named Tiger. ActiveMovie was announced in March 1996, and released in May 1996, bundled with the beta version of Internet Explorer 3.0. In March 1997, Microsoft announced that ActiveMovie would become part of the DirectX 5 suite of technologies, and around July started referring to it as DirectShow, reflecting Microsoft's efforts at the time to consolidate technologies that worked directly with hardware under a common naming scheme. DirectShow became a standard component of all Windows operating systems starting with Windows 98; however it is available on Windows 95 by installing the latest available DirectX redistributable. In DirectX version 8.0, DirectShow became part of the mainline distribution of the DirectX SDK and was placed alongside other DirectX APIs. In October 2004, DirectShow was removed from the main DirectX distribution and relocated to the DirectX Extras download. In April 2005, DirectShow was removed entirely from DirectX and moved to the Windows SDK starting with the Windows Server 2003 SP1 version of the SDK. The DirectX SDK was, however, still required to build some of the DirectShow samples. Since November 2007, DirectShow APIs are part of the Windows SDK. It includes several new enhancements, codecs and filter updates such as the Enhanced Video Renderer (EVR) and DXVA 2.0 (DirectX Video Acceleration). Architecture DirectShow divides a complex multimedia task (e.g. video playback) into a sequence of fundamental processing steps known as filters.Introduction to DirectShow application programmingDirectShow system overview Each filterwhich represents one stage in the processing of the datahas input and/or output pins that may be used to connect the filter to other filters. The generic nature of this connection mechanism enables filters to be connected in various ways so as to implement different complex functions. To implement a specific complex task, a developer must first build a filter graph by creating instances of the required filters, and then connecting the filters together. There are three main types of filters: ;Source filters: These provide the source streams of data. For example, reading raw bytes from any media file. ;Transform filters: These transform data that is provided from other filter's output. For example, doing a transform such as adding text on top of video or uncompressing an MPEG frame. ;Renderer filters: These render the data. For example, sending audio to the sound card, drawing video on the screen or writing data to a file. During the rendering process, the filter graph searches the Windows Registry for registered filters and builds its graph of filters based on the locations provided. After this, it connects the filters together, and, at the developer's request, executes (i.e., plays, pauses, etc.) the created graph. DirectShow filter graphs are widely used in video playback (in which the filters implement functions such as file parsing, video and audio demultiplexing, decompressing and rendering) as well as for video and audio recording, editing, encoding, transcoding or network transmission of media. Interactive tasks such as DVD navigation may also be controlled by DirectShow. Filter graph of an mp3 file, as rendered by the DirectShow sample in GraphEdit, an application with a GUI for DirectShow used to visually build and test filter graphs. In this picture the boxes represent filters and the grey dots appearing on the sides of the filters represent pins. In the above example, from left to right, the graph contains a source filter to read an MP3 file, stream splitter and decoder filters to parse and decode the audio, and a rendering filter to play the raw audio samples. Each filter has one or more pins that can be used to connect that filter to other filters. Every pin functions either as an output or input source for data to flow from one filter to another. Depending on the filter, data is either \\"pulled\\" from an input pin or \\"pushed\\" to an output pin in order to transfer data between filters. Each pin can only connect to one other pin and they have to agree on what kind of data they are sending. Most filters are built using a set of C++ classes provided in the DirectShow SDK, called the DirectShow Base Classes. These handle much of the creation, registration and connection logic for the filter. For the filter graph to use filters automatically, they need to be registered in a separate DirectShow registry entry as well as being registered with COM. This registration can be managed by the DirectShow Base Classes. However, if the application adds the filters manually, they do not need to be registered at all. Unfortunately, it is difficult to modify a graph that is already running. It is usually easier to stop the graph and create a new graph from scratch. Starting with DirectShow 8.0, dynamic graph building, dynamic reconnection, and filter chains were introduced to help alter the graph while it was running. However, many filter vendors ignore this feature, making graph modification problematic after a graph has begun processing. Although DirectShow is capable of dynamically building a graph to render a given media type, in certain instances it is difficult for developers to rely on this functionality and they need to resort to manually building filter graphs if the resulting filter graph is variable. It is possible for filter graphs to change over time as new filters are installed on the computer. Features By default, DirectShow includes a number of filters for decoding some common media file formats such as MPEG-1, MP3, Windows Media Audio, Windows Media Video, MIDI, media containers such as AVI, ASF, WAV, some splitters/demultiplexers, multiplexers, source and sink filters, some static image filters, and minimal digital rights management (DRM) support. DirectShow's standard format repertoire can be easily expanded by means of a variety of filters, enabling DirectShow to support virtually any container format and any audio or video codec. For example, filters have been developed for Ogg Vorbis, Musepack, and AC3, and some codecs such as MPEG-4 Advanced Simple Profile, AAC, H.264, Vorbis and containers MOV, MP4 are available from 3rd parties like ffdshow, K-Lite, and CCCP. Incorporating support for additional codecs such as these can involve paying the licensing fees to the involved codec technology developer or patent holder. Finally, there are \\"bridge\\" filters that simultaneously support multiple formats, as well as functions like stream multiplexing, by exposing the functionality of underlying multimedia APIs such as VLC. The amount of work required to implement a filter graph depends on several factors. In the simplest case, DirectShow can create a filter graph automatically from a source such as a file or URL. If this is not possible, the developer may be able to manually create a filter graph from a source file, possibly with the addition of a custom filter, and then let DirectShow complete the filter graph by connecting the filters together. At the next level, the developer must build the filter graph from scratch by manually adding and connecting each desired filter. Finally, in cases where an essential filter is unavailable, the developer must create a custom filter before a filter graph can be built. Unlike the main C API of QuickTime where it is necessary to call MoviesTask in a loop to load a media file, DirectShow handles all of this in a transparent way. It creates several background threads that smoothly play the requested file or URL without much work required from the programmer. Also in contrast to QuickTime, nothing special is required for loading a URL instead of a local file on diskDirectShow's filter graph abstracts these details from the programmer, although recent developments in QuickTime (including an ActiveX control) have reduced this disparity. DirectShow Editing Services DirectShow Editing Services (DES), introduced in DirectX 8.0/Windows XP is an API targeted at video editing tasks and built on top of the core DirectShow architecture. DirectShow Editing Services was introduced for Microsoft's Windows Movie Maker. It includes APIs for timeline and switching services, resizing, cropping, video and audio effects, as well as transitions, keying, automatic frame rate and sample rate conversion and such other features which are used in non-linear video editing allowing creation of composite media out of a number of source audio and video streams. DirectShow Editing Services allow higher-level run-time compositing, seeking support, and graph management, while still allowing applications to access lower-level DirectShow functions. While the original API is in C++, DirectShow Editing Services is accessible in any Microsoft .NET compatible language including Microsoft Visual C# and Microsoft Visual Basic by using a third-party code library called \\"DirectShowNet Library\\". Alternatively, the entire DirectShow API, including DirectShow Editing Services, can be accessed from Borland Delphi 5, 6 and 7, C++ Builder 6, and from later versions with a few minor modifications, using a third party software library called \\"DSPack\\". As of March, 2012 (and, apparently as early as 2009), Microsoft has stated that the DirectShow Editing Services \\"API is not supported and may be altered or unavailable in the future.\\" Video rendering filters Originally, in Windows 9x, DirectShow used the Video Renderer filter. This drew the images using DirectDraw 3, but could also fall back to GDI or overlay drawing modes in some circumstances (depending upon the visibility of the video window and the video card's capabilities). It had limited access to the video window. Video for Windows had been plagued with deadlocks caused by applications' incorrect handling of the video windows, so in early DirectShow releases, the handle to the playback window was hidden from applications. There was also no reliable way to draw caption text or graphics on top of the video. DirectShow 6.0, released as part of DirectX Media introduced the Overlay Mixer renderer designed for DVD playback and broadcast video streams with closed captioning and subtitles. The Overlay Mixer uses DirectDraw 5 for rendering. Downstream connection with the Video Renderer is required for window management. Overlay Mixer also supports Video Port Extensions (VPE), enabling it to work with analog TV tuners with overlay capability (sending video directly to a video card via an analog link rather than via the PCI bus). Overlay Mixer also supports DXVA connections. Because it always renders in overlay, full-screen video to TV-out is always activated. Starting with Windows XP, a new filter called the Video Mixing Renderer 7 (VMR-7 or sometimes just referred to as VMR) was introduced. The number 7 was because VMR-7 only used DirectDraw version 7 to render the video and did not have the option to use GDI drawing. The main new feature of VMR-7 was the ability to mix multiple streams and graphics with alpha blending, allowing applications to draw text and graphics over the video and support custom effects. It also featured a \\"windowless mode\\" (access to the composited image before it is rendered) which fixed the problems with access to the window handle. DirectX 9 introduced VMR-9, which is included in Windows XP SP2 and newer.https://web.archive.org/web/20101018035741/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en- gb/library/ee416979(VS.85).aspx This version uses Direct3D 9 instead of DirectDraw, allowing developers to transform video images using the Direct3D pixel shaders. It is available for all Windows platforms as part of the DirectX 9 redistributable. As VMR-7 it provides a Windowless Mode. However, unlike Overlay mixer or VMR-7 it does not support video ports. Using the /3GB boot option may cause VMR-9 to fail.http://forum.videohelp.com/threads/292160-Loss-of-DirectDraw-Overlay-and- VMR9-after-upgrade-update Windows Vista and Windows 7 ship with a new renderer, available as both a Media Foundation component and a DirectShow filter, called the Enhanced Video Renderer (EVR). EVR is designed to work with Desktop Window Manager and supports DXVA 2.0, which is available on Windows Vista and Windows 7. It offers better performance and better quality according to Microsoft. Reception Awards On January 8, 2007. Microsoft received the Emmy award for Streaming Media Architectures and Components at the 58th Annual Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards. Simplicity Commanding DirectShow to play a file is a relatively simple task. However, while programming more advanced customizations, such as commanding DirectShow to display certain windows messages from the video window or creating custom filters, many developers complain of difficulties. It is regarded as one of Microsoft's most complex development libraries/APIs. Developers rarely create DirectShow filters from scratch. Rather, they employ DirectShow Base Classes. The Base Classes can often simplify development, allowing the programmer to bypass certain tasks. However, the process may remain relatively complex; the code found in the Base Classes is nearly half the size of the entire MFC library. As a result, even with the Base Classes, the number of COM objects that DirectShow contains often overwhelms developers. In some cases, DirectShow's API deviates from traditional COM rules, particularly with regard to the parameters used for methods. To overcome their difficulties with DirectShow's unique COM rules, developers often turn to a higher level API that uses DirectShow, notably, Windows Media Player SDK, an API provides the developer with an ActiveX Control that has fewer COM interfaces to deal with. Although DirectShow is capable of dynamically building a graph to render a given media type, in certain instances it is difficult for developers to rely on this functionality and they need to resort to manually building filter graphs if the resulting filter graph is variable. It is possible for filter graphs to change over time as new filters are installed on the computer. Codec hell Codec hell (a term derived from DLL hell) is when multiple DirectShow filters conflict for performing the same task. A large number of companies now develop codecs in the form of DirectShow filters, resulting in the presence of several filters that can decode the same media type. This issue is further exacerbated by DirectShow's merit system, where filter implementations end up competing with one another by registering themselves with increasingly elevated priority. Microsoft's Ted Youmans explained that \\"DirectShow was based on the merit system, with the idea being that, using a combination of the filter‚Äôs merit and how specific the media type/sub type is, one could reasonably pick the right codec every time. It wasn't really designed for a competing merit nuclear arms race.\\" A tool to help in the troubleshooting of \\"codec hell\\" issues usually referenced is the GSpot Codec Information Appliance, which can be useful in determining what codec is used to render video files in AVI and other containers. GraphEdit can also help understanding the sequence of filters that DirectShow is using to render the media file. Codec hell can be resolved by manually building filter graphs, using a media player that supports ignoring or overriding filter merits, or by using a filter manager that changes filter merits in the Windows Registry. End-user tools DirectShow, being a developer-centric framework and API, does not directly offer end-user control over encoding content, nor does it incorporate a user interface for encoding using installed codecs or to different formats; instead, it relies on developers to develop software using the API. In contrast, other multimedia frameworks such as QuickTime or Video for Windows allow end-users to perform basic video-related tasks such as re- encoding using a different codec and editing files and streams. The convenience offered by an end-user GUI is apparent since the AVI format and codecs used by Video for Windows still remain in use, for example VirtualDub.

Some of the specimens were returned to Berkeley and became part of the collection of the University of California Museum of Paleontology, which Alexander helped found and underwrite.

The effort is undertaken by a developer, ranging from a single person to an international team dispersed across the globe. Development of traditional commercial PC and console games is normally funded by a publisher, and can take several years to reach completion. Indie games usually take less time and money and can be produced by individuals and smaller developers. The independent game industry has been on the rise, facilitated by the growth of accessible game development software such as Unity platform and Unreal Engine and new online distribution systems such as Steam and Uplay, as well as the mobile game market for Android and iOS devices. The first video games, developed in the 1960s, were not usually commercialised. They required mainframe computers to run and were not available to the general public. Commercial game development began in the '70s with the advent of first-generation video game consoles and early home computers like the Apple I. At that time, owing to low costs and low capabilities of computers, a lone programmer could develop a full and complete game. However, in the late '80s and '90s, ever-increasing computer processing power and heightened expectations from gamers made it difficult for a single person to produce a mainstream console or PC game. The average cost of producing a triple-A video game slowly rose, from 1‚Äì4 million in 2000, to over $5 million in 2006, then to over $20 million by 2010. Mainstream commercial PC and console games are generally developed in phases: first, in pre-production, pitches, prototypes, and game design documents are written; if the idea is approved and the developer receives funding, then full-scale development begins. The development of a complete game usually involves a team of 20‚Äì100 individuals with various responsibilities, including designers, artists, programmers, and testers.  Overview  Games are produced through the software development process. Games are developed as a creative outlet and to generate profit. Game making is considered both art and science. Development is normally funded by a publisher. Well-made games bring profit more readily. However, it is important to estimate a game's financial requirements, such as development costs of individual features. Failing to provide clear implications of game's expectations may result in exceeding allocated budget. In fact, the majority of commercial games do not produce profit. Most developers cannot afford changing their development schedule mid-way, and require estimating their capabilities with available resources before production. The game industry requires innovations, as publishers cannot profit from constant release of repetitive sequels and imitations. Every year new independent development companies open and some manage to develop hit titles. Similarly, many developers close down because they cannot find a publishing contract or their production is not profitable. It is difficult to start a new company due to high initial investment required. Nevertheless, growth of casual and mobile game market has allowed developers with smaller teams to enter the market. Once the companies become financially stable, they may expand to develop larger games. Most developers start small and gradually expand their business. A developer receiving profit from a successful title may store up capital to expand and re-factor their company, as well as tolerate more failed deadlines. An average development budget for a multiplatform game is US$18-28M, with high-profile games often exceeding $40M. In the early era of home computers and video game consoles in the early 1980s, a single programmer could handle almost all the tasks of developing a game ‚Äî programming, graphical design, sound effects, etc. It could take as little as six weeks to develop a game. However, the high user expectations and requirements of modern commercial games far exceed the capabilities of a single developer and require the splitting of responsibilities. A team of over a hundred people can be employed full-time for a single project. Game development, production, or design is a process that starts from an idea or concept. Often the idea is based on a modification of an existing game concept. The game idea may fall within one or several genres. Designers often experiment with different combinations of genres. A game designer generally writes an initial game proposal document, that describes the basic concept, gameplay, feature list, setting and story, target audience, requirements and schedule, and finally staff and budget estimates. Different companies have different formal procedures and philosophies regarding game design and development. There is no standardized development method; however commonalities exist. A game developer may range from a single individual to a large multinational company. There are both independent and publisher-owned studios. Independent developers rely on financial support from a game publisher. They usually have to develop a game from concept to prototype without external funding. The formal game proposal is then submitted to publishers, who may finance the game development from several months to years. The publisher would retain exclusive rights to distribute and market the game and would often own the intellectual property rights for the game franchise. Publisher's company may also own the developer's company, or it may have internal development studio(s). Generally the publisher is the one who owns the game's intellectual property rights. All but the smallest developer companies work on several titles at once. This is necessary because of the time taken between shipping a game and receiving royalty payments, which may be between 6 and 18 months. Small companies may structure contracts, ask for advances on royalties, use shareware distribution, employ part-time workers and use other methods to meet payroll demands. Console manufacturers, such as Microsoft, Nintendo, or Sony, have a standard set of technical requirements that a game must conform to in order to be approved. Additionally, the game concept must be approved by the manufacturer, who may refuse to approve certain titles. Most modern PC or console games take from three to five years to complete., where as a mobile game can be developed in a few months. The length of development is influenced by a number of factors, such as genre, scale, development platform and number of assets. Some games can take much longer than the average time frame to complete. An infamous example is 3D Realms' Duke Nukem Forever, announced to be in production in April 1997 and released fourteen years later in June 2011. Planning for Maxis' game Spore began in late 1999; the game was released nine years later in September 2008. The game Prey was briefly profiled in a 1997 issue of PC Gamer, but was not released until 2006, and only then in highly altered form. Finally, Team Fortress 2 was in development from 1998 until its 2007 release, and emerged from a convoluted development process involving \\"probably three or four different games\\", according to Gabe Newell. The game revenue from retails is divided among the parties along the distribution chain, such as ‚Äî developer, publisher, retail, manufacturer and console royalty. Many developers fail to profit from this and go bankrupt. Many developers seek alternative economic models through Internet marketing and distribution channels to improve returns., as through a mobile distribution channel the share of a developer can be up to 70% of the total revenue and through an online distribution channel almost 100%.  History  The history of game making begins with the development of the first video games, although which video game is the first depends on the definition of video game. The first games created had little entertainment value, and their development focus was separate from user experience‚Äîin fact, these games required mainframe computers to play them. OXO, written by Alexander S. Douglas in 1952, was the first computer game to use a digital display. In 1958, a game called Tennis for Two, which displayed its output on an oscilloscope, was made by Willy Higinbotham, a physicist working at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. In 1961, a mainframe computer game called Spacewar! was developed by a group of Massachusetts Institute of Technology students led by Steve Russell. True commercial design and development of games began in the 1970s, when arcade video games and first- generation consoles were marketed. In 1971, Computer Space was the first commercially sold, coin-operated video game. It used a black-and-white television for its display, and the computer system was made of 74 series TTL chips. In 1972, the first home console system was released called Magnavox Odyssey, developed by Ralph H. Baer. That same year, Atari released Pong, an arcade game that increased video game popularity. The commercial success of Pong led other companies to develop Pong clones, spawning the video game industry. Programmers worked within the big companies to produce games for these devices. The industry did not see huge innovation in game design and a large number of consoles had very similar games. Many of these early games were often Pong clones. Some games were different, however, such as Gun Fight, which was significant for several reasons: an early 1975 on-foot, multi- directional shooter, which depicted game characters, game violence, and human- to-human combat. Tomohiro Nishikado's original version was based on discrete logic, which Dave Nutting adapted using the Intel 8080, making it the first video game to use a microprocessor.Steve L. Kent (2001), The ultimate history of video games: from Pong to Pok√©mon and beyond : the story behind the craze that touched our lives and changed the world, p. 64, Prima, Console manufacturers soon started to produce consoles that were able to play independently developed games, and ran on microprocessors, marking the beginning of second-generation consoles, beginning with the release of the Fairchild Channel F in 1976. The flood of Pong clones led to the video game crash of 1977, which eventually came to an end with the mainstream success of Taito's 1978 arcade shooter game Space Invaders, marking the beginning of the golden age of arcade video games and inspiring dozens of manufacturers to enter the market. Its creator Nishikado not only designed and programmed the game, but also did the artwork, engineered the arcade hardware, and put together a microcomputer from scratch. It was soon ported to the Atari 2600, becoming the first \\"killer app\\" and quadrupling the console's sales. At the same time, home computers appeared on the market, allowing individual programmers and hobbyists to develop games. This allowed hardware manufacturer and software manufacturers to act separately. A very large number of games could be produced by an individual, as games were easy to make because graphical and memory limitation did not allow for much content. Larger companies developed, who focused selected teams to work on a title. The developers of many early home video games, such as Zork, Baseball, Air Warrior, and Adventure, later transitioned their work as products of the early video game industry. The industry expanded significantly at the time, with the arcade video game sector alone (representing the largest share of the gaming industry) generating higher revenues than both pop music and Hollywood films combined. The home video game industry, however, suffered major losses following the North American video game crash of 1983. In 1984 Jon Freeman warned in Computer Gaming World: Chris Crawford and Don Daglow in 1987 similarly advised prospective designers to write games as a hobby first, and to not quit their existing jobs early. The home video game industry was revitalized soon after by the widespread success of the Nintendo Entertainment System. Compute!'s Gazette in 1986 stated that although individuals developed most early video games, \\"It's impossible for one person to have the multiple talents necessary to create a good game\\". By 1987 a video game required 12 months to develop and another six to plan marketing. Projects remained usually solo efforts, with single developers delivering finished games to their publishers. With the ever-increasing processing and graphical capabilities of arcade, console and computer products, along with an increase in user expectations, game design moved beyond the scope of a single developer to produce a marketable game. The Gazette stated, \\"The process of writing a game involves coming up with an original, entertaining concept, having the skill to bring it to fruition through good, efficient programming, and also being a fairly respectable artist\\". This sparked the beginning of team-based development. In broad terms, during the 1980s, pre-production involved sketches and test routines of the only developer. In the 1990s, pre-production consisted mostly of game art previews. In the early 2000s, pre-production usually produced a playable demo. In 2000 a 12 to 36 month development project was funded by a publisher for US$1M‚Äì3M. Additionally, $250k‚Äì1.5M were spent on marketing and sales development. In 2001, over 3000 games were released for PC; and from about 100 games turning profit only about 50 made significant profit. In the early 2000s it became increasingly common to use middleware game engines, such as Quake engine or Unreal engine. In the early 2000s, also mobile games started to gain popularity. However, mobile games distributed by mobile operators remained a marginal form of gaming until the Apple App Store was launched in 2008. In 2005, a mainstream console video game cost from US$3M to $6M to develop. Some games cost as much as $20M to develop. In 2006 the profit from a console game sold at retail was divided among parties of distribution chain as follows: developer (13%), publisher (32%), retail (32%), manufacturer (5%), console royalty (18%). In 2008 a developer would retain around 17% of retail price and around 85% if sold online. Since the third generation of consoles, the home video game industry has constantly increased and expanded. The industry revenue has increased at least five-fold since the 1990s. In 2007, the software portion of video game revenue was $9.5 billion, exceeding that of the movie industry. The Apple App Store, introduced in 2008, was the first mobile application store operated directly by the mobile platform holder. It significantly changed the consumer behaviour more favourable for downloading mobile content and quickly broadened the markets of mobile games. In 2009 games' market annual value was estimated between $7‚Äì30 billion, depending on which sales figures are included. This is on par with films' box office market. A publisher would typically fund an independent developer for $500k‚Äì$5M for a development of a title. In 2012, the total value had already reached $66.3 billion and by then the video game markets were no longer dominated by console games. According to Newzoo, the share of MMO's was 19.8%, PC/MAC's 9.8%, tablets' 3.2%, smartphones 10.6%, handhelds' 9.8%, consoles' only 36.7% and online casual games 10.2%. The fastest growing market segments being mobile games with an average annual rate of 19% for smartphones and 48% for tablets. In the past several years, many developers opened and many closed down. Each year a number of developers are acquired by larger companies or merge with existing companies. For example, in 2007 Blizzard Entertainment's parent company, Vivendi Games merged with Activision. In 2008 Electronic Arts nearly acquired Take-Two Interactive. In 2009 Midway Games was acquired by Time-Warner and Eidos Interactive merged with Square Enix.  Roles   Producer  Development is overseen by internal and external producers. The producer working for the developer is known as the internal producer and manages the development team, schedules, reports progress, hires and assigns staff, and so on. The producer working for the publisher is known as the external producer and oversees developer progress and budget. Producer's responsibilities include PR, contract negotiation, liaising between the staff and stakeholders, schedule and budget maintenance, quality assurance, beta test management, and localization. This role may also be referred to as project manager, project lead, or director.  Publisher  A video game publisher is a company that publishes video games that they have either developed internally or have had developed by an external video game developer. As with book publishers or publishers of DVD movies, video game publishers are responsible for their product's manufacturing and marketing, including market research and all aspects of advertising. They usually finance the development, sometimes by paying a video game developer (the publisher calls this external development) and sometimes by paying an internal staff of developers called a studio. Consequently, they also typically own the IP of the game. Large video game publishers also distribute the games they publish, while some smaller publishers instead hire distribution companies (or larger video game publishers) to distribute the games they publish. Other functions usually performed by the publisher include deciding on and paying for any license that the game may utilize; paying for localization; layout, printing, and possibly the writing of the user manual; and the creation of graphic design elements such as the box design. Large publishers may also attempt to boost efficiency across all internal and external development teams by providing services such as sound design and code packages for commonly needed functionality. Because the publisher usually finances development, it usually tries to manage development risk with a staff of producers or project managers to monitor the progress of the developer, critique ongoing development, and assist as necessary. Most video games created by an external video game developer are paid for with periodic advances on royalties. These advances are paid when the developer reaches certain stages of development, called milestones. Independent video game developers create games without a publisher and may choose to digitally distribute their games.  Development team  Developers can range in size from small groups making casual games to housing hundreds of employees and producing several large titles. Companies divide their subtasks of game's development. Individual job titles may vary; however, roles are the same within the industry. The development team consists of several members. Some members of the team may handle more than one role; similarly more than one task may be handled by the same member. Team size can vary from 20 to 100 or more members, depending on the game's scope. The most represented are artists, followed by programmers, then designers, and finally, audio specialists, with two to three producers in management. These positions are employed full-time. Other positions, such as testers, may be employed only part-time. Salaries for these positions vary depending on both the experience and the location of the employee. An entry-level programmer can make, on average, around $70,000 annually and an experienced programmer can make, on average, around $125,000 annually.\\"Top Gaming Studios, Schools & Salaries\\", Big Fish Games A development team includes these roles or disciplines: = Designer = A game designer is a person who designs gameplay, conceiving and designing the rules and structure of a game. Development teams usually have a lead designer who coordinates the work of other designers. They are the main visionary of the game. One of the roles of a designer is being a writer, often employed part-time to conceive game's narrative, dialogue, commentary, cutscene narrative, journals, video game packaging content, hint system, etc. In larger projects, there are often separate designers for various parts of the game, such as, game mechanics, user interface, characters, dialogue, graphics, etc. = Artist = A game artist is a visual artist who creates video game art. The art production is usually overseen by an art director or art lead, making sure their vision is followed. The art director manages the art team, scheduling and coordinating within the development team. The artist's job may be 2D oriented or 3D oriented. 2D artists may produce concept art, sprites, textures, environmental backdrops or terrain images, and user interface. 3D artists may produce models or meshes, animation, 3D environment, and cinematics. Artists sometimes occupy both roles. = Programmer = A game programmer is a software engineer who primarily develops video games or related software (such as game development tools). The game's codebase development is handled by programmers. There are usually one to several lead programmers, who implement the game's starting codebase and overview future development and programmer allocation on individual modules. Individual programming disciplines roles include: * Physics ‚Äì the programming of the game engine, including simulating physics, collision, object movement, etc.; * AI ‚Äì producing computer agents using game AI techniques, such as scripting, planning, rule-based decisions, etc. * Graphics ‚Äì the managing of graphical content utilization and memory considerations; the production of graphics engine, integration of models, textures to work along the physics engine. * Sound ‚Äì integration of music, speech, effect sounds into the proper locations and times. * Gameplay ‚Äì implementation of various games rules and features (sometimes called a generalist); * Scripting ‚Äì development and maintenance of high-level command system for various in-game tasks, such as AI, level editor triggers, etc. * UI ‚Äì production of user interface elements, like option menus, HUDs, help and feedback systems, etc. * Input processing ‚Äì processing and compatibility correlation of various input devices, such as keyboard, mouse, gamepad, etc. * Network communications ‚Äì the managing of data inputs and outputs for local and internet gameplay. * Game tools ‚Äì the production of tools to accompany the development of the game, especially for designers and scripters. = Level designer = A level designer is a person who creates levels, challenges or missions for computer and/or video games using a specific set of programs. These programs may be commonly available commercial 3D or 2D design programs, or specially designed and tailored level editors made for a specific game. Level designers work with both incomplete and complete versions of the game. Game programmers usually produce level editors and design tools for the designers to use. This eliminates the need for designers to access or modify game code. Level editors may involve custom high-level scripting languages for interactive environments or AIs. As opposed to the level editing tools sometimes available to the community, level designers often work with placeholders and prototypes aiming for consistency and clear layout before required artwork is completed. = Sound engineer = Sound engineers are technical professionals responsible for sound effects and sound positioning. They sometimes oversee voice acting and other sound asset creation. Composers who create a game's musical score also comprise a game's sound team, though often this work is outsourced. = Tester = The quality assurance is carried out by game testers. A game tester analyzes video games to document software defects as part of a quality control. Testing is a highly technical field requiring computing expertise, and analytic competence. The testers ensure that the game falls within the proposed design: it both works and is entertaining.This involves testing of all features, compatibility, localization, etc. Although, necessary throughout the whole development process, testing is expensive and is often actively utilized only towards the completion of the project.  Development process  Game development is a software development process, as a video game is software with art, audio, and gameplay. Formal software development methods are often overlooked. Games with poor development methodology are likely to run over budget and time estimates, as well as contain a large number of bugs. Planning is important for individual and group projects alike. Overall game development is not suited for typical software life cycle methods, such as the waterfall model. One method employed for game development is agile development. It is based on iterative prototyping, a subset of software prototyping. Agile development depends on feedback and refinement of game's iterations with gradually increasing feature set. This method is effective because most projects do not start with a clear requirement outline. A popular method of agile software development is Scrum. Another successful method is Personal Software Process (PSP) requiring additional training for staff to increase awareness of project's planning. This method is more expensive and requires commitment of team members. PSP can be extended to Team Software Process, where the whole team is self-directing. Game development usually involves an overlap of these methods. For example, asset creation may be done via waterfall model, because requirements and specification are clear, but gameplay design might be done using iterative prototyping. Development of a commercial game usually includes the following stages:  Pre-production  Pre-production or design phase is a planning phase of the project focused on idea and concept development and production of initial design documents. The goal of concept development is to produce clear and easy to understand documentation, which describes all the tasks, schedules and estimates for the development team. The suite of documents produced in this phase is called production plan. This phase is usually not funded by a publisher, however good publishers may require developers to produce plans during pre-production. The concept documentation can be separated into three stages or documents‚Äîhigh concept, pitch and concept; however, there is no industry standard naming convention, for example, both Bethke (2003) and Bates (2004) refer to pitch document as \\"game proposal\\", yet Moore, Novak (2010) refers to concept document as \\"game proposal\\". The late stage of pre-production may also be referred to as proof of concept, or technical review when more detailed game documents are produced. Publishers have started to expect broader game proposals even featuring playable prototypes. = High concept = High concept is a brief description of a game. The high concept is the one-or two- sentence response to the question, \\"What is your game about?\\". = Pitch = A pitch, concept document, proposal document, or game proposal is a short summary document intended to present the game's selling points and detail why the game would be profitable to develop. Verbal pitches may be made to management within the developer company, and then presented to publishers. A written document may need to be shown to publishers before funding is approved. A game proposal may undergo one to several green-light meetings with publisher executives who determine if the game is to be developed. The presentation of the project is often given by the game designers. Demos may be created for the pitch; however may be unnecessary for established developers with good track records. If the developer acts as its own publisher, or both companies are subsidiaries of a single company, then only the upper management needs to give approval. = Concept = Concept document, game proposal, or game plan is a more detailed document than the pitch document. This includes all the information produced about the game. This includes the high concept, game's genre, gameplay description, features, setting, story, target audience, hardware platforms, estimated schedule, marketing analysis, team requirements, and risk analysis. Before an approved design is completed, a skeleton crew of programmers and artists usually begins work. Programmers may develop quick- and-dirty prototypes showcasing one or more features that stakeholders would like to see incorporated in the final product. Artists may develop concept art and asset sketches as a springboard for developing real game assets. Producers may work part-time on the game at this point, scaling up for full-time commitment as development progresses. Game producers work during pre- production is related to planning the schedule, budget and estimating tasks with the team. The producer aims to create a solid production plan so that no delays are experienced at the start of the production. = Game design document = Before a full-scale production can begin, the development team produces the first version of a game design document incorporating all or most of the material from the initial pitch. The design document describes the game's concept and major gameplay elements in detail. It may also include preliminary sketches of various aspects of the game. The design document is sometimes accompanied by functional prototypes of some sections of the game. The design document remains a living document throughout the development‚Äîoften changed weekly or even daily. Compiling a list of game's needs is called \\"requirement capture\\". = Prototype = Placeholder graphics are characteristic of early game prototypes. Writing prototypes of gameplay ideas and features is an important activity that allows programmers and game designers to experiment with different algorithms and usability scenarios for a game. A great deal of prototyping may take place during pre-production before the design document is complete and may, in fact, help determine what features the design specifies. Prototyping at this stage is often done manually, (paper prototyping), not digitally, as this is often easier and faster to test and make changes before wasting time and resources into what could be a canceled idea or project. Prototyping may also take place during active development to test new ideas as the game emerges. Prototypes are often meant only to act as a proof of concept or to test ideas, by adding, modifying or removing some of the features. Most algorithms and features debuted in a prototype may be ported to the game once they have been completed. Often prototypes need to be developed quickly with very little time for up-front design (around 15 to 20 minutes of testing). Therefore, usually very prolific programmers are called upon to quickly code these testbed tools. RAD tools may be used to aid in the quick development of these programs. In case the prototype is in a physical form, programmers and designers alike will make the game with paper, dice, and other easy to access tools in order to make the prototype faster. A successful development model is iterative prototyping, where design is refined based on current progress. There are various technology available for video game development  Production  Production is the main stage of development, when assets and source code for the game are produced. Mainstream production is usually defined as the period of time when the project is fully staffed. Programmers write new source code, artists develop game assets, such as, sprites or 3D models. Sound engineers develop sound effects and composers develop music for the game. Level designers create levels, and writers write dialogue for cutscenes and NPCs. Game designers continue to develop the game's design throughout production. = Design = Game design is an essential and collaborative process of designing the content and rules of a game, requiring artistic and technical competence as well as writing skills. Creativity and an open mind is vital for the completion of a successful video game. During development, the game designer implements and modifies the game design to reflect the current vision of the game. Features and levels are often removed or added. The art treatment may evolve and the backstory may change. A new platform may be targeted as well as a new demographic. All these changes need to be documented and disseminated to the rest of the team. Most changes occur as updates to the design document. = Programming = The programming of the game is handled by one or more game programmers. They develop prototypes to test ideas, many of which may never make it into the final game. The programmers incorporate new features demanded by the game design and fix any bugs introduced during the development process. Even if an off-the-shelf game engine is used, a great deal of programming is required to customize almost every game. = Level creation = From a time standpoint, the game's first level takes the longest to develop. As level designers and artists use the tools for level building, they request features and changes to the in-house tools that allow for quicker and higher quality development. Newly introduced features may cause old levels to become obsolete, so the levels developed early on may be repeatedly developed and discarded. Because of the dynamic environment of game development, the design of early levels may also change over time. It is not uncommon to spend upwards of twelve months on one level of a game developed over the course of three years. Later levels can be developed much more quickly as the feature set is more complete and the game vision is clearer and more stable. = Art production = = Audio production = Game audio may be separated into three categories‚Äîsound effects, music, and voice-over. Sound effect production is the production of sounds by either tweaking a sample to a desired effect or replicating it with real objects. Sound effects are important and impact the game's delivery. Music may be synthesized or performed live. There are several ways in which music is presented in a game. * Music may be ambient, especially for slow periods of game, where the music aims to reinforce the aesthetic mood and game setting. * Music may be triggered by in-game events. For example, in such games as Pac-Man or Mario, player picking up power-ups triggered respective musical scores. * Action music, such as chase, battle or hunting sequences is fast-paced, hard-changing score. * Menu music, similar to credits music, creates aural impact while relatively little action is taking place. A game title with 20 hours of single-player gameplay may feature around 1 hour. Voice-overs and voice acting creates character gameplay interactivity. Voice acting adds personality to the game's characters. = Testing = At the end of the project, quality assurance plays a significant role. Testers start work once anything is playable. This may be one level or subset of the game software that can be used to any reasonable extent. Early on, testing a game occupies a relatively small amount of time. Testers may work on several games at once. As development draws to a close, a single game usually employs many testers full-time (and often with overtime). They strive to test new features and regression test existing ones. Testing is vital for modern, complex games as single changes may lead to catastrophic consequences. At this time features and levels are being finished at the highest rate and there is more new material to be tested than during any other time in the project. Testers need to carry out regression testing to make sure that features that have been in place for months still operate correctly. Regression testing is one of the vital tasks required for effective software development. As new features are added, subtle changes to the codebase can produce unexpected changes in different portions of the game. This task is often overlooked, for several reasons. Sometimes, when a feature is implemented and tested, it is considered \\"working\\" for the rest of the project and little attention is given to repeated testing. Also, features that are added late in development are prioritized and existing features often receive insufficient testing time. Proper regression testing is also increasingly expensive as the number of features increases and is often not scheduled correctly. Despite the dangers of overlooking regression testing, some game developers and publishers fail to test the full feature suite of the game and ship a game with bugs. This can result in customers dissatisfaction and failure to meet sales goals. When this does happen, most developers and publishers quickly release patches that fix the bugs and make the game fully playable again.  Milestones  Video game development milestones follow a similar process as with other software development. Commercial game development projects may be required to meet milestones set by publisher. Milestones mark major events during game development and are used to track game's progress. Such milestones may be, for example, first playable, alpha, or beta game versions. Project milestones depend on the developer schedules. Milestones are usually based on multiple short descriptions for functionality; examples may be \\"Player roaming around in game environment\\" or \\"Physics working, collisions, vehicle\\" etc. (numerous descriptions are possible). These milestones are usually how the developer gets paid; sometimes as \\"an advance against royalty\\". These milestones are listed, anywhere from three to twenty depending on developer and publisher. The milestone list is usually a collaborative agreement between the publisher and developer. The developer usually advocates for making the milestone descriptions as simple as possible; depending on the specific publisher - the milestone agreements may get very detailed for a specific game. When working with a good publisher, the \\"spirit of the law\\" is usually adhered to regarding milestone completion... in other words if the milestone is 90% complete the milestone is usually paid with the understanding that it will be 100% complete by the next due milestone. It is a collaborative agreement between publisher and developer, and usually (but not always) the developer is constrained by heavy monthly development expenses that need to be met. Also, sometimes milestones are \\"swapped\\", the developer or publisher may mutually agree to amend the agreement and rearrange milestone goals depending on changing requirements and development resources available. Milestone agreements are usually included as part of the legal development contracts. After each \\"milestone\\" there is usually a payment arrangement. Some very established developers may simply have a milestone agreement based on the amount of time the game is in development (monthly / quarterly) and not specific game functionality - this is not as common as detailed functionality \\"milestone lists\\". There is no industry standard for defining milestones, and such vary depending on publisher, year, or project. Some common milestones for two-year development cycle are as follows: = First playable = The first playable is the game version containing representative gameplay and assets, this is the first version with functional major gameplay elements. It is often based on the prototype created in pre-production. Alpha and first playable are sometimes used to refer to a single milestone, however large projects require first playable before feature complete alpha. First playable occurs 12 to 18 months before code release. It is sometimes referred to as the \\"Pre-Alpha\\" stage. = Alpha = Alpha is the stage when key gameplay functionality is implemented, and assets are partially finished. A game in alpha is feature complete, that is, game is playable and contains all the major features. These features may be further revised based on testing and feedback. Additional small, new features may be added, similarly planned, but unimplemented features may be dropped. Programmers focus mainly on finishing the codebase, rather than implementing additions. = Code freeze = Code freeze is the stage when new code is no longer added to the game and only bugs are being corrected. Code freeze occurs three to four months before code release. = Beta = Beta is feature and asset complete version of the game, when only bugs are being fixed. This version contains no bugs that prevent the game from being shippable. No changes are made to the game features, assets, or code. Beta occurs two to three months before code release. = Code release = Code release is the stage when many bugs are fixed and game is ready to be shipped or submitted for console manufacturer review. This version is tested against QA test plan. First code release candidate is usually ready three to four weeks before code release. = Gold master = Gold master is the final game's build that is used as a master for production of the game. = Release schedules and \\"crunch time\\" = In most AAA game development, games are announced a year or more and given a planned release date or approximate window so that they can promote and market the game, establish orders with retailers, and entice consumers to pre-order the game. Delaying the release of a video game can have negative financial impact for publishers and developers, and extensive delays may lead to project cancellation and employee layoffs. To assure a game makes a set release date, publishers and developers may require their employees to work overtime to complete the game, which is considered common in the industry. This overtime is often referred to it as \\"crunch time\\" or \\"crunch mode\\". In 2004 and afterwards, the culture of crunch time in the industry came under scrutiny, leading to many publishers and developers to reduce the expectation on developers for overtime work and better schedule management, though crunch time still can occur.  Post-production  After the game goes gold and ships, some developers will give team members comp time (perhaps up to a week or two) to compensate for the overtime put in to complete the game, though this compensation is not standard. = Maintenance = Once a game ships, the maintenance phase for the video game begins. Games developed for video game consoles have had almost no maintenance period in the past. The shipped game would forever house as many bugs and features as when released. This was common for consoles since all consoles had identical or nearly identical hardware; making incompatibility, the cause of many bugs, a non-issue. In this case, maintenance would only occur in the case of a port, sequel, or enhanced remake that reuses a large portion of the engine and assets. In recent times popularity of online console games has grown, and online capable video game consoles and online services such as Xbox Live for the Xbox have developed. Developers can maintain their software through downloadable patches. These changes would not have been possible in the past without the widespread availability of the Internet. PC development is different. Game developers try to account for majority of configurations and hardware. However, the number of possible configurations of hardware and software inevitably leads to discovery of game-breaking circumstances that the programmers and testers didn't account for. Programmers wait for a period to get as many bug reports as possible. Once the developer thinks they've obtained enough feedback, the programmers start working on a patch. The patch may take weeks or months to develop, but it's intended to fix most accounted bugs and problems with the game that were overlooked past code release, or in rare cases, fix unintended problems caused by previous patches. Occasionally a patch may include extra features or content or may even alter gameplay. In the case of a massively multiplayer online game (MMOG), such as a MMORPG or MMORTS, the shipment of the game is the starting phase of maintenance. Such online games are in continuous maintenance as the gameworld is continuously changed and iterated and new features are added. The maintenance staff for a popular MMOG can number in the dozens, sometimes including members of the original programming team.  Outsourcing  Several development disciplines, such as audio, dialogue, or motion capture, occur for relatively short periods of time. Efficient employment of these roles requires either large development house with multiple simultaneous title production or outsourcing from third- party vendors. Employing personnel for these tasks full-time is expensive, so a majority of developers outsource a portion of the work. Outsourcing plans are conceived during the pre-production stage; where the time and finances required for outsourced work are estimated. * The music cost ranges based on length of composition, method of performance (live or synthesized), and composer experience. In 2003 a minute of high quality synthesized music cost between US$600-1.5k. A title with 20 hours of gameplay and 60 minutes of music may have cost $50k-60k for its musical score. * Voice acting is well-suited for outsourcing as it requires a set of specialized skills. Only large publishers employ in-house voice actors. * Sound effects can also be outsourced. * Programming is generally outsourced less than other disciplines, such as art or music. However, outsourcing for extra programming work or savings in salaries has become more common in recent years.  Marketing  The game production has similar distribution methods to those of music and film industries. The publisher's marketing team targets the game for a specific market and then advertises it. The team advises the developer on target demographics and market trends, as well as suggests specific features. The game is then advertised and the game's high concept is incorporated into the promotional material, ranging from magazine ads to TV spots. Communication between developer and marketing is important. The length and purpose of a game demo depends on the purpose of the demo and target audience. A game's demo may range between a few seconds (such as clips or screenshots) to hours of gameplay. The demo is usually intended for journalists, buyers, trade shows, general public, or internal employees (who, for example, may need to familiarize with the game to promote it). Demos are produced with public relations, marketing and sales in mind, maximizing the presentation effectiveness.  Trade show demo  As a game nears completion, the publisher will want to showcase a demo of the title at trade shows. Many games have a \\"Trade Show demo\\" scheduled. The major annual trade shows are, for example, Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) or Penny Arcade Expo (PAX). E3 is the largest show in North America. E3 is hosted primarily for marketing and business deals. New games and platforms are announced at E3 and it received broad press coverage. Thousands of products are on display and press demonstration schedules are kept. In recent years E3 has become a more closed- door event and many advertisers have withdrawn, reducing E3's budget. PAX, created by authors of Penny Arcade blog and web-comic, is a mature and playful event with a player-centred philosophy.  Localization  A game created in one language may also be published in other countries which speak a different language. For that region, the developers may want to translate the game to make it more accessible. For example, some games created for PlayStation Vita were initially published in Japanese language, like Soul Sacrifice. Non-native speakers of the game's original language may have to wait for the translation of the game to their language. But most modern big- budget games take localization into account during the development process and the games are released in several different languages simultaneously. Localization is the process of translating the language assets in a game into other languages. By localizing games, they increase their level of accessibility where games could help to expend the international markets effectively. Game localization is generally known as language translations yet a \\"full localization\\" of a game is a complex project. Different levels of translation range from: zero translation being that there is no translation to the product and all things are sent raw, basic translation where only a few text and subtitles are translated or even added, and a full translation where new voice overs and game material changes are added. There are various essential elements on localizing a game including translating the language of the game to adjusting in-game assets for different cultures to reach more potential consumers in other geographies (or globalization for short). Translation seems to fall into the scope of localization, which itself constitutes a substantially broader endeavor. These include the different levels of translation to the globalization of the game itself. However, certain developers seem to be divided on whether globalization falls under localization or not. Moreover, in order to fit into the local markets, game production companies often change or redesign the graphic designs or the packaging of the game for marketing purposes. For example, the popular game Assassin's Creed has two different packaging designs for the Japanese and US market. By localizing the graphics and packaging designs, companies might arouse better connections and attention from the consumers from various regions.  Indie development  Independent games or indie games are produced by individuals and small teams with no large-scale developer or publisher affiliations. Indie developers generally rely on Internet distribution schemes. Many hobbyist indie developers create mods of existing games. Indie developers are credited for creative game ideas (for example, Darwinia, Weird Worlds, World of Goo). Current economic viability of indie development is questionable, however in recent years internet delivery platforms, such as, Xbox Live Arcade and Steam have improved indie game success. In fact, some indie games have become very successful, such as Braid, World of Goo, and Minecraft. In recent years many communities have emerged in support of indie games such as the popular indie game marketplace Itch.io, indie game YouTube channels and a large indie community on Steam (service). It is common for indie game developers to release games for free and generate revenue through other means such as microtransactions (in-game transactions), in-game advertisements and crowd-funding services like Patreon and Kickstarter.  Game industry  The video game industry (formally referred to as interactive entertainment) is the economic sector involved with the development, marketing and sale of video games. The industry sports several unique approaches.  Locales  = United States = In the United States, in the early history of video game development, the prominent locale for game development was the corridor from San Francisco to Silicon Valley in California. Most new developers in the US open near such \\"hot beds\\". At present, many large publishers still operate there, such as: Activision Blizzard, Capcom Entertainment, Disney Interactive, Eidos Interactive, Electronic Arts, Foundation 9, LucasArts Entertainment, Namco Bandai Games, Sega of America, Sony Computer Entertainment America, THQ. However, due to the nature of game development, many publishers are present in other regions, such as Big Fish Games (Washington), GarageGames (Oregon), Majesco Entertainment (New Jersey), Microsoft Corporation (Washington), Nintendo of America (Washington), Take-Two Interactive (New York), SouthPeak Games (Virginia).  Education  Many universities and design schools are offering classes specifically focused on game development. Some have built strategic alliances with major game development companies. These alliances ensure that students have access to the latest technologies and are provided the opportunity to find jobs within the gaming industry once qualified. Many innovative ideas are presented at conferences, such as Independent Games Festival (IGF) or Game Developers Conference (GDC). Indie game development may motivate students who produce a game for their final projects or thesis and may open their own game company.  Stability  Video game industry employment is fairly volatile, similar to other artistic industries including television, music, etc. Scores of game development studios crop up, work on one game, and then quickly go under. This may be one reason why game developers tend to congregate geographically; if their current studio goes under, developers can flock to an adjacent one or start another from the ground up. In an industry where only the top 20% of products make a profit, it's easy to understand this fluctuation. Numerous games may start development and are cancelled, or perhaps even completed but never published. Experienced game developers may work for years and yet never ship a title: such is the nature of the business.

He was first introduced as an obnoxious frat boy in the college strip The Academia Waltz, which ran in the University of Texas's Daily Texan during 1978 and 1979.Breathed 1990, page 2. Steve then reappears in Bloom County after graduation as a self-employed, unscrupulous lawyer. He was the first character to have been featured in all four of Breathed's comic strips. He appeared regularly, albeit much older, in the Sunday-only Opus. On June 12, 2013, Steve Dallas made a guest appearance in Pearls Before Swine.  In Bloom County In the early days of Bloom County, Steve was usually seen hitting on schoolteacher Bobbi Harlow, whom he briefly dated and failed to ever woo back once she left him for Cutter John. He frequently dated Bobbi's dimwitted cousin, Quiche Loraine, to make her jealous (the plan did not work). Most residents of Bloom County, especially women, either despised him or indifferently tolerated his presence. The one exception was Opus the Penguin, who idolized him and tagged along with him like a younger brother. Steve often used Opus' hero worship to manipulate the hapless penguin into doing his dirty work (although occasionally Steve was heard to have threatened Opus into helping him instead). He was often shown to hold strongly conservative political positions (albeit to a lesser extent than in The Academia Waltz), to the extent that the Reagan White House's policies were only sometimes enough to satisfy him. (He remarked early in the President's tenure that he thought \\"Haig and the generals should run Reagan and his liberal pack right out of the White House.\\") However, both he and the other (mostly liberal) characters became less hostile to Reagan's policies as both the strip's run and Reagan's tenure ran on. In another strip, a flashback of Dallas's teenage years showed him reading conservative author William F. Buckley's book God and Man at Yale. Dallas did not, however, seem to hold the traditionalist religious moral principles that were associated with Reagan and his allies on the right at the time, as his womanizing and lack of religious practice would indicate. He once went so far as to say that, \\"My God. We've got to get Carter back in the White House\\" after associating Ronald Reagan's presidency with the end of the Sexual revolution and therefore the end of his conquests at \\"Bob's Bar & Flesh Market\\". Like most conservatives (and liberals, and others) portrayed in Breathed's work, Steve's political positions do not appear to stem from actual convictions. As a lawyer, Steve took on hopeless cases defending psychotic and obviously guilty criminals and murderers, much to the chagrin of his overbearing mother. On one occasion, he did win a case (his client had allegedly murdered her husband with an axe), but only because the jury cared more about what the woman wore than whether or not she was innocent (at one point, she found a plastic picnic knife and supposedly tried to make a fillet out of a CNN cameraman). A bachelor throughout the entire run of the strip, he was the most aggressive womanizer and most blatant male chauvinist of all the eligible males in the cartoon. Outside of the courts, Steve's professionalism was questionable. In one instance he attempts to collect from a past due client by saying \\"Attention criminal pervert, where the hell is my dough, you twisted goon?\\". Opus, however, who at the time is working as a paralegal, writes in the actual letter \\"We still await payment of your legal fee\\". He was briefly the manager of Billy and the Boingers, a Def Leppard-esque glam metal band consisting of Opus, Bill the Cat, and Hodge-Podge. Steve briefly became a different person shortly after he was abducted by aliens. On board their spaceship, the aliens had originally planned to transplant Elvis Presley's brain into Steve's head. However, after Steve threatened the aliens with a lawsuit, they decided to perform the \\"Gephardtization\\" process on him instead, which was the same procedure used previously on then-U.S. House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt to completely reverse opinions and attitudes. After being presumed dead by the residents of Bloom County, Steve was zapped back to earth a few days later. To the whole county's amazement, he was now a sensitive, caring liberal and feminist. He stopped wearing his trademark sunglasses, quit smoking, got a permBreathed 1990, pages 133‚Äì135, 142. (thinking it made him look like Alan Alda), and canvassed for Jesse Jackson's 1988 Presidential campaign. This carried on for about a year, until Steve found out that his girlfriend Gladys was cheating on him with the bassist for \\"Guns 'n Spittle\\" and Opus had been using his toothbrush to comb his nose hair. Devastated, he resolved to forever avenge feminine betrayal, and by doing so, he put his trademark sunglasses back on. He immediately returned to his old, cantankerous self.Breathed 1990, pages 240‚Äì242. During the closing down of Bloom County in the final days of the strip, Steve seeks employment in other strips. He is seen (in the strip) to land a guest spot in Cathy, much to the title character's horror. (Many years later, in the revived Bloom County, the Cathy character slept with Steve Dallas, and regretted it in the morning.) In the 21st century reboot of Bloom County Steve remains a major character. Outland and Opus At the end of Outland in 1995, Steve came out of the closet and admitted he was gay. In his final appearance in the comic, he had married a man (Doonesbury's Mark Slackmeyer) and was thinking about adopting children. However, in Opus nine years later, Steve was back to his babe-mongering ways after enrolling in the \\"Rev. Doogle De-Poofta\\" which used shock therapy to attempt to \\"cure\\" homosexuality; in a form of conversion therapy. Steve was depicted as a middle-aged man with thinning hair and a noticeable paunch. Steve was also reunited with his long-lost son Auggie, and reluctantly took on the role of father figure. The August 26, 2007 strip implied that he was romantically involved with the recently re-introduced character Lola Granola. Lola is a former love interest of Opus.  The \\"real\\" Steve Dallas Breathed has stated that Dallas was based on a real person. > Steve Dallas...a frat-boy lawyer who I knew in school. He's never written > me. I suspect he was shot by an annoyed girlfriend, which saved me many > legal feesBreathed, Berke (2009). Bloom County: The Complete Library: Volume > One: 1980‚Äì1982, San Diego: IDW Publishing. pp 68. . The name \\"Steve Dallas\\" also appears in the classic and cynical noir film Sweet Smell of Success, wherein a cool jazz musician named Steve Dallas dates the wrong girl (kid sister of a sinister and influential columnist played by Burt Lancaster) and gets set up for a drug bust as a result. In the 2013 movie Are You Here, Owen Wilson plays 'Steve Dallas', an inveterate womanizer. In one scene, Dallas is slumped in a recliner wearing sunglasses just as his Bloom County namesake often does. Notes References *Breathed, Berke (1990). Classics of Western Literature.

It was operated by American Pro Cricket LLC (APC), a private company independent of the ICC and the USACA. The league was formed in 2004 as one of several independent efforts by different organizations to develop and promote cricket in the United States. APC originally announced that it was fully funded for at least three years of competition, but the league struggled through in its initial season due to poor attendance. Although most of the games were shown on Dish network PPV , the competition was linked to the unsuccessful launch of the so named \\"American Desi TV\\" channel based out of New Jersey. The league ceased operations after the 2004 season. Game-play format The format of the games were 20 overs a side, similar to Twenty20 cricket. However, there were two major changes from the rules of cricket used elsewhere: *Overs consist of five balls instead of six. *Bowlers could bowl up to five overs each (25% of the total), meaning only four bowlers are needed rather than five. Additionally, the league used a \\"designated hitter\\" rule, in which teams consist of 12 players, 11 of whom field and 11 of whom bat. This was similar to such rules existing in some domestic List A cricket competitions. All of these changes were designed to shorten the game and produce more aggressive batting, which the league administrators believed would help make the sport more appealing to the US public. Each team was allowed a limited roster of global players from professional cricket teams outside the U.S. The ICC however ruled that because Pro Cricket was not organised by the USACA, contracted players from ICC Test nations could not be released from their contracts to play in Pro Cricket matches. However, several notable players without contracts, such as Ajay Jadeja, Daren Ganga, Mervyn Dillon, and Rahul Sanghvi took part in the competition. Although cricket had a strong following in the U.S. up to the mid-19th century, its popularity dwindled with the rise of baseball, and it remained an almost unknown sport throughout the 20th century. The U.S. was one of the first nations to become an Associate Member of the ICC, in 1965, but growth of the game there languished until the late 1990s, when the ICC focused development efforts on the country. Progress since has been slow but steady, and many hoped that Pro Cricket would prove to be a turning point in the popularity of the sport in the U.S. As events unfolded, it became clear that this was not to be. 2004 Season The league consisted of eight teams in two divisions. The East division was also known as \\"The Covers\\" and the West was known as \\"The Mid Wickets\\", listed with home grounds: East Division * New York Storm (Staten Island, New York) - Richmond County Bank Ballpark * New Jersey Fire (Bridgewater, New Jersey) - Commerce Bank Ballpark * D.C. Forward (Bowie, Maryland) - Prince George's Stadium * Florida Thunder (Homestead, Florida) - Homestead Sports Complex West Division * Chicago Tornadoes (Schaumburg, Illinois)- Alexian Field, * San Francisco Freedom (San Francisco, Northern California) - Kezar Stadium * Los Angeles Unity (Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Southern California) - Arrowhead Credit Union Park * Texas Arrow Heads (Houston, Texas) - Cougar Field at the University of Houston The competition involved round-robin home and away games between all pairings within a division, followed by inter-divisional semi- finals and a final. The schedule ran from the opening game on 19 June 2004, to the final on 4 September 2004. In addition, Pro Cricket had a policy of not playing the games that have no importance to them on the points table. The game scheduled for 21 August 2004, between Chicago and Los Angeles was canceled due to the lack of importance of the game. Neither team could have made the playoffs even if they won the game; therefore, Pro Cricket chose to not play the game.

He comes from an aristocratic family from the region of Piedmont in Italy. He graduated with a degree in law from La Sapienza University in 1971. Afterward, he studied for a master's degree in international commercial law at Columbia University. He is one of the founders and former president of NTV, an Italian company which is Europe's first private open access operator of 300 km/h (186 mph) high-speed trains. In 2009, Montezemolo founded Future Italy, a free market think tank that joined Civic Choice in the 2013 Italian parliamentary election. Biography Ancestry and family background Born in Bologna, Italy, he is the youngest son of Massimo Cordero dei Marchesi di Montezemolo (1920‚Äì2009), a Piedmontese aristocrat whose family served the Royal House of Savoy for generations, and Clotilde Neri (b. 1922), niece of famed Italian surgeon Vincenzo Neri. His uncle, Admiral Giorgio Cordero dei Marchesi di Montezemolo (1918‚Äì1986) was a commander in the Regia Marina in World War II. His grandfather, Mario (1888‚Äì1960) and great-grandfather Carlo (1858‚Äì1943) were both Generals in the Italian Army. He is also a relation to Andrea Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo (his father Massimo and Andrea were cousins), who became a cardinal in 2006 and whose father, colonel Giuseppe Cordero di Montezemolo, was killed by the Wehrmacht occupation troops during the massacre of the Fosse Ardeatine in Rome in 1944. His surname is actually \\"Cordero di Montezemolo\\" and the correct usage is either the full surname or just Montezemolo (omitting the \\"di\\"); Marchesi is a noble title. Career Luca Cordero di Montezemolo in 2008 Luca Cordero di Montezemolo on Ferrari F300 Montezemolo's sporting career began at the wheel of a Giannini Fiat 500 which he raced together with his friend Cristiano Rattazzi. Later, Montezemolo briefly drove for the privately owned Lancia rally team known as HF Squadra Corse. He joined the auto manufacturing conglomerate FIAT S.p.A., headquartered in Torino, Italy, and in 1973 was moved to Ferrari, where he became Enzo Ferrari's assistant and, in 1974, manager of the Scuderia. During his involvement with the team, Ferrari won the Formula One World Championship with Niki Lauda in 1975 and 1977. In 1976 Montezemolo was promoted to become head of all FIAT racing activities, and in 1977 he advanced to become a senior manager of FIAT. Throughout the 1980s, Montezemolo occupied a number of positions in the FIAT empire, including managing director of the drinks company Cinzano and director of the publishing company Itedi. In 1982, he managed America's Cup challenge of Team Azzurra, the first Italian yacht club to enter the event. In 1985, he became manager of the Organizing Committee for 1990 World Cup Italia. In November 1991, FIAT Chairman Gianni Agnelli appointed Montezemolo president of Ferrari, which had been struggling since Enzo Ferrari's death. Montezemolo made it his personal goal to win the Formula One World Constructors' Championship once again. Montezemolo quickly made changes at the Italian team, signing up Niki Lauda as consultant and promoting Claudio Lombardi to team manager role. During the 1990s he resurrected the Ferrari road car business from heavy debts into solid profit. He also took on the presidency of Maserati when Ferrari acquired it in 1997, until 2005. Under Montezemolo and executive director Jean Todt, the Ferrari Formula One team won the World Drivers' Championship in 2000, the first time since 1979. The previous year, 1999, they had won the Constructors' Championship for the first time since 1983. Montezemolo in 2012 On 27 May 2004, Montezemolo became president of Italian business lobby Confindustria. Days later, following the death of Umberto Agnelli on 28 May, he was elected chairman of Fiat S.p.A., Ferrari's parent company. Since 20 December 2004, he has also been president of the LUISS, the Free International University for Social Studies Guido Carli in Rome. Montezemolo has often been reported to have aspirations of a career in Italian politics, most recently the office of Prime Minister, but has always denied the rumours. On 29 July 2008, Montezemolo founded the Formula One Teams Association (FOTA) which he presided over from 2008 to 2010, eventually being replaced by McLaren CEO Martin Whitmarsh. The Committee used to meet on a regular basis to discuss improvements to Formula One. FOTA was formally dissolved in 2014. In April 2010, John Elkann replaced Montezemolo as Chairman of Fiat S.p.A. On 10 September 2014, Montezemolo resigned as president and chairman of Ferrari following increasing tension with his would-be successor, FIAT Chrysler CEO, Sergio Marchionne. On 26 November 2014, Montezemolo was appointed non- executive chairman of the Board of Directors of Italian flag carrier Alitalia.Oud-topman Ferrari in raad van Alitalia ‚Äì De Telegraaf In February 2015 he became committee president of the Rome bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics.

As Nederlandsch-Indische Handelsbank  In 1863 Nederlandsch-Indische Handelsbank (English: Netherlands India Commercial Bank), which would later become Nationale Handelsbank, was established in order to finance and deal with trade between the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies. A Dutch colony that consisted of what is now Republic of Indonesia. The banks head office, located in Amsterdam, was where its branches outside of the Dutch East Indies reported to. Whereas, the branches within the Dutch colony reported to the main office in Jakarta. Between 1901 and 1950, Netherlands India Commercial Bank opened and closed various branches in countries outside of the Netherlands and Dutch East Indies. In 1901 it opened a branch in Singapore. Which until 1914 contained the main port for smaller vessels going between it and ports in the Dutch East Indies. The bank also established a branch in Hong Kong in 1906. A location that before World War 1 was a major transshipment point for raw sugar going from the Dutch East Indies to refineries in Britain. In 1920 the bank opened branches in Bombay, Calcutta, Shanghai, and Kobe to aid in cotton trading with Japan. From 1921 to 1923 branches were opened in the Japanese prefectures of Tokyo and Yokohama. Additional branches were also opened in the Chinese provinces of Amoy and Swatou. Although, in 1924 the branch in Yokohama closed after the Kanto earthquake of 1923 and the Chinese branch in Swatou closed after operating for only a few years. The bank continued expanding in the 1930 and 1940s though. In 1938 a new branch was opened in Manila and in 1948 it established a branch in Bangkok to aid with the rice, tea, shellac trades.

International Encyclopedia of Dance, vol.3, 1998, pp.362-363 By the late 1960s, he had begun to develop this dance form, which is highly choreographed with stylized gestures drawn from his childhood memories of his northern Japan home. It is this style which is most often associated with Butoh by Westerners. Life and Butoh Tatsumi Hijikata was born in 1928, March 9 in the Akita region of northern Japan, the tenth in a family of eleven children, as Yoneyama Kunio. Nanako Kurihara, Hijikata Tatsumi Chronology, Project Muse After having shuttled back and forth between Tokyo and his hometown from 1947, he moved to Tokyo permanently in 1952. He claims to have initially survived as a petty criminal through acts of burglary and robbery, but as he was known to embellish details of his life, it is not clear how much his account can be trusted. At the time, he studied tap, jazz, flamenco, ballet and German expressionist dance (Nobutoshi Tsuda). He undertook his first Ankoku Butoh performance, Kinjiki, in 1959, using a novel by Yukio Mishima as the raw input material for an abrupt, sexually-inflected act of choreographic violence which stunned its audience. At around that time, Hijikata met three figures who would be crucial collaborators for his future work: Yukio Mishima, Eikoh Hosoe, and Donald Richie. In 1962, he and his partner Motofuji Akiko established a dance studio, Asbestos Hall, in the Meguro district of Tokyo, which would be the base for his choreographic work for the rest of his life; a shifting company of young dancers gathered around him there. Hijikata conceived of Ankoku Butoh from its origins as an outlaw form of dance-art, and as constituting the negation of all existing forms of Japanese dance. Inspired by the criminality of the French novelist Jean Genet, Hijikata wrote manifestoes of his emergent dance form with such as titles as 'To Prison'. His dance would be one of corporeal extremity and transmutation, driven by an obsession with death, and imbued with an implicit repudiation of contemporary society and media power. Many of his early works were inspired by figures of European literature such as the Marquis de Sade and the Comte de Lautr√©amont, as well as by the French Surrealist movement, which had exerted an immense influence on Japanese art and literature, and had led to the creation of an autonomous and influential Japanese variant of Surrealism, whose most prominent figure was the poet Shuzo Takiguchi, who perceived Ankoku Butoh as a distinctively 'Surrealist' dance-art form. Especially at the end of the 1950s and throughout the 1960s, Hijikata undertook collaborations with filmmakers, photographers, urban architects and visual artists as an essential element of his approach to choreography's intersections with other art forms. Among the most exceptional of these collaborations was his work with the Japanese photographer Eikoh Hosoe on the book Kamaitachi, which involved a series of journeys back to northern Japan in order to embody the presence of mythical, dangerous figures at the peripheries of Japanese life. The book references stories of a supernatural being ‚Äî 'sickle-weasel' ‚Äî said to have haunted the Japanese countryside of Hosoe's childhood. In the photographs, Hijikata is seen as wandering the stark landscape and confronting farmers and children.Kamaitachi. New York: Aperture, 2006. From 1960 onward, Hijikata funded his Ankoku Butoh projects by undertaking sex-cabaret work with his company of dancers, and also acted in prominent films of the Japanese 'erotic- grotesque' horror-film genre, in such works as the director Teruo Ishii's Horror of Malformed Men and Blind Woman's Curse, in both of which Hijikata performed Ankoku Butoh sequences. Hijikata's period as a public performer and choreographer extended from his performance of Kinjiki in 1959 to his famous solo work, Hijikata Tatsumi and Japanese People: Revolt of the Body (inspired by preoccupations with the Roman Emperor Heliogabalus and the work of Hans Bellmer) in 1968, and then to his solo dances within group choreography such as Twenty-seven Nights for Four Seasons in 1972. He last appeared on stage as a guest performer in Dairakudakan's 1973 Myth of the Phallus. During the years from the late 60's through 1976, Hijikata experimented with using extensive surrealist imagery to alter movements. Then, Hijikata then gradually withdrew into the Asbestos Hall and devoted his time to writing and to training his dance-company. Throughout the period in which he had performed in public, Hijikata's work had been perceived as scandalous and the object of revulsion, part of a 'dirty avant-garde' which refused to assimilate itself to Japanese traditional art, power or society. However, Hijikata himself perceived his work as existing beyond the parameters of the era's avant-garde movements, and commented: 'I've never thought of myself as avant-garde. If you run around a race-track and are a full circuit behind everyone else, then you are alone and appear to be first. Maybe that is what happened to me...'. Hijikata's period of seclusion and silence in the Asbestos Hall allowed him to mesh his Ankoku Butoh preoccupations with his memories of childhood in northern Japan, one result of which was the publication of a hybrid book-length text on memory and corporeal transformation, entitled Ailing Dancer (1983); he also compiled scrapbooks in which he annotated art-images cut from magazines with fragmentary reflections on corporeality and dance. By the mid-1980s, Hijikata was emerging from his long period of withdrawal, in particular by choreographing work for the dancer Kazuo Ohno, with whom he had begun working in the early 1960s, and whose work had become a prominent public manifestation of Butoh, despite deep divisions in the respective preoccupations of Hijikata and Ohno. During Hijikata's seclusion, Butoh had begun to attract worldwide attention. Hijikata envisaged performing in public again, and developed new projects, but died abruptly from liver failure in January 1986, at the age of 57. Asbestos Hall, which had operated as a drinking club and film venue as well as a dance studio, was eventually sold-off and converted into a private house in the 2000s, but Hijikata's film works, scrapbooks and other artefacts were eventually collected in the form of an archive, at Keio University in Tokyo. Hijikata remains a vital figure of inspiration, in Japan and worldwide, not only for choreographers and performers, but also for visual artists, filmmakers, writers, musicians, architects, and digital artists. Origins of Butoh The first butoh piece, Kinjiki (Forbidden Colours) by Tatsumi Hijikata, premiered at a dance festival in 1959. It was based on the novel of the same name by Yukio Mishima. It explored the taboo of homosexuality and ended with a live chicken being smothered between the legs of Kazuo Ohno's son Yoshito Ohno, after which Hijikata chasing Yoshito off the stage in darkness. Mainly as a result of the audience outrage over this piece,Hijikata was banned from the festival, establishing him as an iconoclast. The earliest butoh performances were called (in English) \\"Dance Experience.\\" In the early 1960s, Hijikata used the term \\"Ankoku-Buyou\\" (ÊöóÈªíËàûË∏ä ‚Äì dance of darkness) to describe his dance. He later changed the word \\"buyo,\\" filled with associations of Japanese classical dance, to \\"butoh,\\" a long-discarded word for dance that originally meant European ballroom dancing.\\"\\"Apoptosis in White: A butoh-fu in memory of Hijikata Tatsumi \\", by Fulya Peker. (English) Featured in Hyperion: On the Future of Aesthetics, Vol. V, Issue 1, May 2010. In later work, Hijikata continued to subvert conventional notions of dance. Inspired by writers such as Yukio Mishima (as noted above), Lautr√©amont, Artaud, Genet and de Sade, he delved into grotesquerie, darkness, and decay. At the same time, Hijikata explored the transmutation of the human body into other forms, such as those of animals. He also developed a poetic and surreal choreographic language, butoh-fu (fu means \\"word\\" in Japanese), to help the dancer transform into other states of being. Sources * Baird, Bruce.

He previously served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1990 to 2003, and was a cabinet minister in the provincial government of Bob Rae. Christopherson is a member of the New Democratic Party. Early life and career Christopherson was born in Hamilton, Ontario. He is self- educated, having dropped out of high school in the ninth grade. A voracious reader, he is a particular fan of books on politics. He began working with International Harvester in Hamilton at age 19, and remained with the company for eleven years. He was active with the United Auto Workers union, becoming plant chairman in 1978 and president of the Local 525 in 1979.Jill Morrison, \\"Great expectations\\", Hamilton Spectator, 13 February 1993, B3. Christopherson campaigned in Hamilton East in the 1984 federal election, finishing second against Liberal candidate Sheila Copps. He was elected to Hamilton, Ontario City Council the following year for the city's fourth ward, and re-elected in 1988. Christopherson became chairman of Hamilton's licensing committee, and made a concerted effort to reform the city's notorious regulatory practices.Terry Cooke, \\"Licensing mess could consume council term\\", Hamilton Spectator, 10 February 2007, A19. He developed a reputation on as a hard worker, and was one of three councillors to decline a pay increase in 1988.\\"3 Hamilton aldermen refuse pay raise\\", Globe and Mail, 28 April 1988, A22.

Provincial politics Government backbencher Christopherson was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1990 provincial election, defeating Liberal cabinet minister Lily Oddie Munro in Hamilton Centre as the NDP won a majority government across the province.

Cabinet minister Christopherson was respected by all parties for his legislative work ethic and contributions to the Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs, and was widely considered as one of the most skilled backbenchers in the government caucus.Emilia Cassella, \\"Christopherson touted for NDP cabinet shuffle\\", Hamilton Spectator, 14 August 1992, A1. There was little surprise when he was appointed to cabinet as Minister of Correctional Services on September 23, 1992, notwithstanding that Hamilton already had three representatives in cabinet. Christopherson's portfolio was extremely challenging, and was described by one journalist as \\"one of the worst jobs in government\\". The Correctional Services ministry had previously been damaged by reports of sexual abuse and intimidation involving staff at Ontario jails and training centres, and Christopherson was required to enact substantial internal reforms.Richard Mackie, \\"Critics brand cabinet shuffle 'damage control'\\", Globe and Mail, 24 September 1992, A7 and \\"Hiring, Property and Internal Investigations\\", Hamilton Spectator, 22 July 1993, B4.

On February 3, 1993, Christopherson was given additional cabinet responsibilities as Solicitor General of Ontario.\\"Rae shuffles deck\\", Hamilton Spectator, 3 February 1993, A1. This was also a difficult portfolio, and Christopherson has since acknowledged that relations between the Rae government and Ontario police services were extremely tense when he entered the ministry. He has been credited with improving this situation, winning the respect of many in the police community. Julian Fantino, then an executive member of the Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police, commented that there was \\"marked improvement\\" in relations following Christopherson's appointment.Richard Brennan, \\"Street smarts\\", Hamilton Spectator, 28 December 1994, B3.

Christopherson also introduced new guidelines for targeting hate crimes, and mandated stricter standards for police investigations of spousal assault.\\"Guidelines on hate crimes issued\\", Globe and Mail, 23 July 1993, A4; \\"Hate crime, wife assault crackdown launched\\", Financial Post, 20 January 1994, p. 55. Early in 1995, he announced that police would soon be given the right to warn the general public about sex offenders released into residential neighbourhoods.\\"Sex offender warnings\\", Globe and Mail, 10 February 1995, A2. In May 1994, Christopherson introduced a pilot project to reduce illegal gun ownership in Ontario. For a three-month period, Ontarians were permitted to turn over illegal or unwanted firearms to the police without risking prosecution for illegal possession. The policy was endorsed by the police community.Amber Nasrulla, \\"Firearms amnesty launched\\", Globe and Mail, 17 May 1994, A4 and Ross Longbottom, \\"Amnesty for guns way to safer streets\\", Hamilton Spectator, 17 May 1994, B3. After three months, the ministry announced that 1,000 pistols and revolvers, 2,000 rifles and shotguns and over 150,000 rounds of ammunition had been turned over to the police.\\"Success of province-wide firearms program\\", Canada NewsWire, 1 September 1994. In addition to his official cabinet portfolios, Christopherson was also responsible for articulating the Rae government's strategy for the proposed Red Hill Creek Expressway in Hamilton. Although he had previously opposed the project for environmental and other reasons, Christopherson argued in 1994 that a scaled-back four-lane highway would be the \\"best possible compromise\\" under the circumstances.Emilia Cassella, \\"Too little, too late say PCs, Grits\\", Hamilton Spectator, 3 March 1994, B2; Sharon Oosthoek, \\"Friends of valley road embrace\\", Hamilton Spectator, 22 March 1994, B1. The Rae government approved the plan, although it was later rejected by the succeeding ministry. Christopherson was widely respected for his abilities in cabinet, and often won praise from members of the opposition. Progressive Conservative Bob Runciman credited him for his competence and managerial skills, while Liberal Tim Murphy described him as \\"the best of a bad bunch\\". He served until the defeat of the Rae government in 1995. Cabinet positions Opposition member The Rae government was defeated in the 1995 election, falling to only seventeen seats out of 130. Christopherson, still personally popular, was narrowly re-elected for Hamilton Centre. He served in the next legislature as NDP critic for labour issues and the Workers' Compensation Board.Lee Prokaska, \\"Critics lambast WCB cuts\\", Hamilton Spectator, 26 July 1995, B3. Rae resigned as party leader in 1996, and there was considerable media speculation that Christopherson would run to succeed him. Toronto Star journalist Thomas Walkom indicated that he would be a powerful candidate on the centrist wing of the party, and would likely win the support of pro-Rae trade unions such as the Steelworkers.Thomas Walkom, \\"NDP needs an identity as well as a leader\\", Toronto Star, 16 January 1996, A15. He decided against running and gave his support to Howard Hampton, the eventual winner.\\"Hampton to seek NDP leadership\\", Globe and Mail, 20 February 1996, A11. Christopherson was a prominent supporter of Hamilton's amalgamation with neighbouring municipalities in the late 1990s.\\"Just one MPP opposes H-W supercity\\", Hamilton Spectator, 4 December 1996, A11. The policy, which was supported by some members of all three major parties, was enacted by the Progressive Conservative government of Mike Harris in 2000. Christopherson considered leaving politics to run for the leadership of the Ontario Federation of Labour in 1997, but ultimately declined.\\"Race for top post reveals crack in house of labour\\", Toronto Star, 1 November 1997, p. 1. The Hamilton Centre riding was eliminated by redistribution in 1996, and Christopherson chose to contest the expanded riding of Hamilton West for the 1999 provincial election against incumbent Progressive Conservative Lillian Ross. He was re-elected, and became one of only nine New Democrats returned to the reduced 103-seat legislature. He served as his party's Finance and Labour Critic, and was appointed as House Leader.\\"Hampton announces critic portfolios\\", Canada NewsWire, 28 June 1999, 15:14 report. He considered campaigning for Mayor of Hamilton in 2000, but reluctantly declined.Eric Mcguinness, \\"Morrow throws his hat into the ring\\", Hamilton Spectator, 31 May 2000, A01. Christopherson resigned as NDP House Leader in 2001, amid rumours of a rift with Hampton.Richard Brennan, \\"Signs of rift in NDP as house leader quits\\", 19 April 2001, A11. He continued to serve as his party's critic for Consumer and Business Services and the Management Board of Cabinet, and was a deputy speaker in the legislature from 2001 to 2003. Mayoral campaign Christopherson did not seek re-election to the legislature in 2003. He instead campaigned for mayor of Hamilton in that year's municipal campaign. He promised to reform the city's disclosure laws, requiring municipal politicians to declare their assets, debts and holdings.Chinta Puxley, \\"Mayoral hopeful pushes disclosure rule\\", Hamilton Spectator, 16 June 2003. He also spoke out against plans to build an incinerator in the city for waste disposal.Fred Vallance-Jones, \\"Incinerator fuels mayoral clash\\", Hamilton Spectator, 8 September 2003, A04. He was supported by two teachers' unions and the city firefighters' union, as well as by Liberal MPP Dominic Agostino from Hamilton East. Initially considered the frontrunner, he was ultimately defeated by rival candidate Larry Di Ianni. Hamilton's amalgamation with the more right-leaning suburbs was a factor, as was Christopherson's opposition to a revised Red Hill Expressway.\\"Expressway dispute\\", Broadcast News, 12 November 2003, 03:24 report. Federal politician Christopherson returned to political life a few months later, defeating Liberal cabinet minister Stan Keyes to win the Hamilton Centre riding in the 2004 federal election. The Liberal Party won a minority government, and Christopherson served as NDP critic for cities, community infrastructure, labour and steel policy in the 38th parliament. He was part of a Canadian delegation that observed presidential elections in Ukraine in late 2004.\\"Hamilton New Democrat M-P David Christopherson is heading to Ukraine for Christmas\\", Broadcast News, 17 December 2004, 03:58 report. He was re-elected in the 2006 federal election with an increased majority, as the Conservatives won a minority government nationally. In May 2006, he called for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police rather than the government to investigate a leak of the Auditor General's report into the Canadian gun registry. Christopherson suspected that someone connected to the government may have been responsible for the leak, given its \\"self-serving\\" nature.\\"Who leaked Fraser's report? Harper to probe\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 13 May 2006, A11. He has also criticized the previous Liberal government for allowing billions in unpaid tax monies to remain uncollected.Carly Weeks, \\"Agency lets billions in tax money slip away: Problems reported in 1994 never fixed\\", Ottawa Citizen, 17 May 2006, A5. Christopherson was re-elected to his federal seat again in the 2008 federal election, and the 2011 federal election. Christopherson is often described as a pragmatic politician. He once said that he has never been a \\"hard-line ideologue\\", but \\"the NDP is where I'm most comfortable.\\" He was appointed Defence Critic for the NDP after Jack Layton's death, and appointed one of the three deputy leaders, by Layton's successor Thomas Mulcair. After the 2015 federal election, Christopherson was appointed as the NDP's critic for the Planning and Priorities Committee and for Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness. Christopherson was involved in the so-called 'Elbowgate' political confrontation on 18 May 2016. Video of the floor of the House of Commons appears to show the MP moving from side to side impeding the path of Conservative whip, Gord Brown MP. Planned retirement On July 5, 2018, Christopherson announced his plan to retirehttp://davidchristopherson.ndp.ca/message-from-david-christopherson at the end of the 42nd Canadian Parliament, and to not seek re-election in the 2019 federal election. \\"It has been my distinct honour to have served as the councillor for Ward 4, the Member of Provincial Parliament for Hamilton Centre and now as the federal Member of Parliament for Hamilton Centre,\\" Christopherson wrote in his statement. \\"I truly love our city and the people who call it home. To have earned the trust and confidence of the people of Hamilton for so many years is truly humbling and I am grateful to have had the opportunity to join with so many dedicated people working to help build a stronger, more fair and diverse community.\\" Electoral record Electors could vote for two candidates.

While living with an uncle in Canada after his father died, Wood was conscripted into the Canadian Army at the outset of the War of 1812, but escaped across Lake Ontario and briefly served in the Vermont militia. Career Wood moved to Cleveland, Ohiothen a tiny village of 600 residentsin 1818 with his wife and infant daughter. He reputedly arrived with only $1.25 left to his name to work as a lawyer. He served in the Ohio State Senate from 1825 to 1830. In 1830, he was elected President Judge of the third judicial circuit. He served on the Common Pleas Court bench from 1830 to 1833. Wood was elected in 1833 to the Ohio Supreme Court, and served two seven-year terms from 1833 to 1847. He was defeated in a bid for a third term by a Whig candidate. He took office in late 1850 as governor. His first term was cut short by the implementation of a new state constitution, and he was re-elected in late 1851, re-inaugurated in early 1852. He resigned on July 13, 1853 to take a position as the American consul in Valpara√≠so, Chile. He remained there until 1855, when he retired to Cleveland.

This covers the period of the Notre-Dame school of polyphony (the use of multiple, simultaneous, independent melodic lines), and the subsequent years which saw the early development of the motet, a highly varied choral musical composition. Usually the term \\"ars antiqua\\" is restricted to sacred (church) or polyphonic music, excluding the secular (non- religious) monophonic songs of the troubadours, and trouv√®res. However, sometimes the term \\"ars antiqua\\" is used more loosely to mean all European music of the thirteenth century, and from slightly before. The term ars antiqua is used in opposition to ars nova (meaning \\"new art\\", \\"new technique\\" or \\"new style\\"), which refers to the period of musical activity between approximately 1310 and 1375. History P√©rotin, one of the few composers of \\"Ars Antiqua\\" who is known by name, composed this Alleluia nativitas in the third rhythmic mode. The original Middle Ages uses of the expression, found in the Speculum Musice of Jacobus and once by Johannes de Muris (the only one to use the exact term \\"ars antiqua\\"), referred specifically to the period of Franco of Cologne, approximately 1250‚Äì1310, but this restricted usage is rarely employed in modern scholarship. Almost all composers of the ars antiqua are anonymous. L√©onin (fl. late 12th century), and P√©rotin (fl. c.1180 - c.1220) were the two composers known by name from the Notre Dame school; in the subsequent period, Petrus de Cruce, a composer of motets, is one of the few whose name has been preserved. In music theory the ars antiqua period saw several advances over previous practice, most of them in conception, and notation of rhythm. In the early Medieval music era, notation indicated the pitches of songs without indicating the rhythm that these notes should be sung in. The most famous music theorist of the first half of the 13th century, Johannes de Garlandia, was the author of the De Mensurabili Musica (about 1240), the treatise which defined, and most completely elucidated the rhythmic modes. A German theorist of a slightly later period, Franco of Cologne, was the first to describe a system of notation in which differently shaped notes have entirely different rhythmic values (in the Ars cantus mensurabilis of approximately 1280), an innovation which had a massive impact on the subsequent history of European music. Most of the surviving notated music of the 13th century uses the rhythmic modes as defined by Garlandia. The early Gothic includes the French music composed in the Notre-Dame school up until about 1260, and the high Gothic all the music between then, and about 1310 or 1320, the conventional beginning of the ars nova. The forms of organum and conductus reached their peak development in the early Gothic, and began to decline in the high Gothic, being replaced by the motet. Though the style of the ars antiqua went out of fashion rather suddenly in the first two decades of the fourteenth century, it had a late defender in Jacques of Li√®ge (alternatively known as Jacob of Li√®ge), who wrote a violent attack on the \\"irreverent, and corrupt\\" ars nova in his Speculum Musicae (c.1320) vigorously defending the old style in a manner suggestive of any number of music critics from the Middle Ages to the present day. To Jacques, the ars antiqua was the musica modesta, and the ars nova was a musica lasciva--a kind of music which he considered to be excessively indulgent, capricious, immodest, and sensual.

The first vertebrate paleontologist on the West Coast of the United States, he is best known for his taxonomy of vertebrate fossils at the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, particularly with the genus Smilodon, more commonly known as the sabertooth cat. He is also known for his work to extend the reach of the National Park Service. Biography He was born in Hopkinton, Iowa, the eldest child of postmaster, store proprietor, and American Civil War veteran Charles E. Merriam. His middle name Campbell was his mother's middle name, and the maiden name of his maternal grandmother. Both his father Charles E. Merriam and his paternal uncle Henry C. Merriam had served as officers in the 12th Iowa Infantry, Company K; after capture at the Battle of Shiloh, they were sent to Libby Prison for some time before being returned to the battlefields. Eventually, when the two brothers were mustered out, they returned to Iowa, married, and raised families. It seems that John Campbell Merriam may not have had a close relationship with his brother Charles E. Merriam Jr. (five years younger), who went on to University of Chicago as a political scientist and founder of the Social Science Research Council. Certainly, their intellectual trajectories were quite distinct: while Charles was a hardball political scientist, John Campbell was a paleontologist whose science verged into Christian mystical teleology (see Stock). Both John Campbell Merriam and his brother Charles E. Merriam Jr. spent their later years in Washington, D.C., where they influenced national policies in their chosen fields. As a young man, he began collecting Paleozoic invertebrate fossils near his Iowa home. He received a bachelor's degree from Lenox College in Hopkinton, Iowa, his father's alma mater, then went to the University of California to study geology and botany under Joseph Le Conte. He later went to Munich, Germany, to study under the famous paleontologist Karl von Zittel. In 1894 he returned to the U.S. and joined the faculty at the University of California, teaching and performing research in both vertebrate and invertebrate paleontology. In 1901 one of his lectures on paleontology inspired the young Annie Montague Alexander, who financed and took part in his expedition that year to Fossil Lake in Oregon. Alexander, who went on to a lifelong career as a paleontological benefactress, financed his subsequent expeditions to Mount Shasta in 1902 and 1903, as well as his famous 1905 Saurian Expedition to the West Humboldt Range in Nevada. During this expedition Merriam unearthed 25 specimens of ichthyosaur, many of them considered the finest ever found. In 1903 he was recognized as an Associate Member of the Boone and Crockett Club, a wildlife conservation organization founded in 1887 by Theodore Roosevelt and George Bird Grinnell. In 1912 he was appointed chairman of the Department of Paleontology at the University of California. That same year he began his famous studies of vertebrates at the La Brea Tar Pits. He and his students categorized many of the vertebrate fossils found at the site, and many more were placed in storage. The smilodon was later established as the California state fossil. In 1918 he co-founded the Save the Redwoods League, which began significant preservation efforts after Merriam traveled the Redwood areas of Humboldt County, California in 1922 seeking to spare its old-growth the effects of logging he witnessed in Redwood forests closer to San Francisco. A biography, which details his efforts to preserve wild lands in California and throughout the United States, was published in 2005. In 1919, Merriam served as president of the Geological Society of America.Fairchild, Herman LeRoy, 1932, The Geological Society of America 1888-1930, a Chapter in Earth Science History: New York, The Geological Society of America, 232 p.Eckel, Edwin, 1982, GSA Memoir 155, The Geological Society of America ‚Äî Life History of a Learned Society: Boulder, Colorado, Geological Society of America Memoir 155, 168 p., . In 1920 he was appointed Dean of Faculty at the University of California, Berkeley, but he left that same year to become president of the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C.. His departure caused the university to combine the Paleontology Department with the Geology Department, angering Merriam's benefactress, Annie Alexander, who subsequently founded and endowed the university's Museum of Paleontology. As the head of Carnegie Institution, Merriam's administrative duties led to a reduction in his research for the rest of his career. He accomplishments as president included helping to advance the educational programs of the National Park Service, as well as helping to preserve the California redwoods. His published papers are collected in a four-volume set published in 1938 by the Carnegie Institution. Merriam was a founding member of the Galton Institute and a cautious political supporter of eugenics. Notably, his paternal first cousin Frank Merriam, the eldest child of Civil War veteran Henry C. Merriam, served as the 28th Governor of California between 1934 and 1939. Education and University Degrees Bachelor of Science, Lenox College, 1887. PhD, University of Munich, 1893.

It is a chess tactic which seldom arises, and is therefore often overlooked. Opportunities for interference are rare because the defended object must be more valuable than the sacrificed piece, and the interposition must itself represent a threat.Interference definitions and examples Examples In the position at left, White to play will apparently be obliged to retreat the knight from f5, because the squares to which it could advance are all guarded. However, the interference move 1.Nd6+ interrupts the black rook's defense of the black queen. If Black plays either 1...cxd6 or 1...Bxd6, White will capture Black's queen. Therefore, Black has no better play than 1...Rxd6 2.exd6 Qxe2 3.Rxe2 Bxd6, conceding the exchange for a pawn. A more subtle example of interference occurs when the interposing piece interrupts two lines simultaneously. In this case, the moving piece does not have to pose a threat by itself. Instead, it makes the opponent trip over his own feet, so to speak, because capturing the offending piece will necessarily break one line of defense or the other. In the position at right, White is at a material disadvantage, and apparently can't queen the a-pawn because the black bishop guards the queening square. However, 1.Nd5! interferes with the bishop and with the black rooks' defense of each other. If 1...Bxd5, 2.Rxd8 is crushing. Also, if 1.Nd5 is answered by 1...R8xd5, it would allow 2.Rh8 mate. The best Black can do is 1...R2xd5, interfering with the bishop's guard of a8 and allowing 2.a8=Q. Although interferences are quite rare in actual play, they are a common theme in chess problems. The device in the last example above, in which a sacrifice occurs on the intersection of the defensive lines of two differently moving pieces, is known to problemists as a Novotny. Various other types of interference are given specific names in problem terminology, including the Grimshaw, Plachutta where the two pieces both move orthogonally (see a beautiful example by Tarrasch), Anti-Bristol, Holzhausen and Wurzburg- Plachutta.

He was convicted at trial and sentenced to death, but the sentence was later overturned due to issues with jury selection at his trial. Speck died of a heart attack in 1991, after 25 years in prison. In 1996, videotapes featuring Speck were shown before the Illinois State Legislature to highlight some of the illegal activity that took place in prisons.  Early life and crimes   Childhood  Richard Benjamin Speck was born in Kirkwood, Illinois, the seventh of eight children of Benjamin Franklin Speck and Mary Margaret Carbaugh. The family moved to Monmouth, Illinois, shortly after Speck's birth. Speck and his younger sister Carolyn (b. 1943) were much younger than their four older sisters and two older brothers. Speck's eldest brother, Robert, died at the age of 23 in an automobile accident in 1952. Speck's father worked as a packer at Western Stoneware in Monmouth and had previously worked as a farmer and logger. Speck was very close to his father, who died in 1947 from a heart attack at the age of 53. Speck was six years old at the time. A few years later, Speck's religious, teetotaler mother fell in love with a traveling insurance salesman from Texas, Carl August Rudolph Lindberg, whom she met on a train trip to Chicago. The hard-drinking Lindberg, with a 25-year criminal record that started with forgery and included several arrests for drunk driving, was the opposite of Speck's sober, hardworking father. Speck's mother married Lindberg on May 10, 1950, in Palo Pinto, Texas. Speck and his younger sister Carolyn stayed with their married sister Sara Thornton in Monmouth for a few months so Speck could finish second grade, before joining their mother and Lindberg in rural Santo, Texas, west of Fort Worth, Texas, where Speck attended third grade.  Dallas, 1951‚Äì1966  After a year in Santo, Speck moved with his mother, stepfather, and sister Carolyn to the East Dallas section of Dallas, Texas, living at ten addresses in poor neighborhoods over the next dozen years. Speck loathed his often drunk and frequently absent stepfather, who psychologically abused him with insults and threats. Speck, a poor student who needed glasses for reading but refused to wear them, struggled through Dallas public schools from fourth through eighth grade, repeating the eighth grade at J. L. Long Jr. High School, in part because he refused to speak in class because of a lifelong fear of people staring at him. In autumn 1957, Speck started ninth grade at Crozier Technical High School, but failed every subject and did not return for the second semester in January 1958, dropping out just after his 16th birthday. Speck started drinking alcohol at age 12 and by age 15 he was getting drunk almost every day. His first arrest, in 1955 at age 13 for trespassing, was followed by dozens of other arrests for misdemeanors over the next eight years. Speck worked as a laborer for the 7-Up bottling company in Dallas for almost three years, from 1960 to 1963. In October 1961, Speck met 15-year-old Shirley Annette Malone at the Texas State Fair. She became pregnant after three weeks of dating him. Shirley married Speck on January 19, 1962, and initially moved in with him, his mother, sister Carolyn, and Carolyn's husband. Speck's mother and stepfather had separated, and his stepfather had moved to California. Speck stopped using the name Richard Benjamin Lindberg when he got married and began using the name Richard Benjamin Speck. When their daughter, Robbie Lynn Speck was born on July 5, 1962, Malone did not know that Speck was serving a 22-day jail sentence for disturbing the peace in McKinney, Texas, after a drunken melee. In July 1963, Speck was caught after he forged and cashed a co-worker's $44 paycheck. He also robbed a grocery store, making away with cigarettes, beer and $3 in cash. The 21-year-old Speck was convicted of forgery and burglary and sentenced to three years in prison. He was paroled after serving 16 months from 1963 to 1965 in the Texas State Penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas. One week after his parole, on January 9, 1965, Speck was wielding a carving knife when he attacked a woman in the parking lot of her apartment building. He fled when the woman screamed. The police arrived within minutes and apprehended Speck a few blocks away. Speck was convicted of aggravated assault, given a 16-month sentence to run concurrently with a parole violation sentence, and returned to prison in Huntsville, but due to an error he was released just six months later on completion of his parole violation sentence on July 2, 1965. After his release from prison, Speck worked for three months as a driver for the Patterson Meat Company and had six accidents with his truck before he was fired for failing to show up for work. In December 1965, on the recommendation of his mother, Speck (who was by then separated from Malone) moved in with a 29-year-old divorced woman, an ex-professional wrestler who was a bartender at his favorite bar, Ginny's Lounge, and needed someone to babysit her three children. In January 1966, Malone filed for divorce. That same month, Speck stabbed a man in a knife fight at Ginny's Lounge. He was charged with aggravated assault, but a defense attorney hired by his mother was able to get the charge reduced to disturbing the peace. Speck was fined $10 and jailed for three days after he failed to pay the fine. This was the last time Speck was in police custody in Dallas. On March 5, 1966, Speck bought a 12-year-old car. The following evening, he robbed a grocery store, stole 70 cartons of cigarettes, sold them out of the trunk of his car in the grocery store's parking lot, and then abandoned the car. The police traced the car to Speck and issued a warrant for his arrest for burglary on March 8. An arrest (his 42nd in Dallas) would mean another prison term, so on March 9, 1966, Speck's sister Carolyn drove him to the Dallas bus depot, where he took a bus to Chicago, Illinois.  Monmouth, March‚ÄìApril 1966  Speck stayed with his sister Martha Thornton and her family in Chicago for a few days, and then returned to his boyhood hometown of Monmouth, Illinois, where he initially stayed with some old family friends. Speck's brother Howard was a carpenter in Monmouth and found a job for him sanding plasterboard for another Monmouth carpenter. Speck became angry when he learned his ex-wife had remarried two days after she was granted a divorce on March 16, 1966. He moved to the Christy Hotel in downtown Monmouth on March 25 and spent most of his time in the downtown taverns. At the end of March, while Speck and some acquaintances were on a bar-hopping trip to Gulfport Illinois they were detained overnight by police there after Speck reportedly threatened a man in a tavern restroom with his knife. On April 3, Mrs. Virgil Harris, a 65-year-old resident of Monmouth, returned home at 1:00 a.m. to find a burglar in her house brandishing a knife. He was a 6-foot-tall white man who was \\"very polite\\" and spoke \\"very softly with a Southern drawl.\\" The man blindfolded her, tied her up, raped her, ransacked her house, and stole the $2.50 she had earned babysitting that evening. A week later, Mary Kathryn Pierce, a 32-year-old barmaid who worked at her brother-in-law's tavern, Frank's Place, in downtown Monmouth, was last seen leaving the tavern at 12:20 a.m. on April 9. She was reported missing on April 13, and her body was found that day in an empty hog house behind the tavern. She had died from a blow to her abdomen that ruptured her liver. Speck had frequented Frank's Place, and the empty hog house was one of several he had helped build in the preceding month, so Monmouth police briefly questioned him about Pierce's death when he showed up to collect his final carpentry paycheck on April 15 and asked him to stay in town for further questioning. When police showed up at the Christy Hotel on April 19 to continue questioning Speck, they discovered he had left the hotel a few hours earlier, carrying his suitcases and saying he was just going to the laundromat. He had instead left town. A search of his room turned up a radio and costume jewelry Mrs. Virgil Harris had reported missing from her house, as well as items reported missing in two other local burglaries in the past month.  Chicago, April‚ÄìJune 1966  On April 19, 1966, Speck returned to stay at his sister Martha's second-floor apartment at 3966 N. Avondale Ave. in the Old Irving Park neighborhood on the Northwest side of Chicago, where she lived with her husband, Gene Thornton, and their two teenage daughters. Martha had worked as a registered nurse in pediatrics before she was married and her husband Gene worked nights as a railroad switchman. Speck told them an unbelievable story about having to leave Monmouth after refusing to sell narcotics for a \\"crime syndicate\\" there. Gene Thornton, who had served in the U.S. Navy, thought that the U.S. Merchant Marine might provide a suitable occupation for his unemployed brother-in-law, so on April 25 he took Speck to the U.S. Coast Guard office to apply for a letter of authority to work as an apprentice seaman. The application required being fingerprinted and photographed, and having a physical examination by a doctor. Speck found work immediately after obtaining the letter of authority, joining the 33-member crew of Inland Steel's Clarence B. Randall, an L6-S-B1 class bulk ore lake freighter, on April 30. Speck's first voyage on the Clarence B. Randall was brief, since he was stricken with appendicitis on May 3, and was evacuated by U.S. Coast Guard helicopter to St. Joseph's Hospital in Hancock, Michigan, on the Keweenaw Peninsula of Michigan's Upper Peninsula where he had an emergency appendectomy. After he was discharged from the hospital, Speck returned to stay with his sister Martha and her family in Chicago to recuperate. On May 20, he rejoined the crew of the Clarence B. Randall on which he served until June 14, when he got drunk and quarreled with one of the boat's officers and was put ashore on June 15. For the following week, Speck stayed at the St. Elmo, an East Side, Chicago flophouse at E. 99th St. & S. Ewing Ave. Speck then traveled by train to Houghton, Michigan, staying at the Douglas House, to visit Judy Laakaniemi, a 28-year-old nurse's aide going through a divorce, whom he had befriended at St. Joseph's Hospital. On June 27, after Judy gave him $80 to help him until he found work, Speck left to again stay with his sister Martha and her family in Chicago for the next two weeks. On June 30, Speck's brother-in-law Gene drove him to the National Maritime Union (NMU) hiring hall at 2335 E. 100th St. in the Jeffery Manor neighborhood of South Deering, Chicago to file his paperwork for a seaman's card. The NMU hiring hall was one block east of five attached two-story brick townhouses, three of which were occupied by South Chicago Community Hospital senior student nurses and Filipino exchange registered nurses. Eight of these nurses lived in the easternmost townhouse at 2319 E. 100th St., just from the NMU hiring hall.  Chicago, July 1966  On Friday, July 8, 1966, Speck's brother-in-law Gene drove him to the NMU hiring hall to pick up his seaman's card and register for a berth on a ship. Speck lost out that day to a seaman with more seniority for a berth on the SS Flying Spray, a C1-A cargo ship bound for South Vietnam, and returned to his sister Martha's apartment for the weekend. By Monday, July 11, Speck had outstayed his welcome with his sister Martha and her family. After packing his bags and again being driven by his brother-in-law to the NMU hiring hall to await a berth on a ship, Speck stayed the night at Pauline's rooming house, about away at 3028 E. 96th St., in the Vets Park neighborhood of South Deering, Chicago. On Tuesday, July 12, Speck returned to the NMU hiring hall. In mid-afternoon, he received an assignment on Sinclair Oil's tanker SS Sinclair Great Lakes, which was a 30-minute drive away in East Chicago, Indiana. When he arrived there, he found that his spot had already been taken, and he was driven back to the NMU hiring hall, which was then closed. Speck did not have enough money for a rooming house, so he dropped his bags off six blocks east at the Manor Shell filling station at 9954 S. Torrence Ave. and slept in an unfinished house just off E. 103rd St. On Wednesday, July 13, Speck picked up his bags and checked in at the NMU hiring hall. He was angry for being sent to a non-existent assignment, and he talked for 30 minutes in the car with his sister Martha and her husband Gene, who had driven down to visit him at 9 a.m. They parked on E. 100th St. next to Luella Elementary School, across the street from the townhouses where the nurses lived. At 10:30 a.m., he was tired of waiting at the NMU hiring hall for a job. Speck had $25 that his sister had given him, and he left and walked about east on E. 100th St. to check in at the Shipyard Inn at E. 101st St. & S. Avenue N; the inn was an East Side, Chicago rooming house. Speck spent the rest of the day drinking in nearby taverns before he accosted Ella Mae Hooper at knifepoint; she was a 53-year-old woman who had spent the day drinking at the same taverns that Speck had patronized. Speck took her to his room at the Shipyard Inn, raped her, and stole her black $16 mail-order .22 caliber R√∂hm pistol.Breo & Martin (1993), pp. 23‚Äì24: \\"Ella Mae had obtained the .22 caliber black Rohm pistol for $16 from a mail-order house in West Virginia...and it was delivered to her by parcel post on March 10, 1966\\". After dinner at the nearby Kay's Pilot House, Speck returned to drink at the Shipyard Inn's tavern until 10:20 p.m., when he left dressed entirely in black, armed with a switchbladeBreo & Martin (1993), pp. 199‚Äì200: possibly a $4.75 black-handled Schrade Walden \\"Improved Muskrat\\" switchblade with 23/4\\" and 23/16\\" blades. and Ella Mae Hooper's handgun, and walked about west on E. 100th St. to the nurses' townhouse at 2319 E. 100th St. Murder of eight student nurses At 11 p.m. on July 13, 1966, Speck broke into the 2319 E. 100th St townhouse in Chicago's Jeffery Manor neighborhood; the townhouse was functioning as a dormitory for student nurses. He entered and, using only a knife, killed Gloria Davy, Patricia Matusek, Nina Jo Schmale, Pamela Wilkening, Suzanne Farris, Mary Ann Jordan, Merlita Gargullo and Valentina Pasion. Speck, who later claimed he was both drunk and high on drugs, may have originally planned to commit a routine burglary.Fornek, Scott. all dead!': 40 years ago this week, Richard Speck killed 8\\". Chicago Sun-Times. July 9, 2006. Speck held the women in a room for hours, leading them out one by one, stabbing or strangling each to death, then finally raping and strangling his last victim, Gloria Davy. One woman, Corazon Amurao, escaped death because she crawled and hid under a bed while Speck was out of the room. Speck possibly lost count or might have known eight women lived in the townhouse but was unaware that a ninth woman was spending the night. Amurao stayed hidden until almost 6 a.m. Fingerprints found at the scene were matched to Speck. Two days after the murders, Speck was identified by a drifter named Claude Lunsford. Speck, Lunsford, and another man had been drinking the evening of July 15 on the fire escape of the Starr Hotel at 617 W. Madison. On July 16, Lunsford recognized a sketch of the murderer in the evening paper and phoned the police at 9:30 p.m. after finding Speck in his (Lunsford's) room at the Starr Hotel. The police, however, did not respond to the call although their records showed the call had been made. Speck then attempted suicide, and the Starr Hotel desk clerk phoned in the emergency around midnight. Speck was taken to Cook County Hospital at 12:30 a.m. on July 17. At the hospital, Speck was recognized by Dr. LeRoy Smith, a 25-year-old surgical resident physician, who had read about the \\"Born To Raise Hell\\" tattoo in a newspaper story. The police were called. Speck was arrested.Fornek, Scott. \\"Dogged detectives, alert physician nailed Speck\\". Chicago Sun-Times. July 10, 2006. Reprint. Concerns over the recent Miranda case that had vacated the convictions of a number of criminals meant Speck was not even questioned for three weeks after his arrest. Pre-trial Felony Court Judge Herbert J. Paschen appointed an impartial panel to report on Speck's competence to stand trial and his sanity at the time of the crime ‚Äì a panel of three physicians suggested by the defense and three physicians selected by the prosecution, consisting of five psychiatrists and one general surgeon. The panel's confidential report deemed Speck competent to stand trial and concluded he had not been insane at the time of the murders. While awaiting trial, Speck participated in twice-weekly sessions with part-time Cook County Jail psychiatrist, Dr. Marvin Ziporyn. These continued after Speck's transfer from Cermak Memorial Hospital (inside Chicago's House of Corrections) on July 29, 1966, until February 13, 1967, the day before Speck was transferred to Peoria to stand trial. Ziporyn prepared a discharge summary with depression, anxiety, guilt, and shame among Speck's emotions, but also a deep love for his family. It went on to note an obsessive-compulsive personality and a \\"Madonna-prostitute\\" attitude towards women. Ziporyn maintained Speck viewed women as saintly until he felt betrayed by them for some reason, after which hostility developed. He also diagnosed organic brain syndrome, resulting from the cerebral injuries suffered earlier in Speck's life, and stated he was competent to stand trial but was insane at the time of the crime due to the effects of alcohol and drug use on his organic brain syndrome. Dr. Ziporyn did not testify for the defense or the prosecution, as both sides were troubled to learn before the trial that Ziporyn was writing a book about Speck for financial gain. Ziporyn also earned the ire of the Cook County Jail, which fired him as its part-time psychiatrist the week after Speck's trial ended. At some point during his interviews with Speck, Ziporyn had obtained a written three-sentence consent from Speck authorizing him to tell \\"what I am really like.\\" Ziporyn's biography of Speck was published in the summer of 1967. Confessions Speck later claimed he had no recollection of the murders, but he had confessed the crime to Dr. LeRoy Smith at the Cook County Hospital. Smith did not testify, because the confession was made while Speck was sedated. Illinois Supreme Court Justice John J. Stamos, Cook County's state attorney when Speck was tried, who knew of the hospital confession stated, \\"...we didn't need it. We had an eyewitness.\\" Speck confessed to the murders for the first time in public when he spoke to Chicago Tribune columnist Bob Greene in 1978. In a film inmates made at the Stateville Correctional Center in 1988, Speck recounted the brutal murders in detail. He again stated he was high that night, but then he undercut the idea that the drugs were a mitigating factor, asserting he could just as well have \\"done it sober\\". Trial Speck's jury trial began April 3, 1967, in Peoria, Illinois, three hours southwest of Chicago, with a gag order on the press.\\"The Press and Richard Speck\\". TIME. March 3, 1967. In court, Speck was positively identified by the sole surviving student nurse, Corazon Amurao. When Amurao was asked if she could identify the killer of her fellow students, Amurao rose from her seat in the witness box, walked directly in front of Speck and pointed her finger at him, nearly touching him, and said, \\"This is the man.\\" Lieutenant Emil Giese testified regarding the fingerprints that were matched. On April 15, after 49 minutes of deliberation, the jury found Speck guilty and recommended the death penalty. On June 5, Judge Herbert J. Paschen sentenced Speck to die in the electric chair, but granted an immediate stay pending automatic appeal. The Illinois Supreme Court subsequently upheld his conviction and death sentence on November 22, 1968.Speck Conviction. from CBS Evening News, from the Vanderbilt Television News Archive. November 22, 1968. Speck and XYY syndrome In December 1965 and March 1966, Nature and The Lancet published findings by British cytogeneticist Patricia Jacobs and colleagues of a chromosome survey of patients at Scotland's only security hospital for the developmentally disabled. Nine of the patients, ranging from to height, were found to have an extra Y chromosome, the XYY syndrome. Jacobs' hypothesis, that men with XYY syndrome are more prone to aggressive and violent behavior than males with the normal XY karyotype, was later shown to be incorrect. In August 1966, Eric Engel, a Swiss endocrinologist and geneticist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, wrote to Speck's attorney, Cook County Public Defender Gerald W. Getty, who was reportedly planning an insanity defense. He suggested, based on Jacobs' unsubstantiated theory and Speck's height of , that Speck might have XYY syndrome. A chromosome analysis performed the following month by Engel revealed that Speck had a normal XY karyotype. One month later, a court-appointed panel of six physicians rejected Getty's insanity argument and concluded that Speck was mentally competent to stand trial. In 1968, biochemist Mary Telfer and associates published data from a genetic analysis, similar in design to Jacobs', of subjects confined in psychiatric hospitals and penal institutions in Pennsylvania. Of the five XYY patients identified, four exhibited moderate to severe facial acne, leading the group to suggest that acne be added to the list of defining XYY characteristics. Subsequent research failed to substantiate this observation as well. After Getty contacted Telfer to discuss her findings and their possible relevance to his client, Telfer wrote a speculative piece for the British journal Think in which she mistakenly reported that Speck had an XYY karyotype. That, combined with his extensive acne scarring, led her to describe Speck as \\"the archetypal XYY male\\". In a three-part series on the XYY syndrome published in April 1968, The New York Times presented Jacobs' unsubstantiated theory associating the syndrome with violent behavior as an established fact, and noted that the karyotype had been cited as a mitigating factor by attorneys defending an XYY man charged with murder in Paris, and another in Melbourne. It also identified Speck as a \\"classic example\\" of an \\"XYY criminal\\" and citing Telfer and Getty as sources, predicted that XYY syndrome would form the crux of his insanity defense. Similar articles followed, again citing Telfer, in Time and Newsweek, and six months later in The New York Times Magazine. In May 1968, Speck's chromosomes were karyotyped a second time by Engel, with the same result: a normal 46,XY genome. After Speck's conviction and death sentence were upheld by the Illinois Supreme Court later that year and the appeals process moved to the Federal court system, articles continued to appear in the lay press reporting (or implying) that Speck's supposed XYY genotype would be invoked as a mitigating factor. In a review article published in the Journal of Medical Genetics in December 1968, Michael Court Brown found no overrepresentation of XYY males in chromosome surveys of Scottish prisons and hospitals for the developmentally and mentally disabled, and suggested that any conclusions drawn from study populations composed solely of institutionalized males were likely distorted by selection bias. In May 1969, at the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association, Telfer et al. reported that they had found no evidence of significant behavior differences, on average, between men with XYY karyotypes and those with normal genomes, and that XYY males had been unfairly stigmatized by earlier unsupported speculation. Despite repeated efforts by Getty, Engel, and others to set the record straight regarding Speck's erroneous association with XYY syndrome, he remains labeled as such in some textbooks, online sites, and other sources. Death penalty reversal On June 28, 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court (citing their June 3, 1968 decision in Witherspoon v. Illinois) upheld Speck's conviction but reversed his death sentence, because more than 250 potential jurors were unconstitutionally excluded from his jury because of their conscientious or religious beliefs against capital punishment. The case was remanded back to the Illinois Supreme Court for re-sentencing. On June 29, 1972, in Furman v. Georgia, the U.S. Supreme Court declared the death penalty unconstitutional, so the Illinois Supreme Court's only option was to order Speck re-sentenced to prison by the original Cook County court. On November 21, 1972, in Peoria, Judge Richard Fitzgerald re-sentenced Speck to from 400 to 1,200 years in prison (eight consecutive sentences of 50 to 150 years). He was denied parole in seven minutes at his first parole hearing on September 15, 1976, and at six subsequent hearings in 1977, 1978, 1981, 1984, 1987, and 1990. Life in prison While incarcerated at the Stateville Correctional Center in Crest Hill, Illinois, Speck was given the nickname \\"Birdman\\" after the film Birdman of Alcatraz, because he kept a pair of sparrows that had flown into his cell. He was described as a loner who kept a stamp collection and enjoyed listening to music. His contacts with the warden included requests for new shirts, a radio, and other mundane items. The warden merely described him as \\"a big nothing doing time.\\" Speck was not a model prisoner; he was often caught with drugs or distilled moonshine. Punishment for such infractions never stopped him. \\"How am I going to get in trouble? I'm here for 1,200 years!\\" Speck loathed reporters, and granted only one press interview, in 1978, to Chicago Tribune columnist Bob Greene. During that interview, he publicly confessed to the murders for the first time, and said he thought he would get out of prison \\"between now and the year 2000,\\" at which time he hoped to run his own grocery store business. When Greene asked him if he compared himself to celebrity killers like John Dillinger, he replied, \\"Me, I'm not like Dillinger or anybody else. I'm freakish.\\" Speck stated that at the time of the killings, he \\"had no feelings,\\" but things had changed: \\"I had no feelings at all that night. They said there was blood all over the place. I can't remember. It felt like nothing ... I'm sorry as hell. For those girls, and for their families, and for me. If I had to do it over again, it would be a simple house burglary.\\" Speck's \\"final thought for the American people\\" was, \\"Just tell 'em to keep up their hatred for me. I know it keeps up their morale. And I don't know what I'd do without it.\\" In his book Mindhunter: Inside the FBI's Elite Serial Crime Unit, John E. Douglas of the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit refers to a telling prison incident Speck revealed to him in an interview: \\"he found an injured sparrow that had flown in through one of the broken windows and nursed it back to health. When it was healthy enough to stand, he tied a string around its leg and had it perch on his shoulder. At one point, a guard told him pets weren't allowed. 'I can't have it?' Speck challenged, then walked over to a spinning fan and threw the small bird in. Horrified, the guard said, 'I thought you liked that bird.' 'I did,' Speck replied. 'But if I can't have it, no one can.'\\"  Prison video  In May 1996, Chicago television news anchor Bill Kurtis received video tapes made at Stateville Correctional Center in 1988 from an anonymous attorney. Showing them publicly for the first time before the Illinois state legislature, Kurtis pointed out the explicit scenes of sex, drug use, and money being passed around by prisoners, who seemingly had no fear of being caught; in the center was Speck, performing oral sex on another inmate, sharing a large quantity of cocaine with another inmate, parading in silk panties, sporting female-like breasts (allegedly grown using smuggled hormone treatments), and boasting, \\"If they only knew how much fun I was having, they'd turn me loose.\\" The Illinois legislature packed the auditorium to view the two-hour video, but stopped the screening when the tape showed Speck performing oral sex on another man. From behind the camera, a prisoner asked Speck if he had killed the nurses. Speck responded, \\"Sure I did.\\" When asked why, Speck shrugged and jokingly said, \\"It just wasn't their night.\\" Asked how he felt about himself in the years since, he said, \\"Like I always felt ... had no feeling. If you're asking me if I felt sorry, no.\\" He also described in detail the experience of strangling someone: \\"It's not like TV ... it takes over three minutes and you have to have a lot of strength.\\" Death Speck died of a heart attack on December 5, 1991, the eve of his 50th birthday. Speck's sister feared that his grave would be desecrated, so he does not have a physical resting place. Speck was cremated, and his ashes were scattered in a secret location in the Joliet area.

Considered an annoying prankster in most parts of Brazil, and a potentially dangerous and malicious creature in others, he nevertheless grants wishes to anyone who manages to trap him or steal his magic cap. However, his cap is often depicted as having a bad smell. Most people who claimed to have stolen this cap say they can never wash the smell away. The legend says that a person can trap a Saci inside a bottle when he is in the form of a dust devil. There are several variants of the myth, including:ARA√öJO, Alceu Maynard. Folclore nacional, S√£o Paulo, Ed. Melhoramentos, 1964, v.1, p.419 Saci-perer√™ (), black as coal; Saci-trique (), mulatto and more benign; Saci-sa√ßur√° (), with red eyes. Saci-perer√™ is also the name of a Brazilian cocktail consisting of of cacha√ßa and of honey, which is a home remedy said to be useful in treating the common cold. Powers, weaknesses, and habits Saci An incorrigible prankster, the Saci causes no major harm, but there is no little harm that he won't do. He hides children's toys, sets farm animals loose, teases dogs‚Äîand curses chicken eggs, preventing them from hatching. In the kitchen, the Saci spills salt, sours the milk, burns the bean stew, and drops flies into the soup. If a popcorn kernel fails to pop, it is because the Saci cursed it. Given half a chance, he dulls the seamstress's needles, hides her thimbles, and tangles her sewing threads. If he sees a nail lying on the ground, he turns the point up. In short, people blame anything that goes wrong‚Äîin or outside the house‚Äîon the Saci. Besides disappearing or becoming invisible (often with only his red cap and the red glow of his pipe still showing), the Saci can transform himself into a Matitaper√™ or Matita Pereira, an elusive bird whose melancholic song seems to come from nowhere. One can escape a pursuing Saci by crossing a water stream. the Saci dares not cross, for then he loses all his powers. Another way is to drop ropes full of knots. The Saci is compelled to stop and undo the knots. One can also try to appease him by leaving behind some cacha√ßa, or some tobacco for his pipe. He is fond of juggling embers or other small objects and letting them fall through the holes on his palms. An exceedingly nimble fellow, the lack of his right leg does not prevent him from bareback-riding a horse, and sitting cross-legged while puffing on his pipe (a feat comparable to the Headless Mule's gushing fire from the nostrils). Every dust devil, says the legend, is caused by the spin-dance of an invisible Saci. One can capture him by throwing into the dust devil a rosary made of separately blessed prayer beads, or by pouncing on it with a sieve. With care, the captured Saci can be coaxed to enter a dark glass bottle, where he can be imprisoned by a cork with a cross marked on it. He can also be enslaved by stealing his cap, which is the source of his power. However, depending on the treatment he gets from his master, an enslaved Saci who regains his freedom may become either a trustworthy guardian and friend, or a devious and terrible enemy. Origins of the legend Portrait of the Saci-perer√™ (2007) by J. Marconi. While some claim that the Saci myth originated in Europe in the 13th century such as the monopod, it probably derives from the ≈∂aci-≈∑ater√™ of Tupi-Guarani mythology, a magic one-legged child with bright red hair who would spell-bind people and break the forest's silence with his loud shouts and whistles. He was originally a creature of the night, and indeed the ≈∑aci () means \\"Moon\\" in Old Tupi. This indigenous character was appropriated and transformed in the 18th century by the African slaves who had been brought in large numbers to Brazil. Farm slaves would tell Saci stories to amuse and frighten the children. In this process the creature became black, his red hair metamorphosed into a red cap, and, as the African elders who usually told the tales, he came to be always smoking his clay-and-reed pipe. His name mutated into various forms, such as Saci Taper√™ and S√° Pereira (a common Portuguese name), and eventually Saci Perer√™. His red cap may have been inspired on the Trasgo a mythical Portuguese creature with exact same powers as the Saci. The Saci-Perer√™ concept shows some syncretism with Christian elements: he bolts away when faced with crosses, leaving behind a sulphurous smell -- classical attributes of the devil in Christian folklore. The concepts of imprisoning a supernatural being in a bottle by a magically marked cork, and of forcing him to grant wishes in return of his liberty, have obvious parallels in the story of Aladdin from the Arabian Nights. This may be more than just a coincidence, since some slaves were Muslims and thus presumably familiar with the Arabian tales. Moreover, the occupation of parts of the Portuguese territory (namely in the south) by the Muslim Moors, between the years 711 and 1249, provides another possible path for Arabian influence on the Saci legend. In popular culture * The character remains quite popular in present-day Brazilian urban culture, mainly due to the immensely popular children's book O Saci by Monteiro Lobato (1932). Saci also has appearances in other films and TV series adaptations of S√≠tio do Picapau Amarelo. * In the 1960s, the one-legged gnome -- by now \\"domesticated\\" into a prankish but inoffensive and lovable creature -- was chosen by premier Brazilian cartoonist Ziraldo as the leading character of his comics magazine, Turma do Perer√™. This original publication, the first of its genre to feature entirely \\"national\\" characters, was short-lived, but paved the way for other Brazilian cartoonists like Ziraldo, Angeli, Laerte, and Mauricio de Sousa. * The character also appears in manga Akuma-kun (1963-1964) of Shigeru Mizuki. * Tom Jobim's song √Åguas de Mar√ßo mentions the Matinta Pereira, and Nei Lopes's samba song entitled Fumo de Rolo tells a tale of a fisherman being accosted by the saci while collecting reeds in the forest. The sac√≠ demands some tobacco for his pipe, but the poor fellow has lost his. * Sport Club Internacional has the figure of Saci as its mascot, owing to the club's popular roots and the fans' hope that the team could pull tricks on their opponents. When Wason Renter√≠a played for the club, in the 2005 and 2006 seasons, he would often celebrate his goals by doing an impression of Saci. * With the purpose of countering the growing trend of adopting the Anglo-Celtic Halloween in Brazil (in Portuguese called Dia das Bruxas), the Day of the Saci was created in 2005, and it is likewise commemorated on October 31. A tongue-in-cheek Society of Saci Observers was also created. * In the 2012 video game Max Payne 3, set mainly in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, a trickster Saci makes a cameo as a villain in the in-game cartoon show, The Adventures of Captain Baseball Bat Boy. In it Saci has his trademark pipe, red cap and shorts, and is missing his right leg. However, his skin is green. * The Saci appears in AdventureQuest Worlds. This version has a human- like appearance, wields a spoon, and has a tornado where his legs should be while also performing wind attacks. In science A novel species of dinosauromorph, discovered in 2001 at Agudo (southern Brazil), was named Sacisaurus because the fossil skeleton was missing one leg.Ferigolo, J. and Langer, M.C. (2006), A Late Triassic dinosauriform from south Brazil and the origin of the ornithischian predentary bone, Historical Biology: A Journal of Paleobiology, p. 1-11. The names of the Brazilian satellites SACI-1 and SACI-2 were backronyms on the character's name, as well as four retrotransposons in the DNA of the fluke Schistosoma mansoni were named Saci-1, Saci-2, Saci-3, and Perere, for their ability to jump around in the parasite's genome Since the Saci's one-legged physique reminds us of people with a physical disability, a social network named SACI (an acronym of Solidariedade, Apoio, Comunica√ß√£o e Informa√ß√£o, or Solidarity, Support, Communication and Information) was created at the University of S√£o Paulo with the purpose of stimulating these four efforts towards the social and medical rehabilitation of physically disabled people.Rede SACI: Solidariedade, Apoio, Comunica√ß√£o e Informa√ß√£o - √çndice ¬ª A SACI As a mascot Despite being a one-legged creature, the character is believed to be very agile and powerful, always defeating his enemies. As so, it's a mascot of some sport clubs in Brazil such as Sport Club Internacional and Social Futebol Clube.

The company had a land grant from Britain and a treaty with Indians, but France also claimed the area, and the conflict helped provoke the outbreak of the French and Indian War. Formation Virginian explorers recognized the potential of the Ohio region for colonization and moved to capitalize on it, as well as to block French expansion into the territory. In 1748, Thomas Lee and brothers Lawrence and Augustine Washington organized the Ohio Company to represent the prospecting and trading interests of Virginian investors. Thomas Lee, president of the Virginia Council of State, organized the Ohio Company of Virginia in 1748. In addition to the mandate and investment of Virginia Royal Governor Robert Dinwiddie, other original members included John Hanbury, Colonel Thomas Cresap, George Mercer, John Mercer, and \\"all of His Majesty's Colony of Virginia.\\" In that same year, George Mercer petitioned King George for land in the Ohio country, and in 1749, the British Crown granted the company 500,000 acres in the Ohio Valley between the Kanawha River and the Monongahela. The grant was in two parts: the first 200,000 acres were promised, and the following 300,000 acres were to be granted if the Ohio Company successfully settled one hundred families within seven years. Furthermore, the Ohio Company was required to construct a fort and provide a garrison to protect the settlement at their own expense. But the land grant was rent and tax free for ten years to facilitate settlement. The organizers signed a treaty of friendship and permission at Logstown with the main tribes in the region in 1752 . A rival group of land speculators from Virginia, the Loyal Company of Virginia, was organized about the same time, and included influential Virginians such as Thomas Walker and Peter Jefferson (father of Thomas Jefferson). In 1752 George Mason, later to become a major founding father, became treasurer of the Ohio Company, a post he held for forty years until his death in 1792. French and Indian War 1755 Fry-Jefferson map showing earlier established colonial borders before the French and Indian War In 1748‚Äì1750, the Ohio Company hired Thomas Cresap who had opened a series of trading posts along the Potomac at Long Meadow, Oldtown, Maryland and Will's Creek (now Cumberland) on the foot of the eastern climb up the Cumberland Narrows along what was soon to be called the Nemacolin Trail, one of only three mid-mountain-range crossings of the Appalachian Ridge and Valley system outside the Hudson-Great Lakes route, or southern Georgia-Mississippi-Western Tennessee plains route. Cresap was given a contract to blaze a small road over the mountains to the Monongahela River, and then to start widening this road into a wagon road. In 1750, the Ohio Company hired Christopher Gist, a skillful woodsman and surveyor, to explore the Ohio Valley in order to identify lands for potential settlement. He surveyed by estimating the Kanawhan Region and the Ohio Valley tributaries beginning in 1750, 1751 and 1753. His journals provide valuable insights of the greater Ohio Valley and the Alleghenies. Gist travelled as far west as the Miami Indian village of Pickawillany (near present Piqua, Ohio). Upon the basis of his report, the Ohio Company settled in an area in Western Pennsylvania and present-day West Virginia; Gist and Cresap both receiving sizable settlements on the west side of the mountains. In 1752 the company had a pathway blazed between the small fortified posts at Wills Creek (Cumberland, Maryland), and Redstone Old Fort (Brownsville, Pennsylvania); Cresap and Nemacolin had established the location in 1750, which overlooked Redstone Creek and the ancient Monongahela River ford. The settlement efforts were complicated by the conflicting land claims of the time. The Ohio Country ceded by the King through Governor Dinwiddie included, in Dinwiddie's opinion, the \\"forks of the Monongahela,\\" present-day Pittsburgh. In addition to the Pennsylvania colonial government claims of this territory, the French were fighting for and occupying much of the Ohio Valley, most notably at Fort Duquesne. Dinwiddie responded by sending a military unit under the command of George Washington to the region,wvculture.org: \\"Instructions for George Washington\\", n.d. extracted from The Writings of George Washington, Volume II, by Jared Sparks (Boston: Charles Tappan, 1846), pages 184-186. which led to the outbreak of the French and Indian War. Post- war efforts In 1763, the Ohio Company sent a representative to petition the British Crown for a grant renewal. The plans for settlement and military development continued, with Henry Bouquet's 1764 plans to construct military posts around prospective western settlements. However, following Pontiac's War, land claims west of the Appalachian Mountains were forfeited to the Native American tribes in the Proclamation of 1763, requiring them to be re- purchased through King George III. Grand Ohio Company Vandalia. In 1768, the British government authorized Sir William Johnson to make the Treaty of Fort Stanwix, purchasing land rights from the Iroquois, in accordance with the Proclamation of 1763. Samuel Wharton and William Trent applied for a \\"despoiled traders\\" (frontiersmen who had been aggrieved by the various Indian raids during and after the French and Indian Wars) land grant in 1768, and to get approved by the British Crown, they joined with a number of other land speculators to form the Walpole Company, named for Thomas Walpole, a British lawyer involved in the endeavor. The goal was acquiring 2.5 million acres of Ohio Country land. Benjamin Franklin was one of the seventy-two shareholders, as well as included Franklin's son William (then Royal Governor of New Jersey), George Croghan and Sir William Johnson, as well as Franklin's perennial London allies William Strahan and Richard Jackson. The Walpole Company, Indiana Company, and members of the Ohio Company reorganized, and on December 22, 1769, formed the Grand Ohio Company. In 1772, the Grand Ohio Company received from the British government a grant of a large tract lying along the southern bank of the Ohio as far west as the mouth of the Scioto River. A colony to be called \\"Vandalia\\" was planned. However, the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War interrupted colonization and nothing was accomplished. The company, based in London, ceased operations in 1776. The Ohio Company of Associates was organized in 1786, composed largely of New England veterans who had certificates for land from Congress for their services during the Revolution.The Records of the Original Proceedings of the Ohio Company (1796, reprinted 2008) Notes References *Abernethy, Thomas Perkins.

The land area of about is made up of three low-lying islands surrounding a shallow tidal lagoon connected to the sea by three narrow channels. The shapes and configuration of the islands change over the years due to movement of sand by tidal currents. History First sighted by Europeans in 1802, the islands were originally named Swan Isles because of the large number of swans on the surrounding waters. It was not until 1836 that Lieutenants T M Symonds and H R Henry of surveyed the islands and renamed them Mud Islands. Protection In 1961, the area of the islands above high water was proclaimed a permanent reserve for the management of wildlife. It forms part of the Port Phillip Bay (Western Shoreline) and Bellarine Peninsula Ramsar Site, which was designated in 1982, as a wetland of international importance, and it is also included on the Register of the National Estate. Since 2002 it has been, with the adjacent waters, part of the Port Phillip Heads Marine National Park. Environment Flora Within the reserve there are nine native vegetation communities. Seagrass meadows, sand dunes, mudflats and salt marshes support a diversity of life ranging from marine invertebrates to fish and birds. Wind and tide are gradually changing the shape of the islands, although they are partly stabilised by a salt marsh of austral sea-blite and beaded and shrubby glasswort. The dense coastal scrub on the northern island has disappeared, apparently as a result of overgrazing by rabbits. Today only a single specimen of coastal teatree (Leptospermum laevigatum) remains. Fauna The site is part of the Swan Bay and Port Phillip Bay Islands Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International. Some 70 species of birds have been recorded on the Islands, which form essential breeding, feeding and roosting areas for seabirds and waders, many of them migratory. =Seabirds= The isolation of the islands provides protection from predators and makes them an ideal sanctuary for breeding seabirds, notably the five and a half thousand white-faced storm- petrels which, during summer, lay their eggs in burrows in the loose sand of Middle Island. During the day they feed at sea on shrimps and small fish, returning at night to feed their chicks. Although there are fewer than at nearby South Channel Fort, nearly a quarter of the white-faced storm-petrels in Victoria breed on Mud Islands. Silver gulls are even more numerous. During the second half of the 20th century the breeding population increased to about 100,000. Given a chance, gulls readily attack the eggs and young of other breeding seabirds. The impact is under study. Other seabirds nesting on Mud Islands include nearly a thousand crested terns, one of the largest colonies in Victoria and the only one in Port Phillip. Also important to the islands are the dozen breeding pairs of Caspian terns and, in 1983 and 1986, several pairs of Australian pelicans. Little penguins and fairy terns have bred there in the past. The common tern also roosts in exceptionally large numbers and as many as 260 have been seen there at once. =Waders= The mud from which the islands get their name is excellent feeding habitat for migratory waders. More than 1% of the known Australian populations of four wader species, Pacific golden plover, grey plover, lesser sand plover and ruddy turnstone, spend the summer around Mud Islands. More than 5% of the Victorian populations of red knot, great knot, eastern curlew and bar-tailed godwit feed in Swan Bay to the west but roost on the islands at high tide. Two resident waders, the pied oystercatcher and the red-capped plover, regularly breed on undisturbed parts of the islands. =Other= Few land birds are permanently resident, although many species visit and may breed. Large numbers of straw-necked ibis and, to a lesser extent, Australian white ibis, nest and roost on the islands and fly daily to the mainland for feeding. Lewin's rail occasionally breeds in the salt marsh but is so shy that nesting is seldom recorded. Up to 100 rare orange-bellied parrots have been seen on the islands during winter when they migrate to the Australian mainland from Tasmania. Since the mid-20th century, however, numbers have declined, possibly because the increasing number of gulls has changed the chemistry of the soil and so the vegetation on which the parrots feed. Nevertheless, the islands are an important habitat for this endangered species. Bronze whaler sharks are known to breed around the islands. Access The islands can only be reached by boat, the most convenient departure points being Queenscliff or Sorrento. Day visitors are permitted, but overnight camping is not. BirdLife Australia conduct regular tours to Mud Islands, usually in February and March. South Bay Eco Adventures also run guided walking tours of the islands. As the islands are surrounded by shallow waters, visitors need to be cautious when attempting a landing. Passengers must be ferried to shore by dinghy or else wade in. Visits need careful planning to avoid the boat being stranded at low tide. References * Parks Victoria. (2006). Port Phillip Heads Marine National Park Management Plan. Parks Victoria: Melbourne.

The final purchase by the Ohio Company is in green. The French Grant is orange.350px 350px The Scioto Company was led by American colonel William Duer, a speculator who worked with a British colleague and several French men to register and organize the company in Paris, France. Ostensibly working with the Ohio Company to purchase land in the Northwest Territory, agents of this institution sold worthless deeds to French people intending to emigrate to the United States. Many were refugees from the excesses of the French Revolution, and the emigr√©s were made up of minor aristocrats, merchants, artisans and craftsmen. The Scioto Company did not own the land it was selling. History The Scioto Land Company was founded by American speculator Colonel William Duer and others in 1787 after the Northwest Territory was organized. It was officially established in 1789 as the Compagnie du Scioto in Paris by American Joel Barlow; William Playfair, a Scot who was the agent of Duer and his associates abroad; plus six Frenchmen. This company had arranged in 1787 with the Ohio Company, for the use of about (another source says about ),Peters 1918 : 178 north of the Ohio River and east of the Scioto River, on which the Ohio Company had secured an option. The dishonesty of those who conducted the sales in France, the shady methods of Barlow, and the failure of Duer and his associates to meet their contract with the Ohio Company, caused the collapse of the Scioto Company early in 1790. Two subsequent attempts to revive it failed. Meanwhile about had been purportedly \\"sold\\" to prospective settlers, companies and individuals in France. On February 19, 1791, 218 of these purchasers left Havre de Grace, in France, and arrived on May 3 in Alexandria, District of Columbia (now Alexandria, Virginia). They were among a group known as the French 500, many of whom were fleeing the disruption of the French Revolution. On their arrival, they were told that the Scioto Company owned no land. When they reached Marietta, Ohio, along the Ohio River, about fifty of them landed. In October 1791, the rest of the company proceeded to Gallipolis, which was laid out about that time. It is now within Gallia County, Ohio. The developer had built rude huts for the group, who were mostly urban residents with few skills to survive on the undeveloped frontier. The agent assured them that this site was within the boundary of their purchase. This land, however, fell within the limits of the tract bought outright by the Ohio Company. It had sold it to the Scioto Company, but reclaimed it after Scioto Company failed to complete its payments. In 1794, William Bradford, the U.S. Attorney General, decided that all rights in the on which the Ohio Company had secured an option for the Scioto Company were legally vested in the Ohio Company. In 1795, the Ohio Company sold to the French settlers for $1.25 an acre ($309/km¬≤) the land they occupied and adjacent improved lots. They effectively had to pay twice for their land. Learning of their plight, in 1795 the United States government granted the French some in the southern part of what is now Scioto County, Ohio, with lengthy frontage on the Ohio River.  Text of Act of March 3, 1795 Library of Congress This is known as the First French Grant. Some of the company moved to that area, but most remained in Gallipolis, committed to the land they had started to develop. Four thousand acres of the French Grant were reserved for John Gabriel Gervais, and 20,000 acres were to be divided among the remaining inhabitants of Gallipolis. Eight inhabitants of Gallipolis somehow missed out on the 1795 distribution. In 1798 Congress made an additional adjacent grant, the Second Grant, of for these eight.  Text of Act of June 25, 1798 Library of Congress With their lives having been started in Gallipolis, most of the French residents never occupied either of the grants; they either sold their allotted land or sent tenant farmers to occupy their plots.Peters 1918 : 176‚Äì183 Notes References Northwest Territory Companies established in 1787 Early American land companies Pre-statehood history of Ohio Gallia County, Ohio Scioto County, Ohio 1787 establishments in France French companies established in 1787 ","title":"Scioto Company"},{"id":"700417","text":"A test target is a common feature on interplanetary landing craft such as the Viking Lander and Mars Exploration Rovers.

Delisle thermometers usually had 2400 or 2700 gradations, appropriate to the winter in St. Petersburg, as he had been invited by Peter the Great to St. Petersburg to found an observatory in 1725. In 1738, Josias Weitbrecht recalibrated the Delisle thermometer with two fixed points, keeping 0 degrees as the boiling point and adding 150 degrees as the freezing point of water. He then sent this calibrated thermometer to various scholars, including Anders Celsius. The Celsius scale, like the Delisle scale, originally ran from zero for boiling water down to 100 for freezing water. This was reversed to its modern order after his death, in part at the instigation of Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus and the manufacturer of Linnaeus thermometers, Daniel Ekstr√∂m. The Delisle thermometer remained in use for almost 100 years in Russia.

The French Grant is orange.350px The French Grant (also known as the French-Grant Estates) was a land tract in the Northwest Territory, present day Scioto County, Ohio, that was paid out by the U.S. Congress on March 31, 1795.  Text of Act of March 3, 1795 Library of Congress This was after a group of French colonists were defrauded by the Scioto Company of purchased land grants which rightly were controlled by the Ohio Company of Associates. Not all of the settlers took the grant, some preferring to stay on the East Coast others preferring stay in Gallipolis, Ohio in Gallia County. (Gallia and Gallipolis were named for Gaul, the ancient Latin name of France.) The First Grant extended from a point on the Ohio River above and opposite the mouth of Little Sandy River (Kentucky) in Kentucky, and extending eight miles (13 km) in a direct line down the river, and from the two extremities of that line, reaching back at right angles sufficiently far to include the quantity of land required, which somewhat exceeded .

This grant was for eight Gallipolis residents who did not receive a portion of the First Grant. History The \\"French Grant,\\" a tract of , is situated in the southeastern part of this county. \\"It was granted by Congress in March, 1795, to a number of French families who lost their lands at Gallipolis by invalid titles. It extended from a point on the Ohio river one and a half miles above, but opposite the mouth of Little Sandy creek in Kentucky, and extending eight miles (13 km) in a direct line down the river, and from the two extremities of that line, reaching back at right angles sufficiently far to include the quantity of land required, which somewhat exceeded four and a half miles.\\" additional were, in 1798, granted, adjoining it towards its lower end. Of this tract directly opposite Little Sandy creek were granted to Mons. J. G. GERVAIS, who laid out a town upon it which he called Burrsburg, which never had but a few inhabitants. Thirty years since there were but eight or ten families residing on the French Grant Among the few Frenchmen that settled on the Grant were A. C. VINCENT, Claudius CADOT, Petre CHABOT, Francois VALODIN, Jean BERTRAND, Guillaume DUDUIT, Petre RUISHOND, Mons. GINAT, Doctor DUFLIGNY. The sufferings and hardships of these Frenchmen, so poorly adapted for pioneer life, were very great. (See Gallia County.) They were a worthy, simple-hearted people, and those who remained on the Grant eventually became thrifty and useful citizens. It was in the spring of 1797 that the families of DUDUIT, BERTRAM, GERVAIS, LACROIX and DUTIEL located on their lots in the Grant. They were followed by others, but, as previously stated, only a comparatively small number removed from Gallipolis to Scioto county. In the very valuable series of biographical sketches of Scioto county pioneers, by Mr. Samuel KEYES, are many interesting items illustrative of the characteristics and life of these Frenchmen. We give the following: Liberal Dealing Profitable.‚ÄîM. DUTIEL, in selling grain, used a half-bushel measure a little larger than the law required. Some of his neighbors called his attention to the fact that he was giving more grain than was necessary, when he replied, \\"Well, I know it; but I would rather give too much than too little.\\" This becoming known, DUTIEL always sold out his surplus grain before his neighbors could sell a bushel. Easily Scared.‚ÄîMons. DUDUIT, unlike most of his fellow-countrymen, took naturally to the woods, and soon became an expert hunter and woodsman. Before his removal to the Grant, he had been employed by Col. SPROAT to scour the woods between Marietta and the Scioto, in company with Major Robt. SAFFORD. It was their duty to notify the settlements of the approach of hostile Indians. On one occasion DUDUIT was out hunting with several of his countrymen, when he fired at and killed a deer; whereupon his companions, supposing they had been fired upon by Indians, fled to the settlement, and reported that the Indians had killed DUDUIT and were coming to raid the village. DUDUIT hung up his deer and hastened back to the village, which he found in an uproar and the settlers panic-stricken; but he soon quieted their fears, and induced some of them to assist him in bringing in the deer he had killed. The Laziest Man in the World.‚ÄîPetre RUISHOND was called the \\"laziest man in the world.\\" How he ever came to have energy enough to cross the ocean and work his way out to Ohio was a mystery to all who knew him. He spent a large portion of his time gazing at the stars and predicting future events, particularly changes in the weather. On one occasion a general meeting of the neighborhood was called for a certain date, to put up a bridge. \\"Big Pete,\\" as he was called, predicted rain on that date. Sure enough, it did rain. No almanac-maker could have found occupation on the French Grant after that. RUISHOND was large, awkward and raw-boned. He never married, although often in love. He would go to see the fair object of his affections, but was too bashful to speak his love. He would sit and look at her all day without courage to say a word. He cleared only enough of his of land to raise a few vegetables, just sufficient to support life. For weeks he would live on beans, which he boiled in large quantities to save building a fire too often. Occasionally he would trap a few turkeys, and then revel for a brief time in a change of diet. Finally his cabin burned down. He was too lazy to rebuild, but made a contract with one of his neighbors to keep him for the balance of his life in exchange for his of land. He died about 1823. A French Pettifogger.‚ÄîMons. GINAT had a medium education, and was quite useful to the French in the Grant, through his tact as a pettifogger. His mind seems to have been well adapted to this business, for he is said to have had a particular liking for disputation. He would always waive previous impressions and take the opposition on any question, simply for the sake of showing his talent and confusing his opponent. The French often had misunderstandings with the Yankees, and, as most of them spoke poor English, it was difficult for them always to obtain justice. M. GINAT had given much attention to law and spoke English fluently; he was therefore well prepared to advocate the causes of the French. He must have been expert in this craft, for men much dreaded him as an opponent. A Peculiar Method of Cleaning Wheat.‚Äî\\"Petre CHABOT had a peculiar method of separating wheat from the chaff not practised much, because few could do it. He had what was called a fan. It was made of light boards, with a hoop around three sides about six inches wide. The front was left open, with handles at the sides. He would put in about a peck of wheat and chaff altogether, and would then take it up by the handles in front of him, and throw it up in such a manner that the wheat would fall back in the fan and at the same time blow the chaff out. By throwing it up in this way a few minutes the chaff would all be blown out and the wheat remain in the fan. I have seen negroes in Old Virginia clean hominy in a tray in that way that had been pounded with a hominy block. On account of Mons. CHABOT's ability to clean wheat, he was employed by all his neighbors for the purpose of threshing and cleaning wheat.\\" A Penurious Doctor.‚ÄîDoctor DUFLIGNY left the reputation of extreme penuriousness. While keeping bachelor's hall, two Frenchmen, VINCENT and MAGUET, called on the doctor just before dinner-time. \\"Well, Doctor,\\" they said, \\"we are very hungry and tired, and will have to trouble you for a little dinner.\\" Doctor, looking up sadly, sighing and rubbing his eyes, said, \\"Friends, I am very sorry it is so, but I have been very poorly for some days; have no appetite and have not cooked anything, nor have I prepared anything to cook.\\" The two, making themselves very free, opened the cupboard and continued, \\"Well, Doctor, as you are sick, we can cook a little for ourselves.\\" Doctor‚Äî\\"I don't like to put you to so much trouble; besides I have nothing fit for you.\\" The two exclaimed, \\"Oh! no trouble! Why here are eggs, meat, flour, etc. Oh! we can get a good dinner of this.\\" One made a fire, the other made up some bread, and broke in plenty of eggs. At this the doctor exclaimed, \\"Oh! gentlemen, you can't eat that.\\" The reply was, \\"Never mind, Doctor; don't worry yourself.\\" They prepared a good dinner, put it on the table, and were about to partake, when the doctor remarked, \\"Well, gentlemen, your victuals smell so well, my appetite seems to come to me. I think a little of your dinner cannot hurt me and may help me.\\" Whereupon he drew up his chair, and eat a very hearty dinner with his importunate guests. A Suicide.‚ÄîM. ANTOINME, a jeweler, who had brought his stock in trade to Gallipolis, finding there was no demand for his goods in the backwoods of Ohio, concluded to take them down the river to New Orleans. It was in the autumn of 1791 that he procured a large pirogue and had it manned by two hired men. Besides a vast amount of watches and jewelry, he took with him a supply of firearms for defensive purposes. The party fared well until within a short distance of the mouth of the Big Sandy, when a party of Indians appeared on the river bank. ANTOINME seized a musket and prepared to fire on the Indians, when his cowardly hirelings became panic-stricken and threatened him with instant death if he dared fire at them and thus provoke their anger. ANTOINME in despair over the prospect of losing all his possessions, placed the musket to his head and blew out his brains. At the report of the gun the Indians turned to flee, but the hired men called them back, saying the man had only shot himself. The Indians boarded the pirogue, threw ANTOINME'S body overboard after rifling it, and took possession of such ammunition, provisions, arms, clothing and jewelry as suited their fancy. Much jewelry, tools, watches, etc., of which they could see no value, were thrown overboard and it is said that for many years afterwards watch crystals, etc., were found near this place. The Indians gave the cowardly hirelings two blankets and a loaf of bread each and sent them to the fort at Cincinnati. A Scholarly Pioneer.‚ÄîAntoine Claude VINCENT settled on the grant as a farmer. He had been educated in France for a Roman Catholic priest, but his liberal opinions prevented his ordination, and he became a silversmith, and came to Gallipolis in the service of M. ANTOINME, whose tragic death we have related. VINCENT settled in Gallipolis, afterward taught school in Marietta. It was while teaching school at the latter place and boarding at a hotel, that Louis PHILIPPE with two relatives, traveling incognito visited the same hotel. There were many French then in Marietta and being favorably disposed to the Royalists', Louis PHILIPPE made himself known to them. The Duke of Orleans (Louis PHILIPPE) and his relatives were on their way to New Orleans, and sought some one to accompany them. Louis himself was very dejected and gloomy and sat with his \\"chapeau\\" far over his eyes, his face downcast and supported by his hands. He rarely spoke, but his relatives had the free use of their tongues. They were much pleased with Mons. VINCENT and greatly desired him to share their fortune and accompany them to the city of New Orleans; and as the two relatives seemed about to fail in their object, the future sovereign of France broke his gloomy silence and with honest tears streaming from his eyes said, \\"Yes, come along with us, VINCENT, come; we are now wretched outcasts, alone, friendless, homeless, moneyless, wandering through this wilderness infested with wild beasts and worse savages, far from our dear native land. We need you now, and yet can repay you nothing, but the time will come when we can and will; law and order will soon be restored; we will wait that occasion and then peaceably return and be restored to our possessions and rights. Then we can and will repay you; we will have offices to fill and titles to confer. They will be yours, only come with us now in our distress.\\" Louis and his companions, however, could not prevail on M. VINCENT to accompany them. A Copperhead.‚ÄîSome time after this VINCENT was living alone in a house in the wilderness. He had occasion to get up one night, when he felt something, which he thought was a wire strike his foot repeatedly. He was soon convinced, however, that it was a snake and he started for the village to seek a physician. Before he could reach the village his feet were so swollen, that he was obliged to crawl the last quarter of a mile. The physician pronounced the bite that of a copperhead, and for three weeks VINCENT lay at the point of death, during which time he suffered excruciating agony, in his paroxysms literally gnawing to pieces the blanket which was his covering. Lost in a Snow Storm.‚ÄîOn another occasion VINCENT was overtaken in the night by a severe snow-storm, lost his way, was overcome by the cold and fell to the ground unconscious. Recovering consciousness in a short time he discovered that the storm had passed over and near by stood a house. He endeavored to rise, but his feet were frozen and he found he could only move by dragging himself along, using his elbows. After much painful effort he reached the house, and his cries soon brought assistance. For six weeks it was a question if he would survive his terrible experience, but, by the external use of lime water, his flesh was healed, although not with the loss of most of the first joints of his hands and feet. Notwithstanding his sore experiences Mons. VINCENT lived a long and useful life, during which he became wealthy, reared a large family and held the high respect of all who knew him. He was a man of liberal education, read VOLTAIRE and ROUSSEAU, and while in his Western home, was a student of history, philosophy, mathematics, ethics and music. He was a find musician, being a great lover of the flute and violin, both of which he played well until he lost part of his fingers by freezing. He died August 22, 1846, in his 74th year.

He played guitar and sang lead vocals on many of the band's early hit singles. He has been praised by the band for his guitar skills and Ray Charles-influenced vocal style. Growing up in a musical family, Kath took up a variety of instruments in his teens, including the drums and banjo. He played bass in a number of bands in the mid-1960s, before settling on the guitar when forming the group that became Chicago. His guitar playing was an important component of the group's sound from the start of their career. He used a number of different guitars, but eventually became identified with a Fender Telecaster fitted with a single neck-position humbucker pickup combined with a bridge position angled single-coil pickup and decorated with numerous stickers. Kath was also said to be Jimi Hendrix's favorite guitarist. Kath struggled with health issues and drug abuse towards the end of the 1970s. He died in January 1978 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. The bereavement tempted Chicago to consider disbanding, but they ultimately decided to resume as is signified by their memorial song \\"Alive Again\\". To commemorate his musicianship, they issued the 1997 album, The Innovative Guitar of Terry Kath. Early life Kath was born to Raymond Elmer \\"Ray\\" (1912‚Äì2003) and Evelyn Meline Haugen Kath (1916‚Äì1982) on January 31, 1946, in Chicago, Illinois. He has an older brother, Rod Kath. He was raised in the Norwood Park neighborhood of Chicago. He attended Taft High School. He was of German, English, and Scandinavian descent. His brother played the drums and his mother played the banjo, and Kath attempted to learn these instruments too. He acquired a guitar and amplifier when he was in the ninth grade, and his early influences included The Ventures, Johnny Smith, Dick Dale, and Howard Roberts. He was later influenced by George Benson, Kenny Burrell, Mike Bloomfield, Eric Clapton, and Jimi Hendrix. Unlike several other Chicago members who received formal music training, Kath was mostly self-taught and enjoyed jamming. In a 1971 interview for Guitar Player, he said he had tried professional lessons but abandoned them, adding \\"All I wanted to do was play those rock and roll chords.\\" His father wanted him to have a steady career, but he decided he would prefer a career in music. Career Early career Kath joined his first semi-professional band, The Mystics, in 1963, moving to Jimmy Rice and the Gentlemen in 1965. He then played bass in a road band called Jimmy Ford and the Executives. Considered to be the bandleader, Kath guided the band's musical direction. Ford was the trumpeter, Walter Parazaider played saxophone and other wind instruments, and Danny Seraphine later became the drummer. Kath became close friends with Seraphine as they formed the rhythm section, as well as with Parazaider. The three musicians regularly socialized outside of the band. They were fired from the group, which wanted to merge with another band, Little Artie and the Pharaohs, while leader and guitarist Mike Sistack explained that \\"it's just business.\\" In 1966, Kath joined a cover band called the Missing Links, taking Parazaider and Seraphine with him, and started playing clubs and ballrooms in Chicago on a regular basis. Parazaider's friend at De Paul University, trumpeter Lee Loughnane, also sat in with the band from time to time. Kath's compatriot, James William Guercio (who later became Chicago's producer) was lead guitarist in one of two road bands performing on The Dick Clark Show with the Missing Links. Kath received an offer from Guercio to play bass for the Illinois Speed Press and move to Los Angeles, but declined as he considered the guitar his main instrument and wanted to sing lead. He stayed with Parazaider, Seraphine, and Loughnane instead, who quickly recruited trombonist James Pankow from De Paul and vocalist/keyboardist Robert Lamm. Kath sang the lower range of lead vocals in the group in a style reminiscent of Ray Charles. The group practiced at Parazaider's parents' basement and changed its name to The Big Thing. With the addition of singer and bassist Peter Cetera of The Exceptions, they moved to Los Angeles and signed with Columbia Records, renaming the band Chicago Transit Authority. In mid-1969, the name was shortened to Chicago. Chicago Kath was regarded as Chicago's bandleader and best soloist; and his vocal, jazz and hard rock influences are regarded as integral to the band's early sound. He has been praised for his guitar skills and described by rock author Corbin Reiff as \\"one of the most criminally underrated guitarists to have ever set finger to fretboard\\". According to Loughnane, Kath could sing a lead vocal and play lead and rhythm guitar simultaneously. The group's first album, Chicago Transit Authority, released in 1969, includes Kath's composition \\"Introduction,\\" described as \\"Terry's masterpiece\\" by later Chicago guitarist Dawayne Bailey. The song displays many varied musical styles, including jazz, blues, salsa, rock and roll, acid rock, and pop. The same debut album includes an instrumental guitar piece titled \\"Free Form Guitar\\", which consisted largely of feedback and heavy use of the Stratocaster's tremolo arm. The album liner notes indicate that the nearly seven-minute piece was recorded live in the studio in one take, using only a Fender Dual Showman amplifier pre-amped with a Bogen Challenger P.A. amp. The guitar's neck was held together with a radiator hose clamp. The song \\"Beginnings\\" includes acoustic rhythm guitar by Kath. For the group's second album, Kath contributed an extended guitar solo on \\"25 or 6 to 4\\", which became a live favorite. The same album saw Kath collaborate with orchestral arranger Peter Matz on the four-part suite \\"Memories of Love\\", singing the lead vocal. Kath wrote at least one song and contributed at least one lead vocal to every Chicago album released during his lifetime. While 1976's Chicago X is best known for Cetera's number one hit, \\"If You Leave Me Now\\", Kath's \\"Once or Twice\\" showed he was still writing and recording rock material. He continued this style on the following year's Chicago XI, contributing the funky \\"Mississippi Delta City Blues\\" and the aggressive \\"Takin' It on Uptown\\", which counterbalanced some of the material other members were producing. Kath reunited with Nick Morrone at the August, 1976 Kalamazoo concert, where they made plans to work on Terry's solo album, something he had been planning for a number of years. The day before Nick was to fly to Los Angeles to work with Kath, Kath died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. After his death, to memorialize Kath and to commemorate the resumption of Chicago, the band composed and published the song \\"Alive Again\\" on its first album without him, Hot Streets. Also in Kath's honor, they later published the song \\"Feel the Spirit\\". Equipment Kath used several guitars in his early career, but many of these early ones were stolen while on the road. His first main instrument that he used when Chicago were still The Big Thing was a Register guitar that cost $80. When the band started becoming successful, he traded up to a Fender Stratocaster. He also used a Gibson SG Standard, as pictured on Chicago Transit Authority's inner sleeve, a Gibson SG Custom and was one of the few well-known guitarists to make regular use of the 1969 Les Paul \\"Professional\\" model, which sported a pair of unconventional low-impedance pickups with a special impedance-matching transformer for use with a standard high impedance-input amplifier. Kath tended to favor light strings, though for the top E string, he used one from a tenor guitar. In an interview with Guitar Player, he said that he used the tenor guitar string for the top E and moved all the regular strings down (top E was used as B, B used as a G, and so forth). For acoustic parts, he played an Ovation acoustic guitar. In the latter part of his career, he favored a Fender Telecaster, which he heavily modified. The standard blonde Telecaster had its black pickguard and its neck-position pickup removed, and the hole enlarged and fitted with a Gibson humbucker. The guitar control plate was also reversed. He was an early investor in the Pignose company (a manufacturer of guitar amplifiers) and served in the management of the company and decorated his Telecaster with 25 Pignose stickers and a Chicago Blackhawks logo. Most of Kath's guitars had gone missing for many years, including the famous \\"Pignose\\" Telecaster. Several were located by Kath's daughter Michelle Kath Sinclair, at the home of her step-grandmother, during her research for the documentary film Chicago: The Terry Kath Experience. Among the re-discovered equipment was his \\"Pignose\\" Telecaster, an Ovation acoustic, a Fender Stratocaster, and a Gibson SG Custom with the pickups removed. Kath experimented with a wide variety of amplification and distortion devices and used a wah-wah pedal frequently. Fascinated by gadgets, Kath was interested in trying to play guitar without using a pick. Lamm recalled him attempting to make an auto-picking device using a modified electrical cocktail mixer. Vocals Kath sang lead vocals on several of Chicago's early songs, including \\"I'm a Man\\" from the Chicago Transit Authority, the singles \\"Beginnings\\", \\"Colour My World\\" and \\"Make Me Smile\\" from \\"Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon\\", featured on Chicago II, \\"Dialogue (Part I & II)\\" from Chicago V, \\"Wishing You Were Here\\" from Chicago VII, \\"Brand New Love Affair\\" from Chicago VIII. His vocal delivery was later described by Lamm as \\"The White Ray Charles\\". Pankow, who wrote \\"Make Me Smile\\", tried rehearsing the song with various members singing lead, but ultimately settled on Kath, saying \\"bingo ‚Äì 'that' was the voice.\\" As one of the three primary lead singers of Chicago, along with Peter Cetera and Robert Lamm, Kath's vocal range fell in the middle of the other two, between Cetera's higher tenor and Lamm's fuller, lower baritone. He often collaborated with Cetera on lead vocals, as they did in \\"Dialogue (Part I & II)\\" and \\"Brand New Love Affair\\". Kath also played lead guitar and sang lead vocals on the closing song \\"Tell Me\\" in the 1973 drama movie Electra Glide in Blue. The song was used in the final episode of the television series Miami Vice. Personal life and death Kath had a self-admitted history of drug abuse, including alcohol. Seraphine knew that Kath had a high tolerance for drugs, but later recalled Kath telling him, \\"I'm going to get things under control ... if I don't, this stuff is going to kill me.\\" Chicago bandmates have indicated that he was also increasingly unhappy. However, Guercio has said that Kath was finishing writing a solo album before he died, and Pankow adamantly denies that Kath was suicidal. By 1978, Kath was regularly carrying guns around and enjoyed shooting them. Around 5 p.m. Pacific Standard Time on Monday, January 23, after a party at the home of roadie and band technician Don Johnson, in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California, Kath began to play with his guns. He spun his .38 revolver on his finger, put it to his temple, and pulled the trigger. The gun was not loaded. Johnson warned Kath several times to be careful. Kath then picked up a semi-automatic 9-mm pistol and, leaning back in a chair, said to Johnson, \\"Don't worry about it ... Look, the clip is not even in it.\\" His last words were, \\"What do you think I‚Äôm gonna do? Blow my brains out?\\" To assuage Johnson's concerns, Kath showed Johnson the empty magazine. Kath then replaced the magazine in the gun, put the gun to his temple and pulled the trigger. Apparently unbeknownst to Kath, the semi-automatic had a round in the chamber. He died instantly from the gunshot, eight days shy of his 32nd birthday. Kath left behind a girlfriend, Camelia Emily Ortiz, whom he had met in June of 1972, as revealed in Chicago, The Terry Kath Experience, and a 20-month old daughter, Michelle Kath (now Michelle Kath Sinclair). He was married to Pamela Robinson in May of 1970 and the marriage ended in divorce, which was finalized in May of 1975, per California Public Records. After his death, Camelia married and later divorced actor Kiefer Sutherland. Kath is interred near his mother, Evelyn Kath, and father, Raymond Kath, in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California, in the Gardens of Remembrance.The Day the Music DiedOfficial bio The group's members were devastated over losing Kath and strongly considered disbanding, but were persuaded by Doc Severinsen, musical director of the Tonight Show band, to continue. Kath's position as guitarist in Chicago was subsequently filled by Donnie Dacus, then Chris Pinnick, Dawayne Bailey, and Keith Howland. At Chicago concerts, original members Lee Loughnane (trumpet) and Robert Lamm (keyboards) have, on occasion, performed lead vocals originally sung by Terry Kath. Legacy Because Chicago considered themselves a team, some band members have subsequently claimed Kath's contributions to be generally overlooked. Parazaider later said, \\"If [Kath] was totally up front, he would have had a lot more recognition.\\" Jimi Hendrix was a fan of Kath, and declared him to be a better guitarist. Rock guitarist Dweezil Zappa rates Kath as number one on his list of top ten guitarists. In September 1997, Chicago released Chicago Presents The Innovative Guitar of Terry Kath, a CD remembrance of their late guitarist, on their own short-lived Chicago Records label. Band members have since wondered if Kath would have stayed with Chicago had he lived, or started a solo career. In 2010, Parazaider said: > \\"I'm not sure about that. [Terry] was a free spirit ... He was his own > person when it came to different things. I would like to think he (would > still be with Chicago), but he was very independent and I wonder what he > would have thought about the 1980s. I'd have to say it's 50/50. It could > have gone either way.\\" In 2012, Kath's daughter Michelle Kath Sinclair announced that enough funds had been donated to complete production on a documentary of his life, titled Searching for Terry: Discovering a Guitar Legend. In 2014, she confirmed she had interviewed the entire band except for Cetera, and the project was planned for release in 2016. The film made its world premiere at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival, renamed as The Terry Kath Experience, and Peter Cetera was listed among the cast members. It made its United States premiere at the DOC NYC film festival in November 2016 under the same name, and was soon after acquired by FilmRise, which planned a 2017 release. The film made its television premiere on AXS TV, under the name, Chicago: The Terry Kath Experience, on November 7, 2017, and it was released as VOD and DVD on December 12. The film includes interviews with guitarists Jeff Lynne, Steve Lukather, Mike Campbell, Dean DeLeo and Joe Walsh, who all praised Kath's work. Walsh said, \\"He was a great guy; he was a brilliant musician. He was a songwriter and a great singer. He was such a monster on guitar. ... He was just a total experimenter\\". On April 8, 2016, Chicago was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. During the ceremony in Brooklyn, New York. Michelle Kath Sinclair accepted the award on her father's behalf.

Developed by Black Ops Entertainment and co-published by Electronic Arts and MGM Interactive, it was released for the Sony PlayStation in November 1999. It is the first 007-game that was published by Electronic Arts since acquiring the James Bond licence. This game marks the second appearance of Pierce Brosnan's James Bond, although the voice of Bond is provided by actor Adam Blackwood in the game. Gameplay Screenshot of a wounded Bond outside a Russian military outpost Tomorrow Never Dies broke away from the gameplay that made GoldenEye 007 a success, by choosing to make a third-person shooter and by leaving out a multiplayer portion of the game. It is the first of three games in the James Bond franchise that allows players to control a character other than James Bond himself, namely Wai-Lin in one level. Plot Bond begins to cross the China‚ÄìRussia border into a Russian radar base, which is intercepting messages delicate in subject. Using a laser designator, Bond targets the dish and a British jet flies over, dropping an Air to Surface missile. A helicopter arrives, and Bond kills the occupants, and recovers a key. He uses the key to unlock a large gate, and makes his escape on skis. Bond reaches the end of the run - a sheer cliff drop. Bond continues on, and opens his Union Jack parachute. Bond later lands in an Arms Bazaar. After taking photographs of military hardware, a British naval ship launches a BGM-109 Tomahawk to eliminate all potential threats and hardware. Bond realizes there are nuclear weapons at the Bazaar on a MIG jet (in reality, the jet was a L-39 Albatros). After an intense firefight between Bond and Russian terrorists, he hijacks the jet and returns to MI6. Bond is sent to investigate a man called Elliot Carver during a party in Hamburg, Germany after a British warship sank in the South China Sea, with all hands going down. Carver media published the full story before MI6 received a full report, raising MI6's suspicions. During the party Bond meets his former lover, Paris, now Carver's wife, who slaps him. Carver arrives, and offers a \\"tour of the facilities\\". Bond follows, but is knocked out by a henchman. He wakes up in a room with a large 2-way mirror. He uses his laser-cufflinks to escape, then he destroys the central computer, allowing him to make his escape. He then makes his way to the press, and engages in a firefight between Carver's guards. He recovers Henry Gupta's GPS scrambler, which was used to lure the British Navy into Chinese waters to try and spark an international incident. As the existing Chinese government is not receptive to giving Carver Media Group Network exclusive broadcast rights in China, Carver plans to start a war to eliminate the present government and replace it with politicians more supportive to his plans. Bond then escapes to the \\"Hotel Atlantic\\", where Paris is being held prisoner. He arrives, and heads to the bar where he asks to see Paris; resulting in a shootout between Bond and the guards, who were working for Carver. Bond uses the elevator to get to Paris' apartment, where he meets Kaufman. Kaufman tries to kill Bond by using spinning razor discs and an AK-47. Bond kills Kaufman and helps Paris escape. They make it to the underground garage, where Bond drives away in his BMW 7 Series. MI6 has found the headquarters of Henry Gupta near the foothills of the Swiss Alps. The convoy of terrorist cars and trucks is heading to Henry's alpine hideout for an important meeting. Bond is sent to stop the convoy. Along the way Bond meets Q, who gives him the BMW to stop the Convoy. Bond successfully destroys the convoy with the BMW and drives away. Bond is then sent to a ski ridge in Hokkaido, Japan, to track down and kill chemical expert Satoshi Isagura, who is thought to be working for Elliot Carver after a nerve gas attack at Yokohama. The Carver Media was also the first to report the story. Bond kills Isagura and is sent to Saigon. Bond steals a data disk from Carver Media Tower in Saigon but is captured. Bond manages to escape with the data disk. The next night, Carver bribes the Saigon Military Police to kill Bond on sight, so MI6 pulls Bond out as the mission would be compromised were Bond to be seen or killed. Bond gives Wai Lin the data disk, and Wai Lin engages the Saigon Military Police in a gun battle with the Police setting roadblocks and using fast firing chain guns. She makes it back to her lab to find the location of Carter's stealth boat, hidden in H·∫° Long Bay. On the stealth boat, Bond uses the boat's comm-link to give MI6 its position. Wai Lin is kidnapped but is later freed by Bond after he kills Carver's right-hand man, Stamper. Wai Lin stops the engine while Bond shoots and kills Carver and stops the stolen nuclear missile from destroying Beijing. Bond and Wai Lin escapes the stealth boat before it self-destructs. Development The game was originally intended as a continuation of the film with a story that would have picked up where the film left off. David Bishop, president of MGM Home Entertainment, said in June 1998, \\"We didn't see any benefit to following the script verbatim. We just felt we had more freedom in what we could bring the gaming world if we went outside the set script.\\" However, focus groups were more interested in seeing familiar scenes from the film. Additional levels and a two-player mode were removed from the game during development. Reception Tomorrow Never Dies was met with very mixed reviews. It received an average score of 62.44% at GameRankings, based on an aggregate of 28 reviews. It was criticized for its changes from a first-person to third-person shooter, the average gameplay, awkward controls, short length and lack of a multiplayer component. As a result, it did not capture the same success as its predecessor GoldenEye. However, the voice acting and soundtrack were praised, and for the most part, the game stayed true to the film's source material. Adam Pavlacka reviewed the game for Next Generation, and stated that \\"Take away the Bond license, and what's left is a very basic third-person shooter with little innovation.\\" Tomorrow Never Dies received a \\"Platinum\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

The record is a concept album, detailing the experience of a man dreaming about the rift in his relationship with his girlfriend. It is the second time that the band had recorded an album with such a central concept, the first being the rock opera-styled The Man Who Stepped into Yesterday from 1987, which has never been officially released. Rift was recorded in September and October 1992 and produced by Muscle Shoals music veteran Barry Beckett. Rift was certified gold by the RIAA on October 15, 1997.

The album was the band's first official live release, their first album to be certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America and one of the best-selling releases in their catalog. Background and contents Although tapes of concerts recorded from the audience had been distributed among Phish's fanbase for several years by the time of A Live One's release, the album marked the first time that the band had officially released live recordings directly from their soundboard masters. The album was named after a question that the band members were often asked by fans: \\"When are you gonna put out a live one?\\". Each track on the album was recorded at a different live show in the United States mainly during Phish's 1994 fall tour with one track taken from that year's summer tour. Although recorded at different venues, the songs are noted in the liner notes as having been recorded at \\"The Clifford Ball\\", a reference to aviator Clifford Ball that the band would use again as the name of their 1996 festival. This decision was made because the band's management could not secure the recording rights from every venue featured on the album at the time of its release. Five of the songs - \\"Gumbo\\", \\"Slave to the Traffic Light\\", \\"Wilson\\", \\"Simple\\" and \\"Harry Hood\\" - had never appeared on any of Phish's studio albums, but all of them were and are regularly performed by the band in concert. A Live One marked the first time all five had appeared on an official Phish release; Of those songs, only \\"Slave to the Traffic Light\\" would subsequently be released in a studio version, when a recording of the song from 1986 appeared on the 1998 Elektra reissue of the band's demo release The White Tape. The track \\"Montana\\" is a two-minute excerpt from the longform improvisation that followed ‚ÄúTweezer‚Äù during the band's show in Bozeman, Montana.Phish.net Song History: Montana Online. Accessed: August 23, 2011. On A Live One, \\"Montana\\" serves as a prelude to the epic \\"You Enjoy Myself\\", one of the most well-known versions of that song. Tracklist selection The track-listing for A Live One was selected by the four members of Phish, each of whom reviewed the concert tapes from their 1994 fall tour and drafted a list of personal favorite performances. The band then compiled a master list of 560 song performances that had received mention by at least two of the members, which was further narrowed down to a shortlist of 30 songs, from which the final tracklist was selected. In addition to utilizing their own selections, Phish involved their fanbase in the compilation of the album. The band posted an official thread on the rec.music.phish Usenet newsgroup, in which the message board's users were encouraged to suggest performances they believed should be included. The July 8, 1994 version of \\"Stash\\" was brought to the band's attention through the thread, and was ultimately chosen for inclusion on the album. Sales In July 1995, A Live One peaked at #18 on the Billboard 200 album chart in the United States, and was their first album to reach the chart's Top 20. \\"Bouncing Around the Room\\" and \\"Gumbo\\" were both issued as singles, but neither appeared on a Billboard chart. Phish received its first RIAA award for the album. The RIAA certified the album gold on November 10, 1995 for sales of 500,000 copies, and platinum on October 9, 1997 for sales of over 1 million copies.

It is distinguishable from other indigobird species by bill and leg colours, the colour tinge of the male's breeding plumage, song, and to lesser extent, the nestling's plumage and mouth pattern. The bill colour can be red or white depending on the population, and there is some regional variation in the colour tone of the male's plumage. Distribution and habitat It is a resident breeding bird in most of Africa south of the Sahara Desert. This indigobird is found in many open habitats including open woodland, scrub and cultivation, but, as its name implies, it is most readily seen near villages. Cycle of life It is a brood parasite which lays its eggs in the nests of red-billed firefinches. Unlike the common cuckoo, it does not destroy the host's egg. Typically, 2-4 eggs are added to those already present. The eggs of both the host and the firefinch are white, although the indigobird's are slightly larger. The nestling indigobirds mimic the unique gape pattern of the fledglings of the host species. Behavior The male village indigobird is territorial, and he has an elaborate courtship flight display. The song is given from a high perch, and consists of rapid sputtering and churring intermingled with mimicry of red-billed firefinch's song, especially the characteristic chick-pea-pea-pea. The diet of this species consists of seeds and grain. Description The village indigobird is 11‚Äì12 cm in length. The adult male is entirely greenish-black or bluish-black except for his orange-red legs and conical white bill. The female resembles a female house sparrow, with streaked brown upperparts, buff underparts, a whitish supercilium and a yellowish bill, although she also has red legs. Immature birds are like the female but plainer and without a supercilium. Many of the indigobirds are very similar in appearance, with the males difficult to separate in the field, and the young and females near impossible. Helpful pointers with the village indigobird are the association with its host species, the red-billed firefinch, and its presence near human habitation.

The progressive rock song \\"Guyute\\" is the only track on the album to pre-date 1997, having first been performed by Phish in 1994. A few of the album's songs reflect the band's 1997 \\"cow-funk\\" sound, with bass guitarist Mike Gordon taking a more prominent role. Anastasio had coined the \\"cow-funk\\" term in the band's 1997 official biography The Phish Book, observing that \\"What we‚Äôre doing now is really more about groove than funk. Good funk, real funk, is not played by four white guys from Vermont.\\" Much of the album, however, is defined by what Rolling Stone called an \\"unhurried vibe ... with airy, uncluttered grooves and relaxed vocals.\\"Kot, Greg.

Early incarnations of several tracks from the album can be heard on the 2000 release Trampled by Lambs and Pecked by the Dove, a collection of song sketches recorded by frontman Trey Anastasio and lyricist Tom Marshall. The album was recorded of the course of several sessions at Bearsville Studios in the village of Bearsville, New York, where the band had also recorded Billy Breathes. The band chose Andy Wallace to produce the album because of his work on Reign in Blood by Slayer, Nevermind by Nirvana and Grace by Jeff Buckley. \\"Birds of a Feather\\", \\"Frankie Says\\", and \\"Shafty\\" (the latter song a reworking of Phish original \\"Olivia's Pool\\") were all debuted live during the \\"Island Tour\\", a brief run of shows the band played while taking a break from recording the album in April 1998. All four nights of the \\"Island Tour\\" were later released as part of the LivePhish Series. In 2000, during the promotion for Farmhouse, many interviews saw Anastasio citing a certain disdain for the process of creating The Story of the Ghost. He was critical of the band's \\"socialistic\\" approach to the song selection for the album. \\"There were songs I thought should have gone on The Story of the Ghost album, that were better than the songs that got on there\\", Anastasio said in a 2000 interview. \\"If anyone didn't like a song it was out. But what happens with that approach is the material gets watered down. You end up with songs that everyone is fine with, but the best songs are usually those where one person is passionately for and one person really hates, because the best songs are those that arouse strong reactions\\".Geoffrey Himos. Farm Boy: Trey Anastasio Sows the Fields of Phish Tom Marshall recalls that one of these stronger songs was omitted in favor of what he felt was a weaker track in \\"Fikus\\".Randy Ray. The High Watermark with Tom Marshall and Trey Anastasio Part I Anastasio named \\"Bug\\" and \\"Twist\\" as two songs he was disappointed were cut from the album, and both later appeared on Farmhouse.

For the next 140 years the NHM developed a large international branch network and increasingly engaged in banking operations, and subsequently would become one of the primary ancestors of ABN AMRO. History The building at Vijzelstraat 32 in Amsterdam known today as \\"De Bazel\\", is named after its architect Karel de Bazel. Today it houses the Amsterdam Archives, but it was originally built in 1919-1926 for the NHM and it is decorated with many details reminiscent of Indonesia, most notably the brickwork, which earned the building the nickname \\"spekkoek\\". The NHM was a private company which issued publicly traded shares and according to the king, the NHM would act to leverage economic activity and encourage the development of national wealth. However, in practice it came down to expanding existing trade, by gathering data and searching for new markets as well as financing industry and shipping. Its close association with Dutch government meant it played an important role in the development of trade between the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies.(Dutch) explanation of building in Amsterdam Archives Its former headquarters in De Bazel in Amsterdam houses the Amsterdam Archives today.Amsterdam Archives The NHM is sometimes called the successor of the Dutch East India Company, as it was also a private company that issued shares and financed trade with the Dutch East Indies. The establishment of the NHM could probably be seen as an attempt to bring new impetus to trade with the Dutch East Indies after the depression of the years of French domination (1795‚Äì1814) and the final collapse of the Dutch East India Company two decades earlier. The NHM financing of trade and shipping led to the development of a network of branches which increasingly engaged in financing and banking operations. The network extended throughout South East Asia and on the trade routes between the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies and the NHM continued to extend its network into the 20th century. It lost a number of its branches when the Indonesian government nationalised them in 1960 to form a new locally owned bank, but by then had branches in many other parts of the world. The NHM continued to develop more and more banking and financing operations with its branch network and it went on to become one of the primary ancestors of ABN AMRO bank when in 1964 it merged with the Dutch Twentsche Bank to form Algemene Bank Nederland (ABN).

The album was released on May 16, 2000, by Elektra Records. Farmhouse was the last Phish studio album before their two-year hiatus between October 2000 and December 2002. The album's first single, \\"Heavy Things\\", was one of Phish's most successful radio hits; It was the band's only song to appear on a mainstream pop radio format, reaching #29 on Billboard's Adult Top 40 chart that July. The song also became the band's biggest hit to date on the Adult Alternative Songs chart, reaching #2 there. The song had previously been performed for live broadcast during the overnight set of Phish's New Year's Eve 2000 show at Big Cypress (reportedly then the largest concert in the world) as part of ABC's coverage of New Year's festivities around the globe.Phish.net Song History: Heavy Things Phish.net.

Owing in part to the mainstream exposure of \\"Heavy Things\\", Farmhouse had the highest- ever first week sales for a Phish record.Phish.net: Farmhouse Phish.net. Online. Accessed: September 1, 2011. The album was certified gold by RIAA on January 30, 2006. Production Songwriting for Farmhouse was a joint effort between Trey Anastasio and Phish lyricist Tom Marshall, with contributions from Tony Markellis, Russ Lawton and Scott Herman. All of the songs were already part of Phish's live concert song rotation before being recorded for the album, some dating back to 1997. The tracks were recorded at The Barn, frontman Trey Anastasio's studio in Chittenden County, Vermont. The introduction to \\"Piper\\" is an extract from the band's live performance of the song on July 18, 1999 at their Camp Oswego Festival in Volney, New York. There is also a Japanese version of the album available as an import which include two bonus studio out-take tracks from the Farmhouse recording sessions which are \\"Driver\\" and \\"Mist.\\" These two songs are currently not available in any format online by Phish although as of December 2018 it can be purchased in its original CD format on Amazon.com and possibly elsewhere for about twice the price of the standard version of the album. Early incarnations of several tracks from the album can be heard on the 2000 release Trampled by Lambs and Pecked by the Dove, a collection of song sketches and demos recorded by Anastasio and Marshall.

Jason Ankeny of AllMusic praised the album as Phish's \\"rootsiest and most organic effort to date... [and] also their most fully developed ‚Äì these are complete, concise songs and not simply outlines for extended jams, boasting a beauty and intimacy which expands the group's scope even as it serves notice of a newfound pop accessibility.\\" Rolling Stones Jon Pareles, however, gave Farmhouse a mediocre rating of only 2.5 stars. The review states that on the album the band walks \\"a thin line between mellow and torpid\\" with songs that \\"are going to need a lot of live (concert) resuscitation\\".

Born to a peasant family from Xiangtan, Hunan, Qi became a carpenter at 14, and learned to paint by himself. When he came across the Mustard Seed Garden Manual of Painting, that sparked his interest to paint. He did not start learning painting and calligraphy until he was 27. After he turned 40, he traveled, visiting various scenic spots in China. After 1917 he settled in Beijing. Some of Qi's major influences include the early Qing dynasty painter Bada Shanren () and the Ming dynasty artist Xu Wei (). His pseudonyms include Q√≠ Hu√°ng () and Q√≠ W√®iqƒ´ng (). The subjects of his paintings include almost everything, commonly animals, scenery, figures, toys, vegetables, and so on. He theorized that \\"paintings must be something between likeness and unlikeness, much like today's vulgarians, but not like to cheat popular people\\". In his later years, many of his works depict mice, shrimp or birds. He was also good at seal carving and called himself \\"the rich man of three hundred stone seals\\" (). In 1953, he was elected president of the China Artists Association (). He died in Beijing in 1957. Early life He was born in Xiangtan, Hunan and grew up in a family of low-income background. He lived with his parents, grandparents, and eight younger sisters and brothers. Qi was schooled for less than a year due to illness. However, he was too weak to do much of the work and this was when he became a carpenter. While Qi was growing up, he came upon a Chinese manual of painting, this was what sparked his interest in art and painting animals, insects and other types. In his paintings, he depicted things that people have seen, however, he didn‚Äôt start following this motto until much later in his life. He first studied the Manual of the Mustard Seed Garden () and used performers, mainly opera, for models to practice his work. After using opera performers as models, Qi turned to anyone he knew to pose for him. Training and education Painting of a cicada by Qi Baishi ‚ÄúQi Baishi started receiving artistic training from Hu Qinyuan (ËÉ°Ê≤ÅÂúí) which consisted of fundamentals in gongbi (Â∑•Á≠Ü) mode, which features fine brushwork and meticulous detail‚Äù (Jung Ying Tsao p. 199). He was taught that every aspect of painting mattered, from the subject matter to the way the ink was applied to the paper. His landscape paintings came as a result of his next mentor Tan Pu. Because of his training, he then realized that he could pursue art as his full-time career instead of just dreaming to become a professional artist (Jung Ying Tsao p. 199-201). Despite his training in gongbi, Qi is famed for painting in the freely expressive xieyi (ÂØ´ÊÑè ‚Äòsketching thoughts‚Äô) style. Qi was popular for his variety of works ranging from plant to animal life; because of his natural style, collectors both ‚Äúartistic and political‚Äù purchased his work. According to the article, Qi Baishi [Ch‚Äôi Pai-shih; zi Huang; hao Baishi Laoren, Baishi Shanqeng]: \\"Qi‚Äôs works were based on his life and his character. After the fall of the Qing dynasty Qi was known for not letting all the political issues affect his work and keeping his own values and ideas through the harsh times. According to Confucian standards, starting off as nothing and creating a name for yourself, as Qi did, was very honorable (Xiangtan p. 1). Qi managed to master many different techniques including calligraphy and seal-carving. After establishing himself in Hunan as a painter and artist, it wasn‚Äôt until his forties that he began traveling and looking for more inspiration. Qi came upon the Shanghai School, which was very popular at the time, and met Wu Changshuo who then became another mentor to him and inspired a lot of Qi‚Äôs works. Another influence of Qi didn‚Äôt come until about fifteen years later who was Chen Shizeng (Èô≥Â∏´Êõæ) who he became close to when he was living in Beijing. Qi was becoming more and more well-known and sought after. During World War II, many traditional art works and culture were no longer considered valuable and were thus destroyed. But Qi was still respected and was ‚Äúelected to the National People‚Äôs Congress and made honorary Chairman of the National Artist‚Äôs‚Äô Association, he represented a continuing commitment to traditional cultural values in revolutionary China‚Äù (Xiangtan, p. 1). He died at age 93. Settling down After all of his travels, Qi built a house and settled down. He began reading and writing poetry and painting some of the mountains he saw while traveling. These paintings became a series of fifty landscape pictures known as ‚ÄúChieh-shan t‚Äôu-chuan.‚Äù Later, poems and postscripts by artists that Qi knew were printed onto the paintings (Boorman & Howard p. 302-304). One of Qi‚Äôs earlier series of works called ‚ÄúThe Carp‚Äù was recognized and praised for its simple style - it contained no excess of decorations or writings. His noticeable talent with wood-carving was also highly praised, as was his ability to express his personal influence through his work. It wasn‚Äôt until his mid-fifties that Qi was considered a mature painter. By then, his lines were sharper and his subject matter had changed from wildlife to botany. As said by Wang Chao-Wen, ‚Äúhe based his work on reality while experimenting ceaselessly in new ways of expression, to integrate truth and beauty, create something yet unimagined by other artists, and achieve his own unique style, on that should not be artificial‚Äù (p. 127). Experiences and works Monument in Qi Baishi Park, Xiangtan Wang Chao-Wen said that while Qi was talking to a student in Beijing, he saw an outline of a bird on a brick floor in muddy water. He goes on to say that not everyone would have seen the bird, but because Qi was always concerned with finding new images to paint, he had a ‚Äúspecial sensitivity‚Äù (p. 129). It was said that Qi had something special about him because he was constantly thinking about painting and had such a strong drive and motivation to be a great artist. (Chao-Wen p. 90698) Excerpts from Qi Baishi‚Äôs journal demonstrate the strong passion and conviction he had for his work. From the article ‚ÄúAn Appreciation of Chi Pai-Shi‚Äôs Paintings,‚Äù (Baishi was previously known as Chi Pai-Shi) his journal entry reads as follows: ‚ÄúWhen I cut seals I do not abide by the old rules, and so I am accused of unorthodoxy. But I pity this generation‚Äôs stupidity, for they do not seem to realize that the Chin and Han artists were human and so are we, and we may have our unique qualities too‚Ä¶ Such classical artists as Ching-teng, Hsueh-ko and Ta-ti-tzu dared to make bold strokes in their paintings, for which I admire them tremendously. My one regret is that I was not born three hundred years ago, for then I could have asked to grind ink or hold the paper for those gentleman, and if they would not have me I should have starved outside their doors rather than move away. How wonderful that would have been! I suppose future generations will admire our present artists just as much as we admire these men of old. What a pity that I will not be there to see it!‚Äù (Wang Chao-Wen p. 130-131) What is unique about Qi is that his works show no western influences, unlike most other artists at this time. Other artists praised Qi for the ‚Äúfreshness and spontaneity that he brought to the familiar genres of birds and flowers, insects and grasses, hermit-scholars and landscapes‚Äù (Xiangtan, p. 2). Although Qi wasn‚Äôt the first artist to focus on small things in nature, he was highly recognized for his thoughtful and lyrical approach in depicting these subjects. Forgery and misattribution of Qi's work has become common in the contemporary art market.Qi Baishi, Dead, Keeps Making Art at MuseumZero; published November 25, 2013; retrieved January 9, 2014Replicas flood China's auctions as art becomes a business , at Want China Times; published October 25, 2012; retrieved October 28, 2013 He is estimated to have produced between 8,000 and 15,000 distinct works throughout his life, of which 3,000 are in museums; however, since 1993, auction houses have attempted to sell over 18,000 distinct works attributed to him. A painting attributed to him, Eagle Standing on Pine Tree, was sold for 425.5 million yuan ($65.5 million) in 2011, becoming one of the most expensive paintings ever sold at auction. However, doubts over the painting's authenticity were later raised by the bidder.A Culture of Bidding: Forging an Art Market in China, at the New York Times; by David Barboza, Graham Bowley, Amanda Cox, and Jo Craven McGinty; published October 28, 2013; retrieved October 28, 2013 The market for Qi's paintings has made headlines in the art market, both for China and the world. In 2016, his works held the second position by value (third by number of lots to sale) by auction. At the end of 2017, the art world was rocked by the news that his Twelve Landscape Screens (1925) catapulted him into the '$100 Million Club' by selling for $140.8 million (931.5 million yuan) at the Poly Auctions in Beijing, China. Family In 1881, at age 18, Qi completed his apprenticeship and married his child bride Chen Chunjun (1874-1940) in his Hunan hometown. The couple had five children, three sons: Qi Liangyuan (born 1889), Qi Liangfu (1894-1913) and Qi Liangkun (born 1902) and two daughters (unknown names). In 1919, Chen Chunjun came to Beijing and obtained Hu Baozhu (1902-1944) as Qi's concubine. Since then, Qi and Hu lived together in Beijing. The couple had 7 children together. Four sons: Qi Liangchi (born 1921), Qi Liangyi (born 1923), Qi Liangnian (1934-1938) and Qi Liangmo (born 1938, nowadays lives in Beijing) and 3 daughters: Qi Lianglian (born 1927), Qi Lianghuan (born 1928) and Qi Liangzhi (1931-2010).Xiong Zhichun Interview in Helsinki, Finland 2013 Heritage There were/are many painters of Qi's young generation: Qi and Chen‚Äôs children: * Qi Liangkun (also known Qi Ziru) and his son Qi Kelai.

Although the band played \\"Part II\\" throughout 1994, Phish retired the song in favor of the original version of \\"Axilla\\" in 1995. The outro jam segment of \\"Down with Disease\\" had been debuted by the band at midnight at their New Year's Eve 1993-94 concert, but the entire song was not played live until April 1994. Hoist features guest appearances from Alison Krauss, B√©la Fleck, Tower of Power, Rose Stone and a host of other musicians, as well as actor Jonathan Frakes on trombone. With its jazz, blues, soul and bluegrass influences, the album is marked by more stripped-down, straightforward songwriting and pop-friendly hooks, a somewhat new approach for Phish. However, the album's final track, \\"Demand\\", segues into an extended eight-minute instrumental excerpt from a live performance of the song \\"Split Open and Melt\\" from the band's April 21, 1993 concert at the Newport Music Hall in Columbus, Ohio. The \\"Split\\" jam is then abruptly cut off by the sound of a car crash followed by the first verse and refrain of the Hebrew song \\"Yerushalayim Shel Zahav (Jerusalem of Gold).\\"Phish.net: Hoist Online. Accessed: August 12, 2011. \\"Riker's Mailbox\\" is a brief interlude track on the album, and the only \\"song\\" on the album to have never been performed live by the band. Album producer Paul Fox lived next to Jonathan Frakes, whose mailbox is apparently uniquely decorated. Frakes, who played Commander Riker on Star Trek: The Next Generation, sat in for a while during the Hoist sessions, giving his name to the track.Phish.net Song History: Riker's Mailbox Online. Accessed: August 12, 2011. The \\"Riker's Mailbox\\" track is a extracted from a longer take of the song \\"Buffalo Bill\\", which had been recorded during the Hoist sessions but did not make the album's tracklist. On June 26, 1994, the band performed the entire Hoist album (minus \\"Riker's Mailbox\\" but including the \\"Split Open and Melt\\" jam) verbatim as the second set of their live show in Charleston, West Virginia. The first set of the concert had featured the band performing their \\"Gamehendge\\" song suite in its entirety, and as a result, the concert is known by fans as the \\"GameHoist\\" show. This move was a subversion of Phish's usual improvisationally driven performances, and the concert later inspired the band's tradition of donning a musical costume for Halloween.Phish.net Setlists: 1994-06-26 Online.

It is a resident breeding bird in most of Africa south of the Sahara Desert. Taxonomy The pin-tailed whydah was first described by the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas in 1764 and given the binomial name Fringilla macroura. Includes a transcript of the 1764 text. Description The pin-tailed whydah is 12‚Äì13 cm in length, although the breeding male's tail adds another 20 cm to this. The adult male has a black back and crown, and a very long black tail. The wings are dark brown with white patches, and the underparts and the head, apart from the crown, are white. The bill is bright red. The female and non-breeding male have streaked brown upperparts, whitish underparts with buff flanks, and a buff and black face pattern. They lack the long tail extension, but retain the red bill. Immature birds are like the female but plainer and with a greyish bill.

In Portugal it is established in the region around Aveiro, with observations occurring north and south of it.Viuvinha-bico-de-lacre ‚Äì Aves de Portugal It has also been introduced to southern California, Puerto Rico, and Singapore. Ecology The species is a brood parasite which lays its eggs in the nests of estrildid finches, especially waxbills. Unlike the common cuckoo, it does not destroy the host's eggs. Typically, 2‚Äì4 eggs are added to those already present. The eggs of both the host and the whydah are white, although the whydah's are slightly larger. The nestling whydahs mimic the gape pattern of the fledglings of the host species. The male pin-tailed whydah is territorial, and one male often has several females in his small group. He has an elaborate courtship flight display, which includes hovering over the female to display his tail. The song is given from a high perch, and consists of rapid squeaking and churring. The diet of this species consists of seeds and grain. References Further reading Pin-tailed whydah ‚Äì Species text in The Atlas of Southern African Birds.

The album was recorded over the span of four days in October 2002, and its release marked the end of the group's two year hiatus from touring and recording. Production and release Initially, Phish planned to record the album live at their December 31, 2002 concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City, their first concert since October 2000, but they decided instead to release the songs they had recorded that fall instead. As with previous Phish albums, the songs originated in collaborative writing sessions between frontman Trey Anastasio and lyricist Tom Marshall (with two songs contributed by bass guitarist Mike Gordon). Round Room is unique, however, in that the final tracks were taken from the band's unedited rehearsal sessions at The Barn, Anastasio's studio in Vermont. Rolling Stone notes that this approach gives the album a \\"decidedly live\\" feeling, and \\"breathes with an anxious, edge-of-the-seat intensity that's missing from their previous studio efforts.\\" Though largely positive, the review criticizes Anastasio's singing and the \\"Phishspeak\\" quality of the lyrics. In the liner notes for the album, Round Room is dedicated to the memory of Widespread Panic guitarist Michael Houser, who died in August 2002, and Scott Schertzer, a Phish fan who was killed in the September 11 attacks in 2001.

Smithsonian Institution building, Washington, D.C., 1864. From the Liljenquist Family Collection of Civil War Photographs, Prints and Photographs Division, Library of Congress The Smithsonian Institution Building, located near the National Mall in Washington, D.C. behind the National Museum of African Art and the Sackler Gallery, houses the Smithsonian Institution's administrative offices and information center. The building is constructed of Seneca red sandstone in the Norman Revival style (a 12th-century combination of late Romanesque and early Gothic motifs; built in the Gothic and Romanesque revival styles) and is nicknamed The Castle. It was completed in 1855 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965. History The Castle was the first Smithsonian building, designed by architect James Renwick, Jr., whose other works include St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City and the Smithsonian's Renwick Gallery, also in Washington D.C. The building committee held a nationwide design competition in 1846 and selected Renwick's design by a unanimous vote. A cardboard model of Renwick's winning design survives and is on display in the Castle. Renwick was assisted by Robert Mills, particularly in the internal arrangement of the building. statue of Joseph Henry is displayed in front of the building. Initially intended to be built in white marble, then in yellow sandstone, the architect and building committee finally settled on Seneca red sandstone from the Seneca Quarry in Montgomery County, Maryland. The redstone was substantially less expensive than granite or marble, and while initially easy to work, was found to harden to a satisfactory degree on exposure to the elements. Scholarly evidence indicates it is likely that slaves were employed at Seneca in quarrying stone for the Castle, though no evidence has surfaced that slaves were involved in the actual Castle construction. The building committee selected Gilbert Cameron as the general contractor, and construction began in 1847. The East Wing was completed in 1849 and occupied by Secretary Joseph Henry and his family. The West Wing was completed later the same year. A structural collapse in 1850 of partly completed work raised questions of workmanship and resulted in a change to fireproof construction. The Castle's exterior was completed in 1852; Renwick's work was completed and he withdrew from further participation. Cameron continued the interior work, which he completed in 1855. Construction funds came from \\"accrued interest on the Smithson bequest.\\" Despite the upgraded fireproof construction, a fire in 1865 caused extensive damage to the upper floor of the building, destroying the correspondence of James Smithson, Henry's papers, two hundred oil paintings of American Indians by John Mix Stanley, the Regent's Room and the lecture hall, and the contents of the public libraries of Alexandria, Virginia and Beaufort, South Carolina, confiscated by Union forces during the American Civil War. The ensuing renovation was undertaken by local Washington architect Adolf Cluss in 1865-67. Further fireproofing work ensued in 1883, also by Cluss, who by this time had designed the neighboring Arts and Industries Building. A third and fourth floor were added to the East Wing, and a third floor to the West Wing. Electric lighting was installed in 1895. Around 1900 the wooden floor of the Great Hall was replaced with terrazzo and a Children's Museum was installed near the south entrance. A tunnel connected to the Arts and Industries Building. A general renovation took place in 1968-70 to install modern electrical systems, elevators and heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. The Enid A. Haupt Garden was dedicated in 1987, along with the Renwick Gate facing Independence Avenue, built from Seneca redstone retrieved from the demolished D.C. Jail. Description East entrance to the Smithsonian Institution Building James Renwick designed the Castle as the focal point of a picturesque landscape on the Mall, using elements from Georg Moller's Denkm√§ler der deutschen Baukunst. Renwick originally intended to detail the building with entirely American sculptural flora in the manner of Benjamin Henry Latrobe's work at the United States Capitol, but the final work used conventional pattern-book designs. The building is completed in the Gothic Revival style with Romanesque motifs. This style was chosen to evoke the Collegiate Gothic in England and the ideas of knowledge and wisdom. The fa√ßade is built with red sandstone from the Seneca quarry in Seneca, Maryland in contrast to the granite, marble and yellow sandstone from the other major buildings in Washington, D.C. The Castle c. 1870 The building comprises a central section, two extensions or ranges, and two wings. Four towers contain occupiable space, while five smaller towers are primarily decorative, although some contain stairs. As constructed, the central section contained the main entry and museum space (now the Great Hall), with a basement beneath and a large lecture room above. Two galleries on the second floor were used to display artifacts and art. This area is now the Visitor's Information and Associates' Reception area. The East Range contained laboratory space on the first floor and research space on the second. The East Wing contained storage space on the first floor and a suite of rooms on the second as an apartment for the Secretary of the Smithsonian. This space is currently used as administrative offices and archives. The West Range was one story and used as a reading room. The West Wing, known as the chapel, was used as a library. The West Wing and Range are now used as a quiet room for visitors to go. On the exterior, the principal tower on the south side is high and square. On the north side there are two towers, the taller on tall. A campanile at the northeast corner is square and tall. The plan allowed for expansion at either end, a major reason for the informal medievally-inspired design, which would not suffer if asymmetrically developed. Current use The Smithsonian Castle houses the administrative offices of the Smithsonian. The main Smithsonian visitor center is also located here, with interactive displays and maps. Computers electronically answer most common questions. A crypt just inside the north entrance houses the tomb of James Smithson.

In 2007, AiG opened the Creation Museum, a facility that promotes young-Earth creationism, and in 2016 the organization opened the Ark Encounter, a Noah's Ark‚Äìthemed amusement park. AiG also publishes websites, magazines, and journals, and its employees have published books. Organization Answers in Genesis resulted from the merging of two Australian creationist organizations in 1980, one led by John Mackay and Ken Ham and the other by Carl Wieland. The organization later become known as Answers in Genesis. It is based in Petersburg, Kentucky and has international offices in Australia, Canada, Peru, and the United Kingdom. Following turmoil in 2005, the AiG network split in 2006. The US and UK branches retained the AiG name and control of the AiG website under Ham's leadership. The Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and South African branches rebranded themselves as Creation Ministries International (CMI). In 2007, CMI filed suit against AiG-USA alleging a variety of wrongdoings, including publicly defaming their organization. In June 2006, Answers in Genesis launched the Answers magazine in the United States and United Kingdom, followed by the Answers Research Journal in 2008, which was widely criticized in the media and scientific circles. Also in 2006, the National Religious Broadcasters awarded Answers in Genesis their Best Ministry Website award. In May 2007, AiG launched the Creation Museum in the United States. The museum received criticism from the National Center for Science Education and petitions of protest from the scientific community. Views and activities From the outset, Ken Ham did not share the interest of other groups promoting creation science in aiming to produce evidence supporting young Earth creationism, although Answers in Genesis still maintain that \\"creation science is real science\\". Instead, Answers in Genesis focuses on presenting evangelicalism as an all-out battle of their biblical worldview against a perceived naturalistic scientific worldview. Ham's message has had three central points: * that teaching of evolution is an evil causing damage to society * that the first eleven chapters of the Book of Genesis give a precise description of the process of creation of the universe and provide direct instruction on the organization of society * that proper Christians must engage in a total conflict battling against atheistic humanism Answers in Genesis messages promote central young-Earth creationist doctrines, including the concepts of literal Creation of the Earth in six 24-hour days and effects of a global flood. Still, they focus mainly on accepting the authority of their particular literal reading of the Bible as a precondition for eternity in heaven. They present this as choosing one's personal ultimate authority for truth, with God's Word and human reason being the two possible options, and those choosing the latter over the former liable to perishment. They hence introduce the concept of \\"biblical reasoning\\", where one is \\"never to attempt to reason in opposition to the Word of God\\", and thus claim that this biblical reasoning and biblical faith \\"work very well together\\". The Answers in Genesis organization rejects key scientific facts and theories as established by archeology, cosmology, geology, paleontology and evolutionary biology and argues that the universe, the Earth and life originated about 6,000 years ago. (Creationism beliefs reject natural causes and events in scientific explanations of nature and of the origin of the universe in favor of the supernatural, and the Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that creationism is religion.NAS 1999, Science and Creationism: A View from the National Academy of Sciences - Second Edition, 1999 - \\"In 1987 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that creationism is religion, not science, and cannot be advocated in public school classrooms.\\" ) A book published by one of AiG's employees in 2006 accused Hollywood of using subtle tactics to slip \\"evolutionary content\\" into SpongeBob SquarePants, Lilo & Stitch and Finding Nemo, affirming that \\"As Christians we need to reflect the Bible's standards and not Hollywood's perverted version of reality.\\"Kerby 2006, pp. 9‚Äì10 Creation Museum The Creation Museum AiG's Creation Museum is a museum displaying a Young-Earth creationist worldview and pseudoarchaeology. The facility has received much criticism from the scientific and religious communities, as well as from cultural commentators. The Creation Museum opened May 27, 2007, at a cost of $27 million raised entirely by private donations. The displays were created by Patrick Marsh, known for work on Universal Studios Florida attractions for King Kong and Jaws. A. A. Gill, a British writer and critic, described the museum as \\"battling science and reason since 2007\\", writing: \\"This place doesn't just take on evolution‚Äîit squares off with geology, anthropology, paleontology, history, chemistry, astronomy, zoology, biology, and good taste. It directly and boldly contradicts most -onomies and all -ologies, including most theology.\\" In 2012 a report noted that \\"public fascination\\" with the Creation Museum was \\"fading\\". In November 2012 AiG reported that attendance for the year ended June 30 came to 254,074, which represented a 10 percent drop from the previous year and the attraction's \\"fourth straight year of declining attendance and its lowest annual attendance yet.\\" By mid-2015, 2.4 million people had visited the museum [about 340,000 visitors over seven years]. Ark Encounter Noah's Ark at Ark Encounter Answers in Genesis opened Ark Encounter, a theme-park, in Grant County, Kentucky on July 7, 2016. The centerpiece of the park is a full-scale model of Noah's Ark at long and high. After a visit to Ark Encounter, Bill Nye, who had previously debated Ham, described his experience as \\"much more troubling or disturbing than [he] thought it would be\\" and stated that \\"on the Ark's third deck, every single science exhibit is absolutely wrong\\".Bill Nye Calls Ark Encounter 'Disturbing,' Argues 'Every Science Exhibit Absolutely Wrong' After Visit, Christian Post, July 18, 2006 In December 2016, for the holiday season, AiG lit the Ark with rainbow colors, aiming to \\"reclaim the symbol from the gay rights movement\\" and to remind viewers of the Noahic covenant. By late October 2016, over 400,000 people had visited the attraction.See also: This contrasts a state study that projected the attraction would receive 325,000 to under 500,000 visitors in the first year. AiG reported that the Ark Encounter in its first year of operation attracted over 1 million visitors and aggregated 1.5 million total visitors for both the Ark and the Creation Museum. Workforce In 2007 about 160 people including a chaplain worked at the Creation Museum (a division of AiG, so these were AiG employees) and another 140 people worked at the attached AiG headquarters.\\"Dinosaurs, humans coexist in creationist museum\\".

April 15, 2007Jobs at Answers in Genesis. Accessed May 28, 2007. In 2007, The Kentucky Post reported that the Creation Museum employed between 10 and 20 security guards armed with .40 caliber Glock handguns and three certified law enforcement canines. Creationist geologist Andrew A. Snelling started working with AiG in 2007 as its director of research. Criticism Creation science, which is supported by AiG, is a pseudoscience that \\"lacks the central defining characteristic of all modern scientific theories\\". Scientific and scholarly organizations, including the National Academy of Sciences, Paleontological Society, Geological Society of America, Australian Academy of Science, and the Royal Society of Canada have issued statements against the teaching of creationism. The National Center for Science Education, a science advocacy group, criticize AiG's promotion of non- science. In direct response to AiG, No Answers in Genesis is a website maintained by members of the Australian Skeptics and retired civil servant John Stear for the purpose of rebutting claims made by AiG. Astronomer Hugh Ross's organization Reasons To Believe, a progressive creationist organization, is a critic of Answers in Genesis. The BioLogos Foundation, which promotes evolutionary creationism, has stated that the views of Answers in Genesis have \\"force[d] many thoughtful Christians to lose their faith,\\" while The Biologos Foundation \\"protect[s the Christian] faith.\\". Controversies Richard Dawkins interview In 1998, Answers in Genesis filmed an interview with Richard Dawkins, a prominent evolutionary biologist at Oxford University, resulting in a controversial video that AiG posted on its website. Dawkins addressed it in the essay: \\"The 'Information Challenge'\\", published in A Devil's Chaplain in 2003. The \\"suspiciously amateurish\\" interview included, according to Dawkins, \\"the kind of question only a creationist would ask in that way\\" (namely, to \\"give an example of a genetic mutation or an evolutionary process which can be seen to increase the information in the genome\\"). Realizing that he had been duped, Dawkins, at his admission, was angry at the thought and initially refused to answer the question, but relented and continued the interview. Dawkins wrote: \\"My generosity was rewarded in a fashion that anyone familiar with fundamentalist tactics might have predicted. When I eventually saw the film a year later, I found that it had been edited to give the false impression that I was incapable of answering the question about information content. In fairness, this may not have been quite as intentionally deceitful as it sounds. You have to understand that these people really believe that their question cannot be answered!\\" The Australian Skeptics wrote that the film was edited to give the appearance that Dawkins was unable to \\"give an example of a genetic mutation or an evolutionary process which can be seen to increase the information in the genome\\" and that a segment that shows him pausing for 11 seconds was a film of him considering whether to expel the interviewer from the room for not revealing her creationist sympathies at the outset. Dawkins reported to the Australian Skeptics that the interviewer shown in the finished film was not the same person who had originally asked the questions. Dawkins and Barry Williams also said that the question had been subsequently changed to make it look like Dawkins, who answered the original question put to him, was unable to answer. Legal action by Creation Ministries Int'l On May 31, 2007, Creation Ministries International filed a lawsuit in Supreme Court of Queensland against Ken Ham and Answers in Genesis seeking damages and accusing him of \\"unbiblical/unethical/unlawful behaviour\\" in his dealings with the Australian organization. Before the split, the Australian group had been producing periodicals, Creation magazine and Journal of Creation, which were then distributed within other countries by local groups. The Australian group had no access to the list of subscribers in the US. AiG discontinued the distribution arrangement, and produced a new magazine of their own, called Answers, and represented that to subscribers as a replacement. Creation Ministries International was claiming $252,000 (US) in damages for lost revenue by misleading and deceptive conduct in relating to lost subscriptions. Photocopy supplied at the CMI website; official court file summary here. In comments to news reporters, Ken Ham dismisses CMI's accusations as \\"totally preposterous and untrue\\". Creation Ministries has made a large collection of documents available detailing their side of the case. An editorial analysis of the situation, including reference to estranged co-founder John Mackay's allegations in 1986 of necrophilia and witchcraft against Ken Ham's personal secretary is offered in an account in the Reports of the National Center for Science Education. In February 2009, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ordered Australian-based Creation Ministries International into arbitration with Answers in Genesis over copyrights and control of affiliates in other countries. In April 2009, the ministries reached a settlement and ended their dispute. Anti-atheism billboards In the spring of 2009, Answers in Genesis posted a billboard in Texas with a young boy aiming a gun towards the camera with the words \\"If God doesn't matter to him, do you?\\" The same image was used in a TV ad. In 2014, the organization purchased space in Times Square to run a 15-second video advertisement addressed \\"To all of our intolerant liberal friends\\". According to AiG, the goal of the billboard was to \\"challenge the secularists who are increasingly intolerant of the Christian message\\". The Christian Relevant Magazine described the ad as \\"passive-aggressive\\" and \\"weirdly combative\\".Here's the Controversial Billboard 'Answers in Genesis' Is Displaying in Times Square Tonight , Relevant Magazine, 2014 Great Homeschool Conventions In March 2011, the Board of Great Homeschool Conventions, Inc. (a young Earth Christian group) voted to disinvite Ken Ham and AiG from future conventions due to Ham's words about other Christians making \\"unnecessary, ungodly, and mean-spirited statements that are divisive at best and defamatory at worst\\". The controversy stemmed from Ham's commentary on the position expressed by Peter Enns, of The BioLogos Foundation, who advocated a symbolic rather than a literal interpretation of the fall of Adam and Eve. Writing on his blog, Ham accused Enns of espousing \\"outright liberal theology that totally undermines the authority of the Word of God\\", which led to his invitation being revoked.

Jim√©nez as an astronaut, 1963. Jos√© Jim√©nez was a fictional character created and performed by comedian Bill Dana on The Steve Allen Show in 1959 and who became increasingly popular during the 1960s. This character introduced himself with the catch phrase: \\"My name...Jos√© Jim√©nez\\". Dana played Jos√© in three non-variety shows: Make Room for Daddy, which spun off The Bill Dana Show, and a cameo in an episode of Batman (\\"The Yegg Foes in Gotham\\", October 20, 1966). Astronaut During the course of his Jos√© Jim√©nez acts, Bill Dana (who was of Hungarian-Jewish ancestry, unlike the Bolivian character he played) took his character through various roles including elevator operator, sailor, and submariner until settling into the most famous occupation that Jos√© would hold: astronaut. An excerpt from The Ed Sullivan Show: > Jos√© Jim√©nez: \\"My name... Jos√© Jim√©nez.\\" Ed Sullivan: \\"Well, now I see you > have some of your space equipment with you. Uh, what is that called, the > crash helmet?\\" Jos√© Jim√©nez: \\"Oh, I hope not.\\" > Ed Sullivan: \\"Now, what do you consider the most important thing in rocket > travel?\\" Jos√© Jim√©nez: \\"To me the most important thing in the rocket travel > is the blast-off.\\" Ed Sullivan: \\"The blast-off.\\" Jos√© Jim√©nez: \\"I always > take a blast before I take off. Otherwise I wouldn't go near that thing.\\" The routine was later released as a double-sided single: \\"The Astronaut (Part 1 and 2)\\" made the Billboard charts, peaking at #19 in September 1961. Writer/producer Don Hinkley (who Dana had met when they were writers for the Allen show) played the part of the newscaster, asking Jos√© questions about his purported spaceflight. An LP, Jos√© Jiminez in Orbit (Bill Dana on Earth) (Kapp KL-1257), featuring similar routines, was issued in 1962. The character of Jos√© Jim√©nez caught on with the seven real Mercury astronauts, and Dana became good friends with them: \\"Okay, Jos√©, you're on your way!\\" Deke Slayton quipped as Alan Shepard's famous first flight launched. Jos√© became the program's unofficial mascot, and Dana was even made an honorary Mercury astronaut. (Coincidentally, there was a real test pilot named Bill Dana, who flew as high as 59 miles up and qualified for NASA's Astronaut Badge.) Decline As time passed, Dana realized that such ethnic humor was becoming offensive, and Hispanic groups began protesting Dana's portrayal of the dim-witted Hispanic character. In 1970, Dana announced to a Mexican-American cultural pride festival that \\"after tonight, Jos√© Jim√©nez is dead\\", later holding a mock funeral for Jos√© on Sunset Boulevard. In 1997 Dana received an image award from the National Hispanic Media Coalition.  Jos√© Jim√©nez in popular culture  In the 1983 film The Right Stuff, Alan Shepard (played by Scott Glenn) is a fan of the character and uses the catchphrase in radio talk while piloting his airplane in for a carrier landing. Later he is warned by a very large, rather intimidating Hispanic medical aide (played by Anthony Mu√±oz) that the way he uses it is offending people, and he stops. Footage of the character's appearance as an astronaut on The Ed Sullivan Show was also seen in the film. In the 1987 film The Pink Chiquitas, one of the characters reads a passage from a book describing an expedition by the \\"explorer\\" Jos√© Jim√©nez. In his demo of the song \\"Wonderful Toys\\" written for the aborted Batman musical, Jim Steinman does a parody of Eminem, which includes the lines \\"My name is‚Äîmy name is‚Äîmy names is‚ÄîJos√© Jim√©nez!\\". The song is meant to be sung by The Joker. In the Farscape season 4 episode, \\"Unrealized Reality\\", the lead character, John Crichton (who commonly quotes pop culture throughout his misadventures), experiences another possible reality of a scene from the first episode of the series. When asked his name, instead of saying John Crichton he replies, \\"My name Jos√© Jim√©nez.\\" In the television show Mystery Science Theater 3000, the puppet character of Crow uses the phrase \\"My name Jos√© Jim√©nez.\\" In the third episode of the HBO miniseries From the Earth to the Moon, called \\"We Have Cleared the Tower\\", someone mentions Bill Dana during the Apollo 7 pre-launch breakfast. This inspires Commander Wally Schirra (played by Mark Harmon) to recite some of Jos√© Jim√©nez's lines, to the great amusement of everyone at the table. In a cameo appearance in the Get Smart episode, \\"Supersonic Boom\\", Dana alludes indirectly to Jim√©nez, in that his only line was \\"Sorry fella, don't speak Spanish. Boy, are you in the wrong neighborhood.\\" In season 4 episode 10 of The Larry Sanders Show, Arthur argues that Jos√© had been an inspiration to children because he was the \\"first Hispanic in space\\". In the episode \\"Day One\\" of The Wonder Years, Kevin Arnold's teacher calls him, \\"a regular Jos√© Jim√©nez\\" when Kevin interrupts a class lecture. Earlier in the episode Kevin made a joke and embarrassed the same teacher. In the Seinfeld episode \\"The Boyfriend\\", (season 3, episode 17), George Constanza goes to an unemployment office, where he nervously does an impression of Jos√© Jim√©nez. Ventriloquist Jeff Dunham has performed with a pepper-shaped puppet named \\"Jos√© Jalape√±o,\\" described as \\"almost indistinguishable\\" from Jos√© Jim√©nez.

Coordination and communication problems resulted in friendly fire deaths during the exercise, and an Allied convoy positioning itself for the landing was attacked by E-boats of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine, resulting in the deaths of at least 749 American servicemen. Because of the impending invasion of Normandy, the incident was under the strictest secrecy at the time and was only nominally reported afterwards. Exercise Landing operations In late 1943, as part of the build-up to D-day, the British government set up a training ground at Slapton Sands, Devon, to be used by Force \\"U\\", the American forces tasked with landing on Utah Beach. Slapton Beach was selected for its similarity to Utah Beach: a gravel beach, followed by a strip of land and then a lake. Approximately 3,000 local residents in the area of Slapton, now South Hams District of Devon, were evacuated. Some had never left their villages before being evacuated. Landing exercises started in December 1943. Exercise Tiger was one of the larger exercises that took place in April and May 1944. The exercise was to last from 22 April until 30 April 1944, and covered all aspects of the invasion, culminating in a beach landing at Slapton Sands. On board nine large tank landing ships (LSTs), the 30,000 troops prepared for their mock landing, which also included a live-firing exercise. Protection for the exercise area came from the Royal Navy. Two destroyers, three Motor Torpedo Boats and two Motor Gun Boats patrolled the entrance to Lyme Bay and Motor Torpedo Boats watched the Cherbourg area where German E-boats were based. The first phase of the exercise focused on marshalling and embarkation drills, and lasted from 22 to 25 April. On the evening of 26 April the first wave of assault troops boarded their transports and set off, the plan being to simulate the Channel crossing by taking a roundabout route through Lyme Bay, in order to arrive off Slapton at first light on 27 April. Friendly fire incident The first practice assault took place on the morning of 27 April and was marked by an incident involving friendly fire. H-hour was set for 07:30, and was to include live ammunition to acclimatize the troops to the sights, sounds and even smells of a naval bombardment. During the landing itself, live rounds were to be fired over the heads of the incoming troops by forces on land, for the same reason. This followed an order made by General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander, who felt that the men must be hardened by exposure to real battle conditions. The exercise was to include naval bombardment by ships of Force U Bombardment Group fifty minutes prior to the landing. Several of the landing ships for that morning were delayed, and the officer in charge, American Admiral Don P. Moon, decided to delay H-hour for 60 minutes, until 08:30. Some of the landing craft did not receive word of the change. Landing on the beach at their original scheduled time, the second wave came under fire, suffering an unknown number of casualties. Rumours circulated along the fleet that as many as 450 men were killed. Battle of Lyme Bay On the day after the first practice assaults, early on the morning of 28 April, the exercise was blighted when Convoy T-4, consisting of eight LSTs carrying vehicles and combat engineers of the 1st Engineer Special Brigade, was attacked by German E-boats in Lyme Bay Nine German E-boats had left Cherbourg shortly after midnight, avoiding the British MTBs watching the port area and the patrols in the English Channel. Around 0130 hrs six E-boats of the 5. S-Boot Flottille (5th E-Boat Flotilla) commanded by Korvettenkapit√§n Bernd Klug saw eight dark ships and split into three pairs to attack with torpedoes: first Rotte 3 (S-136 & S-138), then Rotte 2 under Oberleutnant zur See Goetschke (S-140 & S-142), then Rotte 1 (S-100 & S-143). The final three E-boats of the nine, S-Boot Flottille commanded by Korvettenkapit√§n G√∂tz Freiherr von Mirbach (S-130, S-145 & S-150), saw the red flares for attack (or may have heard the contact report sent at 0203 hrs) and joined the attack. After, within the Rotte 1 pair, S-100 collided with S-143 and damaged its superstructure, the boats decided to leave, masking their retreat with smoke while sending another contact report. S-145 attacked the ships with gunfire. The attack ended circa at 0330 hrs. The Germans had been puzzled by the strange-looking ships which did not look like merchantmen. They estimated that they were some type of American landing ship with a shallow draft as the initial torpedoes from Rotte 3 and Rotte 2 seemed to miss. Of the two ships assigned to protect the convoy, only one was present. , a corvette, was leading the LSTs in a straight line, a formation that later drew criticism since it presented an easy target to the E-boats. The second ship that was supposed to be present, , a World War I destroyer, had been in a collision with an LST, suffered structural damage and left the convoy to be repaired at Plymouth. Because the LSTs and British naval headquarters were operating on different frequencies, the American forces did not know this. was dispatched as a replacement, but did not arrive in time to help protect the convoy.

The remaining ships and their escort fired back and the E-boats made no more attacks. In total, 749 servicemen (551 United States Army and 198 United States Navy) were killed during Exercise Tiger. Many servicemen drowned or died of hypothermia in the cold sea while waiting to be rescued. Many had not been shown how to put on their lifebelt correctly, and placed it around their waist, the only available spot because of their large backpacks. In some cases this meant that when they jumped into the water, the weight of their combat packs flipped them upside down, dragging their heads under water and drowning them. Dale Rodman, who travelled on LST-507, commented: \\"The worst memory I have is setting off in the lifeboat away from the sinking ship and watching bodies float by.\\" The 248 bodies that were recovered were sent to Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey on 29 April. The unit with the most casualties was the 1st Special Engineer Brigade.Army Quartermaster Museum- TIGER‚ÄîThe E-Boat Attack qmmuseum.lee.army.mil, accessed 29 August 2019 Aftermath The attack was reported up the chain of command to both Erwin Rommel and Dwight D. Eisenhower on 29 April. Eisenhower was enraged that the convoy was sailing in a straight line and not zig-zagging, that the attack reduced reserves of LSTs, that it indicated to the Germans that the Allies were nearly ready to invade, and that ten American officers with knowledge of the invasion were missing. The missing officers had BIGOT- level clearance for D-Day, meaning that they knew the invasion plans and could have compromised the invasion should they have been captured alive. As a result, the invasion was nearly called off until the bodies of all ten victims were found. He ordered that all the officers‚Äô bodies, and any incriminating papers they might have had, be found. The ten American officers were from the 1st Engineer Special Brigade; they knew when and where the Utah and Omaha landings were to take place, and had seen the amphibious DUCKWs that were to take the Rangers to below Pointe du Hoc. There were reports that S-boats were nosing through the wreckage for information with searchlights or torches. The shore batteries around nearby Salcombe Harbour had visually spotted unidentified small craft, but were ordered not to fire on them as it would have shown the Germans that the harbour was defended and disclosed the battery position. As it was, the mere similarity between Slapton Sands and the Calvados coast caused Adolf Hitler to deduce that the exercise was a practice for a landing in Normandy and to insist on the need to reinforce lower Normandy.Harrison, Gordon, Cross-Channel Attack, Office of the Chief of Military History, Department of the Army, Washington, D. C., 1951, p. 259. As a result of official embarrassment and concerns over potential leaks just prior to the real invasion, all survivors were sworn to secrecy about the events by their superiors. There is little information about exactly how individual soldiers and sailors died. The US Department of Defense stated in 1988 that record-keeping may have been inadequate aboard some of the ships, and the most pertinent log books were lost at sea. A ninth LST () was scheduled to be in the convoy, but was damaged. Author Nigel Lewis speculates that some or all of its infantrymen may have been aboard LST 507 when it went down. Various eyewitness accounts detail hasty treatment of casualties and rumours circulated of unmarked mass graves in Devon fields. Several changes resulted from mistakes made in Exercise Tiger: # Radio frequencies were standardised; the British escort vessels were late and out of position due to radio problems, and a signal about the E-boats' presence was not picked up by the LSTs. # Better life vest training was provided for landing troops # Plans were made for small craft to pick up floating survivors on D-Day. Official histories contain little information about the tragedy. Some commentators have called it a cover-up, but the initial critical secrecy about Tiger may have merely resulted in longer-term quietude. In his book The Forgotten Dead: Why 946 American Servicemen Died Off The Coast Of Devon In 1944 ‚Äì And The Man Who Discovered Their True Story, published in 1988, Ken Small declares that the event \\"was never covered up; it was 'conveniently forgotten'\\". The casualty statistics from Tiger were not released by Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) until August 1944, along with the casualties of the actual D-Day landings. This report stated that there were 442 army dead and 197 navy, for a total of 639. (However, Moon had reported on 30 April that there were 749 dead.) Charles B. MacDonald, author and former deputy chief historian at the U.S. Army Center of Military History, notes that information from the SHAEF press release appeared in the August issue of Stars and Stripes. MacDonald surmises that the press release went largely unnoticed in light of the larger events that were occurring at the time. The story was detailed in at least three books at the end of the war, including Captain Harry C. Butcher's My Three Years With Eisenhower (1946), and in several publications and speeches. Memorials Sherman DD tank at the Torcross memorial Devon resident and civilian Ken Small took on the task of seeking to commemorate the event, after discovering evidence of the aftermath washed up on the shore while beachcombing in the early 1970s. In 1974, Small bought from the U.S. Government the rights to a submerged tank from the 70th Tank Battalion discovered in his search. In 1984, with the aid of local residents and diving firms, he raised the tank, which now stands as a memorial to the incident. The local authority provided a plinth on the seafront to put the tank on, and erected a plaque in memory of the men killed. The American military honoured and supported him. Small died of cancer in March 2004, a few weeks before the 60th anniversary of Exercise Tiger. A plaque was erected, in 1995, at Arlington National Cemetery entitled \\"Exercise Tiger Memorial\\". In 1997, the Exercise Tiger Association established a memorial to Exercise Tiger veterans in Mexico, Missouri. It is a 5,000-pound stern anchor from an LST of the Suffolk County Class on permanent loan from the Navy. In 2006, the Slapton Sands Memorial Tank Limited (a non-profit organisation, one of whose directors is Small's son Dean) established a more prominent memorial listing the names of all the victims of the attacks on Exercise Tiger. In 2012, a memorial plaque was erected at Utah Beach, Normandy, on the wall of a former German anti-aircraft bunker.

Saag can be made from mustard greens, collard greens, basella, finely chopped broccoli or other greens, along with added spices and sometimes other ingredients such as paneer. Saag is common in the state of Odisha, where it is eaten with pakhala. In the Shree Jagannath Temple of Puri, saag is one of the dishes offered to Jagannath as part of Mahaprasad. Saag is also common in West Bengal and other regions of North India, where the most common preparation is sarson da saag (mustard plant leaves), which may be eaten with makki di roti, a yellow roti made with maize flour. Saag aloo (spinach and potato) and saag gosht (spinach and goat) are common dishes in Punjabi cuisine, which are also served in restaurants and take-aways in the Western world (where the goat is commonly replaced with lamb).

Her early work emerged in the late 1980s and 1990s, \\"inverting the notion of background and foreground\\" in photography and bringing awareness to a viewer's attention to visual information with in the photographic frame. Her work is as much about vision and perception as it is about the failure to see, the faith humans place in the mechanics of perception, and the precarious nature of perceptual habits. Barth's says this about her art practice: ‚ÄúThe question for me always is how can I make you aware of your own looking, instead of losing your attention to thoughts about what it is that you are looking at.\\" She has been honored with two National Endowments of the Arts fellowships, was a recipient of the John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship in 2004‚Äë05, and was a 2012 MacArthur Fellow. Barth lives and works in Los Angeles, California. Early years and education Barth was born in Berlin, Germany in 1958. Growing up in Europe give Barth a different cultural perspective. Her memory of West Berlin is \\"dark and austere\\" and she left for the States before the Berlin wall was taken down in 1989. During early adolescence her father began a research project in the States at Stanford University and she moved to the US shortly after. Barth was 12 years old and did not know English when she arrived in the States. The shift from cold-war Germany to 1970s California was a culture shock for Barth. Later, Barth's received her Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of California, Davis in 1982 and a Master of Fine Arts from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1985. From 1990 to 2008, she was a professor in the Art Department at the University of California, Riverside, until she was given the honorary title of Professor Emeritus in the Department of Art in 2008 to the present. She was also a visiting Graduate Faculty member at the Art Center College of Design, Pasadena, California from 2000 to 2012 and has been a visiting professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. After receiving the MacArthur Fellowship in October 2012, she noted that she still plans to teach on a part-time basis because teaching forces her to \\"put language to\\" what she is thinking.  Work  Early work: late 1980s & early 1990s In 1989 Barth's work was black and white, multi-paneled photographic and painted images mounted on wood that addressed the psychodynamics of vision, using optic patterns, repetitious visual metaphors for the eye, and diagrams related to light and human vision. The multi-panel work set up formal relationships that would continue through Barth's artistic practice in later works. Barth explains that this early work was about ‚Äúthe confrontation with the camera, in the feeling of being looked at, blasted with light, being blinded, all as a physical experience.‚Äù In 1990, Barth continued to explore optic patterns and illusions in her works Untitled #11‚Äì14. This work includes four small photographs of houses that are encompassed in large fields of black and white strips, similar to that of static on a television screen and creates an optic vibration. The work intersects with the themes of photographic vision and the idea of the ‚Äògaze.‚Äô  Mid 1990s Barth's work began to internalize the space between the viewer and the object in the mid 1990s, zooming in and zooming out, looking close and far away in her works like Untitled #13 (1991) and Untitled #16 (1990). She begins playing with the communication of space with in the work through landscape and abstracted text, and plays with the idea of how the perception of the works occurs within the human body viewing it. Pamela Lee says, ‚Äúthe self-consciousness of looking is grounded in subjective looking‚Äù in Barth's work. In Untitled #13, Barth includes a photograph of a landscape whose details are blurred to slow down the immediate understanding of the image by the audience. This effect describes the instability of one's visual field of vision, and becomes the basis for Barth's next series of works Grounds.  Grounds (1992‚Äì1995)  This body of photographs consists of over 50 images in different sizes and scales. These photos defy the conventional flat photographic image by being laminated prints that are then mounted on wood boards multiple inches thick, projecting the print away from the wall. As a result, the images of Grounds impersonate an object instead of a print. This plays into Barth's conceptual ideas for the body of work, referring to these photographs as ‚Äúcontainers of information.\\" Writer Darren Campion says,\\"Barth's work addresses that fundamental dissonance between the world as it is and the world as we see it, the chasms of perceived experience. This is extended to other areas of the photographic process as well ‚Äì the main correlate of space being, of course, time, and its fluidity, which seems antithetical to our notion of what photography does.\\" Barth made the images by photographing generic locations outdoors as if she was shooting a formal portrait but removed the subject of the portrait in focus and left the out-of- focus background behind. Barth's gesture reverses the typical use of the camera, shooting something out of focus instead of something in-focus. As a result, she photographs unoccupied space. Barth was thinking about stock photography while making this body of work, picturing backdrops for family photos and portrait photography from the 1960s and 1970s.  Fields (1995‚Äì1996)  In 1995 Barth began transitioning from her Grounds series into a new body of work known as Fields. She took her photographic approach in Grounds and turned it on its side, thinking about the site- specific relationship between the photograph and the physical space where it was made. This idea introduces motion into the work. Visual movement across the images in Fields creates a blur that is similar to that found in film and cinematic work. Fields produces the \\"illusion of filmic space and time\\" and Barth has said that she created this body of work in a similar way film producers scout locations for the perfect place to shoot a scene in a film. In relation to her Field and Ground series, which depict blurred and empty foregrounds, Barth has stated: \\"I am interested in the conventions of picture- making, in the desire to picture the world and in our relationship, our continual love for and fascination with pictures.\\"  Late 1990s In 1998 Barth begins another series of Untitled works, including Untitled (98.4) and Untitled (98.6). Here, Barth begins to focus on sequencing in the gallery again, grouping images together in diptychs, triptychs and clusters. The work plays on the idea of multiple points of view or the experience of a visual double-take where a detail catches the viewer long enough to take a second image, a second look. To make this work, Barth would shoot multiple photographs in a row so that she could go back and edit the series of images to find the best photographs to pair together. This act re-introduces the notion of time into Barth's work. She begins spacing her panels of images on the wall in intervals to show gaps in time between shooting the photographs.  Early 2000s Barth creates two of her most famous bodies of work during the same time period, nowhere near (1999) and ‚Ä¶and of time (2000). Here, Barth interrogates the temporality of photography and the duration of vision. In nowhere near the camera records a repeated view out of Barth's living room window over multiple months. She made hundreds of images that contain moments of framing, records the ebb and flow of light and captures the change of the seasons. This body of work deals with the duration of looking and the prolonged engagement with \\"seeing\\" nothing. The series of work ‚Ä¶and of time is the inverse series about the same window found in nowhere near. The images depict the light falling through the window, repeating grid like reflections of light that bounce and illuminate onto the wall and floor of Barth's living room. \\"The window becomes the aperture of the house and light and imagery project through it,\\" Barth's says. In 2002 Barth creates white blind (bright red). She deliberately sequences images, pairing anywhere from two, six or a dozen photographs of bare tree branches with white sky backdrops together. In contrast with the photographic panels are brightly colored panels of primary red, ox-blood, and a deep yellow scattered throughout the sequencing that break up the visual rhythm of movement from one image to the next. Instead of being drawn in by a single image, the viewer experiences a banned of images that flicker across the walls of the gallery in a horizon line of images. \\"A flickering of visual consciousness,\\" Holly Meyers, an art critic for the Los Angeles Times wrote in reference to the work. Optical illusion occurs, as the viewer walks through the sequencing of tree branches and interrupting red and yellow color panels interspersed throughout the photographic imagery, creating afterimages that strike the viewers eyes.  ...and to draw a bright white line with light (2011)  This series of work was commissioned by the Art Institute of Chicago in 2011 and marks a turn in Barth's work. In this series, Barth's intervention of her own body parts into the photographic frame to position the subject of the photograph is made visible. The viewer can identify Barth's arm or arm's shadow, as she creates the lines of light the camera captures in the series of photographs. This more recent work embodies Barth's idea of her own personal intervention into the space that she photographs. In previous series she aimed to spark observation and a sense of visual perception in the work. \\"Perhaps I have just discovered a way to make marks with light that fits into my ongoing practice,\\" Barth's explains about the series in an interview with Art in American. This interview was in conjunction with a show Barth's had on view at gallery 1301PE in Los Angeles in October 2011. ‚Ä¶and to draw a bright white line with light was shown at Art Institute of Chicago May 14 ‚Äì August 16, 2011, as well as, Tanya Bonakdar in New York in October 2011.  Collaborations The Getty Museum commissioned eleven Los Angeles Artists for a collaborative exhibition titled Departures: 11 Artists at the Getty and Uta Barth was invited to participate. The exhibition was open to the public from February 29, 2000 through May 7, 2000. Each artist was commissioned to create works in response to art in the Getty's collection. Exhibition curator Lisa Lyons said, \\"Departures is intended to explore the potent and sometimes surprising ways in which the art of the past can inform contemporary art. Equally important, the new works produced for the exhibition will offer valuable insights into the Getty collections.\\" The press release for the show gave a brief description of the each artists goals for their work, including Barth who planned to create a series of multi-panel photographs capturing variations of a single view of the interior of her home. These images where inspired by two artists represented at the Getty: the Impressionist painter Claude Monet (Wheatstacks, Snow Effect Morning, 1891) and environmental artist Robert Irwin (Central Garden, 1997).  Group shows Uta Barth has also participated in multiple group shows nationally and international. One group show she participated in was held at the Getty Museum in 2013. The titled of the exhibition was \\"At the Window: A Photographer‚Äôs View‚Äù and also included Gregory Crewdson and Yuki Onodera. Barth showed work from ‚Äònowhere near‚Äô and ‚Äò‚Ä¶and of time.‚Äô This show articulates a theme and motif throughout Barth's work: the window. In an interview with the artists in the show, Barth's says, ‚ÄúThe window is a wonderful vehicle for referring to the act of looking.‚Äù The exhibition displayed the contemporary artists work alongside art historical works like French inventor Joseph Nic√©phore Ni√©pce who took the world's first photograph in 1826. Select exhibitions and collections Her work has been featured in many exhibitions nationally and internationally, including Museum of Modern Art, New York; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, Art Institute of Chicago; Henry Art Gallery, University of Washington, Seattle; the SCAD Museum of Art, Savannah; SITE, Santa Fe; Contemporary Arts Museum, Houston; Lannan Foundation, Santa Fe; and Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles and Museum of Modern Art, Istanbul.

Behring Center collects, preserves, and displays the heritage of the United States in the areas of social, political, cultural, scientific, and military history. Among the items on display is the original Star-Spangled Banner. The museum is part of the Smithsonian Institution and located on the National Mall at 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW in Washington, D.C. History The museum opened in 1964 as the Museum of History and Technology. It was one of the last structures designed by the renowned architectural firm McKim Mead & White. In 1980, the museum was renamed the National Museum of American History to represent its mission of the collection, care, study, and interpretation of objects that reflect the experience of the American people. In May 2012, John Gray became the new director. He retired from the post in May 2018 and was succeeded by Anthea M. Hartig who was previously chief executive of the California Historical Society. Renovations The south facade of the museum The museum underwent an $85 million renovation from September 5, 2006 to November 21, 2008, during which time it was closed. Skidmore, Owings and Merrill provided the architecture and interior design services for the renovation, led by Gary Haney. Major changes made during the renovation include: * A new, five-story sky-lit atrium, which is surrounded by displays of artifacts that showcase the breadth of the museum's collection. * A new, grand staircase that links the museum's first and second floors. * A new welcome center, and the addition of six landmark objects to orient visitors. * New galleries, such as the Jerome and Dorothy Lemelson Hall of Invention. * An environmentally controlled chamber to protect the original Star-Spangled Banner flag. In 2012, the museum began a $37 million renovation of the west wing to add new exhibition spaces, public plazas and an education center. The renovation will also include panoramic windows overlooking the National Mall on all three floors and new interactive features to the exhibits. The first floor of the west wing reopened on July 1, 2015 with the second and third floors of the west wing reopening in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Layout North facade entrance of the museum Each wing of the museum's three exhibition floors is anchored by a landmark object to highlight the theme of that wing. These include the John Bull locomotive, the Greensboro, North Carolina lunch counter, and a one of a kind draft wheel. Landmarks from pre-existing exhibits include the 1865 Vassar Telescope, a George Washington Statue, a Red Cross ambulance, and a car from Disneyland's Dumbo Flying Elephant ride. Artifact walls, of glass-fronted cases, line the first and second floor center core. The artifact walls are organized around themes including arts; popular culture; business, work and economy; home and family; community; land and natural resources; peopling America; politics and reform; science; medicine; technology; and the United States' role in the world. Building =Lower level= The lower level of the museum displays Taking America to Lunch, which celebrates the history of American lunch boxes. The museum's food court, the Stars and Stripes Caf√©, and ride simulators are also located here. =First floor= John Bull, an 1831 locomotive displayed in America on the Move, a first-floor exhibit The first floor's East Wing (called 1 East) has exhibits that feature transportation and technology; they include America on the Move and Lighting a Revolution. The John Bull locomotive is the signature artifact. The exhibits in the West Wing (1 West) address science and innovation. They include Science in American Life featuring Robots on the Road and Bon App√©tit! Julia Child's Kitchen. Spark!Lab is a hands-on exhibit of the Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation. The Vassar Telescope is the signature artifact. A caf√© and the main museum store are also located on the first floor. The first floor also contains the Constitution Avenue lobby (1 Center), as well as a space for a temporary exhibit. =Second floor= George Washington, 1840, by Horatio Greenough The exhibitions in 2 East, the east wing of the second floor, consider American ideals and include the Albert Small Documents Gallery featuring rotating exhibits. From November 21, 2008 through January 4, 2009 an original copy of the Gettysburg Address, on loan from the White House, was on display. The Greensboro lunch counter is the signature artifact for this section of the museum. Located in the center of the second floor (2 Center) is the original Star Spangled Banner Flag which inspired Francis Scott Key's poem. The newly conserved flag, the centerpiece of the renovated museum, is displayed in a climate-controlled room at the heart of the museum. An interactive display by Potion Design, just across the room from the flag, features a full-size, digital reproduction of the flag that allows patrons to learn more about it by touching different areas on the flag. The George Washington statue, sculpted by Horatio Greenough for exhibit in the Rotunda of the United States Capitol and in celebration of the centennial of Washington's birth, is the signature artifact for 2 West, the west wing of the second floor of the museum. The second floor also houses the museum's new welcome center and a store. The second floor lobby leads out to Madison Drive and the National Mall. =Third floor= Philadelphia Exhibits in the east wing of the third floor, 3 East, are focused on the military history of the United States; they include The Price of Freedom: Americans at War and The Gunboat Philadelphia. The center of the third floor, 3 Center, presents The American Presidency: A Glorious Burden, which explores the personal and public lives of the men who have held that office. It also features the popular permanent exhibit of First Ladies of America, which features their contributions and changing roles, and displays their dresses as a mark of changing times. The third-floor west wing, 3 West, has exhibits that feature entertainment, sports, and music. These include Thanks for the Memories: Music, Sports and Entertainment History, the Hall of Musical Instruments, and The Dolls' House. A car from Disneyland's Dumbo the Flying Elephant ride is the signature artifact. Outdoor sculptures In 1967, the abstract sculpture, Infinity, was dedicated at the National Mall entrance. Designed by Jos√© de Rivera and created by Roy Gussow, it was one of the first abstract sculptures displayed at a major public building in Washington D.C. The sculpture is a , polished stainless steel ribbon on top of a granite tower. Alexander Calder's sculpture, Gwenfritz, was installed in a fountain on the west side. The steel abstract stabile was dedicated to the museum on June 2, 1969. In 1984, the museum moved the work to a site closer to Constitution Avenue until July 2013, when conservators removed it for restoration. The sculpture returned to its original site in November 2014, and sits in the midst of a re-created reflecting pool. Calder's original plan for the sculpture envisioned it surrounded by water jets, but architects and engineers of the site determined that the fountain would be challenging to maintain and the water spray would hasten deterioration of the metal. Archives In support of the museum's mission, the Archives Center identifies, acquires, and preserves significant archival records in many media and formats to document America's history and its diverse cultures. Center staff arrange, describe, preserve, and make collections accessible in support of scholarship, exhibitions, publications, and education. The Archives Center occupies over of shelving in the National Museum of American History building. Subject strengths include the history of the radio, television, the telegraph, computing, and other aspects of the history of technology with a special interest in the history of invention; advertising, marketing, and entrepreneurship; commercial visual ephemera (postcards, greeting cards); American music (sheet music, jazz) and musical instruments. These, and a wide range of other subjects, are documented in business records, personal papers, and extensive holdings of motion picture film, video and sound recordings, historical photographs, and oral histories. Jerome and Dorothy Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation The Lemelson Center, an initiative of the Lemelson Foundation, produces educational programs, popular and academic publications, exhibitions, podcasts and symposia about invention. The mission of the Lemelson Center is to document, interpret and disseminate information about invention and innovation, encourage creativity in young people, and foster an appreciation for the central role of innovation in the history of the United States. The Center frequently provides a multi-year focus on some aspect of how invention has influenced American society, such as its 2002 \\"'Invention and the Environment\\" theme. Programs include an annual symposium, presentations and guest speakers, and often the publication of a book highlighting a particular topic. The Center provides free curricular material to classrooms throughout the United States, organizes traveling museum exhibitions (such as Invention at Play), and provides research opportunities. It obtains archival collections related to invention for the museum's Archives Center. Such collections consist of the papers and materials that document the work of past and current American inventors. Directors The following individuals have served as the director of the NMAH.

The franchise was created by Kevin Gillis with the co-operation of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (French: Soci√©t√© Radio- Canada). Synopsis The series revolves around Bert Raccoon and married couple Ralph and Melissa Raccoon, of whom Bert is a friend and roommate. The series mostly involved the trio's efforts against the industrialist forces of greedy aardvark millionaire Cyril Sneer, who usually tries to destroy the forest for a quick buck. However, the Raccoons would always save their forest from Cyril's schemes, with help from their forest friends including Schaeffer, a gentle Old English Sheepdog; Cedric, Cyril's college graduate son; and Sophia Tutu, Cedric's girlfriend. As the series progressed, Cyril becomes more of a sympathetic character, eventually becoming an antihero, becoming more responsible in his priorities and business practices. Originally, the story was set in a kind of hidden world in the Evergreen Forest where a small human family of a Forest Ranger and his children reside unaware of the struggles taking place out of sight. However, the second season had these human characters removed as the premise shifted to an unambiguous fantasy world of a sophisticated humanoid animal version of Canada with complex transportation systems, broadcasting media and heavy industry etc.. In addition, Ralph's relatives become regular characters, especially his young nephew and niece, Bentley the insecure child technology prodigy and Lisa the statuesque athletic teenager who became an understated love interest for Bert. Unlike many other cartoons of its time, it handled action, humor, and romance in a fairly sophisticated manner, while remaining sufficiently uncomplicated for younger viewers. Lessons featured in the series mainly included environmentalism, but also included other lessons, including friendship and teamwork. Episodes Characters Main * Bert Raccoon (voiced by Len Carlson) The main hero of the series. He is Ralph and Melissa's houseguest and is their best friend from childhood.

The initial idea for the show was created by Gillis and columnist Gary Dunford. They drew their inspiration for Ralph Raccoon from a dilemma that happened at a cottage in Ottawa. Dunford backed out, but Gillis took his idea to Ottawa lawyer Sheldon S. Wiseman, who saw a potential in Gillis' idea and put together a large group ‚Äì animators, musicians, and writers, to create the first special to star the characters known as The Christmas Raccoons. Production on the special began in 1979 and was completed in 1980, and the special was shown on the December of the same year on CBC Television. It was also shown in countries around the world, including the United States and the United Kingdom. The special was a huge hit and resulted in two sequel specials The Raccoons on Ice and The Raccoons and the Lost Star and a direct-to-video special, The Raccoons: Let's Dance! In 1981, United States TV networks CBS, NBC and ABC approached Sheldon Wiseman about producing a 13 episode Raccoons TV series. In 1984, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the Disney Channel began funding on the television series, which cost about $4.5 million to make. In the United States, the show was run on The Disney Channel from July 4, 1985, to August 28, 1992.The Disney Channel Magazine, Vol. 10, no. 4, August/September 1992: p. 36, 52. In Canada, it was shown on CBC on Monday evenings for the first season and was shown in a block consisting of The Wonderful World of Disney and Fraggle Rock on Sundays for the next two seasons before moving to Wednesdays in its fourth, sharing an hour block with The Beachcombers and then finally Tuesdays in its fifth and final season. Music The series had a new wave soundtrack including the theme song \\"Run with Us\\" by cast member Lisa Lougheed. Season 1 ended with a different version of the song, not sung by Lougheed. \\"Run with Us\\" was performed in Season 1 by Stephen Lunt. In the first season, the French Canadian singer Luba performed several songs, several of which were later re-recorded by Lougheed for use in other seasons. There were also several other songs performed by other musicians such as Rita Coolidge and Rupert Holmes who performed songs for the first special, Leo Sayer and Coolidge again for the second, and John Schneider and Dottie West for the last television special. Three of the songs had replaced Schneider's vocals with Frank Floyd and Hank Martin. Rory Dodd, The Dior Bros. (actually Kevin Gillis and Jon Stroll under a pseudonym), and several other musicians also had songs performed, although somewhat rarely compared to the aforementioned people. According to Jon Stroll, Frank Floyd, the frontman of the 1970s R&B; funk group The Writers, was originally selected to be the main male singer for the series. Instead, as backup singer Valerie Wilson suggested, they replaced Floyd at the last minute with Curtis King Jr. The earlier version of \\"Run with Us\\", like quite a few of the other songs from The Raccoons, were never officially released. The songs from the first two specials were released on the album Lake Freeze ‚Äì The Raccoons Songtrack in 1983. A soundtrack for the fourth special was released in 1984, but featured vocals from Frank Floyd and Hank Martin to replace John Schneider. Nine of the songs from the series featured on Lougheed's album Evergreen Nights (1987), though Lougheed only sang some of the songs (sometimes in duets), while some were sung by other artists (Curtis King Jr. and Stephen Lunt). The French version of \\"Run with Us\\", as well as most of Luba and Lisa Lougheed's songs, was performed by the French Canadian singer Jano Bergeron with \\"Run with Us\\" being renamed in French to \\"Viens Vers Nous\\". The instrumental music was composed by Kevin Gillis and Jon Stroll and performed largely by the National Arts Centre Orchestra from Ottawa, Canada. Most of the instrumental cues heard in the series were actually recorded for The Raccoons and the Lost Star and re-used. Only six of the instrumental tunes (two from The Raccoons on Ice and four from The Raccoons and the Lost Star) have ever been released officially (they can be found on the Lake Freeze and Let's Dance! albums). Animation From 1979 to 1985, Canadian animation company Atkinson Film- Arts provided the animation for the four specials and first season of the series.All episodes in season 1 say in the end credits \\"Animation Facility: Atkinson Film-Arts\\" In 1986, after producing the first 11 episodes, Hinton Animation Studios took over to animate the remaining seasons of the show (seasons 2‚Äì5).All episodes in season 2‚Äì5 say in the end credits \\"Produced at Hinton Animation Studios Inc.\\" Home media Embassy Pictures and its home video counterpart were responsible for releasing the specials and Season 1 on home video from 1982 to 1987. Embassy also released the specials on Laserdisc, CED and Betamax formats. Other distributors, such as Catalyst & GoodTimes released some specials and episodes on VHS. In the UK, Embassy Home Entertainment released the four Raccoons specials on VHS in the mid-1980s, before the distribution rights went to Channel 5 Video (a division of Polygram Video) in 1986. They re-released the four specials on video, as well as released another video called The Raccoons Big Surprise with two Season 1 episodes \\"Surprise Attack\\" and \\"Going It Alone\\" (Cat. No. CFV 05042). Then three videos with Season 2 episodes were released, the first two were by Picture Music International (PMI) that included \\"Double Play\\" and \\"The Sweet Smell of Success\\" on volume 1, released in 1988 and then \\"Blast from the Past\\" and \\"Power Trip\\" on volume 2, released in 1989. Then Video Collection International Ltd released a third tape which contained the episodes \\"Stop The Clock\\" and \\"The Artful Dodger\\" on 13 August 1990 (Cat No. VC1191). That same tape was re-released again by Video Collection International Ltd on 22 July 1991, as part of their Children's Club range (Cat No. KK0019). In 2003, Morningstar Entertainment released the show on DVD for the first time. Two 9-episode boxsets were released, each containing 3 discs that were also available separately. The discs were released without any region coding in NTSC format. The first set contained nine of the ten episodes from season 2 (omitting \\"Stop the Clock\\") and the second set contained the first nine episodes of season 3. The extras include character bios, a chance to create your own scene from The Raccoons and Raccoon-A-Roma DVD-ROM content, like QuickTime animated sequences. For this release, Len Carlson also reprised his role as Bert during menus and gave in-character commentary before and after episodes. Both sets are now out of print, and no North American DVD release has come out since then. A 2-disc Region 2 PAL DVD release of the complete series 1 was released on September 17, 2007 through Fabulous Films Ltd. The bonus features on set 1 were duplicated from the Canadian release, mainly the create a scene and Raccoon-A-Roma DVD ROM content. They later released a DVD entitled \\"Three Adventures With The Raccoons\\" on April 7, 2008. This DVD contained the first 3 episodes of Series 1 with no extras. Series 2 was released on April 20, 2009 by Fabulous Films Ltd. in another 2-disc set. DVD extras on the set include character model sheets and a documentary. On September 18, 2009, MORE Entertainment released an 8-disc DVD set in Germany, it contained all 60 episodes (7‚Äì8 per disc) and no extras. The language track is German only.

In 1990, Bert and Lisa were named the mascots of the Canadian Olympic team. There were no Olympic Games that year. Reboot On July 4, 2017, it was revealed that series creator Kevin Gillis was working on a reboot of the series. A pitch pilot with slightly redesigned characters was found on YouTube as an unlisted video on March 11, 2018, however the video was soon taken down by Big Jump Entertainment due to a copyright claim. On June 17 of that same year, Big Jump officially revealed the new designs for Bert, Ralph, Melissa, Cyril and Cedric on their website. The reboot is scheduled to premiere in 2020, beginning with a holiday special entitled \\"When Raccoons Fly!\\".

The animated Rainbow Brite television series first aired in 1984, the same year Hallmark licensed Rainbow Brite to Mattel for a range of dolls and other merchandise. A theatrical feature-length film, Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer, was released by Warner Bros. in 1985. The franchise was rebooted in 2014 with a three part mini-series released on Hallmark's online streaming video service, Feeln. A line of new merchandise by Hallmark online and in its shops debuted in 2015. Production Creation and development of Rainbow Brite for Hallmark Cards is credited to both Hallmark's Vice President of Creative/Licensing, Garry Glissmeyer, a team of artists headed by Cheryl Cozad, and writers under the direction of Hallmark's Editorial Director, Dan Drake. Hallmark's Vice President of Sales and Marketing, Lanny Julian, assembled a team of legal, marketing, and public relations associates for this new licensing division. Glissmeyer and Julian were tasked with breaking Hallmark into the licensing business with the creation of characters targeted at children. Glissmeyer's group's concept of a young girl with powers over nature evolved into her being responsible for all of the colors of the universe. Once the concept was agreed to, Cozad's and Drake's teams developed the backstory and characters needed to support it. Jim McDowell, a key player from Hallmark's marketing unit, conceptualized a strategy to get the new brand in the public eye. Julian chose Mattel as the manufacturer and distributor for the line of dolls and toys to follow. Julian chose DIC Entertainment of France as the studio to provide the brand with episodic animation for television. Glissmeyer placed Cozad in charge of the in-house creative group, to work with Mattel and other licensees. Glissmeyer and Drake continued with creative input, working with DIC on the animation development. While Hallmark artist, G.G. Santiago, developed the final \\"look\\" of Rainbow Brite, Cozad's team finalized style guide models for Rainbow Brite and her friends. Hallmark writer, Mary Loberg, and freelance television writer, Woody Kling, worked with DIC in creating TV storylines for the series, which provided DIC the framework to produce the animation episodes. Kling only worked on three episodes and did not create the Rainbow Brite character or brand as some people believe. Rainbow Brite made her animated debut in the syndicated prime-time television special, \\"Peril in the Pits,\\" which was first aired on June 27, 1984. Later, a pair of two-part specials were produced: \\"The Mighty Monstromurk Menace\\" and \\"The Beginning of Rainbowland.\\" A theatrical feature-length film, Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer, was released by Warner Bros. in 1985. The specials became part of DIC's weekly syndicated Kideo TV block of programming starting in April 1986, which were followed up with eight more episodes for a total of thirteen, which is one season in American television, and were rerun until the end of March 1987, after which the show was replaced on the Kideo TV schedule by Lady Lovely Locks & the Pixietails. All were published on VHS videotapes in the United States and other countries, along with two live-action programs. One of these was a program intended for use at kids' birthday parties (\\"It's Your Birthday Party\\"); the other was made on location at the San Diego Zoo (\\"San Diego Zoo Adventure\\"). Hallmark also created a Rainbow Brite Style Book for companies that wanted to make Rainbow Brite items under license. It gave detailed drawings of all the players and Hallmark's policies on a number of subjects such as the use of its Rainbow Brite logos on the packaging for each product, copyright notices on all products where feasible, fees for creating artwork and the approvals needed before production of new Rainbow Brite merchandise could start. Premise In Gen 1 continuity, and most of the franchise's backstory, a young girl named Wisp is brought to a gray, desolate land with the mission to bring color to this fictional world by locating the Sphere of Light. Along the way, she befriends a furry creature (called a sprite) named Twink and a magnificent horse named Starlite and finds a mysterious baby who turns out to be the key to her mission. With the help of her new friends, Wisp locates the legendary Color Belt and rescues the seven Color Kids, who had been trapped by the King of Shadows. Using the Color Belt, Wisp and the Sphere of Light defeat the King of Shadows, liberate the sprites, and bring color and beauty to the land, henceforth called Rainbow Land. Wisp is renamed Rainbow Brite in honor of her new role as leader of the Color Kids, who are together in charge of all the colors in the universe. The Color Kids spread color across the universe from the Color Console inside the Color Castle. Each Color Kid is in charge of their respective color, has a personal sprite and manages a number of like-colored sprites that mine Color Crystals from the nearby Color Caves. These crystals are processed into Star Sprinkles which are the essential components to brightening and coloring any object or place. Rainbow Brite and the Color Kids' mission is often complicated by the likes of Murky Dismal, his sidekick Lurky, and other villains. Brian, a boy from Earth, sometimes assisted Rainbow Brite in her adventures. In the movie, Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer, the setting expands to include the diamond planet, Spectra. All the light in the universe must pass through Spectra before coming to Earth. However, Earth soon falls into a wintry darkness when the diamond- obsessed Dark Princess decides to steal Spectra for her own. Rainbow Brite and her horse, Starlite, must team with Spectra's boy warrior, Krys, and his robotic horse, On-X, to defeat the powers of darkness and save Spectra, Earth, and the universe. Gen 2 continuity took a radical departure from any other generation's story, focusing as much on ethnic diversity as the colors of the rainbow. Rainbow Brite had an entirely new and smaller group of friends called the Color Crew. Despite distribution and marketing in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia, the toy line never reached the success of its predecessor and ended after little more than a year. Gen 3 was basically a relaunch of Gen 1 in 2003, with the same story, but a smaller range of characters produced. The dolls from Toy Play were similar to but not exact copies of the Gen 1 versions. There was also a sizable amount of Rainbow Brite merchandise from various other manufacturers just as in Gen 1. Gen 4A celebrated the 25th Anniversary of Rainbow Brite in 2009 with continuity returning the setting again to Rainbow Land, which looked nothing like the original version. This time, Rainbow Brite and her friends' mission was to bring hope and happiness to the far corners of the universe, making hearts lighter and worlds a little more colorful along the way. The story focuses on Rainbow Brite, Tickled Pink, and Moonglow, each representing one of Rainbow Land's Sky Powers, which determine the cycles of the days and seasons. Gen 4 continuity makes Rainbow Brite a girl originally from Earth (Return to Rainbow Land). Rainbow Brite's absence from the world is explained in a story that sees Rainbow return to her home on Earth for a brief visit with her family after many adventures spreading color throughout Rainbow Land and the universe. But when the Dark Princess erases Rainbow Land from Rainbow Brite's memory while on Earth, she never returns to her duties in Rainbow Land. Rainbow Brite eventually returns to Rainbow Land with the help of Starlite and Puppy Brite. These dolls had a more mature fashion doll-like design, which was totally unlike all of the previous dolls in the series. The three girl dolls were wearing training bras and panties under their clothes. The line suffered a delay, which caused the toys to not be available until after the holiday season that year. It saw scarce distribution as retailers were not impressed with it and was canceled after just seven months and before the first release was completed. Feeln's (part of Hallmark) Gen 4B animated reboot retained most Gen 1 story elements and recognizable but not identical character designs. It introduced a few new story elements, one being the Sentinels of Light, which included Rainbow Brite as a guardian of light and color and Krys as the protector of light unseen. Stormy also played a more prominent role. After a falling out with her pal, Rainbow Brite, Stormy joined the forces of darkness and became a formidable frenemy. As the Dark Princess's manipulations became more transparent, Stormy started questioning where her true loyalties lay and returned to Rainbow Land as Rainbow Brite's friend. Gen 4B consisted solely of web content from Hallmark and only resulted in a minuscule amount of give-away merchandise. None of the items were available for purchase. Gen 5 began in 2015 with dolls and toys very similar to those of Gens 1 and 3. Hallmark worked on the design, storylines, distribution and sales which have, so far, been limited to Hallmark shops in the United States and Canada, and the Hallmark website. The line began with a limited production of Hallmark's Itty Bittys plush miniatures before expanding to larger Twink & Starlite plushes, a 16\\" Rainbow Brite doll, a series of hard cover story books, women's clothing, and an expansion of the Itty Bittys line. In the fall of 2016, Hallmark released a Stormy doll with her own horse. Merchandise First Generation: Mattel For the first Rainbow Brite generation (1984‚Äì1987), Mattel produced the dolls and many of the toys along with a large line of school supplies only sold in Italy. Other Rainbow Brite licensed merchandise was produced by various companies. This included many story and activity books by Western Publishing (Little Golden Books), a number of puzzles, a line of costume jewelry, banks and suitcases by Kat's Meow, clothes, toys, games, doll and child furniture, radios, child cosmetics, linen, towels, personal care items, lamps, figurines, VHS videocassettes, audio cassettes, records, bicycles, bedding, curtains and much more sold in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. The rest of Europe saw a smaller variety of merchandise, though this varied from country to country. For example, the entire Mattel line was not sold in all countries. Italy and Spain did not receive the second release of dolls (Lala Orange, Buddy Blue and Shy Violet), the Dress Up line or Kitty Brite. Many Mattel items were made in Europe by local suppliers for the local markets. A French toymaker produced Rainbow Brite, Murky Dismal and Lurky in Mattel packaging in France during 1984 and 1985. An Italian toy company made the European versions of Starlite, the Color Cottage, and the Color Buggy for all of Europe during 1984 and 1985. In both cases, production was switched to Mattel's contract manufacturers in Asia for 1986 and 1987. The entire line of Rainbow Brite for Spain (six dolls, five sprites, Starlite, Lurky and the Color Cottage) was produced in Spain from 1984 until the line ended there in 1986 or 1987. Similarly, this occurred in Mexico with the entire doll line minus the Dress Up dolls. This was the result of high import duties in a number of countries at the time, caused by protectionist policies. Books, comic books, sticker albums and audio tapes were the best selling licensed items outside the United Kingdom, but other items did exist in different countries. In Germany alone there were no less than thirty-one story cassettes and forty-six comic books. Germany also had an exclusive version of the Dress Up Rainbow Brite doll that included a story cassette. This cassette was not sold separately but was produced by Europa, producer of the other 30 story cassettes. It is unknown if the cassettes were sent to the Asian factory that made the dolls or were put into the dolls' boxes in Germany. A line of five 3D erasers in the form of various Rainbow Brite characters was sold in Europe with Mattel branding, while the same line was also sold in Australia under the name of Harveston Super Action figures with the addition of an additional character (Lurky) not sold in Europe. A number of Gen 1B (the second release of the first generation) dolls made for the American and Mexican markets ended up being sold in Germany because of strong demand there. These dolls had their English or Spanish names covered by a sticker with the German name or sometimes nothing at all. Two Rainbow Brite dolls plus Twink and Starlite were also produced in Brazil by Estrella. These were not exported anywhere and came in their own unique white packaging with all writing less the Rainbow Brite name in the Brazilian version of Portuguese. Because of Rainbow Brite's extreme popularity soon after she was launched, a number of other companies not related to Mattel produced many unlicensed lookalike (fake or bootleg) items that were sold in North America and Europe. The Mattel line of toys and dolls was quite large. There were three large dolls, five medium dolls (Emotions) 12 small dolls, nine animals, 50 sprites (including those that came with the small dolls), four large boxed toys, ten boxed wallhangings and doll carriers, and 27 small carded toys for a total of 111 different items and this does not include generational (some dolls were sold in two different boxes over time in some markets) and international packaging variations. These toys were expensive for their time and Mattel responded by producing a lower priced line of toys sold loose with tags called the 'Emotions' line. The Emotions line included five dolls including a 15\\" Buddy Blue doll that was sold only in Canada. The extra sprite in the line happened to be Champ. Also included were five Sprites, Starlite the horse and Lurky. Oddly enough, the Emotions dolls were larger than the small dolls in the regular line, but the Emotions horse was smaller than the normal version. As such the Emotions dolls were neither in scale with the Emotions horse or the regular Mattel version. And of course the Emotions dolls were too big to sit on the Emotions horse or the normal one. Not all toys were sold in all markets, and the Emotions line was never sold outside the United States and Canada. Mattel's Dress Up line of dolls and horses is the most sought after part of the entire Mattel line, particularly Moonglow who was only sold in Germany. Although Stormy's doll was shown in the Mattel catalog and on the backs of the Dress Up doll boxes, she was never produced for retail even though the character did appear in some cartoon episodes and several German comic books. There was also a line of cataloged clothing for the Dress Up dolls, but like Stormy, it was never produced. The two horses, Starlight and Sunriser, were made from hard plastic rather than being stuffed. They were in fact from Mattel's line of 'Barbie' merchandise. The Dress Up line was only made for about one year. That makes the two horses and Moonglow very difficult to find today, especially MIB. The Tickled Pink and Rainbow Brite Dress Up dolls are somewhat difficult to find these days compared to the rest of the Gen 1 line. Televised commercials for Mattel's Rainbow Brite dolls frequently featured the song, \\"Over the Rainbow,\\" from The Wizard of Oz, often with altered lyrics or arrangements. Child actors Tracey Gold, Kellie Martin and Heather O'Rourke, famous for their roles in 1980s television and film, also appeared. Second Generation: Up, Up and Away The second Rainbow Brite generation (1996‚Äì1997) greatly differed from any generation before or since. It used the Rainbow Brite name but not the same characters or backstory. The master license was held by Up, Up and Away, a company which is no longer in business. Rainbow Brite no longer had anything do with making colors and was now in charge of diversity. Although this version did have rainbow-colored hair, the characters resembled real-world children more than their previous animated and doll counterparts. In the second generation's story, Rainbow Brite had four friends, called the Color Crew, which included Amber (Latina), Cerise (Asian), Ebony (African-American) and Indigo (Middle Eastern, the only character name borrowed from the original Color Kids). Rainbow Brite was produced as large and small dolls while the Color Crew was represented only in the small doll range. The large Rainbow Brite dolls came with three pots of Color-Glo Paint and a brush, while the small dolls included a single pot of Color-Glo Paint and a brush. The large doll was released in two different boxes, the first lacking a window so buyers could not see the doll inside. As the doll was sold with three different wardrobes, buying one was a gamble regarding which look she would have (unless one read the small code box on the bottom of the package indicating the doll's shoe color). The large doll later came in a window box with a simplified single wardrobe. The small dolls came boxed at first and then blister carded on two different types of cards. They are noted for being the only Rainbow Brite dolls ever produced with Dutch text on the packaging. The Canadian importer was Irvine, a company which is currently still in business, and their product packaging was printed in both French and English texts. Ideal Toy Company was the importer for most of Western Europe, though Euro Play imported the line for Germany. The large doll was also distributed in Italy by GiG with only Italian text on the box. There were no other toys or accessories for the second generation dolls other than additional pots of Color-Glo Paint, which were sold in the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia. There was also a version of at least the large doll in a box with Spanish-only text. Another 15\\" Rainbow Brite doll with a Color Glo Bear and paint set was prototyped, as was a black version, which was produced in very small numbers. But only the black version was ever produced and then in very limited numbers. There was a Gen 2B which had simplified packaging and outfits as an effort to keep the line going by cutting costs. The second generation had nowhere near the success the first generation had at retail and was discontinued after less than two years on the market. Third Generation: Toy Play The third Rainbow Brite generation (2003‚Äì2005) was also the 20th Anniversary Release. The master toy licensee was Toy Play, a defunct subsidiary of The Betesh Group. The parent company is still in business. Nick Jr. was the television network that advertised the line. Hot Topic was the lead merchandiser with a unique Rainbow Brite doll not manufactured by Toy Play and many items of women's clothing, accessories and stationary. Without being an exact copy of the originals, this generation returned to the look and feel of the Mattel line even if the product line was much narrower than the first generation. Toy Play followed the first generation's character roll out, producing Rainbow Brite, Red Butler, Canary Yellow and Patty O'Green characters but no more Color Kids followed. Starlite, Puppy Brite and the Sprites were also represented in various merchandise. Characters were produced in different sizes, from three to twenty-eight inches tall across the line which went from PVC plastic figurines to plush dolls. Toy Play produced both retro-style plush dolls with wiring in their limbs to make them poseable along with plastic dolls wearing soft clothing and having articulated arms and legs. Some dolls were sold with a Region 1 DVD in English featuring a single episode of the original cartoon. Some Toy Play products were sold in Canada with English-French packaging. Toy Play's 18 inch talking Rainbow Brite doll notoriously omitted the color green when 'speaking' all of the colors of the rainbow. Toy Play indicated that the missing color would be added for future production runs, but this never happened because the line died out before a corrected version appeared. Toy Play was the first (and so far only) merchandiser to produce a Color Castle playset, the Light Up Musical Castle, which included small articulated figurines of Rainbow Brite, Red Butler, Twink and Puppy Brite. The playset's box showed pictures of forthcoming product (a Rainbow Brite and Friends Sprites' village playset, an in-scale Starlite with brushable mane, as well as figurine 2-packs to include Rainbow Brite and Twink, Red Butler and Romeo, Patty O'Green and Lucky, Canary Yellow and Spark, and Murky Dismal and Lurky) though these were never produced. There was also a wide range of other merchandise, mostly clothing, that was available during Gen 3. Fourth Generation: Playmates Toys The fourth Rainbow Brite generation (2009‚Äì2010) was the 25th anniversary release and was accompanied by a series of web-episodes produced by Animax Entertainment that were available to stream on www.RainbowBrite.com., which no longer exists. The master toy license belonged to Playmates Toys and their line of Rainbow Brite toys was expected to be in stores in the fall of 2009. Production delays saw the line actually debut in stores on December 24 of that year, which of course missed the 2009 holiday shopping season. The line's initial product release only included three plastic fashion dolls (Rainbow Brite, Tickled Pink, and Moonglow) and three plastic horses with rooted manes (Starlite, Sunriser, and Shimmer). A larger 15\\" Rainbow Brite doll was also produced. The line initially omitted the Color Kids altogether in favor of a more sky-power oriented storyline. The packaging art hinted at a possible Stormy doll to come, though yet again she never arrived. The Playmates line never caught on with its target audience. Most retailers refused to carry the line and those that did saw stock run out by July 2010. If any reorders were placed, they were not in quantities that justified continued production. The line was only on the market for about seven months and was not available in all of the Contiguous United States. In the Fall of 2010 three Sprite dolls appeared at retail in Mexico. These included Twinkle (a renamed Twink) for Rainbow Brite, Nite Sprite for Moonglow and Twilite for Tickled Pink. These were already in production when US retailers dropped the line. The fourth generation saw a number of licensed products similar to the third generation, some in the original Gen 1 style and some in the new Gen 4 style. This included mostly clothing and stationary, plus a small bicycle. The final products during the fourth generation came from Madame Alexander, and included a traditional Madame Alexander-style Gen 1 Rainbow Brite doll with Twink, as well as Gen 4-style plush dolls of Rainbow Brite and Tickled Pink. Feeln A three-part animated miniseries was launched on November 6, 2014 by Video On Demand site Feeln. The reboot showcased updated character designs for the cast, and starred Emily Osment as the voice of Rainbow Brite and Molly Ringwald as the voice of Dark Princess. The second episode was shown on November 13, 2014 and the series concluded on November 20, 2014. Fifth Generation: Hallmark Toys Hallmark introduced the fifth generation of Rainbow Brite toys, along with clothing and other merchandise in July 2015. A limited edition line of Rainbow Brite Itty Bittys featuring Rainbow Brite, Twink, Champ, O.J., Lucky and I.Q. arrived first, each produced in limited quantities of 500 units. The demand led to Hallmark reissuing the Itty Bittys with slightly revised designs in much greater numbers along with the first Rainbow Brite Itty Bittys boxed set featuring Red Butler, Romeo, Indigo and Hammy. These items were followed by an 8\\" Twink plush and 11\\" Starlite plush in September 2015, as well as a 16\\" Rainbow Brite doll that November. In 2016 Hallmark released another Itty Bitty boxed set featuring Patty O'Green, Buddy Blue, Lucky & Champ. A 24\\" Rainbow Brite Jumbo Itty Bitty arrived in December. A limited edition Shy Violet Itty Bitty was released as a Hallmark online exclusive that Summer. In Fall of 2016 many new Rainbow Brite items were available at Hallmark stores and online, including several new story and activity books, a new range of greeting cards, and a 1,000 piece Rainbow Land puzzle. A Starlite Itty Bitty was released in November, as well as 11\\" Sunriser and Skydancer plushes, and for the first time ever a 16\\" Stormy doll. Packaging for the single items consists only of attached tags with the product name, Hallmark logo, copyright notice and barcode, while the boxed sets feature Rainbow Land displayable backgrounds. These toys are sold only in the United States and Canada. Additionally, Hallmark Keepsake Rainbow Brite holiday ornaments were sold in 2015 (a reissue of Hallmark's 2013 ornament) and 2016. A Rainbow Brite comic was published by Dynamite Entertainment for five issues from October 2018 to February 2019.

The museum was initially housed in the Smithsonian Institution Building, which is better known today as the Smithsonian Castle. A formal exhibit hall opened in 1858.D'Angelis, p. 35. The growing collection led to the construction of a new building, the National Museum Building (known today as the Arts and Industries Building). Covering a then-enormous , it was built in just 15 months at a cost of $310,000. It opened in March 1881.Evelyn, Dickson, and Ackerman, p. 107.

The regents began considering sites for the new building in March, and by April 12 settled on a site on the north side of B Street NW between 9th and 12th Streets.\\"Site of New National Museum.\\" Washington Post.

May 21, 2007. In November 2007, The Washington Post reported that an interagency group of scientists from the Department of the Interior, NASA, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and National Science Foundation believed that, despite Samper's denial, the museum \\"acted to avoid criticism from congressional appropriators and global-warming skeptics in the Bush administration\\". The changes were discussed as early as mid-August 2005, and Dr. Waleed Abdalati, manager of NASA's Cryospheric Sciences Program, noted at the time that \\"There was some discussion of the political sensitivities of the exhibit.\\" Although the exhibit was due to open in October 2005, the Post reported that Samper ordered a six-month delay to allow for even further changes. The newspaper also reported that it had obtained a memo drafted by Samper shortly after October 15, 2005, in which Samper said the museum should not \\"replicate\\" work by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. A few weeks later, a NOAA climate researcher advised a superior that the delay was due to \\"the debate within the administration and the science community over the existence and cause of global warming\\". During the delay, Samper asked high-level officials in other government agencies and departments to review the script for the exhibit, ordered his museum staff to make additionals changes, and rearranged the sequence of the exhibit panels so that the discussion of climate change was not immediately encountered by museum visitors. Shortly before the exhibit opened in April 2006, officials at NOAA and the United States Department of Commerce expressed to their superiors their opinion that the exhibit had been changed to accommodate political concerns. In an interview with The Washington Post in November 2007, Samper said he felt the exhibit displayed a scientific certainty that did not exist, and expressed his belief that the museum should present evidence on both sides and let the public make up its own mind. Inside the rotunda The controversy became more heated after the press reported that Samper gave permission for the museum to accept a $5 million donation from American Petroleum Institute that would support the museum's soon-to-be-opened Hall of Oceans. Two members of the Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents (which had final say on accepting the donation) questioned whether the donation was a conflict of interest. Before the board could consider the donation, the donor withdrew the offer.Pogrebin, Robin. \\"Gift to Smithsonian Is Rescinded.\\" New York Times. November 17, 2007.

Research and collections The Smithsonian gives an approximate number for artifacts and specimens of 146 million. More specifically, the collections include 30 million insects, 4.5 million plants preserved in the Museum's herbarium, and 7 million fish stored in liquid-filled jars. The museum has over 570,000 catalogued reptiles from around the world. The National Collection of Amphibians and Reptiles has more than tripled from 190,000 specimen records 1970 to over 580,000 specimen records in 2020. Of the 2 million cultural artifacts, 400,000 are photographs housed in the National Anthropological Archives. Through off-site active loan and exchange programs, the museum's collections can be accessed. As a result, 3.5 million specimens are out on loan every year. The rest of the collections not on display are stored in the non-public research areas of the museum and at the Museum Support Center, located in Suitland, MD. Other facilities include a marine science center in Ft. Pierce, Florida and field stations in Belize, Alaska, and Kenya. Research in the museum is divided into seven departments: anthropology, botany, entomology, invertebrate zoology, mineral sciences, paleobiology, vertebrate zoology. One collection of nearly a million specimens of birds, reptiles, and mammals kept at the museum has been maintained by the Biological Survey unit of the U.S. Geological Survey. This division had started in 1885 as an economic ornithology unit of the Agriculture Department. Clarence Birdseye and Clinton Hart Merriam had worked in this organization. As of February 2018, the unit's funding is planned to be cut, and it is not clear what would happen to the collection.Juliet Eilperin. Trump has long vowed to slash government .

The collection includes some of the most famous pieces of gems and minerals including the Hope Diamond and the Star of Asia Sapphire, one of the largest sapphires in the world. There are currently over 15,000 individual gems in the collection, as well as 350,000 minerals and 300,000 samples of rock and ore specimens. Additionally, the Smithsonian's National Gem and Mineral Collection houses approximately 45,000 meteorite speciments, including examples of every known type of meteorite, and is considered to be one of the most comprehensive collections of its kind in the world. The collection is displayed in the Janet Annenberg Hooker Hall of Geology, Gems and Minerals, one of the many galleries in the Museum of Natural History. Some of the most important donors, besides Hooker, are Washington A. Roebling, the man who built the Brooklyn Bridge, who gave 16,000 specimens to the collection; Frederick A. Canfield, who donated 9,000 specimens to the collection; and Dr. Isaac Lea, who donated the basis of the museum's collection of 1312 gems and minerals. Hall of Human Origins Rick Potts, head of Smithsonian Human Origins project The David H. Koch Hall of Human Origins opened on March 17, 2010, marking the museum's 100th anniversary. The hall is named for David H. Koch, who contributed $15 million to the $20.7 million exhibit. The Hall is \\"dedicated to the discovery and understanding of human origins,\\" and occupies of exhibit space. Specimens include 75 replica skulls, an interactive human family tree that follows six million years of evolution, and a Changing the World gallery that focuses on issues surrounding climate change and humans' impact on the world. The Hall's core concept idea is \\"What Does It Mean To Be Human\\", and focuses on milestones of Human Evolution such as Walking Upright, Bigger Brains, and Creating a World of Symbols. Also covered is the Smithsonian's significant research on the geological and climate changes which occurred in East Africa during significant periods of Human Evolution. The exhibit highlights an actual fossil Neanderthal and replicas created by famed paleoartist, John Gurche. The exhibit has been criticized for downplaying the significance of human-caused global warming. The exhibit also provides a complementary web site, which provides diaries and podcasts directly from related fields of research. The Companion Book, What Does It Mean To Be Human was written by Richard (Rick) Potts, the Curator, and Christopher Sloan. The exhibit was designed by Reich + Petch.

The Museum of the Rockies (which did not own the skeleton but was the repository for it) has about a dozen T. rex specimens, including one which is eighty percent complete. Only about six museums in the United States have a T. rex skeleton. The Museum of the Rockies is a Smithsonian affiliate museum, and had long promised to find a T. rex for the Smithsonian to display. Due to the 2013 federal government shutdown, the fossil did not arrive in Washington, D.C. Smithsonian officials said it remained in storage in Montana, and would not arrive at the Smithsonian until late spring 2014. Packed up in 16 crates, the T. rex, named \\"Nation's T. rex\\" by the Smithsonian, traveled from the Museum of the Rockies and arrived at the National Museum of Natural History on April 15, 2014. The T. rex has been displayed in the Rex Room, while specialists performed a conservation assessment and the Smithsonian Digitization Program scanned each bone, to create a 3-D model for research. The Nation's T. rex will be the centerpiece of the new fossil hall, which opened in 2019. Hall of Mammals The Behring Hall of Mammals was designed by Reich + Petch. The mammal specimens are presented as works of modern art within minimal environmentals. Visitors discover mammal's evolutionary adaptions to hugely diverse contexts, and ultimately discover that they too are mammals. The museum has the largest collection of vertebrate specimens in the world, nearly twice the size of the next largest mammal collections, including historically important collections from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Its collection was initiated by C. Hart Merriam and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (later the Department of the Interior), which expanded it in the 1890s-1930s. Insect Zoo The O. Orkin Insect Zoo features live insects and exhibits about insects and entomologists. Different habitats have been created to show the type of insects that live in different environments and how they have adapted to a freshwater pond, house, mangrove swamp, desert, and rain forest. The zoo is sponsored by Orkin, a pest control company. Ocean Hall Ocean Hall The Sant Ocean Hall opened on September 27, 2008, and is the largest renovation of the museum since it opened in 1910. The hall includes 674 marine specimens and models drawn from the over 80 million specimens in the museum's total collection, the largest in the world. The hall is named for the Roger Sant family, who donated $15 million to endow the new hall and other related programs. The collection includes: a coelenterate-long North Atlantic right whale, a aquarium, one female giant squid displayed in the center of the hall and a male displayed off to the side, an adult coelenterate, and a Basilosaurus. The museum also provides the Smithsonian Ocean Portal, a complementary web site which provides regularly updated, original content from the museum's research, collections, and Sant Ocean Hall as well as content provided by more than 20 collaborating organizations, including Archive, Census of Marine Life, Consortium for Ocean Leadership, Encyclopedia of Life, INDUCT, Monterrey Bay Aquarium, Monterrey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, National Geographic, NOAA, New England Aquarium, Ocean Conservancy, Oceania, Pew Charitable Trusts, Sea Web, Save Our Seas, Scrips Institution of Oceanography, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, World Heritage Marine Programmer.

Korea Gallery The Korea Gallery is a special showcase to celebrate Korean traditions and examine its unique influence and complex role in the world today. The exhibit expresses the continuity of the past by highlighting enduring features of Korean culture that have influence and resonance today. The exhibit uses the Smithsonian ceramics collection as well as a rich selection of photographs, ritual objects and traditional Korean carpentry to communicate and connect to both the local Korean community and an international audience. Traditional art forms, such as ceramics and calligraphy, along with mythological figures, language, large feature photographs and illustrations speak to a range of shared historical memories that connect Koreans at home and abroad. Personal stories of modern Koreans, as told in their own voices, provide a context to discuss some of the many issues that face the divided country today. Korea's incredible transformation from 'The Hermit Kingdom' to a world power is traced through its impact on the arts, the economy and popular culture. The exhibit was designed by Reich + Petch.

The current mayor of Hiroshima, Kazumi Matsui, is the President of the organization as of his April 2011 inauguration. Mayors for Peace was started in Japan, and since then Mayors throughout the World have signed on. When Mayors sign on, it means they support the commencement of negotiations towards the elimination of nuclear weapons by the year 2020.

It was launched under the name 'Emergency Campaign to Ban Nuclear Weapons' in November of that year at the 2nd Citizens Assembly for the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons held in Nagasaki, Japan. In August 2005, the World Conference endorsed continuation of the Campaign under the title of the '2020 Vision Campaign'. From May 2008 till May 2009, the main focus of the work of the 2020 Vision Campaign has been the signature drive for the Cities Appeal in support of the Hiroshima-Nagasaki Protocol. The Protocol embeds the objective of the 2020 Vision Campaign in a realistic framework. As a protocol to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), it seeks to challenge national governments to follow through on the commitments they made in Article VI the Treaty. By signing the Cities Appeal, Mayors and elected local officials around the world are given the chance to get behind the Hiroshima-Nagasaki Protocol ahead of the formal and final presentation of the results of the international signature drive at the 2010 NPT Review Conference at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.  Activities in the U.S.  In western Massachusetts, a campaign was spearheaded from grassroots organizers in eleven towns. After two years of hard working starting in the autumn of 2005 and continuing today, all eleven Western Mayors have signed on to the campaign. This encouraged some legislative action, and the state Republicans brought forth a resolution for nuclear abolition by 2020 which passed in the Massachusetts House and Senate. Senator Ted Kennedy was asked to bring the resolution to the federal level. However, after Kennedy died, there are no plans to see the resolution at a national level.  2011 Nobel Peace Prize nomination  Mayors for Peace were nominated for 2011 Nobel Peace Prize by 1976 Peace Prize laureate Mairead Maguire.

The museum was initially endowed during the 1960s with the permanent art collection of Joseph H. Hirshhorn. It was designed by architect Gordon Bunshaft and is part of the Smithsonian Institution. It was conceived as the United States' museum of contemporary and modern art and currently focuses its collection-building and exhibition- planning mainly on the post‚ÄìWorld War II period, with particular emphasis on art made during the last 50 years. The Hirshhorn is sited halfway between the Washington Monument and the US Capitol, anchoring the southernmost end of the so-called L'Enfant axis (perpendicular to the Mall's green carpet). The National Archives/National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden across the Mall, and the National Portrait Gallery/Smithsonian American Art building several blocks to the north, also mark this pivotal axis, a key element of both the 1791 city plan by Pierre L'Enfant and the 1901 MacMillan Plan. The building itself is an attraction, an open cylinder elevated on four massive \\"legs,\\" with a large fountain occupying the central courtyard. Before architect Gordon Bunshaft designed the building, the Smithsonian staff reportedly told him that, if it did not provide a striking contrast to everything else in the city, then it would be unfit for housing a modern art collection.  History  Founding In the late 1930s, the United States Congress mandated an art museum for the National Mall. At the time, the only venue for visual art was the National Gallery of Art, which focuses on Dutch, French, and Italian art. During the 1940s World War II shifted the project into the background. Meanwhile, Joseph H. Hirshhorn, now in his forties and enjoying great success from uranium-mining investments, began creating his collection from classic French Impressionism to works by living artists, American modernism of the early 20th century, and sculpture. Then, in 1955, Hirshhorn sold his uranium interests for more than $50-million. He expanded his collection to warehouses, an apartment in New York City, and an estate in Greenwich, Connecticut, with extensive area for sculpture. A 1962 sculpture show at New York's Guggenheim Museum awakened an international art community to the breadth of Hirshhorn's holdings. Word of his collection of modern and contemporary paintings also circulated, and institutions in Italy, Israel, Canada, California, and New York City vied for the collection. President Lyndon B. Johnson and Smithsonian Secretary S. Dillon Ripley successfully campaigned for a new museum on the National Mall. In 1966, an Act of Congress established the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian Institution. Most of the funding was federal, but Hirshhorn later contributed $1-million toward construction. Joseph and his fourth wife, Olga Zatorsky Hirshhorn, visited the White House. The groundbreaking was in 1969 and Abram Lerner was named the founding Director. He oversaw research, conservation, and installation of more than 6,000 items brought from the Hirshhorns' Connecticut estate and other properties to Washington, DC. Joseph Hirshhorn spoke at the inauguration (1974), saying: One million visitors saw the 850-work inaugural show in the first six months. Institutional leadership Kiepenkerl by Jeff Koons (1987) In 1984, James T. Demetrion, fourteen-year director of the Des Moines Art Center in Iowa, succeeded Abram Lerner as the Hirshhorn's director. Art collector and retail store founder Sydney Lewis of Richmond, Virginia, succeeded Senator Daniel P. Moynihan as board chairman.Hirshhorn Museum Official Site Demetrion held the post for more than 17 years. Ned Rifkin became director in February 2002, returning to the Hirshhorn after directorship positions at the Menil Collection in Texas and the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, Georgia. Rifkin was previously chief curator of the Hirshhorn from 1986 until 1991. In October 2003, Rifkin was named Under Secretary for Art of the Smithsonian. In 2005, Olga Viso was named director of the Hirshhorn. Viso joined the curatorial department of the Hirshhorn in 1995 as assistant curator, was named associate curator in 1998, and served as curator of contemporary art from 2000 to 2003. In October 2003, Viso was named deputy director of the Hirshhorn, a post she held until her 2005 promotion to director. After two years, Ms. Viso accepted the position of Director of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, departing in December 2007. Chief Curator and Deputy Director Kerry Brougher served as Acting Director for more than a year until an international search led to the hiring of Richard Koshalek, who was named the fifth director of the Hirshhorn in February, 2009. Hirshhorn Sculpture Garden: cards for Yoko Ono's 2007 Wish Tree for Washington, DC Richard Koshalek (born 1942) was president of Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, Calif., from 1999 until January 2009. Before that, he served as director of The Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles for nearly 20 years. At both institutions, he was noted for his commitment to new artistic initiatives, including commissioned works, scholarly exhibitions and publications and the building of new facilities that garnered architectural acclaim. He worked with architect Frank Gehry on the design and construction of MOCA's Geffen Contemporary (1983), a renovated warehouse popularly known as the Temporary Contemporary. He also worked with the Japanese architect Arata Isozaki on the museum's permanent home in Los Angeles (1986). Koshalek resigned in 2013 after the Bloomberg Bubble controversy (see below). On June 5, 2014, Hirshhorn trustees announced that they had hired Melissa Chiu, director of Asia Society Museum in New York City, to be the Hirshhorn's new director. Chiu, who was born in Darwin, Australia, is a scholar of contemporary Chinese art. Chiu oversaw the Hirshhorn's 40th anniversary celebration in the fall of 2014. Chiu began her tenure at the Hirshhorn in September 2014. Collection highlights Notable artists in the collection include: Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Mary Cassatt, Thomas Eakins, Henry Moore, Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Franz Kline, Hans Hofmann, Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland, John Chamberlain, Francis Bacon, Willem de Kooning, Milton Avery, Ellsworth Kelly, Louise Nevelson, Arshile Gorky, Edward Hopper, Larry Rivers, and Raphael Soyer among others.

The Seasonal Inflatable Structure, to be called the \\"Bloomberg Bubble,\\" was due to be erected in 2013 and would be inflated annually for one two-month period. It was supposed to create a 14,000-square-foot space for performance and lectures. Designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro, the proposal won a progressive architecture award from Architect magazine. Hirshhorn officials began reconsidering the Bubble in 2013. Construction cost estimates for the structure more than tripled to $15.5 million from $5 million, and no major gifts for the project were received between 2010 and May 2013. A Hirshhorn study also concluded that the cost of programming (such as symposia and special events) using the Bubble were likely to run a $2.8 million annual deficit. The Hirshhorn's board of directors evenly split on a vote to proceed with the project in May 2013. In the wake of the vote, seen as a referendum on his leadership, museum director Richard Koshalek announced he would resign by the end of 2013.Parker, Lonnae O'Neal. \\"Hirshhorn Director Plans to Resign After Board Splits on 'Bubble' Project.\\" Washington Post.

Architecture Portrait of Joseph H Hirshhorn, by Pablo Serrano The museum was designed by architect Gordon Bunshaft (1909‚Äì1990) and provides of exhibition space inside and nearly four acres outside in its two-level Sculpture Garden and plaza. The New York Times described it as: \\"a fortress of a building that works as a museum.\\" An original plan with a reflecting pool across the Mall was approved in July 1967. When excavation started, a controversy arose, resulting in a revised design, with a smaller footprint, which was approved on July 1, 1971.A Garden for Art, Valerie J. Fletcher, LOC # 97-61991, p.19-20 ;Technical InformationHirshhorn Museum & Sculpture Garden Official Website: Technical Information * Building and walls surfaced with precast concrete aggregate of \\"Swenson\\" pink granite * Building is in diameter; interior court, ; fountain, * Building is high, elevated on four massive, sculptural piers * of exhibition space on three floors * of total exhibition space, indoors and outdoors * 274-seat auditorium (lower level) * around and under the museum building * 1.3-acre sculpture garden across Jefferson Drive sunken below street level, ramped for accessibility * Second- and third-floor galleries have 15-foot-high walls, with exposed 3-foot-deep coffered ceilings * Lower level includes exhibition space, storage, workshops, offices * Fourth floor includes offices, storage ;Architectural timeline * 1969. The Hirshhorn Museum groundbreaking takes place on the former site of the Army Medical Museum and Library (built 1887) after the brick structure is demolished. A controversy soon develops over naming a building on the historic National Mall after a living person, as well as the new federal museum's modern look and intrusively expansive sculptural grounds. * 1971. Amid this climate of controversy, Bunshaft's original conception for the Sculpture Garden-an elongated, sunken rectangle crossing the Mall with a large reflecting pool-is abandoned. He prepares a new design based on an idea outlined by art critic Benjamin Forgey in a Washington Star article. The new adaptation shifts the garden's Mall orientation from perpendicular to parallel and reduces its size from to . The design is deliberately stark, using gravel surfaces and minimal plantings to visually emphasize the works of art. * 1974. The museum opens with three floors of painting galleries, a fountain plaza for sculpture, and the Sculpture Garden. In preparation for the opening, Hirshhorn curators and staff spend several months scrupulously planning the locations of artworks, both indoors and outdoors. Lightweight foam-core \\"dummy\\" sculptures are used to resolve the final placement of works in the garden. The originals, many of which had been airlifted from Hirshhorn's Connecticut estate onto flatbed trucks for transport, are put into place in the weeks before the opening. * 1981. Closed since the summer of 1979, the Sculpture Garden reopens in September after a renovation and redesign by Lester Collins, a well-known landscape architect and founder of the Innesfree Foundation. The design introduces plantings, paved surfaces, accessibility ramps, and areas of lawn. * 1985. The Museum Shop is moved to the lobby, increasing exhibition space at its former location on the lower level. * 1993. Closed since December 1991, the Hirshhorn Plaza reopens after a renovation and redesign by landscape architect James Urban. The area around and under the building is repaved in two tones of gray granite, and raised areas of grass and trees are added to the east and west. * 2014. The Museum Shop is moved back to the lower level. The ongoing installation of Barbara Kruger's Belief and Doubt connects the shop with the lower level exhibition space. ;Comments and criticisms * \\"The whole complex has been designed as one composition ... Bunshaft's design is not concerned with the grandeur of the Mall. It is concerned with the greater grandeur of his museum and it gives us an awful lot of beaux-arts pavement and pomposity that no longer seem to suit the taste and style of our times.\\" [Preliminary design criticized] Wolf Von Eckhardt, The Washington Post, February 6, 1971. * \\"The circular plan is not only clear, but also provides a pleasant processional sequence that goes a long way. ... The fortress quality of the Hirshhorn suggests some rather obvious thoughts about the nature of housing art in our time. But the building's architecture ... is less the product of a desire to make a statement ... than it is a logical progression in aesthetic development. ... \\" Paul Goldberger, The New York Times, October 2, 1974. * \\"[The building] is known around Washington as the bunker or gas tank, lacking only gun emplacements or an Exxon sign ... It totally lacks the essential factors of esthetic strength and provocative vitality that make genuine 'brutalism' a positive and rewarding style. This is born-dead, neo- penitentiary modern. Its mass is not so much aggressive or overpowering as merely leaden.\\" Ada Louise Huxtable, The New York Times, October 6, 1974. * \\"The parched severity of [the original Sculpture Garden] was not without merit, but the appeal was more to the mind than to the senses, more theoretical than practical. ... The new design reinforces the identity of the garden as a welcoming urban park. ... [This] park for art ... serves the sculpture. The divisions of the space prove essential accents; artworks pop in and out of view as the spectator moves about the space. ... \\" Benjamin Forgey, The Washington Post, September 12, 1981. * \\"[The Hirshhorn is] the biggest piece of abstract art in town ‚Äì a huge, hollowed cylinder raised on four massive piers, in absolute command of its walled compound on the Mall. ... The circular fountain ... is a grand concoction ... that for good reason has become the museum's visual trademark.\\" Benjamin Forgey, The Washington Post, November 4, 1989.

It opened in the fall of 1986 in the space of a former electronics store and closed May 30, 2004. History Nell's opened in the fall of 1986 in the space of a former electronics store. It came onto the scene when some clubgoers were tiring of the cavernous discoth√®ques (e.g., Studio 54) popular in the 1970s and early 1980s. Decorated as a slightly shabby 19th-century English men's club, Nell's afforded its upscale patrons a place to eat, sit, socialize, and listen to live music. Other exclusive supper clubs like M.K. and Au Bar soon followed. Actress-singer Nell Campbell was its namesake and longtime proprietress. Initially, she co-owned the club with Lynn Wagenknecht and Keith McNally. McNally gave up ownership when he and Wagenknecht divorced. The painter Thomas Moller was Nell's original manager. Moller takes credit for attracting New York's art scene to the club. Also a 1985 Interview Magazine included Nell and Christian Lepanto in different articles. Christian L worked as coatcheck and introduced Semour Stein to Tommy Page. At its peak of popularity in the late 1980s, with a capacity of only 250, Nell's was known for denying even the famous entry to the club. The bathrooms were coke dens. It was the quiet hookup place for Rob Lowe and Melissa Gilbert. Prince also visited as well as Al Franken. It was the last nightclub Andy Warhol attended with Dionne Warwick just before his botched hospital visit in which he died. On June 4, 1987, artist Robert Mapplethorpe and actress Susan Sarandon hosted a dinner for AIDS charity amfAR at Nell's.Anne-Marie Schiro (June 5, 1987), Artists Rally To Fight AIDS New York Times. In the 1990s Nell's matured into a jazz, reggae, and hip-hop showcase. Run-DMC was often known to take over the DJ booth on any given night. In 1995, The Notorious B.I.G. made his video for \\"Big Poppa\\" there. It was also there in 1993 that Tupac met a woman who accused him of sexual assault Nell's was also a frequent haunt of fictional character Patrick Bateman, in the book American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis. In early 2004, actor Mark Wahlberg was planning to buy Nell's. It closed on May 30, 2004. The space later held a private club NA opened by actor Chris Noth and his business partner Noel Ashman. Noel Ashman then teamed up with new partners to open semi-private club NA in 2005. Several other clubs opened and closed in the space before the space split into two to become Stash nightclub, which lies underneath Snap Sports Bar.

It was originally both a coin and a weight in ancient Greece. The unit of volume is more correctly called a fluid dram, fluid drachm, fluidram or fluidrachm (abbreviated fl dr, ∆í 3, or f í).

A coin weighing one drachma is known as a stater, drachm, or drachma. The Ottoman dirhem was based on the Sassanian drachm, which was itself based on the Roman dram/drachm. British unit of mass The British Weights and Measures Act of 1878 introduced verification and consequent stamping of apothecary weights, making them officially recognized units of measurement. By 1900, Britain had enforced the distinction between the avoirdupois and apothecaries' versions by making the spelling different: *dram now meant only avoirdupois drams, which were of an avoirdupois ounce of 437.5 grains, thus equal to 27.34 grains *drachm now meant only apothecaries' drachms, which were of an apothecaries' ounce of 480 grains, thus equal to 60 grains Modern unit of mass In the avoirdupois system, the dram is the mass of pound or ounce. The dram weighs grains, or exactly grams. In the apothecaries' system, which was widely used in the United States until the middle of the 20th century, the dram is the mass of pounds apothecaries (lb ap), or ounces apothecaries (oz ap or ‚Ñ•) (the pound apothecaries and ounce apothecaries are equal to the troy pound (lb t), and troy ounce (oz t), respectively). The dram apothecaries is equal to or , or exactly grams. \\"Dram\\" is also used as a measure of the powder charge in a shotgun shell, representing the equivalent of black powder in drams avoirdupois.

Earlier version first published in New English Dictionary, 1911. However, by 1876 the teaspoon had grown considerably larger than it was previously, measuring 80‚Äì85 minims. As there are 60 minims in a fluid dram, using this equivalent for the dosage of medicine was no longer suitable. Today's US teaspoon is equivalent to exactly 4.92892159375 ml, which is also US fluid ounces, US fluid drams, or 80 US minims. While pharmaceuticals are measured nowadays exclusively in metric units, fluid drams are still used to measure the capacity of pill containers. Dram is used informally to mean a small amount of spirituous liquor, especially Scotch whisky. Earlier version first published in New English Dictionary, 1897. The unit is referenced by the phrase dram shop, the US legal term for an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages.

The character first appeared in a special insert in DC Comics Presents #26 (October 1980), and was created by writer Marv Wolfman and artist George P√©rez. A Cambion, daughter of a demon father (Trigon) and human mother (Arella), Raven is a powerful empath who can sense emotions and control her \\"soul-self\\", which can fight physically, as well as act as Raven's eyes and ears away from her physical body; more recently, she's been shown as being adept with various types of magic and sorcery. She is a prominent member of the superhero team Teen Titans. The character also goes by the alias Rachel Roth as a false civilian name. Raven has appeared in numerous cartoon television shows and films, including as one of the Teen Titans in Cartoon Network's eponymous series, voiced by Tara Strong, and in the 2014-2020 DC Animated Movie Universe, voiced by Taissa Farmiga. Rachel Roth makes her live adaptation debut in the DC Universe and HBO Max series Titans, played by Teagan Croft. Character biography First life of Raven Raven initially approached the Justice League for help, but they refused her on the advice of Zatanna, who sensed her demonic parentage.New Teen Titans (vol. 1) #4 In desperation, she reformed the Teen Titans as the New Teen Titans to fight her father. The team consisted of Robin, Kid Flash, Wonder Girl, Starfire, Cyborg, and Beast Boy (then known as Changeling).The New Teen Titans (vol. 1) #1 Raven and her new friends later came to think of one another as family. Trigon soon took Raven to his home dimension. The Titans defeated Trigon and sealed him in an interdimensional prison with the help of Arella, who stayed at the interdimensional door as Trigon's Guardian.New Teen Titans (vol. 1) #6 However, Raven continued to fight her father's influence, and her face started changing. For a period of time, Raven lost control several times in stressful situations, but managed to regain control before Trigon could assert himself. Eventually, Trigon escaped his prison and destroyed Azarath, came to Earth, and took control of Raven. The Titans were manipulated to kill Raven, thereby allowing the souls of Azarath contained inside the ring of Azar to possess her and use her as a channel to kill Trigon. After this battle, Raven rose from the ashes, cleansed of Trigon's evil, and vanished.New Teen Titans (vol. 2) #1‚Äì5 Raven After Raven's disappearance, Arella went around the world in search of Raven. She tracked Raven down, but both of them were kidnapped by Brother Blood. The minions of Brother Blood used Raven to control Nightwing (formerly Robin) as part of Blood's plans. The Titans rescued them both and prevented Brother Blood from returning to power.New Teen Titans (vol. 2) #31 As a result of the defeat of Trigon, Raven was free to experience emotions for the first time in her life. Raven found she was able to not only sense, but control others' emotions.New Teen Titans (vol. 2) #32 She learned to handle this power only after unintentionally making Nightwing believe that he loved her when she thought that she was in love with him. Raven also fostered a relationship with technopath Eric Forrester, who was using the life force of women he seduced to regain some of his lost humanity. Forrester knew that Raven's soul-self could help him to permanently retain his humanity. This attempt was cut short by the intervention of Joseph Wilson (Jericho), who helped Raven overcome her love for Forrester by destroying Forrester and saving Raven.New Titans #67 Evil Raven makes her appearance in the \\"Terror of Trigon\\" storyline, which began The New Teen Titans (vol. 2).

Raven was later kidnapped by the Wildebeest Society during the \\"Titans Hunt\\" storyline.New Titans #71 The Wildbeest, led by the Trigon-possessed souls of Azarath, were going to use several Titans to bring about the return of Trigon. During a massive battle, Raven was possessed by the evil souls and once again became the evil doppelg√§nger of her father. Arella, along with Danny Chase, used the power of Azar's soul to cleanse Raven. In the aftermath, Raven's body was destroyed, and Arella and Danny sacrificed themselves and joined the cleansed souls of Azarath to become Phantasm.New Titans #84 Evil Raven Raven appeared possessed by her evil conscience and attempted to implant Trigon's seed into new bodies. She interrupted Nightwing and Starfire's wedding and implanted a seed of Trigon into Starfire. Instead of corrupting her, she actually implanted the soul of the good Raven. This caused Starfire to leave Earth in order to escape from the evil Raven. The Titans were able to defeat Raven only because of the help they received from Phantasm.New Titans #121 Raven later returned, still evil, in order to destroy the good version of herself implanted in Starfire. With the help of the Titans, evil Raven was reduced to ashes, and the good part of Raven was given a new, golden spirit body, which was completely free of her father's demonic influence. In New Tamaran, Starfire and the golden spirit form of Raven revealed that implanting Raven's soul in Starfire was actually her plan to get rid of her demonic soul.New Titans #130 Spirit In her bodiless spirit form, Raven returned to Earth to help extract Cyborg's soul and consciousness from the Technis planet's computer mind.JLA vs Titans #1-3 Later, she was instrumental in defeating Imperiex by aiding Wonder Woman and Tempest in re-powering Darkseid.Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #173 As a spirit, Raven wandered the Earth, looking for her place in the world. Rebirth While the spirit of Raven was looking for her place in the world, Brother Blood came to claim her. Her spirit was instilled into the body of a teenage girl by the Church of Blood. The Teen Titans (reformed again), discovered that the Church of Blood were worshipers of Raven's father, Trigon. They also found a prophecy which told of the marriage between Brother Blood and Raven that would result in Armageddon. The new team interrupted the wedding, and Raven forced the cult to escape. She then joined the new Teen Titans and enrolled at a high school as Rachel Roth, using her mother's original surname.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #11 After her rebirth, Raven began developing romantic feelings for her teammate, Garfield Logan (Beast Boy), and the two became romantically attached. 52 In 52, after the death of Superboy, the Titans began to fall apart. Robin joins Batman, and Wonder Girl left the team. Beast Boy struggled to maintain the team, and new members who joined were only interested in seeking fame and honor rather than actually looking to fulfill justice. When Beast Boy decided to help Steel on a mission, most of the members left, leaving only Raven and Zatara. Later, Beast Boy, Raven, Offspring and Aquagirl aid Steel in launching an attack on LexCorp. Raven also participated in World War III. Eventually, Robin, Wonder Girl, and a few new members join the Titans, making the team whole again.

After beating the Titans East, she gives hints that she still loves Garfield, but he refuses to dwell on the matter, leaving their relationship uncertain.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #47 Following the death of Bart Allen, Raven, along with the other adult Titans, decides to leave the team. Raven decides to pursue her chance at attending high school, having never had the opportunity before. Raven stars in a five-issue miniseries written by Marv Wolfman, with art by Damion Scott. It takes place during the missing year, following Raven's attempts at living as a normal teenage girl and attending high school. Unfortunately, she gets inadvertently drawn into a mystical fight involving the Medusa Mask and has to battle for the lives of her classmates. In the Wizard #177 magazine, Wolfman briefly described the series, saying, \\"She needs to be on her own and in charge of herself for the first time in her life. This is more than just a 'tale of Raven'; it sets up her new life\\". Titans Raven discovers that Trigon had more than one child, and that a trio of children devoted to her father are behind the attacks. She is affected along with many of the other Titans by these three beings. Raven's three half-brothers use her and Beast Boy as keys to open a portal to Trigon's realm. Raven uses her own power to influence greed in others to make her half-brothers steal what little power Trigon had left. The portal is closed and Trigon's sons, believing they have gained great power, leave. Raven's half-brothers later return and provoke her demonic side, causing her to leave the Titans and join them. However, the team was able to track them down and convince Raven to join the side of good once more. She later provided a number of other artifacts, all capable of killing her, to the Titans as terms for her staying with the team.Titans (vol. 2) #6 Wyld Beast Boy and Raven share a romantic kiss, cementing their love for each other.

While she was recovering, Beast Boy stated that he was still in love with her and would remain so, despite whatever difficulties were involved.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #76 Raven decided to stay with the Teen Titans, now acting as a mentor to the younger members. When the Teen Titans attempted to return home, Raven was kidnapped and taken to another dimension by Wyld.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #82 Wyld reveals that Raven was the one who created him. When Raven was traveling dimensions looking for her father, her soul self caused all of the animals she visited to merge into one being: the Wyld. The Titans enter the Wyld World to rescue Raven. Wyld is eventually destroyed by Static. In the final issue of this incarnation of the Titans, Superboy-Prime and his Legion of Doom attack Titan's Tower. Raven stops Kid Flash just before he can kill Inertia. Then she reveals her soul-self to Headcase, terrifying and in so defeating him. After the Legion of Doom is defeated and Superboy- Prime is bound to the Source Wall, Beast Boy and Raven have a talk about her difficulty in reading Solstice's emotions, and their encounter with Headcase. Eventually, Raven starts to open up about her true feelings. While it was her inner darkness that scarred her entire life, she was even more frightened of what her love for Beast Boy might cause her to do. Beast Boy makes it clear he doesn't want to escape from any part of her. Touched, Raven decides that she needs to embrace the positive feelings inside her rather than just her negative ones. Beast Boy assures her this is part of being human, and points out, \\"I think you've worried enough about the bad...so why don't we focus on the good for a change?\\" With that, they share a heartfelt kiss to renew their relationship and ultimately embrace their love for each other.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #100 The New 52 Raven in the New 52. Art by Kenneth Rocafort. After the events of the 2011 \\"Flashpoint\\" series, the history of the DC Universe was altered, resulting in The New 52. Raven makes her New 52 debut in the first issue of the Phantom Stranger. There she is shown as a girl in a black and white striped sweater becoming distraught at a funeral over the level of overwhelming emotion that is emanating from the people there. The Phantom Stranger takes Raven to Stonehenge, the portal between Earth and the realm of Trigon. Being told by a \\"higher power\\" what must be done, the reluctant Stranger unwillingly hands her over to Trigon. Teen Titans Raven makes her first Teen Titans appearance in Teen Titans #16. Raven, sporting a new costume, is introduced by Trigon as his \\"Black Bird of Terror\\" to his minions. It is strongly suggested that Raven has been controlling Robin's emotions. During Trigon's invasion on Earth, she approaches a near dead Beast Boy who had been assaulted by Deathstroke earlier in the remains of the Ravagers facility.The Ravagers #12 After being touched by Raven, Beast Boy awakens and when he asks if Harvest has sent her, she apologizes stating that she brought him into the fray much sooner than she expected, and says, \\"Hush. We are birds of a feather now... You are mine to control\\", as Raven mind- controls him and teleports them to New York where Trigon and the Teen Titans are in battle.Teen Titans #19 Raven's origins revisited Trigon reveals more of Raven's origins. He has a son from each world he's conquered, but Raven is his only daughter. Trigon let Raven's mother, Arella, live because he considered that Raven needed to be raised by humans so she could recreate the seven under-realms in her own image. Arella fled with her daughter to Azarath where the monks taught her how to control her dark side and avoid Trigon's influence on her. Years later, she escaped from Azarath in order to protect her mentors and planet from Trigon and fled to the Earth where Phantom Stranger captured her for Trigon.Teen Titans (2011), Issue 23A Raven spent time in the under-realms where time flows faster or was compressed. Trigon thought he only needed to liberate her and not control her to make Raven have her own image. Apparently impressed, Trigon handed her the Throne of the Under-realms to rule the place as Queen. Return of Trigon Back in New York, Trigon's three sons, Belial, Ruskoff, and Suge, assault the Teen Titans to take Raven back. Raven, Beast Boy, and the Titans defeat them, but Trigon himself appears again and takes control of the Titans save for Red Robin, Raven and Beast Boy. The manipulated Titans attack, and while Raven and Beast Boy distract them and Trigon, Tim cuts through Trigon's eyes with his inertrite wings. Trigon, pulling out the wings from his eyes, compliments Tim before suddenly disappearing. Soon after, a woman and a group of suited men come through a portal, informing that they will take Psimon into custody and make the incident appear as if it had never happened. When questioned about the police officers Psimon has killed, the woman reveals it has been a hallucination by Trigon, so therefore it has never happened. Raven and Beast Boy are re-accepted into the Teen Titans. Raven brings controversy to the team by revealing the flirtatious relationships Tim had when under Trigon's control. Raven goes into her room, leaving the awkward situation behind. There, she summons her father, saying, \\"Father, I am one of them. Your plan worked perfectly\\", leaving questions on what side she is really playing for. Meanwhile, Tim calls Raven aside, telling that if something happens to him, the team will look up to her to lead them. Forever Evil After the events of \\"Trinity War\\", the Earth's greatest heroes are gone and the Crime Syndicate of America has taken over the world. The Teen Titans challenge the Crime Syndicate, but are easily overpowered by Johnny Quick and Atomica and then flung into the time stream. While the Titans are constantly flung through time, Raven is sent a few thousand years back in time. There, she is challenged by Etrigan the Demon, who recognizes her as Trigon's daughter and tries to kill her. Raven is saved by Wonder Girl, who suggests that the way to stop Raven's powers, since she was born and raised in a world between worlds, is to manipulate the energy within the time stream. Raven succeeds in anchoring the Titans with her soul-self, teleporting them through time. The Titans arrive 20 years into the future, where the son of Superman, Jon Lane Kent, has massacred most of Earth's superheroes, leaving only a few, including Beast Boy (Garfield Logan), now calling himself Beast Man, and Rose Wilson. Superboy Kon-El and Jon battle, and Kon triumphs. But Kon is sent elsewhere by an unknown power, and a severely injured Jon is swapped unknowingly as Superboy by Logan and Wilson. The Titans depart again, now to an alien planet in the 30th century, where Kid Flash is actually a rebel leader and war criminal, Bar Torr. While the Titans stay to witness the Trial of Kid Flash, Raven deduces Superboy is actually Jon, and helps send him back to the present time so that he can find a cure for his deteriorating body condition. Leaving Kid Flash and Solstice in the future, the Titans return to their original time and are united with Bunker, Beast Boy, and Skitter. Raven finds out that their journey has severed Trigon's control over her. Followed by an attack by the villain Grimm, the Titans plan a final attack on Harvest's new colony. Raven is reluctant to join because of her past actions, but Bunker tells her that everybody deserves a second chance, and Raven changes her mind. In the colony, they are surprised to find that everyone is returned to normal, and even the victims of the Culling have been restored to life. Raven plays a crucial role by finding out Harvest's scheme to extract all the metagenes to create a massive DNA strand for his usage. This is destroyed by Raven's soul-self and Harvest is finally defeated. Rebirth Some time after leaving the Teen Titans, Raven set out to learn more about her human relatives in San Francisco. Raven attempted to conceal her powers before having a misadventure and then later abducted by Damian Wayne who recruited her to be part of the new Teen Titans team he was establishing to take down his grandfather Ra's al Ghul. It is then revealed that the Demon's Fist, a team initially led by Damian before he decided to follow Batman, were hunting each of the assembled Titans that Damian had abducted for their initiation into the League of Assassins. Raven turns out to be the target of the assassin by the name of Plague, whose hands can rot, decay and take the life out of anything she touches. In this series of Rebirth, Raven and Kid Flash develop a mutual crush, but go their separate ways. Powers and abilities As a Cambion, Raven has an array of abilities; she is firstly an empath, able to sense and alter the emotions of others. She can induce calm, suppress negativity, and even make someone fall in love with her. By absorbing the pain of the wounded into herself, she can induce rapid healing for the affected person. Raven can astral project a solid black energy form that takes the shape of a bird, called her soul-self. Her soul-self can travel long distances, become intangible, and is able to telepathically communicate. It can act as a shield as it can absorb a limited amount of energy and solid matter, regurgitating them before reintegrating with Raven. Using her soul-self, she can convert her physical body into her soul-self and carry or teleport herself and others over a limited distance. Her soul-self can mentally subdue at least one person by enveloping them inside of itself. Raven's soul-self could initially stay outside her body for exactly five minutes; failure to reintegrate in time would cause mental torment for her, though she eventually overcame this limitation.New Teen Titans Volume 1, Issue #8June 1981 In her third body, Raven acquired the ability to fly. Raven is shown to be able to fly unaided in space. As the half-demon daughter of the inter-dimensional demon Trigon, Raven is very powerful and displayed a vast amount of abilities. She has displayed the ability to control, manipulate and or generate pure shadows and darkness. Raven can manipulate energy, time, and emotions. This latter ability manifests in different variations, from causing supremely destructive pain, inducing tension, fear-based illusions, and stealing emotions from others. In a number of instances, Raven has deep knowledge of magic and has also displayed sorcerous abilities, such as inducing unconsciousness on Tim Drake with a touch, releasing balls of fire \\"within the folds of her cloak\\" (as in The New Teen Titans Annual #4 (1988), or hurling electric blasts strong enough to take down all her brothers and all of the adult Titans. She was seen to completely annihilate the demon army of Rankor numbering more than three thousand individuals and which contained powerful individual demons that had taken the Titans down in ambushes previously. Like her brothers, Raven can induce and amplify one of the seven deadly sins (in her case, pride) or all of them, in any living being, however doing so will cause her to suffer spells of nausea and vomiting for several days afterward as side effects. Raven also has limited precognition, which allows her to predict future events that are about to happen, although this happens involuntarily and infrequently. She has also been shown to be an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, despite the fact that she rarely uses these abilities. Other versions  * In The Books of Magic Annual #3, a version of the Teen Titans can be seen in Timothy Hunter's alternative reality. Raven's counterpart is named \\"Moonchild\\", and is a sidekick to the Phantom Stranger. * In the \\"Titans Tomorrow\\" storyline, Dark Raven, a future image of Raven, is a member of the Titans Tomorrow. She is referred to the \\"Wicked Witch of the West\\" because she consumed the emotions of most of the American continent in order to maintain peace. * In Amalgam Comics, an amalgamation of Raven and Marvel's Aliya Dayspring is called Raveniya Dayspring. * In the Superman/Batman Mash-Up universe, Doctor Destiny trapped Superman and Batman in a universe where there are amalgamations of a number of DC characters. Ravanna was an amalgamation of Raven and Zatanna, and was a deceased member of the Justice Titans. Her costume is kept as a memorial.Superman/Batman #60-61 * In DC/Wildstorm: DreamWar, Raven appears along with the rest of the Wolfman/Perez-era Teen Titans as part of Chimera's dream-fueled plot to make Wildstorms, wherein normally very brutal heroes act like his dream heroes from the DC Universe. Initial appearance had the original Titans Tower appear out of nowhere on top of the Riker's Island prison facility. Mr. Majestic is sent in to investigate but is brought low by a Starbolt and a single touch from Raven before most of the Titans make their escape. She next appears alongside the other Teen Titans as they engage the members of Gen 13. As the heroes of DC, animated as they are, realize they are being used by Chimera and cease fighting and revert to a more cautious approach to the world around them, Chimera decides to dream up villains such as Doomsday to continue with his wishes before resorting to hatching a Sun- Eater inside the moon. While most of the capable heroes travel to the moon to prevent the Sun-Eater destroying it, Raven along with the Midnighter, independently of each other, deducts where Chimera was hiding through Edgar Allan Poe's Purloined Letter, both deducing that Chimera was hiding in plain sight. After a brief fight with the Shadow-Thief, brought low by a glimpse into Raven's mind, they eventually find the shrunken Chimera before waking him up, causing all of the DC characters to disappear, but leaving the damage behind. * Raven is a major character in Tiny Titans, in which she lives at home with her father Trigon, who substitutes as a teacher at her school. * In the Booster Gold series, Black Beetle has moved back in time to corrupt history. In battle between the Teen Titans against Deathstroke and the Ravager, Black Beetle kills the Titans save for Raven, who had shown up a moment after. Booster Gold, Skeets, and Rip Hunter arrive at the scene and tell Raven that history has been rampaged, and ask her to help them track down Black Beetle. Raven accompanies them to an alternate future where the New Teen Titans never existed and Trigon had taken over the earth. They track down Black Beetle but he escapes into the timestream. They return to the time of the battle with the Ravager and to correct the timestream. Booster knocks Deathstroke out, suits up in his armor, and replicates the scene. Before departing with Ravager's body, Booster tells Robin, \\"Embrace your heritage and guide Damian\\". Meanwhile, Raven plants false memories into Deathstroke's mind, so that he will forever blame the Titans for his son's death and will become the greatest adversary of the Teen Titans.Booster Gold Vol. 2 #23~24 * In the alternate timeline of the \\"Flashpoint\\" storyline, Raven is a member of the Secret Seven, a group of powerful sorcerers of Earth. Raven, Zatanna, and Mindwarp are killed by Enchantress, who turns out to be a spy for the Amazon and has been ordered to infiltrate the Secret Seven. Enchantress is eventually killed by Superman. Curiously, Raven and Zatanna's relations to their fathers appear to have changed in thist. * In the alternate Injustice Timeline, Raven's father Trigon appears during a fight between the Regime and Insurgency; he is under the impression that the Regime are responsible for Raven's disappearance, courtesy of John Constantine's manipulations. Raven is awoken from her enchanted sleep just as her father engages in a cosmic battle with Mister Mxyzptlk which threatens to engulf them all. Raven tries to reach her father, only for Doctor Fate to intervene and banish her father and the imp to another dimension, killing Trigon. Year Four sees Raven briefly securing herself in a pocket dimension where she is confused over her grief about her father's death, considering how much she detested him. She questions where she truly belongs due to her demon/human status. In Year Five, Superman visits Raven to rejoin the Regime. She rejoins in Chapter 34 by using her dark magic to blackout Earth's power and Insurgency's plan to expose Superman's crimes. She and Cyborg capture Deathstroke at S.T.A.R labs. * In the DC Bombshells universe, Raven's mother was from Germany and fell in love with the beastly mountainous spirit, Das Trigon. Despite the hate she received from the other villagers from bearing Trigon's daughter, Azaria still raised Raven with care while teaching her some magic. After their village and townsfolk were killed by the Germans and Killer Frost, the Joker's Daughter took Raven in and forced her to use her magic to benefit the Third Reich. She initially appears when John Constantine and Zatanna (also victims of the Joker's Daughter) were cast into the ghetto, but was revealed to be Joker's Daughter in disguise who used Zatanna to know of the Bombshells' plans. Joker's Daughter then summons the real Raven (who's still under her control), to thwart the Bombshells against her will. However, some of her magic passes on to Miri Marvel, who works with Zatanna to break free of the Joker's Daughter's curse. She then works together with the Bombshells to defeat and depower the Joker's Daughter and her army.DC Bombshells #17 In other media Television =Live action= Teagan Croft as Rachel Roth/Raven in Titans * Raven appears as one of the main characters of the TV series Titans, portrayed by Teagan Croft. After her \\"mother\\" was murdered by an unknown male assailant, teenager Rachel Roth displays her exceptionally strong telekinetic abilities out of sheer fury and flees town. She is quickly abducted and taken to the police station, where she meets superhero and police detective Dick Grayson, whom she recognizes from her nightmares, and asks for his aid. Robin eventually forms a team of heroes to protect Rachel from her father and his acolytes while also training her to use her powers for good. Rachel eventually defeats her father and imprisons him in a small jewel, which she places on her forehead to ensure he can never escape. =Animation= Many of Raven's appearances are voiced by Tara Strong. * A teenage version of Raven appears in the Teen Titans animated series. One of the program's breakout characters, she was so popular that her later portrayals in comics made attempts to be closer to this version of her. Her costume is relatively the same as her comic counterpart, but her blue dress is replaced with a purple, hooded cloak and a black leotard in order to avoid several animation complications. Raven is depicted with light gray skin, violet-blue eyes, and shoulder-length violet-blue, a-line-styled hair. Her origin as the daughter of human Arella and interdimensional demon Trigon is the same as in the comics. This version chiefly employs powers which resemble telekinesis encased in dark-colored mystical energy. Raven's power is displayed under various forms. She accomplishes this by putting a little piece of her spirit/soul into everything she telekinetically controls. She often chants the incantation \\"Azarath Metrion Zinthos\\" to focus her abilities even further, allowing her to perform much greater feats; she also uses this phrase as a mantra while meditating. She has the ability to fly and levitate. Raven has also been seen as a fairly good hand-to-hand combatant, although she only occasionally uses this skill during battle. Another of Raven's chief abilities is her \\"soul-self\\", which allows her to detach her soul and spirit from her body in the form of a dark-energy Raven. This ability can be used to enter the minds of others, teleport herself and others across great distances, pass through solid matter or through fire, and even alter her own appearance. Raven has displayed a number of seldom-used abilities. She can heal herself and others (to an extent), stop time, and manifest her fears as monsters unintentionally. She keeps a library of numerous spell books in her room on the occult, as well as a number of immensely powerful items, charms and talismans. Raven's powers are entirely tied to her emotions, becoming more powerful and more unstable with the intensity of the emotions fueling them. Raven is often giving sage advice to the others about various subjects, and generally stays calm even in desperate situations. She is also the most emotionally restrained of the Titans, appearing secretive and distant. The reason for her emotional restraint is due to the adverse effects her emotions have on her supernatural abilities. However, she eventually warms up to her teammates and comes to see them as her family. The fourth season serves as an adaptation of the \\"Terror of Trigon\\" arc in the Teen Titans comics, and has five episodes that focus heavily on Raven. Over the course of the season, Raven tries to avoid her destiny of becoming the portal that will release Trigon into their dimension. However, with Slade having been empowered by Trigon, Raven loses hope and resigns to her fate. She leaves her teammates with a small fraction of her powers to protect them from Trigon's petrification blast when he emerges. Raven regresses into a small five-year- old child, and is rescued from the depths of Trigon's prison by Robin. Robin and the other Titans decide to fight anyway, though they are ultimately incapable of defeating Trigon. Their efforts convince Raven to step out of her father's shadow, and she vaporizes Trigon with a pure-white version of her soul-self, returning the world to normal in the process. In the fifth season of the show, she becomes more open and friendly, although her disposition to Beast Boy does not change. * Raven returns in the New Teen Titans shorts; and in one, she goes on a date with the Goth Boy. * Raven reappears in Teen Titans Go!. While her appearance remains mostly unchanged from the original Teen Titans series, it is later shown that her short hair is now black with purple streaks instead of violet purple. Also, in the episode \\"Hey Pizza\\", her leotard is jokingly referred to as a \\"bathing suit\\". This version of Raven is significantly more chatty and social than in her original series appearance, although she does occasionally show her dark side (though mostly when she is provoked or agitated). In \\"Legendary Sandwich\\", it is revealed that she loves the show Pretty Pretty Pegasus (a parody of My Little Pony, for which Strong voices Twilight Sparkle) but is afraid of any other \\"girly\\" thing (flowers, hearts, chocolates, and rabbits). Similar to the comics, she has a crush on Beast Boy which culminates in an actual mutual attraction in \\"Rocks and Water\\". They formally become a couple in the double episode \\"BBRae\\", which is titled after their \\"ship name\\" used by their fans as a couple. She has another superhero identity called \\"Lady Legasus\\", a superhero clad in gold and with powerful legs, as her name suggests. * Raven appears as a non-speaking cameo in the DC Super Friends short. * Raven appears in the DC Super Hero Girls season 4 two-part finale \\"Nevermore\\", in which her demon father is having use her magic to open a portal to Metropolis. She returns in the spin-off feature Legends of Atlantis, where she employs her 2003 series' trademark incantation \\"Azarath, Metrion, Zinthos\\". * Raven appears on OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes in the special \\"Crossover Nexus\\". This marks the first time her character has appeared in a non-DC property. *Raven was slated to appear as a supporting character in a planned Nightwing animated series. * Raven appeared on the 2019 series DC Super Hero Girls with Tara Strong reprising her role. Film * Raven appears in the Teen Titans animated series film adaptation Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo, with Tara Strong reprising her role again. * Raven appears as a main character in the animated film Justice League vs. Teen Titans, voiced by Taissa Farmiga. She is the center of the story as it revolves around her father, Trigon, attempting to conquer Earth by possessing the Justice League, using Raven as the portal. At fourteen years old, she bonds with Damian Wayne as they recognize each other as kindred souls. This version sports the dull-tinted skin tone of her 2003 TV series' version, and at one point also employs the latter's standard spell incantation (\\"Azarath, Metrion, Zinthos\\") to effect her magic. She manages to contain Trigon in a magical crystal, which she now wears on her forehead at all times. * Raven appears in the animated sequel Teen Titans: The Judas Contract, and is around 15/16 years old, with Farmiga reprising her role. She remains a close friend to Damian and has softened up emotionally, even cracking the occasional joke, trying to help Terra with apparent nightmares, and also bringing in a black dog as a pet (for Damian). * Raven appears in the animated film Justice League Dark: Apokolips War, with Farmiga reprising her role from the previous DCAMU films. She is Damian Wayne's love interest and the two (Nightwing and Starfire do not count as they were killed and resurrected losing their sanity and conscience respectively although they slowly regain them by the end) are the only surviving Titans as most of their teammates were killed during the Paradoom invasion when defending Titans Tower, and the two share a kiss at the very end while Flash resets the timeline. She, along with John Constatine and Superman, are one of the protagonists, with her struggles to keep Trigon contained a recurring conflict in the movie. * The Teen Titans Go! and original Teen Titans animated series versions of Raven appear in Teen Titans Go! vs. Teen Titans, with Tara Strong reprising the role for both. In addition, several alternate versions of Raven appear throughout the film, which include her counterparts from Tiny Titans, the New Teen Titans comic, and the DC Animated Movie Universe. Miscellaneous * In the four-issue miniseries Smallville: Harbinger, a young girl is kidnapped by Brother Blood to be used as an offering to summon the Sons of Trigon, the Seven Deadly Sins. The ritual is interrupted by Zatanna and Constantine. Zatanna frees the girl but Constantine runs away with the artifact he had been looking for; the Book of Magick. Brother Blood succeeds in summoning the Seven Sins using himself as a sacrifice, and the Sins chase after Zatanna and the girl. Constantine, seeing the spirits of those who have been killed because of him, changes his mind and uses Brother Blood's heart to defeat them. Later, Zatanna places the girl under Jay Garrick's care. When Speedy asks what to call her, she tells her name, \\"Rachel Roth\\", before concluding, \\"...but you can call me Raven\\". Video games * Raven is a playable character in the Teen Titans Game Boy Advance and console video games, with Tara Strong reprising her role in the latter. * Raven appears in DC Universe Online, voiced by Adriene Mishler. She has been possessed by her father Trigon as a part of a demonic invasion of Metropolis and Earth, using Raven.

If she is freed, she will join Hero players along with Zatanna, and Doctor Fate in battling Brother Blood, who is the catalyst for Trigon's invasion. Through small info clips found throughout the game, the player will learn that Circe is quite aggravated that Raven refuses to give in and desires her punished once she has what she wants, while Wonder Woman considers her a true hero for containing the dark forces within her and continuing the struggle against it.

If clicked repeatedly, she will remark on how she is not always sarcastic when she speaks. * Raven is a playable character in Injustice: Gods Among Us, with Tara Strong once again reprising her role but with a deeper and more demonic sounding voice (although a trailer featuring Green Lantern in Story Mode had her with the same voice as the television incarnation, suggesting that Strong's voice was filtered). Trigon appears as part of her super attack, and the Regime's Raven notes in a confrontation with Wonder Woman that she serves her world's Superman as Superman's actions will aid in her father's return. In her single player ending, the \\"normal\\" Raven, after having expended a large amount of demonic energy defeating Superman, realizes too late that she has summoned her father Trigon into the world.

He has the word \\"Kill!\\" tattooed on the back of his bottom lip. He spends time working with children in burn centers,Where Are They Now?: Kane Hodder and despite the roles he often plays, Hodder has often been described as a very friendly man who loves to meet his fans. For a long time, Hodder claimed his favorite kill scene in his films was the \\"sleeping bag against a tree\\" scene from Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood. He now considers the one where he rips a woman's face in half from Hatchet (2006) to be his favorite. Hodder is a noted Juggalo, a fan of the group Insane Clown Posse. To reflect this, he has a custom charm of the group's \\"hatchetman\\" logo holding a machete instead of a hatchet, a reference to his role as Jason. Hodder appeared on the December 4, 2012 episode of the TruTV show Hardcore Pawn, in which he had a miniature gold mask made from a piece a fan had made for him.

Al- Majaj held the position from 1994 to his deathhttps://books.google.de/books?id=nBnPuy2GxuQC&pg;=PA197&lpg; after Mayor Ruhi al-Khatib died on 5 July 1994. A year later Jordanian businessman Zaki Al-Ghul was selected as successor to this position, which does not entail direct responsibility for municipal services. The position is not recognized by Israel. Amin Majaj was a physician and a public servant. In the late 1940s and 1950s he made detailed research into malnutrition and its attendant diseases among children in the Palestinian refugee camps, and devised treatments for them. Born in Ramallah in 1921 to a well known Christian family that belonged to the Anglican Episcopal Church, Majaj was educated at St George's High School in Jerusalem (part of the Anglican bishopric), going on to the American University of Beirut in 1945 and to the University of London, where he studied medicine, specialising in child health. Back in Jordan, Majaj was confronted by a new and challenging situation. There were now half a million refugees from Palestine in Jordanian camps, kept alive by UNRWA rations. Many children were dying from gastroenteritis and deficiency diseases. Majaj realised that malnutrition among mothers was making breastfeeding ineffective and that lack of animal protein in the rations was the cause of iron-deficiency anemia, and protein deficiency resulting in diseases such as kwashiorkor. The remedy, a diet rich in animal proteins and vitamin B12 injections, was easier to recommend than to implement. His research continued until the children's wards in the Augusta Victoria Hospital in Jerusalem, where Majaj worked as head of the paediatrics department from 1950 to 1991, sustained a direct hit when the Israelis invaded the West Bank during the 1967 war. Majaj published the results of his research in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 1966, in the Gazette of the Egyptian Paediatric Association of 1960 and in British and German medical journals. He was paediatrician at the Makased Islamic Hospital in Jerusalem from 1967 to 1982 (director from 1977), as well as on the board of hospitals in Gaza and Nablus. He was on the Jerusalem municipal council from 1950 and at the time of his death was acting mayor of East Jerusalem. He also served as a member of the Jordanian parliament from 1967 to 1988, and as Minister of Health in 1957 and in 1964. Among his many other responsibilities he took over direction of Musa Alami's Arab Development Society in Jericho, which took boys out of Palestinian refugee camps to teach them agricultural and other skills. In 1947 he married Betty Dagher from Lebanon, who is now director of the Princess Basma Centre for Disabled Children in Jerusalem.

The original Hawkgirl, Shiera Sanders Hall, was created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Dennis Neville, and first appeared in Flash Comics #1 (January 1940). Shayera Hol was created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Joe Kubert, and first appeared in The Brave and the Bold #34 (March 1961). Kendra Saunders was created by writer David S. Goyer and artist Stephen Sadowski, and first appeared in JSA: Secret Files and Origins #1 (August 1999). One of DC's earliest super-heroines, Hawkgirl has appeared in many of the company's flagship team-up titles including Justice Society of America and Justice League of America. Several incarnations of Hawkgirl have appeared in DC Comics, all of them characterized by the use of archaic weaponry and artificial wings, attached to a harness made from the special Nth metal that allows flight. Most incarnations of Hawkgirl work closely with a partner/romantic interest Hawkman. Since DC's continuity was rewritten in the 1985 series Crisis on Infinite Earths, Hawkgirl history has become muddled with several new versions of the character appearing throughout the years, some associated with ancient Egypt and some with the fictional planet Thanagar. These versions of the character have starred in several series of various durations. Hawkgirl has been adapted into various media, including direct-to-video animated films, video games, and both live-action and animated television series, featuring as a main or recurring character in the shows Justice League Animated, Justice League Unlimited, The Flash, Arrow, Young Justice, DC Super Hero Girls and DC's Legends of Tomorrow. Ciara Ren√©e portrayed the character in live action in the Arrowverse shows. Publication history Golden Age Created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Dennis Neville, Shiera Sanders first appeared in Flash Comics #1 (January 1940), in the same 12-page story in which Fox and Neville introduced Hawkman.Flash Comics #1 at the Grand Comics Database Shiera first appears as Hawkgirl in All Star Comics #5 (July 1941), in a costume created by Sheldon Moldoff,Hawkgirl at the Grand Comics Database based on Neville's Hawkman costume. Silver Age With the fading popularity of superheroes during the late 1940s, the Hawkman feature ended in the last issue of Flash Comics in 1949. In 1956, DC Comics resurrected the Flash by revamping the character with a new identity and backstory. Following the success of the new Flash, DC Comics revamped Hawkman in a similar fashion with The Brave and the Bold #34 in 1961. The Silver Age versions of Hawkman and Hawkgirl became married alien police officers from the planet Thanagar who come to Earth in order to study police techniques. Silver Age Hawkgirl is introduced as Shayera Hol (phonetically identical to Shiera Hall), who appears in costume as of her first appearance. Although Silver Age Hawkman joins the Justice League in Justice League of America #31 in 1964, Silver Age Hawkgirl was not offered membership because Justice League rules only allowed for one new member to be admitted at a time. In 1981, Silver Age Hawkgirl changed her name to Hawkwoman in the Hawkman backup feature of World's Finest Comics #274. With the establishment of DC's multiverse system, the Golden Age Hawkgirl was said to have lived on Earth-Two and the Silver Age Hawkgirl on Earth-One. Post-Crisis and One Year Later Following the events of DC's miniseries, Crisis on Infinite Earths, the histories of Earth-One, Two, Four, S, and X were merged into one single Earth with a consistent past, present, and future. As a result, both the Golden Age and the Silver Age versions of Hawkman and Hawkgirl live on the same Earth. Shortly after Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC decided that having the Justice Society on the same Earth as all of the other superheroes was redundant and most of the team, including Golden Age Hawkman and Hawkgirl were given a sendoff in the Last Days of the Justice Society one-shot. The Justice Society were trapped in another dimension, Limbo, where they would battle for all of eternity to prevent Ragnar√∂k from occurring on the Earth. Initially, the Silver Age Hawkman and Hawkwoman were kept in continuity unchanged after Crisis on Infinite Earths. However, DC reversed this decision and rebooted Hawkman continuity after the success of the Hawkworld miniseries. Originally, Hawkworld was a miniseries set in the past that revised the origins of Hawkman and Hawkwoman, but after the series became a success, DC Comics made Hawkworld an ongoing series set in the present, with both heroes only recently appearing on Earth after the events in the Invasion! miniseries, resulting in a complete reboot of Hawkman continuity. Several continuity errors regarding Hawkman and Hawkgirl's Justice League appearances then needed to be fixed, including their appearance in the Invasion! miniseries. All previous appearances by the Silver Age Hawkgirl in the Justice League were explained by the Golden Age Hawkgirl taking the Silver Age Hawkgirl's place. However, Hawkwoman continued to appear in some pre-Hawkworld Justice League adventures during the time Golden Age Hawkgirl was trapped in Limbo. To explain this continuity error, a new Hawkwoman, Sharon Parker, was created and retconned into the Justice League during the time Golden Age Hawkgirl was in Limbo. After the Hawkworld reboot, Hawkgirl (Hawkwoman) was now Shayera Thal and not married to Katar Hol, instead merely his police partner. In post-Hawkworld continuity, Shayera adopts the name Hawkwoman from the very beginning of her costumed career and never uses the name Hawkgirl. The Golden Age Hawkgirl is eventually returned from Limbo, but during the Zero Hour miniseries she is merged with Katar Hol and Golden Age Hawkman into a new persona. A new Hawkgirl was introduced as part of the 1999 revival of the JSA monthly title. The new Hawkgirl is Kendra Saunders, granddaughter of the Golden Age Hawkgirl's cousin, Speed Saunders. Hawkgirl would continue to appear regularly in the monthly JSA series and later in the Hawkman monthly. In 2006, the ongoing Hawkman monthly series was retitled Hawkgirl starting with issue #50 as part of the \\"One Year Later\\" jump forward; Kendra replaced Hawkman as the lead character. The Hawkgirl comic book series was finished with issue #66. Fictional character biographies  Shiera Sanders Hall The Golden Age Hawkgirl was Shiera Sanders Hall, the reincarnation of the Egyptian princess Chay-Ara, and partner of Carter Hall, the Golden Age Hawkman. Shayera Hol Kendra Saunders Kendra Saunders was a young Hispanic woman who committed suicide. When Kendra's soul left her body, that of her grandfather's first cousin Shiera Hall, the Golden Age Hawkgirl entered it, making Kendra a walk-in. Her grandfather, former OSS agent and globe-trotting adventurer Speed Saunders, recognized this, in part due to a change in eye color, and encouraged his granddaughter to embrace her destiny as the \\"new\\" Hawkgirl. Powers and abilities Hawkgirl owes her powers to a belt of Nth metal, a substance native to the planet Thanagar (once home of another pair of Hawk-heroes, Katar Hol and Hawkwoman). The metal is psycho-reactive, responding to its bearer's thoughts and in its base form has a number of electromagnetic/gravitational properties. To the Hawks, it grants the power of flight, superhuman strength, super-acute vision, and an enhanced healing/regeneration ability. Additionally, she displays advanced hand-to-hand combat skills. Like Hawkman, she retains the knowledge of several lifetimes worth of fighting. Her preferred weapons are a spear or mace, but she has also been depicted using swords, axes, warhammers, shields, and other melee weapons. She possesses shooting skills from her times as the gunfighter, Cinnamon. In addition, the Nth metal knife which murdered Hawkgirl in her original incarnation as Chay-Ara had an unusual effect upon her soul and that of her lover Khufu (Hawkman). The pair are locked in a seemingly endless cycle of death and rebirth throughout the centuries. While not a superhuman power per se, this propensity for reincarnation has allowed Hawkgirl to cheat death and return to active duty in her current incarnation. Like all modern Thanagarians, Shayera Hol has a pair of wings growing from her back which allows her to fly. As a Thanagarian, she has considerable physical strength, endurance and durability. As a former member of the Thanagarian military, she had extensive training in tactics, military science, and personal combat skills. Additionally, her focus in espionage can make her a difficult opponent to track, and provides her with an advantage when tracking villains. Hawkgirl carries a mace made of Nth metal, which can generate electric currents and repel magical energies, her mace is highly effective against magic, as shown when Hawkgirl defeated Doctor Fate, a powerful magician of the DC Universe. Hawkgirl is skilled at wielding and throwing the mace accurately. She has creatively used the mace as a shield to deflect incoming projectiles as well as a makeshift defibrillator unit. Hawkgirl is fluent in many Earth languages, through the use of the Absorbascon. Her unique Thanagarian physiology also enables her to verbally communicate with birds.Hawkman vol. 1 #3 (August 1964) The Nth metal also regulates the body temperature of the wearer, preventing the need for heavy protective clothing while in high altitudes. It also has the property of radiating heat, which can be controlled to warm the wearer in colder climates.Flash Comics #18 (June 1941). Recently, Kendra has discovered that she had enhanced healing, strength, vision and limited hover abilities when not wearing Nth metal. She speculates that this is due to her prolonged exposure to the substance. It remains to be seen if she still possesses these abilities now that she is Shiera Hall once again.HawkGirl #58 (January 2007) Other versions Flashpoint In the alternate timeline of the Flashpoint event, Hawkgirl joined with the Amazons' Furies.Flashpoint: Wonder Woman and the Furies #2 (July 2011) Later, Hawkgirl is seen aiding Artemis in her attempt to kill the Resistance movement member, Lois Lane.Flashpoint: Lois Lane and the Resistance #1 (June 2011) Although, Lois is rescued by Resistance member Penny Black using the smoke grenades, Penny is seriously wounded.

After being informed of the situation, the kidnapping of Superman's parents at the hands of Mirror Master, she is one of the many heroes to agree to help locate the Rogue. She battles Weather Wizard in Central City, and is later seen waiting outside the villain's bar. Hawkgirl next appears to help Wonder Woman battle the attacking Atlanteans and Aquaman. Hawkgirl battles the forces of Atlantis as Wonder Woman orders her to rescue the people who had been knocked off the boat by Aquaman's attack. She watches Arthur's forces suddenly retreat and notices the massive tsunami fast approaching. She is the first to realize there is something behind the wave. Hawkgirl spots what she believes are mountains rising out of the water, but are in fact the massive tentacles of the Kraken Aquaman called to his aid. Hawkgirl is ensnared by one of the Kraken's tentacles and dragged underwater, slowly drowning while Wonder Woman struggles to save her. After Superman arrives and forces Aquaman to call his beast off, Hawkgirl is ordered by the Man of Steel to help the sailors while Superman and the League go to give their response to Aquaman's ultimatum. Hawkgirl removes the leader of a country from his limousine during a parade before she loses him to Captain Atom. Shocked, Shiera lets her guard down and is struck by a blast of electricity, causing her to fall to the streets below. Collapsed, Hawkgirl sees Black Lightning and Huntress before the latter knocks her unconscious with an arrow bolt. Hawkgirl is later seen being held in a cell in the Batcave, glaring at Batman and Catwoman as they discuss the League's reaction to her kidnapping. When Catwoman points out the League will be searching for her, Batman disagrees and the scene cuts to the Watchtower, where to many heroes shock, a second Hawkgirl is seen arriving. The true Hawkgirl has remained trapped within the Batcave while her imposter has been revealed as the Martian Manhunter, shape-shifted into her form. Exactly a week later, the Martian Manhunter is exposed thanks to Batman's son Damian, and Bruce releases Hawkgirl as promised. Shiera makes her way to the crashed Watchtower and confirms her identity by easily putting out a lit match. Hawkgirl goes to the Hall of Justice to question Lex Luthor over whether Sinestro truly willingly gave up his ring and powers before allowing himself to be imprisoned. Luthor confirms her questions before saying he still believes Sinestro has something else to play before Sinestro responds that the Green Lanterns will soon arrive to capture Superman and that the League will need his help to stop them. Hawkgirl is next seen waiting for Superman and Shazam in Utah at the Great Salt desert, mace at the ready as she answers Shazam's question of what the Man of Steel thinks they're dealing with by replying \\"He thinks we're dealing with Green Lanterns.\\" When Superman asks how she knows, she tells him she was talking with their 'guest' at the Hall of Justice. When she sees Superman staring up into the sky, she asks how many Lanterns are on the way, with Superman replying, \\"Too many.\\" After the Green Lanterns arrive in front of them and Superman and Kilowog have a brief conversation, Shiera demands to know where Hal Jordan is, and when Kilowog doesn't respond, Superman has Cyborg fire a beam down on the Green Lanterns from the Watchtower. The Green Lanterns survive and engage the three, with Hawkgirl fighting the Green Lanterns Isamot Kol and RRU-9-2, when she sees Superman suddenly go down, calling out his name. Shortly after, Hawkgirl is defeated, her Nth Metal mace taken by Green Lantern Tomar-Re, and her unconscious body trapped in a bubble construct alongside Shazam. Before any of them can be taken to Oa, Sinestro arrives, killing Ch'p. Shiera is freed and recovers her mace before engaging Tomar-Re and Procanon Kaa in a battle until the arrival of the Sinestro Corps. Hawkgirl flies above the captured Green Lanterns, silently observing as they remove their rings in surrender and she witnesses the Sinestro Corps depart the Earth on Sinestro's orders. During the lost seven months, Hawkgirl worked alongside fellow League members Superman and Shazam as well as Lanterns Hal, John and Sinestro in toppling more 'rogue nations' to continue establishing peace across the world. When Hawkman returns to Thanagar and does not find Hawkgirl he goes to Earth. There he tries to force Hawkgirl to leave Superman's Regime and return home, but, loyal to Superman, Shayera fights against Hawkman; after defeating him she asks him to leave or she will kill him.

After that Stewart began something with fellow leaguer Vixen; however, during a trip to the future John Stewart met Warhawk, who called him \\"Dad\\".

Although this mini-series was never labelled as an Elseworlds project when originally published, it is now accepted as being one, with this story clearly based on the Silver Age versions of Hawkman and Hawkgirl during the pre-Crisis on Infinite Earths era. Legend of the Hawkman Hawkgirl (Shayera Hol) and Hawkman feature in this mini-series set soon after their arrival on Earth as the duo faces an ancient menace with connections to their Thanagarian heritage. In the first chapter, \\"The Fallen One\\", Shayera has been anxious to return to Thanagar, but Katar feels a responsibility to the museum, especially its upcoming extraterrestrial treasure exhibit. While Katar has adopted Earth as his home Shayera doesn't feel like they belong there. In Tibet a group of archaeologists discovers a Thanagarian gateway carved into a cliff side, after being informed of this Hawkgirl and Hawkman travel to the location.Legend of the Hawkman #1 (July 2000) Hawkman deciphers the writing on the gateway and it depicts the life of Thasaro, a Thanagarian child so evil that he threatened the existence of Thanagar's ancient gods. The ancient gods of Aerie condemned Thasaro into a mystic urn. Shayera's ancestor was entrusted with burying the urn so no one could release Thasaro. The archeologists and Katar want to examine the gateway but Shayera insists that the gateway be left alone. Hawkman and Shayera get into a fight until Shayera flies away heartbroken because Katar cares more about archeology than her feelings. Katar's fingerprints genetically opens the gateway.

The urn is then transported to the Midway City Museum so Katar and Shayera can safeguard it.Legend of the Hawkman #2 (August 2000) Three months later Shayera is shown wanting to start a family, in the meantime Thanagarian zealots return to Earth to free the heinous fallen god.

Shayera Hol is featured in the comic, this version of Hawkgirl is really similar to the one introduced in the television show, as the comics serves as a spin-off of the series, with Hawkgirl being one of the founding members of the Justice League. JLA: The Nail & JLA: Another Nail In JLA: The Nail and JLA: Another Nail, Hawkgirl is a member of a Justice League, and remains so even after her husband's death by Amazo, although the team faces anti-alien prejudice and suspicion.

In Another Nail, she appears to be close friends with Zatanna. She has forgiven Oliver Queen (in Amazo's body) after he admits feeling responsible for getting Katar killed, Queen believing that his attempts to prove himself caused Hawkman to put himself in danger to project the more vulnerable Oliver. Her role as the sole Hawk with League membership is much like her animated counterpart in the Justice League animated series.

It forms part of the boundary between Serbia (to the south) and Romania (north). In the broad sense it encompasses a route of ; in the narrow sense it only encompasses the last barrier on this route, just beyond the Romanian city of Or»ôova, that contains two hydroelectric dams, with two power stations, Iron Gate I Hydroelectric Power Station and Iron Gate II Hydroelectric Power Station. At this point in the Danube, the river separates the southern Carpathian Mountains from the northwestern foothills of the Balkan Mountains. The Romanian side of the gorge constitutes the Iron Gates Natural Park, whereas the Serbian part constitutes the ƒêerdap National Park. A wider protected area on the Serbian side was declared the UNESCO global geopark in July 2020. Archaeologists have named the Iron Gates mesolithic culture, of the central Danube region circa 13,000 to 5,000 years ago, after the gorge. One of the most important archaeological sites in Serbia and Europe is Lepenski Vir, the oldest planned settlement in Europe, located on the banks of the Danube in the Iron Gate gorge.  Toponymy  Kazan gorge at its narrowest point In English, the gorge is known as Iron Gates or Iron Gate. An 1853 article about the Danube in The Times of London referred to it as \\"the Iron Gate, or the Gate of Trajan.\\"\\"The Seat of War on the Danube,\\" The Times, December 29, page 8 In languages of the region including Romanian, Hungarian, Polish, Slovak, Czech, German, and Bulgarian, names literally meaning \\"Iron Gates\\" are used to name the entire range of gorges. These names are (), , , , , and ≈Ωelezni vrata. An alternative Romanian name for the last part of the route is Defileul DunƒÉrii, literally \\"Danube Gorge\\". In Serbian, the gorge is known as ƒêerdap (–Ç–µ—Ä–¥–∞–ø; ), with the last part named ƒêerdapska klisura (–Ç–µ—Ä–¥–∞–ø—Å–∫–∞ –∫–ª–∏—Å—É—Ä–∞; , meaning ƒêerdap Gorge) from the Byzantine Greek ŒöŒªŒµŒπœÉŒøœçœÅŒ± (kleisoura), \\"enclosure\\" or \\"pass.\\" Both ƒêerdap and former Serbian name for it, Demir-kapija, are Turkish in origin. Demir- kapija means \\"iron gate\\" (demirkapƒ±) and a translation of it entered most of the other languages as the name of the gorge, while ƒëerdap comes from girdap which means whirlpool, vortex.  Natural physical features   Gorges  The Roman plaque \\"Tabula Traiana\\", Serbia The first narrowing of the Danube lies beyond the Romanian isle of Moldova Veche and is known as the Golubac gorge. It is 14.5 km long and wide at the narrowest point. At its head, there is a medieval fort at Golubac, on the Serbian bank. Through the valley of Ljupovska lies the second gorge, Gospodjin Vir, which is 15 km long and narrows to . The cliffs scale to 500 m and are the most difficult to reach here from land. The broader Donji Milanovac forms the connection with the Great and the Small Kazan gorge, which have a combined length of . The Or»ôova valley is the last broad section before the river reaches the plains of Wallachia at the last gorge, the Sip gorge. left The Great Kazan (kazan meaning \\"cauldron\\" or \\"reservoir\\") is the most famous and the most narrow gorge of the whole route: the river here narrows to 150 m and reaches a depth of up to .  Navigation and channels  250px The riverbed rocks and the associated rapids made the gorge valley an infamous passage for shipping, even for the most seasoned boatmen. During the period of the Ottoman rule, the ships were guided through by the local navigators, familiar with the routes, called kalauz (from Turkish kalavuz, meaning guide, travel leader). During the rule of prince Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá, local Serbs gradually took over from the Ottomans, being officially appointed by the prince. In order not to aggravate the Ottomans further, the prince named Serbian navigators by a Turkish name, dumend≈æiba≈°a, from d√ºmen (rudder) and ba≈ü (head, chief, master). The navigation fee was divided among dumend≈æiba≈°a, loc (river pilots) and regional municipalities. In German, the passage is still known as the Kataraktenstrecke, even though the cataracts are gone. Near the actual \\"Iron Gates\\" strait the Prigrada rock was the most important obstacle (until 1896): the river widened considerably here and the water level was consequently low. Upstream, the Greben rock near the \\"Kazan\\" gorge was notorious. Some of the channels created included: * Stenka, long, with 10 navigational signals (originally, the balloons were used) * Izlaz-Tahatlija, , with 7 signals * Svini»õa, , with 4 signals * Juc, , with 5 signals * Sip, * Mali ƒêerdap, , as an extension of Sip Channel In total, of navigable channels was created. They were flooded when the artificial Lake ƒêerdap was created (early 1970s). The results of these efforts were slightly disappointing. The currents in the Sip Channel were so strong at 15kts (8 m/s) that until 1973, ships had to be dragged upstream along the canal by locomotive. The Iron Gates thus remained an obstacle of note.  Dams  Iron Gate I dam Hydropower site Iron Gates (1970) The construction of the joint Romanian-Yugoslavian mega project commenced in 1964. In 1972 the Iron Gate I Dam was opened, followed by Iron Gate II Dam, in 1984, along with two hydroelectric power stations, two sluices and navigation locks for shipping. The construction of these dams gave the valley of the Danube below Belgrade the nature of a reservoir, and additionally caused a 35 m rise in the water level of the river near the dam. The old Or»ôova, the Danube island of Ada Kaleh (below) and at least five other villages, totaling a population of 17,000, had to make way. People were relocated and the settlements have been lost forever to the Danube. When designed and built without adequate attention to the natural functioning of a river, dams have the effect of cutting a river into ecologically isolated compartments, which do not allow free movement and migration of species. Migratory fish are particularly badly hit, being rendered unable to move upstream or downstream between their spawning grounds and areas used at other times in their life cycle. The construction of the Iron Gates had a major impact on the local fauna and flora as well--for example, the spawning routes of several species of sturgeon were permanently interrupted. Beluga sturgeon was the largest, and the largest specimen was recorded in 1793, at . There have also been significant regional economic impacts ‚Äì notably on the productivity of Danube fisheries. The status of the Danube‚Äôs migratory fish species is a strong indicator of the ecological health of the entire Danube River Basin, which in turn has wider economic and strategic consequences. The flora and fauna, as well as the geomorphological, archaeological and cultural historical artifacts of the Iron Gates have been under the protection of both nations since the construction of the dam. In Serbia this was done with the ƒêerdap National Park (since 1974, ) and in Romania by the Por»õile de Fier National Park (since 2001, ).  History   Prehistoric and Roman era  Sandstone statues dated to the early Neolithic era indicate that the area has been inhabited for a very long time. Even more significant are the Iron Gates Mesolithic (c. 13,000 to 5,000 BP) sites ‚Äì in particular, the gorge of Gospodjin Vir, which contains the major archaeological site of Lepenski Vir (unearthed in the 1960s). Lepenski Vir is often regarded as the most important Mesolithic site in south-east Europe. East of the Great Kazan the Roman emperor Trajan built the legendary bridge erected by Apollodorus of Damascus. Construction of the bridge ran from 103 through 105, preceding Trajan's final conquest of Dacia. (On the right (Serbian) bank a Roman plaque commemorates him. On the Romanian bank, at the Small Kazan, a likeness of Decebalus, Trajan's Dacian opponent, was carved in rock in 1994‚Äì2004.)  Ada Kaleh  Ada Kaleh in the 19th century Perhaps the most evocative consequence of the ƒêerdap dam's construction was the flooding of an islet named Ada Kaleh. A former Turkish exclave, it had a mosque and a thousand twisting alleys, and was known as a free port and smuggler's nest. Many other ethnic groups lived there beside Turks. The island was about downstream from Or»ôova and measured 1.7 by 0.4-0.5 km. It was walled; the Austrians built a fort there in 1669 to defend it from the Turks, and that fort would remain a bone of contention for the two empires. In 1699 the island came under Turkish control, from 1716 to 1718 it was Austrian, after a four-month siege in 1738 it was Turkish again, followed by the Austrians reconquering it in 1789, only to have to yield it to the Turks in the following peace treaty. Ada Kaleh in 1912 Thereafter, the island lost its military importance. The 1878 Congress of Berlin forced the Ottoman Empire to retreat far into the south, but the island remained the property of the Turkish sultan, allegedly because the treaty neglected to mention it. The inhabitants enjoyed exemption from taxes and customs and were not conscripted. In 1923, when the Ottoman monarchy had disappeared, the island was given to Romania in the Treaty of Lausanne. The Ada Kaleh mosque dated from 1903 and was built on the site of an earlier Franciscan monastery. The mosque's carpet, a gift from the Turkish sultan Abd√ºlhamid II, has been located in the Constan»õa mosque since 1965. Most Ada Kaleh inhabitants emigrated to Turkey after the evacuation of the island. A smaller part went to Northern Dobruja, another Romanian territory with a Turkish minority.  19th century's Hungarian initiatives  By the early 19th century, freedom of navigation on the Danube was regarded as important by many different states in the region and beyond. Allowing passage through the Iron Gates by larger vessels had become a priority. By 1831 a plan had been drafted to make the passage navigable, at the initiative of Hungarian politician Istv√°n Sz√©chenyi. Not being satisfied with the solutions compiled by the Austrio-Hungarian government and the Austro-Turkish commission, the government of Hungary formed its own commission for the organization of the navigation through the Iron Gates. The project was finished in 1883. Appointed in 1883 and again in 1886, Minister of Trade and Transportation G√°bor Baross, Hungary's \\"Iron Minister\\", presided over modernization projects at Hungary's sea port in Fiume (Rijeka), and regulation of the Upper Danube and Iron Gate. Works on the gorge section were done by the Hungarian Technical Administration over 11 years from 1889. The works were divided in two sectors, the upper and the lower Iron Gates. The channels in the upper section, at the town of Or»ôova (the tripoint between Austria-Hungary, Romania and Serbia at the time) were up to wide and deep, at the zero water level in Or»ôova. In the southern section, the channels were wide and deep, except for the Sip Channel, which was wide. In 1890, near Or»ôova, the last border town of Hungary, rocks were cleared by explosion over a stretch in order to create channels. A spur of the Greben Ridge was removed across a length of over . Here, a depth of sufficed. On 17 September 1896, the Sip Channel thus created (named after the Serbian Sip village on the right bank) was inaugurated by the Austro-Hungarian emperor Franz Joseph, the Romanian king Carol I, and the Serbian king Alexander Obrenovich.

It is an abbreviation of translate or transliterate, indicating its operation of replacing or removing specific characters in its input data set. Overview The utility reads a byte stream from its standard input and writes the result to the standard output. As arguments, it takes two sets of characters (generally of the same length), and replaces occurrences of the characters in the first set with the corresponding elements from the second set. For example, tr 'abcd' 'jkmn' maps all characters a to j, b to k, c to m, and d to n. The character set may be abbreviated by using character ranges. The previous example could be written: tr 'a-d' 'jkmn' In POSIX-compliant versions of \`tr\`, the set represented by a character range depends on the locale's collating order, so it is safer to avoid character ranges in scripts that might be executed in a locale different from that in which they were written. Ranges can often be replaced with POSIX character sets such as [:alpha:]. The \`s\` flag causes \`tr\` to compress sequences of identical adjacent characters in its output to a single token. For example, tr -s ' ' replaces sequences of one or more newline characters with a single newline. The \`d\` flag causes \`tr\` to delete all tokens of the specified set of characters from its input. In this case, only a single character set argument is used. The following command removes carriage return characters. tr -d '\\\\r' The \`c\` flag indicates the complement of the first set of characters. The invocation tr -cd '[:alnum:]' therefore removes all non-alphanumeric characters. Implementations The original version of \`tr\` was written by Douglas McIlroy and was introduced in Version 4 Unix. The version of \`tr\` bundled in GNU coreutils was written by Jim Meyering.https://linux.die.net/man/1/tr The command is also available in the OS-9 shell. A \`tr\` command is also part of ASCII's MSX-DOS2 Tools for MSX- DOS version 2.MSX-DOS2 Tools User's Manual by ASCII Corporation Most versions of \`tr\`, including GNU \`tr\` and classic Unix \`tr\`, operate on single-byte characters and are not Unicode compliant. An exception is the Heirloom Toolchest implementation, which provides basic Unicode support. The command has also been ported to the IBM i operating system. Ruby and Perl also have an internal tr operator, which operates analogously. Tcl's string map command is more general in that it maps strings to strings while tr maps characters to characters.

During this time prior to the Thirty Years' War, there was a nominal peace between the Protestant and Catholic confessions as both competed to establish their faith more firmly with the population of their respective area. This confession-building occurred through \\"social-disciplining,\\" as there was a stricter enforcement by the churches of their particular rules for all aspects of life in both Protestant and Catholic areas. This had the consequence of creating distinctive confessional identities that influenced church dogma, faith formation, liturgy, and the development of universities. The German historian Ernst Walter Zeeden first described the phenomenon of 'confession building' (Konfessionsbildung) in the 1950s. In the 1970s, Wolfgang Reinhard and Heinz Schilling further developed these ideas in parallel, applying their ideas to church-state formation in Roman Catholic and Lutheran contexts in the Holy Roman Empire. Calvin's Geneva is also a model case for the confessional era because of its high degree of social control, unity and homogeneity under one expression of a reformed Christian faith. The Genevan model was informed by an interpretation of Erasmus' humanism. The reformation had shown the independent character of northern Europe to resist acceptance to Catholic orthodoxy and thus called for an end to the Corpus Christianum. The new model sought to establish a decentralized Christian community, rooted in the belief that one's own interpretative theology was correct and sufficient. Confessionalization was supported by monarchs and rulers in general, because after the Reformation had brought control over their territories' churches into their hands, they could exercise more power over their subjects by enforcing strict religious obedience. The main tool for the enforcement of these rules were \\"police- regulations\\". These were behavior-codes for religious, social and economic life to which the common citizen had to oblige under threat of severe punishment. Increasingly, the secular governments (sometimes in cooperation or conflict with the churches they controlled) provided material relief for the poor and needy, and in return the state demanded obedience and increased taxes from its subjects. Thus confessionalization is often described as a development stage towards the centralised absolutist state of the 18th century and the modern welfare state.

The best-known version in Europe and the Americas is the Greek variant created in the 1920s by Nikolaos Tselementes. Many versions have a top layer made of milk-based sauce thickened with egg (custard) or flour (b√©chamel sauce). In Greece, the dish is layered and typically served hot. This is quite different from the versions that continue to be made in Turkey and the Middle East. In Turkey, mussaka consists of thinly sliced and fried eggplant served in a tomato-based meat sauce, warm or at room temperature. In the Arab countries, it is often eaten cold, but occasionally hot as well.  Names and etymology  The English name for moussaka was borrowed from Greek ' () and from other Balkan languages, all borrowed from Ottoman Turkish, which in turn borrŒøwed it from Arabic musaqqa‚Äòa (), literally \\"that which is fed liquid\\".Oxford English Dictionary 3rd ed., March 2003 s.v. (subscription) The word is first attested in English in 1862, written m√πz√†kk√†.  Preparation   Greece  Greek Salad at a taverna in Greece Most versions are based primarily on saut√©ed aubergine (eggplant) and tomato, usually with minced meat, mostly lamb. However, the Greek version includes layers of meat and eggplant topped with a B√©chamel (\\"white\\") sauce, and baked. The modern Greek version was created by the French-trained Greek chef Nikolaos Tselementes in the 1920s.Aglaia Kremezi, \\"Nikolas Tselementes\\", Cooks and Other People, Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery, p. 167: \\"before Tselementes there was no moussaka, as we know it today\\" A standard Tselementes-style recipe has three layers that are separately cooked before being combined for the final baking: a bottom layer of sliced eggplant saut√©ed in olive oil; a middle layer of ground lamb lightly cooked with chopped or pur√©ed tomatoes, onion, garlic, and spices (cinnamon, allspice and black pepper); and a top layer of B√©chamel sauce or savoury custard. The composed dish is then layered into a pan and baked until the top layer is browned. Moussaka is usually served warm, not hot; if cut hot out of the oven, moussaka squares tend to slide apart and consequently the dish needs some resting time to firm up before serving. Reheating, however, does not present the same problem. There are variations on this basic recipe, sometimes with no top sauce, sometimes with other vegetables. Such variants may include, in addition to the eggplant slices, saut√©ed zucchini (courgette) slices, part- fried potato slices, or saut√©ed mushrooms. There is a fast-day (vegan) version in Tselementes' cookbook, which includes neither meat nor dairy products, just vegetables (ground eggplant is used instead of ground meat), tomato sauce, and bread crumbs. Another variant is ' (lit. \\"eggplant, little shoe style\\") which consists of whole small eggplant stuffed with ground meat and topped with b√©chamel and baked.  Other countries of Southeast Europe  North Macedonia In Albania, Bulgaria, the former Yugoslavia, and Romania, potatoes are used instead of eggplant, pork or beef mince, and the top layer is usually milk or yogurt mixed with raw eggs, sometimes with a small amount of flour added. There is also a three-layer version: the bottom layer consists of ground pork and beef, the middle layer of potato slices, and the top layer is typically a custard. Each layer is cooked on its own and layered in a pan and baked until the top is browned. The Romanian version is made usually with potatoes or eggplant or cabbage. The layers start with the vegetable, then the layer of meat (usually pork), then vegetables, until the pot is full. Sometimes bread crumbs are used for toppings, sometimes slices of tomatoes and crushed cheese. The pot is then filled with tomato sauce. There is also a pasta variant, with pasta being used instead of vegetables. The \\"fasting\\" variant, which is vegan, replaces meat with mushrooms or a mix of saut√©ed onions and rice. In the rest of the Balkans, the top layer is often a custard: this is the version introduced in the UK by Elizabeth David's Mediterranean Cookery and where it remains the usual presentation. Grated cheese or bread crumbs are often sprinkled on top.  Levant  In the Levant, moussaka is a cooked dish made up primarily of tomatoes and eggplant, similar to Sicilian caponata, and may also include chickpeas. It may be served cold as a mezze dish, or hot.  Egypt  The Egyptian version of moussaka is made from layers of fried eggplant immersed in tomato sauce and then baked. A layer of seasoned cooked ground beef is usually added between the eggplant before baking. The dish can be served hot but is usually chilled for a day or so to improve the taste.

The band released a self-titled debut EP in 2001, and then three full-length album afterwards; Begins Here in 2003, Imago in 2006, and Final Conversation of Kings in 2008. During this time, the band consisted of Clint Boge on lead vocals, Kurt Goedhart on guitar, Glenn Esmond on bass, and Ben Hall on drums. After struggling for years to work on a fourth studio album, Boge left the band in 2012 due to personal and creative differences. The remaining members recruited Brisbane-based singer Paul Galagher for a final single and tour before announcing their breakup in 2016. In July 2017, the band announced their reunion as well as a headlining tour scheduled to take place in March 2018. History Formation and self-titled EP (1999‚Äì2002) The band first formed in 1999, consisting of drummer Ben Hall, guitarist Kurt Goedhart and a few schoolmates. The band in this form played a few live shows in 1999, most notably one at the Ipswich Racecourse, where Hall met future lead singer Clint Boge after the show. The two discussed musical ideas for what would become the band's first release of music, and by Winter 2000, Boge replaced the band's prior vocalist. The band released their self- titled debut EP in 2001. Two singles were released from the album, \\"Take it Away\\" and \\"Crave\\", both receiving extensive airplay on Australian radio station Triple J. The band toured extensively throughout 2002 in support of the album, with the band recruiting final long-term member Glenn Esmond as a bassist, and then playing the Rapid Festival, the Shihad Tour, and the 2002 edition of the Big Day Out festival. The single's and tour lead to band's EP, an independent release, to exceed over 10,000 copies sold. After being featured as Triple J's \\"Unsigned Find\\" of 2002, the band signed to record labels \\"Roadshow Music\\" and \\"Rough Cut Publishing\\", and began working on a full-length album. Begins Here (2003‚Äì2005) In November 2002 the band released \\"Crave\\", the first single from their debut album. It debuted on the ARIA Charts at No. 59 and also achieved No. 1 on the independent charts. The Butterfly Effect spent November 2002 to March 2003 recording their debut album, Begins Here, at Modern Music Studios in Brisbane, Australia. The album was released in Australia on 4 August 2003. It debuted at No. 24 on the ARIA Charts and again topped the independent charts. It remained in the charts for 56 weeks in total. , it has sold over 30,000 copies. Distribution deals saw the album being released by RSK in the UK, Sony in Germany, Suburban in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The band started to garner attention in Europe, with mentions in media including Metal Hammer, Rock Sound, Classic rock, Kerrang!, Metal Hammer Germany and Aardshock. In August 2004 the band did a six-week tour through Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Czech Republic, the Netherlands and the UK. From September to November The Butterfly Effect played 32 shows in 40 days. Album sales have exceeded 10,000 units in the UK and Europe, and the band has also had some success in South Africa. During 2005 the band recorded a new single titled \\"Phoenix\\" featuring Kenn Malaxos on banjo. It was released in September, and a film clip was also made. During October and November the band toured Australia, playing some material from their forthcoming second album, Imago, which was released in Australia during July 2006. Imago (2006‚Äì2007) The band finished recording their second studio album, titled Imago, in early 2006 and it was released on 17 June 2006. It debuted at No. 2 in the ARIA Chart for Weekly Top 100 highest selling music albums. Their previous album, Begins Here, was released in the US through hard rock record label Megaforce Records. The band commenced the Imago tour around Australia in July. In mid-2006, after nearly three years since its release Begins Here was certified gold in Australia, exceeding sales of 35,000 copies. Shortly afterwards, Imago also attained the same status, only this time it reached the gold mark in only eight weeks, including debuting at No. 2 on the ARIA album charts. Following the release of Imago, The Butterfly Effect spent the remainder of the year touring the record including an appearance on the 2007 Big Day Out festival tour. Shortly after, work began on material for the follow-up album. In July 2007, the band undertook the In A Memory Tour, with Chicago's Chevelle and upcoming Brisbane act Dead Letter Circus. On this tour, they previewed '7 Days' and 'Rain'. In early 2008, the Home Alone Tour was announced to fill in time before the recording of the new record. The tour, previewed additional new songs called \\"The Hidden\\" and \\"In These Hands\\". Final Conversation of Kings (2008‚Äì2009) Recording of the album began in March 2008. The album, Final Conversation of Kings, was released in Australia on 20 September. The cover and booklet art was illustrated by Monaux. It debuted on the ARIA Charts at No. 3\\\\. On 14 July the band's first single Window and the Watcher was debuted on radio station Triple J, with the single being released on 23 August. After the release of the album, The Butterfly Effect set off on a tour of Australia spanning October and November, with support from Melbourne acts Trial Kennedy and Sleep Parade. They also performed as part of the Big Day Out 2009 festival, headlining the Converse Essential stage. Aborted fourth album and breakup (2010‚Äì2016) Initial plans after wrapping up touring in support of Final Conversation of Kings involved writing and demoing material for a fourth album in 2010 and releasing it in early 2011. The band would also tour during this time, performing the \\"Four Wheels and a Heartbeat\\" tour in 2010, where they even played new material, most notably a track entitled \\"Five Golden Rings\\" in full. Despite this, the band would privately struggle to work on the album for over three years. The band went through extended periods of tension and frustration, with members, most notably Boge with the rest of the band, not getting along. Boge desired for the band to return to their heavier, earlier sound of the initial EP and Begins Here album. Conversely, the rest of the band wanted to push forward even further into progressive territory, as they had with Final Conversation of Kings album, and incorporate further unconventional instruments for rock music into their songs, such as mandolin or bells.http://www.spaceshipnews.com.au/interview-butterfly-effect-wheels- heartbeat-tour/ After months of the band struggling with their work on the album or get along with one another, in mid-September 2011, Boge privately announced to the band that he would be leaving. However, with the internal struggles being entirely unknown to the general public at the time, the band kept it secret until February 2012, where, in press release, they announced that Boge had left amicably to pursue other interests. In the meantime, the band participated in a number of \\"Tenth Anniversary\\" concerts through October 2011, where the band felt a large sense of relief, knowing that there was an end to their internal struggles, and being able to focus on playing music rather than create it. This cemented their view on Boge leaving, but also inspired them to do one last tour together; in February 2012, upon announcing Boge's departure, they also announced that they would do a farewell tour, and release a \\"Greatest Hits\\" album, both entitled Effected. The tour ran from April to June 2012. During the time, Boge expanded more on why he left, and the band's turmoil. Boge described resentment of the official press release, stating that calling it \\"amicable\\" was \\"bullshit\\", and that it entirely came down to members not getting along or respecting him. He blamed himself as well, stating: > \\"'If I‚Äôve lost the faith from my bandmates to produce what I think are the > best melodies...' and to have that trust taken away, then I couldn‚Äôt go on > working like that. Not only that, but I don‚Äôt want to be the weak link in a > band. I don‚Äôt want to be the guy that‚Äôs not pulling his weight. That was > another reason, too. I thought, 'If that was the case, I‚Äôve got to go.\\" After the band's farewell tour concluded in June 2012, Boge left the band and worked with his other band, Thousand Needles in Red, while the remaining three members started the search for a new lead singer in order to resume work on a fourth studio album. In August 2013 the band released their DVD Effected, a 2 DVD set featuring a live recording of the Melbourne show of the Effected tour and a documentary outlining the band's career and internal struggles up until that point. The DVD debuted at #1 on the ARIA music DVD chart. In September 2013, the band announced an Australian tour for October, shortly after announcing Paul Galagher as the band's new lead singer. The band released their first and only single with Galagher entitled \\"Eyes Down\\", at the same time. After a second period of years of public silence and inactivity, the band officially announced their disbandment in August 2016. Reunion (2017‚Äìpresent) In July 2017, the band announced the reformation of their original lineup, with Boge again as the lead singer, and announced they would begin touring Australia again in March 2018.

History  Creation International Watch Company - early 20th century example of fob watch IWC Grande Complication In 1868, American engineer and watchmaker Florentine Ariosto Jones (1841‚Äì1916),Watch-Wiki: Florentine Ariosto Jones who had been a director of E. Howard & Co., in Boston, then America's leading watchmaking company, founded the International Watch Company with the intention of combining Swiss craftsmanship with the modern engineering technology from the U.S. to manufacture watch movements and other watch parts for the American market.\\"Watches from IWC, at page 9. At the time, wages in Switzerland were relatively low although there was a ready supply of skilled watchmaking labor, mainly carried out by people in their homes. Jones encountered opposition to his plans in French-speaking Switzerland because Jones wanted to open a factory. In 1850 the town of Schaffhausen was in danger of being left behind in the Industrial Age. At this stage, watch manufacturer and industrialist Heinrich Moser built Schaffhausen's first hydroelectric plant and laid the cornerstone for future industrialization.Watches from IWC, at page 10. He probably met F.A. Jones in Le Locle and showed great interest in his plans. Together, they laid the foundations for the only watch manufacturers in north-eastern Switzerland: The International Watch Company in Schaffhausen. Prior to adopting the name International Watch Company, the brand was known as the International Watch Chronology. It is still recognized by this name today by watch connoisseurs and horologists. Early stages IWC factory in Schaffhausen. In 1869 F.A. Jones rented the first factory premises in an industrial building owned by J.H. Moser at the Rheinstrasse. Very soon he had to rent further rooms in the Oberhaus, one of the oldest buildings in Schaffhausen. By 1874 plans were already being made for a new factory and a site was purchased from Moser's hydroelectric company which was directly adjacent to the banks of the Rhine and called the Baumgarten. Schaffhausen architect G. Meyer won the order to design and build the factory. A year later, in the spring of 1875, the construction work was completed. At first, 196 people worked in the 45 meter long factory, which could accommodate up to 300 workplaces. IWC and the Rauschenbach family The Portuguese series of watches Johann Rauschenbach-Vogel, Chief Executive Officer and a machine manufacturer from Schaffhausen, took over the Internationale Uhrenfabrik on 17 February 1880. Four generations of the Rauschenbach family owned IWC, with varying names. Only a year after the sale, Johannes Rauschenbach died. His son, Johannes Rauschenbach-Schenk, was 25 years old when he took over the Uhrenfabrik von J. Rauschenbach and ran it successfully until his own death on 2 March 1905. Another significant role on the way to the company's success was played by Urs Haenggi from Nunningen in the canton of Solothurn. He had got to know the watch business in French-speaking Switzerland and France; in 1883 he joined IWC and stayed with the company for 52 years. He was responsible for getting factory operations up and running smoothly and acquiring new customers. He was also responsible for warding off the prospect of the outside interests acquiring IWC \\"in the interest of the noble Rauschenbach family\\". After the death of J. Rauschenbach-Schenk in 1905, his wife, two daughters and their husbands, Ernst Jakob Homberger (director of G. Fischer AG in Schaffhausen) and Carl Gustav Jung, took over the watch factory as an open trading company named as the Uhrenfabrik von J. Rauschenbach's Erben - watch manufacturer of the heirs of J. Rauschenbach. E.J. Homberger was the only authorized signatory, Haenggi and Vogel were directors. Following the death of his father-in-law, Ernst Jakob Homberger had a considerable influence on the Schaffhausen watchmaking company's affairs and guided it through one of the most turbulent epochs in Europe's history. Just before the world economic crisis, he took over as sole proprietor and renamed the company Uhrenfabrik von Ernst Homberger-Rauschenbach, formerly International Watch Co. His contribution was honoured in 1952, when he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of St. Gallen. He died in 1955, aged 85 years. Hans Homberger was the third and last of the Rauschenbach heirs to run the factory as a sole proprietor. He had joined his father's company in 1934 and took control after his death in April 1955. In 1957 he added a new wing to the factory and in the same year set up a modern pension fund for the staff. He bought new machines to meet new demands and continuously brought his production technology up to what were considered the latest standards. He died in 1986 at the age of 77. Prominent technicians Technician Johann Vogel from Wangen an der Aare in Solothurn played an important role as technical director. He designed and developed IWC calibers until 1919. In 1885, IWC manufactured the first digital watch based on a patent granted to an Austrian by the name of Pallweber. It was a simple design, but was unable to replace the traditional analogue display. Electrical era In 1888 electricity began to take over at the watch factory. J. Rauschenbach had a powerline installed which supplied it with electricity. During the first few years the electrical power was probably used only for lighting purposes and the galvanic gold-plating of watch movement parts. Shortly before the turn of the century, the company started converting its production machines to electricity. An electric motor made by Brown, Boveri & Co. from Baden powered the engines in the factory, transmitting the energy via a complicated arrangement of shafts and drive belts in the factory workshops. These were later replaced during the 1930s with individually powered machines. 1900-1960 During the period just before and after the First World War, E.J. Homberger devoted himself to devising and setting up social institutions. He extended the living quarters for factory employees and established a fund for widows and orphans. In 1929, the name of the fund was changed to the J. Rauschenbach Foundation and in 1949 he founded the Watch Company Welfare Foundation. Germany's military buildup of the 1930s brought the demand for precision watches back to Glash√ºtte. From the second half of the thirties to the end of World War II, IWC was one of five watch manufacturers (the others being Stowa, Laco, Wempe and A. Lange & S√∂hne) that built B-Uhren for Germany's air force (Luftwaffe). B-Uhren is an abbreviation of Beobachtungsuhren, literally: observation watches. On 1 April 1944, as a result of an error, Schaffhausen was bombed by the United States Army Air Forces. The watch factory was hit by a bomb which failed to detonate after crashing through the rafters. The flames from incendiaries exploding nearby penetrated the building through the broken windows but were extinguished by the company's own fire brigade. After World War II, IWC was forced to change its focus. All of Eastern Europe had fallen under the Iron Curtain, and the economy of Germany was in shambles. As a result, old contacts and connections with other countries in Europe and the Americas as well as Australia and the Far East were revived and intensified or established. In the mid century, IWC rolled out its famed Caliber 89 movement. This mechanically-wound movement powered IWC models from the 1940s until the early 1990s. It gained a reputation for exceptional accuracy and longevity. Many of the early models are still fully functional. 1970s - present The IWC Da Vinci (Mus√©e International d'Horlogerie, La Chaux-De-Fonds, Switzerland) In the 1970s and 80s, due to the quartz crisis, the Swiss watchmaking industry underwent a phase of far-reaching technological change. The era saw the first use of miniaturized electric batteries as a source of energy for wristwatches and some eventually unsuccessful technologies, such as the electronically controlled balance. The Uhrenfabrik H. E. Homberger co-founded and was a shareholder in the Centre √âlectronique Horloger (CEH) in Neuch√¢tel and was financially involved in the development of the Beta 21 quartz wristwatch movement, which was first presented to the public at the 1969 Industrial Fair in Basel and used by other manufactures such as the Omega Electroquartz watches. In value terms, this movement accounted for about 5-6% of total sales of quartz watches. Parallel to this, the company expanded its collection of jeweller watches to include ladies watches with mechanical movements. 1973 was IWC's most successful year of the post-war period. The cataclysmic rise in gold prices in 1974 had grave consequences for the watch exporting industry. Between 1970 and 1974 the price of gold rose from 4,850 to 18,000 francs and the value of the US dollar against the Swiss currency plummeted by up to 40%. As a result, the price of watch exports rose by as much as 250%. At the same time Japan was flooding the market with cheap quartz watches. A change of direction was necessary, and this led to the adoption of a number of measures. In order to survive, IWC, under the leadership of Director and CEO Otto Heller, built up a line of high-quality pocket watches, and, apart from setting up its own modern wristwatch and case manufacturing facilities, began working closely with Ferdinand A. Porsche as an external designer. In addition, IWC pioneered new watchmaking technologies, notably the first titanium bracelets, developed in 1978. For its new plans, IWC required a high level of venture capital. With the help of the Swiss Bank Corporation, the company was put in contact with VDO Adolf Schindling AG, which took a majority interest in IWC in 1978. The IWC GST (Ref. 3707) At the same time, IWC reacquired the name it had originally been given by its founder F.A. Jones (International Watch Co. AG). In 1981, Kawal Singh succeeded H.E. Homberger as general manager following the latter's retirement on age grounds. The new director, G√ºnter Bl√ºmlein, pushed for rapid implementation of planned changes, put the existing advertising campaign to work, built up the customer base, and solidified IWC's finances. In 1985 IWC then Director G√ºnter Bl√ºmlein asked Kurt Klaus to create a Grande Complication watch to be worn on a wrist, as existing iterations on the market are all much larger sized Pocket Watch. In 1986, Manufacture d'Horlogerie Renaud et Papi SA's founders Dominic Renaud and Giulio Papi assisted the design of the repeater function of the movementhttps://www.iwc.com/it/en/forum/the-unveiling-of-a-masterpiece-of- complication.html, before their take over by Audemars Piguet in 1992https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/interview-giulio-papi-director-audemars- piguet-renaud-papi. The IWC ref.3770 launched in 1990 was the first wristwatch-sized Grande Complication that housed a Chronograph, a Minute Repeater and a Perpetual Calendar functionshttps://www.iwc.com/it/en/forum/the-unveiling-of-a-masterpiece-of- complication.html. In 1991 IWC director G√ºnter Bl√ºmlein founded the LMH Group with its headquarters in Schaffhausen. With a 100% stake in IWC, 60% in Jaeger-LeCoultre (the other 40% was owned by Audemars Piguet), and 90% in the Saxony-based watchmaking company of A. Lange & S√∂hne. The Group employed some 1,440 persons. In July 2000, LMH was acquired by Richemont, a Zug-based luxury goods behemoth, for CHF 2.8 billion. Despite the takeover by Richemont, IWC was guaranteed that it would continue to be managed by the same executives from the LMH Group. In 2001 IWC went online with the Collectors Forum. In 2011, IWC released its other Grande Complication watch, Sid√©rale Scafusia, which took 10 years to develop and is one of the most complicated wristwatches in the world.https://luxurywatchbuyer.com/top-10-most-complicated-wrist- watches-by-luxury-watch-buyer/.

The motto was established in 1903.Watches from IWC, page 11; 227, n. 3. Watch manufacturing Production records The Big Pilot Saint Exup√©ry edition. The company began keeping detailed records for each watch that has left the factory since 1885. Since 1885, details of the caliber, materials used and cases have been entered into the records. In the case of later models, these also include the reference number, delivery date and the name of the authorized dealer. For a small fee, the owner can obtain precise information about their watch, as long as the watch is at least ten years old.Watches from IWC, at page 246. The company claims that its service department has the parts and is capable of repairing and maintaining watches from every era since IWC's foundation in 1868.Watches from IWC, at page 249. IWC movements Manufacture in-house movements include the Caliber 50000/52000, Caliber 80000/82000/89000, which use the Pellaton winding system, and the pocket watch movements used in the Portuguese F.A. Jones and other IWC pocket watches. Caliber 59000 is an in-house hand-wound movement which consist of Moonphase or Tourbillon complications. Caliber 94000 consist of IWC's patented Constant Force Tourbillon mechanism. In response to ETA SA's cut in supply of √©bauche movements, IWC developed their new manufacture automatic and chronograph movements, Caliber 32000, Caliber 69000 as in-house designed replacements and are widely used in the Pilot, Portuguese and Ingenieur collections. Richemont Group's Montblanc MB 25.10 movement was also based on IWC's 69370. In the bulk of IWC's lower range watches significant modifications are made to the Sellita SW300 by IWC at the manufacture to create the automatic Caliber 35111.  Environmental rating  Top 5 gold producing nations In December 2018, World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) released an official report giving environmental ratings for 15 major watch manufacturers and jewelers in Switzerland. IWC received a high rating as \\"Ambitious\\" and was ranked No. 1 among the 15 manufacturers. Being the only manufacturer examined to receive such rating, IWC was reported to have shown some \\"serious commitment towards a sustainable transformation, but with substantial potential for improvement\\". Since early 2000s, IWC has been actively engaged in environmental protection and sustainable development. In 2018, IWC became the first Swiss luxury watch brand to publish a sustainability report based on the global best-practice standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). In jewelry and watchmaking industry, there are general concerns over the lack of transparency in manufacturing activities and the sourcing of precious raw materials such as gold, which is a major cause of environmental issues such as pollution, soil degradation and deforestation. The situation is especially serious in the developing countries which are top producers of gold, including China, Russia and South Africa. It is estimated that the watch and jewelry sector uses over 50% of world's annual gold production (over 2,000 tons), but in most cases the watch companies are not able to or are unwilling to demonstrate where their raw materials come from and if the material suppliers use eco-friendly sourcing technologies. Charity auction The IWC Flagship Store in Hong Kong Since 1997, IWC has been offering a unique horological item for online auction annually on its website, donating proceeds to the Ecole des Sables ‚Äì Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry school in Mali.IWC Watches Crown & Caliber The school provides education for Tuareg children. In 2007, the Company auctioned a platinum version of the Pilot's Watch Automatic Edition Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry, Reference 3201.

The village lies on the borders with the Ryedale district of North Yorkshire and with the City of York unitary authority. Location and history The village sits astride an ancient ford on the River Derwent. The Romans established a fort here about 70 AD, around which later developed a large linear civilian settlement focused on a bridge one mile (1.6 km) south of the present town. Iter I of the Antonine Itinerary lists \\"Derventio\\" as being seven Roman miles from Eboracum (York) which matches the distance from York. In relation to known discoveries under the town of Malton, antiquaries always assumed that Malton should be called Derventio. The remains at Stamford Bridge were not known to them, lying undiscovered under arable and pasture fields until quite recently. The Battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September 1066 is the traditional end of the Viking era in Britain. In this battle Harold Godwinson repelled the invading Norwegian force led by his brother Tostig Godwinson and King Harald Hardrada of Norway - but three weeks later his loss at the Battle of Hastings allowed the Norman conquest of England. The settlement was called Pons Belli by the Normans, meaning battle bridge. Rents of freeholders and cottagers were recorded in 1368 and there was a common oven recorded the same year. The A166 east-west road crossing the river at Stamford Bridge is one of the main roads from York to the East Riding and the coast. The road bridge in the village was closed on 5 March 2007, for just over 11 weeks, so that essential repairs could be carried out, in light of the enormous volume of traffic that uses it, exceptional for such an old bridge (dating from 1727). The bridge re-opened on 22 May. In 1882 the population was 449; in the 2011 UK census the parish population was 3,528, an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 3,394. The village suffered from record floods in November 2000 which seriously flooded 30 businesses and homes. Flood defences have now been installed, costing ¬£3.7 million. The history of Stamford Bridge is covered in British History Online: Catton Kexby, Scoreby, and Stamford Bridge West, and Catton High and Low Catton and Stamford Bridge East.  Natural history   Flooding  The River Derwent divides Stamford Bridge into two. It rises in the North York Moors and flows south-west rather than taking a direct route to the North Sea. It eventually joins the River Ouse north of the village of Long Drax, before flowing ultimately into the Humber Estuary. During 4/5 March 1999, exceptional levels of rainfall were experienced in the Derwent catchment area, reaching inside a 24‚Äëhour period. The situation was worsened by melting snow which had earlier accumulated on the North York Moors. Village flood in October 2000 The conditions deteriorated and by Sunday 7 March large areas of Stamford Bridge were under water and a final flooding depth of approximately was recorded by Monday 8 March. At the height of the flooding the River Derwent reach the peak of 5m above its normal level, the highest level ever recorded exceeding the previous highest in 1931 by . However, the following year a new record flood level was set. In October 2000 the Derwent again burst its banks and peaked slightly above the 1999 flood level. Work started in autumn 2003 to build new flood defences for Stamford Bridge and in autumn 2004, work on the defences were finished. The flood defences were breached, and much of the village square was under water, on the morning of 26 June 2007, in the wake of exceptional rainfall over the previous 24 hours. Landmarks Stamford Bridge has several notable landmarks, including the Corn Mill; the stone arched bridge over the River Derwent; the Stamford Bridge Viaduct, and Stamford Bridge railway station, both ; a Wesleyan Methodist Chapel, built 1828 in yellow brick; the Bay Horse Inn, late 18th to early 19th century public house; as well as \\"Derwent Plastics factory\\", on the west side of the river, established in 1934 from a former brewery building; and a memorial commemorating the Battle of Stamford Bridge overlooking the field where the battle is thought to have taken place. Just east of Stamford Bridge is the manor house Burtonfields Hall, built in 1837 by the architect Anthony Salvin for Charles Darley. Darley was married to Salvin's sister-in-law Marianne Nesfield, and their daughter married Anthony Salvin Junior. The original house was extended by W H Brierley in about 1898. The mill The Cornmill is a late 18th to early 19th century Grade II listed water mill. The current mill was possibly expanded in 1847‚Äì50 when nearly ¬£1,000 was spent on it. Subsequently, there were two water wheels and seven pairs of grinding stones. The mill ceased operation in 1964 and was converted into a restaurant in 1967. More recently the Cornmill was converted into twelve two-bedroom apartments but some of the original equipment remains. The bridge The road bridge over the River Derwent There has been a river crossing since at least Roman times. The river upstream of the current bridge was passable except at times of flood via a natural rock ford. There was a bridge at or near the village in the 11th century as one is referred to in accounts of the battle of 1066, noted in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Manuscript 'C'. Archaeological research has shown that there was a bridge crossing of the River Derwent one mile (1.6 km) south of the present village which linked the east and west bank of the Roman settlement of Derventio. In the medieval period a new bridge made of timber supported on three stone piers was erected. Records show that this was repaired in the 13th and 16th centuries. A map from 1724 shows this bridge to have been upstream from the current bridge. In the 18th century the weir and the by-pass canal and lock, known as the New Cut, were built and the medieval bridge was replaced with the current structure. The present bridge was designed by William Etty under an Act of 1725 and completed in 1727. The bridge was strengthened in the 1960s and at the same time the adjacent pedestrian bridge was erected. The bridge is a Grade II* listed monument. The viaduct Opened on 3 October 1847, the viaduct originally carried the York to Beverley railway line across the Derwent, closed 1965. It consists of red brick arches on either side of a single wider wrought-iron span that crosses the river. The viaduct now forms part of a public cycle route, and is Grade II* listed. Governance The parish has a parish council, known as Stamford Bridge Parish Council. It is also within the boundaries of the Pocklington Provincial ward of East Riding of Yorkshire Council, which elects three councillors every four years.  Education  The village school was first built in Main Street in 1795 as a result of a legacy left by Christopher Wharton. Education was provided free for 12 poor boys and 6 poor girls who had to provide one shilling a year for kindling. Pay scholars were also taught and by 1822 the school population numbered 30. 1874 saw compulsory education and in 1911 the East Riding County Council took over and built a school on the present Church Road site. This original building was modernised and extended in 1968 and because of the rapid development of the village a further extension was added in 1978. In April 1983 a new infants building, in Godwinsway, Stamford Bridge, was added to the school. Built for 120 infant children it makes the school a split site establishment, but adds greatly to the educational provision for the children. In 2000 this building was also extended.  Commerce  Even though the car journey from York to the North Sea coast takes just an hour, Stamford Bridge remains a popular stopping point for travellers on the A166. Most stops are for refreshment, usually required due to the long queues to get over the one lane bridge, at one of the establishments located around the Square. The facilities located in central Stamford Bridge include: *Post office and solicitors *Estate agent *Convenience store, a butcher/baker and a pharmacist *Caravan park *Nursing home *Three pubs, the Three Cups, the New Inn (previously known as the Swordsman, but the name was changed back to its original name February 2013) which both provide food and the Bay Horse. *A bistro *A tea room and village shop *An old style sweet shop complete with a Barbers shop in the rear. *Fast food which is served by a pizza/kebab shop, a fish and chip shop, a Chinese restaurant/take-away, Indian restaurant/take- away and a sandwich shop *Modern purpose built veterinary clinic, a dental practice and a doctor's surgery *Two car repair garages *Specialist whisky shop *A shop specialising in eclectic and unusual items. *Hairdressing salon and a beauty/therapy salon. *Florist, which also serves hot drinks. *Funeral director In recent years Stamford Bridge has lost the services of a petrol filling station (once the village had three), ladies clothing shop, HSBC bank, newsagent, Ice Cream parlour, DIY shop, a cafe and hotel which have all closed.  Other facilities  The village has several other facilities available for locals and visitors. *Walks ‚Äì There are well signposted public footpaths along the River Derwent both towards Low Catton (via the Viking Road car park) and Buttercrambe (via the Corn Mill car park). They provide mainly rural picturesque scenery and are unpaved. The route of the White Rose Way, a long distance walk from Leeds to Scarborough also passes through. *Car parking ‚Äì Spaces available in the village square and also a large free public car park is located near the A166 road bridge and Viking Road. *Village hall and scout hall ‚Äì Located on Low Catton Road *Playing Fields Association ‚Äì Located on Low Catton Road.

Public transport The village is served by two bus routes. The number 10 route is operated by First York (and York Pullman in the evenings) with a regular service via Dunnington to the centre of York and then Poppleton. East Yorkshire Motor Services operate an occasional service (No 747) between York and Stamford Bridge continuing to Full Sutton, Fangfoss and Pocklington. Information as at October 2011. Stamford Bridge railway station closed in 1965 as part of the Beeching cuts. The Minsters Rail Campaign is campaigning to re-open the railway line between Beverley and York (with stops at Stamford Bridge, Pocklington and Market Weighton). The proposed re-opened railway would skirt the eastern edge of the village as the former alignment has since been developed.

Types Distinctions are made among various types of law dictionaries. Differentiating factors include: * Number of languages covered: a monolingual law dictionary covers one language, a bilingual covers two. * Number of fields covered: a single-field dictionary covers an entire field of law, whereas a sub-field dictionary covers a part of a field of law, e.g. a dictionary of contract law. Quality A good bilingual law dictionary needs to take the users' expected language and professional competences into account. The lexicographers therefore must consider the following aspects: dictionary user research, dictionary typology, structure, and presentation of the relevant information. When making a law dictionary, the lexicographers attempt to present the information in such a way that the user is not burdened with excessive lexicographic information costs. Functions As pointed out in Nielsen 1994, law dictionaries can serve various functions. The traditional law dictionary with definitions of legal terms serves to help users understand the legal texts they read (a communicative function) or to acquire knowledge about legal matters independent of any text (a cognitive function) ‚Äì such law dictionaries are usually monolingual. Bilingual law dictionaries may also serve a variety of functions. First, they may have entry words in one language and definitions in another language ‚Äì these dictionaries give help to understand legal texts, usually written in a foreign language, and to acquire knowledge, usually about a foreign legal system. Second, bilingual law dictionaries with entry words in one language and equivalents in another language provide help to translate legal texts, into or from a foreign language, and sometimes also to produce legal texts, usually in a foreign language. Formats With the advance of technology, the legal dictionary has made its way onto the Internet and smartphones. Law students and litigants can now look up the meaning of legal terms in seconds.See, e.g., Glossary of legal terms at the New York Courts website. Accessed March 28, 2013. Legal terminology textbook Unlike a law dictionary, which arranges and defines legal words and phrases individually and in alphabetical order, a legal terminology textbook arranges and defines legal words and phrases in groups and by topic. As a result, a student or other person interested in understanding an array of related legal words and phrases may prefer to use a legal terminology textbook instead.

It is unique among the ancient pre-ecumenical councils in that it is considered by Catholics and Orthodox to be a prototype and forerunner of the later ecumenical councils and a key part of Christian ethics. The council decided that Gentile converts to Christianity were not obligated to keep most of the Law of Moses, including the rules concerning circumcision of males. The Council did, however, retain the prohibitions on eating blood, meat containing blood, and meat of animals that were strangled, and on fornication and idolatry, sometimes referred to as the Apostolic Decree or Jerusalem Quadrilateral. Accounts of the council are found in Acts of the Apostles chapter 15 (in two different forms, the Alexandrian and Western versions) and also possibly in Paul's letter to the Galatians chapter 2.Whether or not Galatians 2:1‚Äì10 is a record of the Council of Jerusalem or a different event is not agreed. Paul writes of laying his gospel before the others \\"privately\\", not in a Council. It has been argued that Galatians was written as Paul was on his way to the Council (see Paul the Apostle). Raymond E. Brown in his Introduction to the New Testament argues that they (Acts 15 and Galatians 2) are the same event but each from a different viewpoint with its own bias. Some scholars dispute that Galatians 2 is about the Council of Jerusalem (notably because Galatians 2 describes a private meeting) while other scholars dispute the historical reliability of the Acts of the Apostles. Historical background The Council of Jerusalem is generally dated to 48 AD, roughly 15 to 25 years after the crucifixion of Jesus, between 26 and 36 AD. Acts and Galatians both suggest that the meeting was called to debate whether or not male Gentiles who were converting to become followers of Jesus were required to become circumcised; the rite of circumcision was considered execrable and repulsive during the period of Hellenization of the Eastern Mediterranean, and was especially adversed in Classical civilization both from ancient Greeks and Romans, which instead valued the foreskin positively. At the time, most followers of Jesus (which historians refer to as Jewish Christians) were Jewish by birth and even converts would have considered the early Christians as a part of Judaism. According to scholars, the Jewish Christians affirmed every aspect of the then contemporary Second Temple Judaism with the addition of the belief that Jesus was the Messiah.McGrath, Alister E., Christianity: An Introduction. Blackwell Publishing (2006). . Page 174: \\"In effect, they [Jewish Christians] seemed to regard Christianity as an affirmation of every aspect of contemporary Judaism, with the addition of one extra belief ‚Äî that Jesus was the Messiah.\\" Unless males were circumcised, they could not be God's People. The meeting was called to decide whether circumcision for gentile converts was requisite for community membership since certain individuals were teaching that you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved\\". Circumcision as a mandate was associated with Abraham (see also Abrahamic covenant), but it is cited as \\"the custom of Moses\\" because Moses is considered the traditional giver of the Law as a whole. The circumcision mandate was made more official and binding in the Mosaic Law Covenant. In the words of Jesus are reported to be that Moses gave the people circumcision. Issues and outcome The purpose of the meeting, according to Acts, was to resolve a disagreement in Antioch, which had wider implications than just circumcision, since circumcision is the \\"everlasting\\" sign of the Abrahamic Covenant (). Some of the Pharisees who had become believers insisted that it was \\"needful to circumcise them, and to command [them] to keep the law of Moses\\" (KJV). The primary issue which was addressed related to the requirement of circumcision, as the author of Acts relates, but other important matters arose as well, as the Apostolic Decree indicates. The dispute was between those, such as the followers of the \\"Pillars of the Church\\", led by James, who believed, following his interpretation of the Great Commission, that the church must observe the Torah, i.e. the rules of traditional Judaism, and Paul the Apostle, who believed there was no such necessity. (See also Supersessionism, New Covenant, Antinomianism, Hellenistic Judaism, Paul the Apostle and Judaism.) At the Council, following advice offered by Simon Peter ( and ), Barnabas and Paul gave an account of their ministry among the gentiles (), and the apostle James quoted from the words of the prophet Amos (, quoting ). James added his own wordsGill, J., \\"Acts 15\\". Gill's Exposition of the Whole Bible. Accessed 13 September 2015. to the quotation: \\"Known to God from eternity are all His works\\" and then submitted a proposal, which was accepted by the Church and became known as the Apostolic Decree: sets out the content of the letter written in accordance with James' proposal. The Western version of Acts (see Acts of the Apostles: Manuscripts) adds the negative form of the Golden Rule (\\"and whatever things ye would not have done to yourselves, do not do to another\\"). This determined questions wider than that of circumcision, particularly dietary questions, but also fornication and idolatry and blood, and also the application of Biblical law to non-Jews. It was stated by the Apostles and Elders in the Council: \\"the Holy Spirit and we ourselves have favored adding no further burden to you, except these necessary things, to abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication. If you carefully keep yourselves from these things, you will prosper.\\" (Acts 15:27‚Äì28) And this Apostolic Decree was considered binding on all the other local Christian congregations in other regions.\\"Apostolic Presbyterianism\\" by William Cunningham and Reg Barrow. See also Biblical law directed at non-Jews, Seven Laws of Noah, Biblical law in Christianity, and the Ten Commandments in Christianity. The writer of Acts gives an account of a restatement by James and the elders in Jerusalem of the contents of the letter on the occasion of Paul's final Jerusalem visit, immediately prior to Paul's arrest at the temple, recounting: \\"When we had come to Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly. On the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.\\" (Acts 21:17‚Äì18, ESV) The elders then proceed to notify Paul of what seems to have been a common concern among Jewish believers, that he was teaching Diaspora Jewish converts to Christianity \\"to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or walk according to our customs.\\" They remind the assembly that, \\"as for the Gentiles who have believed, we have sent a letter with our judgment that they should abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality\\". In the view of some scholars, the reminder of James and the elders here is an expression of concern that Paul was not fully teaching the decision of the Jerusalem Council's letter to Gentiles,Robert McQueen Grant Augustus to Constantine: The Rise and triumph of Christianity in the Roman World. Louisville: Westminster John Knox, p. iv. \\"According to Acts 21:25, the elders at Jerusalem were still concerned with observance of them when Paul last \\" particularly in regard to non-strangled kosher meat,Paul Barnett (2004).

Paul delivered the letter from the Jerusalem meeting expressing James's decree, but only to churches in Syria, Cilicia and Galatia ... Paul did not impose the food requirements for the kosher-killed meat and against the idol-sacrificed meat upon the Corinthians\\" which contrasts with Paul's advice to Gentiles in Corinth,1 Corinthians: a new translation Volume 32 Anchor Bible William Fridell Orr, James Arthur Walther ‚Äì 1976 \\"Paul's openness regarding dietary restrictions raises again the question of the connection with the decrees of the council at Jerusalem (Acts 15:29; Introduction, pp. 63‚Äì65).

Cambridge University Press. Bruce Metzger's Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament includes a summary of current research on the topic as of about 1994: Interpreting the Council's decision James's \\"Apostolic Decree\\" was that the requirement of circumcision for males was not obligatory for Gentile converts, possibly in order to make it easier for them to join the movement. However, the Council did retain the prohibitions against Gentile converts eating meat containing blood, or meat of animals not properly slain. It also retained the prohibitions against \\"fornication\\" and \\"idol worship\\". The Decree may have been a major act of differentiation of the Church from its Jewish roots. Jewish Encyclopedia: New Testament ‚Äî Spirit of Jewish Proselytism in Christianity states: Jewish Encyclopedia: Gentiles: Gentiles May Not Be Taught the Torah states: The Catholic Encyclopedia article on Judaizers states: Joseph FitzmyerThe Acts of the Apostles (The Anchor Yale Bible Commentaries), Yale University Press (December 2, 1998), , chapter V disputes the claim that the Apostolic Decree is based on Noahide Law () and instead proposes as the basis, see also Leviticus 18. He also argues that the decision was meant as a practical compromise to help Jewish and Gentile Christians to get along, not a theological statement intended to bind Christians for all time. According to the 19th-century Roman Catholic Bishop Karl Josef von Hefele, the Apostolic Decree of the Jerusalem Council \\"has been obsolete for centuries in the West\\", though it is still recognized and observed by the Greek Orthodox Church.Karl Josef von Hefele's commentary on canon II of Gangra notes: \\"We further see that, at the time of the Synod of Gangra, the rule of the Apostolic Synod with regard to blood and things strangled was still in force. With the Greeks, indeed, it continued always in force as their Euchologies still show. Balsamon also, the well-known commentator on the canons of the Middle Ages, in his commentary on the sixty- third Apostolic Canon, expressly blames the Latins because they had ceased to observe this command. What the Latin Church, however, thought on this subject about the year 400, is shown by St. Augustine in his work Contra Faustum, where he states that the Apostles had given this command in order to unite the heathens and Jews in the one ark of Noah; but that then, when the barrier between Jewish and heathen converts had fallen, this command concerning things strangled and blood had lost its meaning, and was only observed by few. But still, as late as the eighth century, Pope Gregory the Third (731) forbade the eating of blood or things strangled under threat of a penance of forty days. No one will pretend that the disciplinary enactments of any council, even though it be one of the undisputed Ecumenical Synods, can be of greater and more unchanging force than the decree of that first council, held by the Holy Apostles at Jerusalem, and the fact that its decree has been obsolete for centuries in the West is proof that even Ecumenical canons may be of only temporary utility and may be repealed by disuse, like other laws.\\" Acts 28 Hyperdispensationalists, such as the 20th century Anglican E. W. Bullinger, would be another example of a group that believes the decree (and everything before Acts 28) no longer applies.

History Originally a monastery under the Cluniac order, Monk Bretton Priory is located in the village of Lundwood, in the borough of Barnsley, England. It was founded in 1154 as the Priory of St. Mary Magdelene of Lund by Adam Fitswane, sited on the Lund, from Old Norse. In the course of time the priory took the name of the nearby village of Bretton to be commonly known as Monk Bretton Priory. The Notton bequest John de Birthwaite was Prior of Monk Bretton in 1350. In that year Sir William de Notton, a powerful local landowner, who was later Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, and his wife Isabel, conveyed to him lands at Fishlake, Monk Bretton, Moseley and Woolley. The purpose of the grant was to build a chantry chapel at Woolley Church. Notton directed that prayers were to be said for the souls of himself, Isabel, their children, and also King Edward III, Queen Philippa of Hainault and their children. The date of the grant suggests that Notton made the grant as his way of giving thanks for England's deliverance from the first outbreak of the Black Death. Dissolution The monastery closed on 30 November 1538 during the dissolution, and the site passed into the ownership of the Blithman family. In 1580 the land was again sold to George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury who gave the estate to his fourth son Henry on his marriage to Elizabeth Rayner. The site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and now in the care of English Heritage. Excavations concentrating on the church and cloister took place on the site in the 1920s which were published by the Yorkshire Archaeological Society and other largely unrecorded digging by the Ministry of Works took place during the 1950s. More recently the site has been the focus of a survey and excavation project run by Dr Hugh Willmott from the University of Sheffield.

It was produced by Pete Atkin and broadcast in 1995 twice each day‚Äìin the morning and late at night‚Äìon Radio 4. The series comprised 216 episodes, each 12‚Äì14 minutes long, and had a total duration of 46 hours. A 29-hour-long abridged version of the programmes has been issued on CD as part of the BBC Radio Collection. Title The programme's title is a quotation from Act 2, Scene 1 of William Shakespeare's play, King Richard II, attributed to John of Gaunt: > \\"This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle, This earth of majesty, > this seat of Mars ... This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this > England\\". Episodes Beginning in 55 BC with the arrival of Julius Caesar and initially concluding in 1901 with the death of Queen Victoria, the series was read by Anna Massey and included extracts from the book A History of the English-Speaking Peoples written by Sir Winston Churchill, interwoven into Christopher Lee's main account of the history. The extracts were read by Paul Eddington, who died during the production and his role was taken by Peter Jeffrey. In total the series contained 216 episodes, ran 46 hours, and was first broadcast in daily episodes between June 1995 and June 1996. Extensions and spin-offs In 1999 the BBC and Christopher Lee extended the programme to cover the 20th century: from 1901, where the original series had ended, to the end of the millennium. This extension, 15.25 hours long, was broadcast from 30 August to 31 December 1999. The narrator was retained from the original series but quotations were read by Robert Powell. In 2001 another shorter series entitled This Sceptred Isle: Dynasties was produced. This told the stories of the powerful and influential families of Britain and Ireland, including the Godwines, the Despensers and the Churchills. These are the tales of the powerful families who were there before the monarch was, and who were still there long after his or her reign - or even royal dynasty - had come to an end. The series consisted of 10 episodes and was again written by Christopher Lee and narrated by Anna Massey. Over the course of several months in 2005 and 2006 Christopher Lee's This Sceptred Isle: Empire, a 90-part history of the British Empire was broadcast on Radio 4. Each part was 15 minutes long. The narrator was Juliet Stevenson and the cast of readers of various historical documents‚Äìsuch as poems, songs, personal letters, and first-hand accounts‚Äìincluded Jack Davenport, Joss Ackland, Christopher Eccleston, and Anna Massey among others.

Sonora is to the left (south). Sonoyta, Sonora is a town in the northern Mexican state of Sonora. It stands on the U.S.-Mexico border, facing Lukeville, Arizona, in the United States. It is the municipal seat of the municipality of Plutarco El√≠as Calles. Demographics According to the 2010 census, the city had 12,849 inhabitants while the surrounding municipality had 15,652 inhabitants. There were 6,613 male inhabitants and 6,236 female. 96.1 percent of the population over five years of age are Roman Catholic, 3.0 percent are Evangelicals, and the remaining 0.9 percent belong to other religions. History The first inhabitants of this region were the Tohono O'odham, who lived in the regions of Pinacate, Quitovac, and Sonoyta. The arrival of Jesuit missionaries to this zone changed their way of life. Therefore, compact communities were formed mainly on the banks of lakes and of the river. At the foothills of a spot known as Loma Alta, sprouted water from a fountain, called by the naturals ·π¢on Oidag, O'odham for \\"base of the water\\". A missionary community was founded in Sonoyta in 1693 by Father Kino. It was called Nuestra Senora de Loreto y San Marcelo de Sonoyta. In 1836 they discovered adjoining mines. Sonoyta was dependent to the municipality of the District of Altar during periods of the 19th century. After the Revolution it belonged to the municipality of Caborca, Sonora through the Law No. 136 of July 9, 1952. Then it separated from the municipality of Caborca and belonged to the municipality of Puerto Pe√±asco, Sonora until August 1989, when a new municipality was created and called General Plutarco El√≠as Calles, as a social, political, and historic need. For a long time the border crossing was very busy with imports/exports, but after an internal change to customs laws in Mexico, import/export business dwindled. This led to heavy migration to other cities during the late 1980s to mid 1990s. Education The Municipality has 10 preschools, 15 elementary schools, 5 junior high and high schools, 2 medium professional and a 1 accredited college. Traffic Sonoyta is situated at an important crossroads. Federal Highway 2, which runs parallel to the international border, crosses here. Federal Highway 8 leading from Lukeville, Arizona (U.S.-Mexico border of Sonoyta) to Puerto Pe√±asco, Sonora, also crosses the city. Present day Sonoyta is well known as an illegal immigrant crossing- point to the United States. Many migrants use the town to make final preparations for a treacherous trek through the Sonoran Desert. On this long desert march, migrants often face death, especially during the summer season. Conversely, the town is used as a crossover point for American tourists headed to Puerto Pe√±asco, Sonora or other cities in Northern Mexico. Puerto Pe√±asco, a popular beach resort city, is located about southwest on Highway 8. Sonoyta features many urban features, as well as a downtown with many small stores and markets. Services of major companies, such as Pemex, are available, and major airports are located in Mexicali, Baja California; Hermosillo, Sonora; Yuma, Arizona; Phoenix, Arizona; and Tucson, Arizona, all within five hours or less by car. Puerto Pe√±asco International Airport also serves Sonoyta residents since 2008, with flights to other points in Mexico. The border between Sonoyta and Lukeville, Arizona, is open from 6:00 a.m. until 12:00 Midnight MST.

He was a young Israeli Orthodox Jewish scholar and rabbi who was most famous for his leadership of Kahane Chai, a far-right political party that broke from his father's Kach party after Meir Kahane's assassination in 1990. He was convicted several times by Israeli courts for advocating violence against Arabs.\\"State of Israel v. Binyamin Kahane\\" . Supreme Court of Israel. 27 November 2000.

He is an Orthodox Jew originally from Boston who now lives in the Jewish community of Hebron in Tel Rumeida with his wife and nine children. He was the leader of the far right-oriented Jewish National Front party. He is now a member of Otzma Yehudit. He was the \\"right-hand man\\" of assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane, acting as spokesman for the American rabbi's Kach organization for ten years, until it was outlawed in Israel and the US as a terrorist organization. The mainstream Israeli press regularly describes him as an \\"extreme right-wing activist\\".  Biography  Marzel was born in 1959 in Boston, Massachusetts, and emigrated to Israel with his family when he was six weeks old, settling in Jerusalem's Bayit Vegan neighbourhood. Although his father Shlomo was a respected educator who did not deal much with politics, Baruch joined Kahane's Jewish Defense League at age 13. He gave up his US citizenship when he ran for the Knesset. He served in the IDF Armored Corps and fought in the 1982 Lebanon War, participating in battles along the Beirut- Damascus highway, after which he served in the United States as a representative for Sar-El. Marzel and his wife Sarah have nine children.https://www.inn.co.il/News/News.aspx/39632  Political activism  From his youth, he participated in the Kach movement, and for nearly a decade, he served as its spokesperson. Marzel was elected head of the Kach movement's secretariat, after Kahane was assassinated in New York. A splinter group from Kach, Kahane Chai, was led by Kahane's son Binyamin Ze'ev Kahane. In 2003, Marzel joined Herut and Paul Eidelberg's Yamin Yisrael party to become the number-two candidate on the party list, after Michael Kleiner, in the bid to enter the 16th Knesset session. The election advertisements featured him prominently with the traditional Hebrew saying \\"Hazak U'Baruch\\" (literally, strong and blessed, ), a pun on Marzel's first name. Herut narrowly missed the minimum number of votes needed to enter the Knesset. In 2004, he founded the Jewish National Front, and headed its Knesset list in the 2006 elections. During the election campaign, Marzel called on the Israeli military to \\"carry out a targeted killing against (left-wing figure) Uri Avnery and his leftist collaborators\\". This came in reaction to Avnery earlier saying on Israeli radio station Kol Israel that the assassination of Israeli tourism minister Rehavam Zeevi was a Palestinian \\"targeted killing\\", like the Israeli military's \\"targeted killings\\" of Palestinian political leaders. According to Gush Shalom, \\"the radio did not quote [Avnery's] next words: 'I am against all assassinations, both by Israelis and Palestinians.'\\" Marzel was considered too far-right for Israel's hard-right parties, such as the National Union or National Religious Party (today's HaBayit HaYehudi party). Ultimately, the Jewish National Front received 24,824 votes (0.79%), less than half the minimum 2% required to enter the Knesset. In 2009, after fellow party member Michael Ben-Ari won a seat in Knesset on the National Union (Israel) list, Marzel agreed to serve as Ben-Ari's parliamentary aide. Marzel had originally planned to run independently. They eventually agreed not to submit their party's list on their own, and instead placed Ben-Ari on the National Union party list. In 2013, Marzel ran for the Knesset again, this time on the third slot of the newly founded Otzma LeYisrael party, which splintered from National Union.Otzma LeYisrael Central Elections Committee However, the party failed to cross the electoral threshold. Prior to the election, other right- wing parties, such as the Jewish Home party, had rejected including or co- operating with Marzel, considering him to be too outspoken and too far-right. Prior to the 2015 Israeli election, Marzel was put 4th on the Yachad-Otzma Yehudit technical bloc. Marzel's inclusion came as a result of a compromise between the two parties, including the exclusion of Michael Ben-Ari and the inclusion of Marzel. In February 2015, the Election Committee disqualified Marzel, along with Arab MK Haneen Zoabi, from running in the election. The decision squeaked by with a 17 to 16 majority. The decision came after past attempts to block Marzel failed. The reasons given for the disqualification of Marzel were several statements attributed to him, which groups petitioning the move claimed qualified as \\"racism\\". Following Marzel's appeal, The Supreme Court accepted the appeals by both MK Haneen Zoabi and Marzel, against the decision of the Central Election Committee (CEC), which decided to disqualify them from participating in the next Knesset. In the end, the Yachad-Otzma bloc failed to pass the election threshold by a mere 11,000 votes, thus not entering the Knesset. He is a writer for the Israeli newspaper Arutz Sheva.  Legal issues  Baruch Marzel was first arrested by police at age 14. His first conviction followed three years later. According to a 2003 report in the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, \\"Marzel had acquired a police record of some 40 files before he was 30\\".Raphael Ahren,'The extremist who could bring Kahanism back to the Knesset,' The Times of Israel 16 February 2015. The report goes on to detail his criminal record, including assaults on Palestinians (one earning him a 12-month suspended prison sentence), an Israeli police officer, an Israeli left-wing activist, and the journalist Uri Avnery. In August 2012, Israeli police arrested Baruch Marzel at the entrance to the town of Kiryat Arba over his failure to report for questioning. He was suspected of being involved in several incidents in Hebron that took place six months prior, in which several Palestinians allegedly were attacked. In 2014, Yariv Oppenheimer, chairman of Peace Now, signed a police complaint against Marzel alleging threats against his life by his followers. On his Facebook page, Oppenheimer wrote that he is \\"exiting the police station now, worried and pessimistic. The telephone won't stop ringing, and on the other end, human scum who follow Marzel continue to curse and threaten.\\" In March 2015, six days before the 2015 legislative election, the Judea-Samaria District Police filed charges in the Jerusalem Magistrate's Court alleging that Marzel attacked a Palestinian Arab in 2013. According to the indictment, on 8 February 2013, Marzel entered the home of Hebron resident Issa Amro, as the activist was passing through to visit the Cave of the Patriarchs, and began attacking the Palestinian for \\"unknown reasons\\" after Amro demanded he leave. Marzel's attorney Itamar Ben-Gvir slammed the indictment, saying it \\"stinks of election tampering\\". This was echoed by Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein, who stepped in to demand an explanation as to why the indictment came two years after the incident. In February 2017, Marzel was arrested after clashing with police while protesting the demolition of Amona, a Jewish settlement in the West Bank. Controversies  Anti-LGBT activism  Marzel has in the past advocated violence towards homosexuals in Israel, calling for a religious war against them during a radio interview. In 2006, in the days leading up to a planned gay pride parade in Jerusalem, Marzel reportedly stated that, \\"The stabbing incident during last year's parade will seem minor in comparison with what is anticipated this year. We have to declare a holy war.\\" Marzel also was involved in the controversial March 2009 flag parade through Umm al-Fahm. He led protests against the eighth Jerusalem Gay Pride parade of 2010, opining that \\"[homosexuality] is a disease of choice, and a man can change his taste and his ways. When someone has AIDS, they tell them not to infect others, so why are these people allowed to march here in Jerusalem and infect us with their disease?\\" During the 2012 Gay Pride march in Jerusalem, Marzel led a counter-demonstration in the ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Mea Shearim. He brought with him to the demonstration three donkeys. Each of the donkeys bore a sign, one of which read \\"I'm proud too\\", a second one read \\"Proud Donkey\\", and the third one simply read \\"Pride March\\". Five years later, during the 2017 Jerusalem gay pride march, Marzel again led a counter-demonstration. Despite his previous rhetoric, Marzel stated that he did not protest against LGBT people on a personal level, saying: \\"I'm not fighting against these people personally, but against the parade and the phenomenon. [...] The nuclear family is a holy thing, and it's important to protect it.\\"  Anti- assimilation activism  Marzel is seen as a central figure in the anti- assimilation Lehava group, along with Rabbi Ben-Zion Gopstein. In 2006, Marzel sent an open letter to Linor Abargil, asking her not to marry non-Jewish Lithuanian NBA player ≈†ar≈´nas Jasikeviƒçius. A similar open letter was addressed in March 2010 to Israeli model Bar Refaeli, urging her not to marry her non-Jewish boyfriend at that time, American actor Leonardo DiCaprio. Representing the Lehava organization, Marzel tried to convince Refaeli that her ancestors would have opposed such a marriage.Jessica Elgot, \\"Bar Refaeli warned 'Don't marry Leo Di Caprio'\\", The Jewish Chronicle, 15 March 2010 In 2013, he was among 50 activists who held an anti-assimilation protest at a wedding between an Arab man and a Jewish woman. In July 2014, Facebook removed Marzel's page after readers complained about incitement.

He was director of the University of Illinois Observatory from 1903 to 1922 where he performed innovative work with the selenium cell. In 1922 he became director of the Washburn Observatory at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison where he remained until 1948. After 1948, Stebbins continued his research at Lick Observatory until his final retirement in 1958. Stebbins brought photoelectric photometry from its infancy in the early 1900s to a mature technique by the 1950s, when it succeeded photography as the primary method of photometry. He used the new technique to investigate eclipsing binaries, the reddening of starlight by interstellar dust, colors of galaxies, and variable stars. Biography Joel Stebbins, then a graduate student, at Lick Observatory about 1902 posing next to the 36-inch refractor. Joel Stebbins was born in Omaha, Nebraska, on July 30, 1878, the son of Charles Stebbins, an office worker at the Union Pacific Railroad and his wife Sara Ann n√©e Stubbs. Stebbins had two sisters, Eunice and Millicent. He attended elementary and high school in Omaha, before entering the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln in 1896. He received his Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in 1899, and remained for a year as a graduate student before leaving for the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, where he studied astronomy at the Washburn Observatory under George C. Comstock. Stebbins published his first paper, concerning the light curve of Nova Persei with Comstock in 1901. He then received a fellowship from the University of California's Lick Observatory. He earned his Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree there under the supervision of William Wallace Campbell, writing a thesis on the spectra of Omicron Ceti. His was only the third PhD to be awarded for astronomy by the University of California. His thesis was subsequently published in the Astrophysical Journal in 1903. Even before Stebbins received his doctorate, he took a job as an instructor in astronomy at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign and director of the University of Illinois Observatory. He married May Louise Prentiss, who had been a classmate at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln on June 27, 1905. They had two children, a son, Robert, and a daughter, Isabelle. Stebbins began making observations with a polarizing photometer. Frustrated by its use, he worked with F.C. Brown to develop a photometer based on a selenium cell. Beginning in 1907, Stebbins began the first measurements using the selenium cell photometer first on the moon and then later, as the sensitivity of the instrument was improved, on variable stars He examined eclipsing binaries such as Algol starting in 1910. By 1913, Henry Norris Russell had developed the theory of eclipsing binaries, and Stebbins realized that there were many undiscovered ones. He soon found that Beta Aurigae and Delta Orionis were eclipsing binaries. Further discoveries followed. The development of the photoelectric cell by Jakob Kunz revolutionized astronomical photometry. Kunz's photoelectric cells were many times more sensitive than what was available commercially and therefore able to detect faint star light. In 1915, Stebbins used the new photometers to examine Beta Lyrae, a more irregular binary system. The new equipment allowed observations of increasingly faint stars. Stebbins work was recognized with the American Academy of Arts and Sciences' Rumford Prize in 1913, and the United States National Academy of Sciences' Henry Draper Medal in 1915. The University of Illinois Observatory has been designated a National Historic Landmark based on the significance of Stebbins' and Kunz's work. In 1922, Stebbins relocated to the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, where he became the director of the Washburn Observatory in succession to George C. Comstock. Stebbins conducted systematic photometric studies of the O-type and B-type main-sequence stars and globular clusters. In later years, he became interested in cosmic dust. His students included Olin J. Eggen, Charles M. Huffer, Gerald Kron and Albert Whitford. Stebbins retired from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Washburn Observatory in 1948 at the age of seventy, and then went to work at the Lick Observatory, collaborating with Gerald Kron, who had once been his student. They used photometric methods to obtain new values for the luminosity of the Cepheids. This confirmed Walter Baade's extragalactic distance scale. Having dealt with the bright Cepheids, Stebbins and Kron used photometric techniques to study the Sun, which is orders of magnitude brighter than any other object in the sky. Obtaining an accurate assessment of its stellar color and magnitude. He retired for good at the age of eighty. Stebbins also contributed to ornithology, with his pioneering paper, with E.A. Fath, The Use of Astronomical Telescopes in Determining the Speeds of Migrating Birds. In his later years, he suffered from leukaemia. He died at Palo Alto hospital on March 16, 1966. He was survived by his wife May, son Robert and daughter Isabelle. Some of his papers are in the University of Illinois Archives, but most of his correspondence and scientific papers are preserved in the University of Wisconsin-Madison Archives. Some of his correspondence, related especially to his early and later days at Lick Observatory, resides in the Mary Lea Shane Archive of Lick Observatory, which is held at the archives of the University of California- Santa Cruz.

A result of a rushed attempt to create a self-propelled gun, the vehicle had numerous problems, was produced in limited numbers and was soon replaced by better designs. Design and development The rapid manoeuvre warfare practiced in the North African Campaign led to a requirement for a self-propelled artillery vehicle armed with the 25-pounder gun-howitzer. In June 1941, the development was entrusted to the Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company. A prototype was ready for trials by August and ordered by November 1941.The complete guide to tanks and armoured fighting vehicles, p 312, The result was a vehicle with the formal title: \\"Ordnance QF 25-pdr on Carrier Valentine 25-pdr Mk 1\\". The vehicle was based on the Valentine II hull, with the turret replaced by a fixed boxy superstructure with large rear doors. It was nicknamed the \\"Bishop\\" for its high mitre-like superstructure. Into this superstructure the 25-pounder gun-howitzer was fitted. As a consequence of the gun mounting, the resulting vehicle had very high silhouette, which is a disadvantage in desert warfare. The maximum elevation for the gun was limited to reducing the range to , about half that of the same gun on a wheeled carriage. The maximum depression was , traverse was , and the vehicle could also carry a Bren light machine gun. By July 1942, had been built; as the last being built, an order for a further placed, with an option for a further the tender was abandoned in favour of the American M7 105 mm SP howitzer, named \\"Priest\\" in British service. Turkey received 48 Bishops in 1943. A Bishop deployed on an earth ramp at a former German airfield in Sicily, October 1943. Combat history The Bishop first saw action during the Second Battle of El Alamein in North Africa and remained in service during the early part of the Italian Campaign. Due to its limitations and the Valentine's characteristic slow speed, the Bishop was poorly received. To increase range, crews would build large earthen ramps and run the Bishop onto them, tilting the vehicle back to increase the elevation. The Bishop was replaced by the M7 Priest and Sexton when those became available in sufficient numbers and surviving Bishops were diverted for training in self-propelled gun tactics.Armored Fighting Vehicles 1999, p. 114. British self-propelled guns with ecclesiastical names A British self-propelled gun armed with the Ordnance QF 25-pounder in design from 1941 was nicknamed \\"the Bishop\\" as its appearance was said to resemble a bishop's mitre. A replacement, the US 105 Millimeter Howitzer Motor Carriage M7 was called \\"Priest\\" by the British, as part of its superstructure was said to resemble a priest's pulpit. Following this line of names, a 1942 self-propelled gun armed with the QF 6 pounder was the Deacon, and a 1943 vehicle with the QF 25-pounder was the Sexton. This practice was continued after the war with FV433 Abbot and ended in 1993 with the introduction of the AS-90 (although delays and overruns in the development process for the AS90 earned it the nickname \\"Choirboy\\" because it had been \\"buggered by Vickers\\").

Troops sent by Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy, attempted a surprise attack during the night of 11‚Äì12 December 1602, but according to legend, were repulsed by a cook who dumped boiling vegetable soup on the invaders before raising an alarm. The celebrations and other commemorative activities are usually held on 12 December or the closest weekend. Background For years, the duke coveted the wealth of the self- governing, independent, republican, Protestant city-state. When Charles Emmanuel came to the throne of the House of Savoy in 1580, he longed to make Geneva his capital north of the Alps and crush Protestantism. Pope Clement VIII offered encouragement; in 1602 he appointed as Catholic bishop of Geneva Francis de Sales, an effective preacher who had recently been successful in re-Catholicizing the Chablais district of Savoy on the south side of Lake Geneva.

On December 11 and December 12 (Old Style) 1602‚Äîthe darkest night of the year‚Äîthe forces of the Duke of Savoy, under the command of the seigneur d'Albigny, and those of Charles Emmanuel's brother-in-law, Philip III of Spain, launched an attack on the city-state of Geneva.Gaspare Lorchano, Mercurius Gallobelgicus, vol. 4 (Cologne, Wilhelm Lutzenkirch, 1603), p. 465f. Available on Google Books The troops marched along the Arve River at night and assembled at Plainpalais, just outside the walls of Geneva, at 2 o'clock in the morning. The original plan was to send in a group of commandos to open the city gate and let the other troops in. The Geneva citizens defeated the invaders by preventing them from scaling the wall using cannon fire, and by fighting in the streets against the few who managed to climb over (a climb in French is an escalade). The alarm was raised, the church bells were rung and the Genevese were alerted. The night guard Isaac Mercier succeeded in cutting the rope holding up the portcullis, thus foiling the plan to open the main city gate. The populace fought alongside their town militia and the duke's 2000-plus mercenaries were defeated. The Genevese lost 18 men in the fighting; the Savoyards suffered 54 fatalities and the troops had to retreat. Thirteen invaders who had been taken prisoner, including several well-born gentlemen, were summarily hanged the following day as brigands, since they could not be treated as prisoners of war, peace having been repeatedly sworn on the part of Savoy. Compagnie de 1602 . According to Genevese legend, Catherine Cheynel (\\"M√®re Royaume), originally from Lyon and the wife of Pierre Royaume, seized a large cauldron of hot soup and poured it on the attackers. The Royaume family lived just above the La Monnaie town gate. The heavy cauldron of boiling soup landed on the head of a Savoyard attacker, killing him. The commotion that this caused also helped to rouse the townsfolk to defend the city. After the defeat, the Duke of Savoy accepted a lasting peace, sealed by the Treaty of St. Julien of 12 July 1603. The story of L'Escalade is told in a song called \\"C√© qu'√® l'ain√¥\\", written in a Franco-Proven√ßal dialect around 1603 by an unknown author. The song has become the \\"national\\" anthem of Geneva; while the complete version comprises 68 stanzas, only four of them are usually sung.C√© qu'√® lain√¥: National hymn of Geneva Lyrics and French translation It was also celebrated in verse by Samuel Chappuzeau in his Gen√®ve D√©livr√©e. Celebration Although the armed conflict actually took place after midnight, in the early morning on December 12, celebrations and other commemorative activities are usually held on December 11 or the closest weekend. Celebrations include a large marmite (cauldron) made of chocolate and filled with marzipan vegetables and candies wrapped in the Geneva colours of red and gold. It is customary for the eldest and youngest in the room to smash the marmite, while reciting, \\"Ainsi p√©rirent les ennemis de la R√©publique! \\" (Thus perished the enemies of the Republic), referring to how Catherine Cheynel, better known as M√®re Royaume, poured boiling hot vegetable soup on soldiers climbing up the walls of the city. Other traditions include mulled wine, a large serving of soup, and children in various types of costumes knocking on people's doors and singing Escalade songs for candies. It is also common for children in school to prepare vegetable soup, which is served to parents and families that night. Teenagers tend to throw eggs, shaving cream, and flour at each other as part of the celebration. The high school students parade together by first going to \\"conquer\\" each other and end up in the central square of the old town after walking through the rues basses to the plaine de Plainpalais and back. There is also a parade on Friday evening: the names of the eighteen who died‚ÄîJacques Billon finally died of his wounds a year later‚Äîare called out, one after another. The historical procession on Sunday features more or less 800 people (from old Genevese families) with historical costumes, the remaining fragments of the ladders used by the Savoyards, and horses. This parade‚Äîorganised since 1926 by the Compagnie de 1602‚Äîattracts every year generally tens of thousand spectators. Escalade Run Since 1978 there has been another element to the celebration of the Escalade, with a road running event being held the weekend of or preceding the night of the 11th (depending on whether or not the 11th falls on a weekend). The run traditionally starts in the parc des Bastions and goes through the Old City of Geneva, before finishing near the start again. It is one of the most significant annual events in Geneva. There are multiple events for different age groups.

Located in Stampede Park in the southeast end of downtown Calgary, the Saddledome was built in 1983 to replace the Stampede Corral as the home of the Calgary Flames of the National Hockey League, and to host ice hockey and figure skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics. The facility also hosts concerts, conferences and other sporting championships, and events for the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede. It underwent a major renovation in 1994‚Äì95 and sold its naming rights, during which its original name of Olympic Saddledome was changed to Canadian Airlines Saddledome. The facility was given the name Pengrowth Saddledome in 2000, after Pengrowth Management Ltd. signed a ten- year agreement. It adopted its current name in October 2010 as Scotiabank signed on as title sponsor. The Saddledome is owned by the City of Calgary, who leases it to the Saddledome Foundation, a non-profit organization, to oversee its operation. Since 1996, it has been managed by the Flames. The Saddledome was damaged during the 2013 Alberta floods but was repaired and reopened in time for the 2013‚Äì14 NHL season. The arena's roof is shaped like a saddle, thus earning the name \\"Saddledome\\".  Construction  Calgary had been served for 30 years by the Stampede Corral when the Calgary Flames arrived in 1980. With a total capacity of 8,700, the Corral was the largest arena in Canada west of Toronto in 1950, but had fallen below major league standards by the 1970s. The Corral was deemed insufficient for the National Hockey League (NHL) in 1977, leading the World Hockey Association's Calgary Cowboys to fold rather than hope to be a team selected to merge with the NHL. Calgary's bid to host the 1988 Winter Olympics, coupled with the arrival of the Flames, drove the need to build a new arena. City Council debated the merits of several locations for the city's new Olympic Coliseum, and narrowed their choices down to two areas in the Victoria Park neighbourhood on the east end of downtown. Two other sites, one on the west end of downtown, and a late bid by several businessmen pushing to build the arena in the northern suburb of Airdrie were also considered. The Saddledome's location within Stampede Park, as seen from the Calgary Tower The Victoria Park Community Association fought the bid to build the arena in their neighborhood, threatening to oppose the city's Olympic bid if necessary. City Council voted on March 3, 1981 to build the proposed 20,000 seat arena on the Stampede grounds, immediately east of the Corral and south of Victoria Park. The community continued to fight the city over rezoning the land to allow for the new arena amidst fears of traffic congestion in their neighbourhood which resulted in numerous costly delays to the start of construction. In a bid to end the battle, Mayor Ralph Klein asked the provincial government in July 1981 to take over the land designated for the arena to bypass the appeals process and force approval. The province supported the city amidst protests by community associations and invoked rarely used powers to overrule planning regulations, allowing construction to begin. The following day, on July 29, 1981, builders began construction of the arena. The International Olympic Committee was impressed that the project was underway, as noted in the XV Olympic Winter Games official report which stated \\"The fact that this facility was already being built added credibility to (Calgary's) bid and proved to be a positive factor in demonstrating Calgary's commitment to hosting the Games\\". The facility was designed by Graham McCourt Architects. While they set out to design a unique building, the idea of a western theme never occurred to Barry Graham or his team. The roof of the building was designed to be a reverse hyperbolic paraboloid, allowing for a pillar free view from all seats and reducing the interior volume by up to one- third when compared to traditional arenas, resulting in reduced heating, lighting and maintenance costs, plus the floating roof can flex to compensate for the city's frequent temperature fluctuations. When the design was unveiled, the roof was immediately referred to as being saddle-shaped. Of 1,270 entries submitted in a contest to name the arena, 735 involved the word Saddle. The winning name in the contest, Olympic Saddledome, was drawn from a hat filled with several similar saddle-themed names. At the time the name received a tepid reception from some, including the chairman of Calgary's Olympic Organizing Committee (OCO), Frank King, who was quoted as saying \\"It is neither Olympic nor western, and it's not even dome\\". The designers won several architectural and engineering awards for their work on the Saddledome, and were honoured by the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada at its millennium celebration of architecture in 2000. As of 2008, the Saddledome was still reported as the world record holder for the longest spanning hyperbolic paraboloid concrete shell. The Saddledome was featured on the cover of Time magazine on September 27, 1987, for an article discussing the city of Calgary and the upcoming 1988 Olympics. The location of the Saddledome within Stampede Park allows for easy access to Calgary's CTrain light rail transit system via the Victoria Park/Stampede station that stands parallel to Macleod Trail. The CTrain station, BMO Centre, Stampede Corral and Saddledome are all connected via a Plus 15 pedestrian skyway. Direct vehicle access is gained from the north via 5th Street East or Olympic Way. History The Saddledome and Calgary skyline at night The arena was initially projected to cost $60 million to build, and later revised to over $80 million. Attempts to fast track construction resulted in a $16 million cost overrun, resulting in a final cost of $97.7 million and an eight-month delay in its completion. Builders faced delays while building the roof as numerous adjustments were required to fit the giant concrete slabs between the array of cables that held them in place. Upset with the excess cost, opposition politicians in Alberta demanded a public hearing into the issue. A hearing conducted by the city placed much of the blame on the project manager, while the city and province were required to pay the additional costs. When it opened on October 15, 1983, the Olympic Saddledome served to boost the morale of a city that was experiencing a significant downturn as a result of the international oil market collapse, high interest rates, and the federal government's National Energy Policy. During the first event, an NHL game between the Flames and the Edmonton Oilers, the standard of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau was the first thing booed by a population upset with the government's policies. The Oilers defeated the Flames 4‚Äì3 in front of a sold out crowd of nearly 17,000 fans. The initial seating capacity was 16,605 for hockey as the upper loges were not immediately completed. As the Olympics neared, the Calgary organizing committee spent $1 million to add over 2,600 seats to the upper loges in a bid to alleviate a scandal that resulted from the organizing committee giving its partners and sponsors preferential treatment in ticket sales. With a capacity of 20,016, the International Ice Hockey Federation noted that it was the largest arena ever used at the Winter Games, and called the facility \\"the finest international rink in the world\\" The International Olympic Committee praised the city's commitment to hosting the Olympics, noting in its official report that constructing the arena prior to being awarded the Games lent credibility to Calgary's bid and positively influenced voters. The Saddledome was the first arena in North America designed to accommodate the larger international ice surface (international rinks are wider than NHL rinks). The Saddledome reached its highest capacity in the early '90s at 20,230. Inside the Saddledome during a Calgary Roughnecks game The Flames petitioned the City of Calgary and the Saddledome Foundation to upgrade the facility in 1994, requesting renovations to add additional luxury boxes and a new club section. The Flames insisted the upgrades were necessary for the team to remain viable in the arena. They argued it was important that their landlord bring the arena up to the higher standards they felt was required. The team lobbied City Council in the hope it would agree to fund the majority of the $18 million renovation using federal infrastructure funds. At the same time, they rejected a counter proposal for applying a ticket surcharge to pay the cost. Media reports claimed the team was considering relocating out of Calgary if council did not agree. Flames' owners denied the reports, but said they had threatened to build a new rink elsewhere in the city. City Council supported the Flames' proposal in a 9‚Äì6 vote following several months of negotiations. Renovations occurred between 1994 and 1995 and saw the addition of 41 new luxury suites at the top of the lower bowl, an 1,172 seat club section, a new restaurant, expanded offices for the Flames, Saddledome management and Hockey Canada, as well as a significant restructuring of the public concourse and a new parkade structure. The arena remained operational until the spring of 1995 despite ongoing construction, but was closed entirely between April and October 1995. The Saddledome officially reopened on October 25, 1995 for the Flames' first home game of the 1995‚Äì96 NHL season. Prior to its reopening, the Flames signed a deal with Canadian Airlines to rename the facility. Under a 20-year agreement worth approximately $1 million per year, the arena became the Canadian Airlines Saddledome. Removing the \\"Olympic\\" moniker was controversial with both the public and City Council, though the city voted in favour of the deal which included the donation of a portion of the naming rights to fund amateur sports within the city. The arena was renamed again in 2000 when Canadian Airlines was acquired by Air Canada and ceased operations. Pengrowth Management Ltd. signed a 10-year agreement that gave the facility the name Pengrowth Saddledome. The arena has received cosmetic upgrades in recent years. In 2004, the Flames spent $1 million on a LED \\"power ring\\" display that lines the facing of the second level. The JumboTron that was installed in 1995 was replaced in 2006 with a new HD video scoreboard. Along with the new board, the previous speakers were replaced with Apogee ALA-9 arrays in 2007. Manufactured by Daktronics, the display has 12 screens and two LED ribbons, and was called the Enmax Energy Board. 2013 flood Flooding of the lower bowl reached the eighth row of seating. The Saddledome was one of many buildings impacted by the 2013 Alberta floods. The flooding of the Elbow and Bow Rivers swamped many areas of the city, including Stampede Park where the Saddledome is located. The event level of the arena was filled with water, also wrecking the high definition scoreboard that had been sitting on the rink floor during the summer downtime, while the dressing rooms and control room for the video replay screen were swamped. At a press conference held on June 22, 2013, team president Ken King stated that the arena had flooded up to the eighth row and that the event level of the facility was a \\"total loss\\". He added that the team's equipment and some memorabilia had also been destroyed, but expressed confidence that the facility would be repaired and ready in time for the October start to the 2013‚Äì14 Calgary Flames season. Repairs to the facility forced the cancellation of all concerts and agricultural events scheduled for the 2013 Calgary Stampede. Crews worked around the clock to repair the facility; Saddledome director of building operations Robert Blanchard estimated that 650,000 man hours of work was performed on the facility and noted that they had compressed a six-month project into two. The facility was granted its occupancy permit in late August, and the first event following the Saddledome's reopening was an Eagles concert on September 11. The first hockey game was September 14, a Flames pre-season contest. Events The Saddledome hosted the 2009 Tim Hortons Brier As the home of the Flames, the Saddledome hosted the 1985 NHL All-Star Game, and the 2000 NHL Entry Draft. The Flames have played three Stanley Cup Finals series in the Saddledome: 1986, 1989 and 2004. The arena is also the home of the Calgary Hitmen of the Western Hockey League (WHL). The Hitmen won the President's Cup in 1999 before a WHL playoff record crowd of 17,139. Playing in the largest arena in the WHL, the Hitmen also hold league records for overall attendance (362,227 in 2004‚Äì05), as well as single game (19,305 in 2007‚Äì08). The Saddledome is also the home of the Calgary Roughnecks of the National Lacrosse League (NLL) and hosted the 2005 NLL All-Star Game. It has hosted the NLL Champion's Cup game four times: 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2019. The Roughnecks would raise the Cup on their home floor in all of these games except 2014. The stadium was one of the venues for the 2012 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. The opening of the Saddledome allowed Calgary to host major musical acts that were bypassing the city in the early 1980s, because the city's existing facilities were not large enough to accommodate the industry's top performers. The Moody Blues were the first musical act to appear with Stevie Ray Vaughan opening, in November 1983, while Rod Stewart has made the most appearances in the Dome, 11. Many other top acts have made stops in the Saddledome, however the inability of the roof to support the massive light, speaker and special effect rigs that some performers currently use has led the city to again be bypassed for some major tours. In addition to hockey and figure skating at the 1988 Olympics,1988 Winter Olympics official report. Part 1. pp. 152-7. the Saddledome has been the site of numerous major national and international events. The facility has hosted Brier, the Canadian men's curling championship, on four occasions (1997, 2002, 2009 and 2015). It also hosted the women's championship, the Tournament of Hearts in 1995. The 2006 World Figure Skating Championships was also held in the arena. The WWF pay- per-view event In Your House 16: Canadian Stampede was also held at the Saddledome in July 1997. Among non-sporting events, the Saddledome most recently hosted a public address by the Dalai Lama in 2009 that was attended by 15,000 people. In 2005, Queen Elizabeth II attended a celebration of Alberta's centennial at the Saddledome. It has also hosted PBR Bud Light Cup events; in 1998 and 1999 the event was known as \\"Cody Snyder's Bullbustin'\\", and in 2000 and 2001 the event was called the Professional Bull Riders Canadian Open. The Saddledome has also been a host for PBR Canada events. On October 3, 2016, the Saddledome hosted a National Basketball Association preseason game between the Toronto Raptors and Denver Nuggets. On July 21, 2012, the Saddledome hosted an Ultimate Fighting Championship event, which was UFC 149. Six years later, on July 28, 2018, the Saddledome hosted another UFC event, which was UFC on Fox: Alvarez vs. Poirier 2. The arena was also the site of the 1990 Liberal Party leadership convention. Amenities The Saddledome seats 19,289 for hockey and lacrosse, with different capacities for other events depending on the arena's configuration. It has 72 luxury suites, 41 of which were constructed at the top of the lower bowl in 1995 and 31 were constructed at the top of the second level when the facility was built. There are also six party suites on the corners of the upper loges that are rented on an event by event basis. Sections 115 through 122 of the lower bowl form The Club and offers in-seat concession service at Flames games.This was later expanded to the remainder of the lower bowl during Flames, Hitmen and Roughnecks games via the Saddledome Live app. The Club features a private dining room available during Flames games, large concerts and private events. Dutton's Canadian Lounge is a sports bar located at the west entrance to the building. There are three additional restaurants within the facility: The Saddleroom Grill, the Alumni Lounge and the King Club. The Iconic Platinum Club is a 188-seat executive club accessible with a purchased membership. It features a private bar and restaurant as well as a fully functional business centre. Saddledome Foundation The City of Calgary established the Saddledome Foundation in 1983 and leased the arena for 50-years to the non- profit organization. Its mandate was to \\"oversee the operation in a manner that protects taxpayers and benefits amateur sports at the local, provincial and national level\\". The foundation is made up of a board of nine directors: three appointed by the city, three appointed by the province, and one each appointed by the Calgary Olympic Development Association (now WinSport Canada), Hockey Canada and the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede. The foundation contracted the Stampede to manage the arena, and through its lease agreements with the Stampede and the Flames, earned 15% of gross concession sales, 50% of net income from luxury suites and executive seating and investment income on the arena's revenues. The Flames signed a 20-year lease in 1983 that earned them 70% of advertising revenues and 90% of ticket revenues. The Stampede earned 85% of concession revenues and all revenue from parking. As part of the 1994 deal with the city, the Flames bought out the Stampede's contract for $20 million and took over management of the facility. While the city and Saddledome Foundation paid for the 1994‚Äì95 renovations, the new agreement required the Flames to pay for future arena maintenance and repairs, as well as any further renovations. The Flames agreed to manage the arena for 20 years and to contribute $14.5 million toward amateur sport in the city over that time. The Saddledome Foundation retains the responsibility of distributing funds to amateur sport. From its inception through 2007, it had allocated over $20 million toward this cause. Future The Saddledome is one of the oldest arenas in the NHL, fueling speculation that it is due to be replaced. Only Madison Square Garden in New York City and the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, New York are older than the Saddledome; however, both arenas underwent major renovations in the 2010s, and the New York Islanders are scheduled to move to UBS Arena in Elmont, New York once it is completed in 2021. Flames president and chief executive officer Ken King said in 2008 that plans for a new arena were \\"five to eight years away\\" creating the expectation that the team hoped to have a new arena built for when their lease was due to expire in 2014, but such plans never came to fruition. Team chairman Murray Edwards argues that the ability of the facility to host major events and concerts is growing increasingly limited as the facility ages. Along with Edwards, sports financial analysts note that newer arenas generate far more revenue for their teams than the Saddledome does for the Flames. It is expected that any new arena would also be located either on the Stampede Grounds or elsewhere in downtown Calgary. While NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman has lobbied on behalf of both the Flames and the Oilers for government support, Calgary mayor Naheed Nenshi and alderman John Mar have stated their opposition using taxpayer money to help fund a new arena. King stated that the Flames have concepts and designs for a new building, but are not ready to release them. Some of the plans being considered for Stampede Park would include lowering the city's C-train light rail transit line below ground and run straight into a new facility. In 2015, Calgary Sports and Entertainment proposed CalgaryNEXT‚Äîa sports complex in the western downtown area that would feature a new arena and football stadium to replace the Saddledome and McMahon Stadium. The proposal was shot down in 2017 by Calgary's city council, who voted to support a \\"plan B\\" of a new arena on a site adjacent to the existing Saddledome, which is currently used as a parking lot for the Stampede grounds. On September 12, 2017, King stated that the team was no longer pursuing the arena, as \\"we've been working for a long time trying to come up with a formula that really works to replace this building and we really put our best foot forward and I‚Äôve come to the conclusion sadly and I‚Äôm very disappointed that I don't think we can make a deal that works for us\\". Mayor Nenshi subsequently proposed a partnership wherein portions of the cost of \\"plan B\\" would be covered by the city, and the rest covered by the team ownership and user surcharges. King objected to this proposal. Critics alleged that the Flames had been trying to use the issue of a new arena to influence the 2017 municipal elections, where Nenshi was elected for a third term as mayor of Calgary. King denied that this was the case, stating that \\"we did not raise this as an election issue: it became an election issue\\". On July 30, 2019, Calgary city council approved a $550 million Event Centre to replace the Saddledome. The new Event Centre will be located to the north of the Saddledome in the Victoria Park neighbourhood. The city of Calgary will own the arena while Calgary Sports and Entertainment Corporation will be responsible for the facility's operation and maintenance under a 35-year lease agreement, which includes a non-relocation clause for the Flames during that period. Construction on the building is expected begin in 2021 and will have a capacity of around 19,000; plans for the Event Centre also includes the possibility for a smaller arena to replace the Stampede Corral. The Saddledome will be demolished once the new arena opens.

CFRB's studios are located in the Entertainment District at 250 Richmond Street West, a building which is adjacent to 299 Queen Street West, while its 4-tower transmitter array is located in the Clarkson neighbourhood of Mississauga. CFRB 1010 is simulcast across Canada on Bell Satellite TV satellite channel 964. It is currently the third most listened-to private station in the market tied with Zoomer Media's classical station CFMX. History Founded in 1927, CFRB was not Toronto's very first broadcaster, but it is the city's oldest broadcaster still operating today. It has also retained its original call letters since 1927. (CKYC was on the air from to 1925 to 1996, but only adopted those call letters in 1991 having previously used CKCL and CKEY; its frequency is now occupied by a completely different station, CHKT.) CFRB was founded by the Rogers Vacuum Tube Company (the precursor of Rogers Communications) to promote Edward S. Rogers Sr.'s invention of a batteryless radio receiver that could be operated using alternating current and therefore did not need the cumbersome battery that had previously been required. The station itself was a demonstration of Rogers' application of his invention to radio transmitters as well as receivers, a development that allowed for a signal that reproduced voices and music more clearly. The new type of transmitter also made CFRB the world's first all- electric radio station. The letters \\"RB\\" in the station's callsign stand for \\"Rogers' Batteryless\\". The station began transmitting on an experimental basis in January 1927 as 9RB, before being converted to commercial operation a few weeks later, on February 19, with the transmission of a live symphony orchestra concert conducted by Jack Arthur. During its first years, CFRB leased time to two phantom stations: CNRX, owned by Canadian National Railways and providing programs of Canada's first radio network, and CPRY, owned by the CNR's rival, the Canadian Pacific Railway. The CNR's network was discontinued in 1933, with many of its assets eventually passing to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), and the CPR's radio service was discontinued in 1935. CFRB's first studios were in a mansion on Jarvis Street north of Wellesley Street, built by the family of Hart Massey. In 1929, the station moved to purpose-built studios at 37 Bloor Street West. In the same year, the station became a network affiliate of the Columbia Broadcasting System. In 1932, CFRB began airing the General Motors Hockey Broadcast, which had originated on the CNR's network. This program eventually became Hockey Night in Canada, and continued to be aired by CFRB for many years, despite also airing on the CBC's flagship station CBL, and continues to this day on CBC Television. From the 1930s to the 1950s, CFRB was the radio broadcaster for the Toronto Santa Claus Parade. In 1937, CFRB began to simulcast on shortwave station CFRX at 6070 kHz. Following the sudden death of Edward S. Rogers, Sr. in 1939, Rogers Majestic Corporation Limited was sold in 1941 and became Standard Radio Limited. In turn, the company was acquired by Argus Corporation in 1946. On November 1, 1946, Wally Crouter joined CFRB. He eventually became its morning drive time host, a position he would hold until his retirement on November 1, 1996, after exactly fifty years at the station. CFRB and CJBC, owned by the CBC, made a frequency switch on September 1, 1948. CFRB moved to 1010 while CJBC took over the Class I-A clear-channel frequency at 860, previously used by CFRB.Broadcasting Magazine August 23, 1948, p. 32. Retrieved 14-3-2018 The CBC wanted its stations in major cities to be on Class I-A frequencies. But CFRB, which had been running at 20,000 watts, was boosted to 50,000 watts, giving it wide coverage over Southern Ontario. A long-lasting show, Calling All Britons featuring news, sports scores and music from Britain, began in 1965. It was hosted by Ray Sonin until his death in 1991. In 1965, CFRB moved its studios from 37 Bloor Street West to 2 St. Clair Avenue West (at Yonge Street). At around the same time, Standard Radio Limited was renamed Standard Broadcasting. The station's former downtown Toronto studios, shared with CHBM-FM (now owned by Newcap) and CKFM-FM. In 1978, Argus Corporation was acquired by Conrad Black and his brother Montegu, thus also giving them ownership of Standard Broadcasting. In November 1985, Slaight Broadcasting acquired Standard from the Blacks. In October 2007, Slaight sold Standard to Astral Media. CFRB was the number one station in the Toronto market for many decades according to the Bureau of Broadcast Measurement's ratings. However, it has declined in recent years and in 2006 was rated fifth.Quill, Greg, \\"CHFI-FM tops on local radio\\", Toronto Star, December 5, 2006 Ted Rogers, the communications mogul and son of CFRB's founder, had vowed to re-acquire the station that his family had lost after his father's death, and considered his failure to do so his greatest disappointment. Reports indicate that he continued to attempt to re-acquire CFRB right up until his death in December 2008.Pitts, Gordon Ted Rogers dies at 75 , The Globe and Mail, December 2, 2008 In July 2013, CFRB was acquired by Bell Media, a subsidiary of Bell Canada (the company which already owns CTV) as a result of a buyout of Astral Media. Shortly after the purchase, Bell announced that it would move the studios and offices of CFRB and sister station CKFM-FM from their long-time headquarters at St. Clair and Yonge, to 250 Richmond Street West at Richmond and Duncan (which already houses the operations of sister radio stations, CHUM and CHUM-FM) a building which is adjacent to 299 Queen Street West located at Queen and John streets (which already houses the operations of several Bell Media specialty television channels including CP24 and MuchMusic). The move took place on May 10, 2014.LISTEN: It's our last day at Yonge & St. Clair! newstalk1010.com, published May 9, 2014 Transmitter The transmitting antennas for CFRB are a prominent landmark along Toronto's waterfront and are visible from over 100 km away. They are used as a landmark for navigation by pilots, on approach to Toronto Pearson International Airport, or to Toronto Island Airport. The antenna array consists of 4 vertical masts, 550 feet in height.https://www.broadcasting- history.ca/listing_and_histories/radio/cfrb-am Shortwave radio station CFRX, which is affiliated with CFRB, broadcasts at a frequency of 6.07 MHz and is operated on the north end of the same site beside the main building. CFRB was one of few to broadcast in AM stereo, starting in 1984. However, since AM stereo never achieved wide acceptance, the station deactivated its stereo broadcasting system in the mid-1990s. The transmitter is located on Royal Windsor Drive, 200 meters west of the intersection of Lakeshore Road West (former King's Highway 2) and Southdown Road, in the Clarkson area of Mississauga, Ontario, Canada at the coordinates . Programming In early 2007, CFRB reported an increase in ratings since programming changes such as Bill Carroll's assumption of morning show duties from Ted Woloshyn. However, CFRB's morning show has trailed CBC Radio One's Metro Morning since 2003.Renhart, Anthony, \\"Andy Barrie battles Parkinson's; Popular CBC radio host comes out 'as a guy with a disability'\\", Globe and Mail, June 29, 2007\\"Metro Morning rated top morning show\\", Globe and Mail, December 11, 2003 In August 2009, CFRB announced it was laying off a number of its well-known personalities, including Michael Coren, Paul and Carol Mott, Christina Cherneskey, Jacqui Delaney and newscaster Kris McCusker as part of a move to open a \\"new chapter\\" at the station. Newstalk 1010's Justine Lewkowicz at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival premiere of Seven Psychopaths The second phase of the shake up was announced in the fall with John Moore moving from afternoon drive to morning, replacing Bill Carroll, who moved to the 9 am to 1 pm slot. Jim Richards took over the 1pm to 4pm slot formerly held by The Motts and Michael Coren and former Ontario Progressive Conservative leader John Tory (later mayor of Toronto) took over the late afternoon slot vacated by Moore. In 2010, Carroll left CFRB to take a job in Los Angeles and was replaced by Jerry Agar. Prior to July 2010, CFRB's talk schedule was unlike most private talk radio stations in Canada, in that even in overnights and weekends, it was entirely Canadian, and had no American syndicated programming on its schedule at all. That changed when CFRB added the American-based comedy-talk show The Phil Hendrie Show for overnights. On the weekend of October 2‚Äì3, 2010, a new weekend schedule was revealed which included The Morning Show with Ben Mercer, Saturdays with Ted Woloshyn, Sports Talk with Mike Toth and Sundays with John Downs. As a result, many long running shows were cut, including Tech Talk with Marc Saltzman, Car Talk with Alan Gelman, The Dr. Joe Show, The Spider Jones Show, The Dr. Micky Lester Show and The Morning Show with John Donabie. In early 2013, the station added Astral's new late night Humble & Fred show.\\"Humble And Fred Return To Radio Via Astral Media, CFRB\\". Mediabase, January 14, 2013. Josh Matlow started on Newstalk 1010 contributing to Sundays with John Downs and then began hosting his own show, \\"The City\\" (beginning in August 2011) every Sunday on Newstalk 1010 between 1-3PM. Matlow discussed city hall's top headlines with Toronto's city councillors and the week's news makers. From February 2012 until November 2013, CFRB aired The City, featuring Toronto Mayor Rob Ford and his brother and city councillor Doug Ford. The Ford brothers' version of the show was often controversial and was allegedly used by the Fords as a platform to attack their political enemies, prompting various complaints. The show was cancelled in November 2013 after Mayor Ford admitted using crack cocaine after several months of denials.
