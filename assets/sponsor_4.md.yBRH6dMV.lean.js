Microchess, as small as it was in terms of program size, could still play passable chess on the KIM-1 with its 6502 microprocessor, 1 kilobyte of memory, simple hex keyboard, and seven-segment display. Selling it at a price of US$10, Jennings refused to sell the rights of the program to Chuck Peddle (president of MOS Technology) for $1000. It was the first software package to sell 50,000 copies. Jennings founded Personal Software to publish Microchess to the nascent microcomputer market. Money made from Microchess and other software projects allowed Jennings, together with Dan Fylstra, to launch VisiCorp company, and underwrite the development of VisiCalc, the first spreadsheet. Microchess was later expanded into a more fully featured program with graphics for the TRS-80, Apple II, Commodore PET and Atari 8-bit family computers. It was also licensed to Novag for its dedicated Chess Champion Mk II in 1979. Reception BYTE in 1981 stated that when chess programs such as Microchess appeared, \\"we all laughed and proceeded to demolish them ... microcomputer chess programs had a poor reputation\\".

System Features  Data Format --- MapInfo Pro is a database which manages information as a system of Tables. Each table is either a map file (graph) or a database file (text) and is denoted the file extension .TAB. MapInfo creates a visual display of the data in the form of a map (map window) and/or tabular form (browser window). Once data has been referenced in a table it is assigned X and Y coordinates so that the records can be displayed as objects on a map. This is known as Geocoding. Objects (points, lines, polygons) can be enhanced to highlight specific variations on a theme through the creation of a Thematic map. The basic data is overlaid with graphic styles (e.g. colour shades, hatch patterns) to display information on a more sophisticated level. For example, population density between urban and rural areas may show the cities in deep red (to indicate a high ratio of inhabitants per square mile), while showing remote areas in very pale red (to indicate a low concentration of inhabitants). Retrieval of information is conducted using data filters and \\"Query\\" functions . Selecting an object in a map window or records in a browser produces a temporary table that provides a range of values specified by the end-user. More advanced \\"Structured Query Language\\" (SQL) analysis allows the user to combine a variety of operations to derive answers to complex questions. This may involve a combination of tables and resultant calculations may be such as the number of points in polygons, proportional overlaps, and statistical breakdowns. The quantity and quality of the attributes associated with objects are dependent on the structure of the original tables. Vector analysis is a primary function of MapInfo based on X, Y coordinates and the user can create and edit data directly with commands such as: node editing, combine, split, erase, buffer, clip region. MapInfo Pro includes a range of engineering ‚ÄúCAD like‚Äù drawing and editing tools such as lines, circles, and polygons (referred to as \\"regions\\") which can be incorporated into tables or drawn as temporary overlays. Printout of MapInfo maps and/or statistics is managed through design settings in the Layout Window. Layout design enables the creation of composite presentations with maps, tables, legends, text, images, lines and shapes. Output hardware includes large format plotters and high spec. business printers. Data from MapInfo may be embedded into applications such as Microsoft PowerPoint or Word using copy/paste commands and resized as required. Compatibility with External Software Systems --- MapInfo Pro can read and write other file formats for data exchange with applications such as: * ESRI Shapefile and AutoCAD DXF * CSV and delimited ASCII text * Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Access * Bitmaps or Raster Formats such as GeoTIFF, ECW, Mr. SID, JPEG, PNG, MRR * Spatial Databases: Oracle, PostGIS, SQL Server, SQLite and GeoPackage * Open Geospatial Consortium Web Services: Web Feature Service, Web Map Service, Catalog Service for the Web * Web Base Maps: Bing, Open StreetMap (OSM)  Historical Notes  With MapInfo Professional, the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) created hundreds of maps for the longest torch relay in the history of the modern games. The Olympic Torch Relay covered 26,940 kilometres (16,740 miles) in 100 days and traversed Australia by road, railway and boat. The torch route was designed to ensure that more than 85 percent of the Australian population was within a one-hour drive of the chosen route, which passed through 1,000 towns. In addition, TNT Express used MapInfo to map more than 5,500 delivery routes to deliver Olympic tickets to more than 400,000 Australian homes.

A society was formed in 1867 to try to improve the breed, and the first register of Pembroke cattle was published in 1874 . Pembroke cattle were registered with black cattle from North Wales in 1904, to create the Welsh Black breed. Characteristics Pembroke cattle were described as being coal black.C. S.

The horns which at first incline outwards and forwards, and then bend somewhat upwards and inwards, are light coloured with black tips. They were reported to be good milk producers, with many being sold to London town dairies. Historically they were well regarded for their suitability for droving to England for sale to Graziers. Store cattle of the breed were favoured for grazing in Sussex and Kent, especially on the Pevensey Levels,J. Bannister. A synopsis of husbandry, I799, p. 47 and many also went to the English Midlands. History The ancient breed was indigenous to the old Welsh counties of Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire, and South Cardiganshire. There were distinct strains in the Castlemartin area of South Pembrokeshire and the Dewsland area of north Pembrokeshire. These cattle were locally regarded as hardier on the poor land than English dairy breeds such as the Shorthorn. Both types were later amalgamated into the Welsh Black breed for which a herdbook was opened in 1874. By the end of the 19th century some 25,000 black cattle from South Wales were being sold to England annually. References *Twm Elias, Welsh Farm Animals 1: Cattle, Gwasg Carreg Gwalch, 2000.

It runs for 52.9 miles (85.1 km) from Wanette, Oklahoma to Wellston, Oklahoma. It has no lettered spur routes. SH-102 traces its origins to a spur route from SH-39 to Wanette that was added to the highway system in 1955. This highway was gradually extended bit by bit before reaching its present extent in 1977. Route description SH-102 just north of SH-59B. SH-102 begins in downtown Wanette and heads northward to meet State Highway 39, which it very briefly overlaps. After splitting off, it heads due north to Tribbey. Two miles north of Tribbey, it meets the western terminus of SH-59B, west of Macomb. Eight miles later, it crosses State Highway 9 east of Pink. It provides access to the Shawnee Reservoir before meeting Interstate 40. SH-102's northern end near Wellston SH-102 merges into Interstate 40 at Exit 178 (Dale/Bethel Acres) and splits at Exit 176 (McLoud Rd.). Between these two exits, SH-102 overlaps Interstate 40, US-270, and State Highway 3. After splitting off, it heads northward to meet State Highway 270 in McLoud, which it briefly overlaps. After splitting off in downtown McLoud, it heads northward to cross into Lincoln County. It crosses over Interstate 44 (the Turner Turnpike) with no interchange. The highway ends near Wellston at State Highway 66. History State Highway 102 was first commissioned on May 2, 1955, as a spur route connecting Wanette to SH-39. A second segment of SH-102, extending from SH-9 west of Tecumseh to US-270 (present-day SH-270) between McLoud and Dale, was added on October 6, 1958. This situation‚Äîone short SH-102 spur to Wanette and a longer SH-102 from SH-9 to Dale‚Äîwould persist for the next thirteen years. The two sections of SH-102 were finally united during the 1970s. On May 10, 1971, the highway was extended south from SH-9 to SH-39 and joined to the Wanette spur by means of a concurrency. Two further changes to the highway occurred during 1977. The highway was extended north, first to US-62 at Midway, on June 6 of that year. Later, on August 1, the highway was extended further, bringing it to US-66 near Wellston. SH-102 was briefly extended to SH-66B when work on what was by then SH-66 caused its traffic to be detoured onto SH-66B. After the work was completed, SH-102 was truncated back to SH-66, though the connector road still exists and remains open to traffic. Prior to 2007, the bridge over I-44 was only one lane wide. This bridge was demolished and replaced, necessitating a detour along U.S. Highway 177, which parallels the route. I-44 was also reduced to two lanes during the rebuild. SH-102 now crosses the turnpike on a modern two-lane bridge.

She had a mixed cargo including copper and silver ingots. The wreck was recorded historically, because the salvage of the cargo was the subject of an international dispute that led to a Court of Star Chamber, but the location of the wreck was unknown until 1981. The wreck is designated under the Protection of Wrecks Act.Advisory Committee on Historic Wrecks Report for 2005The wreck is a Protected Wreck managed by Ship St Anthony was the personal property of King John III of Portugal and the flagship of his fleet. She was a carrack; these were largest ships of the time and the first truly oceangoing vessels. The cargo was particularly valuable, estimated to be worth at the time ¬£18,800 (about 4,000 times a man's annual wage), and it is thought to have included the dowry of Princess Catherine, bride of King John III and sister of Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor.Pengersick castle The cargo manifest survives. Wrecking and salvage The wreck occurred on 15 January 1527 in a storm described, in contemporary evidence, as great and urgent tempest of winds and weather and by the great outrages of the sea.Randall, Tony, \\"A Castle and a Carrack\\" in Nautical Archaeology, the newsletter of the Nautical Archaeology Society, 2005.3 pp. 7, 8 There were 45 survivors from a crew of 86. On the morning after the wreck, the winds receded, and at low tide the wreck was in just six feet of water. Both the survivors and the local people attempted to salvage property from the wreck. King John III of Portugal, demanded the return of the cargo, and King Henry VIII set up a Court of Star Chamber. Some of the evidence that was given at the court survives, but not the outcome. However manorial rights of the time would have included an assumed right to goods from wrecks on manorial lands and three prominent landowners were able to improve their status and their manors in the years that followed. William Godolphin was knighted and Godolphin house was considerably improved. St Aubyn of St Michael's Mount was a Justice of the Peace. John Milliton of Pengersick Castle became High Sheriff of Cornwall and Pengersick Castle was also improved around this time. There is some evidence that Henry VIII ordered that the salvaged cargo should be returned to Portugal, but much of it was missing. Discovery and protection Despite the existence of the historical records, the actual position of the wreck was unknown. In the 1970s a copper ingot was recovered by a shellfish diver, but the significance of this find was not understood until 1981, when a copper ingot was found on the beach. A team was sent to investigate and discovered that the location matched the contemporary accounts. The seabed at this location consists of rocky gullies, exposed to the full force of Atlantic surf. There is no sediment to protect historic material and there are flint pebbles which help to smash and grind artefacts. Unsurpisingly therefore, the timbers of the ship have not survived, nor have any ferrous artefacts. The site was designated on 15 February 1982 under the Protection of Wrecks Act and local diver Tony Randall was made licensee. As conservation in situ was impossible, a license to conduct a rescue operation of any surviving artefacts was granted, and the surviving remains were recovered. Examples of copper and silver ingots were acquired and analysed by the British MuseumFenwick, Valerie and Gale, Alison (1998), \\"Historic Shipwrecks, Discovered, Protected and Investigated\\", pp. 50‚Äì51, Tempus Publishing Limited, . There are public displays of recovered artefacts at Charlestown Heritage and Shipwreck CentreCharlestown Shipwreck & Heritage Centre and at Pengersick Castle.

Schramm was a Chair and Professor of History at the University of G√∂ttingen from 1929 to 1963.  Early life and education  Schramm was born to a wealthy and cosmopolitan family in Hamburg, that belonged to the class of Hanseatic families. His father, Max Schramm, was a lawyer, senator and second mayor (i.e. deputy mayor) from 1925 to 1928. His grandfather Ernst Schramm (1812‚Äì1882) had been a major sugar merchant in Hamburg and Brazil. His mother Olga O'Swald, grandniece of William Henry O'Swald, also belonged to a prominent Hanseatic family.http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz73980.html The young Percy served in the German Army during World War I and went on to study history and art history at several of Germany's elite universities, including Hamburg, Munich and Heidelberg. In 1922, he completed his doctoral studies at the University of Heidelberg under the medieval historian Karl Hampe. He remained at Heidelberg for two more years to write his Habilitationsschrift on the topic of German imperial ideology in the tenth and eleventh centuries, and in particular, how the Holy Roman emperors of the medieval period appropriated the imagery and history of the ancient Roman Empire for their own rule. Published in 1929 as Kaiser, Rom und Renovatio: Studien und Texte zur Geschichte des r√∂mischen Erneuerungsgedankens vom Ende des karolingischen Reiches biz zum Investiturstreit (\\"Emperor, Rome and Renovatio: Studies and Texts on the History of Roman Ideologies of Renewal from the End of the Carolingian Empire to the Investiture Controversy\\"), Schramm's thesis was a landmark piece of highly original, interdisciplinary scholarship that transformed the way medieval historians approached the subject of political ideology. He demonstrated that art history, a field of study which at the time fell mostly to dilettantes and gentleman scholars, deserved a place in serious academic inquiry alongside history and philology. Schramm's work also emphasized the centrality of symbols and ritual in articulating and defining political ideologies. In a rite of passage required of most German medievalists at the time, Schramm worked for two years at the Monumenta Germaniae Historica before being offered a professorship. In 1929, he was awarded a chair in history at the University of G√∂ttingen, one of Germany's most prestigious universities. His students at G√∂ttingen included Berent Schwinek√∂per; the American professor of German History, Donald Detwiler; and the Hungarian medievalist, J√°nos Bak. Schramm remained there until his retirement in 1963. In Spring 1932, Schramm spoke publicly in Thalburg on behalf of the re-election of Paul von Hindenburg, who was running against Adolf Hitler for the Presidency of the Weimar Republic. Speaking fluent English, Schramm received an invitation to teach at Princeton University during the 1933 academic year; he returned to G√∂ttingen in that same year, after Hindenburg had appointed Hitler to be Chancellor of Germany.  Second World War  During World War II, Schramm volunteered again for service in the Wehrmacht and, given the rank of major, served in various staff positions until he was selected as the official staff historian, or diarist, for the German High Command Operational Staff (Wehrmachtf√ºhrungsstab), replacing Helmuth Greiner, whose removal was orchestrated by Martin Bormann, the head of the Nazi Party chancellery.Detwiler, Donald S. (1978) \\"Introduction\\" to Schramm, Percy Ernst Hitler: The Man and the Military Leader. Malabar, Florida: Robert E. Kreiger Publishing Company. pp.4‚Äì6 Schramm's duties involved keeping detailed records about the day-to-day activities and decisions of the General Staff, which included the top military field commanders in the German Army. This allowed Schramm unprecedented access to the highest echelons of the German military and its inner workings. In 1944, Schramm's sister-in-law was executed because of her active opposition to the Nazi regime, and accusations against Schramm himself, doubting his reliability, became known to Hitler's headquarters. However, these were ignored by General Alfred Jodl, Schramm's superior, and the historian was able to continue in his role as war diarist. Because of his knowledge of the High Command, Schramm was called as a key witness at the Nuremberg Trials after the war, where he testified on behalf of Jodl. Schramm maintained that Jodl, while a loyal soldier, was not an ideological Nazi and did not participate in any war crimes. Nonetheless, Jodl was convicted and hanged in 1946.Jodl was posthumously acquitted in 1953 by a German denazification court. In the years after the war, Schramm authored a number of books on the history of the German military, as well as in-depth accounts of the desperate last days of the Third Reich as seen from inside the military command. Schramm's work in this field, particularly his multi-volume edition of the official diaries of the High Command, is still highly valued by military historians. Schramm was able, along with three of his former students, then professors themselves,Schramm's three ex-students were Professors Hans-Adolf Jacobsen, Andreas Hillgruber, and Walther Hubatsch.

Kreiger Publishing Company. p.6 to re-assemble the diary from copies he had saved in defiance of Hitler's scorched earth orders, combined with copies of diaries of earlier years which had been saved by Greiner, his predecessor as war diarist. In 1962, Schramm published to some controversy a study of Adolf Hitler as a military commander (Hitler als milit√§rischer F√ºhrer). Schramm was able to observe Hitler during the course of his duties, and he contrasted the patriotism and professionalism of the generals he served under with Hitler's irrationality and growing paranoia as the war took a turn for the worse. Schramm also published, in 1963, an introduction to Henry Picker's Hitlers Tischgespr√§che (Hitler's Table Talk) entitled \\"The Anatomy of a Dictator\\", which was later published in English together with the earlier essay on Hitler's as a military leader as Hitler: The Man and the Military Leader Whatever the merits of his other work, the essay on Hitler's personality provoked some criticism in the German press at the time, where Schramm was accused of being an apologist for National Socialism. In a series of lectures one year later at the University of Munich, during the summer term of 1964, the political philosopher and philosopher of history Eric Voegelin dismissed these charges; the lectures were later translated and published under the title of Hitler and the Germans. Voegelin argued at length, based on a close reading of Schramm's text and comparing it unfavourably with Alan Bullock's analysis, that Schramm gave no insight into 'the problem of Hitler', and that this was in any case an 'alibi' for the real problem. The real problem, Voegelin stated, drawing on classical thinkers from Plato to Schelling, as well as from contemporary German writers such as Carl Amery Capitulation: The Lesson of German Catholicism and Robert Musil On Stupidity) was the way that German Anstand bourgeois morality had rendered many, but not all, of the German population spiritually blind and effectively stupid, a state of affairs that had been allowed to persist until the present day. Schramm himself, Voegelin argued quite carefully, was, in a similar sense, stupid.  Post-war career  Because he had been a member of the Nazi Party and served in a relatively high position in the army during the war, Schramm was removed from his university post. As denazification waned in the late 1940s, however, he was rehabilitated and returned to his professorship in G√∂ttingen. Between 1954 and 1956, he produced what was perhaps his second most significant work, after Kaiser Rom und Renovatio, titled Herrschaftszeichen und Staatssymbolik (Signs of Authority and the Symbolism of the State). Herrschaftszeichen was a major survey of the representative art of medieval rulers or symbols of their power, including their regalia, seals, coinage, armaments, clothing, and other objects. These objects and their history were catalogued in more detail in a book Schramm authored together with the eminent art historian Florentine M√ºtherich, Denkmale der deutschen K√∂nige und Kaiser (\\"Monuments of the German Kings and Emperors\\", 1962). The enduring legacy of Schramm's work in these and numerous other studies and articles, was to demonstrate the importance of symbols, liturgical ceremony, gestures and images as critical sources for political history. Along with his contemporaries, Ernst H. Kantorowicz and Carl Erdmann, Schramm introduced an important element of cultural history to a field which (especially in Germany) tended to focus largely on institutions and their texts. In 1958, Schramm was inducted into the Order Pour le M√©rite, an award recognizing his contributions to the arts and sciences in Germany. In 1964, a Festschrift devoted to Schramm was published.Classen, P and Scheibert, P (1964) Festschrift Percy Ernst Schramm, Band I and II, Franz Steiner Verlag. He died in 1970 in G√∂ttingen.

She is the youngest daughter of Ernest V. \\"Pop\\" Stoneman, patriarch of the Stoneman Family, one of the most famous family groups in early country music. Roni is the youngest daughter and second youngest of Stoneman's 23 children, and one of only 13 who survived to adulthood. Early life Fourteen years before Roni was born, her father, Ernest \\"Pop\\" Stoneman, was one of the first ever country musicians to make a career out of recording country music, initially culminating in his hit 1924 song \\"The Sinking of the Titanic\\", which became the first-ever million-selling country music record. Stoneman enjoyed a lucrative career until he lost everything during the Great Depression. It wasn't until 1956 after a winning appearance on a quiz show that Pop resumed his music career, starting a family band with his wife Hattie and some of their children. Roni had learned to play banjo at a young age and in 1957 joined her family in the band. They won on Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts and made many appearances on other TV shows of the day. The Stonemans became a very popular touring act, performing at the White House, the Smithsonian, and in 1962 on the Grand Ole Opry. They even hosted their own TV series, Those Stonemans, from 1966 to 1968, during which time they won the CMA's \\"Vocal Group of the Year\\" award in 1967.https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-stoneman-family- mn0000475313/biography Stoneman Family Bio from Allmusic.com Solo career After Pop's death in 1968, Roni, then thirty and already a virtuoso banjo player, decided to pursue a solo career. She eventually reached a much wider audience in the 70s when she joined the cast of the very popular country music show Hee Haw. But while she occasionally picked banjo and sang on the show, it was her comedic talents that garnered more attention; her most prominent character was that of Ida Lee Nagger, which she initially performed in brief sketches with castmate Gordie Tapp as her husband LaVern. Roni became so identified with the character of Ida Lee that she would also do other skits in character, including the classic \\"Pfft! You Were Gone!\\" song. Later in the series run, Ida Lee had adopted a Sadie Hawkins-style persona of a homely spinster, particularly in Hee Haws \\"Honky Tonk\\" sketch, during which she would be chasing numerous men around wielding a large butterfly net. Roni continues to entertain at numerous state and county fairs each year, and recent appearances include the UCLA Folk Festival, the Florida State Fair and the International Sport Show in Canada. She and her older sister Donna are the last two surviving members of the Stoneman Family.

The origin of the town's name has two possible sources. The first is that it is a derivative of the Anglo-Saxon Alfreinscoma - by which name it was noted in the Liber Exoniensis of 1086. The translation of this name (from Walter William Skeat of the department of Anglo Saxon at Cambridge University) means the \\"Valley of the sons of Alfred\\". The second origin is that the name Ilfracombe was derived from Norse illf (bad), Anglo- Saxon yfel (evil ford) and Old English cumb (valley or bottom) from Cornish komm, Welsh cwm, thus 'The valley with the bad ford'. The manor house at Chambercombe in east Ilfracombe was recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book as being built by a Norman knight Champernon (from Chambernon in France) who landed with William of Normandy. It is also said to be haunted.The Legend of Chambercombe Manor Ilfracombe comprised two distinct communities; a farming community around the parish church called Holy Trinity, parts of which date from the 12th century, and a fishing community around the natural harbour formed between Capstone, Compass and Lantern Torrs. It is recorded that the lands by the church were part of the estate owned by Champernowne family, while those by the harbour belonged to the Bouchier family: Earls of Bath. Because of the natural layout of the harbour, Ilfracombe became a significant safe port (registered port of refuge) on the Bristol Channel. It also had trade routes between Kinsale and Tenby, which made the port stronger. In 1208 it was listed as having provided King John with ships and men to invade Ireland; in 1247 it supplied a ship to the fleet that was sent to conquer the Western Isles of Scotland; 6 ships, with 79 men were sent to support the siege of Calais. Ilfracombe was the last disembarkation point for two large forces sent to subdue the Irish. The building which sits on Lantern Hill by the harbour, known as St Nicholas's Chapel (built 1361) is reputed to be the oldest working lighthouse in the UK; a light/beacon has been there for over 650 years. The town was also home to the Bowen family. James Bowen was master of HMS Queen Charlotte, the flagship of Richard, Earl Howe at the 1794 \\"Glorious First of June\\" battle. James Bowen was commissioned by Howe for his leadership in the battle, he rose through the levels - commander of the Argot, the Dreadnought, and in Georgian England titled \\"defender of Madeira\\", led the fleet which rescued the British army at Corunna in the Peninsula war, and retired as a Rear Admiral, Commissioner of the Royal Navy. Captain Richard Bowen (1761‚Äì1797) James Bowen's younger brother, a British naval commander on the ship HMS Terpsichore, served under Lord Nelson, and was killed at the battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. John Bowen (1780‚Äì1827), son of James Bowen, a naval officer and colonial administrator founded the first settlement of Tasmania at Risdon Cove in 1803 - the settlement which later became known as Hobart.Bowen's Hobart : The Beginnings of European Settlement in Tasmania Lieutenant A E Down, was initially posted to Ilfracombe to lead a protection ship for the customs and excise, he married a local girl, rose through the levels to retire as vice Admiral, his son joined the navy aged 14 (his first navy kit is on display at National Maritime Museum Greenwich). In 1802 James Meek married Down's daughter and settled in the town, James Meek was appointed the Comptroller of Victuals to the Royal Navy in 1832, he was knighted, and died in Ilfracombe 1852. (gentlemen's gazette) There was a wooden fortress overlooking the harbour, of this nothing remains except contemporary records and the area designated Castle Hill off Portland Street/Montepellier Terrace. Photochrom of Ilfracombe, 1890s The novelist Fanny Burney stayed in Ilfracombe in 1817. Her diary entries (31 July ‚Äì 5 October) record early 19th century life in Ilfracombe: a captured Spanish ship; two ships in distress in a storm; the visit of Thomas Bowdler; and her lucky escape after being cut off by the tide. A few years later in the 1820s a set of four tunnels were hand carved by Welsh miners to permit access to the beaches by horse-drawn carriage as well as by foot. Previously access was gained by climbing the cliffs, rounding the point by boat, swimming or at the lowest tides clambering around the rocks of the point. These tunnels led to a pair of tidal pools, which in accordance with Victorian morals, were used for segregated male and female bathing. Whereas women were constrained to a strict dress code covering up the whole body, men generally swam naked. The tunnels are still viewable and are signposted as Tunnels Beaches. In 1856 writer Mary Ann Evans (pen-name George Eliot) accompanied George Henry Lewes to Ilfracombe to gather materials for his work Seaside Studies published in 1858. In 1911, the Irish nationalist Anna Catherine Parnell (sister of Charles Stewart Parnell) drowned at Ilfracombe. Miss Alice Frances Louisa Phillips (b. 26 January 1891 at 85 High Street, Ilfracombe) and her father Mr Escott Robert Phillips (b. 1869 Cardiff) held 2nd Class Ticket #2 on , and set sail from Southampton on 10 April 1912 heading for New Brighton, Pennsylvania. Alice was rescued in boat 12, her father was lost in the disaster. Until the mid-19th century Ilfracombe's economy was based around maritime activities: importing lime and coal from Wales; fishing for herring; and international trade, including to West Africa and the West Indies. In George III and the Regency period the town was home to many navy personnel ‚Äì four admirals, numerous captains, and other commissioned and non-commissioned sailors.  Railway  From 1874, Ilfracombe was served by the Ilfracombe railway line that ran from Barnstaple, but this closed in 1970.  Tourism  The town gradually developed into a tourist resort served by ferries along the Bristol Channel. The opening of the railway accelerated this development. The population grew until the First World War, then stabilised at 9,200. During the boom times of tourism in the 1950s there was not a large enough local workforce to service the needs of the tourism industry during the summer months. Many local businesses advertised in Northern cities such Manchester and Liverpool to alleviate this problem. This 'inward migration' caused social problems and friction between these people and those with a long history of residence. At its peak over 10,000 holidaymakers used the railway each Saturday during peak season, and passenger ferries brought still more. When the tourism market faltered with the arrival of cheap foreign package holidays in the 1960s, and the closure of the railway, unemployment levels rose.  Ferry  Harbour The first steam packets arrived at Ilfracombe in 1823, and soon a regular service between Bristol and between Swansea developed. On 16 May 1873, a wooden promenade pier was opened to allow the pleasure steamers to berth at all tides. On 23 June 1894, it was reported in the Ilfracombe Chronicle that over 2,500 people arrived in no less than seven boats, it describes them as 'commodious and well-appointed vessels with an excellent reputation for speed and comfort.' As well as holidaymakers, the boats carried workers, live and dead stock, and other merchandise to and from the town. The PS Waverley first arrived in Ilfracombe in 1887, after her owners Messrs P. and A. Campbell brought her to Bristol as their first pleasure steamer to work the Bristol Channel. Deterioration of the wooden pier and part demolition during World War II mean that a new pier was required. The wood was replaced with reinforced concrete and car parking space was increased. The new pier was opened on 6 July 1952.  Lifeboat  The town's first lifeboat was bought in 1828 but a permanent service was not available until the Royal National Lifeboat Institution built a lifeboat station at the bottom of Lantern Hill near the pier in 1866. The present station at Broad Street dates from 1996.  Ilfracombe's Fires  The Great Fire of Ilfracombe started at 12:40 am on the night of 28 July 1896 in the basement of Mr William Cole's ironmongers and furniture shop on the corner of Portland Street and Fore Street. The local volunteer fire brigade had it under control by the following morning. The firebrigade's entire equipment was a manual Merryweather engine, a hose-reel cart and one telescopic ladder on wheels. In total thirty five houses and business premises and their contents were destroyed. Later that year the fire brigade crew were presented with medals and ¬£2 each at a dinner in their honour at the Royal Clarence Hotel. The damage was estimated at the time at between ¬£80,000 and ¬£100,000. The same area of the town was struck by fire twice during the 1980s. First on 12 December 1981 Draper's paint store in the upper story of the building on the corner of Portland Street and Fore Street, this fire was contained quickly, however fumes from the burning paint meant much of the local area was evacuated during the night. The second much larger fire started at 2:30am on the night of 2 September 1983 in the shopping arcade under the Candar hotel. In this fire one life was lost. Both of these fires drew parallels to the Great Fire in the media of the time. The Candar Arcade site became the Candar sheltered residential apartments. The opening of Candar apartments was the last public engagement performed by Charles and Diana, as the Prince and Princess of Wales in 1992. Other fires in Ilfracombe include: On 17 May 1985 the Beacon Castle was devastated by fire. On the 5 August 1991 the Mount Hotel was destroyed by fire. On 24 January 2001 the Hotel Cecil; 14 January 2004 the arcade on the seafront near Susan Day Residential Home was destroyed by fire. On 17 November 2004 and 13 February 2005 the Cliffe Hydro suffered from fires. Shortly before 19:00 BST on Wednesday, 8 August 2006, a fire broke out at the derelict Montebello Hotel in Fore Street, Ilfracombe. Twenty fire engines were required to put out the blaze including a number rushed to the scene from Woolacombe, Barnstaple and the bordering county of Somerset. Specialist equipment was brought in from as far afield as Exeter, and according to the local radio news 85 firemen were involved at the fire. The fire spread to three neighbouring properties and showered debris over a wide area. The six- storey hotel was completely gutted, with only the front wall, chimney stacks and remains of the lift shaft frame surviving the blaze, and the fire was still being damped-down the following day. Fore Street was closed for some period due to the difficulties of demolition.Initial report of the fire from BBC News The building was eventually demolished when it was determined that the fire had left it structurally unsound. This caused additional headaches for the emergency services as curious members of the public ignored safety barriers in an attempt to see the remains more clearly. The site is to be redeveloped as residential accommodation, although, as of November 2013, no work has been started on the site. This history of Ilfracombe's large fires has to be taken in the context of the number, size, and antiquity of many early Victorian jerry built hotels. A comprehensive display in the museum shows whilst the size of buildings may be large, the frequency of such conflagrations is comparatively low and the justification as to why Devon and Somerset fire and rescue authority transferred the large extension ladder from the Ilfracombe station to Barnstaple.

Sharhorod was established as a city under Magdeburg law in 1588. In the seventeenth century, because of its location along wine and cattle trading routes, Sharhorod emerged as one of the largest towns in Podolia. The Turks occupied Sharhorod between 1672 and 1699, when the town was called \\"Little Istanbul\\". During that time the synagogue was converted into a mosque. In the nineteenth century, the town became a center of Jewish Hasidism.Veidlinger, Jeffrey, \\"In the Shadow of the Shtetl: Small Town Jewish Life in Soviet Ukraine\\", Indiana University Press, 2013 p.28 Rabbi Jacob Joseph of Polonne fled to Ra≈ücov as a result of being exiled from Sharhorod.

Kearney was a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, popularly known as the Fenians. He wrote the song about the time of the Fenian Rising of 1867http://www.countysongs.ie/song/?songtheme=Fenian%20Rising. It evokes the memory of the freedom-fighters of the previous generation (strong, manly forms...eyes with hope gleaming), as recalled by an old woman down by the glenside. It is effectively a call to arms for a generation of Irishmen accustomed to political nationalism. Versions Three verses to this song were sung by Ken Curtis and The Sons of the Pioneers in the 1950 John Ford movie Rio Grande, though the film was set in the 19th Century Wild West. Richard Dyer-Bennet recorded the song on his first self produced LP Richard Dyer-Bennet 1, (1955). The song became popular again in the 1960s, when it was recorded by The Clancy Brothers. It has since been recorded by numerous artists, including The Dubliners, Cherish The Ladies, Omnia, Screaming Orphans, Jim McCann, Harry O'Donoghue, and The Wolfe Tones. The song is also sung in the first episode of the BBC series Days of Hope, written by Jim Allen and directed by Ken Loach. An Irish barmaid is forced to sing after being sexually harassed by British soldiers and impresses them with her song.

The key factor is that they were non-international and there is a significant difference between them and the official England cricket team which takes part in international fixtures. Conceptually, there is evidence of this sort of team being formed, or at least mooted, since the 1730s. They have always been \\"occasional elevens\\" but, nevertheless, have invariably been strong sides. A typical example would be a selection consisting of leading players drawn from several county teams. Origin of the name The earliest known mention of the concept occurs in a report by the London Evening Post of 7 to 9 September 1734 which states that the London Cricket Club, being \\"desirous of playing one more match before the season is expired, do challenge to play with any eleven men in England\\". The challenge excluded members of Croydon Cricket Club, with whom London were in dispute.Waghorn, p. 7. It is possible that challenges of this sort had been issued previously but no records of them have been found. There had been matches involving, for example, a team representing one county against a team bearing a patron's name and it is possible that teams of the latter type included players from a wide geographical area. In the 1730s, \\"any eleven men in England\\" would in practice have come from the southeastern counties only: e.g., Berkshire, Essex, Hampshire, Kent, Middlesex, Surrey, Sussex. The majority of such teams were simply labelled \\"England\\" and sometimes the term \\"all-England\\" was used loosely in a generic sense but, strictly speaking, the teams represented \\"the Rest of England\\". The \\"all England\\" term per se was first used in reports of two Kent v England matches in 1739. The first was at Bromley Common on Monday, 9 July, and billed as \\"eleven gentlemen of that county (i.e., Kent) and eleven gentlemen from any part of England, exclusive of Kent\\". Kent, described as \\"the unconquerable county\\", won by \\"a very few notches\\".Waghorn, pp. 22‚Äì23. The second match was at the Artillery Ground in Bunhill Fields, Finsbury on Monday, 23 July. This game was drawn and a report includes the phrase \\"eleven picked out of all (sic) England\\". Top-level cricket at that time, however, was limited to the southeastern counties. Before these matches, there were instances of teams representing a number of counties. On Thursday, 28 August 1729, a match between Edwin Stead's XI and Sir William Gage's XI was held at Penshurst Park, near Tunbridge Wells in Kent. The match had the alternative title of Kent (Stead) v Surrey, Sussex & Hampshire (Gage). It was 11-a-side and played for 100 guineas with some thousands watching. It seems to have been the first known innings victory as Gage \\"got (within three) in one hand, as the former did in two hands, so the Kentish men (i.e., Stead's team) threw it up\\". A contemporary report states that \\"(Thomas Waymark) turned the scale of victory, which for some years past has been generally on the Kentish side\\". Given a 1728 reference to the superiority of Kent in the 1720s, it would seem that only a team representing three other counties had the strength to compete against them. Generic usage After 1739, \\"England\\" (or \\"all-England\\") became a generic term used to denote numerous teams over the next two hundred years. They invariably have important match status, depending on the quality and/or status of their opponents. Sometimes, the all-England teams were given names like \\"The Rest\\", which more accurately describes them vis-√†-vis their opponents.CricketArchive ‚Äì general matches played by \\"England\\" teams since 1739.

The name \\"All-England\\" took on a specific meaning in 1846 when William Clarke's All-England Eleven, commonly known as the AEE, was founded as a touring team of leading players, its purpose being to take advantage of the new railway network and play matches at city venues, mainly in the North of England. Clarke's team was indeed a top-class side worthy of its title as, in 1846, it consisted of himself, Joe Guy (cricketer), George Parr (all of Nottinghamshire), William Lillywhite, Jemmy Dean (both Sussex), William Denison, Will Martingell (both Surrey), Fuller Pilch, Alfred Mynn, Nicholas Wanostrocht (aka \\"Felix\\") and William Hillyer (all Kent). Their matches in Sheffield, Manchester and Leeds were a huge success and very profitable, especially for Clarke himself who was careful to pay his players more than Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) did (from ¬£4 to ¬£6 per week) and so keep them interested. He kept the surplus for himself. The AEE continued for several years to showcase the best players of the day. Subsequent additions to the squad included John Wisden of Sussex, William Dorrinton of Kent, Tom Sewell senior and his son Tom Sewell junior of Surrey. Because of its strength the AEE generally played \\"odds\\" matches against sides composed of twenty-two men, though these odds were reduced when opposed to such sides as Sheffield Cricket Club, Manchester Cricket Club and some county teams. The AEE lasted until 1880. In all matches George Parr with 10,404 runs (av 16.78) was the leading batsman for the side and William Clarke himself took the most wickets (2,385). United All-England Eleven (UEE) In 1852, several players set up the United All-England Eleven (UEE) as a rival to the AEE. Clarke would have nothing to do with the UEE but he died in 1856 and, from 1857 to 1866, matches were played between these two teams which were perhaps the most important contests of the English season ‚Äì certainly judged by the quality of the players. The AEE/UEE concept expanded with the formation of other itinerant elevens, notably the United North of England Eleven (UNEE) and the United South of England Eleven (USEE), the latter showcasing W. G. Grace. The travelling elevens ran their course over a period of some thirty seasons but interest in them waned as county cricket grew and provided matches with a more competitive edge. With the advent of international cricket in the 1870s, especially following the hugely successful inaugural Australian tour in 1878, the travelling elevens faded away. Non-international England teams Teams styled England and commonly referred to as all-England continued to play non- international matches into the 1880s but thereafter they tended to be given names such as The Rest because the England national team was by then well- established and understood to represent the country for the purpose of international cricket. The earliest match involving a team styled \\"The Rest of England\\" took place at Bradford Park Avenue in June 1883 when the opposition was a composite Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire XI. The combined counties won by 6 wickets.CricketArchive ‚Äì Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire v The Rest 1883. Retrieved on 9 January 2011. In the 20th century, Test trial matches were occasionally staged (the last in 1976) and these were called England v The Rest, but it is generally understood that the England of these games was the national side while The Rest formed the \\"all-England\\" element.

It is believed that his invasions also caused severe damage to the Buddhist faith in East India. Bakhtiyar also launched the Tibet campaign. He died in 1206 and was succeeded by Muhammad Shiran Khalji. Early life Bakhtiyar Khalji was born and raised in Garmsir, Helmand, in present-day southern Afghanistan. He was member of the Khalaj tribe,the Khiljƒ´ tribe had long been settled in what is now Afghanistan ... Khalji Dynasty. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2010. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 23 August 2010. a tribe of Turkic origin that after migration from Turkistan had settled in Afghanistan for over 200 years. He was head of the military force that conquered parts of eastern India at the end of the 12th century and at the beginning of the 13th century. Rise Tradition has it that Khalji's conquest of Bengal at the head of 18 horsemen was foretold. He was of common birth, had long arms extending below his knees, a short physical stature, and an unfavorable countenance. He was first appointed as the Dewan-i-Ard at Ghor. Then he approached India in about the year 1193 and tried to enter in the army of Qutb al-Din Aibak, but was refused rank. Then he went further eastward and took a job under Malik Hizbar al-Din, then in command of a platoon at Badayun in northern India. After a short period he went to Oudh where Malik Husam al-Din, recognised him for his worth. Husam gave him a landed estate in the south-eastern corner of modern Mirzapur district. Khalji soon established himself there and carried out successful raids into weakly-defended regions to the east. Conquests Khalji's career took a new turn when he subjugated Bihar in 1200. This effort earned him political clout in the court at Delhi. In the same year he took his forces into Bengal. As he came upon the city of Nabadwip, it is said that he advanced so rapidly that only 18 horsemen from his army could keep up. He conquered Nabadwip from the old emperor Lakshmana Sena in 1203.Retrieved: 11 January 2014 Subsequently, Khalji went on to capture the capital and the principal city, Gaur, and intruded into much of Bengal. Bakhtiyar Khalji's invasions are believed to have severely damaged the Buddhist establishments at Odantapuri, and Vikramashila which were thought to be fortifications by his army. Minhaj-i-Siraj's Tabaqat-i Nasiri suggests that Bakhtiyar Khalji destroyed a Buddhist monastery which the author equates in his description with a city he calls \\"Bihar\\", from what the soldiers learn is called a vihara. According to American scholar Hartmut Scharfe, the Tibetan sources suggest that this monastery was the one at Vikramashila; historian Andr√© Wink believes that this monastery must have been Odantapuri. According to the early 17th century Buddhist scholar Taranatha, the invaders massacred many monks at Odantapuri, and destroyed Vikramashila. The Tibetan pilgrim Dharmasvamin, who visited the region in the 13th century, states that Vikramashila had been completely razed to the ground by the Turushka (Turkic) invaders, and Nalanda was the residence of a Turushka military commander. Death and aftermath Ikhtiyar al-Dƒ´n Mu·∏•ammad Khalji left the town of Devkot in 1206 to attack Tibet, leaving Ali Mardan Khalji in Ghoraghat Upazila to watch the eastern frontier from his headquarters at Barisal. Khalji's forces suffered a disastrous defeat at the hands of Tibetan guerrilla forces at Chumbi Valley during his Tibetan expedition through an unfamiliar mountainous terrain, which forced him to retreat. Khalji then returned to Devkot with about one hundred surviving soldiers. Upon Ikhtiyar Khalji's return while he was lying ill at Devkot, he was assassinated by Ali Mardan. The Khalji noblemen then appointed Muhammad Shiran Khalji as Bakhtiyar's successor. Loyal troops under Shiran Khalji avenged Ikhtiyar's death, imprisoning Ali Mardan. Eventually Ali Mardan fled to Delhi and provoked the Sultan of Delhi Qutb al-Din Aibak to invade Bengal. Ali Mardan returned with the governor of Oudh, Kayemaz Rumi, and dethroned Shiran. Shiran fled to Dinajpur where he later died.Khilji Malik Ghiyas-ud-din Iwaz Khalji became the successor. Ali Mardan escaped and was made Governor of Bengal by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, but was killed in 1212. Ghiyas- ud-din again assumed power and proclaimed his independence. Legacy Al Mahmud, a leading Bangladeshi poet, composed a book of poetry titled Bakhtiyarer Ghora (Horses of Bakhtiyar) in the early 1990s. He depicted Khalji as the praiseworthy hero of Muslim conquest of Bengal. During Bakhtiyar Khalji's reign, Islam gained a large number of converts in India. Muhammad Bakhtiyar Khalji had the Khutbah read and coins struck in his own name. Mosques, madrasas, and khanqahs arose in the new abode of Islam through Bakhtiyar's patronage, and his example was imitated by his Amirs.

After about thirty years spent in the active life, he was in 1340 given permission to become a Carthusian, on the grounds that he felt a calling to the stricter life of silence and solitude practiced by that order;Charles Abbott Conway, The Vita Christi of Ludolph of Saxony and late medieval devotion centred on the incarnation: a descriptive analysis, (Salzburg, 1976), p1 in that year he entered the Charterhouse (Carthusian monastery) of Strasburg. Three years later he was called upon to govern the newly founded (1331) Charterhouse of Koblenz; but scruples of conscience led him to resign his office of prior in 1348. Having again become a simple monk, first at Mainz and afterwards at Strasburg, he spent the last thirty years of his life in retreat and prayer, and died on 13 April 1378 an octogenarian, universally esteemed for his sanctity, although he never seems to have been honoured with any public cult. Works Ludolph is principally remembered for two works: * A Commentary upon the Psalms, concise but excellent for its method, clearness and solidity. He especially developed the spiritual sense, according to the interpretations of St. Jerome, St. Augustine, Cassiodorus and Peter Lombard. This commentary, which was very popular in Germany in the Middle Ages, has passed through numerous editions, of which the first dates from 1491, and that of Montreuil-sur-Mer is from 1891. * The Vita Christi, his principal work, is not a simple biography, but a history, a commentary on the Gospels with large texts borrowed from the Fathers, a series of dogmatic and moral dissertations, of spiritual instructions, meditations and prayers, in relation to the life of Christ, from birth to His Ascension. It has been called a summa evangelica, so popular at that time, in which the author has condensed and resumed all that over sixty writers had said before him upon spiritual matters. It is possible that Ludolph also wrote the Speculum Humanae Salvationis.Adrian Wilson and Joyce Lancaster Wilson (1984), A Medieval Mirror, Berkeley: University of California Press, CDlib.org p.26-7. Other treatises and sermons now either lost or very doubtful have also been attributed to him. At times, the famous work The Imitation of Christ has been attributed to Ludolph of Saxony. Even though this is incorrect, it is certainly the case that the author of that work draws on Ludolph's thought.

Administratively, Mohyliv-Podilskyi is incorporated as a town of regional significance. It also serves as the administrative center of Mohyliv-Podilskyi Raion, one of twenty- seven districts of Vinnytsia Oblast, though it is not a part of the district. It is located in the historic region of Podolia, on the border with Bessarabia, Moldova, along the left bank of the Dniester river. On the opposite side of the river lies the Moldovan town of Otaci, and the two municipalities are connected to each other by a bridge. Population: History  Polish period  The first mention of the town dates from 1595. The owner of the town, Moldavian hospodar Ieremia MovilƒÉ bestowed it as a dowry gift to his daughter, who married into the Potocki family of Polish nobility. At that time, the groom named the town Movil«éu in honor of his father-in-law. In the first quarter of the 17th century, Mohyliv became one of the largest towns in Podolia. It was part of the Podolian Voivodeship of the Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown. It was a multi-ethnic border town composed of Poles, Greeks, Armenians, Serbs, Vlachs and Bosniaks.Geographical Dictionary of the Kingdom of Poland, vol. 6, p. 613-614 In the 18th century the main churches of the town were built: the Polish-Armenian Church of the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the Greek St. Nicholas Church.Geographical Dictionary of the Kingdom of Poland, vol. 6, p. 614  Russian period  Interior of the Polish Church of the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary prior to 1937 demolition The town was annexed by Russia after the 1793 Second Partition of Poland. After the restoration of Polish independence, Mohyliv was briefly captured by the Poles under the command of General Franciszek Krajowski in 1919, but it ultimately fell to the Soviet Union. In 1937, during the Polish Operation of the NKVD, the Soviets destroyed the Polish Church of the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary.  Romanian period  Mohyliv-Podilskyi was occupied by Romanian and German troops in July 1941 and incorporated into the Romanian-ruled Transnistria Governorate. Soon thereafter, thousands of Jews in the town were murdered by the occupiers. Mohyliv-Podilskyi soon became a transit camp for Jews expelled from Bessarabia and Bukovina to Transnistria. From September 1941 to February 1942 more than 55,000 deportees came through the town. Thousands of people were jammed into the transit camp and treated cruelly by the Romanian guards. Many Jews were not allowed to stay in Mohyliv-Podilskyi; thousands were forced to travel by foot to nearby villages and towns. The 15,000 who were initially permitted to stay in the town organized themselves into groups. Some 2,000‚Äî3,000 were given residence permits, while the rest lived in constant fear of being deported into the Transnistrian interior for forced labor. In December 1943 over 3,000 Jews were allowed to return to Romania, and in March 1944, Jewish leaders in Bucharest got permission to bring back 1,400 orphans. Mohyliv-Podilskyi was liberated that month; many Jewish men were immediately drafted by the Soviet army. Many who stayed in the city were killed by German bombs. Most of the deportees were allowed to return to Romania in the spring of 1945.  Ukrainian period  Mohyliv-Podilskyi has been part of Ukraine since August 24, 1991.

He lost his place to his former Mosborough teammate Freddie Green after playing the next game, a 1‚Äì0 defeat away to Aldershot, but after missing just one game re-emerged as a left-back, replacing Ernie Stokes. He finished his first season as a professional having made 11 league appearances and began the following season as the regular left- back. However, after playing the first 13 league games, he lost his place and was to only make a further 3 first-team appearances that season. His career was interrupted by the war, but when league football resumed he was still with Torquay and was the regular right-back in Torquay's 1946-47 side. He left Torquay in 1948, having made 77 league appearances, and joined non-league Yeovil Town. In 1949 he was part of the famous Yeovil side that reached the 5th Round of the FA Cup, beating then giants Sunderland, including England star Len Shackleton who Keeton kept quiet throughout the game, in the 4th Round.

It was directed by Clare Peploe, produced by her husband Bernardo Bertolucci, and stars Mira Sorvino and Ben Kingsley. In an unidentified country in 18th century Europe, a usurper's daughter (Mira Sorvino) has inherited the throne and feels guilty about her family's crimes. She learns that the Queen gave birth to a prince and the rightful heir, Agis (Jay Rodan), who was secretly sent to live with the great philosopher Hermocrates. Agis has been taught to hate her and the entire female sex, and to reject all love. After gaining information from one of Hermocrates' servants, she goes to see Agis for herself and finds him bathing in a lake in the forest. She falls in love with him at first sight, but he is kept in seclusion by Hermocrates (Ben Kingsley) and his sister Leontine (Fiona Shaw) to protect him from her. She wishes to gain Agis' love in return and marry him so that they may share the throne, but to get close enough to Agis, she must embark on a series of bribes, deceptions, and seductions. Characters ;The Princess : The daughter of a usurper who falls in love with Agis, the rightful heir to the throne. Agis has been taught to hate her above all else, so she disguises herself as a young male scholar named Phocion and attempts to deceive both Hermocrates and his sister Leontine, all the while trying to get closer to Agis and make him fall in love with her. ;Hermocrates : A great philosopher who hates the usurper princess and has been teaching Agis to despise her, the entire female sex and scorn the notion of 'love'. Discovering that 'Phocion' is really a woman, the princess (now calling herself 'Aspasie') tells him that she has fallen in love with him, and seduces him so that he will allow her to stay at his house (and therefore give her more time with Agis). ;Leontine : Hermocrates' sister who is attempting several experiments to create electricity. Throughout most of the movie she believes that the princess is a man named Phocion. She is the first person that Phocion/the princess seduces, and is devastated upon discovering that she has been tricked. Occasionally, Leontine imagines that she can see an audience watching her, a reference to the fact that the movie is based on a play. ;Agis : A handsome young man who is the rightful heir to the throne. He has been taught to hate women (the princess especially) and to reject all love. He becomes friends with Phocion, and is delighted to finally have someone to talk too. 'Phocion' soon reveals herself as a woman (but not as the princess) and Agis already treasures their friendship too much to hate her now based on her sex. He becomes more and more confused about his feelings and soon realises that he's falling in love with her. ;Corine : The princess's lady-in-waiting who assists the princess any way she can. She also disguises herself as a man named Hermidas, and infiltrates Hermocrates' home along with the princess. Corine is invaluable to the princess, as both a loyal friend and as an accomplice. It is implied that Corine and Harlequin are slightly attracted to each other. ;Harlequin : One of Hermocrates' servants who catches the princess and Corine climbing over the wall and overhears them talking about their plan. The princess bribes him into aiding them and keeping their identities secret. It is implied that he likes Corine, for when 'Phocion's good looks are complimented, he adds that 'they are both attractive', and is later seen playfully giving Corine a foot rub. ;Dimas : Hermocrates' gardener. Harlequin reveals the women's identities to him so that they will both be paid (to which Corine reacts angrily). Hermocrates had asked Dimas to spy on Phocion/Aspasie to discover her true intentions. Now also bribed by the princess, Dimas gives Hermocrates false information, leading Hermocrates to believe that Aspasie really does love him.

It was notified in its current form under the Wildlife and Countryside Act in 1988. The site includes the Somerset Wildlife Trust's Mounsey Wood Nature Reserve and the Knaplock and North Barton SSSI which has been notified since 1954. Marsh fritillary Plantlife  The Barle Valley, which consists of steep sandstone slopes with acidic soils, contains large areas of ancient upland of Sessile Oak woodland. This woodland is present between and on the valley-side. Over Eighty-five different types of vascular plant species have been recorded in the area, including thirty-one ancient woodland indicators. As well, it features areas of the valley mire, heathland and acidic grassland. These meadows are biodiverse with one of the few sites of the great burnet (Sanguisorba officinalis) in Exmoor. The mires are fed by springs which flow from the base of the sandstone slopes and are dominated by moss carpets due to their low-nutrient environment. In the woodland areas, there is an abundance of lichens, with one hundred and sixty-five populations of epiphytic lichens are present, many of which are from rare species. Due to a large amount of ancient woodland indicators in Barle it gives it a very high index of ecological continuity. Birds Wood warbler The site contains a wide variety of woodland breeding birds including particularly high densities of redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus), wood warbler (Phylloscopus sibilatrix) and pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca). These are all summer visitors. The River Barle provides an important habitat for kingfisher (Alcedo atthis), dipper (Cinclus cinclus) and grey wagtail (Motacilla cinerea), while scrub and heath have breeding stonechat (Saxicola torquata) and whinchat (Saxicola rubetra). Other species In the valley over twenty different species of butterfly have been recorded including the nationally scarce marsh fritillary (Eurodryas aurinia) and vulnerable high brown fritillary (Argynnis adippe). Both roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and red deer (Cervus elaphus) graze in the pastures. Also, otters (Lutra lutra) have been recorded on Barle. A colony of dormice (Muscardinus avellanarius) inhabits at least one of the hazel coppices.

His contribution to stratigraphic classification of rocks and procedures is a monumental work which received universal acceptance. The firm he worked for, the Gulf Oil Corporation in Venezuela, trusted his findings and explored what had until then been uncharted territory. As a result, they reaped huge benefits from their petroleum findings. Hedberg taught at Princeton University from 1959 until his retirement in 1971. He was awarded the Mary Clark Thompson Medal by the National Academy of Sciences in 1973. In 1975 he was awarded the Wollaston Medal by the Geological Society of London. Hedberg won the Sidney Powers Memorial Award in 1963. Early life Hollis Dow Hedberg was born on 29 May 1903 in Falun, Kansas. He belonged to a small Swedish community and his parents lived on the second floor of the house. At that time Kansas experienced the worst flood in its history. His father, Carl August Hedberg, born in Sweden came to the US as one of four children. His mother, Zada Mary Dow, was of Scottish-English descent. His initial years were difficult; he worked in the fields. He developed a skill for whistling (which became his trait) while ploughing fields with horses. He came from a musical family: his father played violin, his mother the piano, his brother James the viola, and he played cello. They were fond of reading books to one another. Education Hedberg joined the Falun elementary school in 1909 and attended Falun Rural High School from 1916 to 1920. After graduating from high school, in 1920 he was admitted to the University of Kansas in Lawrence. Initially he was interested in journalism but later decided to study geology. His college study was interrupted when his father died in 1921 forcing him to return home to run the farm. He resumed his studies in 1922 and in 1925 completed his BA degree in geology with a distinction as a Phi Beta Kappa key. He joined Cornell University in Ithaca, New York in 1925 and in 1926 was awarded an MS in geology. In 1924 and 1925, he enjoyed a summer internship as a field assistant for the Kansas State Geological Survey. In 1926, he contributed a technical paper on \\"The Effect of Gravitational Compaction on the Structure of Sedimentary Rocks\\" based on his investigations at the University of Kansas. He put forward a theory that porosity in shales was an index of pressure metamorphism liable to indicate the presence of oil, years before the approach was documented in the literature. He was awarded a Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1937. Career His first employment in 1926 was as a petrographer with the Maracaibo laboratory. He worked in this capacity for Lago Petroleum Corporation, a Venezuelan subsidiary of Standard Oil. In June 1926, he travelled to Maracaibo, his first business trip outside the United States. He wrote letters to his mother every other day as he was very close to his family. Fond of travel, he went on tours almost every week. When in the Misoa River area, on the eastern part of Lake Maracaibo, he almost lost his life in a flash flood in the Ryan River during an intense rainstorm. Based on his field investigations during this period he propounded the theory that correlation and dating of rocks could be undertaken without the help of fossils which he documented in a paper titled \\"Some Aspects of Sedimentary Petrography in Relation to Stratigraphy in the Bolivar Coast Fields of the Maracaibo Basin, Venezuela\\" (1928)\\". As he was not enthused by the work he was doing, he terminated his contract with Lago Petroleum and returned to New York in March 1928. He then decided to join the geological laboratory of the Venezuelan Gulf Oil Company in Maracaibo as a stratigrapher. But his ship was diverted to Port Arthur and in the confusion he returned to New York on a train and took another ship. On board he met Frances Murray, whom he later married. In 1928, he became head of the geological laboratory. In spite of frequent health problems, he undertook extensive field trips and published papers propounding many new theories on the stratigraphy of geological sections in different regions of Venezuela. A particular find described in a paper titled \\"Cretaceous Limestones as Petroleum Source Rock in Northwestern Venezuela\\" (1931) was of the La Luna Formation of Cenomanian/Turonian Age, concluding that Luna Formation was a major source of the petroleum embedded in tertiary sediments in the Lake Maracaibo area. He also established a network of measured stratigraphic sections of the Rio Querecual in eastern Venezuela. One of Hedberg's endearing qualities in Venezuela was helping local Indians. One of them, Innocensio, a worker who was helping him in his field work in Perija Mountains was eager to learn to read and write, practicing under a tree at night. He appointed him as assistant in the laboratory at Maracaibo where Innocensio eventually turned out to be one of Gulf Oil's best technicians. There was a brief interlude when Frances Murray visited Venezuela. Hedberg dated her, took a holiday in New York and after a brief engagement in September 1932, married her that November. She joined him later in Venezuela in 1933. In 1934, he took a brief break from his work to complete his doctorate from Stanford University, Palo Alto after undertaking geological research in 1934-35 and publishing his first paper on stratigraphic nomenclature, a forerunner of his monumental work in the field. He was awarded his doctorate in June 1937, in absentia. In his professional career, he was promoted in December 1939 as Assistant Chief Geologist and posted to Gulf's San Tom√© camp in eastern Venezuela. In August 1946, he became Chief Geologist of the Gulf Oil's foreign exploration unit for foreign projects (excluding Venezuela), working from New York. He became Chief Geologist for worldwide operations in September 1952 and moved to Oakmont in Pittsburg. In 1957 he was appointed the Vice President of all Gulf Oil explorations, a position he retained until 1964. He then became exploration advisor to the executive until 1968. He retired from Gulf Oil Corporation in 1968. Hedberg made significant contributions in the field of geology of the oceans. Hedberg chaired the Project Mohole committee from 1962-1963. Project Mohole was an ambitious attempt to drill through the Earth's crust into the Mohoroviƒçiƒá discontinuity, and it was one of the first attempts at deep ocean drilling. In 1967, on his suggestion, Gulf Oil Exploration launched \\"R/V Gulfrex\\", an exploration ship which operated across the globe until 1975 covering some 160,000 miles. The R/V Gulfrex was replaced in 1974 by the \\"R/V Hollis Hedberg\\", named after Hedberg. The R/V Hedberg covered 200,000 miles before being decommissioned in 1985. His approach was that the \\"other side of the basin\\", the Deep Shore should be explored for petroleum. This led to his commitment to defend the offshore limits and urged the United States to protect its offshore petroleum resources. He proposed a \\"multi-company/government academic institutions consortium to evaluate the offshore potential\\". During the Reagan administration, he prepared a well-researched paper \\"National-International Jurisdictional Boundary on the Ocean Floor\\". In the third United Nations Law of the Sea Conference, he opposed the move to limit the jurisdiction of a country to an arbitrary 200 nautical miles limit as it would cause 250,000 square mile jurisdictional loss of territory to the US for deep water exploration. Though the UN Law of the Sea Convention was adopted, President Ronald Reagan refused to sign it and he walked out of the Third Convention. Credit for this is attributed to Hedberg. Between 1959 and 1972, Hedberg worked as a professor in the Princeton University and lectured graduate students on \\"Stratigraphic Systems\\". Honors Hedberg received many honors and awards, becoming the first foreign recipient of the Medalla de Honor de la Instruccion Publica, which was awarded by the Venezuelan Government in 1941. Upon his retirement from Princeton, he was honored in 1972 by a conference on petroleum and global tectonics. His awards list is long and impressive and includes Sidney Powers Medal and the University of Kansas Distinguished Service Award in 1963 and the Geological Society of America's Penrose Medal in 1980. The Penrose Medal is the most prestigious award for a geologist in the United States. Personal life Hedberg married Frances Murray and they had five children: they had four sons: Ronald, James, William, and Franklin Augustin, and one daughter: Mary. He and Frances Murray had a happy married life of 56 years. His wife who helped him in his work contributed to a well knit family. Three of his children also hold Phd degrees. Hedberg was a keen athlete and continued his interest of gardening in his vegetable garden in his holiday home in Cape Cod. Occasionally he played the accordion and also took part in square dancing with his wife. He died on 14 August 1988. ISEM had proudly housed the Hollis D. Hedberg Library.

Critical reception In recent years many empty spaces have appeared in the Unirea shopping center in Bucharest where once mainstreet and many less well known brands had their outlets. The state of the building has deteriorated gravely, which may lead to more vacancies in the near future. For occasional Romanian clients and foreign tourists it seems already to be clear that when the owner of the building does not invest in redevelopment (e.g., by reduction of shop floor capacity and modernisation, combined with creation of office space at the top floors of the building), this unique Bucharest landmark mall, despite its magnificent location and history, may loose its attraction completely, and could remain only an interesting outer hull for advertisement purposes mainly.

A general, C√≥rdova was longtime dictator Manuel Isidoro Belzu's son-in-law. As such, he was the main support to his despotic regime. When in 1855 Belzu decided to call elections and \\"retire\\" from politics in the face of repeated rebellions against his rule, he sponsored C√≥rdova's candidacy. The latter was elected president and proceeded to be sworn in on August 15, 1855, at age thirty-three. Not surprisingly, C√≥rdova was widely seen as ex-president Belzu's proxy, and merely an instrument of his power. Belzu remained the proverbial \\"power behind the throne,\\" and this fact only spurred the opposition to continue to conspire against the hated Belzu-C√≥rdova regime, which had run Bolivian politics since 1847. Eventually, the forces arrayed against the president coalesced around the forceful civilian Constitutionalist Jos√© Mar√≠a Linares, who in October 1857 at long last succeeded in toppling C√≥rdova from power. Fleeing the country, he eventually returned to Bolivia, eager as always to support his father-in-law's ambitions to return to the Bolivian Government Palace.

He toppled the Nasiri Dynasty of the Nawabs and took powers of the Nawab. He is also one of the few Mughal-era leaders known for his victory during the Battle of Burdwan against the Maratha Empire during the Maratha invasions of Bengal. Early life Alivardi Khan's father was Shah Quli Khan (Mirza Muhammad Madani) and his mother was the daughter of Nawab Aqil Khan Afshar (Mir Muhammad Askari). Alivardi's birth name was Mirza Muhammad Ali. His father was employee of Azam Shah, the son of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. Azam Shah also employed the sons of Mirza Muhammad. But after the death of Azam Shah, the family fell into poverty. His two sons Muhammad Ali and Mirza Ahmed managed to find employment under the Subahdar (Provincial governor) of Orissa, Shuja-ud-Din Muhammad Khan. After Shuja-ud-Din was promoted to the post of the Nawab of Bengal, the two brothers' future prospects widened. Rise to power Alivardi Khan with a courtier In 1728, Shuja-ud-Din promoted Muhammad Ali to Faujdar (General) of Rajmahal and entitled him as Alivardi Khan. In 1733, he was assigned as the Naib Nazim (Deputy Subahdar) of Bihar. A year later he was titled Shuja ul-Mulk (Hero of the country), Hassemm ud-Daula (Sword of the state) and Mahabat Jang (Horror in War) and the rank of Paach Hazari Mansabdar (The rank holder of 5000) by Nawab Shuja ud-Din and returned to Azimabad. Alivardi Khan aspired for larger authority. On 10 April 1740 in the Battle of Giria, he defeated and killed Shuja ud-Din's successor, Sarfaraz Khan. Thus he took control of Bengal and Bihar. Then on 3 March 1741 he defeated Rustam Jang, deputy governor of Orissa and a relative of Sarfaraz Khan, in the battle of Phulwarion. Orissa also came under control of Alivardi Khan. Reign Tomb of Khan at Khushbagh Alivardi Khan is known to have introduced and placed his artillery on large movable platforms, which were driven by oxen. Immediately after his usurpation of power, Alivardi Khan had his takeover legitimized by the Mughal Emperor [Muhammad Shah] and resumed the policies of Murshid Quli Khan. Although he was the Nawab of Bengal he also used titles such as Nizam, he also chose Faujdars from various regions such as Patna, Dacca and Orissa. Since 1742, the Maratha Empire raided Bengal repeatedly ravaging its territories, and Alivardi Khan had almost immediately a long ditch, called the Maratha ditch, dug around Calcutta. Alivardi Khan was a brilliant artillery tactician, however, his armies were overrun by the large force of the Marathas from Berar who had arrived to pillage and plunder the territories of Bengal, under the commands of Raghoji I Bhonsle. In the year 1747, the Marathas led by Raghoji, began to raid, pillage and annex the territories of the Alivardi Khan. During the Maratha invasion of Orissa, its Subedar Mir Jafar completely withdrew all forces until the arrival of Alivardi Khan and the Mughal Army at the Battle of Burdwan where Raghoji and his Maratha forces were completely routed. The enraged Alivardi Khan then dismissed the shamed Mir Jafar. Alivardi Khan's defending armies were overrun in Orissa in the year 1751, despite receiving some assistance from Shuja-ud- Daula. But Orissa was ultimately surrendered to the ravaging Marathas by the Mughal Emperor Ahmad Shah Bahadur. These Maratha raids would continue until 1751, when a peace-treaty was settled between Ahmad Shah Bahadur, Alivardi Khan and Raghoji. Alivardi Khan also subdued the revolt of a few unruly Afghans who were trying to separate Bihar from his administration. According to some historians Alivardi Khan reign of 16 years, was mostly engaged in various wars against the Marathas. Towards the end, he turned his attention to rebuilding and restoring Bengal.  Battle of Burdwan  The Battle of Burdwan was a major confrontation between the Mughal Empire's Nawab of Bengal, Alivardi Khan and his invading Maratha opponents Janoji Bhonsle and Bhaskar Pandit. The battle concluded with a victory for the Nawab of Bengal, Alivardi Khan who was accompanied throughout the campaign by his wife Nafisah Khanam. In the year 1747, the Marathas led by Janoji Bhonsle, began to raid, pillage and annex the territories of the Nawab of Bengal, Alivardi Khan in Orissa.

A Mahout and its rider in service of the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah. During the Maratha invasion of Orissa, its Subedar Mir Jafar and other officials such as Ataullah Faujdar of Rajmahal completely withdrew all forces and without any resistance awaited the arrival of Alivardi Khan and the Mughal Army. When the Nawab of Bengal, Alivardi Khan received letters warning of the approach of Maratha he was completely disillusioned by this unforeseen invasion, in fact some of his trusted advisors even began to blame their aligned companion Asaf Jah I, the Nizam of Hyderabad for utter negligence in the Deccan. In order to counter the eminent threat Alivardi Khan rallied a Mughal Army of nearly 10,000 troops also consisting of conscripts such as Abyssinian Sailors and Georgian Qizilbash. Alivardi Khan then informed the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah of the invasion and rode ceaselessly for almost three days towards the ruins of Bardhaman where the Marathas established occupation. Alivardi Khan is known to have introduced and placed his artillery on large movable platforms driven that were by Oxen. After reaching the ruins of Bardhaman, Alivardi Khan's vanguard under the command of Musahib Khan Mohmand was completely overrun. The Howdah of Nafisah Khanam (the wife of Alivardi Khan) had been captured and the elephant named Landah was dragged towards the Maratha encampment. Unwilling to abandon his command over the vanguard Musahib Khan Mohmand son of Umar Khan Mohmand one of Alivardi Khans commanders, led what remained of the vanguard's Sowars, Mahauts and Sepoy in order to attack the pillagers. Although the Howdah of Nafisah Khanam had been liberated, Musahib Khan Mohmand and his troops however fell in battle, their courage was compared to that of Rostam by Alivardi Khan. According to Ghulam Husain Tabatabai when Alivardi Khan was reunited with his wife Nafisah Khanam, his forces were completely surrounded by Marathas, who had entrenched themselves a various positions whilst Alivardi Khan's forces faced starvation. After carefully planning the battle ahead, Alivardi Khan brilliantly organized his forces by placing baggage trains in the center and artillery carriages around his army. Mustafa Khan Bahadur prepared his Sowars for assault. Saulat Jang had finally arrived from Murshidabad with reinforcements and provisions. Alivaedi Khan then sent a baggage train containing fine carpets, silks and ewers into his opponents lines provoking the Maratha to gather and loot the baggage trains. This action had exposed the Marathas to Alivardi Khan's advancing artillery carriages. While Mustafa Khan Bahadur prepared his Sowars on the left and right flanks and completely routed Janoji Bhonsle and his remaining Maratha infantry. very soon Haji Ahmad arrived with even more provisions and fodder for Alivardi Khan's forces.

The novel is the second in the four-volume The History of the Runestaff. The events in this novel take place immediately after the preceding volume, The Jewel in the Skull. Plot summary Book One Heading West back to the Kamarg and Yisselda, Dorian Hawkmoon and Oladahn find themselves in the deserted city of Soryandum. Oladahn disappears while out hunting and on seeking him Hawkmoon sees an ornithopter of the Dark Empire of Granbretan. Oladahn is captured by forces of the Dark Empire, led by renegade Frenchman Huillam d'Averc, but inexplicably survives what should be a fatal fall when he escapes by throwing himself from the top of a tower. Hawkmoon and Oladahn battle the Dark Empire warriors but are ultimately overcome by weight of numbers. Hawkmoon and Oladahn are imprisoned awaiting an ornithopter to transport them to Sicilia. Oladahn reveals that he was rescued from his fall by ghosts, and these wraiths re- appear and free the pair. The wraiths are the inhabitants of Soryandum, transformed by their own science so that they exist in another dimension. D'Averc is planning to raze Soryandum which would destroy the wraiths, so they call on Hawkmoon to aid them by recovering a pair of old Soryandum machines. When they transcended this dimension the wraiths had the machines hidden and guarded by a mechanical beast which Hawkmoon will have to defeat. Hawkmoon and Oladahn find the machine store and defeat the mechanical beast by blinding it. They recover the two machines but the mechanical beast follows after them. Hawkmoon and Oladahn return the machines to the wraiths, who use one to shift the entire city of Soryandum to another dimension, giving the other machine to Hawkmoon for his own use. Meanwhile, the forces of the Dark Empire are attacked by the machine beast and Hawkmoon and Oladahn make their escape. The pair continue their journey, next stopping at the town of Birachek. Later Hawkmoon and Oladahn secure passage from Captain Mouso on The Smiling Girl, a vessel heading for Crimea. During the journey they pick up the shipwrecked D'Averc and Hawkmoon intends to keep him as a hostage. The Smiling Girl then finds herself under attack from a pirate ship belonging to the Muskovian Cult of the Mad God. During the attack Hawkmoon, Oladahn and D'Averc manage to capture the ship belonging to the Cult of the Mad God. Amongst the looted treasure in the hold Hawkmoon finds the engagement ring he gave to Yisselda and fears for her safety. The trio manage to take one of the cultists captive, and learn that they are innocent sailors who are drugged to commit acts of violent piracy. Hawkmoon, Oladahn and D'Averc lay in wait to capture the cultist's man Captain Shagarov, and he informs them that any captured females would have been taken to the Mad God himself. Shagarov is killed and the pirate ship set alight, while the trio escape on a skiff and head towards Ukrania and the Mad God. Book Two Hawkmoon, Oladahn, and D'Averc reach the shore and find the Warrior in Jet and Gold awaiting them. Once again the Warrior informs Hawkmoon that he is a servant of the Runestaff, and that as well as saving the kidnapped Yisselda he must also recover a Red Amulet ‚Äì an artefact linked to the Runestaff which bestows power on its servants but madness to others. Hawkmoon, Oladahn, D'Averc, and the Warrior in Jet and Gold head deeper into Ukrania, along the way crossing the mysterious Throbbing Bridge and encountering signs of the Dark Empire's forces. They reach the Mad God's Castle and defeat a group of warrior women, but elsewhere the castle is already filled with corpses. Hawkmoon enters the castle and confronts the Mad God, Stalnikov, who sets a hypnotised Yisselda to attacking him. On the point of defeat Stalnikov releases Yisselda from his sway, but Hawkmoon attacks and kills him anyway. Yisselda informs Hawkmoon that Von Villach has been killed by Dark Empire forces and Count Brass is gravely ill. The Mad God's castle is stormed by Granbretan troops and when they brand D'Averc a traitor he elects to join forces with Hawkmoon. The Warrior in Jet and Gold persuades Hawkmoon to wear the Red Amulet, saying it is his only chance to escape the castle. Aided by the power of the Red Amulet Hawkmoon fights his way out of the Mad God's hall. In the castle courtyard the group are attacked by more Dark Empire warriors, but Hawkmoon uses the Red Amulet to command the Mad God's remaining warrior women to attack them. Hawkmoon uses the power of the Red Amulet to command the Mad God's mutant war-jaguars and escapes the castle along with Yisselda, Oladahn, and D'Averc. Along the way however they become separated from the Warrior in Jet and Gold who was attempting to recover the mechanical device Hawkmoon had been given by the wraiths of Soryandum. The group travel on to the mountains of Carpathia, where they are attacked by Dark Empire forces and are forced to set their war-jaguars free in the battle. Arriving in the town of Zorvanemi they go undercover as a party of holy men, but after killing a number of Dark Empire troops in a tavern fight they decide to don their armour and masquerade as warriors of Granbretan under D'Averc's leadership. The group ride further into Shekia, and join a camp of Dark Empire forces massed outside the city of Bradichla. D'Averc leaves the group and betrays them leading to their capture. Hawkmoon, Yisselda, and Oladahn are brought before Baron Meliadus, who survived the battle of Hamadan. He orders the three bound in chains and vows to take them back to Granbretan, stopping first on the way to witness the fall of the Kamarg. Arriving at the Kamarg Baron Meliadus orders his forces to begin the final assault. Overnight D'Averc reveals his true loyalties by drugging the guards and releasing Hawkmoon, Yisselda, and Oladahn. The group ride through the Dark Empire forces to the Kamarg though D'Averc is wounded in the process. Arriving at Castle Brass the sight of the returned Yisselda and Hawkmoon is enough to cure Count Brass of the sickness of spirit that has plagued him, and together with Hawkmoon he rushes to lead his forces in the defence of the Kamarg. On leaving Castle Brass however they witness the destruction of the last of their war towers with Kamarg seemingly about to fall. Aided by the power of the Red Amulet Hawkmoon helps drive the Dark Empire forces back to the borders of the Kamarg. The Kamarg forces regroup at Castle Brass and the Dark Empire forces begin a siege. The Warrior in Jet and Gold reappears at Castle Brass and delivers to Hawkmoon the dimension warping device of the people of Soryandum. The Dark Empire forces begin their final assault on Castle Brass but the Warrior in Jet and Gold activates the Soryandum machine and shifts the castle into another dimension. The people of the Kamarg are safe for now, but Baron Meliadus vows to learn of a way to follow them, and Hawkmoon knows that he must return to do battle again.

Meanwhile, Harris, Cook and Allen started over again with a new set of parks which they then expanded in October 2000 by buying The Rank Group‚Äôs holiday business. This purchase included the Haven caravan sites, three Butlins holiday camps, Oasis Holiday Village and Warner Leisure Hotels. The deal cost ¬£700m and was part financed by Legal & General Ventures and Candover.The Times, October 14, 2000 The business was able to buy out these two private equity firms a few years later. Following this major expansion of the company some sites were subsequently sold as part of a rationalisation of the business. In March 2001 seven parks were sold to Premier Dawn for ¬£15m, and soon afterwards Cinque Ports bought nine parks for ¬£28.7m. In May 2001 twelve Haven sites were sold to Park Resorts Ltd, in a management buy-out in partnership with CBPE for ¬£48m. In September 2001, Center Parcs acquired the Oasis Holiday Village, at Whinfell Forest, Cumbria. In February 2004 LGV and Candover sold their 28% stake back to management in a deal that valued the firm at more than ¬£1 billion. And in October 2004 Bourne sold a package of five sites to Parkdean Holidays for ¬£42m.The Sunday Telegraph, December 12, 2004 In November 2004 the company sold its European operation Haven Europe for ¬£250m (now named Siblu Europe.

The Paredarerme name for the island is Tiggana marraboona. The locality of Schouten Island is in the local government area of Glamorgan‚ÄìSpring Bay in the South-east region of Tasmania. History Schouten Island lies within the territory of the Oyster Bay tribe of Tasmanian Aborigines and kitchen middens indicates Indigenous tribes inhabited the island prior to European settlement. In 1642, while surveying the south-west coast of Tasmania, Abel Tasman named the island after Joost Schouten, a member of the Council of the Dutch East India Company. Members of the Baudin expedition landed on Schouten in 1802. In the early 19th century, sealers were active in the area and are known to have visited the island.Parry Kostoglou, Sealing in Tasmania Historical Research Project, Parks and Wildlife Service, Hobart, 1996, p.74-5. Shore-based whaling stations operated on the island in the 1830s and 1840s at five different locations. The discovery of coal on the island in 1809 by a sealer, John Stacey led to between 1842 and 1925, several phases of coal and tin mining, where in 1880 a small number of Chinese men worked the ground for tin. Stacey found that of land could be suitable for cultivation. Plans to use convict labour to mine coal on the island in the 1840s were never realised. From 1850 Schouten was used for grazing sheep, with grazing leases only expiring in 1969. Topography and geology Schouten Island as viewed from the top of Mount Freycinet Schouten is a rugged island with the highest point, Mount Storey, above sea level. It is surrounded by cliffs, broken by sheltered bays. A north-south fault line divides the island where the eastern part of the island is composed of granite while the western part is dolerite overlying sedimentary and supergroup rocks. Flora and fauna The natural vegetation of the island is dominated by eucalypt forest on the dolerite soils in the west, and by scrubland, heathland and sedgeland communities on the granitic soils of the east. Areas associated with previous human disturbance, such as clearing, grazing and frequent burning, are dominated by grasses and herbs. Little penguins and short-tailed shearwaters breed on the island, along with other bird species such as the Tasmanian nativehen. Australian fur seals haul out on the eastern side. Reptiles present include the Tasmanian tree skink, she-oak skink, southern grass skink and three-lined skink.

Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences (UND Aerospace) is a multidisciplinary college within the University of North Dakota (UND) in Grand Forks, North Dakota. The school was formed in 1968. The majority of the school's fleet of over 120 aircraft is based at nearby Grand Forks International Airport and is the largest fleet of civilian flight training aircraft in North America. UND Aerospace also operates flight training centers in Crookston, Minnesota, and Phoenix, Arizona. Today, the school has many aerospace-related programs including commercial aviation (fixed wing and rotorcraft), Unmanned aircraft systems operations, air traffic control, airport management, Space Studies, Computer Science, Atmospheric Sciences, and Earth System Science & Policy. Currently, the school has over 500 faculty and 1,900 students making it the second largest of UND's degree-granting colleges. The present dean of the school is Dr. Paul Lindseth. History John D. Odegard (1941‚Äì1998) started the program in 1968 with only two donated aircraft and one other faculty member besides himself. Over time, the program was able to purchase more aircraft and grew dramatically in the number of students enrolled. In 1982, the Center for Aerospace Sciences was established as a result of the growth of UND‚Äôs atmospheric research and aviation education programs. In 1997, as part of a 30th anniversary celebration, the school took on its present name in honor of its founder. The founder of the aviation program at UND, John D. Odegard, logged over 10,000 hours of flight time in his life and was licensed for commercial flight and instrument operations. He was type-rated in Cessna Citations, Learjet, and Beechjet, as well as being a certificated flight instructor (CFI) and certified examiner for commercial, instrument, tailwheel, multiengine, and Citation type-ratings. Having broken the sound barrier in the Concorde (as a passenger) and having flown as a crop- duster to help pay for college, Odegard was no stranger to the varied envelopes of flight. He was quite familiar with the many aspects of aviation and his vision for a well-rounded school which trains pilots in all aspects of flight helped the aviation program at UND become what it is today. Odegard died of cancer in 1998 at the age of 57. He is buried in Grand Forks, less than a mile away from the UND campus. Facilities UND Aerospace maintains facilities including 360 degree air traffic control tower simulators, a remote learning classroom, and a wireless network that is available throughout the entire aerospace complex on the main campus and in any of the buildings at the airport. Funding for additional buildings has already been secured. Main campus All School of Aerospace Sciences facilities on the main UND campus are connected by a series of skyways. Buildings here include Odegard Hall, Clifford Hall, Ryan Hall, and Streibel Hall. As of March 2015 a fifth building, Robin Hall, is presently under construction to accommodate the school's growing research and teaching enterprise in unmanned aerial systems.http://www.aero.und.edu/About/WestCampus.aspx The complex also includes several other buildings including the Center for Entrepreneurship and the Skalicky Tech Incubator. Odegard Hall is the main building in the School of Aerospace Sciences complex on campus and was the first of the four buildings to be built. The building houses classrooms, a portion of faculty offices for the Department of Aviation, the main office of the School of Aerospace Sciences, a full-motion spatial disorientation simulator, an altitude chamber (used to teach flight students about the effects of high altitude on the human body, especially hypoxia), as well as other specialized laboratories. The centerpiece of the main floor is the 200-seat Arthur P. Anderson Atmospherium Planetarium and Lecture Bowl. The second floor hosts many of the School's administrative offices and the Regional Weather Information Center. Connected to Odegard Hall by a large, enclosed breezeway is Streibel Hall which is home of UND's Computer Science department. Clifford Hall houses the Atmospheric Sciences department, the Space Studies Department, the Department of Earth Systems Science & Policy, the UAS Center administrative offices, the Upper Midwest Aerospace Consortium, and the Scientific Computing Center. Dedicated in May 1992, it is the newest addition to the aerospace complex on the Main Campus. A 260-seat auditorium with full audio-visual and recording capability is located on the second floor. The first floor hosts much of UND Aerospace's computing power as well as UND's 360-degree visual Air Traffic Control Tower simulator. Centered on top of Clifford Hall is UND's Polarimetric Doppler Radar used by the Atmospheric Sciences Department. Ryan Hall is home to UND's air traffic control faculty and UND's 16+ flight simulators, including FAA Level 6 flight training devices for the Garmin G-1000 equipped Cessna 172 and Piper Seminole aircraft. Two Canadair Regional Jet flight training devices are used to provide a basic introduction to turbine engine systems as well as to prepare graduate students for the pace of airline training. In addition, there are various simple instrument panel trainers, a basic instrument simulator computer based instruction (CBI) lab, an FAA Knowledge Test Center, and a pair of air traffic control tower simulators. Finally, Ryan Hall is home to the remote classroom and several state of the art digital classrooms. Airport The Grand Forks International Airport campus consists of the dispatch office where students request aircraft and are assigned to practice areas.http://flightops.aero.und.edu/Facilities/facilities.aspx The dispatch office opens out onto Bravo Ramp where the Seminoles, Arrows, and Decathlons are based. It also connects directly to the display hangar where aircraft not in use are sometimes kept. There are 11 heated hangars lining Bravo and Charlie Ramp all owned by UND. These hangars are capable of housing up to 130 aircraft. South of Charlie Ramp is UND's newest hangar, which houses dispatch, flight planning, and general hangar space for the helicopter department. North of Charlie ramp is UND's Flight Operations Administrative building which contains offices for the Standards and Publications Departments, Administrative offices and a cafeteria. Aircraft UND currently operates a fleet of 123 aircraft including 100 airplanes, 7 helicopters, and 9 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV's). The majority of these aircraft are based at Grand Forks International Airport with the remainder located at the two satellite campuses in the United States.Information about UND's fleet of aircraft - und.edu The fleet is primarily made up of 62 Cessna 172 Skyhawks equipped with the Garmin G1000 glass cockpit avionics suite. Currently the Skyhawks are used to teach students in obtaining certification as a private pilot and additional training for the instrument rating as well as the more advanced Certified Flight Instructor (CFI) and Certified Flight Instructor - Instrument (CFII) courses. UND Aerospace took delivery of its first Skyhawk, tail number N511ND, in 2008 as a replacement of the earlier Piper PA-28 Warrior III fleet. UND Aerospace always tries to provide new, technologically advanced aircraft to its students. UND modified its fleet to include the Cessna 172 aircraft after Piper discontinued producing new Piper Warrior III's. In addition to the Skyhawks, UND owns 6 Piper PA-28R Arrows with retractable gear and constant- speed propellers which allows CFI candidates to obtain their complex endorsement and fly on conventional \\"steam gauge\\" instruments. Students utilize 23 Piper PA-44 Seminoles in order to obtain their commercial pilot certificates with a multi-engine rating. Rounding out the fleet, UND Aerospace's Flying Team practices in 3 Cessna 150's. These aircraft were the original aircraft used for pilot training by Odegard. Aerobatic and spin training is provided in 2 American Champion Super Decathlons. Contract students from Air China fly both of the University's King Air aircraft, the BE-90B. Lastly, the Atmospheric Sciences Department employs a Cessna Citation II for weather and atmospheric research. An S-300 helicopter equipped with a Garmin G500H glass display proceeds on a test flight on its way to supplemental type certification from the FAA. Students seeking helicopter training train in one of 6 Sikorsky 300C two-seat helicopters. In 2013 UND Aerospace developed a Supplemental Type Certificate which allowed the installation of Garmin Avionics G500H suite. UND Aerospace is the current holder for the STC. Having updated avionics allows student to train from Private pilot, Instrument, Commercial, CFI and CFII in the same airframe. In January 2017 UND Aerospace took delivery of a Robinson R44 Cadet. Equipped with Garmin G500H, GTN 750, and GTX345 it is ideally set up for SFAR transition training as well as Instrument and Instrument Instructor training. As of September 2011, the Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) department employs nine aircraft for various missions including three CropCam, two Ravan, two Scan Eagle, one Draganflyer, and one Telemaster UAV's. Along with the aircraft, the university provides realistic ground training in UAV flying with its two Reaper, one Predator, and one Scan Eagle flight training devices (FTD). Past aircraft have included models from various manufactures. Prior to the arrival of the Cessna 172 Skyhawks, UND's primary fleet consisted of a combination of glass and conventional-gauge Piper Warrior III's which were the primary workhorses of the UND fleet from 1989 to 2010. The last conventional- gauge Warrior was retired in March 2010. On March 28, 2008, UND Aerospace took delivery of a new Cessna Citation Mustang business jet. However, the school sold it in order to purchase a second King AirAerospace selling jet The school also was given a Piper PA-12 Supercruiser that was overhauled to provide students another aircraft to practice tailwheel landings. In April 2014, UND announced that it would begin phasing out their fleet of Cessna 172 Skyhawks in favor of the Piper Archer, marking a move back to the Piper Cherokee platform for UND's primary flight training.http://www.piper.com/piper-takes- trainer-orders-university-north-dakota-aerospace/ UND's first Piper Archer, N718ND, was delivered in November 2016 featuring the new G1000 NXi avionics suite.http://www.piper.com/piper-leads-way-innovation-garmin-nxi-certified- piston-trainer-aircraft/ The first UND Piper Archer produced.

The company designator and flight/trip number are used instead of the aircraft registration number for ATC security and operational purposes and may be used for the international telecommunications service when its use is advantageous. The telephony designator (used instead of phonetically pronouncing the three letter company designator associated with the aircraft call sign) is usually assigned at the same time as the ICAO three letter designator. The call sign, together with a flight/trip number, is the aircraft identification for radio voice communications with air traffic personnel. The call sign for UND aircraft is \\"Sioux\\". Flying Team The University of North Dakota School of Aerospace Sciences is a member school of the National Intercollegiate Flying Association (NIFA). NIFA is a professional organization that provides a forum of competition and learning for aviation students from colleges all around the United States. In the fall of each year, UND Flying Team students participate in the Region V Safety and Flight Evaluation Conference (SAFECON). The regional SAFECON is hosted each year by one of the five member schools located in the adjacent states of Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin. Within Region V, the UND Flying Team consistently dominates the total School Ranking Overall calculated from the 13 various categories in which competition points are awarded.https://nifa.aero/schools/competition-archives/ Likewise, a national SAFECON takes place in the spring season of the new year. Generally, the top three performing teams in each of the regional SAFECONs from the prior year receive an invitation to attend the national SAFECON. Similar to a regional SAFECON, the national SAFECON is hosted by a member school that has been selected among the schools which have submitted an application to host. The host school also receives an automatic invitation to participate in the national SAFECON, regardless of their performance in the regional SAFECON. Since 1981, when the first complete official competition results of the national SAFECON were recorded, the UND Flying Team has won the NIFA National Championship Trophy a total of 17 times over the course of the last 34 years. Among these 17 championships, the UND Flying Team has recorded a number of multi-year streaks of consecutive championship wins that no other school has been able to match. The first and longest streak was an almost unstoppable seven year championship dynasty from 1985 to 1991. Additionally, since 1985 the UND Flying Team has recorded nine second-place finishes, three third-place finishes, and a fourth-place and sixth-place finish in 1993 and 1992 respectively. Prior to the 1986 national SAFECON, only the top performing national team champions were recorded. The placement of the runner-up teams in those prior years is information which is not available.

The character's first run was from 1973 to 1975, and was based on the popular undead mummy trope of horror fiction. Publication history N'Kantu the Living Mummy first appeared in Supernatural Thrillers #5 (Aug. 1973), created by Steve Gerber and Rich Buckler. It introduced the character in a standalone story set in Cairo, Egypt, \\"The Living Mummy\\". N'Kantu the Living Mummy returned two issues later in \\"The Return of the Living Mummy\\" by the same team, who brought the character to New York City. With the cover logo reading \\"Supernatural Thrillers featuring The Living Mummy\\", the series ran from #7 to the final issue, #15 (June 1974 - Oct. 1975). With issue #8, the creative team became writer Tony Isabella and artist Val Mayerik, occasionally credited as co- plotter.

Fictional character biography Born 3,000 years ago, N'Kantu is the son of T'Chombi, a chief of a Northern African tribe called the Swarili of the nation of Swarilis. At the age of 21, N'Kantu must undergo the Test of the Lion, proving himself to be worthy of being called a warrior. Succeeding in this trial also means that someday N'Kantu would be worthy to succeed his father as king. Months later, his father dies in his sleep, and N'Kantu becomes the chieftain of the Swarili tribe. Returning from a hunt, N'Kantu finds that his village has been ransacked and the entire tribe of Swarili rounded up by Egyptians as slaves. N'Kantu fights to rescue his people, but is overwhelmed and captured by the Egyptian soldiers. N'Kantu and the Swarili are then taken to Egypt, and put to work building monuments to the current Pharaoh, Aram-Set. Recognized as the strongest, and most dangerous of the Swarili, N'Kantu is isolated and forced to work the hardest in an attempt to break his spirit. But at night he and the other Swarili people plot a rebellion, though unbeknownst to them their plotting is being reported to Aram-Set and his chief priest, Nephrus.Nephrus at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe At the completion of the current monument project, the Egyptians take their slaves into its catacombs in preparation for a mass execution. But N'Kantu signals for the revolt and the Swarili slaughter their would-be executioners. N'Kantu slays Aram-Set with his spear and then turns to Nephrus, but the evil priest had prepared, and he sprays N'Kantu in the face with a mysterious paralyzing liquid. N'Kantu is then strapped and bound to a special altar, his body wrapped in papyrus, and his blood is drained and replaced with an unknown alchemical preservative. N'Kantu, who remains conscious through the entire ordeal, is then placed inside a stone sarcophagus.origin recounted in Supernatural Thrillers #5. Marvel Comics. In modern times, the paralyzing fluid finally wears off and N'Kantu escapes from his tomb. Deranged from being paralyzed in a dark tomb for several millennia, he digs himself free and goes on a rampage in Cairo, Egypt.

Powers and abilities As a result of the transfusion of an unknown embalming fluid by the Egyptian high priest Nephrus, N'Kantu has superhuman strength and durability. He is highly resistant to many forms of attack. Although his skin is almost rock-hard in consistency, his wrappings are extremely vulnerable to fire. His blood has been replaced with an alchemical preservative that has allowed him to exist for over three thousand years. He also has no need for food, water, oxygen, or sleep. N'Kantu is able to sense mystical energy and the use of magic. He can also sense and recognize Nephrus' descendants. His body no longer produces saliva, which makes speaking difficult and painful for him. He is nevertheless proficient in ancient Swarili, Egyptian and English. He is extremely sensitive to any dehydrative process which interferes with the preservative fluid in his veins. He has the combat skills of the Swarili warrior class. Some of these abilities are enhanced by his mummified condition, while others are diminished.

Terms Abbott's method -- treatment of scoliosis by lateral pulling and counterpulling on the spinal column by means of wide bandages and pads, until the deformity is over-corrected, and then applying a plaster jacket to produce pressure, counterpressure, and fixation of the spine in its correct position. Abott's Sign -- the obvious lateral curvature of the spine, when physically observed at the back part of a patient suffering from scoliosis.

Other such laboratories include the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), the Laboratory of the Government Chemist (LGC), the Building Research Establishment (BRE) and the Transport Research Establishment (TRL). NEL was established in 1948 at Thorntonhall under the name Mechanical Engineering Research Laboratory (MERL), in the village of the same name near East Kilbride, Glasgow, Scotland. The location was partly dictated by politics, since it was realised that Scotland did not have a UK public research establishment (in contrast to its defence establishments). There was also debate on whether the new laboratory would be an outpost of the prestigious NPL (which now has its main base in Teddington, just west of London), or have a separate identity. Eventually the latter course was taken with the new laboratory focussing on mechanical engineering research, complementing the work of the then CEGB laboratories in electrical engineering when the name was changed to NEL. As NEL expanded, it moved to a large, purpose-built site in East Kilbride itself. Under the control of the Director, it was then part of the DTI. The 'lab' was organised into a number of subject-based divisions, including Creep Division, an important part of the UK effort to catalogue wear characteristics of materials, a Control Systems Division, Manufacturing Services Division, Fluid Power Division and Design Analysis Division. The last of these was in the forefront in the use of the emerging technology of Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Indeed, the growing need for quality-assurance in FEA led to the foundation of the National Agency for Finite Element Methods and Standards, now operating simply as NAFEMS. Each building at NEL was named after a prominent engineer whose field was related to the focus of that division, so there was Maudsley Building, named after Henry Maudslay, famous for his invention of the slide-rest lathe amongst many other achievements, Bramah Building so called after Joseph Bramah owing to his contribution to hydraulic engineering, Rankine Building named after William John Macquorn Rankine which specialised in thermodynamics, Whitworth Building named after Joseph Whitworth immortalised after his work to unify standards for screw threads, one of the key stepping stones that paved the way for mass production. The policy of the Thatcher Government was originally for the full privatisation of all of the government laboratories and the dismantling of NEL was undertaken by Lord Young. In practice, re-organisation has in some cases stopped short of a straight sale of these internationally important facilities, but NEL became part of the German-owned T√úV S√úD group in 1995. Along with the other national laboratories, some of which are still owned or controlled by the UK government, NEL now has a mixed portfolio of work from both government and private sectors. NEL holds the national standard for flow measurement, one of the most important roles it undertakes as part of the overall UK government science strategy. This is now in the remit of the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills, working in part through the new National Measurement Office, which is itself an Executive Agency created in April 2009. Engineering apprenticeships NEL operated an indentured apprentice training scheme and offered a wide range of skills for young engineers before being privatised ranging between light machining, heavy machining, fitting, electro-discharge-machining, jig and horizontal boring and in later years CNC machining, programming and introductions to FMS (flexible manufacturing system) and CAD/CAM facilities running KCurve on DEC/VAX mini computers. This work commenced around 1982-6 using raster scan, (green) monitors to visualise the programming, each known as workstations, (since the 'intelligence' was built into the desk, not the monitor) and the CAD CAM programs were still printed out on punched paper to be transferred in some cases into onboard RAM and in others read and implemented sequentially. Machines in use in the CAD / CAM department were Matchmaker 7000M vertical mill, Norton Variant with Fanuc control, Cincinnati horizontal mill that had (then) been recently retrofitted with Gould drives.

He was one of the few players who ‚Äì at his request ‚Äì was routinely known by his pseudonym, Felix. When his father died in 1824 he had inherited the running of his school, aged only nineteen, and he was afraid that the parents of pupils might think that cricket was too frivolous a pastime for a schoolmaster. Felix was a specialist left-handed batsman, although he did occasionally bowl underarm slow left-arm orthodox. He was a mainstay of the great Kent team of the mid-19th century alongside such players as Alfred Mynn, Fuller Pilch, William Hillyer and Ned Wenman. In the words of the famous elegy, best loved of Bernard Darwin, :And with five such mighty cricketers 'twas but natural to win :As Felix, Wenman, Hillyer, Fuller Pilch and Alfred Mynn. Felix played for Kent from 1830 until 1852. He also appeared for MCC sides and was a member of William Clarke's All- England Eleven. In his overall first-class career, Felix played in 149 matches and scored 4,556 runs with a highest score of 113. He played at a time when prevailing conditions greatly favoured bowlers and was rated very highly as a batsman by his contemporaries. He was the author of a famous instruction book: Felix on the Bat published in 1845. He also invented the catapulta (a bowling machine) as well as India-rubber batting gloves. A man of many talents, he was also a classical scholar, musician, linguist, inventor, writer and artist. Felix died at Wimborne Minster in Dorset and is buried in Wimborne cemetery.

An Apex club is a community service club, neither sectarian nor party political, that provides young civic minded people the opportunity to volunteer within the community and develop personally through club run schemes such as public speaking competitions. Club members are volunteers aged between 18 and 45. Ideals Apex members share the same ideals, to: *make the ideal of service the basis of all enterprise *develop by example a more intelligent and aggressive citizenship *provide means of forming enduring friendships, and rendering altruistic service and building better communities *promote international understanding and friendship. History Sculpture located in Johnstone Park, Geelong marking the formation of the association The first Apex Club was formed at Geelong in December 1930 when three architects attempted to join the Rotary Club of Geelong. As Rotary has a rule restricting one profession to each club the three architects - Ewan Laird, Langham Proud and John Buchan went on to form The Young Businessmen's Club of Geelong. After clubs were formed at Ballarat and Camperdown, The Association of Apex Clubs was formed, and the three clubs shortly thereafter were branded as \\"Apex\\". This creation was done at the height of the Great Depression in Australia. The inaugural club acknowledged the assistance of the local Rotary Club for assistance and advice. Members were originally males from 18 to 35, although those who had joined could remain past 35. By March 1933, Tasmania was proposing two clubs, while New South Wales and Victoria had a total of eight clubs. A Wollongong club became the eighteenth recognised by the association in August 1934. The 1938 national convention was opened by the prime minister Joseph Lyons. The Golden Jubilee National Apex Convention in Geelong, Victoria in 1981 was opened by HRH Prince Charles. Until the early 1990s Apex only allowed male members, but the 2006 National Convention decided to merge the gender specific clubs (and boards) that had formed into one and for all to accept members of both genders to their clubs. The last Apex in the Geelong Region (Grovedale) folded in 2015. Activities There are clubs in every state and territory of Australia and within each state there are regions which clubs belong to. There are approximately 150 active clubs. Membership is open to men and women between 18 and 45, although each individual club now have the right to increase this upper age limit and numerous clubs have done so. School-based Apex Youth Clubs are also being introduced for members between 14 and 18. Apex undertakes a range of activities aimed at youth with its major programs including running Public Speaking and Debating competitions. Apex also runs the Apex Australia Teenage Fashion Awards in each state with the top three in each section heading to the national final, that is held in October each year. Other events include the Gympie Music Muster held outside Gympie each year, as well as ute musters, B&S; balls, and anything else a club decides to organise. Apex has raised large amounts of money to put into trust funds which then distribute grants each year, this is held under the custodianship of the Apex Foundation.

She is quite confused about why Odin took all of the Asgardians back to the Asgard Realm, and is still deciding as to whether she should join them. While saving some people in the city, she is attacked because she has a hammer similar to those which had been appearing all around the earth, and accidentally kills a police officer who shot at her by deflecting the bullets back into him.

She left Earth for the stars.Fear Itself: Youth In Revolt #1-6 Powers and abilities As her powers are based upon the Asgardians, Thor Girl possesses the conventional physical attributes of the Asgardian gods. She is immune to all Earthly diseases and is highly durable, able to withstand attacks which would destroy an ordinary human. She also will heal at incredible speeds due to her godly life force. Thor Girl possesses superhuman strength which rivals the most powerful of the gods and her now Asgardian-level metabolism provides her with far greater than human endurance in all physical activities. Additionally, like most Asgardians, she is near-ageless with a lifetime which may stretch into several millennia. As Thor Girl, Tarene wields a gold hammer through which she could channel her powers as a continuous beam of energy capable of knocking Thor off his feet and shattering buildings. Like Thor, she can also use her hammer to fly and control the weather, allowing her to summon storms, gusts of wind, create lightning bolts and various other effects. She can also traverse dimensional barriers such as from Earth to Asgard. When she had her cosmic powers, the full extent of what she could do was unknown, but it was stated her powers were on a level that closely rivaled Odin's.

B. Priestley in 1937 illustrating J. W. Dunne's Theory of Time through the experience of a moneyed Yorkshire family, the Conways, over a period of nineteen years from 1919 to 1937. Widely regarded as one of the best of Priestley's Time Plays, a series of pieces for theatre which played with different concepts of Time (the others including I Have Been Here Before, Dangerous Corner and An Inspector Calls), it continues to be revived in the UK regularly. Plot Time and the Conways is in three acts. The first act is set in the Conway house in 1919 on the night of the birthday of one of the daughters, Kay. Act Two moves to the same night in 1937 and is set in the same room in the house. Act Three then returns to 1919, seconds after Act One left off. In the first Act we meet the Conway family, Mrs Conway, her daughters Kay, Hazel, Madge and Carol and her sons Alan and Robin. Three other characters appear: Gerald, a solicitor; Joan, a young woman in love with Robin; and Ernest, a young, ambitious entrepreneur of a lower social class. Act One's atmosphere is one of festivity as the family celebrates the end of the War and look forward to great future of fame, prosperity and fulfilled dreams. In a pensive moment when Kay is left alone on stage she seems to slip into a reverie and has a vision of the future... Act Two plunges us into the shattered lives of the Conways exactly twenty years later. Gathering in the same room where they were celebrating in Act One we see how their lives have failed in different ways. Robin has become a dissolute travelling salesman, estranged from his wife Joan, Madge has failed to realise her socialist dreams, Carol is dead, Hazel is married to the sadistic but wealthy Ernest. Kay has succeeded to a certain extent as an independent woman but has not realised her dreams of novel writing. Worst of all, Mrs Conway's fortune has been squandered, the family home is to be sold and the children's inheritance is gone. As the Act unfolds resentments and tensions explode and the Conways are split apart by misery and grief. Only Alan, the quietest of the family, seems to possess a quiet calm. In the final scene of the Act, Alan and Kay are left on stage and, as Kay expresses her misery Alan suggests to her that the secret of life is to understand its true reality ‚Äì that the perception that Time is linear and that we have to grab and take what we can before we die is false. If we can see Time as eternally present, that at any given moment we are seeing only 'a cross section of ourselves,' then we can transcend our suffering and find no need to hurt or have conflict with other people. Act Three returns us to 1919 and we see how the seeds of the downfall of the Conways were being sown even then. Ernest is snubbed by Hazel and Mrs Conway, Gerald's budding love for Madge is destroyed by the snobbery of Mrs Conway in another moment of social arrogance, Alan is rejected by Joan who becomes betrothed to Robin. As the children gather at the end of the play for Mrs. Conway to foretell their future, Kay has a moment of memory of the vision of Act Two we have seen unfold. Disturbed, she steps out of the party and the play ends with Alan promising that he will be able to tell her something in the future which will help her. About the play The play works on the level of a universal human tragedy and a powerful portrait of the history of Britain between the Wars. Priestley shows how through a process of complacency and class arrogance, Britain allowed itself to decline and collapse between 1919 and 1937, instead of realizing the availability of immense creative and humanistic potential accessible during the post-war (the Great War) generation. Priestley could clearly see the tide of history leading towards another major European conflict as he has his character Ernest comment in 1937 that they are coming to 'the next war'. Thus Time and the Conways operates on many different levels ‚Äì a political history of Britain between the wars, a universal tragedy, a family romance and a metaphysical examination of Time. As such it is one of Priestley's most accomplished and many-layered works for the stage, combining as it does an extremely accessible naturalistic style, heavily tinged with dramatic irony, with a network of sophisticated ideas and insights, which combine to make it one of his most popular plays. The play emerged from Priestley's reading of J. W. Dunne's book An Experiment with Time in which Dunne posits that all time is happening simultaneously; i.e., that past, present, future are one and that linear time is only the way in which human consciousness is able to perceive this. Priestley uses the idea to show how human beings experience loss, failure and the death of their dreams but also how, if they could experience reality in its transcendent nature, they might find a way out. The idea is not dissimilar to that presented by mysticism and religion that if human beings could understand the transcendent nature of their existence the need for greed and conflict would come to an end.

She has published two biographies, Remembering Weary (1996) on Edward Dunlop (1907‚Äì1993), and Remembering Bradman (2002) on Donald Bradman (1908‚Äì2001), using the recollections of people known to the subjects. Readings reviewer felt that with Remembering Bradman Geddes \\"builds up a remarkable and refreshingly human picture of Don Bradman and gives the first real insight into the private world of this great Australian\\". Geddes travelled throughout Australia, England, Scotland and Italy to interview people on their experiences during World War II for her 2004 book, Blood, Sweat and Tears. That book's illustrations were included in a folio which helped the artist, Miriam Rosenbloom, win the Hachette Livre Australia Young Designer of the Year award. ABC-TV's 2004 documentary, Bradman: Reflections on the Legend, features Geddes providing information on the man's life. In 2008 Geddes won a Creative Fellowship sponsored by State Library of Victoria which resulted in her booklet, Fighting for peace: Victorian women peace activists in WWI. In July 2010 she presented it in a multimedia format discussing \\"the part played by religion, politics, class and personality in womens peace and anti-conscription organisations in Victoria during WWI\\". In 2011 Geddes joined the Centre for Adult Education and taught courses in Editing and Non-Fiction. Bibliography Non-fiction  . Biography  . * .

Early life Bhandarkar was born in Malvan in Sindhudurg district of Maharashtra in a Goud Saraswat Brahmin family. After early schooling in Ratnagiri, he studied at Elphinstone College in Bombay. Along with Mahadev Govind Ranade, Bhandarkar was among the first graduates in 1862 from Bombay University. He obtained his Master‚Äôs degree the following year, and was awarded a PhD from University of G√∂ttingen in 1885. Career Bhandarkar taught at Elphinstone College,(Mumbai) and Deccan College (Pune) during his distinguished teaching career. He was involved in research and writing throughout his life. He retired in 1894 as the Vice Chancellor of Bombay University. He participated in international conferences on Oriental Studies held in London (1874) and Vienna (1886), making invaluable contributions. Historian R. S. Sharma wrote of him: \\"He reconstructed the political history of the Deccan of the Satavahanas and the history of Vaishnavism and other sects. A great social reformer, through his researches he advocated widow marriages and castigated the evils of the caste system and child marriage.\\" As an educationist, he was elected to the Council of India in 1903 as a non-official member. Gopal Krishna Gokhale was another member to the Council. In 1911 Bhandarkar was awarded by the British colonial government of India with the title of Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire.Tikekar, Aroon and Tikekara, Aruna (2006), The Cloister's Pale: A Biography of the University of Mumbai, page 27, Popular Prakashan, Mumbai, India Social reformer In 1853, while a student, Bhandarkar became a member of the Paramhansa Sabha, an association for furthering liberal ideas which was then secret to avoid the wrath of the powerful and orthodox elements of contemporary society. Visits from Keshub Chandra Sen during 1864 had inspired the members of the Sabha. Prarthana Samaj In 1866, some of the members held a meeting at the home of Atmaram Pandurang and publicly pledged to certain reforms, including: #Denunciation of the caste system #encouragement of widow remarriage #encouragement of female education #abolition of child marriage. The members concluded that religious reforms were required as a basis for social reforms. They held their first prayer meeting on 31 March 1867, which eventually led to the formation of the Prarthana Samaj. Another visit by Keshub Chunder Sen and visits of Protap Chunder Mozoomdar and Navina Chandra Rai, founder of Punjab Brahmo Samaj, boosted their efforts. Girls' Education Huzurpaga Campus In 1885, Bhandarkar along with noted social reformers Vaman Abaji Modak, and Justice Ranade established the Maharashtra Girls Education Society (MGE) .Ghurye, G. S.

In their hands the comic immediately diverged from the cartoon series into unique new story arcs, often incorporating social, environmentalist, and animal rights themes. It also introduced several new characters of various races and backgrounds, including humans, mutants, aliens, and other anthropomorphic creatures. The stories were often seen as \\"deeper\\" and more \\"serious\\" than the cartoon. During that period, Murphy co- created the characters Jagwar, Nova Posse, Snake-Eyes, and Sarnath; he united several of the series' recurring characters as a separate team, the Mighty Mutanimals.

History Mikindani is an old Swahili port that was a centre of trade in southern Tanzania during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The original inhabitants (the Makonde people) were joined around the ninth Century AD by Arab traders. A further influx of Arabs occurred in the 19th century under the reign of Seyyid Said, the graves and mosques from this period can still be seen. In the late 19th century under German colonial rule trade in the area's natural resources of rubber, sisal, coconuts and oil seed grew. The boma (fort), a slave market, a prison and a dock were constructed in the village. During World War I the prison was largely destroyed, what remained was turned into a customs house. With the arrival of the British at the end of the First World War, Mikindani remained an important administrative post and attracted a sizeable Indian population (there is still an Indian temple) until 1947 when the British administration developed the port in neighbouring Mtwara for exporting peanuts grown as part of the infamous Tanganyika groundnut scheme. As the centre for trade and administration moved to Mtwara, Mikindani's focus shifted back to fishing and agriculture. The town declined further through the unwise nationalizations by the Tanzanian government that drove away most of the Indian and Arab settlers, and left the town a beautiful ruin frozen in time. Due to its proximity to the Northern border of Mozambique and the lack of communications - the road to Dar es Salaam was still under construction - the whole area remained relatively unexplored; the area was off-limits to tourists during the 1977 - 1994 Mozambican Civil War. The town is home to 'Livingstone House', that owes its name to the fact that the town is assumed to be the point of departure of Livingstone's last expedition. The building as such never housed Livingstone, and was erected long after his departure. It is likely that Livingstone's final departure point would in fact have been nearby Pemba on the northern side of the mouth of the lagoon rather than this location in the centre of Mikindani. Geography Top left clockwise the lounge, the outdoor swimming pool, a bedroom and the stair cases of the Old Boma hotel. Mikindani town is located on the gently sloping hills of the southern coast of Mikindani Harbour, a small roughly heart shaped natural harbour off Mikindani Bay. With a narrow entrance to the harbour, it was a welcome respite from the perils of the unpredictable Indian Ocean for explorers in the 18th and 19th centuries. The southern arm of the harbour mouth contains a small collection of houses (and a holiday complex) called Litingi. On the far side of the mouth is a small village called Pemba. There are salt pans located just past the mouth of the bay, on the ocean side. The Town is located on the main Mtwara-Lindi road, about 10 km from Mtwara. The town can easily be reached from Mtwara via regular dala dala services. The Modern Town After local administrative offices moved to Mtwara in 1947, Mikindani's fortunes declined. However, the town has since seen an increase in prosperity over the past decade, starting with the renovation of the boma as a hotel in the late 1990s. Today Mikindani is a fascinating old town with winding streets and an interesting blend of local and Arabic influenced architecture with roofed terraces, sculpted doors and thick coral stone walls. Arab buildings from the 17th century still stand in the town today, though most buildings were erected during the first half of the twentieth century in the old Swahili style. It has a small number of hotels, bars and restaurants, and more recently a yacht club has been founded. It is also becoming known as one of Tanzania's unexplored diving locations. However, despite these developments, the majority of the population exist on subsistence farming and artisanal fishing, selling a small amount of their surplus. The town is predominantly Muslim although there is a sizable Christian population.  Images of Mikindani  Image:Boys in Mikindani, Tanzania.JPGBoys posing for the camera near the bay at Mikindani.

Davies has also been capped by Wales at international level. His usual position is at full back. Davies joined Llanelli as a 19-year-old from Carmarthen Athletic. He has since made over 100 appearances for Llanelli and the Llanelli Scarlets. During his career at Stradey Park he became the region's top try scorer, racking up 37 tries in his lengthy stay at the region. Davies was first included in the Welsh squad in 2004, for a series of mid-year tests, after scoring a memorable try for the Scarlets against Northampton Saints in the Heineken Cup pool stages, where the Scarlets needed to win the game to qualify for the quarter- finals, which they accomplished. This try provoked reaction all over the Welsh Rugby world and earned Davies a Wales call up. He was an unused bench replacement in a match against Argentina on 19 June. He made his debut for Wales in early 2006, during the Six Nations that year. He came off the bench in a match against Ireland at Lansdowne Road, which Wales lost 31‚Äì5. It came to light quite late in his Llanelli Scarlets career that Davies was quite a remarkable goal kicker. During and ever since the 2003 season, Davies would attempt kicks at goal from long distances. His greatest kick was against Ulster in the Celtic League at Ravenhill from an estimated distance of 59 metres. Though he did not perform these kicks often, it was this sort of play on the pitch that earned him the nickname 'Barry the boot' from one commentator during the EDF Energy and then again during the Powergen Cup semi- final against Bath. In 2007, Davies joined French club CA Brive, and in June 2009, he joined the Ospreys. He was released by the Ospreys in July 2012.

The drama has a total of 17 episodes. Synopsis Park, Jang and Roh were bossom friends as youths, along with Sa-yeong and Miri. Park and Jang later became entrepreneurs when they grew up. One day, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Park and his company encountered gangsters who attempted assassination upon him. The company, one driving in a Perak-registered turquoise Volvo and the other in a Kuala-Lumpur registered bluish-purple Proton Wira was chased by one gangster on a motorbike and his company. As they drove through a road surrounded by woods, the company stopped their car and took out their revolvers to shoot the gangsters, and hit the one riding on a motorbike, who fell off as he was riding on it. Meanwhile, the gangster's Malay accomplices attempted to restart the car. Da-yeong faced several reporters who interviewed him about the ordeal. As he was about to enter the (black) car, an assassin hiding in the bushes fired his sniper, and the bullet hit right on Da-yeong's head. Jun-ki, whose face was splashed with his father's blood, shouted out and carried his mortally wounded father who was staggering. Final episode The trio were being pursued after by Ahn's gangsters, and were being beaten up by gangsters when Ahn learnt that the tape containing his secret message. Park was nearly strangled to death by a gangster, but was being saved by Roh. Back home, his (newly-wed) wife Sa-yeong put the videotape into his coat. As Park saw his mother off, they reminded each other to take care of themselves. Later, Bum- soo was driving a quiet road and was being pursued by two gangsters on a motorbike. Jun-ki's mother was being robbed of the videotape, and Bum-soo, stopped his car as the gangsters smashed his windscreen. He was being beaten up, and the gangsters left. Jun-ki and Ji-mun later faced a similar fate by gangsters riding on two heavy trucks. The videotaped was being trampled and they were being beaten up, before the gangsters left. Ahn overheard Miri's conversation with Bum-soo outside the office, and ordered his henchman to drug her at the carpark. She was being drugged at the carpark as she was opening her car door. She was taken to the beach, and was forced to call the trio, starting from Bum-soo, claiming that she had found evidence of Ahn's statements. When she called Jun-ki and Ji-mun, Jun-ki urged Ji-mun to get to the scheduled location immediately, who hesitated. Bum-soo arrived at the scheduled location, who felt rather puzzled to why Miri had asked to meet at such a desolate place. The gangsters, hiding below the seats of their car. Miri tried to whisper to him to escape, who couldn't comprehend what she was trying to convene. A car then came charging towards them, and Miri pushed Bum- soo away, herself getting hit instead, smashing the car's windscreen. At this time, Jun-ki and Ji-mun came rushing, with the police following behind. The gangsters put up a short fight before leaving the scene, and Jun-ki gave a very brief chase. Jun-ki discovered Dong-kwon in the car, and locked him in handcuffs. As he searched his pockets, he managed to seize a pager containing the statements Dong-kwon spoke. Bum-soo ran towards Miri, who was lying on the floor with a big gash on her forehead. In Bum-soo's arms, Miri whispered to the trio, of which Bum-soo and Jun-ki rushed near the couple to hear her final words. Miri died, and Bum-soo burst into tears. Bum-soo and Jun-ki looked very solemn upon their friend's death. Back home, Jun-ki told his wife that all evidence had been destroyed, and expressed his displeasure. His wife took out a DVD casing meant to hold the DVD of an action film, and opened out to a video cassette. She told him that she had made a backup copy, and Jun-ki hugged her in his arms. At the court, in front of the media, Bum-soo publicised Dong-kwon's statement in the pager, by playing the audio clip and playing it near the microphone. His statement was heard by everybody in the court, and also showed a video tape of Dong-kwon's atrocities. Bum-soo continued his statement of Dong-kwon's criminal activities in Korea and Malaysia, and that he would resort to all means to end corruption, even at the expense of the death his most beloved girlfriend and Jun-ki's father Da-yeong. Later, Jun-ki and Ji-mun accompanied Bum-soo to scatter Miri's ashes along the riverbank. He expressed that he wished that Miri would not suffer the winter wind as he scattered the ashes. The two friends, standing behind, looked rather solemn in their black coats. Afterwards, they made a promise to help each other in times of need, and the trio knocked their knuckles against one another.

A farmer field school (FFS) is a group-based learning process that has been used by a number of governments, NGOs, and international agencies to promote integrated pest management (IPM). The first FFSs were designed and managed by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization in Indonesia in 1989. Since then, more than two million farmers across Asia have participated in this type of learning. A farmer field school brings together concepts and methods from agroecology, experiential education and community development. As a result, hundreds of thousands of rice farmers in countries such as China, India, Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam have been able to reduce the use of pesticides and improve the sustainability of crop yields. FFSs have also produced other developmental benefits that are broadly described as 'empowerment': FFS alumni in a number of countries are involved in a wide range of self-directed activities including research, training, marketing, and advocacy.From farmers field schools to community IPM: scaling up the IPM movement, Russ Dilts. 2001. LEISA magazine. 17/3  Origins  Almost one third of the world's population are members of farming households in Asia. Most of these farming families are small holders. Forty years ago, the Green Revolution was launched with the aim of improving the productivity of small farmers. By improving access to water, improved varieties, and other inputs, the Green Revolution helped to double average rice yields between the 1960s and the 1990s. During the 1970s it became increasingly apparent that pest resistance and resurgence caused by the indiscriminate use of insecticides posed an immediate threat to the gains of the Green Revolution. At the same time, research was being conducted that demonstrated the viability of biological control of major rice pests. However, gaps still existed between the science generated in research institutions and common farmer practice conditioned by years of aggressive promotion of pesticide use. Over the ensuing years, a number of approaches were tried to bring integrated pest management (IPM) to small farmers - particularly rice farmers ‚Äì in Asia, with mixed results. Some experts claimed that the principles of IPM were too complex for small farmers to master, and that centrally designed messages were still the only way to convince farmers to change their practices. By the end of the 1980s, a new approach to farmer training emerged in Indonesia called the 'Farmer Field School' (FFS). The broad problem which these field schools were designed to address was a lack of knowledge among Asian farmers relating to agroecology, particularly the relationship between insect pests and beneficial insects.Ecological Basis for Low-toxicity Integrated Pest Management (IPM) in Rice and Vegetables, Kevin Gallagher et al. In, Jules Pretty, The Pesticide Detox. 2005. Earthscan The implementation of projects using the FFS approach led to a deeper understanding of the problem and its causes. It was recognised that sustainable agricultural development required more than just the acquisition of ecological knowledge by individual farmers. It also required the development of a capability for generating, adapting and extending this knowledge within farming communities. The weakness of this capability in most farming communities is itself an important problem; one which has often been exacerbated by earlier agricultural development programmes that fostered a dependency on external sources of expertise. This deeper understanding of the problem was first recognised by farmers in Indonesia who graduated from FFS but realised there was more they could do to improve rural livelihoods. They started to organise new groups, alliances, networks and associations, and became involved in planning and implementing their own interventions. These interventions were highly diverse, ranging from research and training, to marketing and advocacy work. In response to the activities of these groups, IPM projects started to support the idea of 'Community IPM', which gave considerable attention to organisational issues rather than focussing solely on technological and educational aspects of IPM.Kaligondang: A Case History of an IPM Sub-district, Susianto, A, Purwadi, D, Pontius, J. 1998. FAO  Description  A farmer field school (FFS) is a group-based learning process. During an FFS, farmers carried out experiential learning activities that helped them understand the ecology of their rice fields. These activities involve simple experiments, regular field observations and group analysis. The knowledge gained from these activities enables participants to make their own locally specific decisions about crop management practices. This approach represents a radical departure from earlier agricultural extension programmes, in which farmers were expected to adopt generalized recommendations that had been formulated by specialists from outside the community. The basic features of a typical rice IPM Farmer Field School are as follows:Ten Years of IPM Training in Asia - From Farmer Field School to Community IPM, Pontius, J, Dilts, R, Bartlett, A. 2002, FAO Farmer Field Schools for IPM - Refresh your Memory, Bijlmakers, H. 2005, IPM DANIDA *The IPM Field School is field based and lasts for a full cropping season. *A rice FFS meets once a week with a total number of meetings that might range from at least 10 up to 16 meetings. *The primary learning material at a Farmers Field School is the rice field. *The Field School meeting place is close to the learning plots often in a farmer's home and sometimes beneath a convenient tree. *FFS educational methods are experiential, participatory, and learner centred. *Each FFS meeting includes at least three activities: the agro-ecosystem analysis, a \\"special topic\\", and a group dynamics activity. *In every FFS, participants conduct a study comparing IPM with non-IPM treated plots. *An FFS often includes several additional field studies depending on local field problems. *Between 25 and 30 farmers participate in a FFS. Participants learn together in small groups of five to maximise participation. *All FFSs include a Field Day in which farmers make presentations about IPM and the results of their studies. *A pre- and post-test is conducted as part of every Field School for diagnostic purposes and for determining follow-up activities. *The facilitators of FFS's undergo intensive season-long residential training to prepare them for organising and conducting Field Schools. *Preparation meetings precede an FFS to determine needs, recruit participants, and develop a learning contract. *Final meetings of the FFS often include planning for follow-up activities. Although Farmer Field Schools were designed to promote IPM, empowerment has an essential feature from the beginning. The curriculum of the FFS was built on the assumption that farmers could only implement IPM once they had acquired the ability to carry out their own analysis, make their own decisions and organise their own activities. The empowerment process, rather than the adoption of specific IPM techniques, is what produces many of the developmental benefits of the FFS  FAO support in Asia  The first IPM Farmer Field Schools were designed and managed in 1989 by experts working for the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in Indonesia. This was not, however, the first attempt made by FAO to extend IPM techniques to farmers in South East Asia. The FAO Intercountry Programme for the Development and Application of Integrated Pest Control in Rice in South and South-East Asia started in 1980, building on the experience of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and Bureau of Plant Industry in the Philippines. Over the following two decades the Intercountry Programme (ICP) played a leading role in the promotion of rice IPM in Asia, giving rise to numerous other projects and programmes. By the time of completion in 2002, the ICP had a cumulative budget of $45 million, which had been spent on training activities in 12 countries (Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Nepal, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam). The ICP was not the only IPM programme supported by FAO during this period. Essential to the development of the FFS was a National IPM Programme in Indonesia, which ran between 1989 and 2000, funded by the United States ($ 25 million grant), World Bank ($ 37 million loan) and the Government ($ 14 million). FAO provided technical assistance to the National IPM Programme through a team of experts based in Indonesia, with back-stopping from the ICP. National projects were also developed and supported by FAO on a smaller scale in Bangladesh, Cambodia, China and Nepal. Additionally, the ICP launched 'spin-off' regional programmes focusing on IPM in cotton and vegetables. In total, during the 15-year period between 1989 and 2004, approximately $100 million in grants were allocated to IPM projects in Asia that used the FFS approach under the guidance of FAO Farmer Field Schools to promote Integrated Pest Management in Asia: the FAO experience, Andrew Bartlett. 2005. Workshop on Scaling Up Case Studies in Agriculture. IRRI.  Costs and benefits  Homestead vegetable producers attending FFS in Bangladesh, 2004, organised by CAREThere are two major reasons why it is difficult to make generalisations about the costs and benefits of IPM field schools. Firstly, there is a lack of agreement about what factors should be taken into account on both sides of the cost-benefit equation. Regarding benefits, should we limit ourselves to measuring yields and pesticide savings, or should we also take account of improvements in public health and the consequences of farmers becoming better organised? Regarding costs, should we limit ourselves to the expenses involved in running field schools, or should we also take account of the wider costs of training extension staff and managing IPM programmes. Secondly, there is a high degree of variation in the value of individual factors. The cost of conducting a season-long field school for 25 farmers has ranged from $150 to $1,000 depending on the country and the organisation. In some cases, the graduates of FFS have saved $40 per hectare per season by eliminating pesticides without any loss of yield. In other cases, graduates did not experience any savings because they were not previously using any pesticides, but yields increased by as much as 25% as a result of adopting other practices learnt during the FFS, such as improved varieties, better water management and enhanced plant nutrition. The conceptual and methodological problems associated with assessing the impact of IPM field schools have resulted in disagreements among experts about the advantages of this intervention . One widely circulated paper written by World Bank economists has questioned the benefit of 'sending farmers back to school'.Sending Farmers Back to School: The impact of Farmer Field Schools in Indonesia, Feder, G, Murgai, R and Quizon, J.B. 2004. Review of Agricultural Economics, 26(1), 45-62 By contrast, a meta-analysis of 25 impact studies commissioned by FAO concluded: Despite the arguments amongst economists and policy makers, there has been widespread enthusiasm for IPM and FFS among farmers and development practitioners in a number of Asian countries. Participation in FFS has always been voluntary, and none of the IPM projects and programmes supported by FAO provided financial incentives to participants. On the contrary, participation in FFS has always involved a considerable cost in terms of time and effort. Despite these costs, two million farmers decided to participate. In most countries, the demand for places on a field school has been ahead of supply, and drop-out rates have been very low. Furthermore, there are many examples of farmers who decided to train other members of their community and continue working as a group after the training came to an end.

Presently he is a Schwartz Senior Fellow at the New America Foundation, and he formerly worked as a senior writer and deputy assistant managing editor at U.S. News & World Report. Personal life and education The son of Kenneth and Mary Longman, who worked in Baden- W√ºrttemberg as a result of the postwar occupation of that state by the US military, Phillip Longman spent most of his childhood in Princeton, New Jersey. He studied at Oberlin College and later obtained a Knight-Baghot fellowship at Columbia University. Phillip Longman was originally married to Robin Longman, but after she died he married Sandy Garbrecht. They have one son, Sam, and reside in Washington, D.C. Career Focusing his attention on how demographic and social change interact and affect government finance, the environment, foreign policy, and the development of society generally, Longman published his first book, Born to Pay: The New Politics of Aging in America in 1987. In the following decade wrote many articles about the impact of aging populations on society in the future. During this period, his name became much more widely known in the academic community: his articles became published by such journals as The Atlantic Monthly, Financial Times, Harvard Business Review, Foreign Affairs and The New Republic. In 1997 Longman published his second book The Return of Thrift: How the Collapse of the Middle Class Welfare State will Reawaken Values in America, which argued that people today are spending in an unsustainable manner with the accelerating decline in fertility rates threatening the financial collapse of the welfare state throughout the world. By 2000 he had linked with the New America Foundation and began work on his most widely read work, The Empty Cradle in March 2004. This book expressed his strongly held opinion that sub-replacement fertility and resultant population decline is likely to have catastrophic economic consequences for those nations suffering from it and is also likely to reduce societies' ability to adjust to newly emerging problems because of unwillingness to innovate or take risks. It also examines the present effect of the rapid fall in birth rates around the globe. His research into the history of demographic decline in ancient Greece and Rome led to an article titled The Return of Patriarchy in the March, 2006 issue of Foreign Policy, and in other journals in an edited form under the title The Liberal Baby Bust. On January 1, 2007, his fourth full-length book was published by PoliPointPress. Titled Best Care Anywhere: Why VA Healthcare is Better Than Yours, it reflects on Longman's loss of his first wife to cancer and aims to show that in fact private health insurance is not superior to public health care as is often presumed. More than 60 peer-reviewed studies, he wrote, show that the quality of V.A. care is comparable to, and in many key areas superior to, that offered by private providers.Room for Debate: Should the Veterans Health Care System be Privatized?

Waldensian presence  the waldensian temple in Pra del torno. The valley of Angrogna, Val di Angrogna, situated in the Cottian Alps between Piedmont and France has historic significance for the Waldensian Church. A narrow Alpine valley starting in Val Pellice, the valley of Angrogna ends at the village of Pra del Torno which was the location of a Waldensian mission centre during The Middle Ages. Due to its narrowness, the valley was a military and religious refuge for the Waldensians and Pra del Torno were the centre of Waldensian resistance from the 13th to the 18th centuries. As evidence of their persecutions, there is still a sort of catacomb located near the village of San Lorenzo. In pre-Reformation times Waldensian missionaries were trained in a college at Pra del Torno by 'barbes', their pastors, to work as traders spreading their message across Europe. The ruins of this college still exist. There are both Catholic and Waldensian churches today situated at Pra del Torno, as well as in a number of other villages in the valley. Angrona was selected as the Waldensian refuge from Papal armies under Papal legate, Cataneo in 1488. Cataneo was charged by a Papal Bull to destroy the 'heretic' populations of the Waldensian valleys but the Waldensians defenders were able to repel the Papal troops' just outside Pra del Torno and protect their main population in the village from massacre. In 1532, at Chanforan in Angrogna, a Waldensian synod of churches in France, Calabria and Apulia took the decision that the Waldensian Church should join the Protestant Reformation which their doctrines had prefigured. The Waldensians in Angrogna suffered fierce persecutions throughout the 17th century but were supported by Oliver Cromwell and William of Orange. In 1686, Vittorio Amedeo II, in accordance with the policy of Louis XIV of France, began the systematic expulsion of the Waldensian valleys. Local troops destroyed the houses of Waldensians and their land in the valley was expropriated and sold to Catholics coming from elsewhere in Piedmont. After reconciling with Victor Amadeus, the Waldensians returned to their land and homes in the valley. Charles Albert of Savoy gave the Waldenses freedom to worship, in February 1848. In the 19th century, British supporters of the Waldensians, who funded the Waldensian headquarters in nearby Torre Pellice founded a primary school for Waldensian children living in Angrogna.

Her research topics included Teichm√ºller theory, hyperbolic geometry, ergodic theory, and symplectic geometry. In 2005, as a result of her research, she was honored in Popular Science's fourth annual \\"Brilliant 10\\" in which she was acknowledged as one of the top 10 young minds who have pushed their fields in innovative directions. On 13 August 2014, Mirzakhani was honored with the Fields Medal, the most prestigious award in mathematics. Thus, she became both the first, and to date, the only woman and the first Iranian to be honored with the award. The award committee cited her work in \\"the dynamics and geometry of Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces\\". On 14 July 2017, Mirzakhani died of breast cancer at the age of 40.  Early life and education  Mirzakhani was born on 12 May 1977 in Tehran, Iran. As a child, she attended Tehran Farzanegan School, part of the National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents (NODET). In her junior and senior year of high school, she won the gold medal for mathematics in the Iranian National Olympiad, thus allowing her to bypass the national college entrance exams. In 1994, Mirzakhani achieved the gold medal level in the International Mathematical Olympiad in Hong Kong, scoring 41 out of 42 points. She was the first female Iranian student to do so. The following year, in 1995, she became the first Iranian student to achieve a perfect score and to win two gold medals in the International Mathematical Olympiad held in Toronto. Later in her life, she collaborated with friend, colleague, and Olympiad silver medalist, Roya Beheshti Zavareh (), on their book Elementary Number Theory, Challenging Problems which was published in 1999. Mirzakhani and Zavareh together were the first women to compete in the Iranian National Mathematical Olympiad and won gold and silver medals respectively in 1995. On 17 March 1998, after attending a conference consisting of gifted individuals and former Olympiad competitors, Mirzakhani and Zavareh, along with other attendees boarded a bus in Ahvaz en route to Tehran. The bus was involved in an accident wherein it fell off a cliff, killing seven of the passengers‚Äîall Sharif University students. This incident is widely considered to be a national tragedy in Iran. Mirzakhani and Zavareh were two of the few survivors. In 1999, she obtained a Bachelor of Science in mathematics from the Sharif University of Technology. During her time there, she received recognition from the American Mathematical Society for her work in developing a simple proof for a theorem of Schur. She then went to the United States for graduate work, earning a PhD in 2004 from Harvard University, where she worked under the supervision of the Fields Medalist Curtis T. McMullen. At Harvard she is said to have been \\"distinguished by ... determination and relentless questioning\\". She used to take her class notes in Persian.  Career  Mirzakhani was a 2004 research fellow of the Clay Mathematics Institute and a professor at Princeton University. In 2009, she became a professor at Stanford University.  Research work  Maryam Mirzakhani, August 2014 Mirzakhani made several contributions to the theory of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces. Mirzakhani's early work solved the problem of counting simple closed geodesics on hyperbolic Riemann surfaces by finding a relationship to volume calculations on moduli space. Geodesics are the natural generalization of the idea of a \\"straight line\\" to \\"curved spaces\\". Slightly more formally, a curve is a geodesic if no slight deformation can make it shorter. Closed geodesics are geodesics which are also closed curves‚Äîthat is, they are curves that close up into loops. A closed geodesic is simple if it does not cross itself. A previous result, known as the \\"prime number theorem for geodesics\\", established that the number of closed geodesics of length less than L grows exponentially with L ‚Äì it is asymptotic to e^L/L. However, the analogous counting problem for simple closed geodesics remained open, despite being \\"the key object to unlocking the structure and geometry of the whole surface,\\" according to University of Chicago topologist Benson Farb. Mirzakhani's 2004 PhD thesis solved this problem, showing that the number of simple closed geodesics of length less than L is polynomial in L. Explicitly, it is asymptotic to cL^{6g-6}, where g is the genus (roughly, the number of \\"holes\\") and c is a constant depending on the hyperbolic structure. This result can be seen as a generalization of the theorem of the three geodesics for spherical surfaces. Mirzakhani solved this counting problem by relating it to the problem of computing volumes in moduli space‚Äîa space whose points correspond to different complex structures on a surface genus g. In her thesis, Mirzakhani found a volume formula for the moduli space of bordered Riemann surfaces of genus g with n geodesic boundary components. From this formula followed the counting for simple closed geodesics mentioned above, as well as a number of other results. This led her to obtain a new proof for the formula discovered by Edward Witten and Maxim Kontsevich on the intersection numbers of tautological classes on moduli space. Her subsequent work focused on Teichm√ºller dynamics of moduli space. In particular, she was able to prove the long-standing conjecture that William Thurston's earthquake flow on Teichm√ºller space is ergodic. One can construct a simple earthquake map by cutting a surface along a finite number of disjoint simple closed geodesics, sliding the edges of each of these cut past each other by some amount, and closing the surface back up. One can imagine the surface being cut by strike- slip faults. An earthquake is a sort of limit of simple earthquakes, where one has an infinite number of geodesics, and instead of attaching a positive real number to each geodesic one puts a measure on them. In 2014, with Alex Eskin and with input from Amir Mohammadi, Mirzakhani proved that complex geodesics and their closures in moduli space are surprisingly regular, rather than irregular or fractal. The closures of complex geodesics are algebraic objects defined in terms of polynomials and therefore they have certain rigidity properties, which is analogous to a celebrated result that Marina Ratner arrived at during the 1990s. The International Mathematical Union said in its press release that \\"It is astounding to find that the rigidity in homogeneous spaces has an echo in the inhomogeneous world of moduli space.\\"  Awarding of Fields Medal  Four Fields medallists left to right Artur Avila, Martin Hairer (at back), Maryam Mirzakhani (with her daughter Anahita) and Manjul Bhargava at the ICM 2014 in Seoul Mirzakhani was awarded the Fields Medal in 2014 for \\"her outstanding contributions to the dynamics and geometry of Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces\\". The award was made in Seoul at the International Congress of Mathematicians on 13 August. At the time of the award, Jordan Ellenberg explained her research to a popular audience: In 2014, President Hassan Rouhani of Iran congratulated her for winning the topmost world mathematics prize. Mirzakhani has an Erd≈ës number of 3.  Personal life  In 2008, Mirzakhani married Jan Vondr√°k, a Czech theoretical computer scientist and applied mathematician who currently is an associate professor at Stanford University. They have a daughter named Anahita.\\"A Tenacious Explorer of Abstract Surfaces\\" , simonsfoundation.org. Retrieved 13 April 2014. Mirzakhani lived in Palo Alto, California. Mirzakhani described herself as a \\"slow\\" mathematician, saying that \\"you have to spend some energy and effort to see the beauty of math.\\" To solve problems, Mirzakhani would draw doodles on sheets of paper and write mathematical formulas around the drawings. Her daughter described her mother's work as \\"painting\\". She declared:  Death and legacy  Mirzakhani was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2013. In 2016, the cancer spread to her bones and liver, and she died on 14 July 2017 at the age of 40 at Stanford Hospital in Stanford, California. Iranian president Hassan Rouhani and other officials offered their condolences and praised Mirzakhani's scientific achievements. Rouhani said in his message that \\"the unprecedented brilliance of this creative scientist and modest human being, who made Iran's name resonate in the world's scientific forums, was a turning point in showing the great will of Iranian women and young people on the path towards reaching the peaks of glory and in various international arenas.\\" Upon her death, several Iranian newspapers, along with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, broke taboo and published photographs of Mirzakhani with her hair uncovered, a gesture that was widely noted in the press and on social media. Mirzakhani's death has also renewed debates within Iran regarding matrilineal citizenship for children of mixed-nationality parentage; Fars News Agency reported that, on the heels of Mirzakhani's death, 60 Iranian MPs urged the speeding up of an amendment to a law that would allow children of Iranian mothers married to foreigners to be given Iranian nationality, in order to make it easier for Mirzakhani's daughter to visit Iran. Plaque for Mirzakhani Hall in IsfahanNumerous obituaries and tributes were published in the days following Maryam Mirzakhani's death. As a result of advocacy carried out by the Women's Committee within the Iranian Mathematical Society (), the International Council for Science has agreed to declare Maryam Mirzakhani's birthday, 12 May, as International Women in Mathematics Day in respect of her memory. Various establishments have also taken after Mirzakhani's namesake in honor of her life and achievements. In 2017, Farzanegan High school ‚Äì the high school Mirzakhani formerly attended ‚Äì named their amphitheater and library after her. Additionally, Sharif University of Technology, the institute wherein Mirzakhani obtained her bachelors, has since named their main library in the College of Mathematics after her. Further, the House of Mathematics in Isfahan, in collaboration with the Mayor, named a conference hall in the city after her. In 2014, students at the University of Oxford founded the Mirzakhani Society, a society for women and non-binary students studying Mathematics at the University of Oxford. Mirzakhani met the society in September 2015, when she visited Oxford. In 2016, Maryam Mirzakhani was made a member of the National Academy of Sciences, making her the first Iranian woman to be officially accepted as a member of the academy. On 2 February 2018, Satellogic, a high-resolution Earth observation imaging and analytics company, launched a √ëuSat type micro-satellite named in honor of Maryam Mirzakhani. In November 4, 2019 The Breakthrough Prize Foundation announced that the Maryam Mirzakhani New Frontiers Prize has been created to be awarded to outstanding women in the field of mathematics each year. The $50,000 award will be presented to early-career mathematicians who have completed their PhDs within the past two years. In February 2020, on International Day of Women and Girls in STEM, Mirzakhani was honoured by UN Women as one of seven female scientists dead or alive who have shaped the world.

It is considered dangerous for sailing vessels to cross because of calms and cross currents. Geography Two miles east-northeast of the south point of Diego Perez Cay is the beginning of the northeast section of the Jardinillos (or Jardines) bank which continues to the southeast of East Rock. East Rock is situated approximately a cable from the northeast end of East Guano Cay, to which it is connected by a reef.

This includes both those who are native to the United States as well as Lebanese immigrants to America. Lebanese Americans comprise 0.79% of the American population as of the American Community Survey estimations for year 2007, and 32.4% of all Americans who originate from the Middle East. Lebanese Americans have had a significant participation in American politics and have had involvement in both social and political activism. The diversity within the region sprouted from the diaspora of the surrounding countries. There are more Lebanese outside Lebanon today than within.  History  The first known Lebanese immigrant to the United States was Antonio Bishallany, a Maronite Christian, who arrived in Boston Harbor in 1854. He died in Brooklyn, New York in 1856 on his 29th birthday. Large scale-Lebanese immigration began in the late 19th century and settled mainly in Brooklyn and Boston, Massachusetts. Although they were marked as Syrians, almost all of the immigrants were Christians from Mount Lebanon. Upon entering America, many of them worked as peddlers. The first wave continued until the 1920s in which an estimated 100,000 Lebanese immigrated to America. Many immigrants settled in Northern New Jersey, in towns such as Bloomfield, Paterson, Newark, and Orange. Some immigrants set out west, with places such as Detroit, Michigan, Toledo, Ohio, and Peoria gaining a large number of all Lebanese immigrants. Others bought farms in states like Texas, South Dakota, and Iowa. Large numbers came via the United Kingdom, including a large number on the ill-fated liner RMS Titanic. The second wave of Lebanese immigration began in the late 1940s and continued through the early 1990s, when Lebanese immigrants had been fleeing the Lebanese Civil War. Between 1948 and 1985, over 60,000 Lebanese entered the United States. Since then, immigration has slowed to an estimated 5,000 immigrants a year, and those who now settle are predominantly Muslim, in contrast to the predominantly-Christian population of immigrants of previous waves, but Christians are still a majority in America and in the diaspora of around 14 million Lebanese people living outside Lebanon. Religion Most of the Lebanese immigrants during the first and the early part of the second waves were Christians. Muslims followed in large numbers beginning in the late 1960s. Among Muslims, the Shi'ite and Sunni communities are the largest. A number of Jews fled Lebanon for the United States due to fears of persecution, and populations of Druze and atheists also exist. This information has been distributed by all American organizations, including the Arab American Institute and the United States census team.  Places with sizable populations  450px Dearborn, Michigan has the highest concentration of Arab Americans in the United States, at over 40%.U.S. Arab population doubles over 20 years - News The rest of Metro Detroit has an even larger population of Lebanese residents. Brooklyn, New York has one of the oldest Lebanese populations in America, dating over 125 years; one large center is in the Bay Ridge section. Once predominantly Christian, the Lebanese in Bay Ridge are today equally split between Muslims and Christians. South Paterson, New Jersey historically had a large Lebanese Christian population dating back to the 1890s, but only a few remain, and the neighborhood has largely been replaced by new Palestinian immigrants. Brooklyn holds a significant Lebanese community, with a Maronite Cathedral the center of one of two eparchies for Maronite Lebanese in the United States, the other being in Los Angeles. Miss USA Rima Fakih is Lebanese American. Utica, New York; San Diego, California; Jacksonville, Florida; Sterling Heights, Michigan; Los Angeles County; San Francisco, California; Peoria, Illinois; Grosse Pointe, Michigan; Miami, Florida; Wichita, Kansas; Bloomfield, Michigan; Fall River, Massachusetts; Worcester, Massachusetts; Boston, Massachusetts; Methuen, Massachusetts; Lawrence, Massachusetts; Salem, New Hampshire; Lansing, Michigan; East Grand Rapids, Michigan; Lafayette, Louisiana; St. Clair Shores, Michigan; Toledo, Ohio and Houston, Texas also have sizeable Lebanese communities.

He received a common school education up to the age of thirteen, and then he spent a number of years working in his father's furniture business. Schuchert possessed an aptitude for scientific investigation, and in 1878 he began to attend meetings of the Cincinnati Society of Natural History.http://www.anb.org/articles/13/13-01474.html?a=1&n;=schuchert&ia;=-at&ib;=-bib&d;=10&ss;=0&q;=1 Here he developed a friendship with fellow Cincinnati native Edward Oscar Ulrich. The two collected and studied fossils from the Cincinnati area for ten years. In 1888, Schuchert moved to Albany, New York to apprentice under James Hall. He was preparator of fossils with Charles E. Beecher at Yale University from 1892 to 1893. He served on the United States Geological Survey from 1893 to 1894. After serving as curator of the U.S. National Museum from 1894 to 1904, Schuchert joined the Yale faculty, succeeding Beecher, the first invertebrate paleontologist there. He served as the director of the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University from 1904 to 1923. He was the first president of the Paleontological Society in 1910.

It has been designated as a Grade II* listed building. Located near the shore of the inlet of Watermouth, near Ilfracombe, Devon, the castle houses a collection of Victorian antiques centred on domestic tools and amusement machines, a family theme park and holiday apartments. The Bassetts left the castle in 1945. Descent of ownership Bassett Rev. John Swete, before demolition and replacement by Watermouth Castle The castle was built by Joseph Davie Bassett (1764-10 December 1846), son of John Davie (died 1793) of Orleigh Court, Buckland Brewer and his wife Eleanora Basset of Heanton Court, Heanton Punchardon. His brother was Rev. Charles Davie (1760‚Äì1836),Heanton Punchardon Church burials file displayed in church. Charles Davie was buried 12/2/1836 aged 76 rector of Heanton Punchardon, which advowson was possessed by the Bassett family. After his mother became the sole heiress of her childless brother Francis Basset (died 1802), Joseph Davie adopted the name Bassett in lieu of his patronymic and adopted the Bassett armorials. He sold Orleigh in 1807 and built Watermouth Castle as his principal residence.Rogers, W.H. Buckland Brewer, 1938, pp. 52‚Äì3 He married Mary Irwin (1777-21/4/1862) of Barnstaple.

It is manufactured by DaimlerChrysler Aerospace in Germany by the name of DWS 24 - Dispenser Weapon System 24 barrels. The BK90 is also commonly known as DWS 39 Mj√∂lner because it was intended for use with the Saab JAS 39 Gripen.http://www.canit.se/~griffon/aviation/text/mjolner.htm In the future it could be also integrated on the Eurofighter Typhoon. Its design is very similar to that of the American AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon.

In conjunction with the LITENING targeting pod, the weapon is currently operational with the Hellenic Air Force carried both by the F-4E PI-2000 AUP and the now retired A-7E Corsair II. Background and reason for development \\"Cluster bombs\\" are notorious for leaving active un- exploded ordnance (UXO) which failed to detonate upon impact. The main task for the Swedish Armed Forces has, for a long time, been to repel a potential foreign invading force. This means all weapon systems are designed for use within Sweden's national borders. For a long time, all weapons using sub- munitions were rejected by the Defence Materiel Administration with the motivation that potentially leaving active UXO was an unacceptable risk. There was a significant need for a weapon that would leave no active UXO, have a smaller risk area than a conventional (Swedish term for small bomb dropped by aircraft), and have the capacity to destroy a large number of heavy armour attacking in mass. A project to develop such a weapon was initiated in cooperation with a weapons manufacturer. The system was called a to clarify the difference between it and an older type cluster weapon. A significant amount of resources was devoted to developing this system, and to make sure that no matter what happened, an UXO would never become active and pose a danger to the civilian populous. Unlike a cluster weapon, every component in this sub-munitions dispenser has been designed so that it cannot leave active, un-exploded sub-munitions. For example, a sub-munition cannot detonate without a correct launch indication. If a faulty sub-munition was to be launched from the pod and by some unlikely event become active on the ground, the internal system has been designed so that the sub-munition cannot detonate for any reason, since it didn't receive a correct launch indication. There are many other design features resulting in that no active un-exploded ordnance is left. The details about exactly how this is achieved are all classified.

Hebrew Bible The turban worn by the High Priest was much larger than the head coverings of the priests and was wound so that it formed a broad, flat- topped turban, resembling the blossom of a flower. The head covering of the priests was different, being wound so that it formed a cone-shaped turban, called a migbahat. It was to be made of fine linen,Exodus 28:39 and like all the holy garments, it was to be made by 'gifted artisans ... filled with the spirit of wisdom'.Exodus 28:3 Rashi writes that the High Priests's turban was identical to the turbans of the other priests.

He came to Newfoundland in 1875 and joined the firm of James Baird in St. John's. He served on St. John's City Council from 1900 to 1904 and was elected to the House of Assembly around the same time.

According to figures released by the General Directorate of Prisons and Detention Houses of the Justice Ministry, there are 100,000 people in Turkish prisons as of November 2008; a doubling since 2000. Agencies General Directorate of Security The police force is responsible for law enforcement in cities and some exceptional locations, such as airports, which they protect with the help of the customs office (). Traffic Police ensure the safety of transportation and also work with registration of vehicles. The Turkish Police also play a big part in important intelligence and counter-terrorist operations. The high command of the Turkish Police, situated in Ankara, is called the General Directorate of Security (). Every district also hosts a District Directorate (). The organization has a centralized hierarchy similar to that of the Turkish Armed Forces. In Turkey, police officers wear navy-blue uniforms and caps. Patrol cars can be identified using the unique blue-white design and the writing \\"Polis\\", usually in capital letters, on the side doors and hood. Lieutenants and captains wear silver stars on their shoulders, while highest-ranking officers wear golden stars. Police officers are required to present their ID before approaching citizens. Some well-known police units in Turkey are: * Yunuslar (Motorcycle Units; yunuslar translates to Dolphins) * √áevik Kuvvet (the Agile Force) who handle difficult cases like demonstrations with the help of K-9 dogs * Panzers, * √ñzel Tim, which is the police tactical unit of the Department. This unit uses special weapons and rapid deployment tactics for exceptional circumstances, such as bank robberies, kidnappings, hostage rescues, etc. Gendarmerie General Command The Gendarmerie (), are military forces of law enforcement. They are trained and supplied by the army but they assume duties under the Minister of Interior. Their organization and duties are quite similar to those of the French Gendarmerie, or Italian Carabinieri. The Gendarmerie Command () is based in Ankara. Their area of jurisdiction is outside city centres, mostly in the country where population and pop. density are low and crime rates are especially high (this is even more true for the Southeastern Anatolia Region, where terrorist acts are committed every day in and out of towns). Most tourist sites are also areas of Jandarma‚Äôs jurisdiction because their average population throughout the year are not high enough to fall under the police departments. The Turkish Gendarmerie engages in counter-terrorist operations in the southeast of Turkey. The Gendarmerie also have an independent organization for Traffic Control () similar to that of the police, but they take shifts outside the cities; similar to the American highway police. In Turkey, Gendarmes can generally be spotted wearing dark green trousers and light green shirts, with special red-and-blue markings on their collars. But any army officer with the same markings no matter which uniform they are in is a Gendarme. Military Police The Askeri ƒ∞nzibat military police is a small force that is under military command that handles cases directly relevant to military security and military crimes. Their area of jurisdiction is generally limited to military bases. But they also track down military criminals (draft dodgers and deserters). Some of the other duties they perform are, protection and VIP detail provided to important bases or commanders, control of traffic inside the bases and providing security in military courts. They can be identified using the very obvious ‚ÄúAS. ƒ∞Z.‚Äù, printed in large letters across the front of their helmets.  Intelligence  The Turkish Intelligence and counter-intelligence operations are conducted by more than one organization also acting with coordination. Firstly, the Police and the Gendarmarie each have a department that perform duties relevant to the collection and analysis of intelligence and countering criminal acts. Police Intelligence Department is the Police force's intelligence wing, second one is Intelligence Department of Gendarmerie General Command. Also, each of the Armed Forces have an intelligence branch within themselves. These are the Naval Intelligence, Army Intelligence and Air Force Intelligence. To supersede all three, the General Staff also has an intelligence branch which ensures the cooperation and coordination of these organizations. As the external intelligence agency, The National Intelligence Organization (, or Mƒ∞T) conducts some part of the intelligence operations. Most of interior intelligence is provided by Police Intelligence Units. The undersecretary of the MIT () reports directly to the Prime Minister.Members of National ƒ∞ntelligence Organization have privilege of freedom from arrest however police and Gendarmarie has not. And the Undersecretariat of Public Order and Security provides coordination between those agencies. Village Guard Village guards () are mostly locals in villages of the Eastern Anatolia Region. They perform auxiliary and voluntary law enforcement duty. Established by a 1985 law, their initial purpose was to defend villages against attacks from the PKK. As a guest police force in Germany In light of growing crime and racial tensions in many Turkish-populated areas of Germany, the German government implemented a plan in 2010 for the Turkish law enforcement to patrol these troubled areas as well as participate in maintaining law and order. The plan was met with criticism, but was implemented in the belief that local law enforcement has difficulty dealing with members of the Turkish community.

These universities are often formed by the regional and international organizations. The distinction between intergovernmental and international university is similar to the one between intergovernmental organization and international organization. International is a rather open- ended term, while intergovernmental specifically refers to the fact that the participating parties or members are sovereign states and intergovernmental organizations. As a result, only intergovernmental universities are subjects of international law. Public international institutions IAU designation The designation ‚Äúinternational university‚Äù (category regional/international in the ‚ÄòList of Universities of the World‚Äô) is applied by the International Association of Universities:http://www.iau- aiu.net/sites/all/files/international.pdf *EUCLIDE (P√¥le Universitaire EUCLIDE) - EUCLID (Euclid University) *European University Institute *South Asian University *IMO International Maritime Law Institute (IMLI) *University of the Arts Helsinki *United Nations University *World Maritime University *Islamic University of Technology (IUT) Other international intergovernmental universities About 10 other public institutions established under international law have been identified as established under international law, for example the University for Peace (Costa Rica), Ecole Sup√©rieure Multinationale des T√©l√©communications (Senegal), and the Eastern and Southern African Management Institute. The University of the West Indies and the University of the South Pacific present interesting cases. Nelson (2011) refers to them as regional universities. He notes that there is no main campus and that several national entities fund and own the institutions. Ali (2012) suggests that these two institutions are not international per se, as they are both creations of the British Crown and not subject to international law. Private international universities Private international universities are institutions that have the expression international university in their name, or international location, of some other reason to be categorized as international in nature. Examples of institutions using the actual name International University are: * International University, Indonesia * International University, Cambodia * Ballsbridge University, Dominica: A private international university * Ross University: A Private international university * Webster University: A private international university * Trinity International University- evangelically-aligned international university affiliated with Evangelical Free Church of America Two well-known international university networks (private) are Alma Mater Europaea of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts, and Laureate International Universities.

The site is near the Gloucestershire village of Badgeworth. The other known population is at Inglestone Common near Wickwar in South Gloucestershire.Guy, C, Haigh, D, Harris, Lucy, Harris, Lyn, Parker, J, Ralphs, I, Tandy, C, (1977 edition edited Holland, S) et al, 1966, 1967, 1977, 2007 editions, 'Badgeworth Nature Reserve Handbook' Gloucestershire Trust for Nature Conservation, Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust The site is a depression on Blue Lias clay, which fills seasonally with rain water and run-off from adjoining pasture to create the wetland habitat which is needed for the plant. History The reserve handbook contains a timeline history. The original reserve dates from 1935 when it was only 290 sq. metres. In 1964 an entry in the Guinness Book of Records described Badgeworth as the world's smallest nature reserve. A further 100 sq. metres was added in 1975. A field of pasture was added in 2002. The seasonal pond is known as Cold Pool which is marshy grassland. The area added in 1975 is known as Warren's Pool. The SSSI designation includes another field of pasture which is not part of the reserve. Adder's-tongue Spearwort has been known at the Badgeworth (Cold Pool) site since 1890. A stock drinking pond was created (now known as Warren's Pool). The site was presented to the Society for the Promotion of Nature Reserves (now the Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts in 1933 and was the first official nature reserve in Gloucestershire. A local management committee was formed and the area was fenced, gated and walkways created over the wet ground. The reserve currently has walkways for people to view the buttercup and there is an annual Open Day event as the reserve is kept locked. The site was given to the Gloucestershire Trust for Nature Conservation (now the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust) in 1962 and was the first reserve to be managed by the Trust in Gloucestershire. It has been owned by the Trust since 1991. Description of Adder's-tongue Spearwort It is a variable, much-branched, over-wintering annual which normally flowers in late May. Its root system consists of long branched fibres which spread in whorls from the lower joints of the stem. The stems and leaves are a pale yellowish- green and the upper sides of the leaves are glossy. The name Adder's-tongue or Snake's-tongue describes the leaves. The flowers are relatively small and have canary-yellow petals. A single plant may have many flowers. These produce a large quantity of seed in a season. Ripe seed was collected in 1991, and sent for storage in the Kew Seed bank. A fuller description is available in the reserve handbook. Species The Gloucestershire Trust for Nature Conservation/Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust handbook includes species information.Kelham, A, Sanderson, J, Doe, J, Edgeley-Smith, M, et al, 1979, 1990, 2002 editions, Nature Reserves of the Gloucestershire Trust for Nature Conservation/Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust The Badgeworth reserve handbook includes a current full species list. Adder's-tongue Spearwort numbers fluctuate from year to year, and depend on the climatic conditions during the autumn germination period. June is the normal flowering period. This wetland site supports a number of other plants, which include Lesser Spearwort, Common Water-crowfoot, Narrow-leaved Water-plantain, Marsh Speedwell, Pink Water- speedwell, Fen Bedstraw and Marsh Foxtail. Since 1963 to 2008, 305 species of beetle have been recorded. Common Frogs and Great Crested, Smooth and Palmate newts breed in the ponds. Conservation Sections of dense growth of Reed Sweet-grass and Creeping Bent are removed in the autumn to create areas of bare soil necessary for germination of Adder's tongue Spearwort. Pollarding of the adjacent willows controls light and the water levels. There is a potential risk of a catastrophic event wiping out this isolated population of Adder's-tongue Spearwort with the gradual encroachment of Cheltenham's boundaries. A new pool has been built to try to establish another colony at the far end of the reserve. A handful of flowers has appeared through natural process.

Arthur Wellington was his English name. \\"Clah\\" is a spelling of one of his hereditary Tsimshian names, ≈Åa'ax. He also held the name T'amks, which carries with it leadership of a matrilineal house-group of the same name in the Gispaxlo'ots, one of the \\"Nine Tribes\\" of Lax Kw'alaams. Clah was born in 1831 at a settlement called \\"Laghco,\\" near where the Hudson's Bay Company established Fort Simpson at Lax Kw'alaams in 1834. He married Catherine (a.k.a. Dorcas) Datacks, of the Laxgibuu (Wolf clan) of the Nisga'a nation. Catherine was niece of the wife of W. H. McNeill, the HBC's chief trader at Fort Simpson. Clah began working as McNeill's house servant but gradually came to be a trader in his own right. Hudson's Bay post at Lax Kw'alaams When the Anglican lay minister William Duncan arrived in Port Simpson in 1857, Clah taught him the Tsimshian language in exchange for instruction in English, a mutual education which began through the medium of Chinook Jargon. Clah also became a mediary between Duncan and the Tsimshian. Clah converted to Christianity but never entirely abandoned potlatching. In a famous incident, Clah intervened and saved Duncan's life when Clah's own tribal chief, Ligeex, ordered Duncan at gunpoint (some versions say knifepoint) to cease tolling churchbells on the day of his (Ligeex's) daughter's initiation into a Tsimshian secret society. Ligeex later became a key convert of Duncan's. This incident is described both by Clah himself and by an eyewitness, his nephew the Rev. William Henry Pierce, the Methodist missionary. For nearly fifty years, from the late 1850s until his death, Clah kept a remarkably detailed diary, which is now housed by the Wellcome Library in London. The diary affords an unmatched insight into daily life in a nineteenth-century Tsimshian community. In 1903 the anthropologist Franz Boas wrote to Clah, having been referred to him by his Tlingit-Kwakwaka'wakw informant and collaborator George Hunt, expressing an interest in recording Tsimshian culture. Eventually, Clah turned the correspondence over to Henry W. Tate‚Äîwho, indications are, was his own son‚Äîwhich led to the first detailed descriptions of Tsimshian culture. In 1915 Clah, near death, served as informant to the anthropologist Marius Barbeau, who was collecting information on Tsimshian social organization. Clah's grandson, William Beynon, served as interpreter and facilitator and went on to become a renowned ethnographic fieldworker in his own right. Clah died in Lax Kw'alaams the following year.

He retired as the most-capped player for the Australian national team with 45 international appearances from 1963 to 1975, and captained his country in 15 Test matches and World Cup games. Langlands was the and goal-kicker for the St. George Dragons in the latter half of their 11-year consecutive premiership-winning run from 1956 to 1966. Background Langlands was born on 2 September 1941 in Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia. Playing career Langlands represented Combined NSW High Schools from 1955 to 1957 and was playing 1st grade with the Wollongong Club in the Illawarra competition at age 18. The got his first big break with selection for Country Firsts in 1962 following the withdrawal of Newcastle's Les Johns due to injury. That same year he made the first of a record 33 interstate matches for New South Wales over 14 seasons. With Billy Smith who also joined St George in 1963, Langlands added new firepower to the aging Dragons champion line up, initially as Reg Gasnier's centre partner, but later moving to fullback. On field Langlands and Smith demonstrated a magical telepathy and an intuitive understanding of each other's kicking and positional game. He made his Test debut as a centre against New Zealand at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 1963. The depth of the selectors' fullback options, including incumbents Ken Thornett then Les Johns, meant that Langlands spent the first four years of his Test career at centre. He excelled there and in the Ashes deciding 2nd Test at Station Road in Swinton against Great Britain on the 1963‚Äì64 Kangaroo Tour he scored an Anglo-Australian record of 20 individual points in the historic 50‚Äì12 \\"Swinton massacre\\". 1963 also saw the Kangaroos win The Ashes in England for the first time as solely an Australian team (the 1911‚Äì12 Kangaroo Tour had included New Zealand players), starting a run from 1963 until the present where Australia hasn't lost a series on a Kangaroo Tour. Thereafter Langlands played international football for Australia every season for 13 seasons. Later in the 1960s, and early 1970s St George got their best value out of Smith and Langlands when all of the stars of the long reign had gone. It was largely due to their combined class that the club remained competitive up till 1975. He was awarded Life Membership of the St. George Dragons in 1973.Dragons- Our Proud History website Langlands played in four St George Grand final winning sides, including 1966 where he kicked seven goals to beat Balmain. He was the competition's leading point scorer in season 1971 and season 1973. He was the Dragon's top point scorer in first grade in 10 seasons between 1963 and 1975. He first captained Australia for the 1970 Ashes series and thereafter barring injury for the next five years. He was Captain- Coach for the 1972 World Cup series, the 1973 Kangaroo tour and the 1974 Test Series at home against Great Britain. In the deciding 3rd game in 1974, Langlands's final and most memorable of his 34 Test appearances, he played a magnificent match to win the Ashes, scoring a try and kicking two goals to take his career tally against Great Britain over the 100-point mark. The Kangaroos thus came from 16‚Äì10 behind at half-time to win the match 22‚Äì18, with Langlands kicking the goal which gave his side their winning lead. After the game he was carried aloft from the field by his team-mates with the 55,505 strong SCG crowd chanting \\"Changa, Changa\\". Since the 1974 series, Australia has not yet lost The Ashes to either Great Britain or England. Langlands last captained Australia in their undefeated four match campaign of the 1975 World Cup. He was the last Kangaroo selected in the dual Captain-Coach role. He also retired with the record of Australia's top point-scorer against Great Britain until surpassed by Mal Meninga in 1992. Greatest try never scored During the final of the 1972 World Cup played between Australia and Great Britain at the Stade de Gerland in Lyon, France, Langlands was involved in what many believe to be the \\"greatest try never scored\\". During the first half of the game (which ended in a 10-all draw and gave the Lions the World Cup based on previous results of the tournament), Australian halfback Dennis Ward put up a bomb about 45 metres from the Lions try line. Langlands gave chase and as the ball came down over the try line, he leaped into the air and caught it on the full and had seemingly scored a spectacular try. The French referee Georges Jameau disallowed it though, believing Langlands to be offside. Television replays however showed the Australian Captain-coach was approximately half a metre onside and that he had scored a fair try. The man and his playing style Langlands had an unhappy childhood brought up by an alcoholic father. On-field he could be hot-headed and petulant in his early career, though he matured into a fine leader. Fundamentally taciturn and introspective he was not given to pre- or post-match speeches as captain but demonstrated an uncompromising leadership style via his will-to-win and a preparedness to be mean and ruthless if required. He was a graceful, balanced runner of the ball, long-striding and fast. His trademark sidestep off either foot has become legendary in the Australian game. He would almost undetectably feint one way then make a 2m leap the other way at full speed taking him diagonally through a gap and into the clear. \\"The white boots affair\\" An incident renowned in Australian rugby league concerns Langlands playing for the Dragons in the 1975 NSWRL Grand Final against Jack Gibson's coached Eastern Suburbs. Before the game, Langlands, who was pulling up poorly from a long-standing groin injury, was given a painkilling injection that, rather than deadening his pain, instead made his whole leg numb. Langlands wrote in his book Larrikin and Saint: \\"It was an injection that went wrong. It wasn't the doctor's fault. The injection went in where the nerves shouldn't have been. They had moved because of all the injuries that I've had around the groin\\".Heads;Middleton, (2008) When Langlands kicked for the touchline early in the match but missed, it became obvious to everyone that something was wrong. The Dragons' match plan was to keep the Roosters pinned back in their own half with long kicks (a tactic that Canterbury used ten years later). With their main kicker useless, the Dragons found themselves unable to stop the Roosters advancing. After a heated argument with Dragons club secretary-treasurer Frank Facer in the dressing rooms at half time, Langlands made his way back onto the field after half-time, but made little difference as the Roosters ran in seven tries to win 38‚Äì0. Making matters worse were his white football boots, worn as part of a sponsorship deal with Adidas. At the time, black football boots were the norm and Langlands's white boots were unique on the field, highlighting every mistake he made to the fans. Langlands later admitted regret at not listening to Facer and returning to the field for the second half. He was originally planning to retire at the end of the Grand Final, but the humiliating experience spurred him to return in 1976, where in the few early-season matches he played his performance was mediocre. After retirement He retired in 1976 at age 34 after 235 matches (all grades) for St George. Though regarded as having played one season too many, he finished his career as one of the most respected men to ever play the game. In his retirement year he was awarded a Member of the Order of the British Empire, (MBE) medal for his contribution to Rugby League and club life. In 1985 Rugby League Week nominated an Australian 'Masters' side picking its 13 best players since 1970. Amongst them were eight Australian former captains. Dressing in their Australian strip for a commemorative photo at the Sydney Cricket Ground Langlands was late to take his seat. He arrived to find one spot left ‚Äì front row, centre seat. These legendary players had spontaneously selected him as their Captain, showing the respect he had earned from his peers during his career. Langlands was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1986. In 1999 Langlands, and Queensland State of Origin legend Wally Lewis became the fifth & sixth selected post-war \\"Immortals\\" respectively of the Australian Rugby League, joining original Immortals Clive Churchill, Johnny Raper, Reg Gasnier and Bob Fulton who had been chosen in 1981 by noted publication Rugby League Week. In 2002 Langlands was inducted into the Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame. In February 2008, Langlands was named in the list of Australia's 100 Greatest Players (1908‚Äì2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia. Langlands went on to be named as an interchange player in Australian rugby league's Team of the Century. Announced on 17 April 2008, the team is the panel's majority choice for each of the thirteen starting positions and four interchange players. In 2008 New South Wales announced their rugby league team of the century also, naming Langlands at centre. In November 2017 it was announced that Langlands had been charged with historic sex offences allegedly occurring in Molendinar in 1982. The charges were dropped after Langlands's death in January 2018. Death Langlands died on 20 January 2018 at a nursing facility in Sydney's Sutherland Shire at the age of 76. He was being treated for dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

At the centre of the Wall are statues to William Farel, John Calvin, Theodore Beza, and John Knox. The Christogram can be seen below the statues. The International Monument to the Reformation, aerial view The International Monument to the Reformation (French: Monument international de la R√©formation, German: Internationales Reformationsdenkmal), usually known as the Reformation WallIt is sometimes translated into other forms, including 'Wall of the Reformation' and 'Wall of the Reformers'. (French: Mur des r√©formateurs), is a monument in Geneva, Switzerland. It honours many of the main individuals, events, and documents of the Protestant Reformation by depicting them in statues and bas-reliefs. The Wall is in the grounds of the University of Geneva, which was founded by John Calvin, and was built to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Calvin's birth and the 350th anniversary of the university's establishment. It is built into the old city walls of Geneva, and the monument's location there is designed to represent the fortifications', and therefore the city of Geneva's, integral importance to the Reformation. Inaugurated in 1909, it was the culmination of a contest launched to transform that part of the park. The contest involved 71 proposals from around the world, but was won by four Swiss architects: Charles Dubois, Alphonse Laverri√®re, Eug√®ne Monod, and Jean Taillens (whose other design came third). The sculptures were then created by two French sculptors: Paul Landowski and Henri Bouchard.Chancellerie de l'Etat de Gen√®ve: Le parc des Bastions.

During the Reformation, Geneva was the centre of Calvinism, and its history and heritage since the sixteenth century has been closely linked to that of Protestantism. Due to the close connections to that theology, the individuals most prominently depicted on the Wall were Calvinists; nonetheless, key figures in other theologies are also included. At the centre of the monument, four 5 m-tall statues of Calvinism's main proponents are depicted: * William Farel (1489‚Äì1565) * John Calvin (1509‚Äì1564) * Theodore Beza (1519‚Äì1605) * John Knox (c.1513‚Äì1572) To the left (facing the Wall, ordered from left to right) of the central statues are 3 m-tall statues of: * Frederick William of Brandenburg (1620‚Äì1688) * William the Silent (1533‚Äì1584) * Gaspard de Coligny (1519‚Äì1572) To the right (ordered from left to right) are 3 m-tall statues of: * Roger Williams (1603‚Äì1684) * Oliver Cromwell (1599‚Äì1658) * Stephen Bocskai (1557‚Äì1606) Along the wall, to either side of the central statues, is engraved the motto of both the Reformation and Geneva: Post Tenebras Lux (Latin for After darkness, light). On the central statues' pedestal is engraved a Christogram: ŒôŒóŒ£. The monument gave inspiration to one of the most important 20th century Hungarian poems, written by Gyula Illy√©s in 1946 under the title Before the Monument of Reformation in Geneva.

By 1989, Tribal Tech had been signed to Relativity Records, and Nomad was planned for release that summer. However, the album was not officially released until early 1990.

Originally established as \\"Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary\\" in Chattanooga, Tennessee in 1948, the name was changed to Temple Baptist Theological Seminary five years later, after the Southern Baptist Convention founded its own Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary. The seminary became a part of Piedmont when its parent school, Tennessee Temple University, merged with it in 2015. Temple Baptist Seminary was accredited in 2000 as part of Tennessee Temple University's Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools (TRACS) accreditation. Prior to that it was accredited by the American Association of Bible Colleges (now known as ABHE). Both ABHE and TRACS are accreditors recognized by the US Department of Education and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. History On July 3, 1946, Highland Park Baptist Church, under the leadership of the pastor, Dr. Lee Roberson, voted to establish Tennessee Temple College (now University). Then, recognizing the lack of sound Biblical training in the majority of the seminaries, Dr. Roberson led the church in establishing Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary on January 26, 1948. Dr. Roberson served as president, and Dr. Alfred Cierpke as dean. Five years later, the name was changed to Temple Baptist Theological Seminary since the Southern Baptist Convention founded a seminary by the former name. Since 1985, the institution has been known as Temple Baptist Seminary. In 1962, Dr. Douglas Cravens assumed the position of dean. With the assumption of the presidency of the university and seminary by Dr. J. Don Jennings in 1985, Dr. Roger Martin was named dean. In June 1993, the university and the seminary were restructured, placing each under the supervision of a separate Board of Trustees and administrative leadership, while maintaining the identity of each as owned by and a ministry of Highland Park Baptist Church. With respect to the seminary, Dr. Lee Roberson was reappointed chancellor, Dr. David E. Bouler, who had been the senior pastor of Highland Park Baptist Church since August 4, 1991, was named vice-chancellor and Dr. Barkev S. Trachian was elected president. The seminary charter was amended in August 1993, to make the name Temple Baptist Seminary official. April 2005 saw the university and seminary restructured a second time, reuniting the two under the supervision of a single Board of Trustees and the administration of Dr. J. Danny Lovett, the seventh president of Tennessee Temple University, with Temple Baptist Seminary re-establishing itself as the premier graduate division as originally envisioned by the founder, Dr. Lee Roberson. This restructure was confirmed in late November 2005 by the university's and seminary's accrediting agency. Fixed firmly to its foundations, Temple Baptist Seminary is committed to training qualified candidates for dynamic leadership in Bible-believing churches and related field ministries, to shaping His shepherds, and to developing disciples with the unchanging Word of God on a global scale. From the outset, the seminary has been committed to upholding the biblical faith historically believed by Baptists. In addition there has been a strong emphasis upon Bible teaching, Christian education, evangelism, and ministry endeavor. With the theme \\"Preparing for Leadership,\\" TBS continues to expand its efforts to equip both church leaders and laypersons for the work of the ministry. In recent years, a program of winter and summer modular classes has been initiated. This program has become very popular with both resident and out-of-town students. Nearly all Temple Baptist Seminary's courses are available on-line, enabling studies anywhere worldwide! Temple Baptist Seminary has matriculated students from almost every state and from many foreign countries. Many graduates have distinguished themselves as pastors, military and civilian chaplains, teachers, educators, missionaries, and evangelists. As of January 2012, Dr. Steve Echols assumed the leadership role as president of Tennessee Temple University. He brings a vast array of experience and proven leadership in both academic and ministerial areas.http://www.tntemple.edu/history-of-temple In 2012, TTU realigned its academic programs into three colleges of schools. The Seminary became a part of the School of Theology and Ministry. Also in September 2012, Highland Park Baptist Church announced its visions to relocate to Harrison, TN and change its name to Church of the Highlands. During this transition, changes to the TTU by-laws were unanimously ratified by both the Board of Trustees of TTU and the deacon body of the Church of the Highlands. These by-law changes have ended the formal relationship between the two entities. Yet the heritage of Highland Park Baptist Church will remain an essential part of the lasting legacy of TTU. At the 2013 Tennessee Baptist Convention Annual Meeting, TTU had a booth for the first time in the history of our school. It was a wonderful success resulting in many important contacts and connections being made with Tennessee Baptists. \\"Even more importantly\\", TTU President Dr. Steve Echols stated, \\"I am rejoicing over a historic moment for Tennessee Temple University.\\" During the session, the Tennessee Baptist Convention Messengers unanimously adopted a resolution of support which \\"affirms the actions of Tennessee Temple University (in Chattanooga) in embracing Southern Baptist doctrine and Tennessee Baptist life.\\" http://www.tnbaptist.org/pdf/resolutions2013/TennesseeTempleUniversityResolution.pdf In 2013, Dr. Howard D.

A famous likely speaker was Emperor Charlemagne. Linguists have different views about whether these languages and dialects have descended from a single Franconian proto-language, also known as Istvaeonic. The Franconian languages and dialects consist of three main groups. The first is the Low Franconian branch, which consists of Dutch and Afrikaans as well as of several Low Franconian dialects spoken in the Netherlands and Belgium, where they are considered as dialects of Dutch and Limburgish, and in Germany, where they are considered as dialects of German. The second group are the Central- and Rhine Franconian dialects. These Central German dialects are considered as dialects of German in Germany and Belgium, as Luxembourgish in Luxembourg, as Lorraine Franconian in France, and as Kerkraads in the Netherlands. Pennsylvania German has an almost purely Rhine Franconian dialect basis. The southernmost group of Franconian dialects are the High Franconian dialects, consisting of the South- and East Franconian dialects. South Franconian is mainly spoken in Germany, but extends into Northeastern Alsace in France, whereas East Franconian is only spoken in Germany. The High Franconian dialects are considered as dialects of German in Germany, and as Alsatian in France. They are transitional dialects between Central- and Upper German. Because they are spoken in the region of Franconia, the East Franconian dialects are the only ones colloquially referred to as \\"Franconian\\" (or, rather, Fr√§nkisch) by their speakers. Three groups Low Franconian Low Franconian dialect area in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and France. Low Franconian, also called Low Frankish, consists of Dutch, Afrikaans, Limburgish, and their dialects, some of which are sometimes seen as regional languages. They are spoken in the Netherlands, Belgium, South Africa, Namibia, the western tip of Germany (in the West German Lower Rhine region, former Duchy of Cleves), the northern tip of France (Westhoek), Suriname, and parts of the Caribbean, as well as in communities in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. With a total of over 40The total of speakers of all Low Franconian dialects and languages, based on Ethnologue gives a number of over 40 million speakers: 22 million Dutch speakers, 16 million Afrikaans speakers and the various dialects of these 2 languages (Flemish for example, has one million speakers) creates a number around, and probably over 40 million speakers. million speakers this is the most numerous of the three groups, as well as most spread globally and the only group that has members which are official, national and standard languages. Sometimes, Low Franconian is grouped together with Low German rather confusingly as \\"Low German\\". However, since this grouping is not based on common linguistic innovations, but rather on the absence of the High German consonant shift and Anglo-Frisian features, modern scholars prefer not to group them together.Gl√ºck, H. (ed.): Metzler Lexikon Sprache, pages 472, 473. Stuttgart, Weimar: Metzler, 2000 (entries Niederdeutsch and Niederfr√§nkisch) A transitional zone between Low Franconian and Central Franconian is formed by the so-called Meuse-Rhenish dialects (e.g. Low Dietsch, Bergish, and East Bergish) located in southern Dutch Limburg and in the German Lower Rhine (German: Niederrhein).Welschen, Ad : Course Dutch Society and Culture, International School for Humanities and Social Studies ISHSS, Universiteit van Amsterdam 2000-2005.

It is estimated that these dialects have about 17,000,000 native speakersWhen taking all West Central German dialects as listed by Ethnologue the number 15.350,000 appears, 2 dialects have no speaker data, however considering the area in which they are spoken and the demographics of the area as well as comparable dialects an estimate of about 4,000,000 can be made. * Central Franconian dialects ** Ripuarian, spoken in northern Rhineland, including the Colognian language (K√∂lsch) ** Moselle Franconian, spoken in the southern Rhineland, including Luxembourgish and the Transylvanian Saxon dialect * Rhine Franconian dialects ** Palatine German, including Pennsylvania German (more commonly known as Pennsylvania Dutch) ** Hessian, spoken in the state of Hesse and in the adjacent Rhenish Hesse region of Rhineland-Palatinate * Lorraine Franconian, collective term for Central and Rhine Franconian dialects spoken in France High Franconian The Franconian dialects of Vogtland, the easternmost Franconian-speaking region. Franconian Vogtland (Bavaria):Saxon Vogtland: The High Franconian dialects consist of the East- and South Franconian dialects. These dialects are transitional dialects between Central- and Upper German, and are spoken by an estimated 2,500,000 people. =East Franconian= The East Franconian dialect branch is one of the most spoken dialect branches in Germany. These dialects are mainly spoken in the region of Franconia. Franconia consists of the Bavarian districts of Upper-, Middle-, and Lower Franconia, the region of South Thuringia (Thuringia), and the eastern parts of the region of Heilbronn- Franken (Tauber Franconia and Hohenlohe) in Baden-W√ºrttemberg. The easternmost Franconian-speaking areas are the Saxon parts of Vogtland, in whose central parts East Franconian (Core Vogtlandian), and in whose eastern parts transitional dialects (North Vogtlandian and Southeast Vogtlandian) are spoken. The East Franconian dialects are the only Franconian dialects that are referred to as \\"Franconian\\" by their speakers. Only the speakers in Saxon Vogtland refer to their dialects as \\"Vogtlandian\\" rather than \\"Franconian\\". The largest cities in the East Franconian dialect area are Nuremberg and W√ºrzburg. =South Franconian= South Franconian is mainly spoken in northern Baden-W√ºrttemberg in Germany, but also in the northeasternmost part of the region of Alsace in France. While these dialects are considered as dialects of German in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, they are considered as dialects of Alsatian in Alsace (the other Alsatian dialects are either Alemannic or Rhine Franconian). The South Franconian dialects are colloquially referred to by their speakers as \\"Badian\\" in the Badian parts, and as \\"Unterl√§ndisch\\" (the Unterland being the region around Heilbronn) or \\"Swabian\\" (because of strong influences from the capital Stuttgart, where Swabian dialects are spoken) in the W√ºrttembergian parts of Baden-W√ºrttemberg. The largest cities in the South Franconian dialect area are Karlsruhe and Heilbronn. Meaning of \\"Franconian\\" As it applies to modern languages, Franconian is somewhat variable in meaning. It can refer to a West Germanic dialect continuum spoken in the Rhineland, including Dutch at one end and all the transitional dialects between Dutch and standard German, including it, which do not fully participate in the High German consonant shift or German diphthongization of long vowels. This area follows the course of the Benrath and Speyer lines, a zone along which the two changes occurred along with other diagnostic changes. From a linguistics point of view the Rhineland is an intermediate zone where the Rhenish Fan is located, a zone where eight isoglosses converge. Not all Dutch dialects are contained in the Rhineland; moreover, historical Franconian, which comprises other aspects of the language of the Franks, was spoken also in the lowlands. Dutch is spoken between the Rhineland and the North Sea. A second definition extends the range of Franconian to include the lowlands to the west, to the east all the way to Bamberg in East Franconia, and to the south as far as, and including, Alsace, far from the Rhineland. In all, in this definition, the Franconian language area consists of the Low Countries (Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg), parts of France (e.g. the Dunkirk district and half of Lorraine), and West-Central Germany (around Aachen, Cologne and Trier), as well as all of the former Franconia. In addition to these continental dialects, Franconian includes two overseas dialects: Afrikaans spoken in South Africa and the Pennsylvania German language spoken in North America. The difference between a dialect and a language is often debatable. In general, a dialect is contained within a language, and is not identical to it, unless the language has only that dialect. The Franconian languages are considered dialects of German and Dutch even though often termed languages. The dialects are further subdivided into ranges under a common name, which may also be subdivided; for example, Flemish is a dialect of Dutch. It is further divided into East and West Flemish. Not all dialects of Dutch and German are Franconian. For example, in the case of German, excluded from the category \\"Franconian\\" are the high, or \\"Alpine,\\" dialects of Swabia, Bavaria, Austria and Switzerland, as well as the various dialects of Low German. The word \\"Franconian\\" refers to a collection of dialects, and not to a language. Languages have to be genetically related, unless they are defined as isolates; that is, a parent language descends into child languages, or reflex languages, which are defined on that account to be \\"related.\\" Dialects are not necessarily related. For example, German and Dutch, which are closely related, descend from Proto-Germanic, a parent language. Dialects of German and Dutch at any stage of their development are not necessarily related to each other. The defining elements of the dialect might come from any language or be innovated. No dialect labelled \\"Franconian\\" has to be related to any other dialect of the same tag. For example, Old Low Franconian, ancestral phase of Dutch, is not related to the Franconian dialects of Old High German. Moreover, Middle Franconian is not related to Middle High German. Historical views of the linguistic concept and meaning of \\"Franconian\\" \\"Franconian\\" is an English word. Continental Europeans use the equivalent of \\"Frankish\\", from the original Latin Franci, with the same meaning; for example, the German for Old Franconian is alt-Fr√§nkisch. The Dutch linguist, Jan van Vliet (1622-1666), uses Francica or Francks to mean the language of the oude Francken (\\"Old Franks\\"). According to van Vliet, Francks descended from oud Teuts, what is today referred to in English as the Proto-Germanic language.. Old Franconian German stem duchy of Franconia, about 1000 The name \\"Franconian\\", an English adjective made into a noun, comes from the official Latin name of an area (and later stem duchy) in the Middle Ages known as Franconia (German: Franken). If being in the territory of the original Franci is a criterion of being Frankish, it was not originally Frankish, but Alemannic, as the large Roman base at Mainz, near the confluence of the Main and the Rhine, kept the Franci and the Suebi, core tribe of the Alemanni, apart. When the Romans withdrew, the fort became a major base of the Ripuarian Franks, who promptly moved up the Main, founded Frankfurt (\\"the ford of the Franks\\"), established a government over the Suebi between the Rhine and the Danube, and proceeded to assimilate them to all things Frankish, including the dialects. The Ripuarian Franks at that time were not acting as such, but were simply part of the Frankish empire under the Carolingian dynasty. Franconian is the only English single word describing the region called Franken by the Germans. The population considered as native is also called Franken, who speak a language called Fr√§nkisch, which are dialects included in German. In the Middle Ages, before German prevailed officially over Latin, the Latinizations, Franconia and Francones, were used in official documents. Since Latin was the scholarly lingua franca, the Latin forms spread to Britain as well as to other nations. English speakers had no reason to convert to Franken; moreover, \\"Frankish\\" was already being used for French and Dutch. Franconian was kept. The English did not have much to say about Franconian until the 18th century, except that it was \\"High Dutch,\\" and \\"German.\\" In 1767 Thomas Salmon published: \\"Province\\", as it was applied to Germany, meant one of the ten Reichskreise of the Holy Roman Empire. Slingsby Bethel had published a description of them in a political treatise of 1681, referring to each of them as a \\"province,\\" and describing, among them, \\"The Franconian Circle.\\" Slingsby's language development goes no further than \\"High Germany,\\" where \\"High Dutch\\" was spoken and \\"the lower parts of Germany,\\" speaking, presumably, Low Dutch. Salmon's implicit identification of dialects with Reichskreise speech is the very misconception found objectionable by Green and Siegmund: In the mid-19th century, a time when the Germans were attempting to define a standard German, the term alt-Fr√§nkisch made its appearance, which was an adjective meaning \\"old-fashioned.\\" It came into English immediately as \\"Old Franconian.\\" English writings mentioned Old Franconian towns, songs and people, among other things. To the linguists, the term was a windfall, as it enabled them to distinguish a Stammsprach. For example, in 1863 Gustave Solling's Diutiska identified the Pledge of Charles the Bald, which is in Old High German, as Old Franconian. He further explains that the latter is an Upper German dialect. By the end of the century the linguists understood that between \\"Low Dutch\\" and \\"High Dutch\\" was a partially altered continuum, which they called Middle, or Central, German. It had been grouped with Upper, or High, German. This \\"Middle\\" was between low and high, as opposed to the Chronological Middle High German, between old and new. In 1890 Ernest Adams defined Old Franconian as an Old High German dialect spoken on the middle and upper Rhine; i.e., it went beyond the limits of Franconia to comprise also the dialect continuum of the Rhineland. His earlier editions, such as the 1858, did not feature any Old Franconian. Old Low Franconian After the English concept of Franconian had expanded to encompass the Rhineland in the 1850s and 1860s, a paradox seemed to prevent it from spreading to the lower Rhine. Language there could not be defined as High German in any way. In 1862 Max M√ºller pointed out that Jacob Grimm had applied the concept of \\"German\\" grammar to ten languages, which \\"all appear to have once been one and the same.\\" In this review Vaughan and Allon are paraphrasing from Max M√ºller's Science of Language lecture series, German language, later translated and published in English. One of these was the \\"Netherland Language, which appears to have been produced by the combined action of the older Franconian and Saxon, and stands therefore in close relation to the Low German and the Friesian. Its descendants now are the Flemish in Belgium and Dutch in Holland [sic].\\" M√ºller, after describing Grimm's innovation of the old, middle and new phases of High German, contradicts himself by reiterating that Franconian was a dialect of the upper Rhine. After somewhat over a generation a formal solution had been universally accepted: Franconian had a low phase. An 1886 work by Strong and Meyer defined Low Franconian as the language \\"spoken on the lower Rhine.\\" Their presentation included an Upper, Middle and Lower Franconian, essentially the modern scheme. Low Franconian, however, introduced another conflict of concepts, as Low Franconian must mean, at least in part, Dutch. Here Strong and Meyer are anachronistic on behalf of consistency, an error that would not have been made by native Dutch or German speakers. According to them, \\"Franconian ceases to be applied to this language; it is then called Netherlandish (Dutch)....\\" Only the English ever applied Franconian anywhere; moreover, Netherlandish had been in use since the 17th century, after which Dutch was an entirely English word. The error had been corrected by the time of Wright's An Old High-German Primer two years later, in 1888. Wright identifies Old Low Franconian with Old Dutch, both terms used only in English. Old Frankish Before it acquired the present name \\"Germanic\\", \\"Germanic\\" was known as \\"Teutonic\\". The Germanics were literary witnesses in history to the alteration of their early Germanic speech into multiple languages. The early speech then became Old Teutonic. However, this Old Teutonic remained out of view, prior to the earliest writings, except for the language of the runic inscriptions, which, being one or two words and numbering less than a thousand, are an insufficient sample to verify any but a few phonetic details of the reconstructed proto-language. Van Vliet and his 17th century contemporaries inherited the name and the concept \\"Teutonic\\". Teutones and Teutoni are names from classical Latin referring to the entire population of Germanics in the Proto-Germanic era, although there were tribes specifically called Teutons. Between \\"Old Dutch\\" (meaning the earliest Dutch language) and \\"Old Teutonic\\", Van Vliet inserted \\"Frankish\\", the language of the Old Franks. He was unintentionally ambiguous about who these \\"Old Franks\\" were linguistically. At one point in his writing they were referred to as \\"Old High German\\" speakers, at another, \\"Old Dutch\\" speakers, and at another \\"Old French\\" speakers. Moreover, he hypothesized at one point that Frankish was a reflection of Gothic. The language of the literary fragments available to him was not clearly identified. Van Vliet was searching for a group he thought of as the \\"Old Franks\\", which to him included everyone from Mainz to the mouth of the Rhine. By the end of the 17th century the concept of Old Frankish, the ancestor language of Dutch, German, and the Frankish words in Old French had been firmly established. After the death of Junius, a contemporary of Van Vliet, Johann Georg Graevius said of him in 1694 that he collected fragments of vetere Francica, \\"Old Frankish,\\" ad illustrandam linguam patriam, \\"for the elucidation of the mother tongue.\\" The concept of the Dutch vetere Francica, a language spoken by the Franks mentioned in Gregory of Tours and of the Carolingian Dynasty, which at one end of its spectrum became Old Dutch, and at the other, Old High German, threw a shadow into neighboring England, even though the word \\"Franconian\\", covering the same material, was already firmly in use there. The term \\"Old Frankish\\" in English is vague and analogous, referring either to language or to other aspects of culture. In the most general sense, \\"old\\" means \\"not the present\\", and \\"Frankish\\" means anything claimed to be related to the Franks from any time period. The term \\"Old Frankish\\" has been used of manners, architecture, style, custom, government, writing and other aspects of culture, with little consistency. In a recent history of the Germanic people, Ozment used it to mean the Carolingian and all preceding governments and states calling themselves Franks through the death of the last admittedly Frankish king, Conrad I of Germany, in 919, and his replacement by a Saxon. This \\"Old Frankish\\" period, then, beginning in the Proto-Germanic period and lasting until the 10th century, is meant to include Old High German, Old Dutch and the language that split to form Low German and High German. Proto-Frankish Germanic is so diverse as to defy attempts to arrive at a uniform Germanic ancestor. Max M√ºller finally wrote in the lectures on the Science of Language, under the heading, \\"No Proto-Teutonic Language:\\" > \\"We must not suppose that before that time [7th century] there was one > common Teutonic language spoken by all Germanic tribes and that it > afterwards diverged into two streams ‚Äî the High and the Low. There never was > a common, uniform Teutonic language; .... This is a mere creation of > grammarians who cannot understand a multiplicity of dialects without a > common type.\\" Historical linguistics did not validate his rejection of the Tree model, but it did apply the Wave model to explain the diversity. Features can cross language borders in a wave to impart characteristics not explicable by descent from the language's ancestor. The linguists of the early 19th century, including M√ºller, had already foreshadowed the Wave Model with a concept of the \\"blend\\" of languages, of which they made such frequent use in the case of Germanic that it was difficult to discern any unblended language. These hypothetical \\"pure\\" languages were about as inaccessible as the Proto-Germanic Old Frankish; that is, pure guesswork. Dialects or languages in the sense of dialects became the major feature of the Germanic linguistic landscape. Old Dutch A second term in use by Van Vliet was oud Duijts, \\"Old Dutch\\", where Duijts meant \\"the entire Continental Germanic continuum\\". The terms Nederlandsch and Nederduijts were coming into use for contemporary Dutch. Van Vliet used the oud Duijts ambiguously to mean sometimes Francks, sometimes Old Dutch, and sometimes Middle Dutch, perhaps because the terms were not yet firm in his mind.. Duijts had been in general use until about 1580 to refer to the Dutch language, but subsequently was replaced by Nederduytsch. English linguists lost no time in bringing Van Vliet's oud Duijts into English as \\"Old Dutch\\". The linguistic noun \\"Old Dutch\\", however, competed with the adjective \\"Old Dutch\\", meaning an earlier writing in the same Dutch, such as an old Dutch rhyme, or an old Dutch proverb. For example, Brandt's \\"old Dutch proverb\\", in the English of his translator, John Childe, mentioned in 1721: Eendracht maekt macht, en twist verquist, \\"Unity gives strength, and Discord wastes,\\" means contemporary Dutch and not Old Dutch. On the frontispiece, Childe refers to the language in which the book was written as \\"the original Low Dutch\\". Linguistic \\"Old Dutch\\" had already become \\"Low Dutch\\", the contemporary language, and \\"High Dutch\\", or High German. On the other hand, \\"Old Dutch\\" was a popular English adjective used in the 18th century with reference to people, places and things.

From 1982 to 1992, he was a columnist for Guitar Player magazine. Those ten years of columns became a book, Hot Guitar. Music career Roth attended the High School of Music and Art in New York City from 1966 to 1969 as an art student. He then studied at the Philadelphia College of Art from 1969 to 1971. His band Steel lived with him and would play in Woodstock, New York, on weekends, where he was discovered. In 1970, Steel put on the first Woodstock Reunion concert to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the festival in Bethel, New York, where Roth lived every summer since he was born. Steel was the only band and played four hours each day. Soon after, he moved to Woodstock, New York, and began his career as a professional guitarist. He began to back-up in recording and touring with Happy and Artie Traum, Eric Andersen, Tony Bird, Paul Butterfield, Art Garfunkel, John Herald, Janis Ian, Janey & Dennis, Looking Glass, Don McLean, John Prine, Helen Schneider, Pete Seeger, Phoebe Snow, Dusty Springfield, Loudon Wainwright III. He toured with the Bee Gees in 1974, Simon and Garfunkel in 1983, and Duane Eddy with Huey Lewis and the News. In 1976, he appeared in the Bob Dylan film Renaldo and Clara performing with Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Patti Smith and Phil Ochs. He is featured performing on his 1953 Telecaster with Patti Smith in the 2019 Bob Dylan / Martin Scorsese film \\"Rolling Thunder.\\" From the 1975 tour of the same name. Bob Dylan borrowed Roth's Martin 000-18 guitar that night, which Arlen bought from Ry Cooder earlier that year when Arlen was on tour with John Prine. His first book, Slide Guitar, was published by Oak Publications when he was 21. In 2012, Thank You Les, a Les Paul Tribute album and documentary were released with Roth performing \\"Mr. Sandman\\" and his daughter Lexie Roth singing the Les Paul and Mary Ford song \\"Vaya Con Dios\\". He released a Slide Guitar Summit album in 2015 featuring duets with guitarists Cindy Cashdollar, Sonny Landreth, David Lindley, Greg Martin, Lee Roy Parnell, Jack Pearson, Rick Vito, Jimmy Vivino, and Johnny Winter. This is said to be Johnny Winter's final recording. Roth is a Telecaster enthusiast who wrote the book Masters of the Telecaster detailing the techniques of many famous Telecaster guitarists.Masters of the Telecaster book description at JK Lutherie's website, (Accessed 12 August 2006) He has performed and recorded with the Bee Gees, Rory Block, Cindy Cashdollar, Ry Cooder, Bob Dylan, Duane Eddy, Ramblin' Jack Elliot, John Entwistle, Art Garfunkel, Danny Gatton, Vince Gill, Levon Helm, Bill Kirchen, Sonny Landreth, Albert Lee, David Lindley, Don McLean, Steve Morse, Phil Ochs, Brad Paisley, John Prine, John Sebastian, Simon and Garfunkel, Paul Simon, Phoebe Snow, James Taylor, Kate Taylor, Livingston Taylor, Rick Wakeman, Joe Louis Walker, and Steve Wariner.Endorsing Artists: Arlen Roth at the Dean Markley Strings website, (Accessed 12 August 2006) In 1998, Roth lost his wife Deborah, and their first child Gillian in a fatal car accident on the Merritt Parkway in Connecticut. Gillian was 14 years old, and Deborah was 47. Gillian was an actress, a model and was a guitarist like her father. She had just signed on to do a 27 episode TV show for Nickelodeon called the \\"Gunks\\" which was a show about an all-girl rock band, loosely based on \\"The Monkees.\\" Video instruction In 1979 Roth and his wife Deborah started the Hot Licks Audio and Video label. With only $2000 left to their names, Roth decided that he was going to act on the idea he got back in 1973 to create taped musical instruction based on how he always encouraged his students to tape their private lessons. His very first advertisement featured 42 cassette lessons in all, stretched over 7 series of 6 tapes apiece. The tapes very quickly became very successful worldwide and many of his students were also very experienced professionals. While teaching Ralph Macchio the guitar parts for the movie Crossroads, he began recording his first videos (in 1984). Six of these featured Roth as instructor and one was by his friend John Entwistle, bass player of The Who. The close-ups of fretting, strumming, and other techniques he helped develop, and which were prominent in Crossroads, became the trademark of the videos. The Hot Licks catalog grew to also include instructional videos for drums, banjo, lap steel, mandolin, voice and harmonica, with 150 artists and 180 videos. Roth has been recognized as the first to create video music instruction. In 2006 The Music Sales Group acquired the Hot Licks video catalog. From 2007 to 2012 Roth hosted a series of daily video lessons at Gibson.com.Gibson Guitar Lessons (Accessed 17 September 2008) It is estimated he has close to 1 million students on Gibson. He also wrote daily blogs for Gibson Guitar. Arlen has also been known as the \\"Master of the Telecaster\\". Roth has stated that \\"many of these Hot Licks artists were also personal heroes of mine, and it was an honor to work with them\\".

Early life  Anna was born Catherine Maria Anna Mercer Parnell at Avondale House in Rathdrum, County Wicklow, Ireland. The tenth of eleven children of John Henry Parnell, a landlord and Delia Tudor Stewart Parnell, an Irish-American and the daughter of Admiral Charles Stewart (1778‚Äì1869) of the US Navy. She had very little formal education as a child but the family had an extensive library which she was encouraged to read by her mother. After her father died in 1859 Anna moved with the family to Dublin. Delia Parnell was an active socialite while in Dublin and exposed her children to a wide variety of political views. Anna wrote poetry and painted. In 1865 the family moved to Paris but Anna felt stifled by upper class society rules imposed upon her. She was in Paris when the Franco-Prussian War broke out in 1870 and was active in the American Ladies' Committee fundraising and setting up hospitals.  Early political activism  Anna moved to London in 1875 to continue studying art. When her brother Charles was elected as an MP for Meath, Anna became increasingly political. She frequently visited Parliament during debates, sitting in the Ladies' Gallery. She wrote articles about the debates in a column titled Notes From the Ladies' Cage in the Celtic Monthly. In 1879 Anna joined her sister, Fanny Parnell (1848‚Äì1882), a poet, in New York where they raised money in support of the Irish National Land League. The sisters worked closely with their brother Charles and Michael Davitt but were critical of how the funds raised in America were being used in Ireland. In October 1880 the sisters founded the New York Ladies' Land League with their mother as president. Ladies' Land League Anna returned in Dublin in late 1880. When it seemed that the Land League men were likely to be arrested, it was suggested that a women's league in Ireland could take over the work in their absence. Public opinion at the time was against women in politics, but the Ladies' Land League was founded on 31 January 1881 with Anna as its effective leader. When Charles Parnell and other leaders were imprisoned in 1881, as predicted, the Ladies' Land League took over their work. Though it was envisioned as a place holder until the men were released, Anna organised branches throughout Ireland, encouraging women to play an active role in Land League activities. Offices were given to the ladies but little help. They raised funds for the League and for the support of prisoners and their families. They distributed Land League wooden huts to shelter evicted tenant families and by the beginning of 1882 they had 500 branches, thousands of women members and considerable publicity. They distributed in relief aid. This put the Ladies' Land League in serious debt. Anna approached Charles, requesting money to settle the debts. Charles, who distrusted Anna's understanding of politics, agreed to provide the money under the condition that the Ladies' Land League be disbanded. Anna agreed, disbanding in 1882, but she never forgave Charles. Later life The grave of Anna Catherine Parnell in the churchyard of Holy Trinity Church, Ilfracombe After her brother's death in 1891 Anna lived the rest of her life in the south of England under the assumed name Cerisa Palmer. She wrote an angry account of her Land League experiences in Tale of a Great Sham, which was not published until 1986. She made one last political appearance when she campaigned for a Sinn F√©in candidate in a 1907 by-election.

A northern- hemisphere gyre in geostrophic balance. Paler water is less dense than dark water, but more dense than air; the outwards pressure gradient is balanced by the 90 degrees-right-of-flow coriolis force. The structure will eventually dissipate due to friction and mixing of water properties. A geostrophic current is an oceanic current in which the pressure gradient force is balanced by the Coriolis effect. The direction of geostrophic flow is parallel to the isobars, with the high pressure to the right of the flow in the Northern Hemisphere, and the high pressure to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. This concept is familiar from weather maps, whose isobars show the direction of geostrophic flow in the atmosphere. Geostrophic flow may be either barotropic or baroclinic. A geostrophic current may also be thought of as a rotating shallow water wave with a frequency of zero. The principle of geostrophy is useful to oceanographers because it allows them to infer ocean currents from measurements of the sea surface height (by combined satellite altimetry and gravimetry) or from vertical profiles of seawater density taken by ships or autonomous buoys. The major currents of the world's oceans, such as the Gulf Stream, the Kuroshio Current, the Agulhas Current, and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, are all approximately in geostrophic balance and are examples of geostrophic currents.  Simple explanation  Sea water naturally tends to move from a region of high pressure (or high sea level) to a region of low pressure (or low sea level). The force pushing the water towards the low pressure region is called the pressure gradient force. In a geostrophic flow, instead of water moving from a region of high pressure (or high sea level) to a region of low pressure (or low sea level), it moves along the lines of equal pressure (isobars). This occurs because the Earth is rotating. The rotation of the earth results in a \\"force\\" being felt by the water moving from the high to the low, known as Coriolis force. The Coriolis force acts at right angles to the flow, and when it balances the pressure gradient force, the resulting flow is known as geostrophic. As stated above, the direction of flow is with the high pressure to the right of the flow in the Northern Hemisphere, and the high pressure to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. The direction of the flow depends on the hemisphere, because the direction of the Coriolis force is opposite in the different hemispheres. Formulation The geostrophic equations are a simplified form of the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations in a rotating reference frame. In particular, it is assumed that there is no acceleration (steady-state), that there is no viscosity, and that the pressure is hydrostatic. The resulting balance is (Gill, 1982): : fv = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho} \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial x} : fu = -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho} \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial y} where f is the Coriolis parameter, \\\\rho is the density, p is the pressure and u,v are the velocities in the x,y-directions respectively. One special property of the geostrophic equations, is that they satisfy the steady-state version of the continuity equation. That is: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial v}{\\\\partial y} = 0  Rotating waves of zero frequency  The equations governing a linear, rotating shallow water wave are: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} - fv = -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho} \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial x} : \\\\frac{\\\\partial v}{\\\\partial t} + fu = -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho} \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial y} The assumption of steady-state made above (no acceleration) is: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial v}{\\\\partial t} =0 Alternatively, we can assume a wave-like, periodic, dependence in time: : u \\\\propto v \\\\propto e^{i \\\\omega t} In this case, if we set \\\\omega = 0 , we have reverted to the geostrophic equations above. Thus a geostrophic current can be thought of as a rotating shallow water wave with a frequency of zero.

One of the non-conformists of the 1930s, he addressed the perils of totalitarianism from a Christian point of view. After the Second World War, he promoted European federalism. Life He studied at the University of Neuch√¢tel and in Vienna, and then moved to Paris in 1930. There he wrote for and edited various publications, associating with the personalist groupings and the non-conformists of the 1930s: with Emmanuel Mounier and Arnaud Dandieu, he founded the magazines Esprit and L'Ordre Nouveau, and he also founded a magazine on existential theology, Hic et Nunc.Denis de Rougemont (1956/1966), Love in the Western World, trans., Montgomery Belgion, revised edition, reprint, New York: Fawcett, p. [i]. In June 1940, fearing that defeatism and the pressure of Nazi propaganda (and armies) would lead the federal government to submit to the Germans and give up the traditional democratic values of Switzerland, he led with Zurich University Professor Theophil Spoerri a group of young people which created a civil society organisation called the Gotthard League in order to defend both Christian values and the independence of Switzerland. De Rougemont wrote the movement's manifesto and on 22 July an \\"Appeal to the Swiss People\\" which was widely published in the Swiss press to rally support for the movement.Christian Ackermann, Denis de Rougemont : une biographie intellectuelle, Labor et Fides, 1996, 1284 pages, , p. 652 Later in 1940, after having authored a sharp column in a Swiss newspaper which infuriated the German government, he was sent to the United States and administered French broadcasting for the Voice of America.

The film is narrated by Joaquin Phoenix, features music by Moby, was directed by Shaun Monson, executive produced by Libra Max and was co-produced by Maggie Q. A sequel titled Unity was released in 2015. Synopsis Covering pet stores, puppy mills, and various animal professions, Earthlings includes footage obtained through the use of hidden cameras to chronicle the day-to-day practices of some of the largest industries in the world, all of which rely on animals. Then, the film draws parallels between speciesism and racism, sexism, and more. Production The film started off as footage that writer, director, and producer Shaun Monson had shot at animal shelters around Los Angeles in 1999. Monson originally shot the footage for PSAs on spaying and neutering pets, but what he saw moved him so much that he turned it into a documentary. The film would take another six years to complete because of the difficulty of obtaining footage within these industries. Promotion Joaquin Phoenix commented on the documentary, \\"Of all the films I have ever made, this is the one that gets people talking the most. For every one person who sees Earthlings, they will tell three.\\" Animal rights philosopher Tom Regan remarked, \\"For those who watch Earthlings, the world will never be the same.\\" Accolades In 2005, Earthlings premiered at the Artivist Film Festival (where it won Best Documentary Feature), followed by the Boston International Film Festival (where it won the Best Content Award) and the San Diego Film Festival (where it won Best Documentary Film, as well as the Humanitarian Award to Phoenix for his work on the film). Connection to the Lutsk hostage crisis On July 21, 2020, Maksym Kryvosh seized a bus with 13 people on board in the city of Lutsk, Volyn Oblast, Ukraine, and demanded, among other things, that President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky publish a post in which he recommended Earthlings to everyone. Within a few hours, Zelensky fulfilled Kryvosh's demand, posting a Facebook video in which he said in Russian, \\"Everyone should watch the 2005 film Earthlings.\\" Kryvosh then released three hostages. After a standoff with police, Kryvosh was arrested, the other 10 hostages were released, all unharmed, and the President's recommendation video was deleted. The next day, Shaun Monson reacted to the incident by saying that Earthlings' does not endorse or condone acts of terror, as its message is one of compassion for all beings. [...] Our hearts go out to all those impacted by this ordeal, to their families, as well as the authorities who ensured that no lives were lost. May we move forward with non-violence toward all.\\" See also * List of vegan media * Our Daily Bread (2005 film) * Pig Business (film) References External links 2005 documentary films 2005 films American documentary films American films Anti-modernist films Documentary films about animal rights Documentary films about vegetarianism English- language films Films shot in Los Angeles County Vegetarianism in the United States ","title":"Earthlings (film)"},{"id":"6410761","text":"Benwood may refer to Places *Benwood, Indiana *Benwood, West Virginia Ships *, a Norwegian cargo ship sunk during World War II. *, a British coaster in service 1947-51 ","title":"Benwood"},{"id":"6410823","text":"Livets √§ndh√•llplats is the second album by Shining.

Looney Tunes animated cartoon directed by Frank Tashlin. The short was released on October 30, 1937, and stars Porky Pig and Petunia Pig. The title is a parody of The Case of the Stuttering Bishop, a Perry Mason mystery that Warner Bros. had filmed earlier that year. Plot On a dark and stormy night, Porky and his brothers (Patrick, Percy, Portis, Peter) and sister (Petunia) learn from lawyer Goodwill that they are set to inherit a fortune from their deceased rich uncle Solomon, with the \\"kindly\\" lawyer next in line after them. After Goodwill leaves, he walks into a secret laboratory and drinks a bottle of Jekyll and Hyde juice and turns into a hideous monster bent on killing them. The monster breaks the fourth wall and warns the audience not to interfere, with special emphasis by threatening the guy in the third row (whom was voiced by Mel Blanc). One by one, he kidnaps the brothers, leaving only Porky and Petunia. As Porky and Petunia walk through the house, trying to find their brothers, the monster grabs Petunia, unbeknownst to Porky, and then starts trailing Porky. When Porky sees the monster, he screams and runs up the stairs, only to meet the monster at the top. He then screams and runs down the stairs, into the laboratory where the monster is holding his siblings prisoner. No sooner has Porky freed them than the monster breaks in and corners all of the pigs. Just when it seems the monster is going to kill them, a thrown theater chair (seemingly out of nowhere) flies into the monster, trapping him in the stocks where he had them in earlier. All six pigs (amazed by the incident): Who did that?! Mel Blanc (shouting angrily): ME! Monster (shocked at who attacked him): Who are YOU?! Mel Blanc (replying angrily): I'm the guy in the third row, ya big sourpuss!!!

He was best known for his published engravings which included caricatures, political cartoons, and commentary on contemporary life. Heath was born in Northumberland. His early works often dealt with military scenes, including colour plates for The Martial Achievements, The Wars of Wellington, etc., but from about 1820 on he focused on satire. Between 1827 and 1829, many of his works were published under the pseudonym \\"Paul Pry\\" (the name of an overly inquisitive stage character in a popular 1825 stage comedy by John Poole ); also used the pseudonym Argus. He was described by Dr John Brown, biographer of John Leech as \\"poor Heath, the ex-Captain of Dragoons, facile and profuse, unscrupulous and clever\\". Heath helped found an early caricature magazines, The Glasgow Looking Glass (renamed to The Northern Looking Glass after five issues). Heath created a numbered series of political Caricatures between 1830 and 1834 for McLean's Monthly. He died in Hampstead, London. The British Museum catalogue has over 160 works by Heath.

This teen trio represented the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest 1983 with the song \\"I'm Never Giving Up\\". Overview The band was put together specifically to perform \\"I'm Never Giving Up\\" in A Song for Europe 1983, the United Kingdom's preliminary round to the 1983 Eurovision Song Contest. Sweet Dreams were often compared to the band Bucks Fizz,Evening Times; 19 August 1983 article; p.12. because they were both mixed-gender bands. Bucks Fizz was a band from the UK, which won the 1981 Eurovision Song Contest with the song \\"Making Your Mind Up.\\" Bucks Fizz was the evident prototype for several acts entered in the 1982 UK edition of A Song for Europe‚Äîincluding \\"Lovin' Feeling,\\" another A Song for Europe 1983 entrant. In 1982, \\"Lovin' Feeling\\" had featured McVay (in an otherwise female quartet) and had finished fourth with the song \\"Different Worlds, Different People.\\" A Song for Europe 1983 Sweet Dreams was the first of the eight contestants to perform on the BBC-TV A Song for Europe broadcast live from the BBC Television Theatre on 24 March 1983. Based on the tally from eight regional juries, \\"I'm Never Giving Up\\" was named the UK entrant for Eurovision 1983, receiving 109 points. In second place was \\"We've got all the Time in the World\\" by the band Mirror (also composed of two females and one male), which received 91 points. Eurovision 1983 On the night of Eurovision 1983, held at Rudi-Sedlmayer- Halle in Munich, Sweet Dreams performed \\"I'm Never Giving Up\\" third in a field of twenty. They finished the contest in sixth place. In 2008, Carrie Gray (now known as Carrie Grant) stated \\"We came sixth, which actually at the time was really shameful, but these days that would be a serious result.\\" The sixth- place finish of \\"I'm Never Giving Up\\" at Eurovision 1983 largely replicated the UK' standing at Eurovision 1982 when \\"One Step Further\\" by Bardo had finished seventh: however while \\"One Step Further\\" had afforded Bardo a #2 UK hit \\"I'm Never Giving Up\\" rose no higher than #21 UK - in spite of a Top of the Pops appearance. Later career Sweet Dreams released a follow-up single \\"17 Electric (Look Out!)\\" in August 1983. To downplay the group's Eurovision association, the single was credited to \\"Dreams\\". However, \\"17 Electric (Look Out!)\\" failed to chart, precipitating the dissolution of the Sweet Dreams/Dreams trio by the end of 1983. Carrie Grant commented on the failure of \\"I'm Never Giving Up\\" to become a major hit or to afford Sweet Dreams any lasting success, saying, \\"Eurovision was so popular [in the UK] when I was growing up. It started to go off the boil [in 1983 when] there was a backlash for the first time.\\" \\"I'm Never Giving Up\\" also gave Sweet Dreams a Top 30 hit in Ireland (#25). After the disbanding of the group, Gray went on to become a TV presenter, presenting Fame Academy among others, while McVay became a radio presenter and later resumed his singing career when he joined The Fizz in 2015.

In 2016, Berne Union members collectively provided payment risk protection to banks, exporters and investors amounting to US$1.87 trillion. This total business volume represents cover of approximately 11% of total world cross border trade for goods and services, as recorded by WTO figures. Since the beginning of the global financial crisis in 2008, Berne Union members have paid claims of approximately US$40 billion.  History  The Berne union was founded in 1934 by private and state export credit insurers from France, Italy, Spain and the UK. The first meeting was held in Berne, Switzerland ‚Äì which is where the name Berne Union comes from. While Berne is still the legal domicile of the Union, it has not met there since 1939. Notable milestones include: * An expanded mandate in 1974, to include members who insure foreign investments * Creation of the 'Prague Club' in 1993, designed to support new and maturing export credit agencies and insurers setting up and developing export credit and investment insurance schemes * In 1999, the export credit members formed two committees, focusing on short term and medium/long term export credit business As of 2017, the modern Berne Union is structured around four committees, representing these two export credit groups (short term and medium/long term) along with an investment insurance committee and the so-called Prague Club Committee (PC), which was formally integrated in May 2016, having been a legally separate, but closely associated entity prior to this.  Governance  The Berne Union is led by the President, Vice President and a Management Committee, with each elected position held for a term of two years. The Management Committee are supported by a permanent Secretariat, led by the Secretary General and based in London, in the United Kingdom. The Current President is Ms Beatriz Reguero, Chief Operating Officer of State Account Business CESCE - the Spanish Export Credit Agency. She was elected in October 2018, at the association's Annual General Meeting in Paris for a term of two years. Current Vice President, Ms Christina Westholm-Schroder, Senior Vice President and Chief Underwriter Sovereign Risk Insurance, based in Bermuda - was elected in September 2019. Mr Vinco David was appointed Secretary General of the Berne Union in November 2016, with effect from March 2017.  Activities  Members of the Berne Union meet twice per year for the Spring General Meeting (in April/May) and the Annual General Meeting (in October / November). Throughout the year a further 5-6 meetings take place on specialist topics such as: claims and recoveries, country risk, project finance, reinsurance, data reporting etc.  Current Berne Union Members  References External links * Berne Union website * The Berne Union: An Overview Congressional Research Service Insurance industry organizations Organisations based in Bern Trade associations based in Switzerland ","title":"Berne Union"},{"id":"6411020","text":"The Daylight Saving Act of 1917 was enacted by the Dominion of Newfoundland to adopt daylight saving time (DST), thus making it one of the first jurisdictions in North America to do so, only a year after the United Kingdom on May 21, 1916. DST was not instituted in the United States until March 31, 1918. History While living in Paris in 1784, Benjamin Franklin wrote a satirical essay, in which he suggested that Parisians get up earlier in the morning. Modern DST was first proposed by the New Zealand entomologist George Vernon Hudson in 1895. William Willett, a London building contractor, independently invented DST and pitched it to the British Parliament in 1907. In that same year Willett spoke with John Anderson, who was on a business trip in Britain, and explained to him the benefits of adopting DST and its economic benefits. Germany and its allies were the first European countries to adopt DST in 1916, followed quickly by the United Kingdom and many other western European countries, all in an effort to save fuel during the First World War. Upon his return to Newfoundland, Anderson became a strong proponent of daylight saving time and three times introduced a bill to the Legislative Council for its adoption. The first two attempts, in 1909 and 1910, failed. In 1917, spurred on perhaps by the recent adoptions of DST in Europe, Anderson introduced a third bill which passed on June 17, 1917. The new law stated that at nine o'clock in the evening of the second Sunday in June clocks would be put ahead to ten o'clock and would not be turned back until the last Sunday in September. It is not clear exactly when clocks were put ahead in 1917, as the bill became law one week after DST was scheduled to take effect.Encyclopedia of Newfoundland and Labrador, . In St. John's DST was first applied on April 8, 1917, by virtue of a local ordinance.Doris Chase Doane, Time Changes in Canada and Mexico, 2nd edition, 1972. DST in Newfoundland came to be known as \\"Anderson‚Äôs Time\\", at least in the years immediately following its adoption. Daylight-saving time remained a provincial jurisdiction in Newfoundland since 1949. In 1952, the timing was changed such that it began just after midnight of the last Sunday in April and ended at midnight of the last Sunday in September. In 1970, it was extended to the midnight of the last Sunday in October.Mention of 1988 Act repealing the 1918 act at Daylight Saving Act ‚Äî 1918, c. 2History of the legislation concerning official time in QuebecNova Scotian Time Definition Act of 1989, Chapter 469 of the revised statutes, 1989 can be found on the Nova Scotian government website at Time Definition Act References Politics of Newfoundland and Labrador 1917 in law Daylight saving time in Canada Dominion of Newfoundland law 1917 in Newfoundland ","title":"Daylight Saving Act of 1917"},{"id":"6411026","text":"BMW 02 Baur-Cabrio A BMW BAUR Landaulet TC4 An Opel Kadett C 1.2 Aero BMW E21 320/6 Baur TC1 Baur is a Karosserie or coachbuilder in Stuttgart, Germany, which has been building BMW convertibles since the 1930s. Currently, they are the body and assembly works for IVM Automotive, a member of the Ed Group. They enjoy an excellent reputation for quality and do prototype work for many manufacturers such as Porsche, Audi and Ford. The Baur family received a patent for the design of a folding top for luxury automobiles around the time BMW was building the first car with the BMW name. Baur was established in 1910 and produced, among others, 1,682 1600-2 Cabriolets, 200 2002 Cabriolets, 2,597 E110 700 Sport Cabriolets and most of the 450 or so M1's (after Lamborghini was unable to fulfil its contractual obligations). In 1971 they began production of the safer \\"Targa-style\\" body with the 2002. (Targa was a registered Porsche name, so they had to call it something else.) Originally an aftermarket option available through BMW dealers, the E21 3 Series TC1 was built with full factory authorization, and covered under the factory warranty. The roll-bar version or \\"Top Cabrio\\" (TC) continued with the E30 TC2 even after Baur developed the BMW E30 Convertible design for BMW, and which BMW built. The Opel Kadett C Aero was produced from 1976 to 1978, with a Baur top. Then there was the Baur TC3 of 1987, which was stopped by the production of the BMW Z1. The cars were aimed at the same market. Even though BMW now had its own E36 convertible, E36 Baur TC4 conversions were still available, although this iteration was based on the E36 four-door and featured fixed door frames.Eberhard Kittler: Deutsche Autos seit 1990, vol. 5. Motorbuch Verlag, Stuttgart 2001, , p. 262. These TC cars can be built at any time, on an aftermarket basis; the owner supplies the car to be converted. All Porsche 959s were actually produced at Baur, not at Porsche, on an assembly line with Porsche inspectors overseeing the finished bodies. Most of Porsche's special- order interior leatherwork was also done by the workers at Baur. At one time all suspension components for the Audi Quattro suspension unique to that model were produced by robotic welding equipment at Baur. In 2002, the Baur G-Cabrio XL, a convertible based on the Mercedes-Benz G-Class, was shown at the Geneva Auto Show.

She was named after the constellation Aquarius. She was one of a handful of World War II AKAs manned by officers and crew from the United States Coast Guard. She served as a commissioned ship for 2 years and 9 months.  History  Aquarius (AKA-16) was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 205) on 28 April 1943 at Kearny, N.J., by the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Co.; launched on 23 July 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Edmund E. Brady, Jr.; acquired by the Navy on 20 August 1943; and commissioned on 21 August 1943, Capt. R. V. Marron, USCG, in command. Manned by a Coast Guard crew, she conducted brief shakedown training in Chesapeake Bay and sailed on 15 September via the Panama Canal to the west coast. Reaching San Francisco on 19 October, she loaded cargo and embarked passengers for transportation to Hawaii. She reached Pearl Harbor on 28 October and then returned to San Diego where she reported for duty to the 5th Amphibious Force, Pacific Fleet, and was assigned to Transport Division 24. Following a repair period lasting until 25 November, she embarked Marines and got underway for amphibious training exercises off the California coast. On 4 January 1944, she sailed for Hawaii. She joined Task Force (TF) 53 at Pearl Harbor and sortied on 22 January for the invasion of the Marshall Islands. She stood into the transport area off Roi and Namur Islands, Kwajalein Atoll, on 31 January and from then until 6 February, unloaded her cargo and disembarked troops. On 10 February, she arrived at Funafuti, Ellice Islands, where she joined the 3d Fleet. During the remainder of February and into early March, she operated in the Solomon Islands conducting amphibious training exercises with Army troops. On 21 March, she moved to Noumea, New Caledonia; loaded Army personnel and equipment; and took them to Emirau Island to serve as a garrison force. From Emirau, she embarked troops of the 4th Marine Regiment and took them back to Guadalcanal. Between 20 April and 28 April, she carried elements of the Army's 40th Division to Cape Gloucester, New Britain, and returned the 1st Marine Division to the Russell Islands. Following repairs at Espiritu Santo, Aquarius returned to Guadalcanal to conduct rehearsals with the 3d Marine Division for the projected assault on the Marianas. On 4 June, she departed Guadalcanal with TF 53 and proceeded to Kwajalein, the staging base for the operation. This force had orders to act as a floating reserve during the Saipan landings and, when directed, to invade Guam. TF 53 sortied from Kwajalein on the 12th. However, the engagement with the Japanese Mobile Fleet in the Battle of the Philippine Sea and the unexpectedly fierce resistance of the Japanese garrison on Saipan caused the invasion of Guam to be postponed. After standing-by for over a fortnight, Aquarius and the other ships for TF 53 put into Eniwetok on 28 June to await further orders. They sortied again on 17 July and reached Guam on 21 July. By 26 July, all of her cargo was unloaded, and she sailed for Eniwetok. From there, she proceeded on to Espiritu Santo, where she arrived on 6 August. After a week of provisioning, she moved to Guadalcanal. During the rest of August, she took part in training exercises for the assault on Peleliu. She got underway with TG 32.17 early in September and entered the transport area off Peleliu on 15 September. She remained in the area unloading cargo and receiving casualties from the beach until 22 September. Aquarius then headed for Hollandia, New Guinea, where she arrived on 25 September. After embarking Army personnel for exercises in the Humboldt Bay area, she sortied on 13 October with TG 78.1 for the invasion of Leyte. On A-day, 20 October, she was anchored in San Pedro Bay and began unloading her cargo. She left the area the next day and returned to Hollandia, and made another run to Leyte in mid-November. By the end of November, she was at Aitape, New Guinea, to load more Army units. She sailed on 28 December with TG 78.1 to support the landings at Lingayen Gulf. She reached the invasion area on 9 January 1945, completed unloading the next day, and retired to Leyte on 13 January. She took on cargo and personnel for the impending Zimbales-Subic Bay operations. She reached that area on 29 January and two days later was back in Leyte. Late in February, she proceeded via Hollandia to Guadalcanal and held training exercises off Guadalcanal until sailing for Ulithi on 15 March. On 27 March she sortied with Transport Division 36 for the assault on Okinawa. Aquarius remained off Okinawa from 1 April to 9 April, resupplying other ships. She got underway again on the latter day; called at Saipan on 13 April; Pearl Harbor on 26 April; and arrived at Seattle, Wash., on 4 May to begin overhaul. The yard period ended on 12 July, and she conducted refresher training off the west coast. While she was still in Californian waters Japan capitulated. She departed San Diego on 18 August, arrived at Guam on 4 September, and moved to Saipan three days later to load cargo and troops for use in the occupation of Japan. On 23 September, she anchored in the harbor of Nagasaki to begin unloading. Departing Japan on 26 September, she proceeded to Mindoro and Manila Bay, Philippines. On 23 October, she sailed from Manila with TG 78.7 bound for Hong Kong. During the next two months, she shuttled Chinese troops and supplies between Hong Kong, Chinwangtao, and Tsingtao. She returned to Seattle on 13 December. She remained on the west coast until February 1946, then proceeded to New York where she was placed out of commission on 23 May. She was turned over to the War Shipping Administration on 12 September, and her name was struck from the Navy list on 13 November 1946. She was subsequently sold to U.S. Lines on 12 February 1947.Maritime Administration Ship Record Detail: Aquarius Aquarius earned eight battle stars for her World War II service. * NEEDS MINOR REWRITE * This history as written, makes the Aquarius sound like it was just a cargo ship. That is not true at all. The ship carried the landing craft that actually took the troops to the beaches. Many of the AKA ships came in closer to the islands than any other and some were heavily damaged by enemy fire and a few were sunk.

It specifies a code of practice for use by manufacturers of such containers. With the publication of BS EN 13121-3, BS 4994:1987 Specification for design and construction of vessels and tanks in reinforced plastics is declared obsolescent, which will still cover those tanks still in service as tanks made from GRP are generally accepted to have a long working life. Dual laminate construction, simple FRP with glass mats, or a combination of unidirectional filament winding are common. DUAL LAMINATE : A thermoplastic lining material, preferably 3mm to 5mm thick sheet functions as a corrosion barrier. This thermoplastic liner is not considered to contribute mechanical strength. FRP which is constructed over this lining provides the strength requirements for materials to withstand design conditions like pressure, vacuum, hydrostatic load, etc. The choice of thermoplastic is based on the chemical corrosion requirement of the equipment. PP, PVC, PTFE, ECTFE, CPVC, PVDF are used as common thermoplastic liners. FRP (GRP): Glass mats in the form of chopped strand mat and woven roving is most common in hand lay-up method. These mats are laid on the mold and impregnated with 'initiated' resins like polyester, epoxy, vinyl ester, bisphenol epoxy vinyl ester, etc. The choice of resin is based on the chemical corrosion requirement of the equipment. An earlier version of the specification was BS 4994:1973. NEW LOAD UNITS: It is to avoid the uncertainty associated with specifying the thickness alone, that BS4994 introduced the concept of \\"unit properties\\". It is property per unit width, per unit mass of reinforcement. For example, UNIT STRENGTH is defined as load in Newtons per millimeter (of laminate width) for a layer consisting of 1 kg of glass per square meter, i.e., the unit is N/mm per kg/m2 glass.

Biography He was born on 6 October 1714, at Venice and christened Giovanni Domenico. The son of a rich merchant, he sacrificed at an early date his prospects of success in the world and took the religious habit of the Camaldolese monks at the Monastery of St. Michael, situated on the island of Murano in the Venetian lagoon. Here he studied philosophy and theology with more than usual success. At the age of twenty- three he revealed his literary ability in a letter (Lettera critica) written in defense of certain Camaldolese writers, who had been attacked by Giusto Fontanini in his \\"Library of Italian Eloquence\\". Costadoni subsequently collaborated for eighteen years with the learned Dom Gian Benedetto Mittarelli of his monastery in the publication of the \\"Annales Camaldulenses ordinis S. Benedicti, ab anno 907 ad annum 1770\\" (The Annals of the Camaldolese of the Order of St. Benedict, 907-1770), printed in 9 volumes folio (Venice, 1755‚Äì73). It follows the plan of Mabillon's \\"Annales ordinis S. Benedicti\\". (Venice, 1755‚Äì73). He died on 23 January 1785, in Venice. Works Some arch√¶ological papers due to his pen, such as \\"Dissertazione sopra il pesce come simbolo degli antichi cristiani\\", were published in the voluminous collection of historical essays edited by Caloger√†, a monk of the same Order. His works also include: \\"Avvisi ed istruzioni pratiche intorno ai principali doveri de' regolari\\" (Faenza, 1770; Venice, 1771); \\"Lettere consolatorie\\" (Venice, 1775); \\"Lettere sopra questione teologiche\\" (Venice, 1773). Costadoni's unpublished manuscripts were transferred, after his death, to St. Gregory's monastery at Rome, by order of the Camaldolese abbot, Mauro Cappellari (later Pope Gregory XVI).

Frank Sinatra sang a version on his radio show (Your Hit Parade, 1945) that appeared on many compilation albums. Uses in popular culture The song (vocals by Kitty Kallen) was used in two films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, notable as a tragically ironic piece of music representing Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) and love interest Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) being torn apart by time. It is first used in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, when Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) is hiding in Steve‚Äôs apartment after an assassination attempt by HYDRA agents in the streets of Washington DC, before he is shot by the Winter Soldier. It is later used at the end of Avengers: Endgame when Steve travels back in time and chooses to live out his life with Peggy. The two share a slow dance to the song, a reference to the dance date Rogers promised Carter right before he was lost in ice for 70 years in Captain America: The First Avenger.

The school was established in 1946 as Air Rescue Service' under Air Transport Command, little more than a year before the United States Air Force's designation as a separate military service in September 1947. From June 1948 until 1983, it was a technical service of Military Air Transport Service (later Military Airlift Command), when it became part of Twenty-Third Air Force. It returned to Military Airlift Command control and was transferred to Air Combat Command in 1993. The fixed- wing and helicopter air crews of the command were credited with 996 combat saves in the Korean War and 2,780 in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. The unit's motto was: \\"That Others May Live.\\" ARRS returned to its former name of ARS in 1989. The current structure and strength of search and rescue in today's U.S. Air Force is focused primarily on combat search and rescue (CSAR) and Personnel Recovery (PR) and is greatly reduced from the air rescue force structure that served from 1946 through the end of the Vietnam Era. Origins Presaging the mainstay of the post-World War II USAF rescue structure, the first U.S. Army Air Forces helicopter rescue was performed by Lieutenant Carter Harman in Burma behind Japanese lines on 25‚Äì26 April 1944. First Air Commando Sergeant Pilot Ed \\"Murphy\\" Hladovcak had crash-landed his L-1 aircraft with three wounded British soldiers on board. Taxing his YR-4 helicopter to its performance limits, Harmon made four flights to the site, making the final hasty liftoff just as shouting soldiers burst from the jungle. He learned later the soldiers were not Japanese, but an Allied land rescue party. In March 1946, the Air Rescue Service was established under the Air Transport Command to provide rescue coverage for the continental United States. By 1949, ARS aircraft covered all the world‚Äôs transport routes. The Air Rescue Service emblem was created by Tech Sgt William R. Steffens stationed at Hickam Airforce Base in 1952. The emblem was selected by the government to be used as the official logo for Air Rescue Service until the branch had disestablished and Pararescue was created. The guardian angel and Latin phrase Ut Alique Viva, (trans) That Others May Live, are still used in the current logo for the United States Air Force Pararescue.'That Others May Live' Petoskey veteran wins design contest, finds out his emblem was approved 61 years later, petoskeynews.com, by Catherine Dewey, dated 11 October 2013, last accessed 15 May 2020 Korea and the Cold War During the Korean War, the mounting use of helicopters on rescue missions helped save more lives. By the time of the Korean Armistice, ARS crews were credited with rescuing 9,898 personnel, including 996 in combat situations.\\"Rescue.\\" National Museum of the United States Air Force. Retrieved: 19 March 2018. After the Korean War, the USAF Air Rescue Service resumed worldwide operations for rescue coverage and ARS squadrons flew hundreds of humanitarian relief and rescue missions, primarily using the HU-16 Albatross fixed-wing amphibious aircraft and the UH-19 and HH-19 versions of the H-19 Chickasaw helicopter. In 1954, ARS moved its headquarters to Orlando Air Force Base, Florida. The HU-16, which began Pacific service during the Korean and Vietnam conflicts, was returned to the continental United States in 1968, after 18 years of active use. In the late 1950s, the USAF bought the H-43 Huskie for use on or near air force bases and air bases, followed by the CH-3E Sea King/HH-3E Jolly Green Giant helicopter and the HC-130 Hercules, a modified version of the C-130 Hercules tactical airlift aircraft, in the mid-1960s. On 1 January 1966, concurrent with the redesignation of the Military Air Transport Service (MATS) as the Military Airlift Command (MAC), the Air Rescue Service was redesignated as the Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Service (ARRS) to reflect its additional role of worldwide rescue and recovery support for manned U.S. space flights by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Vietnam War The Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Service peacetime force was not equipped, trained, or structured to meet the demands of war in Southeast Asia in the early 1960s. As lessons were learned, the service's rescue capability increased. During the Vietnam War, ARRS crews would save 4,120 people, 2,780 of them in combat situations. At the outset of the Vietnam War, the USAF's primary rescue helicopter was the HH-43B \\"Huskie\\" manufactured by Kaman Aircraft, which had added a firefighting and better crash rescue capability to secure USAF orders. But the HH-43 was slow, short-ranged and unarmed, having been procured primarily for the local base recovery (LBR) mission at air force bases in the United States and overseas. The LBR concept also included a fire suppression role, with an external AFFF foam bottle and firefighters as part of the flight crew. During June 1961, the HH-43 helicopters, crews, and support personnel of the various major commands were reassigned from their respective home bases and host wings to the Air Rescue Service in an attempt to unify their command structure. Standardized training and mission concepts were also implemented. As the Vietnam War escalated, HH-43 rescue detachments from bases in the continental United States (CONUS) were deployed to air bases in Vietnam and elsewhere in Southeast Asia (SEA) with the new nickname and callsign of \\"Pedro.\\" The HH-43B's combat radius of only was increased with added fuel drums strapped in the cabin. It was eventually replaced with the armored HH-43F model, which had additional internal fuel tanks, for use in Area Crew Recovery (ACR) mission. The HH-43F units were staffed with USAF Pararescue personnel as part of the combat recovery team. Throughout the war, both HH-43B and HH-43F helicopters flew deep into North Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. HH-43 crews saved more lives than any other USAF rescue helicopter in the Vietnam War.\\"Kaman HH-43B Huskie.\\" National Museum of the United States Air Force. Retrieved: 19 March 2018. USAF air rescue team In July 1965, ARS received its first CH-3C, an aircraft considered an adequate aircrew rescue vehicle. Airborne command-and-control of rescue operations was provided in December 1965 with the introduction of the modified Lockheed HC-130H CROWN airborne controller. With the introduction of the HC-130P/N, the air- refuelable HH-3E \\"Jolly Green Giant\\" in June 1967, and the delivery of the air-refuelable HH-53B \\"Super Jolly Green Giant\\" (the first helicopter specifically designed for combat search and rescue (CSAR) operations) later that year (the latter two aircraft both being dual-engined helicopters), the now-renamed Military Airlift Command (MAC) and ARRS judged that they finally had the right force structure for combat rescue operations in Vietnam. Other aircraft that were on the rescue mission team included the low and slow-flying Forward Air Controllers (FACs) of the Tactical Air Command (TAC), call sign \\"Nail,\\" a frequent rescue force component flying the O-1E Bird Dog, and later the O-2A Skymaster. \\"Nail\\" would initially serve as the on-scene commander during a rescue operation until the arrival of Air Force HC-130 Hercules aircraft using the call sign \\"King,\\" augmented by Douglas A-1 Skyraider aircraft using the call sign \\"Sandy.\\" The \\"Nail\\" aircraft helped locate the downed crew, marking the location with smoke for the \\"Sandys\\" and pickup helicopters using the callsigns \\"Pedro\\" or \\"Jolly,\\" and directing close air support (CAS) against enemy ground troops. In 1968, when Orlando AFB was turned over to the U.S. Navy and redesignated Naval Training Center Orlando, ARRS stateside headquarters moved to Scott AFB, Illinois, and embedded in MAC headquarters. In 1970, TAC-operated OV-10 Bronco aircraft began working with search and rescue forces, replacing the slower unarmed O-1 Bird Dogs and O-2 Skymasters as FAC aircraft. OV-10s equipped with PAVE NAIL night observation equipment could locate survivors at night or in bad weather and helped develop rescue operations that relied more on advanced technology. One Department of Defense report said that one Air Force search and rescue crewman and two aircraft were lost for every 9.2 recoveries in Vietnam, while the Navy lost a crewman for every 1.8 recoveries. ARRS had begun to build its reputation as the world's finest combat rescue force. However, the ARRS continued to be plagued by its own shortsightedness, even as new tactics and doctrine for combined rescue operations were developed. As late as October 1970, Colonel Frederick V. Sohle, commander of the 3d Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Group, would say, \\"Our development . . . has been a history of relearning lessons already learned by someone else, but who unfortunately could not or did not document it for others to profit by.\\" This lack of documentation and the inability to integrate an institutional memory among ARRS forces (with the possible exception of the pararescue force) would hamper CSAR units well into the 1980s. Consequently, the CSAR mission became subordinate to daily support and auxiliary mission roles. If one lesson could be drawn from the Vietnam War, it was that an effective CSAR force was needed. Unfortunately, the institutional Air Force failed to learn this lesson well and ARRS assets experienced the same neglect and lack of funding which plagued its ARS predecessor. From Vietnam to Desert Storm In addition to overseas taskings, stateside taskings for ARRS also continued. Before 1974, the Air Force had divided the continental United States into three regions, each with a separate Air Force Rescue Coordination Center. In addition to ARRS aircraft, these AFRCCs also coordinated the use of Civil Air Patrol volunteers and their CAP aircraft and ground support units in their role as the civilian USAF Auxiliary, primarily in searches for missing US civilian general aviation aircraft in the United States, leaving stateside ARRS aircraft and units to concentrate on training, stateside military aircraft mishaps, NASA support, or complex SAR or disaster evolutions that were outside the capability of the air and ground assets of local civilian authorities or the CAP. In May 1974, the Air Force consolidated the three centers into one facility at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois. This single-site Air Force Rescue Coordination Center (AFRCC) allowed co-location with Headquarters, Military Airlift Command; provided better coordination of activities; improved communications and economy of operations; and standardized procedures. The newly formed AFRCC also permitted operations with fewer people while creating a more experienced staff. The withdrawal of U.S. combat forces from the Vietnam War was reminiscent of the massive drawdown of CSAR assets that occurred following the Korean War. After Vietnam, a few notable rescue operations took place, such as the deployment of ARRS helicopters aboard the in June and August 1979 in support of a possible emergency evacuation of US personnel in Nicaragua following the Communist Sandinista takeover. However, such missions occurred infrequently. As 1976 began, the ARRS had its headquarters and staff at Scott AFB, Illinois, and commanded three wings and numerous separate squadrons, detachments, and operating locations. Its subordinate wings were the 39th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Wing (39 ARRW), the 41st Rescue and Weather Reconnaissance Wing (41 RWRW), and the 1550th Aircrew Training and Test Wing. Ironically, a classic contingency/rescue operation proved to be the death knell of the ARRS and, even more ironically, no ARRS helicopter units participated in the operation. The aborted mission to rescue the American Embassy hostages in Teheran, Iran in the spring of 1980 dramatically demonstrated the need for close, realistic coordination and planning of joint-service operations. While it is easy to speculate after the fact about what could have been done differently to make the mission successful, there was little doubt that the ARRS MH-53J Pave Low III aircraft was better suited to the operation. However, modified U.S. Navy RH-53D Sea Stallion mine sweeping aircraft with U.S. Marine Corps flight crews were used instead. In multiple analyses of the aborted rescue attempt, two possible reasons for the use of the RH-53D have been postulated: (1) either the Pave Low system was not yet ready for this type of mission because it had just finished lengthy operational testing or, (2) the RH-53D was used to placate the U.S. Marine Corps so they could participate with an aircraft that more closely approximated their own USMC CH-53D Sea Stallions. Certainly, one must concede that Pave Low aircrews, who were trained in the CSAR arena and routinely relied on HC-130s and MC-130s in their daily operations, were the logical choice for this type of mission and had a better aircraft with which to conduct it. Whatever the case, one point is clear: the entire operation was critically dependent on helicopters. As a result of the botched operation, the U.S. Air Force transferred all ARRS HH-53Es (MH-53E Pave Low III aircraft) to the 1st Special Operations Wing (SOW) and what was then Tactical Air Command control in May 1980. This transfer signaled the end of the ARRS's role in CSAR and precipitated the present distinctions between \\"rescue drivers\\" and \\"special operators.\\" Thus, the ARRS was left with an aging fleet of UH-1/HH-1 Iroquois or \\"Huey\\" (various series), CH-3E and HH-3E Jolly Green Giant aircraft, augmented by HC-130N and HC-130P/N Hercules aircraft converted from C-130E airframes. In effect, the ARRS had no means to accomplish the CSAR mission in the threat environment of the 1980s and 1990s. While the 20-plus- year-old UH-1, with 1960s and 1970s avionics, was no longer useful, the HH-3E continued to provide a measure of effectiveness because of its air-refueling capability and the use of night vision goggles (NVGs). The latter feature allowed aircrews to operate under the cover of darkness, thus decreasing their vulnerability in low-to-medium threat environments. Although ARRS no longer had the proper mix of aircraft to conduct modern CSAR operations, it continued to train crews in the CSAR environment, with emphasis on NVG operations. However, the inactivation of the HH-1 CSAR units in September 1987 closed a valuable pipeline of CSAR-trained aircrew members and limited the combat rescue role to a total of four overseas HH-3E Jolly Green Giant units and a stateside MH-60G special operations-capable Pave Hawk squadron. Furthermore, developments in the mid-1980s called into questions whether the MH-60G would continue to be affiliated with ARRS or with Military Airlift Command's newly formed 23rd Air Force for special operations following the divestiture of all USAF special operations forces from Tactical Air Command (TAC). In August 1989, ARRS was reorganized and reestablished as the Air Rescue Service (ARS) at McClellan AFB, California, again as a subcommand to Military Airlift Command (MAC). However, following Operation DESERT STORM in 1991, subsequent major USAF reorganizations resulted in the disestablishment of Military Airlift Command, the divestment of its C-130 tactical/theater airlift assets to U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) and the newly created Air Combat Command (ACC), and the integration of its C-141 and C-5 strategic airlift assets with the KC-135 and KC-10 air refueling aircraft assets of the former Strategic Air Command (SAC) in order to create the new Air Mobility Command.ACC C-130 assets would later be transferred back to AMC, while USAFE and PACAF C-130 assets remained under their respective control. Meanwhile, MAC's former Twenty-Third Air Force became the nucleus for the new Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC). Subsequent Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) decisions in the 1990s also marked McClellan AFB for closure. Shortly thereafter in 1993, ARS was again disestablished, with most of its CSAR assets transferred to the Air Combat Command (ACC) that had been created by the merger of SAC bomber and strategic reconnaissance forces with the fighter and AWACS assets of the former Tactical Air Command (TAC). Concurrently, a smaller number of forward-based CSAR assets in Europe and the Pacific were transferred to USAFE and PACAF, respectively. In 1993, concurrent with the disestablishment of MAC and the transfer of peacetime and combat search and rescue responsibilities to ACC, the AFRCC moved from Scott AFB to Langley Air Force Base, Virginia. In October 2003, CSAR was temporarily put under AFSOC, resulting in what was thought would be a merger of Regular Air Force, Air Force Reserve Command, and Air National Guard HC-130P/N assets with MC-130P Combat Shadow assets and integration of HH-60G Pave Hawk assets with MH-53J/M Pave Low IV assets. However, this merger proved to be short-lived and the HC-130P/N and HH-60G CSAR assets were ultimately transferred back to ACC claimancy in 2005. During the temporary assignment of the CSAR mission to AFSOC, the AFRCC remained at Langley AFB. However, on 1 Mar 2006, after the transfer of CSAR assets back to ACC, the AFRCC was put under 1st Air Force/Air Forces North (AFNORTH), the Air Force component command to the new U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) and the ACC's Numbered Air Force for the air defense fighter assets of the Air National Guard. As a result, the AFRCC moved to Tyndall AFB, Florida, where it is now consolidated with the 601st Air Operations Center, giving it greater ability to use Air Force air and space capabilities for search and rescue in the continental United States. The AFNORTH/1AF AOC also gained the responsibility for executing aerial search rescue, and associated personnel recovery operations, for civilian and military aircraft overland in the NORAD-USNORTHCOM area of operations. This resulted in greater efficiencies and capabilities for military personnel and civilians alike. Current Rescue & Guardian Angel Unit Designations The bulk of today's USAF air rescue mission continues to come under the Air Combat Command (ACC). Guardian Angel squadrons consisting of pararescuemen, survival specialists, and combat rescue officers execute all five tasks of personnel recovery: report, locate, support, recover and reintegrate. Enlisted Pararescuemen and commissioned Combat Rescue Officers (CROs) in Guardian Angel recovery teams deploy into uncertain or hostile environments independently or in conjunction with rotary- and fixed-wing aircraft, watercraft, and overland vehicles in order to locate, authenticate, and recover isolated personnel for return to friendly lines. Regular Air Force As of 1 October 2011, operational ACC rescue units are as follows: * 347th Rescue Group, part of the 23d Wing at Moody AFB, Georgia * 563rd Rescue Group, a geographically separated unit of the 23d Wing located at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona The 347 RQG has one HC-130P/N squadron, the 71st Rescue Squadron (71 RQS), one HH-60G squadron, the 41 RQS, and one Guardian Angel Pararescue squadron, the 38 RQS. The 563 RQG has one HC-130P/N squadron, the 79 RQS, two HH-60G squadrons, the 55 RQS at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona and the 66 RQS at Nellis AFB, Nevada, and two Guardian Angel Pararescue squadrons, the 48 RQS at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona and the 58 RQS at Nellis AFB, Nevada. Air-sea rescue and CSAR assets are also assigned to Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), and United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), specifically: * the 18th Wing's 31st Rescue Squadron (pararescue) and 33rd Rescue Squadron (HH-60G) at Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, Japan for PACAF, and * the 48th Fighter Wing's 56th Rescue Squadron (HH-60G) & 57th Rescue Squadron (pararescue) at RAF Lakenheath in the United Kingdom for USAFE. This unit was previously based at the former Naval Air Station Keflavik, Iceland. In this arrangement, the 31 RQS (Pararescue) and 33 RQS (HH-60G) typically provide support throughout the Western Pacific region, while the 56 RQS (HH-60G) & 57th RQS (Pararescue) provide support in Great Britain and Western Europe. Current CSAR aircraft assets in the Active Air Force include the HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopter, the HC-130P/N Hercules \\"Combat King\\" aircraft, and the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II (\\"Warthog\\") attack aircraft. In FY 2008, the A-10s of the 23rd Fighter Group previously based at Pope AFB, North Carolina, relocated back to their previous base of Moody AFB, Georgia where they joined their parent 23rd Wing. In a similar arrangement, the 563 RQG relies on the co-located A-10s of the 355th Fighter Wing at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona. Like their A-1 Skyraider and LTV A-7 Corsair II predecessors, the A-10s, designed for close-air support, continue to use the \\"Sandy\\" call sign and are woven tightly into CSAR operations. When involved in the CSAR mission, A-10s can neutralize enemy threats to friendly survivors on the ground, engaging hostile forces, with their GAU-8 30 mm Gatling gun, which is unique to the A-10 Thunderbolt II. The GAU-8 allows the A-10 to fire on enemy targets with precision in close proximity to friendly forces. A-10s also escort HH-60 helicopters and HC-130s during rescue operations. In addition to ACC A-10 units, other units operating the A-10 in USAFE, PACAF, the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and the Air National Guard (ANG) also routinely exercise and operate with rescue units in the CSAR mission. Air Force Reserve Command Additional CSAR forces also exist in the Air Reserve Component (ARC), composed of both the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and the Air National Guard (ANG). In the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), the ACC-gained 920th Rescue Wing at Patrick AFB, Florida is structured for both CSAR and peacetime SAR, to include principal DoD responsibility for manned spaceflight rescue support to NASA's John F. Kennedy Space Center, as well as Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA), such as those the wing provided in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The 920 RQW's operational capability is centered on the following units at Patrick AFB: * 39th Rescue Squadron (HC-130P/N) * 301st Rescue Squadron (HH-60G), and * 308th Rescue Squadron (Pararescue/Guardian Angel) The 920 RQW also contains additional Geographically Separated Units (GSUs) consisting of the: * 943rd Rescue Group (943 RQG) at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona * 305th Rescue Squadron (HH-60G) at Davis-Monthan AFB * 306th Rescue Squadron (Pararescue/Guardian Angel) at Davis-Monthan AFB, and * 304th Rescue Squadron (Pararescue) at Portland International Airport / Portland Air National Guard Base (formerly Portland Air Reserve Station), Oregon. The 304 RQS also flew the HH-60G as a GSU until its inactivation. Air National Guard In the Air National Guard, the ACC-gained New York Air National Guard's 106th Rescue Wing at Francis S. Gabreski Air National Guard Base (former Suffolk County AFB), New York is structured similar to the Air Force Reserve's 920 RQW. The major difference between these two wings is that in the 106 RQW, all operational capability is centered on a single composite-organized rescue squadron, the 102nd Rescue Squadron (102 RQS), merging HC-130P/N, HH-60G and Pararescue assets into a single squadron. The 102 RQS is also the oldest Air National Guard unit in the United States, tracing its roots back to the 1st Aero Squadron which was formed in New York in 1908. Two additional \\"hybrid\\" rescue units are also present in the Air National Guard. The California Air National Guard's 129th Rescue Wing (129 RQW) is based at Moffett Federal Airfield (former Naval Air Station Moffett Field), California with operational capability centered in the 129 RQS (HH-60G), 130 RQS (HC-130J) and 131 RQS (Pararescue). The Alaska Air National Guard's 176th Wing, a PACAF-gained composite wing formerly located at Kulis Air National Guard Base and now located at Elmendorf AFB, Alaska, also contains both a conventional air-sea rescue and CSAR capability resident in the 210 RQS (HH-60G), 211 RQS (HC-130P/N) and 212 RQS (Pararescue). Among these various remaining CSAR forces, the 23rd Wing is now considered the principal CSAR organization for the U.S. Air Force and carries the heritage and banner of the renowned Flying Tigers, which fought against the Japanese in World War II and earned fame by advancing tactically against Japan's multiple successes early in the war. But while the banner and shield of the old \\"Air Rescue Angel\\" has been committed to Air Force history, the banner is still near and dear in the hearts of all Air Force CSAR personnel, committed to the credo of \\"These things we do, that others may live.\\" Lineage ; 62d Air Force Base Unit * 62d Army Air Forces Base Unit (Search and Rescue Service) organized on 5 December 1945 : 62d Army Air Forces Base Unit redescribed 62d Army Air Forces Base Unit (Search and Rescue) on 23 January 1946 : 62d Army Air Forces Base Unit redescribed 62d Army Air Forces Base Unit (Headquarters, Air Rescue Service) on 23 January 1946 : 62d Army Air Forces Base Unit redesignated 62d Air Force Base Unit (Headquarters, Air Rescue Service) on 26 September 1947 : 62d Air Force Base Unit (Headquarters, Air Rescue Service) discontinued on 3 March 1948 and replaced by Headquarters, Air Rescue Service ; USAF Combat Rescue School * Constituted as Air Rescue Service : Activated on 13 March 1946 : Redesignated Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Service on 8 January 1966 : Redesignated Air Rescue Service on 1 June 1989 : Redesignated USAF Combat Rescue School on 2 July 1993 : Inactivated on 15 July 1995 Assignments * 62d Army Air Forces Base Unit (Search and Rescue Service) assigned to Headquarters, Army Air Forces, 5 December 1945 * Air Transport Command (later Military Air Transport Command, Military Airlift Command), 13 March 1946 * Twenty-Third Air Force, March 1983 * Military Airlift Command, May 1990 * Air Mobility Command 1 June 1992 * Air Combat Command, February 1993 * 57th Wing, 2 July 1993 ‚Äì 15 Jul 1995 Components ; Centers * Aerospace Rescue & Recovery Training Center, 7 February 1969 ‚Äì 30 June 71 * Air Force Rescue Coordination Center, May 1974 ‚Äì c. 1 June 1989, unknown ‚Äì c. 1 March 1993 * Atlantic Air Rescue Center (later Atlantic Aerospace Rescue & Recovery Center, 40th Aerospace Rescue & Recovery Wing), 8 October 1961 ‚Äì 30 June 1973 * Central Air Rescue Center (later Central Aerospace Rescue & Recovery Center), 16 February 1961 ‚Äì 1 January 70 * Eastern Air Rescue Center (later Eastern Aerospace Rescue & Recovery Center), 16 February 1961 ‚Äì 1 January 70 * Pacific Air Rescue Center (later Pacific Aerospace Rescue & Recovery Center, 41st Aerospace Rescue & Recovery Wing, 41st Rescue & Weather Reconnaissance Wing), 8 October 1961 ‚Äì 1 October 1983 * Western Air Rescue Center (later Western Aerospace Rescue & Recovery Center), 16 February 1961 ‚Äì 1 January 1970 ; Wings * 39 Aerospace Rescue & Recovery Wing, 1 January 1970 ‚Äì 1 October 1983 * 40th Aerospace Rescue & Recovery Wing (see Atlantic Air Rescue Center) * 41st Aerospace Rescue & Recovery Wing, 41st Rescue & Weather Reconnaissance Wing (see Pacific Air Rescue Center) ; Groups * 1st Air Rescue Group (see 1st Rescue Squadron) * 2d Air Rescue Group (see 2d Rescue Squadron) * 3d Air Rescue Group (see 3d Rescue Squadron) * 4th Air Rescue Group (see 4th Rescue Squadron) * 5th Air Rescue Group (see 5th Emergency Rescue Squadron) * 6th Air Rescue Group (see 6th Rescue Squadron) * 7th Air Rescue Group (see 7th Rescue Squadron) * 8th Air Rescue Group, 1 April 1954 ‚Äì 30 June 58 * 9th Air Rescue Group (see 9th Air Rescue Squadron) * 10th Air Rescue Group (see 10th Rescue Squadron) * 11th Air Rescue Group (see 11th Air Rescue Squadron) * 12th Air Rescue Group (see 12th Air Rescue Squadron) * 14th Air Rescue Group, 14 May 1953 ‚Äì 15 December 1957 ; Squadrons * Air Rescue Squadron, Provisional, 1, attached 25 January 1963 ‚Äì 1 November 1963 * 1st Rescue Squadron (later 1st Air Rescue Squadron, 1st Air Rescue Group), 1 September 1949 ‚Äì 8 December 1956 (attached to Caribbean Air Command after 14 November 1952) * 2d Rescue Squadron (later 2d Air Rescue Squadron, 2d Air Rescue Group), 1 May 1949 ‚Äì 24 June 1958 (attached to Thirteenth Air Force November 1952 - November 1955, Pacific Air Forces thereafter)Bailey, Carl E.

Cam., (2 September 1707 - 4 August 1777) was an Italian monk and monastic historian. Early life and education Mittarelli was born in 1707 at Venice and christened Nicola Giacomo. At the early age of fourteen, Nicola entered the Camaldolese Order at the Monastery of Saint Michael, established on the island of Murano in the Venetian Lagoon. When he was admitted to the novitiate of the monastery, he was given the name Dom Gian Benedetto, by which he was known for the rest of his life. Later, he studied theology and philosophy at the monasteries of his Order in Florence and Rome. When he completed his studies, he was assigned to teach these subjects to the younger members of the Order. Because he was not attuned to the scholastic method, his superiors sent him to the Monastery of Saint Parisius in Treviso, where he became a confessor and the archivist of the Order. Career In 1760 he was elected Abbot of San Michele, and in 1765, Superior General of his Order for the space of five years during which he resided in Rome. After his term expired, he returned to his monastery in Venice, where he remained as abbot until his death in 1777. Writings His monumental work, in the preparation of which he was assisted by his confr√®res, Dom Anselmo Costadoni and Dom Caloger√†, is the \\"Annales Camaldulenses ordinis S.

True Vipers: Natural History and Toxinology of Old World Vipers. Malabar, Florida: Krieger Publishing Company. 359 pp. . Vipera transcaucasiana is a venomous viper species (regarded by some as a subspecies) endemic to parts of Georgia and northern Turkish Anatolia. Description It grows to a maximum total length (body + tail) of , but is usually not so large. On the head, the rostral scale is wider than it is long, supporting a rostral appendage or \\"horn\\" covered with 9-17 scales arranged in 3 (rarely 2 or 4) transverse rows. On the dorsum, there are two large supraoculars of which the posterior extends beyond the posterior margin of the eye. The rest of the head is covered with small, irregular scales that are either smooth or weakly keeled. There are 7 interocular scale rows. The frontal and parietal plates are usually absent. The nostril is located within a single, large, concave nasal scale that is rarely divided. The nasal is separated from the rostral by a single nasorostral scale. The temporal scales are either smooth or weakly keeled. There are 11-12 circumorbital scales, while two rows separate the eye from the supralabials. There are 9-10 supralabials, of which the 4th and 5th are the largest. Midbody there are 21 rows of strongly keeled dorsal scales, while those bordering the ventrals are either smooth or only weakly keeled. There are 148-160 ventrals, and 32-40 paired subcaudal scales. The anal plate is single. The color pattern consists of a light gray, ash gray, silver gray, pale gray, or grayish white ground color, overlaid with a dorsal pattern of narrow transverse bands. The top of the head and the nasal \\"horn\\" do not have any irregular dark markings, except for a weak V-marking on the back of the head. The iris is golden or coppery. Juveniles have a similar color pattern. Geographic range It is confined to sections of Georgia and northern Turkish Anatolia, according to Nilson et al. (1988). Contrary to some publications, this subspecies does not occur in Armenia, Azerbaijan or Iran. Taxonomy Some elevate V. a. transcaucasiana to species level based on genetic distances that are larger than other full species, such as between V. aspis and V. latastei (Herrmann et al. 1987, 1992).

Burrell is a fictional character on the HBO drama The Wire, played by Frankie Faison. Burrell was an officer in the Baltimore Police Department who ascended from Deputy Commissioner of Operations to Commissioner over the course of the show. He was fired by Mayor Tommy Carcetti for falsifying crime statistics. Biography Burrell is a careerist who believes in the Baltimore Police Department's chain of command and stores knowledge of corrupt activities by his subordinates to maintain his authority. He is a statistical bureaucrat who cares more about reducing crime on paper than building strong cases. Burrell is conscious of the media coverage of the BPD and is very sensitive to the newspaper headlines concerning its progress. Throughout the series, he struggles to direct the BPD to make an adequate impact on crime reduction and constantly engages in conflict with the city's politicians, some of whom blame him for the department's problems. Burrell attended Dunbar High School and was a member of the school's glee club. He was a year ahead of \\"Proposition Joe\\" Stewart, who described Burrell in high school as \\"stone stupid.\\" Season 1 A Deputy Commissioner at the start of season 1, Burrell has ambitions to be promoted to Commissioner, a post held by Warren Frazier. Burrell's primary responsibility is to ensure that Frazier's directives are obeyed throughout the BPD. He consistently shows more interest in making good headlines rather than good cases. When D'Angelo Barksdale beats a murder charge by buying off a witness, Burrell faces criticism from Judge Phelan over the BPD's failure to investigate D'Angelo's uncle Avon. Burrell hastily assembles a task force to placate Phelan, under the command of Lieutenant Cedric Daniels. From the beginning, Burrell is unsupportive of the unit, giving Daniels the worst officers available. He orders premature seizure raids that tip off the Barksdale Organization to the detail's efforts and prompts them to change their operating structure, hindering further investigation. When the detail begins investigating donations from the Barksdale organization to local politicians, Burrell realizes the implications. He is also upset to find that the case is becoming prolonged and that the detail has set up wiretaps. The detail seizes Barksdale money being carried by a driver for corrupt State Senator Clay Davis, but Burrell orders Daniels to return the money in order to avoid embarrassing the senator. Burrell next orders the detail to perform an undercover operation, which ends with the shooting of Detective Kima Greggs. The shooting prompts more involvement from Frazier who, along with Burrell, try to project the image of a strong department to the public by seizing a large amount of narcotics. In retaliation for the shooting, Burrell insists that Daniels' detail raid the Barksdales' main stash house, an act which causes them to stop using payphones -- effectively nullifying the wiretaps. Burrell bribes Detective Ellis Carver with a promotion to sergeant in exchange for information from inside the detail. To force Daniels to meet his demands, Burrell threatens to revisit previous allegations of corruption from Daniels' days in the Eastern District's Drug Enforcement Unit. Daniels calls Burrell's bluff and says he is ready to face the charges and cause bad press. When the Barksdale case ends, Burrell reassigns Daniels to evidence control as punishment for defying him. He also learns about Jimmy McNulty's disclosure of information to Phelan; he approves McNulty's reassignment to the harbor patrol unit as punishment. Season 2 With Frazier's retirement, Burrell is named Acting Commissioner of the BPD. With the support of Mayor Clarence Royce and most of the city's African-American political leaders, Burrell's appointment to Commissioner is made a certainty. Major Stanislaus Valchek, a Southeastern District commander with political connections, offers Burrell support from the dissenting first district in exchange for assembling an investigative detail against Frank Sobotka. Valchek is convinced that Sobotka, the local head of a stevedore union, is smuggling through the docks; he also holds a petty grudge against Sobotka. Burrell gives Valchek six detectives for the new detail, and gives them six weeks to find evidence against Sobotka and the union. However, as Burrell doesn't see any value in the investigation, so he gives Valchek the worst officers available, just as he had with Daniels. Valchek is disappointed with the ineffective detail and furious when he hears through his son-in-law, Detective Roland Pryzbylewski, that Burrell interfered with the Barksdale case. Valchek demands better officers, threatening to derail Burrell's bid for Commissioner; he specifically demands that Daniels lead the detail. Daniels demands a promotion, a specialized unit, and the selection of his own detectives to conduct the Sobotka case. Burrell agrees in order to appease Valchek. Daniels' detail proceeds to build a partially successful case against the union, leaving Valchek mollified. Season 3 Burrell faces problems with councilman Tommy Carcetti, the head of the public safety subcommittee, and criticism of the BPD's failure to reduce crime statistics. He is ordered by Royce to keep the annual murder rate below 275 and cause a 5% decrease in felonies citywide. Royce believes Carcetti will run against him and hopes to insulate himself against opponents by campaigning on declining crime rates. Burrell works with Carcetti in order to prevent the BPD from looking worse at the public safety subcommittee meetings. Carcetti offers Burrell more resources in exchange for inside information about Royce. Burrell accepts the offer. as Royce provides little support to the BPD and forces Burrell to take all the blame for the department's problems. Carcetti continues to criticize the BPD over issues like witness protection but delivers on his promises to Burrell, who comes to see the councilman as an ally. Burrell promotes Major William Rawls to fill his old position of Deputy Commissioner of Operations, but fails to deliver Daniels his promised promotion due to political conflicts involving Daniels' wife Marla, who is running for a council seat against Royce loyalist Eunetta Perkins. Burrell does allow Daniels his own Major Crimes Unit and they return to investigating Avon Barksdale. Meanwhile, Burrell and Rawls preside over weekly COMSTAT meetings where they pressure BPD district commanders to return the favorable crime rate figures that are demanded by Royce. Burrell relieves Major Marvin Taylor as Eastern District Commander and threatened Western District Commander Major Howard \\"Bunny\\" Colvin when felonies rise 2% in his district. Colvin responds by allowing drug dealing to continue unchecked in specific areas, causing the felony rate drops. Colvin conceals his strategy from his superiors and they become suspicious of his statistics. Upon learning the truth about Colvin's success, Burrell forces Colvin to take his vacation time immediately and informs Royce of the sanctioned drug dealing zones. Royce considers sustaining the initiative because of its positive effects. When Royce shows signs of blaming the department, Burrell threatens to go to the press and blame City Hall for the potential fiasco. Burrell then softens his tone with an offer to take full responsibility for Colvin's actions provided that Royce makes him Commissioner for a full term. Burrell leaks the story to Carcetti, and the massive media attention forces Royce to accept Burrell's offer. Burrell has Rawls shut down Colvin's drug-tolerant zones soon after Royce caves to his demands. He also demotes Colvin to Lieutenant and forces him to retire early with the assistance of Internal Investigations Division commander Major Bobby Reed. Colvin complies with Burrell's demands because Burrell threatens to involve the men under Colvin's command. Burrell humiliates Colvin further by informing Johns Hopkins University of his misdeeds and costing him his retirement job with Campus Security. Elsewhere, Daniels' Major Crimes Unit arrests Avon Barksdale just as the Colvin scandal hits, allowing Burrell to further divert media attention. Following the arrest, Burrell gives Daniels his promotion to Major, and Daniels takes Colvin's post as commander of the Western District. Season 4 Burrell is a key member of Royce's inner circle. Royce is outraged when the MCU begins serving subpoenas against key political figures without his knowledge. After a dressing down from Royce, Burrell promises to prevent any more surprises from his department. Burrell and Rawls agree to control the subpoenas by \\"proper supervision\\" of the MCU. This involves removing the lenient Lieutenant Jimmy Asher and replacing him with the hostile Lieutenant Charles Marimow. After Burrell fails to bring a murdered witness to Royce's attention before it becomes a campaign issue, the Mayor orders Burrell to downplay the story to the press and take the political fallout on himself. Royce also instructs Burrell to slow the investigation down until after the election to prevent it being proved that the victim was a protected witness. Burrell orders Foerster to assign Greggs, now a rookie homicide detective, to the case. When the change in investigators is leaked to the press, Royce reprimands Burrell and implies to Rawls that he will be made Commissioner after the Mayor wins the Democratic primary. However, Royce loses to Carcetti, allowing Burrell to keep his job. When Carcetti asks Burrell to resign, he tells the new Mayor that he would have to fire him and would not go quietly. Unable to find a suitable African-American replacement for Commissioner, Carcetti decides to strip Burrell of his power and give all decision making to Rawls, while leaving Burrell as a figurehead for the press and ministers. Burrell gets concerned when Carcetti orders the promotion of Daniels to Colonel and Criminal Investigations Division commander. Burrell is afraid that Carcetti plans to make Daniels his replacement. With Daniels' promotion from Major to Colonel after only a short time as Major, Burrell's future in the department becomes bleak. Burrell proves himself a valuable political aide to Carcetti in the handling of racial profiling allegations against Herc, tricked by Bubbles into stopping a car driven by a black minister. He recommends the IID look deep into Herc's file because his time in Narcotics would probably show further poor conduct. Burrell also meets with Davis to discuss preventing Daniels from advancing further in the BPD, discussing Burrell's possession of FBI information regarding Daniels' unexplained income in the Eastern District. Burrell warns Rawls never to cross him again, as Rawls' own hopes for promotion have been dashed by the political climate. Season 5 More than a year into Carcetti's term, Burrell is forced to deal with massive budget cuts despite the Mayor's pledge to improve funding for the BPD. However, he successfully convinces Carcetti to lift the cap on secondary employment in order to bolster morale. Meanwhile, Davis faces a corruption investigation by the MCU, and appeals to Burrell for protection. Burrell is unable to do so, as Daniels commands both the MCU and the CID and is linked with Carcetti. Davis angrily threatens Burrell. Valchek leaks increased crime statistics to Carcetti, hoping to usurp Burrell's position. However, Carcetti decides to accept rising crime as a consequence of his budget cuts. However, Burrell delivers altered statistics to Carcetti, despite the Mayor's insistence on clean numbers. Carcetti finally has the political capital he needs to fire Burrell and leaks a story about a potential shake up in the BPD. Burrell is devastated when he reads the story, which relates that Carcetti will promote Rawls to temporary Acting Commissioner while Daniels is groomed for Deputy Commissioner. Burrell plans to expose Daniels' alleged corruption, but is talked into leaving quietly by city council president Nerese Campbell with the promise of a lucrative replacement position. Burrell agrees to attend a press conference with Carcetti and to allow the transitions to go ahead in order to secure his new job. In a rare humanizing moment when facing his departure, Burrell reveals his bitterness at having to accommodate interference and policy-making from City Hall throughout his career. He warns Rawls that he could expect the same treatment.

These cells differentiate into xylem tissue. Unlike the more common bifacial cambium found in later woody plants, the unifacial cambium does not produce phloem to its exterior. Also in contrast to the bifacial cambium, the unifacial cambium is unable to expand its circumference with anticlinal cell division. Cell elongation provides a limited amount of expansion.  Unifacial cambium plant morphology and life cycles  The unifacial cambium allowed plants to grow as tall as 50 metres. Lacking secondary phloem, unifacial cambium plants developed alternative strategies to long range nutrient transport. For example, the stems of lycophyte trees were covered in photosynthesizing leaf bases. Due to the limited capacity for circumference growth, unifacial cambium plants had very little wood compared to modern woody plants. Xylem tissue in unifacial cambium plants was particularly structurally efficient. Additional structural support was provided in lycophytes by a special periderm tissue in the outer cortex. Lycophyte trees exhibit determinate growth. These trees appear to have lived for most of their life cycle as a 'stump', establishing root networks underground, before shooting up rapidly, releasing spores, and dying shortly thereafter.

The organization was founded in 2008 as a result of a national conference called on behalf of the Alliance of Concerned Jewish Canadians. IJV promotes the expression of alternative Jewish voices, particularly in respect of the grave situation in the Middle East, which threatens the future of both Israelis and Palestinians as well as the stability of the whole region. It is guided by the following Basis of Unity: # Human rights are universal and indivisible and should be upheld without exception. This is as applicable in Israel and Occupied Palestine as it is elsewhere. # Palestinians and Israelis alike have the right to peaceful and secure lives. # Peace and stability require the willingness of all parties to the conflict to comply with international law. # There is no justification for any form of racism, including anti-Semitism, anti-Arab racism or Islamophobia in any circumstance. # The battle against anti-Semitism is vital and is undermined whenever opposition to Israeli government policies is automatically branded as anti-Semitic Positions IJV asks that Israeli policies comply with international law and follow international conventions on human rights. This includes withdrawing from land Israel occupied after the Six-Day War in 1967, respecting the universal right of refugees to return to their homes or receive compensation, dismantling the Separation Wall and Israeli settlements on the West Bank and Golan Heights, and correcting laws and practices within Israel that discriminate against the rights of non-Jews. IJV has not adopted a position on the question of a one-state versus a two-state solution, but believes it is crucial for Israelis and Palestinians to have fully equal rights in any solution. Criticism of the Canadian Jewish Congress IJV has been highly critical of the Canadian Jewish Congress (CJC), now reorganized as the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA). In an interview with the Kelowna Daily Courier, Sid Shniad of IJV accused the CJC of \\"playing the anti-Semitic card ... because they don't have a lot else. They want to intimidate; they want to shut (the debate) down. They want people to avert their eyes when it comes to the ongoing crisis there to allow them to do what they have been doing.\\" He further added that the CJC is \\"playing a losing game. They're placing themselves on the wrong side of the issue of free speech. It can't be won. You don't win people's hearts and minds by telling them to shut up and go away.\\" He also stated that it was \\"outrageous\\" that Bernie Farber, CEO of the CJC, attended a conference of the United Church of Canada (UCC) \\"to try to shut down this debate\\".Church braces for debate by J.P. Squire, Kelowna Daily Courier, August 10, 2009. Conversely, the Canadian Jewish Congress has often criticized IJV. Bernie Farber, chief executive of the CJC, stated that \\"no one ever says Israel is perfect\\" and predicted the fledgling group will have trouble finding support. Farber stated that the alliance \\"will remain a rump on the edge of Jewish society.\\" In January 2010, Farber described IJV as a \\"fringe group\\" that spews \\"vile, anti-Zionist\\" rhetoric.United Church, Jewish group try to reconcile by Kathryn Blaze Carlson, National Post, Friday, January 29, 2010. Criticism of Canadian government In 2010, Canada's bid for a seat on the UN Security Council failed and Prime Minister Stephen Harper blamed it on \\"a rising tide of antisemitism\\". Diana Ralph of IJV denied that the criticism of Israeli policies was anti-Semitic and stated, \\"We believe that it is legitimate and ethically necessary for Canadians of conscience to criticize Israeli human rights abuses and to support non-violent remedies.\\"Anti-Semitism on the Rise Here and Abroad, PM Says The Star (Canada) 8 November 2010, accessed 11 November 2010 In response, Melanie Phillips, writing in The Spectator, described Independent Jewish Voices as \\"...those obnoxious Finklers ... part of that broader coalition of hatred which should surely be called Jews for Injustice Against Jews\\".Melanie Phillips, Jews for Injustice against Jews , The Spectator, 9 November 2010, accessed 11 November 2010 IJV opposed the appointment of Vivian Bercovici as Canadian ambassador to Israel in 2014, calling her an \\"apologist for Israel's crimes\\". Other IJV has also spoken out against Canadian Hillel chapters denying members the right to hold open discussions of Israel. In May 2014, IJV called on the Canadian government to deny entry of Moshe Feiglin, Deputy Minister of the Israeli Knesset, because of his allegedly racist views. According to IJV spokesperson Sheryl Nestel, these include \\"support for the transfer to neighbouring Arab states of the 1.4 million Palestinians who are citizens of Israel. Feiglin is also an advocate of annexing the West Bank and the Gaza strip and of the exercise of full Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem, both of which are in direct contravention of international law.\\" Activism Support for BDS In June 2009, IJV became the first Canadian Jewish organization to join an international campaign in support of the call for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) against Israel. IJV stated that it will: IJV has promoted the boycott of SodaStream, a company selling water carbonation devices manufactured in the occupied West Bank. In 2012, the United Church of Canada decided to boycott goods produced in illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The Church was accused of bias and anti-Semitism. IJV spokesperson Tyler Levitan defended the Church's campaign in a public statement, saying that \\"The Israel lobby, unable to defend Israel's occupation and brutal treatment of the Palestinian people, can only slur those who support Palestinian human rights.\\" In 2014, IJV widened its BDS initiatives to include Block the Boat, a campaign to cause financial loss to the Israeli Zim Integrated Shipping Services company by blocking its ships from unloading. Countering pro-Israel advocacy In an article written for the Winnipeg Free Press and reprinted widely since, IJV member Jason Kunin wrote that \\"pro- Israel advocacy depends upon on the active dissemination of Islamophobia. Not surprisingly, engendering hatred in this manner inflames anti-Jewish sentiment among Arabs and Muslims. None of this is a recipe for making Jews safe\\" and that \\"Defenders of Israel often argue that Israel is forced to do what it does ‚Äî to destroy people's homes, to keep them under the boot of occupation, to seal them into walled ghettos, to brutalize them daily with military incursions and random checkpoints ‚Äî to protect its citizens from Palestinian violence.\\" In an interview with the Ryerson Free Press in July 2009, then IJV co-chair Diana Ralph expressed confidence that \\"progressive Jews in alliance with other pro-justice groups had the potential to build a movement powerful enough to expose, weaken and eventually defeat the Canadian Israel lobby.\\" Ralph also claimed that \\"in spite of heavy pro-Israel propaganda, most Jews are far more progressive than the Israel lobby which claims to speak for them.\\"Jewish group embraces boycott, makes history , Ryerson Free Press, July 16, 2009. 2008‚Äì09 and 2014 Gaza wars IJV opposed the Gaza War of 2008‚Äì09.

IJV was again moved to outrage and action in 2014 by the Israeli bombing and invasion of Gaza, and what they saw as the support of Israel's actions by Stephen Harper and other national parties. \\"The Liberal party is in lockstep with the Conservatives in not even mentioning Palestinian casualties and the NDP won't mention the word Palestine\\", said Tyler Levitan of IJV. IJV organized and joined protests across Canada. Opposition to the Jewish National Fund IJV has criticized the Jewish National Fund (JNF) for \\"discriminatory policies of ethnic exclusion, and its role in the historic and ongoing dispossession of Palestinians from their lands.\\" IJV has mounted a campaign in conjunction with other organizations to have the charitable status of the JNF's Canadian branch revoked. Members of IJV and others disrupted an event put on by JNF Canada in Toronto in September 2014. History First national conference The Alliance of Concerned Jewish Canadians and other activists held a national Independent Jewish Canadians Conference on March 28‚Äì30, 2008 with Naomi Klein as its keynote speaker. The participants affirmed their support for international law, their opposition to all forms or racism (including anti- Semitism and Islamophobia), and pledged to counter the view that any criticism of Israel's government and military policies is automatically anti-Semitic. Specifically, they opposed the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza which commenced in 1967.http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/July2007/03/c3437.html The conference passed a resolution creating an interim steering committee that would found a national progressive Jewish organization. The steering committee adopted the name Independent Jewish Voices (Canada) shortly afterwards. ACJC co-founder Eibie Weizfeld split with the new group and continues to lead an organization called ACJC which is unconnected with IJV. The seven stated goals of IJV are: # To give Jewish Canadians an alternative that works for peace and justice # To challenge the Jewish establishment's views on the Middle East # To open up discussion about Israeli government and military actions # To support the right of Canadians to discuss Israeli policies without fear of being accused of anti-Semitism # To promote contacts with Muslims and Arabs in Canada and to demonstrate that we can work together for peace # To oppose wars of aggression # To work in solidarity with the peace movements and war resisters within Israelhttp://www.nion.ca/pdf/acjc-conference-callout.pdf Controversies In 2009, a minor controversy ensued when the National Post publicized former IJV co-ordinator Diana Ralph's contribution of a chapter to The Hidden History of 9-11,Paul Zermebka (2006). The hidden history of 9-11-2001. Elsevier JAI. in which she wrote that the attacks of September 11, 2001 were being used by the United States government as a pretext to \\"seize control of Eurasia, and thereby the entire world.\\" She also wrote that \\"It is difficult to draw another conclusion than that Bush's associates organized the 9/11 attacks to kick-start popular support for this war\\" and that \\"The 'war on terror' is a concept modelled on Israel's assaults on Palestinians to provide a cover for campaigns of territorial conquest.\\"United Church vows more care in funding by Kathryn Blaze Carlson, National Post, September 22, 2009. Howard Davidson, a member of the IJV steering committee, stated that Ralph's past has \\"nothing to do with the IJV\\" and that \\"The positions of Diana Ralph stated in those articles do not represent the positions of the IJV.\\" Shortly after the National Post article, Ralph stepped down as IJV's co-ordinator. She wrote a rebuttal to the allegations directed at her. In February 2015, IJV linked to an article by anti-Zionist writer Alan Hart on its official Facebook and Twitter accounts. The link was to a version of the article that had been reposted on the far-right website Veterans Today, with an editor's note that contested the numbers of Jews that were killed in the Holocaust. B'nai Brith Canada accused IJV of thereby promoting Holocaust denial. IJV apologized, condemning the charge of Holocaust denial, and writing that they had been careless in not examining the editor's note and the Veterans Today website.

The parish had a population of 1,167 at the 2001 census, increasing to 1,486 at the 2011 Census. History Holme was originally a minor settlement in the parish of Burton-in-Kendal. It expanded following the completion of the Lancaster Canal in 1819, which provided a transport link for the mill at Holme Mills. The parish church of the Holy Trinity was built in 1839 to support the growing population, and the former school, now the parish hall, opened in 1840. The school was replaced in 1911 by a larger building on North Road, which still survives as Holme Primary School. Geography Historically within the county of Westmorland, the village lies adjacent to the Lancaster Canal, West Coast Main Line and M6 motorway, which run close together to take advantage of the local topography. Governance An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward stretches beyond the confines of Holme parish with at total population at the 2011 Census of 1,728. Community Amenities include a general store, a post office/newsagent, a village social club and a public house called \\"The Smithy Inn\\". There is an hourly bus service to the nearby towns of Carnforth and Lancaster, to the south; and Kendal, to the north, operated by Stagecoach North West. Holme Park Quarry is a small quarry to the east of the village, operated by Bardon Aggregates. Also on site is a premix concrete plant. The neighbourhood of Holme Mills, on the southern edge of the village, is centred on the 19th century jute mill of the same name. The mill buildings are now part of Holme Mills Industrial Estate, which houses a number of small businesses.

They contain micro-fabricated point-contact hydrogen sensors and are used to locate hydrogen leaks. They are considered low-cost, compact, durable, and easy to maintain as compared to conventional gas detecting instruments. Key issues There are five key issues with hydrogen detectors: * Reliability: Functionality should be easily verifiable. * Performance: Detection 0.5% hydrogen in air or better * Response time < 1 second. * Lifetime: At least the time between scheduled maintenance. * Cost: Goal is $5 per sensor and $30 per controller. Additional requirements * Measurement range coverage of 0.1‚Äì10.0% concentrationNREL-Hydrogen Sensor Testing oct 2008 * Operation in temperatures of ‚àí30 ¬∞C to 80 ¬∞C * Accuracy within 5% of full scale * Function in an ambient air gas environment within a 10‚Äì98% relative humidity range * Resistance to hydrocarbon and other interference. * Lifetime greater than 10 years Types of microsensors There are various types of hydrogen microsensors, which use different mechanisms to detect the gas. Palladium is used in many of these, because it selectively absorbs hydrogen gas and forms the compound palladium hydride. Palladium-based sensors have a strong temperature dependence which makes their response time too large at very low temperatures. Palladium sensors have to be protected against carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. Optical fibre hydrogen sensors Several types of optical fibre surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor are used for the point-contact detection of hydrogen: *Fiber Bragg grating coated with a palladium layer ‚Äì Detects the hydrogen by metal hindrance. *Micromirror ‚Äì With a palladium thin layer at the cleaved end, detecting changes in the backreflected light. *Tapered fibre coated with palladium ‚Äì Hydrogen changes the refractive index of the palladium, and consequently the amount of losses in the evanescent wave. Other types *Electrochemical hydrogen sensor ‚Äì low (ppm) levels of hydrogen gas can be sensed using electrochemical sensors which comprise an array of electrodes packaged so as to be surrounded by a conductive electrolyte and gas ingress controlled with a diffusion limited capillary. *MEMS hydrogen sensor ‚Äì The combination of nanotechnology and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology allows the production of a hydrogen microsensor that functions properly at room temperature. One type of MEMS-based hydrogen sensor is coated with a film consisting of nanostructured indium oxide (In2O3) and tin oxide (SnO2). A typical configuration for mechanical Pd-based hydrogen sensors is the usage of a free-standing cantilever that is coated with Pd. In the presence of H2, the Pd layer expands and thereby induces a stress that causes the cantilever to bend. Pd-coated nanomechanical resonators have also been reported in literature, relying on the stress-induced mechanical resonance frequency shift caused by the presence of H2 gas. In this case, the response speed was enhanced through the use of a very thin layer of Pd (20 nm). Moderate heating was presented as a solution to the response impairment observed in humid conditions. *Thin film sensor ‚Äì A palladium thin film sensor is based on an opposing property that depends on the nanoscale structures within the thin film. In the thin film, nanosized palladium particles swell when the hydride is formed, and in the process of expanding, some of them form new electrical connections with their neighbors. The resistance decreases because of the increased number of conducting pathways. *Thick film sensors ‚Äì devices usually having two principal components:1) a thick (hundreds of microns) layer of some semiconductor material (SnO2, In2O3), called \\"matrix\\" and an upper layer of catalytically active additives like noble metals (Pd, Pt) and metal oxides (CoxOy) accelerating the hydrogen oxidation reaction on the surface, which makes the sensor response much faster. The role of \\"matrix\\" is to transduce the signal to the measurement system. Thick film sensors are more stable than thin film sensors in terms of signal drifting, but generally exhibit slower sensor response due to diffusion constraints into a thick layer. Thick film sensor technology is getting substituted by thin film approaches due to the increasing need for sensor integration into modern electronic systems. Thick film sensors require increased temperatures for their operation and therefore appear to be poorly compatible with digital electronics systems. *Chemochromic hydrogen sensors ‚Äì Reversible and irreversible chemochromic hydrogen sensors include a smart pigment paint that visually identifies hydrogen leaks by a change in color. The sensor is also available as tape. Other methods have been developed to assay biological hydrogen production. *Diode based Schottky sensor ‚Äì A Schottky diode-based hydrogen gas sensor employs a palladium-alloy gate. Hydrogen can be selectively absorbed in the gate, lowering the Schottky energy barrier. A Pd/InGaP metal-semiconductor (MS) Schottky diode can detect a concentration of 15 parts per million (ppm) H2 in air. Silicon carbide semiconductor or silicon substrates are used. *Metallic La-Mg2-Ni which is electrical conductive, absorbs hydrogen near ambient conditions, forming the nonmetallic hydride LaMg2NiH7 an insulator. Sensors are typically calibrated at the manufacturing factory and are valid for the service life of the unit. Enhancement Siloxane enhances the sensitivity and reaction time of hydrogen sensors. Detection of hydrogen levels as low as 25 ppm can be achieved; far below hydrogen's lower explosive limit of around 40,000 ppm.

Over the course of the series, Rawls ascends through the higher ranks of the Baltimore Police Department, eventually becoming Deputy Commissioner of Operations and, at the end of Season 5, Superintendent of the Maryland State Police. His careerism and deft political manoeuvring are generally portrayed as detrimental to the department and the work of officers under his command; seen, for example, in his regular attempts to offload difficult case-work to other divisions or departments, or shut down investigations in order to keep 'stats' down. When Rawls is promoted to Deputy Commissioner, he is put in charge of the weekly ComStat meetings, a platform which he uses to bully and berate the commanders under his authority. He is a 'no-nonsense' leader who obstinately refuses to allow anything that might harm his career, regardless of benefit to the department. Little is disclosed of Rawls' personal life aside from incidental allusions to his sexuality, wife and children. Biography Season 1 Rawls is a major and commanding officer of the Homicide Unit in Season 1. He is only concerned with maintaining the case clearance record of his unit, and is extremely demanding of his detectives. He is upset when Jimmy McNulty bypasses him to Judge Phelan to encourage further investigation of the Barksdale Organization. At the request for manpower and instruction of Deputy Commissioner Ervin Burrell, Rawls sends McNulty and Michael Santangelo to Lt. Cedric Daniels' Barksdale detail as they are the two \\"humps\\" he no longer wants. Santangelo is used as Rawls' inside man in the Barksdale detail. Rawls relies upon Sergeant Jay Landsman to handle much of his communication with the men under his command in homicide. McNulty placates Rawls by working several old murder cases, linking them all to the same gun and to D'Angelo Barksdale. Rawls wants to immediately issue a warrant for D'Angelo, but McNulty is wary since arresting D'Angelo would be premature and will tip off his uncle Avon to their investigation. The detail persuades Daniels to fight Rawls' push for arrests. Eventually, Daniels goes over Rawls' head and meets with Burrell, convincing him to put the warrants on hold. An infuriated Rawls demands that Santangelo either clear a case by day's end, inform on McNulty, or leave the unit altogether due to his low clearance rate. McNulty and Bunk Moreland save Santangelo's skin by clearing one of his open cases while sending him on a trip to a phony gypsy named \\"Madame LaRue\\". Following the shooting of Detective Kima Greggs in a buy bust gone wrong, Rawls becomes personally involved in the investigation. His first action is to order all non-essential personnel, including Greggs' friends in her detail, to disperse from the crime scene. He later speaks to a distraught McNulty and while he again expresses his hatred for his subordinate, he reassures him that he was not ultimately responsible for the shooting. When McNulty convinces Daniels to go around his superiors and try to involve the FBI in the Barksdale case, Rawls reassigns McNulty to the BPD's marine unit. Rawls has Detective Lester Freamon replace McNulty, and transfers Santangelo to the Western District as a beat officer. Season 2 Rawls gets promoted to colonel, partly on the basis of McNulty's work on the Barksdale case. When McNulty comes across a floater while on marine patrol, Rawls manages to convince the neighboring Baltimore County Police Department that the case belongs to them. McNulty uses wind and tide charts to prove that the death occurred in Rawls' jurisdiction. When thirteen dead women turn up in a cargo container at the ports, Rawls again tries to avoid responsibility for the investigation, and McNulty again finds proof that the deaths fell under Rawls' jurisdiction. Rawls has Sergeant Jay Landsman assign the case to Freamon and Bunk because he believes they are the best investigators in his squad. When Daniels' detail is re-formed to investigate stevedore union leader Frank Sobotka, Rawls signs off on every officer Daniels wants from his original Barksdale detail, with the exception of McNulty. Rawls pressures Daniels to investigate the fourteen murders; Daniels initially refuses in order to keep the case simple, but later accepts due to persuasion from Freamon. In exchange, he extracts a promise from Rawls to give him whatever he needs to solve the murders. When Daniels demands McNulty, Rawls is ultimately forced to pull him out of marine patrol and return him to Daniels' unit. Rawls thus allows McNulty to be Daniels' responsibility, but will not let him any further back into the Homicide Unit. The fourteen murder cases prove to be a boon for Rawls, as all of them are cleared by Daniels' team at the end of season two. Season 3 With Burrell's promotion to Commissioner, Rawls is promoted to Deputy Commissioner of Operations in his place. During weekly ComStat meetings with the BPD's district commanders, Rawls relentlessly interrogates them about how they are dealing with crime rates in their respective jurisdictions. While Rawls berates several shift commanders over the season, he commends others like Daniels on a number of occasions as the type of commander he sees as both dedicated and competent. When Lamar is sent by Brother Mouzone into a gay bar to search for Omar Little, Rawls is shown briefly in the background. He is out of uniform and holding a drink. He has a smile on his face and appears to be at ease in the environment. This suggests that Rawls is possibly gay or bisexual, though likely closeted, as he is married with a family, and disclosure of such information could be detrimental to his career. When Colvin reveals Hamsterdam to his colleagues and superiors during a CompStat meeting Rawls publicly berates Colvin, but confides in the following meeting with Colvin and Burrell that while it is \\"insane and illegal\\", it is \\"brilliant\\". During the shutdown of Hamsterdam, Rawls personally orders the mobilization of the Quick Response Team (QRT) and drives into the thick of it with his car radio playing Richard Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries, an allusion to the renowned helicopter scene from the film Apocalypse Now. This goes against Colvin's wish that no mass arrests would take place and also denies Daniels a QRT unit for the take-down of the Barksdale organization. Season 4 Rawls is Burrell's first port of call when subpoenas issued by the Major Crimes Unit upset State Senator Clay Davis and Mayor Clarence Royce. Rawls suggests that Freamon is the most likely source of the problem and recommends that the unit get proper supervision. Rawls thus transfers a hostile lieutenant named Charles Marimow to head the MCU. Marimow's caustic leadership results in an immediate shutdown of the unit's drug-money tracing activities and a return to street level investigations. Rawls preempts a rebellion from Freamon by threatening his colleagues and offering him a transfer back to Homicide. Rawls also facilitates the move of Greggs from the MCU to Homicide as a favor for Daniels. Rawls displays his great political acumen when Burrell makes the mistake of assigning Greggs to the politically sensitive murder of a state's witness to slow the investigation down on Royce's behalf. He allows Burrell's plan to go ahead and, when it is leaked to the press, Burrell falls out of Royce's favor. Rawls tells Royce that he did not act differently as he is a loyal subordinate who always follows his boss's orders. Looking to replace Burrell, Royce asks Rawls if he is ready to take command in the wake of Burrell's mistake, through telling Rawls that if he fixes this situation, Royce will keep his actions on hand. Rawls also endears himself to Tommy Carcetti's campaign for mayor. He receives word from a contact in Royce's security detail that the mayor has fallen out with State Delegate Odell Watkins. Rawls feeds this information to Carcetti so that he can recruit Watkins's support, and asks Carcetti to remember him if he is elected. Rawls then assures the election goes smoothly by interfering with the dead state's witness case, reassigning Ed Norris and Greggs to election duty for the day as the department is 20 officers short of duty. Carcetti is elected mayor and begins trying to make the department more productive. He observes the department and work and sees an unmotivated investigation unit and petty drug arrests and then comes to Rawls. When Carcetti asks Rawls about the problems in the department, Rawls claims that affirmative action and pressure from the mayor's office has made policing a numbers' game. He states that to appease the voters and have a department that is demographically a match to that of the city, a 20% hike in the number of African American officers is required. He says this has occurred up the chain of command as well as in the academy and the early promotions have put inexperienced officers who are more trained to handle statistical values than they are to set out good policing strategies in command positions. Rawls claims that if it were up to him, he would focus on high end drug enforcement, a claim that Daniels (an African American commander who Rawls does view as \\"good police\\") does not believe. Despite being a loyal subordinate, Rawls develops a power struggle with Burrell over who controls the activity in the Department. Rawls is commanded to control day-to-day activity by Carcetti. Carcetti has no faith in Burrell's capacity to change the department's problems. Burrell is threatened by Rawls, allowing the promotion of Daniels from Major to Colonel at the Mayor's request. Daniels is the most apparent threat within the department to dethroning Burrell as Commissioner. Rawls does not realize that Daniels could be promoted ahead of him until Valchek points out the hindrance of Rawls' Caucasian race, specifically due to Baltimore's African American majority and the fact that the black community will only accept a white Commissioner if there is a black Mayor, or vice versa. The political irony of season 4 is that Rawls helped Carcetti beat Royce in the election with the Watkins information, when it's likely that Rawls would have been named Commissioner if Royce had been reelected. Season 5 Rawls continues to serve as Deputy Commissioner for Operations and begins to work amiably with Commissioner Ervin Burrell again. Mayor Tommy Carcetti puts the department under severe strain by cutting their funding and failing to deliver on his promises to initiate change. Rawls has to deal with extremely low morale amongst all officers and is still expected to deliver a reduction in the crime rate by Carcetti. Rawls and Burrell continue to manipulate their statistics. The altered statistics are discovered by Carcetti giving him the political ammunition he has been waiting for to fire Burrell. Carcetti plans to move Rawls to acting commissioner while he prepares Cedric Daniels to take over the post permanently. The transitions in the police department were officially announced at a press conference attended by Carcetti, Burrell, Rawls and Daniels. In the series finale, Rawls is seen being sworn in as the Superintendent of the Maryland State Police as a reward for his loyalty to Carcetti and his allowing Valchek to become commissioner. Origins Rawls' distinctive manner of intimidating subordinates is based on real-life Baltimore CID commander Joe Cooke. Simon has also commented that Rawls' attitude towards the murder rate and his unit's clearance record is a product of the extreme pressure he is under.

Howard \\"Bunny\\" Colvin is a fictional character on the HBO drama The Wire, played by actor Robert Wisdom. Colvin is a wise and able police major in the Baltimore's Western District, alienated by the careerism and bureaucracy rampant in Baltimore Police Department and detrimental social effects of the War on Drugs. Close to retirement, he secretly breaks chain of command and puts his resources into \\"Hamsterdam,\\" three zones within his district where drug dealing is pressured to non-violently conglomerate in exchange for informal legal sanction. Colvin also concentrates policing in these areas and attracts important ground-level social services, such as needle and condom distribution. Despite unprecedented statistical gains, Colvin is forced to retire from the force. He later becomes a field researcher alongside academic Dr. David Parenti in Baltimore city schools. In this role, Colvin falls into the guardianship of Namond Brice.  Character storyline Colvin joined the Baltimore Police Department in 1973, patrolling his home neighborhood in Baltimore's Western District. Over his tenure, he advanced to the rank of district commander in the Western. Colvin's philosophy of policing involves protecting the community he serves by making quality arrests through the use of trusted informants on his foot post. As a commander, he insists that his men learn their foot post and urges them to focus on doing real police work. Toward the end of his career, he begins seeing the War on Drugs as an ineffective waste of time and resources that has led to many needless casualties in his district.  Season two  Colvin is at the scene when a child is accidentally shot during a turf war, appalled at the senselessness of the killing. When ordered to crack down on the area, his second in command, Dennis Mello, states that they waited too long to make the arrests they had. Colvin begins to question what it is they are really doing on their job.  Season three  Colvin, months away from being eligible to retire on a major's pension, decides to make a last effort to have a real impact on the community. He recognizes that much of his time and resources are spent on policing addicts and low level dealers, which never improves the situation in his district and leaves little time for \\"real\\" police work. All of Baltimore's district majors are under extreme pressure to reduce the city's violent crime rate from Mayor Clarence Royce, who is seeking re-election. After Commissioner Ervin Burrell relieves Major Marvin Taylor from his post commanding the Eastern District due to his poor performance, other district commanders begin \\"juking\\" their stats to make crime rates appear to drop. Colvin refuses to do this, and his stats honestly reflect a 2% rise in felonies. He is quickly chewed out by Deputy Commissioner William Rawls, while Burrell threatens to have him replaced. Colvin wonders if there is a way for low-level users to take drugs safely without facing punishment. After the attempted murder of Kenneth Dozerman, Colvin decides that he will independently set up three \\"free zones\\" in the Western where addicts and dealers can conduct their business under supervision, but without interference. This moves the drug trade into a controlled, uninhabited area to protect the rest of his district. Colvin does not seek the permission or approval of his superiors before implementing his plan, and ignores the concerns of his subordinates, including Mello and Ellis Carver, who are charged with ensuring no violence takes place within the free zones. One of these areas becomes known as \\"Hamsterdam\\", after Amsterdam's liberal drug laws. Because his retirement is imminent and he is guaranteed a pension, Colvin believes he'll be free from any consequences should his plan be discovered. Legalizing drugs in Hamsterdam allows him to redirect police resources to quality felony cases elsewhere. After implementing the Hamsterdam plan for five weeks, Colvin delivers a cumulative 14% reduction in the felony rate, unheard of in the Western's history. Colvin is forced to take his vacation time immediately after revealing his experiment to Rawls and Burrell. Royce considers trying to spin Hamsterdam as an enforcement strategy because of its success in lowering the crime rate. However, in the meantime, Herc leaks information about Hamsterdam to the press after rejecting Carver's request to help him move a homicide victim off the free zone premises. After realizing that public opinion is sharply against the free zones, and that there are broader political ramifications, Royce recants and decides to end the Hamsterdam experiment. Burrell and Rawls force Colvin into becoming a scapegoat by threatening to persecute his officers. He is demoted to lieutenant and thus gets a lowered pension. Burrell also contacts Johns Hopkins University and convinces them to withdraw a job offer for their campus security force. As a commanding officer, Colvin is well liked by his men. Colvin has a major impact on Carver, convincing him to reassess his role as DEU sergeant and to take a more community-minded approach to policing. He also reconnects with Jimmy McNulty, who had started out as a beat officer under his command. Colvin's last piece of detective work involves McNulty's Major Case Unit: Stringer Bell contacts Colvin to inform on Avon Barksdale, and Colvin passes the information on to McNulty. In Colvin, Stringer sees a fellow reformer who feels his superiors are preventing useful work from being done. As Bell puts it, they are \\"both trying to make sense of this game,\\" though from opposite sides of the law.  Season four  Colvin attempts to supplement his diminished pension by working as the head of security for a downtown hotel. He becomes disillusioned with the post when the hotel manager refuses to let him arrest a wealthy client who had assaulted a prostitute in his hotel room, and quits the job soon thereafter. Later, he is approached with another job from The Deacon, who has learned of a large grant to the University of Maryland to look at repeat violent offenders. The study is led by Dr. David Parenti. Colvin has developed a reputation among academics as a result of his Hamsterdam experiment, and the Deacon helps him secure a job offer with Parenti as a field researcher. Parenti initially plans to focus on 18- to 21-year-olds, but Colvin convinces Parenti to look at Edward Tilghman Middle School for his target group. Colvin identifies for Parenti the two types of West Baltimore students: \\"stoop\\" kids who obey their parents' instructions and who are respectful of authority, and \\"corner\\" kids, the kids who sell drugs, disrupt class, and are aspiring gangsters disrespectful of authority. Together, they isolate ten corner kids into a classroom where Parenti and a UM doctoral student study them while Colvin acts as the mediator. In this classroom, no suspensions are handed down to misbehaving students, as it is seen as a punishment the students often utilize to get out of class intentionally. Colvin begins to take an interest in Namond Brice, one of the most disruptive students. He allows Namond to stay at his home when Carver arrests him for selling drugs and his mother is out of town. Colvin takes him home the next day and sees first hand that his mother is pushing him into drug dealing. After seeing how Namond has progressed in school, Colvin sees Namond's potential and realizes he will only get himself killed or arrested if he remains in his current household. Colvin then talks with Wee- Bey Brice, Namond's incarcerated father, explaining Namond could have a life outside of West Baltimore given the proper support from Colvin and his wife. After thinking it over, Wee-Bey tells Namond's mother to send him to live with Colvin as he wants him to have a future. Namond is seen to be living with Colvin and his wife at the conclusion of season four.  Season five  Colvin appears briefly with a gray and white goatee, attending Namond's high school competitive debate. He looks displeased when Mayor Tommy Carcetti visits the event, using it to burnish his political image. Outside the debate, Carcetti approaches Colvin and apologizes for being unable to support the Hamsterdam experiment, saying no politician could run with the idea politically despite hinting at the time that he supported the initiative. Colvin refuses to shake Carcetti's extended hand, and says nothing about his education plans which were similarly ignored by Carcetti in season four.

Biography Adolphus von Dalberg, born into a long-established noble family of southern Germany, after holding the office of provost at Celle in Hanover for some years, was elected Prince-Abbot of the Benedictine Fulda Abbey in 1724. Though he was not a bishop, Dalberg had quasi-episcopal jurisdiction on the territory belonging to the abbey and held a diocesan synod in 1729. This privilege of quasi-episcopal jurisdiction was granted to the abbots of Fulda by Pope Zachary in 751. Dalberg spared no pains to improve the Roman Catholic educational facilities of Fulda. Its once famous school, which had suffered severely during the religious upheaval of the sixteenth century, had regained some of its ancient prestige by the united efforts of the Jesuits and Benedictines. Dalberg hoped to restore in all its splendour the ancient seat of learning which had made Fulda world-renowned during the Middle Ages. With this end in view he founded a university at Fulda which came to be known after his own name as the Alma Adolphina. The faculties of philosophy and theology he formed by united the two existing schools of the Jesuits and the Benedictines; for the new faculties of jurisprudence and medicine he engaged other professors. Pope Clement XII granted the charter of foundation on 1 July 1732, and Emperor Charles VI, the charter of confirmation on 12 March 1733. The solemn inauguration of the university took place on 19 September 1733. His epitaph already in 1732 in the Fulda Cathedral. Adolphus von Dalberg died on 3 November 1737 at Hammelburg in Lower Franconia. His foundation, the Adolphina, was however not destined to be of long duration. After the suppression of the Jesuit Order by Pope Clement XIV in 1773 the university came entirely into the hands of the Benedictines, who were finally obliged to discontinue it in 1805, in consequence of the Napoleonic secularization of Fulda Abbey in 1802.

History  The NAVS of the UK is the world's first anti-vivisection organisation, founded in 1875 by Frances Power Cobbe, a humanitarian who published many leaflets and articles opposing animal experiments, and gathered many notable people of the day to support its cause, including Queen Victoria and Lord Shaftesbury. Many of the social reformers of the day, working for children's rights and women's rights, supported the aims of the NAVS. The Society was formed on 2 December 1875 in Victoria Street, London, under the name of the Victoria Street Society. At the time there were about 300 experiments on animals each year. Public opposition to vivisection led the Government to appoint the First Royal Commission on Vivisection in July 1875; it reported its findings on 8 January 1876, recommending that special legislation be enacted to control vivisection. This led to the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876, which reached the statute book on 15 August 1876. This Act remained in force for 110 years, until it was replaced by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. The Cruelty to Animals Act 1876 regulated legal vivisection, as well as providing secrecy to the vivisectors and to the laboratories, with no public accountability. The Home Office awarded licences to vivisectors in secret, the locations of laboratories were secret. No access was allowed, - whether Member of Parliament, media, public, or local authority. And so, the numbers of animals used and the number of licences awarded continued to rise for a century, protected by successive governments. However, opposition to vivisection also increased, and in 1897 the growing Victoria Street Society changed its name to the National Anti-Vivisection Society. In 1969 NAVS formed the International Association against Painful Experiments on Animals (IAAPEA).David Henry Smyth ‚Äî Alternatives to animal experiments, p. 218 ‚Äî Scolar Press, 1978 ‚Äî OCLC 465121635 In 1990 the Society, having outgrown the premises in Harley Street it had occupied since 1964 (a move engineered by the then Secretary, Wilfred Risdon), moved to Goldhawk Road, London, with a subsequent move in 2006 to Millbank Tower, London. Founder From the outset the Victoria Street Society had demanded the total abolition of vivisection, and whilst this has always been, and remains the prime objective of the NAVS, at a Council meeting on 9 February 1898 the following resolution was passed: The resolution was carried by 29 votes to 23. Miss Cobbe did not approve of this as she did not want the Society to promote any measure short of abolition. As a result, after the Resolution was passed, Miss Cobbe left the NAVS and formed the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection to demand total and immediate abolition of animal experiments. This resolution of 1898 has remained the policy of the NAVS. Brown Dog affair In 1906, a statue was erected in Battersea Park of a brown terrier dog, one of a number of animals described in the journals of two Swedish anti- vivisection campaigners that was reported to have been illegally dissected during a demonstration to medical students at the University of London. The inscription on the statue reads: The statue became the target of animal researchers and London University medical students; students rioted at the site; anti-vivisectionists defended their statue; the elderly Frances Power Cobbe was attacked in her office. After years of conflict, the statue mysteriously disappeared in 1910. The NAVS and others erected a new statue with the same inscription in 1985, again in Battersea Park, where it remains to this day. Second Royal Commission on Vivisection In 1906 the Government appointed the Second Royal Commission on Vivisection. This Second Royal Commission heard a great deal of evidence from the NAVS and other interested parties. It published its findings in 1912, recommending an increase in the numbers of Home Office Inspectors; further limitations with regard to the use of curare (a paralysing drug which does not deaden pain, but can heighten it); stricter provisions as to the definition and practice of pithing; additional restrictions regulating the painless destruction of animals which show signs of suffering after experimentation; a change in the method of selecting, and in the constitution of, the advisory body of the Secretary of State*; and keeping of special records by vivisectors. (*This body, under the new 1986 Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, is called the Animal Procedures Committee). This was a long way from abolition; it did not deal with the issue of secrecy and public accountability; it left the vivisection community protected from outside control and scrutiny. Although each successive Home Secretary attached ‚Äòpain conditions‚Äô to all experiments, the ‚Äòconditions‚Äô were so worded that they afforded no protection to the animals whatsoever. The NAVS believes there are good scientific arguments against the use of animals in research, not least because of the misleading results from animal experiments, due to species differences. Thus, they argue, abolishing animal research would be in the public interest. However, to pursue such a case would be prohibitively expensive. In 1963, with animal experiments running into millions each year and a public deprived of information on the issue, the Government set up a ‚ÄòDepartmental Committee on Experiments on Living Animals‚Äô to consider the use of animals in research, and whether any changes in legislation were necessary. In 1965 the Littlewood Committee, as it was known, published 83 recommendations, and although none of the recommendations were designed to bring an end to animal experiments, no legislation was passed to put any of them into effect anyway. Throughout the 20th Century, the NAVS lobbied government and drafted various Bills against a seemingly unstoppable rise in animal experiments ‚Äòreaching almost 6 million per year in the UK by the 1970s‚Äô. When the trade in monkeys for use in vaccine tests devastated India's population of rhesus macaques, NAVS representatives went to India and successfully lobbied for a ban on the export of these animals, which was introduced in 1978. In 1973, the NAVS, now based in Harley Street, London, sought a new strategy and founded the Lord Dowding Fund for Humane Research. The Fund was named after Lord Dowding, the Air Chief Marshal and Battle of Britain WW2 hero. After the war, Lord Dowding became President of the NAVS and in the House of Lords made many impassioned speeches on animal experiments. His wife Lady Dowding was also an NAVS Council member (later becoming President after her husband's death). This new strategy was to make positive steps to replace the use of animals in research, and to show that animal research is not necessary for medical and scientific progress. The Lord Dowding Fund continues to be responsible for ground breaking medical and scientific research that does not involve animals. Tens of thousands of animals have been saved, through the introduction of techniques and technology funded by the Lord Dowding Fund for Humane Research. In 1979, the NAVS established World Day for Laboratory Animals (also referred to as Lab Animal Day) on April 24 - Lord Dowding's birthday. This international day of commemoration is recognised by the United Nations, and is now marked annually by anti-vivisectionists on every continent. London and Provincial Anti- Vivisection Society In 1957 the London and Provincial Anti-Vivisection Society (LPAVS) became part of the NAVS. This amalgamation was administered and encouraged by the contemporary Committee Secretary, Wilfred Risdon, who became Secretary of the NAVS thereafter. An earlier active member of the LPAVS was Norah Elam who had been a member (possibly even founding member) from its very beginnings around 1900. Elam was a prominent suffragette who was part of the Pankhurst inner circle from late 1912 to 1917 (under the name Dacre Fox). During 1916/1917 Elam obtained work as supervisor of a typewriting pool at the Medical Research Council (MRC), gaining a wealth of information she was to use later in articles published under the auspices of the LPAVS during 1934 and 1935. In March 1921 Elam advertised in The Times and chaired a public meeting of LPAVS to discuss 'The Dog's Bill' (Bill to prohibit the vivisection of Dogs) that was being debated in Parliament at that time. The meeting was held at Aeolian Hall in London and as Chair, Elam read out 20 letters from Members of Parliament in support of the bill, and stated that, 'A large majority of the public were strongly in favour of the measure, and she felt sure that victory would be theirs if a determined effort were made, especially if women made proper use of their new political power'. In 1932 the MRC had produced a paper called 'Vitamins, A Survey of Present Knowledge'. Elam's 1934 response was entitled 'The Vitamin Survey, A Reply' and was a critical appraisal of that survey and its results. This was followed in 1935 by 'The Medical Research Council, What it is and how it works'. The second paper was based on the same arguments about MRC research practices and remits as the first paper, but distilled and argued more cogently on a broader front. Elam's argument was that 'powerful vested interests' had managed to 'entrench' themselves behind 'State-aided research', and had managed to make themselves unaccountable; the public were unable to influence the decisions about what research should be undertaken, and it operated like a closed shop, only answerable to itself. Elam also argued that the research involved the cruel and inhumane use of animals, and that any thinking person had to question how and why research and results based on animal models could safely be extrapolated to humans. Finally, she complained that animal experimentation was doubly cruel because of the unnecessary repetition of experiments to replicate or prove the same point, which in many cases she argued could have been arrived at by simple, common sense. These papers were widely distributed and copies could be found in libraries throughout the UK. Modern movement After sustained lobbying by animal welfare organisations and other interested parties, in 1983 the UK Government announced that it intended to replace the Cruelty to Animals Act (at that time still in force despite it being introduced nearly one hundred years previously) and published a White Paper that (after consultation) would eventually form the basis of the new legislation. In light of its perceived weakness of the Government's proposals, and realising that outright abolition was unachievable in the current political climate, NAVS worked with other UK groups such as BUAV, Animal Aid and the Scottish Society, in the drawing-up of a list of key experiments that should be banned under new legislation. This list included a ban on the use of animals in tests for cosmetics, tobacco, alcohol products; warfare experiments; psychological and behavioural tests; a ban on the Median lethal dose and Draize eye irritancy tests, as well as other measures in relation to the administration of the legislation. Although the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act received Royal Assent on 20 May 1986 and was later described as being an important factor in the UK having the \\"tightest system of regulation in the world\\", this view was not supported by animal welfare organisations. It would not be until the late 1990s that a change of Government brought in bans on the use of animals for cosmetics research and a ban on the use of great apes would start the process of change. These were followed by the UK's Freedom of Information Act, which permitted wider public scrutiny of some scientific procedures. More recently, in 2009, the year in which the European directive on Animal testing regulations was being comprehensively reviewed for the first time in over two decades, NAVS and its animal and environmental group, Animal Defenders International, joined a call for a Europe-wide ban on the use of non-human primates in research. Although only minor concessions were secured in this area when legislation was subsequently passed in September 2010, the authors of the directive acknowledged that it was \\"an important step towards achieving the final goal of full replacement of procedures on live animals for scientific and educational purposes as soon as it is scientifically possible to do so\\". The authors also recommended that the directive be regularly reviewed so as to reflect the scientific advances made in this area, thereby leaving open the possibility that future legislation will incorporate more safeguards to ensure the protection and welfare of animals used in scientific experiments.  Mission  NAVS claim is that they strive to educate researchers, physicians, manufacturers, teachers and government leaders in the discovery of new, humane methods that will save millions of animals each year and still give our children a safer, healthier and happier future. The International Foundation for Ethical Research (IFER) is a research and funding mechanism of NAVS, a distinct 501(c)(3) organism which \\"supports the development, validation and implementation of innovative scientific methodologies that advance science and replace the use of animals in research, testing and education.\\"International Foundation for Ethical Research (IFER) home pageIFER's Mission  See also  *Women and animal advocacy  References   External links   International Association Against Painful Experiments on Animals website 1875 establishments in the United Kingdom Animal welfare organisations based in the United Kingdom Animal rights organizations Anti-vivisection organizations Organizations established in 1875 ","title":"National Anti-Vivisection Society"},{"id":"6411626","text":"Eastern Orthodoxy is by far the largest religious denomination in Greece.

Biography Valchek is the corrupt Polish-American commander of the Baltimore Police Department in the Southeastern district, home to many of the remaining ethnic white neighborhoods in Baltimore. A politician more than a policeman, he has ties with various Democratic organizations close to City Hall, most notably the politically influential developer Andrew Krawczyk. His political savvy leads to a quick rise through the ranks, despite being disliked by commanding officers such as Commissioner Ervin Burrell and Deputy Commissioner William Rawls. Valchek is Roland \\"Prez\\" Pryzbylewski's father-in-law. Season 1 Valchek makes his first appearance in a meeting with Deputy Commissioner Burrell and Lieutenant Cedric Daniels, trying to smooth over Prez's drunken maiming of a fourteen-year-old. Valchek tells Daniels that if he helps Prez, Valchek will owe him a favor. Season 2 Valchek is the impetus behind an investigation into corruption at the docks, due to his petty feud with stevedore union treasurer Frank Sobotka. Both men want to donate stained glass windows to a local church, and Sobotka refuses to withdraw his larger, more expensive window which had been installed first. Valchek becomes curious as to how the struggling union can afford the window. He has the cops in his district harass Sobotka and his union, from having Ellis Carver ticket their cars for minor infractions to pulling them over for \\"random\\" DUI checkpoints directly outside the bar they frequent. The union steals Valchek's surveillance van and ships it from port to port, sending him photographs from each destination. Valchek discusses the union with Krawczyk, who knows of Sobotka making numerous campaign contributions. Valchek feels there is a possibility of illegal activity, while at the same time noticing Burrell's nomination for Acting Commissioner. Knowing that Burrell has trouble finding support with the first district council members, Valchek offers Burrell political influence in exchange for a special unit devoted to investigating Sobotka, with Prez as the lead investigator. Burrell has Rawls send an investigative team from CID who turn out to be dead-weight \\"humps.\\" When Valchek witnesses the task force's lack of work ethic, he blackmails Burrell into providing him a real police detail led by Daniels. As the investigation expands to cover Greek drug traffickers, Sobotka ceases to be the primary target. An angered Valchek goes to the FBI to try to refocus the investigation, but the Bureau remains more focused on the union than Sobotka. Valchek confronts Daniels' team, insulting and shoving Prez, who responds by punching Valchek in the face. Furious, he disowns Prez and threatens to have him dismissed from the BPD. Daniels convinces him to reduce Prez's punishment, pointing out that any official action will have to mention that Valchek provoked the attack. Valchek grudgingly assigns Prez to two months of duty on the midnight shift at the district's narcotics unit, and accepts a letter of apology in exchange for not charging him. At the close of the investigation, Valchek delights in personally arresting Sobotka, and holds him in the union offices until he can be publicly dragged out in front of the press. Sobotka is later killed, but the surveillance van is still being shipped around the world. Although Valchek harbors great animosity towards Sobotka during the whole season, after Sobotka's death he whispers \\"Spoczywaj w pokoju\\" (Polish for \\"rest in peace\\").  Season 3  Valchek sets up a meeting between Burrell and Tommy Carcetti, a city councilman from Valchek's district, knowing that Carcetti is doing deals behind Mayor Clarence Royce's back. When Royce pressures the BPD to lower crime rates in each district, Valchek announces plans to increase foot patrols in his district's housing projects, use more of his flex squads, request more overtime and \\"juke the stats\\" if all else fails. Valchek is surprised and amused when Major Howard \\"Bunny\\" Colvin stands up to Rawls and questions how to juke the stats with regard to dead bodies. He is amused by Colvin's proposal of drug legalization (ostensibly as a joke) to decrease the felonies in the Western District. Later, during the pursuit of a suspect, Prez accidentally kills a black plainclothes officer. Despite disowning him earlier, Valchek uses his influence to have the charges dismissed. Season 4 After Thomas \\"Herc\\" Hauk, a member of Royce's security detail, catches the mayor receiving fellatio from a secretary, Valchek mentors him on taking advantage of the situation. Acting on Valchek's advice, Herc is promoted to sergeant. Valchek supports Carcetti in the race for mayor, and leaks information on the murder of a state's witness that helps Carcetti best Royce in a debate. When Valchek leaks the news of Burrell's assignment of rookie Kima Greggs on the state's witness case, the fallout leads to Royce deciding to fire Burrell as commissioner. Before this happens, Carcetti is elected Mayor and Burrell hangs on to his position. Carcetti informs Rawls that Valchek will be promoted to Deputy Commissioner of Administration as a reward for his loyalty, but asks Rawls to keep him from doing any damage. At the promotion ceremony, Valchek's wife and daughter are present while Prez is conspicuously absent. As departmental power shifts and Carcetti begins plotting to oust Burrell, Valchek points out to Rawls that Daniels, now promoted to Colonel, is more likely replace Burrell as Commissioner because he is black. Season 5 Valchek leaks the BPD's statistics on increased crime to Mayor Carcetti, urging that both Burrell and Rawls should be fired. He also suggests that Carcetti promote him to Acting Commissioner until Daniels or another African- American is named to the permanent post. Carcetti and assistant Norman Wilson both agree that Valchek is unfit to deal with pressure from the City Council and the minister's alliance, even on an acting basis, but keep the statistics nonetheless. It is later revealed that Valchek is a prime source for Baltimore Sun reporter Roger Twigg. Unable to take disciplinary action for a crime increase due to the department's lack of funding, Carcetti decides he will give Burrell a free pass assuming honest statistics are delivered. When Burrell delivers juked stats showing no increase or decrease in the crime rate, he is unaware that Valchek already released the actual numbers. With the clean and juked statistics in his possession, Carcetti is able to fire Burrell; he leaks a story to the Sun with Daniels' photograph in an effort to appease black voters about the consideration for a change of Commissioner. In the series finale, Daniels is named Commissioner but resigns to prevent an FBI case against him from going public. Valchek is then promoted to the position of Commissioner (with a full five-year term) by new mayor Nerese Campbell. Valchek is not well regarded for his police work throughout the BPD, as mentioned by Leandor Sydnor when he visits Judge Daniel Phelan to get some back-channel pressure applied to a case and mentions how the current police commissioner \\"doesn't have an idea of what police work is\\".

Sydnor is a young, married Baltimore Police detective who was a member of the Barksdale detail and later worked in the Major Crimes Unit. Biography Season one Sydnor is assigned to the Barksdale detail from the Auto Theft Department after Cedric Daniels requests Sydnor's commanding officer, Lt. Cantrell, give him his best detective to balance out having to take \\"his worst\\" - the erratic Roland Pryzbylewski. Once in the detail, he is partnered with Lester Freamon and the pair work on following the Barksdale organisation's paper trail. Sydnor also performs valuable undercover work, making hand-to-hand buys to build evidence, alongside Kima Greggs and her informant Bubbles. Sydnor's initial attempt to disguise himself as a \\"junkie\\" is not credible to Bubbles, but he proves responsible for identifying Avon Barksdale at the annual West-Side versus East-Side basketball game. He later tells Freamon, who has become something of a mentor to the young detective, that the Barksdale investigation is the best police work he has ever done. Season three Sydnor returns to working in his old district after the dissolution of the Barksdale detail. When Daniels establishes the Major Case Unit, he is allowed to choose his own detectives and encourages Sydnor to transfer in, replacing one of the spots vacated by Herc and Carver's transferring out. Sydnor takes up the offer and again works on investigating the Barksdale organization. Season four In Season four, the Major Case Unit starts investigating Marlo Stanfield in addition to the Barksdale money trail. With Daniels promoted to Major, Lester is now the de facto commander of the unit, having been allowed to hand-pick their shift lieutenant Jimmy Asher, a soon-to-retire officer who takes an entirely hands- off approach to the unit's investigations. When the money trail leads the investigation to major political figures, Sydnor worries about the potential damage to his career; nonetheless, he personally delivers the subpoena for financial records to State Senator Clay Davis. Davis angrily protests the subpoenas to Mayor Clarence Royce, who then orders Burrell to rein in the Major Crimes Unit. William Rawls suggests that proper supervision is all the unit needs and replaces Asher with Lieutenant Charles Marimow. Marimow is a caustic commander with a reputation for being a \\"unit killer\\". Marimow's command style drove away Freamon and Greggs, leaving only Sydnor and Massey. Sydnor decides he wants to leave the unit at the first available opening. But with the transfer in of Herc and Kenneth Dozerman, Sydnor gets two allies in his desire to make cases (and who shared his dislike of Marimow), but ultimately the unit is unsuccessful at building a case against Marlo under Marimow's supervision. Over the course of the season, Sydnor mentors Dozerman, and also cautions Herc on the consequences of lying to Marimow, but Herc nevertheless continues to act in an unprofessional and often counterproductive manner while in the unit. The unit is eventually reconstituted under the control of Freamon after Daniels gets promoted to CID colonel. Under Freamon's leadership, Asher is renamed Lieutenant again, and Jimmy McNulty and Kima Greggs transfer back into the unit. Dozerman remains with the unit while Herc is suspended pending an internal investigations division investigation. As the season ends, a new investigative strategy is mapped out against Marlo. Season five After more than a year of investigation into the Stanfield Organization the unit still does not have a strong enough case to file charges. When budget cuts in the department eventually lead to the unit being closed down, Sydnor is disappointed to find his work wasted and realizes that simply keeping Marlo under surveillance was effective in reducing crime. Sydnor and Lester are detailed to the State's Attorney's office to prepare the corruption case against Clay Davis. Sydnor and Freamon first prepare the paperwork on Davis and then assist Rhonda Pearlman in a series of Grand Jury depositions. Sydnor uncovers evidence of Davis having committed a federal crime when he finds that Davis borrowed money from his mother for a mortgage deposit. Freamon realizes the significance of the crime and knows that it could mean a thirty-year jail term. The detectives present the evidence to State's Attorney Rupert Bond and he refuses to take the case federal as he wants to prosecute Davis himself for political reasons. In the series finale, Sydnor visits Judge Daniel Phelan in his chambers to apply back-channel pressure in order to advance an investigation, much like McNulty did in Season 1.

Bunk's character is based on a retired Baltimore detective named Oscar \\"The Bunk\\" Requer. He is portrayed as a generally competent, if profane and curmudgeonly detective. Like his best friend Jimmy McNulty, he also has problems related to infidelity and alcohol abuse, although he is more mindful than McNulty of the department's chain of command.  Casting  According to series creator David Simon, Pierce was cast immediately after completing his audition for the part. In Jonathan Abrams' book All The Pieces Matter, about the process of making The Wire, Simon described Pierce's state of mind at the audition: \\"He was really pissed off. He had gotten in an argument with a cab driver. It was one of those sort of trying-to-hail-a-cab- while-black moments in New York, and he came in and he was steaming.\\" Although he tried to apologize for being upset, the casting staff felt his attitude was perfect for a stressed-out Baltimore homicide detective. Pierce was not aware of the rationale until much later. He described feeling somewhat indignant upon learning about it, but told Abrams, \\"The fact that I would bring it up in the middle of a major audition shows some gumption on my part.\\" Lance Reddick, who was later cast as Cedric Daniels, was originally called in to audition for Moreland. Character storyline Bunk attended Edmondson High School in West Baltimore, where he played lacrosse well enough to make the all-city team. He lives in Randallstown, a predominantly African-American suburb, with his wife Nadine and three children. Bunk worked as a patrolman in Baltimore's Southwestern District before becoming a homicide detective. He is a frequent cigar smoker, and has been described by McNulty as being unable to \\"hold his liquor\\". Season 1 Bunk serves as Jimmy McNulty's lone ally in the Baltimore Police Department's Homicide Unit, informing him of its happenings while chiding him for getting involved in the Barksdale case. He is also the primary investigator for the murder of William Gant, who testified against D'Angelo Barksdale. Omar Little informs Bunk that the shooter is a Barksdale soldier called Bird and agrees to testify against Bird in court. Because of this, Bunk persuades his colleague Ray Cole not to arrest Omar for the murder of Stinkum, a Barksdale associate. When Omar is at the police station, Bunk discovers they attended the same high school, beginning an ongoing association between the two. At Sergeant Jay Landsman's insistence, Bunk and McNulty review the Deirdre Kresson murder, which ultimately turns out to be related to the Barksdales and is solved as part of the final arrests of D'Angelo and Wee- Bey Brice. Season 2 With McNulty having been bumped out to the Marine Unit, Bunk is partnered with Lester Freamon, and they are quickly recognized as the most efficient detectives in Homicide. Landsman assigns them to investigate the deaths of fourteen Jane Does in a shipping container at the Port of Baltimore. They are detailed with Officer Beadie Russell from the Port Authority, who initially found the bodies. Bunk and Freamon track down the ship which carried the container and hold it in port in Philadelphia to question the crew. None of the crew speaks English, and the detectives let the ship go after learning that two crewman jumped ship after Baltimore. Based on a few sparse facts, Bunk and Freamon deduce that the women were prostitutes being smuggled from overseas, that one of the girls was murdered by a sailor after refusing him sex, and the rest were killed for witnessing the crime. The murderer is one of the crewmen who fled, leaving the investigation at an impasse. Bunk and Freamon come under heavy criticism from Colonel William Rawls for releasing the ship without getting statements. While working the port case, Bunk worries about the William Gant murder; State's Attorney Ilene Nathan threatens to drop the charges if the police cannot find Omar. Bunk repeatedly reminds McNulty, who eventually finds Omar with help from Greggs' confidential informant Bubbles. Omar testifies, and Bird is imprisoned for a maximum term. Later, Bunk and Russell return to Philadelphia and find video evidence implicating Sergei Malatov, whose testimony leads to the solving of the Jane Doe murders as well as aids the Major Crimes Unit's investigation into stevedore union treasurer Frank Sobotka. Season 3 When the city deals with five homicides in one night, Bunk must leave his son with McNulty at an Orioles game. Bunk quickly recognizes the scene of Omar's drug robberies and mistakenly believes one of the shootout victims, Tosha Mitchell, was a civilian. He continues to investigate her death even after Landsman, Rawls, and Colonel Raymond Foerster order him to find the stolen weapon of Kenneth Dozerman, who was shot and nearly killed in a failed drug bust led by Sergeant Ellis Carver. The brass consider the weapon's recovery a top priority, but Bunk thinks it is a frivolous use of his abilities. Bunk meets with Omar and confronts him about the \\"innocent\\" victim. Omar informs Bunk that she was part of his crew and says he would never kill an innocent person. In response to Omar's statement that no one will talk to Bunk about the murder, and Tosha died in the game, Bunk makes Omar feel guilty about his negative influence on the world due to the collapse of West Baltimore. Bunk says that predators like Omar are all that still exist in their old neighborhood, which was once a community despite its hardships. To assuage this guilt, Omar finds Dozerman's gun and returns it to Bunk. Later, Bunk is one of the investigators of Stringer Bell's murder. Bunk realizes Omar was the shooter but does not close the case. Afterward, he tells McNulty that the city's homicide rate will probably reach 300 by New Year's, noticing how McNulty has slowed down on his consumption of alcohol. Season 4 Bunk investigates the murder of Fruit, one of Marlo Stanfield's drug dealers. He is unable to find his main suspect, Curtis \\"Lex\\" Anderson. It becomes clear that Lex was murdered, but his body is not found and no leads are forthcoming. At the same time, Bunk is surprised at McNulty's seemingly successful attempts to get his life back on track. Omar contacts Bunk after Chris Partlow frames Omar for killing an innocent woman in a convenience store robbery. Bunk initially ignores him, but Omar appeals to his sense of honor. Bunk tracks down new evidence proving the witness in Omar's case, Old Face Andre, lied, leading to Omar's release. In exchange, Bunk extracts a promise from Omar to never kill again. In the process, Bunk also manages to make an enemy out of Crutchfield, the detective assigned to the Andre case. Freamon transfers back to Homicide and is partnered with Bunk again. Freamon manages to find Lex's body and, in the process, more than 20 other bodies, all of which are linked to Stanfield after Bunk gets key testimony from Lex's mother. Season 5 Bunk and his colleagues in Homicide deal with budget cutbacks, including no overtime pay, until the city's financial situation resolves. The fiscal problems lead to the closure of the Major Case Unit and the reassignment of McNulty and assignment of Greggs to Landsman's squad. While investigating a probable overdose, McNulty tampers with the body and the crime scene to create the illusion of a serial killer, and Bunk leaves in disgust. Later, Bunk learns that McNulty is altering old case files in order to advance the deception. Bunk enlists Freamon to talk sense into McNulty, but this plan backfires when Freamon decides the plan could work and makes suggestions to improve it by sensationalizing the killer. Bunk refocuses his attention on the Stanfield murders and delivers a report to Landsman that is placed immediately into a desk drawer. Landsman points out that Bunk is simply changing the date while submitting essentially the same report. Bunk angrily asserts that he is forced to repeat his requests as he is still waiting for the crime lab to process evidence. Bunk finally gets a DNA match on Partlow for the unrelated murder of Michael Lee's stepfather, but agrees to delay his case in order to allow the Stanfield wiretap to continue. He is last seen investigating a homicide with Greggs, engaging in jovial conversation similar to that he used to share with McNulty.

Active between about 560 and 540 BC, he was the main representative of the '‚Äô‚ÄôLydos Group‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô. His signature, œå ŒõœÖŒ¥œåœÇ, ho Lydos, the Lydian, inscribed on two vases, is informative regarding the cultural background of the artist. Either he immigrated to Athens from the Lydian empire of King Kroisos, or he was born in Athens as the son of Lydian parents. In any case, he learned his trade in Athens. Style It is difficult to definitely recognise his work, since he was the centre and main artist of a highly productive Attic pottery workshop. For that reason, many vases are simply described as in the style of Lydos. Several other individual artists within his circle can be identified, including the Painter of Vatican 309 and Painter of Louvre F 6. These works are quite homogeneous in style, but differ considerably in terms of quality. The style of Lydos strongly resembles that of older artists, such as the painters of Siana cups, of which he himself painted many. He was the last Attic painter to decorate large vases entirely with polychrome animal friezes in the Corinthian style. His human figures resemble the works of Klitias, and later painters, whose humans appear ‚Äúwrapped‚Äù in cloth. Sometimes they have dotted garments, such as preferred by the Amasis Painter. His figures exude a dignity nearly akin to those by Exekias.Boardman: Schwarzfigurige Vasenmalerei, p. 58 The Lydos Group did not only paint large vases, but also known for miniature work. For example, they painted little-master cups and eye-cups. Ascribed to Lydos himself is a band cup potted by Nikosthenes. His early works show a tendency to use colour, which decreased throughout his career. Similarly, at an early stage he paid much attention to certain details, such as the hairy backs of cat-like animals, whereas later he concentrated more on gesture. His animal figures appear somewhat stiff, but are usually highly decorative. Lydos painted vases by a variety of potters, including Nikosthenes, Kolchos, Epitimos and Amasis. His workshop‚Äôs style can be described as out-of-date but was used well into the 520s BC. It is not clear why that is the case; perhaps the material was aimed at older or poorer customers. The last artist to resemble Lydos in style was the Ready Painter. Themes Lydos frequently painted mythological scenes and newly introduced several specific motifs of that genre to Attic vase painting. The quality of his paintings varies. He often painted so-called ‚Äúpenguin women‚Äù, wearing a cloak held together by the chest, probably by a kind of sash, and terminating in a tail-like feature at the back. His men often ere a himation, painted in diagonal stripes, so that they appear as if bandaged. An oinochoe, the vessel itself made by the potter Kolchos (Berlin, Antikensammlung F 1732) depicts mannerist figures.Boardman: Schwarzfigurige Vasenmalerei, p. 59 Athena (supporting Herakles, who is fighting Kyknos) is rendered as a silhouette figure in the style of the Amasis Painter, while the figures of Ares and Zeus (who joins the fighting) represent an attempt to utilise the new three- dimensional drawing style, developed around 540 BC. Lydos‚Äôs palmettes, placed on neck and handles of the vessel are stylistically transitional: they can be seen as a late form of the earlier black-figure style, but also as the beginning of the decorative styles that were to flourish in red-figure vase painting. His best works also include several plates decorated with flying or running figures. One of his plates is decorated with a gorgoneion covering the entire surface. Works Works ascribed to Lydos can be found on all types of vase shape then produced in the Athenian potters‚Äô quarter, including a series of grave pinakes. One of his two signed vases is a dinos, preserved only in fragments and found on the Athenian Acropolis.Athens, National Museum Acr. 607 In style it resembles the works of the Painter of Acropolis 606 and Nearchos. The main frieze depicts a very carefully designed Gigantomachy. Subsidiary friezes show a procession a hunt and various animals. Especially striking aspects of the work are a number of details and the colouring. Lydos painted a wasp as a shield emblazonment and dangerous-looking knives in the procession scene. These martial aspects are balanced by the high-quality animal friezes. Another well-known work by him is a column krater, now in the Metropolitan Museum, New York City.Inventory 31.11.11 It is nearly as large as the Fran√ßois Vase, but is decorated only with a single frieze, so that the figures reach a height of nearly 25 cm. The painter focused not so much on the depicted narrative (return of Hephaistos), but on the gestures of the figures Dionysos and Hephaistos, and even more so of the accompanying satyrs and maenads. He omitted circumstantial detail, as used e.g. by Klitias, and failed to present the satyrs genitals as the Amasis Painter would have. Instead, his satyrs are depicted as ‚Äúgentlemen‚Äù.

He formed the United States Rubber Company, later called Uniroyal and the largest rubber company in the nation.  Early life and education  Samuel P. Colt was born in Paterson, New Jersey, on January 10, 1852, the youngest of six children born to Christopher Colt (brother to arms maker Samuel Colt) and Theodora Goujand DeWolf Colt of Bristol, Rhode Island. His mother was a member of the large and wealthy DeWolf family, most of whose men made their money in the slave trade and related businesses. Colt's friends and family called him \\"Pom\\". In 1875, at the age of 23, he was appointed military aide-de-camp to Rhode Island Governor Henry Lippitt and was commissioned as a colonel in the Rhode Island Militia. He would use this title for the remainder of his life. In 1876, Colt graduated from Columbia Law School.  Career and family  In 1876, at age 24, Colt was elected to represent Bristol in the Rhode Island House of Representatives. He became involved in efforts to regulate child labor and advance women's property rights. He left the legislature in 1879 when appointed Assistant Attorney General for Rhode Island. In 1881 Colt was elected Attorney General of Rhode Island and was re-elected to three one-year terms. He served in office from May 1882 to May 1886. In 1881, Colt married Elizabeth Bullock, also of Bristol. The marriage produced three sons: Samuel Pomeroy, Jr. (1881‚Äì1890), Russell Griswold (1882‚Äì1960), and Roswell Christopher (1889‚Äì1935). Samuel and Elizabeth separated in 1896, and neither remarried. Russell G. Colt married actress Ethel Barrymore. In 1886, Colt founded the Industrial Trust Company, a financial organization; he served as its president until 1908. Later, it became Industrial National Bank, then Fleet Bank, and was ultimately merged into Bank of America. In 1887, Colt was appointed as a receiver for the bankrupt National Rubber Company, based in Bristol. He reorganized the company and reopened it in 1888 as the National India Rubber Company. In 1892, he merged it with several other companies he had acquired to form the United States Rubber Company. Later called Uniroyal, it became the largest producer of rubber goods in the world. In 1901, Colt became president of the company, serving until 1918, when he was appointed Chairman of the Board of Trustees. He was one of the founders of the Rhode Island Society of the Sons of the Revolution in 1896. The following year, he helped found the Rhode Island Society of Colonial Wars, and was assigned state society membership number 1. In 1903, he ran for governor of Rhode Island as a Republican, but failed to unseat the incumbent Lucius Garvin. In 1905, believing that incumbent Republican Senator George P. Wetmore was not going to stand for reelection, Colt announced his candidacy. Wetmore eventually decided to run. The ensuing contest between Colt, Wetmore and Democrat Robert Hale Ives Goddard resulted in 81 deadlocked ballots cast by the General Assembly over four months in 1907 and a vacant seat in Rhode Island's delegation to the 60th Congress. In the end, Colt stepped down, possibly due to ill health. Wetmore was reelected to belatedly join the 60th Congress in January 1908. (Colt's older brother, LeBaron B. Colt, would win this seat in 1913.) Colt died August 13, 1921, of complications from a stroke at Linden Place, the family home in Bristol. A farm owned by Colt was later purchased by the state of Rhode Island and transformed into Colt State Park. Legacy and honors * Colt's home Linden Place is now a historic house museum.

Stoffel (November 18, 1961 ‚Äì December 8, 2004) was an American businessman and arms dealer who was involved with the American reconstruction efforts following the Iraq War. After alerting the Pentagon of corruption and payment irregularities involving U.S. personnel in the Coalition Provisional Authority and with the Iraqi government, he was killed in an ambush in Taji, Iraq. Early career In 1985, Stoffel was recruited by the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) to work on missile technology. In his first year at ONI, his coworker, Jonathan Pollard was arrested for espionage. Stoffel openly despised dishonesty and repeated for years that Pollard was a money grubber who used spying for Israel as a way out. In 1987, he was part of the ONI team that proved that the USS Stark was hit by two missiles, which made it difficult for the Iraqis to claim a single accidentally fired missile was responsible. During the 1990s, he worked on a top secret program for the United States military, procuring Russian, Chinese, and other foreign-made weaponry for testing. In this job, he used Eastern European contacts, especially in Ukraine and Bulgaria, allowing him to purchase surface-to-air missiles and antiaircraft systems. He later became a businessman and arms dealer. His lifestyle mirrored that of a soldier of fortune and he was known to routinely carry an automatic weapon slung across his shoulder with a cigar in his mouth. Among his duties, he was executive vice president of international development for Canonsburg-based CLI Corp. Iraq operations Defense contracts He had a close relationship with a number of Washington lobbyists connected to Ahmed Chalabi. After the Iraq War, Stoffel's company, Wye Oak Technology, received one of the first contracts issued by the new Iraqi Ministry of Defense to refurbish the country's Soviet-era T-55 tanks and artillery. After General David Petraeus sent a July 20, 2004 letter to Iraqi Minister of Defense, Hazim al-Shaalan, pledging full support for Stoffel,Ken Silverstein and T. Christian Miller, Army Ignored Broker on Arms Deal,, Los Angeles Times, March 15, 2005 the contract to Wye Oak was awarded and signed on August 16, 2004.Wye Oak Technology v. Republic of Iraq, , U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, Case 10-1874, December 29, 2011The contract was jointly administered by Wye Oak and another Stoffel-related company, CLI, Inc. The first shipment of tanks arrived in Iraq in November and were used to supply Iraq's 1st Mechanized Brigade. It is reported that Stoffel understood the risks involved with his job, but hoped that by aiding the Iraqi military, he could help U.S. troops return home sooner. All told, his contracts with the Iraqi government were worth more than US$40 million. Corruption Whistleblowing On May 20, 2004, Stoffel was granted limited immunity from prosecution by the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR) in a whistleblower complaint. He gave investigators information regarding U.S. corruption in the Iraqi reconstruction effort that implicated Colonel Anthony B. Bell and SIGIR opened an investigation of him among others.Anthony B. Bell v. Special Inspector General For Iraq Reconstruction, , U.S. District Court, Northern District of Georgia, Case 3:09-cv-00024-JTC-SSC, March 2, 2009 Col. Bell was later implicated in the bribery case of Maj. John Cockerham. In his statement, Stoffel described thousands of dollars in payments being delivered to American contracting offices in pizza boxes, pizza delivery-style, and dead drop payoffs in paper sacks dropped off throughout the Green Zone. Complaints about payments Immediately after delivering the first batch of tanks in November 2004, Stoffel alerted the Pentagon to irregularities regarding the way his company was being compensated. In a November 30, 2004 e-mail to a senior assistant of Petraeus, Stoffel stated, \\"If we proceed down the road we are currently on, there will be serious legal issues that will land us all in jail\\". The Iraqi Ministry of Defence's method of payment gave rise to his suspicions that Iraqi officials were receiving kickbacks. The Ministry was routing payments through Raymond Zayna, a French-Lebanese businessman with a company called General Investment Group, who claimed to be acting as an escrow agent under power of attorney, but later claimed to be a partner of Wye Oak. Stoffel also alleged that the Ministry was forcing him to use preferred sub-contractors. By November, Stoffel was owed $24.7 million from the Ministry. His case was part of a larger trend involving middlemen and kickbacks in the Iraqi government and the rebuilding process. Stoffel returned to the United States in November 2004. He met with Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum, who wrote to Secretary Donald Rumsfeld on December 3, 2004 on Stoffel's behalf, urging the Pentagon to address the issue of payment to Wye Oak Technology with the Iraqi Minister of Defense, Hazim al-Shaalan. With an introduction made by Republican insider Pat Templeton, Stoffel met with Deputy Undersecretary of Defense John A. \\"Jack\\" Shaw to discuss payment to his company and his concerns of corruption in both the U.S. and Iraqi procurement efforts. Shaw's office forwarded the complaint to the Department of the Army. This would prove useless as Shaw, himself under investigation by the FBI for corruption related to Iraq reconstruction contracts, was fired on December 10, 2004 - two days after Stoffel's death.T. Christian Miller, Pentagon Ousts Official Under FBI Investigation, , Los Angeles Times, December 11, 2004 Stoffel returned to Iraq on December 5, 2004. A short time later, he and his business partner Joseph Wemple attended a meeting chaired by British Brig. Gen. David Clements, who was deputy commander of the mission to train Iraqi troops, at the Iraqi Ministry of Defence. Present at the Meeting were Ziyad Cattan of the Iraqi MOD and Raymond Zayna, the Lebanese businessman. After some discussion, Clements told the Iraqi MOD to provide Zayna with the authorization necessary to release the money. Zayna agreed to make an immediate payment of $4.7 million to Stoffel on the condition that Stoffel provide detailed invoices. Friends and colleagues report that Stoffel considered the problem solved at that time. Assassination On December 8, Stoffel met with Clements at Taji, the Iraqi base north of Baghdad where the refurbishment of the armor was carried out. After the meeting, the vehicle carrying Stoffel, Wemple, and an interpreter was attacked. As the car was leaving Taji for Baghdad, a car rammed theirs head-on. Two masked men jumped out and killed Wemple and Stoffel in a hail of bullets; the interpreter was not killed and went missing. Stoffel had been shot several times in the head and back, while Wemple was shot once through the head. A previously unknown group, Brigades of the Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility through an online video. However, security experts doubted the claim and questioned whether the video was simply a ruse. The video described Stoffel as \\"CIA shadow director\\" and \\"close friend of George Bush\\". Aftermath and Investigations His death raised questions about the integrity of the Iraqi reconstruction effort, which had been hampered by corruption. The Sunday Times said that Stoffel's death \\"appeared all too predictable. He was an adventurer who seemed to have met his end at the hands of jihadists while engaged in one of the riskiest businesses on the planet. \\" Following the attacks, CLI, Inc. left Iraq. After Stoffel's death, senior U.S. military officials continued to work with Zayna, who was reported to take over Wye Oak's contract. In January 2005, Petraeus declined to discuss the matter and a spokesman for Petraeus' task force stated that the issue was an \\"MOD [Iraqi Ministry of Defence] matter. There really isn't much ... to our involvement.\\" After being told about e-mails demonstrating that Petraeus' task force was directing the work on the contract, the spokesman said, \\"performance under this contract was of interest\\" to U.S. officials. According to officials investigating his death, there is no evidence that the attack was related to his allegations of corruption. The murders remain unsolved. Stoffel's brother, who also worked for Wye Oak, received several death threats, warning him to stay away from Iraq. In 2009, an investigation into high-level officials, at least partially spawned by Stoffel's 2004 allegations, was opened. The investigation, including the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, the Justice Department, the Army‚Äôs Criminal Investigation Command, and other federal agencies investigated numerous instances of graft and bribery among the Iraqi reconstruction effort. On July 20, 2009, his wife, Barbara sued the Iraqi government for $25 million. Wye Oak, owned by the estate of Dale Stoffel, was the plaintiff versus the defendant, Republic of Iraq, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. On April 23, 2013 the U.S. District Court, District of Columbia, denied the motions of Iraq to have the case dismissed on jurisdictional grounds.WYE OAK TECHNOLOGY, INC. v.

Historian John J. Marshall has called Redmond O'Hanlon Ireland's answer to Robin Hood and Rob Roy MacGregor.John J. Marshall, Irish Tories, Rapparees and Robbers; With Some Account of the Most Notable, Tyrone Printing Company, Dungannon, 1927. Page 23. Stephen Dunford has further dubbed O'Hanlon, \\"The Irish Skanderbeg.\\"  Family background  Coat of Arms of the O'Hanlon Chief of the Name. Although born in impoverished circumstances, Redmond was part of the Derbfine of the last O'Hanlon Chief of the Name, Lord of Airg√≠alla, and Master of Tandragee Castle. During the Nine Years' War, Sir Oghie O'Hanlon had allied the Clan with Queen Elizabeth I of England against Hugh O'Neill and Red Hugh O'Donnell. In 1606, Sir Oghie received his Clan's lands under the policy of Surrender and regrant. According to Royal decree, the family's manor was to be passed on to Sir Oghie's heirs under Primogeniture, rather than the Brehon Law policy of Tanistry. Sir Oghie's grant was revoked, however, when his son and many other relations joined Sir Cahir O'Doherty's Rebellion in 1608. As a result, the O'Hanlon family was reduced to ruling a small portion of the clan's former homeland. The rest became the property of Sir Oliver St. John, the Lord Deputy of Ireland, who evicted the O'Hanlons from the best land on his estate, which was planted with Scottish and English Protestants. During the Irish Rebellion of 1641, the O'Hanlon clan rose and attempted to retake their traditional lands in vain. Sir Oghie's heirs lost what little land they still possessed following the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. In accordance with the Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652, the O'Hanlon family's remaining lands were confiscated and they were deported to Connaught.Marshall (1927), page 23-24. Early life According to John J. Marshall, > Of the childhood and upbringing of the famous outlaw we have no reliable > account, but a very rare pamphlet on the life and death of Redmond O'Hanlon, > dated 1st August 1681 and published in Dublin, 1682, states that \\"Redmond, > son of Loghlin O'Hanlon, was born near Poyntzpass in the County of Armagh in > the year 1640,\\" but some of the later lives say he was born at the foot of > Slieve Gullion, and local tradition confirms this. \\"It was his good fortune > to be educated in an English school where he attained to such perfection in > that language that it might have proved a great advantage to him in the > afterlife.\\" His linguistic accomplishments certainly did prove useful to him > in the afterlife.

Cosgrave's account seems quite probable when he says ‚Äì > \\"Redmond once happened to be at the killing of a gentleman in a quarrel, and > flying for safety, stayed abroad for a long time, still refusing to come to > a trial, till he was outlawed, which put him into his shifts.\\" It is likely > that O'Hanlon fled to France and there joined the Army where he acquired > which he so often turned to good use in his after-career, and also was able > to speak French like a native, Gaelic and English being equally at his > command.Marshall (1927), page 24. It is not known when he returned to Ireland, but Stephen Dunford suggests it was around 1660, after the Restoration of King Charles II to the British and Irish thrones. Like all the other Irish landowners who had been dispossessed for supporting King Charles I of England during the English Civil War, the O'Hanlon family soon realized that there would be no restoration of their property by the new King. In response, Redmond took to the hills around Slieve Gullion and became an outlaw, or rapparee. According to Stephen Dunford, \\"He is likely to have seen himself as one of the chieftains of the clan and therefore honour-bound to exact justice.\\"Dunford (2000), page 38. Outlaw Although Redmond O'Hanlon has often been compared to a real-life Robin Hood, he has much more in common with Rob Roy MacGregor. Like many Irish and Scottish clan chiefs of the same era,W. H. Murray (1982), Rob Roy MacGregor: His Life and Times, Barnes & Noble Books. Pages 59-64. O'Hanlon operated an extralegal Watch over the Anglo-Irish landlords and Ulster Scots merchants of Armagh, Tyrone, and Down. In return for an annual fee, O'Hanlon retrieved cattle and horses stolen from landlords under his Watch and paid in full for what could not be restored. Peddlers and merchants who placed themselves under the Count's Watch were provided with a written pass, which was to be shown to highwaymen wishing to rob them. The protection money O'Hanlon received, which Protestant landlords and settlers in Ireland referred to as \\"black rent\\", was used to pay O'Hanlon's many spies and to feed his clansmen and their families. Anyone who robbed travellers who carried the Count's passes or rustled livestock from herds under his Watch were forced to return the stolen money or merchandise and we're fined for the first two offences. Tories who did so a third time were killed. O'Hanlon is described as scrupulously adhering to his word once it was given. In 1674 the authorities in Dublin Castle put a price on Redmond O'Hanlon and several other known outlaws. In 1676, the price was increased, with posters advertising for his capture, dead or alive.Marshall page 26. A 1681 pamphlet describes his character: > \\"Necessity first prompted him to evil courses and success hardened him in > them; he did not rob to maintain his own prodigality, but to gratify his > spies and pensioners: Temperance, Liberality, and Reservedness were the > three qualities that preserved him; none but they of the House where he was > knew till the next morning where he lay all night; he allowed his followers > to stuff themselves with meat and good liquor, but confined himself to milk > and water; he thought it better thrift to disperse his money among his > Receivers and Intelligencers, than to carry it in a purse, or hide it in a > hole; he prolonged his life by a general distrust.\\"Dunford (2000), page 42. Tory Hunters According to Stephen Dunford, \\"Tory hunting was then a popular pastime and many adventurers eagerly joined in the chase... It was a lucrative business and in June 1676 alone seven known outlaws had been killed. Two of the most notorious Tory-hunting families in the country were the Cootes of Cootehill and the Johnstons of the Fews, planters infamous for their cruelty and ruthlessness in tracking down and murdering priests. Tradition has it that on one occasion the Johnstons tracked Redmond as far as the shore of Carlingford Lough. With the pursuers at his heels, the outlaw was left with no option but to swim the estuary. He was spotted entering the water by the hunters, they unleashed a ferocious hound and the massive animal plunged into the water in pursuit. The dog caught up with Redmond and a fierce struggle ensued, man against beast, with the outlaw proving victorious: he drowned the dog and escaped.\\"Dunford (2001), page 277. Also according to Dunford, \\"He was nothing if not resourceful. Legend has it that when the need arose Redmond was known to reverse his horse's shoes to confuse his pursuers. There are accounts of him and his gang using reversible jackets ... When turned inside out they became the red coats of the army, and were used on many occasions to outwit the authorities and unsuspecting travellers.\\"Dunford (2001), page 41. The informer-priest Medieval front of the ruined 6th Century Killeavy Old Church, Killeavy Roman Catholic priest Fr. Edmund Murphy was stationed in Killeavy, County Armagh, a parish located in the heart of O'Hanlon country. On the instructions of Archbishop Oliver Plunkett, Father Murphy began denouncing the Count and his co-conspirators from the pulpit. In a pamphlet printed in London as propaganda for the Titus Oates Plot, Father Murphy alleged that the Count responded by threatening Father Murphy with dire consequences if he did not desist. When Father Murphy ignored the warning, O'Hanlon decreed that any parishioner who attended a Mass offered by the Rector of Killeavy would be fined one cow for the first offence, two for the second offence, and for the third offence would be killed. After this threat was carried out against two Killeavy parishioners, Father Murphy arranged for another priest to take his place and began to spend an increasing amount of time plotting vengeance against Redmond O'Hanlon.Marshall (1927), page 28. In this Father Murphy was assisted by Cormacke Raver O'Murphy, a former O'Hanlon associate who had begun brazenly robbing travellers who carried the Count's passes. Together, Father Murphy and Cormacke Raver began plotting a means to lure the Count to a location where he could be captured or assassinated. To Father Murphy's outrage, however, Ensign John Smith and Lieutenant Henry Baker, who commanded the local British Army garrison, were profiting considerably from their alliance with O'Hanlon and had no desire to curb the Count's activities. Ultimately, Cormacke O'Murphy was assassinated by a disgruntled associate who had secretly allied himself with O'Hanlon. Father Murphy, however, was unwilling to give up.Marshall (1927), pages 28‚Äì31.  Henry St. John  Anglo- Irish landowner Henry St. John, who had inherited the traditional lands of the O'Hanlon clan from his uncle, Sir Oliver St. John. According to the Reverend Lawrence Power, an Anglican minister whose parish at Tandragee stood on Henry St. John's estate and enjoyed his patronage, \\"Mr. Henry St. John scorned to have any correspondence with such rascals, no not to redeem a stolen horse or cow, he defied and prosecuted them to the uttermost...\\"Reverend Lawrence Power, The Righteous Man's Portion, London, Printed by J.M. for Henry Bonwicke at the Red-Lyon in St. Paul's Church-Yard, 1680. Page A6. Henry St. John also earned Redmond's undying hatred by continuing his uncle's policy of evicting the Count's clansmen en masse and replacing them with Scotch-Irish Protestants. In response, Redmond O'Hanlon retaliated by ordering the mass theft of Henry St. John's livestock and the armed robbery of his factors and rent collectors. Seething with hatred, Henry St. John began waging a private war against the O'Hanlon Gang. The death of his nineteen-year-old son from a chill gained while pursuing the Count only made Henry St. John increasingly brutal toward anyone suspected of aiding Redmond O'Hanlon. In his letters to The Vatican, Archbishop Oliver Plunkett alleged that tory-hunters like Henry St. John spent more time sacking, pillaging, and burning out law-abiding Catholics than actively searching for rapparees and tories. This may have been done, however, in order to provoke hunted outlaws into coming out of hiding to fight. As a result of the ensuring persecution, large numbers of Catholic refugees began fleeing to County Donegal. On 9 September 1679, St. John was riding on his estate with a manservant and the Reverend Power, Vicar of Tandragee. A party of Tories rode into view and seized him. Although Stephen Dunford believes that the intention was simply to hold St. John for ransom, Reverend Power was warned that the landlord would be killed if a rescue was attempted. Moments later, a group of the St. John family's Protestant tenants rode into view and opened fire on the kidnappers. As a result, Henry St. John received a pistol ball in the forehead. According to Reverend Power, the fatal shot was fired, point-blank, by the Tory who was leading away Henry St. John's horse. Rumours among the Armagh gentry alleged that the landlord had been slain by friendly fire from his own tenants. It was further said that St. John had dealt dishonourably with local Tories and therefore deserved what he got. At the landlord's funeral, an outraged Reverend Power denied both claims. He also denounced both the rapparees and the many local Protestant landlords who did business with them. His sermon read in part, \\"I can boldly say in front of you all, that I have heard many of you accuse one another of harbouring this infamous rebels and that they help to furnish your kitchens and tables.\\"Dunford (2001), page 44. Rev. Power climaxed by demanding that local Protestants prove their racial superiority to the native Irish by rising up and destroying the rapparees and Tories. The full text of Reverend Power's sermon was printed by in London as propaganda for the Titus Oates Plot. It was given the name, \\"The Righteous Man's Portion.\\" Reverend Power also began sending letters to the Lord Deputy of Ireland, James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde, and pleaded with him to destroy Redmond O'Hanlon. He further named several prominent aristocrats and Crown officials who had regular dealings with local outlaws. In one such letter, Rev. Power wrote, \\"Their chief Redmond O'Hanlon is described as a cunning, dangerous fellow, who, though proclaimed an outlaw along with the rest of his crew and sums of money on their heads, yet he reigns and keeps in subjection so far that is credibly reported, he raises more in a year by contribution than the King's Land, Taxes, and Chimney-Money come to; and thereby is enabled to bribe Clerks and Officers, if not their masters, and makes all to much truckle for him.\\"Dunford (2001), page 276. According to Ulster's oral tradition, Redmond O'Hanlon travelled to visit his family in Letterkenny, County Donegal, where they were prospering as merchants under the protection of the Chief of Clan O'Doherty and Sir John Conyngham, whose brother David had married the Count's sister. Redmond O'Hanlon remained in Donegal until the heat died down over Henry St. John's assassination. Also according to legend, he had a dalliance with Sir John's daughter. The Titus Oates Plot St. Oliver Plunkett, Archbishop of Armagh In 1678, former Catholic seminarian Titus Oates had gone public with allegations of a non-existent Catholic conspiracy aimed at assassinating King Charles II of England and massacring the Protestants of the British Isles. As a result, more than 22 Catholic clergy and laity were falsely convicted of high treason and executed at Tyburn. The last to be hanged, drawn, and quartered, was Archbishop Oliver Plunkett of Armagh. In 1680, Father Edmund Murphy agreed to testify falsely at the high treason trial of Archbishop Plunkett. When this became known in Armagh, Ensign Smith and Lt. Baker set out to assassinate the priest. Whether they did so at O'Hanlon's orders remains unknown. However, Father Murphy was placed in Dublin Castle for his own protection. In retaliation, Lt. Baker and Ensign Smith murdered one of Father Murphy's informants and delivered his head to the Lord Deputy as that of a hunted outlaw. To Father Murphy's outrage, they were paid a substantial bounty.Marshall (1927), pages 28‚Äì31. According to John J. Marshall, Redmond O'Hanlon was offered a full pardon by Rev. Henry Jones, the Church of Ireland's Welsh-born Bishop of Meath. Bishop Jones, who Marshall describes as, \\"an ultra-Protestant,\\" was interested in using the outlaw Count as a witness against Archbishop Plunkett and other alleged Catholic traitors.Marshall (1927), pages 32‚Äì33. According to Stephen Dunford, \\"O'Hanlon refused. He protested that no offer could induce him to betray an innocent man, even though the man in question had on numerous occasions denounced outlaws: during the General Synod of the Irish Church in 1670, the Archbishop had ordered priests and preachers to warn all their people against, 'giving aid to Tories.'\\"Dunford (2001), page 279. Slieve Gullion. As persecution of Catholics heated up in reaction to the Titus Oates plot, a priest named Father Mac Aidghalle was murdered while saying Mass at a Mass rock that still stands atop Slieve Gullion. The perpetrators were a band of redcoats under the command of a priest hunter named Turner. Redmond O'Hanlon is said in local tradition to have avenged the murdered priest and in so doing to have sealed his own fate. Tony Nugent (2013), Were You at the Rock? The History of Mass Rocks in Ireland, pages 80-81. The Viceroy's murder plot Count Redmond O'Hanlon's nemesis, James Butler, Duke of Ormond. In the spring of 1680, the Duke of Ormonde ordered one of his Dublin spies to find, \\"an army man in the Armagh area with the credentials to carry out a dangerous undercover task.\\"Dunford (2001), page 45. At the advice of his agent, the Viceroy selected William Lucas, an Anglo-Irish landlord from Dromantine, County Down. The Lucas family had a long and profitable history with the O'Hanlon gang. Furthermore, Lucas' uncle, Sir Toby Poyntz of Poyntzpass, a justice of the peace, had been named by Rev. Power one of the outlaw Count's closest associates in the Ulster gentry. Despite this, the Duke gave Lucas a written statement: > \\"Whereas William Lucas Gent. hath given me good reason to believe that he is > able to do His Majesty good service in the Apprehending, Killing, and > Destroying of proclaimed Rebels and Tories; if he may, upon occasion, have > the help and assistance of His Majesty's Army, as he shall desire. These are > therefore to Will and Require all His Majesty's Officers, Civil and > Military, to be aiding and assisting to the said William Lucas in the said > service. And I particularly require all Officers of Horse and Foot, to send > as many of the Soldiers, under their respective Commands, as he shall desire > with him; and to direct such Soldiers to obey his Orders. And I further > Authorize the said William Lucas in my Name to give assurance to any of the > Tories, that in case they shall assist him in the performance of the said > service, that they shall have His Majesty's Gracious Pardon for any Crimes > formerly committed by them, Murder only accepted. And that over and above, > they shall be well rewarded. Given at His Majesty's Castle of Dublin this > 4th of March, 1680. Ormond.Count Hanlan's Downfall, page 5. In December 1680, Sir Toby Poyntz and his son Charles arranged for Lucas to speak with Art McCall O'Hanlon, the Count's foster brother and trusted bodyguard.Dunford (2001), pages 278‚Äì279. Using the Viceroy's authorisation, Lucas offered Art a full pardon and half of the bounty in exchange for the murder of Count Redmond O'Hanlon. Art O'Hanlon accepted the offer and began searching for an opportune moment. In response, Lucas gave Art a written pardon which explained that the Count's foster brother was under his protection.Count Hanlan's Downfall, pages 5‚Äì6. Assassination On 25 April 1681, Count Redmond O'Hanlon was fatally shot by Art MacCall O'Hanlon near Hilltown, County Down. According to the most popular account, the murder took place while the Count was sleeping.Marshall (1927), page 35. A 1681 pamphlet, however, gives a very different account which it claims comes directly from Art O'Hanlon. According to the pamphlet, > \\"...the said Art O Hanlan and William O Sheel, in company with Redmond O > Hanlan, were near the Eight Mile Bridge in the County of Down, on the score > of a Fair that was held there, at which place, while they were watching for > their Prey, Redmond took some occasion to quarrel with Art, as they were > smoking their pipes, and in the close bid him provide for himself, for he > should not be any longer a Tory in any of the three Counties (viz. Monaghan, > Down, or Armagh) whereupon Art rose up and said, 'I am very glad of it, and > will go just now'; and then taking up his Arms (having his authority and > protection on about him) immediately he shot Redmond in the left breast with > his carbine, and forthwith ran to the Eight Mile Bridge for a Guard, but Art > returned with a Guard, and Mr. Lucas, who soon had notice in Newry where he > was waiting for Redmond's motions, for the same Ensign found Redmond's body, > but the head was taken off by O Sheel, who fled with it, the body they > removed to Newry, where it lies under a Guard till Orders be sent how it > should be disposed of; and since that Mr. Lucas has sent out a Protection > and Assurance to O Sheel, to bring in the Head of that Arch-Traitor and Tory > Redmond O Hanlan.\\"Count Hanlan's Downfall; or A True and Exact Account of > the Killing of that Arch Traitor and Tory Redmond O Hanlan, Printed by > Joseph Ray at College Green, for William Winter, Bookseller at the Wandring > Jew in Castlestreet, 1681. Page 7. After William O'Sheel surrendered it to William Lucas, Redmond O'Hanlon's head was placed on a spike over Downpatrick jail. The Count's body was buried in the Roman Catholic cemetery at Ballynabeck, on the road between Tandragee to Scarva. Art McCall O'Hanlon received a full pardon and one hundred pounds from the Lord Deputy for murdering his foster brother. William Lucas received a Lieutenant's commission. However, Lieutenant William Lucas continued to hunt down and summarily execute large numbers of real and imagined outlaws and collected bounties for their heads. Art O'Hanlon and William O'Sheel acted as his \\"spotters.\\" This led, according to Marshall, to, \\"a veritable reign of terror,\\" in the three counties, \\"especially among the native Irish.\\"Marshall (1927), page 35. On 29 May 1681, Captain Thomas Whitney, an officer stationed in Tandragee, wrote the following words to the Duke of Ormonde, > \\"...the natives, who never durst trust themselves with their houses nor > homes since the death of the boy of fifteen or sixteen years, who was killed > lately near Newry, and his head sent for a Tory's head to Armagh. My Lord, I > endeavoured by all the means I could to take off their fear, and told them > that Your Grace upon notice of the wrongs done them by those that pretend > authorities of Your Grace for doing service, require a relation of your > inquiries from Sir George Rawdon, Sir Hans Hamilton, and others. My Lord, > this day I saw a boy of thirteen years old come to Sir Hans Hamilton, and > begged upon his hands and knees that his life be secured for that he was > returned a Tory and Art O'Hanlon was in search for him to cut off his head. > My Lord, several poor people whose cattle and goods the Mullens of Tandragee > took, and others who were like to starve, I had restored. My Lord, very sad > and great wrongs there is done and in these parts, and will be more unless > speedily enquired into.\\"Marshall (1927), page 35-36. Family Conwal Parish Church, Letterkenny, County Donegal. According to legend, the Count's mother travelled to Downpatrick and composed an Irish language keen. Stephen Dunford gives the following translation: : \\"Dear head of my darling, : How gory and pale; : These aged eyes see thee, : High spiked on their jail. : That cheek in the summer, : No more will grow warm; : Nor that eye e'er catch light, : But the flash of the storm.\\"Dunford (2001), page 48. According to tradition, the O'Hanlon and Conyngham families travelled to Ballynabeck, exhumed the Count's remains, and buried them in a family plot in Conwal Parish Church cemetery in Letterkenny, County Donegal.Dunford (2001), pages 47‚Äì48. The site, near the Vestry door, is marked by a flat gravestone inscribed with the O'Hanlon coat of arms. The inscription reads: > \\"The five sons of Redmond Hanlen, Mercht. in Letterkenny: John, the > firstborn, Alexander, Francis, John and Redmond. Also here lieth the body of > William, the son of the aforesaid Redmond Hanlen who departed this life the > 27th ...1708, aged ...3 years ...months and 14 days. Also the remains of > David Conyngham, Gent., and Cath., his wife, daughter to Redmond Hanlen. > They were esteemed more for goodness of heart than for affluence of fortune. > Died lamented here on ...December 1752, 72 years old. She 21st August, 1775, > aged 80.\\"Dunford (2001), page 48. In popular culture Redmond O'Hanlon's popularity was immortalised in the pulp fiction of the era in addition to folktales which survive to the present day. The legends focus upon his ability to humiliate the Anglo-Irish gentry and the redcoats. According to D. J. O'Donoghue's account of his 1825 Irish tour, Sir Walter Scott was fascinated by the life and career of Redmond O'Hanlon. Hoping to make him the protagonist of an adventure novel, Scott corresponded with Lady Olivia Sparrow, an Anglo-Irish landowner from County Down. Although Scott asked Lady Sparrow to obtain as much information as possible about O'Hanlon, he was forced to give up on the project after finding documentation too scanty.D. J. O'Donoghue, Sir Walter Scott's Tour in Ireland in 1825: Now First Fully Described, Dublin: O‚ÄôDonoghue & Gill, 1905. Pages 10‚Äì11. In 1862 William Carleton published Redmond Count O'Hanlon; The Irish Rapparee, an adventure novel inspired by the outlaw Count's life. One of Carleton's biographers alleges that the novelist glorified a 17th-century rapparee because he did not feel able to praise the Ribbonmen of his own era. According to O'Donoghue, however, Carleton's novel does not depict the historical Redmond O'Hanlon, but rather a figure of his own imagination.O'Donoghue (1905), page 11. More recently, Count Redmond O'Hanlon's name is mentioned in The Ballad of Douglas Bridge by Francis Carlin. His career is also celebrated in folk songs composed by P.J. McCall and Tommy Makem. In Poyntzpass, County Armagh, the local Gaelic football team is named \\"The Redmond O'Hanlons\\" in his honour. Furthermore, O'Hanlon's life was the subject of an episode of the television documentary series \\"Rapair√≠\\", which aired on TG4 in November 2009. In 2019 Michael Kerrigan published An Universal Wolf: The Life & Times of Redmond O'Hanlon. It is an historical novel that is based on real people and actual events. Part fact, part legend, the tale is composed of history, myth, and conjecture. Persons and events described within it relate to an obscure but significant period in Irish history: significant because the struggle between the natives and the settlers that began with the Plantation of Ulster continues still, 400 years later. Traced back to the original Norman Invasion of Ireland in 1169, however, establishes The Troubles as the longest-lived conflict in the history of the world.

He was the 3rd Director General of Hospitals of the Continental Army. Early life He was born on October 21, 1736 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was the son of William Shippen Sr. (1712‚Äì1801), also a doctor, and Susannah (n√©e Harrison) Shippen. His sister, Susan Shippen, was married to Samuel Blair, the second Chaplain of the United States House of Representatives. He studied at the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), graduating in 1754. He studied medicine first with his father, then went to England and Scotland and in 1761 earned his medical degree at the University of Edinburgh Medical School. Career Shippen followed his father William Shippen Sr. into a medical career. At his father's encouragement, William Jr. commenced America's first series of anatomy lectures in 1762. He became one of the first professors (of anatomy, surgery, and midwifery) of America's first medical school (the College of Philadelphia, now the University of Pennsylvania), which he co-founded in 1765 with Dr. John Morgan. At the time, male midwifery was considered \\"offensive\\" and people threw stones through the windows of his dissecting rooms and occasionally burst into his rooms in mobs. Like his father, William Shippen Jr. was elected to the revived American Philosophical Society in 1767, where he served as Curator from 1771-1772, and as Secretary from 1772-1773.Bell, Whitfield J., and Charles Greifenstein, Jr. Patriot-Improvers: Biographical Sketches of Members of the American Philosophical Society. 3 vols.

American Revolution During the American Revolutionary War, Shippen served as Chief Physician & Director General of the Hospital of the Continental Army in New Jersey (1776) and as Director General of the Hospitals West of the Hudson River (October 1776). Ultimately, he served (April 11, 1777 ‚Äì January 1781) as Director of Hospitals for the Continental Army, a precursor of the Surgeon General of the U.S. Army. Shippen had connived to replace Dr. Morgan, his predecessor in that position. Later Morgan, with the assistance of Dr. Benjamin Rush, brought about his forced resignation. He was subsequently court martialed for misappropriating supplies intended for recovering soldiers and underreporting deaths, but was acquitted on a technicality. Shippen was among the founders of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia and served as its president 1805‚Äì1808. He was also a member of the original board of trustees of Old Pine Street Church. Personal life Shippen was married to Alice Lee (1736‚Äì1817), the daughter of Thomas Lee and Hannah Harrison Ludwell.

Largely without formal training in composition, he produced a wide range of compositions across different genres, including many songs and works for choirs. He also edited and arranged the works of other composers. Most of his teaching was within the framework of the Extramural Departments at Oxford University and London University. He was a popular broadcaster on BBC music programmes, and the author of several books. Life Early life Bush was born in Kilburn, London, on 23 March 1920, the son of Christopher Bush, a schoolmaster and writer, and his wife Winifred, n√©e Chart (John Warrack's ODNB biography gives the father's forenames as \\"Charles Christmas\\"). Bush's parents separated at around the time of his birth, and he never knew his father. He began piano lessons at the age of seven, and the following year became a chorister at Salisbury Cathedral choir school, where he remained until 1933, studying under Walter Alcock and acquiring a lasting love of traditional English church music. He began composing at the age of ten. In 1933 he went to Lancing College, where his early compositional efforts were subject to harsh criticism; this led him to destroy his early works, an action that he later regretted. While at Lancing, Bush met the composer John Ireland, who gave him lessons in composition; the association would last until Ireland's death in 1962. Encouraged by Ireland, Bush entered Balliol College, Oxford in 1938, on a Nettleship scholarship. He took his B.Mus degree in 1940, but his Oxford studies were then interrupted by the Second World War As a pacifist and conscientious objector, Bush served between 1941 and 1945 as assistant warden in the Hostel of the Good Shepherd, a children's home in Tredegar, Wales. During this period he composed a considerable number of works, including his first attempt at opera, The Spanish Rivals, later withdrawn. He returned to Oxford in 1945, where in 1946 he took an MA degree in Classics, and a D.Mus. Career Bush began his teaching career in 1947, as an extramural lecturer at Oxford. In 1952 he transferred to the Extramural Department at London University where over the following 40 years he fulfilled various roles, including that of Senior Staff Tutor from 1964 to 1980. He was largely responsible for the development of the London University External Diploma in the History of Music. He was also a visiting professor at King's College, London from 1969 to 1989, and was made a Fellow of University College, Wales in 1986. Bush served on a number of public bodies, including the Composers Guild of Great Britain, where he was the Guild's delegate on a visit to the USSR in 1964, the Performing Rights Society, and the Arts Council. He was musical adviser to the John Ireland Charitable Trust. Bush maintained his pacifist credentials, as a supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), and the Anglican Pacifist Fellowship. These interests were reflected in his short opera The Equation (1967). Alongside his teaching, Bush composed a large number of works, including orchestral pieces, operas, choruses and songs. His \\"Yorick\\" Overture was awarded the Royal Philharmonic Society's prize in 1949. He wrote two symphonies in the 1950s, the first of which was first performed at the 1954 Cheltenham Festival, and at the Proms in 1958. His Second Symphony was commissioned by the city of Guildford for the 700th anniversary of the city's foundation. Bush edited volumes of songs by Hubert Parry and Stanford, and provided the orchestration for Stanford's Third Piano Concerto. His writings included several published books, including Musical Creation and the Listener (1954); Left, Right and Centre (1983); and An Uncertain Education (1990). He edited several editions of Musica Britannica, and was a regular and popular broadcaster of BBC music programmes. Bush was a polished pianist, and was organist at St Luke's Church, Chelsea, where he succeeded Ireland. In April 1950 he married Julia McKenna; the marriage produced two sons. Outside the world of music, Bush was a keen student of detective fiction, and collaborated with his fellow-composer Bruce Montgomery (who wrote under the name Edmund Crispin) in a story \\"Who Killed Baker?\\". Bush's 70th birthday in 1990 was marked by a \\"Celebration of English Song\\", held at London's Wigmore Hall. He died in London on 24 February 1998. Music Bush composed across a wide variety of genres, including orchestral, chamber and keyboard works, choral works for accompanied and accompanied choirs, operas, and many songs with either piano or instrumental accompaniment. He was happiest writing songs and operas, although he deemed song-writing as a \\"futile\\" occupation: \\"[I[t is distinctly discouraging for a composer who has written (as I have) nearly a dozen cycles to find, far from having sung them, most singers do not even know they exist\\". Many of his songs are settings of classical verse, from Chaucer, Shakespeare, Robert Herrick, Ben Jonson and Shelley, although he also set more modern poets such as Stevie Smith and Kathleen Raine. A scholar of Elizabethan and Victorian music, Bush composed largely in the English tradition; his operas, and some of his later songs, reflect the influences of Purcell and Britten. He was not averse to the adoption of other idioms ‚Äì in his First Symphony he included a blues-style slow movement, as a tribute to his friend and fellow-composer Constant Lambert. Malcolm Miller, in his summary of the composer's work for Grove Music Online, writes: \\"His insights into Elizabethan polyphony and 19th-century harmony infuse his many transcriptions and Stravinskian arrangements, while his music‚Äôs chromaticism, within a broadly tonal idiom, its love of counterpoint and its delicate, colourful orchestration betray the influences of Prokofiev.\\" Recordings Recordings are available for a significant proportion of Bush's compositions; several discs have been released that are devoted entirely to his works, while various individual songs and other items can be found in assorted albums devoted to English music. Major recorded works include both symphonies, the Yorick Overture, the Christmas Cantata, the opera Lord Arthur Savile's Crime and the Oboe Concerto.

Its farthest extent is Cape Apostolos Andreas, and its major population centre is the town of Rizokarpaso (; ). The peninsula de facto forms the ƒ∞skele District of Northern Cyprus, while de jure it lies in the Famagusta District of the Republic of Cyprus. Geography It covers an area of 898 km2, making up 27% of the territory of Northern Cyprus. It is much less densely populated than the average of Northern Cyprus, with a population density of 26 people per km2 in 2010. The town of Trikomo (ƒ∞skele), the district capital, is considered to be the \\"gateway\\" and the geographical starting point of the peninsula, along with the neighboring village of Bogazi (Boƒüaz). Apart from Trikomo, the most important towns and municipalities in the area are Yialousa, Galateia, Rizokarpaso, Komi Kebir and Akanthou. The peninsula hosts a number of historical sites such as Kantara Castle and Apostolos Andreas Monastery, as well as the ruins of Agia Trias Basilica and the ancient cities of Karpasia and Aphendrika among numerous others. There are more than 46 sandy beaches in the peninsula, which are the primary Eastern Mediterranean nesting grounds for the loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas). The Golden Beach (; ), also known traditionally in Greek-Cypriot as Pashi-Amos (\\"Fat Sand Beach\\"), or Nangomi Beach, is situated around 15 km from the town of Rizokarpaso and is considered one of the finest and most remote beaches of Cyprus. With a total length exceeding 3700 m, it is one of the least tourist-frequented beaches in the island.\\"Karpaz-Akdeniz'in Saklƒ± Cenneti\\", Caretta&Caretta;, 50, November 2008, p. 30-44. The Karpas Peninsula is home to the Karpas donkey, known as a symbol of Cyprus; there are campaigns carried out jointly by Turkish and Greek Cypriots to conserve the rare donkeys of the peninsula.  Activities  Most of the activities in the Karpas Peninsula are related to agriculture, fishing, hunting, and some to micro-tourism. Local farmers take advantage of this natural environment to grow different fruits and vegetables mostly as sub- subsistence farming (although for local commerce too). The region is mostly known for its karpuz (Turkish for \\"watermelon\\"). Several tourist businesses can be found in the town of Rizokarpaso. These are generally restaurants serving traditional Turkish-Cypriot Cuisine, including meze. Due to its geographical position, the Karpas Peninsula is somewhat protected from human interference. This makes it a pristine natural environment, home to many inland and marine species. When hunting season starts, the Karpas's forests are a popular location to go hunting for partridges. Meanwhile, the coastal region, with its clear waters, moderate northern currents, and rocky bottom with cave-like structures, is home to two of the most highly valued fish species: the orfoz (dusky grouper) and lahos (Epinepheluses). The price per kilogram of each species ranges from 35-80 Turkish lira, depending on the location and the season. However, fishing rates in the Karpas region and most of North Cyprus dramatically decreased last century because of the use of dynamite. This is why the Zafer Burunu (the tip of the peninsula) is now a protected natural heritage area, where marine species are slowly recovering to healthy population parameters.

The participation rate was 41% (33% of the town's entire population, including those under the voting age ). Over 96% of participating voters cast ballots in favour of independence.

In the context of a competitive program, 'moves in the field' include spirals, spread eagles, Ina Bauers, hydroblading, and similar extended edge moves. In the United States, moves in the field also refers to skill tests consisting of progressively more difficult edge and step patterns. Similar concepts are called field moves in the United Kingdom and skating skills in Canada. Following the abolition of compulsory figures from international competition in 1990, figure skating federations in several countries developed these drills to teach the same elements as compulsory figures within a free skating format. Whereas skaters formerly learned advanced turns such as brackets, rockers, and counters by doing them in compulsory figures, now those elements are taught in the context of standard step sequences with an emphasis on power, carriage, and flow, rather than on tracing precise patterns on the ice. U.S. Figure Skating requires each skater to pass a \\"Moves in the Field\\" test, as well as a free skating or free dance test, in order to qualify for the various levels of competition. Skaters must perform each field move in the specified pattern while demonstrating adequate power, quickness, edge control, and extension throughout the pattern to be accepted into the level.

After the 1054 Great Schism, the Church of Bulgaria remained in communion with the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople and other Eastern Orthodox Churches.

The show featured such entertainers as Richard Andreoli, Kelsey Grammer, Sandra Bernhard, Diahann Carroll, Susan Saint James, Bruce Vilanch, Marc Cherry, Lynda Carter, Bob Mackie, Jean Smart, Jason Stuart, Frank DeCaro, Barbara Eden, Mike Gray, Carson Kressley, Rue McClanahan, Judy Gold, Thom Filicia, and Mario Cantone. Tickled Pink was produced for TV Land by Linda Ellerbee‚Äôs Lucky Duck Productions. Shows cited in Tickled Pink In addition to The Golden Girls, Batman, and CHiPs, Maude, Xena: Warrior Princess, Will & Grace, Sex & the City, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Designing Women, Friends, Ellen, The Simpsons, The Odd Couple, Laverne & Shirley, Cagney & Lacey, Kate & Allie, Wonder Woman, Dynasty, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer were also cited in Tickled Pink as shows that \\"became ‚Äòhomosensational‚Äô \\", providing gays with characters who were depicted as \\"strong, independent and outrageous\\" and whose \\"bond with their friends resonated with their own lives\\". According to NPR, the first shows to earn the honor were actresses from the 1970s, who may not have been gay but broke away from the happy homemaker mold that defined too many adult female roles in the medium's early years. \\"Mary Tyler Moore\\" fit the bill; so did \\"Maude,\\" another 1970s sitcom starring Bea Arthur as the outspoken title character.'Tickled Pink': Gay-Friendly TV Through the Years, by Andrew Wallenstein, NPR Day to Day, June 1, 2005, http://n.pr/QREMSr  Gay and lesbian subtext  According to producers and critics as well as fans of television shows that are perceived to have a sexually ambiguous or homosexual theme, such shows rely upon a subtext created through double entendres, situational irony, intentional ambiguity, and straightforward gay couplings.  Xena and Gabrielle  According to Liz Friedman, producer of Xena: Warrior Princess, the show‚Äôs writers played on the ambiguous relationship between Xena and her traveling companion, Gabrielle: \\"One episode starts with the camera looking at some bushes,\\" Friedman, herself a lesbian, explains. \\"We hear Gabrielle asking, ‚ÄòHow was that?‚Äô Xena answers, ‚ÄòVery nice!‚Äô Gabrielle says, ‚ÄòReally? I wasn‚Äôt sure,‚Äô and Xena replies, ‚ÄòNo, no, you‚Äôre doing great.‚Äô Then we see them, [a]nd they‚Äôre fishing‚Äînaked!\\" \\"They‚Äôre such a perfect little butch-femme couple.\\" However, the intent is not to affirm or to deny Xena‚Äôs lesbianism; rather, the show maintains an ambiguous position with regard to this question, Friedman declares, \\"the whole point behind subtext is that people can enjoy the show however they wish\\".  Oscar and Felix  According to some critics, the television situation comedy The Odd Couple, starring Jack Klugman and Tony Randall, also played upon the ambiguity of \\"two divorced, heterosexual men sharing a Manhattan apartment, where they cooked, cleaned (or refused to clean), bickered, and negotiated the dilemmas of everyday existence together,\\" and \\"Randall‚Äôs uptight, opera-loving Felix\\" may have \\"functioned as a ‚Äòstealth gay stereotype‚Äô in the still-closeted world of '70s prime time.\\" Alternatively, some critics contend, \\"if slobhood is code for heterosexuality and neatness for homosexuality (a trope that persists today in shows like Queer Eye for the Straight Guy), The Odd Couple might be read as an unconsummated love story between a straight and a gay man.\\" Even during the airing of the show, executive producer, Garry Marshall, remembers that Midwestern focus groups were turned off by The Odd Couple because \\"they thought it was about homosexuals,\\" and Klugman says that the show‚Äôs outtake reels contain \\"a lot of scenes of us kissing and hugging... because the network was concerned people thought Oscar and Felix were gay, and we were trying to make them nervous\\".  Wonder Woman and her Amazon tribe  Wonder Woman has long been popular among lesbians because the character lives in an all-female society of Amazons and bests men in combat. Wonder Woman repeats are scheduled for frequent broadcast on France‚Äôs \\"first [television] station aimed at homosexuals\\".  Batman and Robin  According to George Clooney, Batman is gay. In an interview with Barbara Walters, Clooney said that, as Batman, he wore \\"a rubber suit\\" with \\"rubber nipples\\" and, although he \\"could have played Batman straight,\\" he preferred to portray the character as being homosexual. The portrayal of Batman as gay could have derived from psychiatrist Fredric Wertham‚Äôs 1954 observations about the comic book character and his partner, Robin the Boy Wonder.

It was established in 1860 in Grenoble, France but relocated to Concorezzo, Italy in 1865. It is currently headquartered in Monza, Italy. The company sells products to both individuals and hospitality clientele. It has 9 retail locations in the United States, 25 in Asia, and many more around the world. In 1999, the descendants of the company's founders ceded the company to an Italian fashion group. History Jean Baptiste Ennemonde (Edmond) Chavasse Frette was born on 12 June 1838, in Grenoble, France, from Jean Claude Chavasse Frette, a fabric dyer, merchant and manufacturer of socks and knitted shirts, and Marie Mar√©chal. After her husband's death, in 1840, Marie took up the activity of millinery to support her children. Frette Heritage 1860 On 1 December 1860, Edmond Frette--together with Charles Chaboud and Alexandre Payre--established \\"Frette, Payre & Chaboud\\", for \\"the commerce and manufacture of fabrics.\\" Charles Chaboud became the financial officer, and Alexandre and Edmond took the roles of traveling merchants. As a traveling merchant, Edmond started in Italy, which was not only an export market but also a source of raw materials. Edmond first established himself in the Versilia area in Tuscany. There, Edmond also met his future wife, the Italian Ersilia Bresciani. Between 1862 and 1863, Edmond Frette arrived in Monza. There, established another branch of the company, and in the second half of the 1860s, Edmond was able to concentrate production under the roofs of his own factories: in Concorezzo, products for the private individuals; in Sovico, coarse products for the large communities (hotels, the army, boarding- schools). The latter production represented by large the most important part of Frette's trade. In 1881, Frette won the Gold Medal Award at the National Exhibition in Milan for the quality of its products, and in that year Frette also became an official \\"Provider to the Royal House.\\" Sales by mail catalog began in 1886, which was important at the time since most of Italy's population was agricultural, and a great part of the population lived far away from the big towns that had shops. Frette's mail catalog business ran for 90 years, and the last mail-order catalog was issued in 1976. Frette opened a store in Rome (1887) and, shortly later, in Turin (1889). Frette later opened stores in Genoa (1902) and Florence (1904). On August 29, 1909, Edmond Frette died at age 71. Until 1999, Frette was owned by the descendants of Edmond Frette's Italian backers, Giuseppe Maggi and Carlo Antonietti. That year, it was sold to the financial company Fin.part.

Up until September 2006, Sunshine Express Airlines provided daily services to the airport from Brisbane. The airline ceased all scheduled operations on 1 October 2006 after a proposed acquisition by Regional Express Airlines was terminated and an intention by QantasLink for the introduction of Brisbane services was announced. In 2006, the airport was the fastest growing in Queensland with passenger numbers almost doubling. Currently, plans are underway to further upgrade the airport to handle more jet services from other Australian capital cities. These plans involve the extension of the terminal to twice its current size, as well as a new cross runway (smaller than the main runway) to be used for general aviation purposes.

It is situated in the valley of the Tordera river between the ranges of Montseny and Montnegre. The main part of the town is on the left bank of the river. The former municipalities of Montnegre and Olzinelles now form part of the municipality of sant Celoni, which has the largest area in the comarca. The municipality is served by the AP-7 Motorway and the C-251 road, as well as by a station on the RENFE railway line between Barcelona and Girona.  History  The town of Sant Celoni was named after chapel built towards the 11th century at the foot of the river Perteg√†s. Sant Celoni is the translation from the Latin Sanctum Celedonium and Sancti Celedonii, which refers to Saint Celedonius. There have been many variations on the name through the centuries: Sancti Celidonia, Sant Celdoni, Sent Salony, Sanseloni, San Celoni. Francesc Sabat√© Llopart was killed in Sant Celoni in 1960.  Economy  The agricultural sector has suffered a setback and a loss of importance over the years. The only farming reduces the crop of cereals and fodder. The industry was capitalized on the economic growth of the Sant Celoni. The chemical industry has a strong presence in the town. There are also a large number of industries in the metal and electronics that have experienced strong growth in recent years. The high rate of business growth in the area has encouraged the development of new industrial estates, which in turn have led to the advent of industries that were not originally in the territory. The construction has a strong presence in the area, which has experienced very significant growth in recent years. Sant Celoni remains also an important and modern center of trade, complete with attractive weekly market on Wednesday, attracts many people from the surrounding area. In addition, it has recently built a shopping center with cinemas, bars and restaurants, pubs, supermarket, shops... In 2001, only 1.4% of the population was employed in agriculture, 11.1% in construction, 30.5% in industry and what is more important are the services with 57%.  Demography   Communications  The town of Sant Celoni has good communication links. The AP-7 motorway, the C-35 trunk road, and a railway link Sant Celoni to the rest of Catalonia and France. There is also a reasonable bus network. References * Panareda Clop√©s, Josep Maria; Rios Calvet, Jaume; Rabella Vives, Josep Maria (1989). Guia de Catalunya, Barcelona: Caixa de Catalunya. (Spanish).

She served as a commissioned ship for 13 years.  History  Andromeda was laid down on 22 September 1942 at Kearny, New Jersey, by the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 199); launched on 22 December 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Janet Roper; reclassified an attack cargo ship and redesignated AKA-15 on 1 February 1943; delivered to the Navy on 30 March 1943; and commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 2 April 1943, Comdr. William A. Fly in command. The attack cargo ship made her maiden voyage late in April from New York to Norfolk, Virginia, and then conducted shakedown training in Chesapeake Bay. On 8 June, she put to sea with a convoy bound for the Mediterranean Sea. Andromeda arrived in Mers el Kebir, Algeria, on the 22nd and began training for the Allied invasion of Sicily. On 5 July, the attack cargo ship left Oran, Algeria, with Task Force (TF) 85 and set a course for the southern coast of Sicily. She and her colleagues in Cent Force arrived in the transport area off Scoglitti during the night of the 9th and 10th. Allied troops stormed ashore in the darkness of the early morning hours of the 10th, and Andromeda spent the next two days disgorging her cargo. Late in the evening of the 12th, she departed the area in company with , 10 other auxiliaries, and an escort of nine destroyers. Returning to Oran, Andromeda spent the next few weeks at several locations on the North African coast preparing for another amphibious assault. On 5 September, the attack cargo ship stood out of Mers el Kebir with Task Group (TG) 81.2, the transport group of the Southern Attack Force for the invasion of the Italian mainland just to the southeast of Naples on the shores of the Gulf of Salerno. She arrived at her destination late in the evening of the 8th. Early the next morning, troops of the Army's 36th Division stormed ashore at Salerno. Andromeda remained in the transport area in the gulf until the 10th discharging troops and equipment to fuel the offensive. She departed the area during the last watch of the 10th with a convoy bound for Oran, Algeria. The attack cargo ship anchored in Oran on the morning of the 14th. On the 19th, she headed back to Salerno carrying supplies and reinforcements. Andromeda unloaded at Salerno on the 22nd and the 23rd and then embarked upon the return voyage to Algeria. She arrived at Mers el Kebir on 26 September. The attack cargo ship spent about six weeks practicing amphibious landings with American and Free French troops on the Algerian coast at Mers el Kebir, Oran, and Arzew. Between 5 November and 7 November, she made the passage to Bizerte, Tunisia, where she loaded cargo and embarked troops until the 19th. Departing Bizerte, Andromeda made a six-day stop at Mers el Kebir between 23 November and 29 November and an overnight pause at Oran on the 29th and 30th before joining a convoy bound for the British Isles. The ship visited Belfast in Northern Ireland and several ports in Scotland and then headed across the Atlantic on 18 December. Andromeda arrived in Norfolk, Virginia, on 2 January 1944 and began a yard overhaul on the 3rd. On 13 February and 14 February, the attack cargo ship made the passage to New York. She loaded cargo at New York and then, on 27 February, put to sea with a convoy bound for Europe. She reached Newport in Wales on 9 March and unloaded cargo on the 10th, 11th, and 12th. After visiting several Scottish ports, Andromeda stood out of the River Clyde on 29 March and shaped course for North Africa. The ship reached Mers el Kebir again on 6 April and spent the next two months conducting amphibious training on the Algerian coast between Mers el Kebir and Arzew. On 16 June, the attack cargo ship left the North African coast for the Italian boot. She entered Naples on the 19th and remained there until the 23rd. Steaming by way of Palermo, Sicily, Andromeda made Algiers on 7 July. She loaded cargo and got underway again for Naples on the 8th. Arriving at her destination on 10 July, she divided her time between Naples and the Gulf of Pozzuoli for the rest of the month. Andromeda spent the first part of August in the Bay of Castellamare waiting for the beginning of Operation \\"Dragoon\\", the invasion of southern France. The attack cargo ship left the Bay of Castellamare on 12 August and arrived off the invasion beaches on the 15th. She unloaded her cargo and headed back to Oran on the 16th. For over two months, the ship went back and forth across the Mediterranean Sea carrying supplies and reinforcements from North Africa to the armies operating ashore in southern France. On 25 October 1944, however, she set out from Mers el Kebir to return to the United States. Andromeda arrived in Boston, Mass., on 8 November and commenced a month of repairs on the 9th. After loading cargo at Davisville, R.I., the attack cargo ship put to sea for the journey to the Pacific. Steaming by way of Norfolk, she arrived in the Canal Zone at the end of December, transited the canal on the 31st and resumed her voyage west on New Year's Day 1945. She entered Pearl Harbor on 15 January and began the ubiquitous cargo loading operation. On 24 January, the ship got underway for the southwestern Pacific. She unloaded cargo at Noum√©a, New Caledonia, between 3 February and 7 February and then returned to sea bound for the Solomon Islands. On 10 February, Andromeda arrived at Guadalcanal. She spent the ensuing five weeks in the Solomon Islands carrying out amphibious exercises in preparation for the assault on Okinawa. The attack cargo ship left the Solomons on 15 March bound ultimately for the campaign about to unfold in the Ryukyu Islands. She entered Ulithi Atoll in the Caroline Islands on the 21st and bided her time until the 27th when her portion of the invasion force sortied from the lagoon. Andromeda arrived in the transport area off Okinawa on L-day, 1 April. The soldiers and marines carried out their landing that morning, and support ships like Andromeda began to disgorge supplies and equipment. The attack cargo ship stayed in the vicinity for nine days. During that time, the Japanese launched massive air attacks in an attempt to thwart the offensive. Andromeda went to general quarters time after time to help beat off the aerial onslaught and, on at least one occasion, helped to splash one of the intruders. The attack cargo ship cleared the Ryukyu Islands on 9 April and laid in a course for Hawaii. She pulled into Pearl Harbor on the 24th and loaded cargo until near the middle of May. On 12 May, Andromeda put to sea on her way back to Okinawa. Steaming by way of Eniwetok in the Marshalls and Ulithi in the Carolines, the ship reached Okinawa on 7 June. She stayed there for a week then headed back to Pearl Harbor on the 14th. Andromeda reentered Pearl Harbor on 29 June and then conducted training at Maui before setting a course for the Mariana Islands. She reached Saipan on 28 July and passed a fortnight in the Marianas. Andromeda returned to sea on 11 August, and hostilities ended four days later when she was half the way to the Solomons. She spent the period 18 August to 23 August in the Solomons and returned to the Marianas at Guam on the 30th. During the two months following Japan's surrender, Andromeda carried out two missions to the home islands and made a voyage to Manila in the Philippines. After embarking servicemen at Sasebo, Japan, the attack cargo ship got underway for the United States on 6 November. After a nonstop voyage, she returned to American soil at Seattle, Washington, on 22 November. The ship spent four weeks there before heading south to San Francisco, California, where she arrived on 22 December 1945. Andromeda remained on active duty during the late 1940s and early 1950s. She made cargo runs between the west coast and American bases at such places as Pearl Harbor, Midway, Wake Island, Kwajalein, Guam, and Saipan. In September and October 1949, the attack cargo ship made a round-trip voyage from the West Coast to the East Coast and back. She resumed operations from her base on the west coast upon her return. In August 1950, she voyaged north to the Pribilof Islands and, in March 1951, left the west coast for the Far East. Andromeda provided logistics support for United Nations forces fighting the Korean War until returning to San Diego at the end of the year. After 10 months of duty on the west coast, the ship returned to the Orient and logistics support for the United Nations defense of South Korea. She took up duty along the west coast in the spring of 1953, but interrupted it for a round-trip voyage to Yokosuka, Japan, in August and early September. Andromeda deployed to the Far East in 1954 and participated in Operation Passage to Freedom, the evacuation of refugees from North Vietnam in August and September. The attack cargo ship came back to the west coast from that assignment in October and arrived in San Diego on 20 NovemberAssociated Press, ‚ÄúParade of Navy Ships to Bring Thousands Home From Pacific,‚Äù San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Friday 19 November 1954, Volume LXI, Number 69, page 4. and operated on the Pacific Coast. In June 1955 the ship sailed to Seattle in preparation for the Dewline Operation. On 6 July the ship sailed north to Icy Cape, and when the ice cleared, went around Pt. Barrow and then to her offloading sites as far east as Cape Peary in Amundsen Gulf. During this operation in the ice, the ship broke the palm of her rudder. The ship was evacuated of none essential personnel and towed back to Pt. Barrow where the personnel were backloaded. Andromeda was then tow to Seattle arriving early October. Long gashes in the hull from contact with the ice could not be repaired and the ship was deactivated. Andromeda was placed out of commission at San Diego on 1 May 1956. She was transferred to the Maritime Administration for lay up with the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Olympia, Washington Her name was struck from the Navy List on 1 July 1960, and she was sold to the Marine Power & Equipment Co., of Seattle, Washington, on 12 March 1971.

Ward is best known as a founding member of Stuck Mojo and as lead guitarist of heavy metal band Fozzy. Early life Ward grew up listening to many Indie style soundtracks as that was all that was available to him. After his parents' divorce, Ward's mother's work schedule was hectic, resulting in her hiring a college student to look after him and his sister. According to Ward, the student would often bring over heavy metal and hard rock albums from bands such as AC/DC, Black Sabbath and Iron Maiden, to name a few. From that point, Ward had a new outlook on music, having found the genre of music that \\"clicked\\" with him. Ward has also said in interviews that his favorite band growing up was Journey, and he's also cited bands like Bad Company and Foreigner as influences. Ward began learning guitar at age 12, borrowing weekends from a friend's guitar, practicing different chords he picked up from his friends.http://journeyofafrontman.com/2014/05/14/sit-down-series-rich-ward-of- fozzy/ Early career In 1989, Ward formed Stuck Mojo along with bassist Duane Fowler and front man Bonz. The first six years of the band consisted of touring clubs on the East Coast of the United States. When recalling this time of his life, Ward speaks of sleeping in his rehearsal space to save money. After finally receiving a recording contract with Century Media Records, Mojo released its debut album Snappin' Necks in 1995. Although the album found little mainstream success, it went on to influence many popular Nu metal bands of today, such as Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit. In 1996, in preparation for their first overseas tour, the band released the European-only EP, Violated. That same year, Stuck Mojo released its second album, Pigwalk. Even though the band's second full-length album sold in similar numbers as the previous one, many critics and musicians consider this album to be a defining milestone of rap-metal. In 1998, Stuck Mojo released Rising, its commercially most successful release. From its beginnings, the band went through a number of lineup changes. As time went on, tensions within the group mounted, primarily between Ward and Bonz. Ward has stated in interviews that it once escalated to the point of a physical confrontation between the two while on tour in Europe. At one point, they weren't even talking to each other, only having one common goal, the success of the band. In 2000, Stuck Mojo released Declaration of a Headhunter. The band had slowly been crumbling during the process of recording and releasing the album. Ward recalled, \\"That album was basically done with duct tape, we didn't even have a working band.\\" The bands' relationship with Century Media, both mutual and business, had also been deteriorating, to the point where Ward disbanded the band a while after releasing the album. Post Stuck Mojo In 1999, Ward formed Sick Speed with singer and guitarist Dale Steele, Mojo bassist Dan Dryden and Mojo drummer Frank \\"Bud\\" Fontsere. The same year, Ward met World Wrestling Entertainment (then known as the World Wrestling Federation, or WWF) superstar Chris Jericho backstage at a WWF show. The two bonded over their love of 1980s heavy metal and Ward invited Jericho to join his side band Fozzy Osbourne which would later transform into the \\"mock rock\\" band Fozzy. While the band was originally supposed to be just a fun side project, the band was courted by Metal Blade Records and filmed a \\"mockumentary\\" that aired on MTV. The show provided a fictional back story about the band, alleging that the members of Fozzy had in fact written many of the more popular 1980s metal songs, but that an unfair contract had forced the band to remain in Japan for the past 20 years, allowing other acts to take credit for the compositions. Jericho went by the alter ego of \\"Moongoose McQueen\\" and adamantly denied that McQueen and Jericho were the same person. Fozzy's first two albums, Fozzy and Happenstance mainly consisted of covers of the songs of 1970s and 1980s metal bands. Their third album, All That Remains, consisted entirely of originals, although two of the songs, \\"The Test\\" and \\"The Way I Am\\", had been written by Ward during his time with Sick Speed, which disbanded in 2004. The reason for releasing a completely original album was noted by Ward, \\"Ultimately it came to the time of the third album that we had to decide what we are, we're either a joke or we're a really good joke with good songs\\". In early 2005, performing under the stage name \\"The Duke\\", Ward released My Kung Fu is Good, his debut solo album with Spitfire Records, which grew from demos he had recorded the previous year and performances at the Atlantis Music Conference in Atlanta, Ga. The album received positive reviews, with Billboard magazine stating, \\"Evolution and growth that exceeds most of the rock acts currently cluttering the airwaves.\\" In 2011, he joined metal supergroup Adrenaline Mob playing rhythm guitar, but he left in early 2012 to focus on other projects. Stuck Mojo Reunion Ward reformed Stuck Mojo with Bonz and Fontsere in 2005, alongside new bassist Sean Delson. Ward stated that he and Bonz had patched things up over recent years and regained the desire to want to write and release records. Mojo started a tour of Europe and then of the U.S. However, the reunion with Bonz only lasted into early 2006, when the band approached Bonz with an ultimatum; either enter a substance abuse rehabilitation program or he would be forced to leave the group. Substance abuse is attributed to the previously damaged relationship between Ward and Bonz, who often mentioned marijuana in the band's live shows. Bonz responded with a compromise that he would work on the addiction himself. Ward cited this as too big a risk, fueled by the then-recent deaths of other musicians in metal bands. Bonz left the band and was replaced by his friend, Lord Nelson. Stuck Mojo today is known most for their 2006 song \\"Open Season\\", which sparked controversy in the American media in general. \\"Open Season\\" is part of the album that Bonz and Ward had originally collaborated on in the reformation of Stuck Mojo, Southern Born Killers. Due to Bonz' sudden departure from the band, Ward re-recorded the album with vocalist Lord Nelson, guitarist Mike Martin, bassist Sean Delson and drummer Eric Sanders (Frank Fontsere departed in December 2005). In early 2008, Stuck Mojo signed with Napalm Records and re-released Southern Born Killers along with three new tracks. The album was released internationally on February 29, 2008, and on March 4, 2008, in the U.S. In late 2008, the band released \\"The Great Revival\\" overseas, and in the United States, it was released on January 13, 2009. Some critics disliked the direction of the album, and reviews were mixed. In 2015 Ward stated on his website that he had begun writing demos for a new Stuck Mojo release. In March 2016 via Blabbermouth.Com Stuck Mojo announced the release via PledgeMusic.comStuck Mojo Pledge Music Page, March 25, 2016 their seventh studio album titled \\"Here Come The Infidels\\". Along with the new album Stuck Mojo announced the new band's lineup of Ward, Frank Fontsere and new members, Robby J. and Len Sonnier. Personal life Ward was previously married to professional wrestler Daffney. He has since remarried and he and his wife Julie live in the Atlanta area.

They belong to the myrtle family Myrtaceae and have flowers similar to those of the tea-trees (Leptospermum). The most well-known species is the Geraldton Wax, Chamelaucium uncinatum, which is cultivated widely for its large attractive flowers. Description Plants of the genus Chamelaucium are woody evergreen shrubs ranging from 15 cm (6 in) to 3 m (10 ft) high. The leaves are tiny to medium-sized and arranged oppositely on the stems. They contain oil glands and are aromatic, often giving off a pleasant aroma when crushed. The flowers are small and have five petals, ten stamens, and are followed by small hardened fruit. Taxonomy The genus was first defined by French botanist Ren√© Louiche Desfontaines in 1819. The derivation of the name is unclear. They are commonly known as waxplants, or wax flowers from the waxy feel of the petals. Fourteen species are currently recognised within the genus. It gives its name to a number of closely related genera, collectively known as the Chamelaucium alliance within the family Myrtaceae; larger members include Verticordia, Calytrix, Darwinia, Micromyrtus, Thryptomene and Baeckea. Species Species include: *Chamelaucium axillare F.Muell. ex Benth. - Esperance waxflower *Chamelaucium brevifolium Benth. *Chamelaucium ciliatum Desf. *Chamelaucium confertiflorum Domin *Chamelaucium drummondii (Turcz.)

Domin *Chamelaucium pauciflorum (Turcz.) Benth. *Chamelaucium uncinatum Schauer - Geraldton waxflower, Geraldton wax *Chamelaucium virgatum Endl. Distribution and habitat Restricted to the southwest of Western Australia, Chamelaucium species grow most commonly in heathland communities growing on sand near the coast or inland, and in granite outcrops. Some grow in more semi arid climates. Cultivation In cultivation, they do well in dryer climates with good drainage and sunny aspect. They are hardy to frost and drought, although sensitive to Phytophthora cinnamomi. The best known and most widely cultivated member of the genus by far is C. uncinatum, which is widely grown in gardens across southern Australia, and for the cut flower industry in the USA and Israel.

It consists of several large masses of shale rock, piled one on the other, that overlook the Shenandoah River just prior to its confluence with the Potomac River. The name of this landmark derives from Thomas Jefferson, who stood there on unknown date while writing his book on Virginia. He found the view from the rock impressive and wrote in Notes on the State of Virginia: > \\"The passage of the Potomac through the Blue Ridge is perhaps one of the > most stupendous scenes in Nature. You stand on a very high point of land. On > your right comes up the Shenandoah, having ranged along the foot of the > mountain a hundred miles to seek a vent. On your left approaches the Potomac > in quest of a passage also. In the moment of their junction they rush > together against the mountain, rend it asunder and pass off to the sea. The > first glance of this scene hurries our senses into the opinion that this > earth has been created in time, that the mountains were formed first, that > the rivers began to flow afterwards, that in this place particularly they > have been so dammed up by the Blue Ridge of mountains as to have formed an > ocean which filled the whole valley; that, continuing to rise, they have at > last broken over at this spot and have torn the mountain down from its > summit to its base. The piles of rock on each hand, but particularly on the > Shenandoah, the evident marks of their disruptions and avulsions from their > beds by the most powerful agents in nature, corroborate the impression. \\"But > the distant finishing which nature has given the picture is of a very > different character. It is a true contrast to the former. It is as placid > and delightful as that is wild and tremendous. For the mountains being > cloven asunder, she presents to your eye, through the cleft, a small catch > of smooth blue horizon, at an infinite distance in that plain country, > inviting you, as it were, from the riot and tumult roaring around to pass > through the breach and participate in the calm below. Here the eye > ultimately composes itself; and that way, too, the road happens actually to > lead. You cross the Potomac above the junction, pass along its side through > the base of the mountain for three miles, the terrible precipice hanging in > fragments over you, and within about 20 miles reach Frederic-town and the > fine country around that. This scene is worth a voyage across the Atlantic.\\" The uppermost slab of Jefferson Rock originally rested on a natural stone foundation so narrow that one was able to sway the rock back and forth with a gentle push. Because this natural foundation had \\"dwindled to very unsafe dimensions by the action of the weather, and still more, by the devastation of tourists and curiosity-hunters,\\" four stone pillars were placed under each corner of the uppermost slab sometime between 1855 and 1860.

Louvre. Details of a head in the scene above Scythian archer, running while looking backwards and pulling an arrow from his quiver, cup, circa 520/500 BC. British Museum. Epiktetos was an Attic vase painter in the early red-figure style. Besides Oltos, he was the most important painter of the Pioneer Group. He was active between 520 BC and 490 BC. His name translates as \\"newly acquired\\" which is most probably a reference to his slave status.The Getty Museum - Biography of Epiktetos  Artistic Career  At the beginning of his career, Epiktetos painted a chalice krater made by the potter Andokides, but later he turned to smaller vessels, such as cups and plates. Throughout his long career, he worked for a variety of potters, including Andokides, Hischylos and the Nikosthenes-Pamphaios workshop. Since he signed one plate as painter and potter, he may have carried out both functions at least for some of the time. That plate was a votive offering, dedicated on the Athenian Acropolis. On one kylix, he collaborated with the Euergides Painter. He appears to have been aware of his talent, as he signed more than half of the works ascribed to him. His first vases were bilingual eye-cups. Already at this stage, he was technically superior to the early works of Oltos, and omitted out-of-date features such as palmette- hearts. He also used the relief-line technique. Epiktetos was considered a master of the tondo (circular image inside a cup). Often his vases were only painted on the inside. His miniature drawings were delicate and precise. His use of colour and ornament was careful and controlled. His lines and details were very balanced, with heads and limbs well-proportioned. His use of perspective on figures was very convincing. John Beazley praised Epiktetos: \\"it is not possible to draw better, only to draw differently\\". John Boardman also lauded him as the \\"greatest draughtsman in early red-figure vase painting\\".Boardman: Rotfigurige Vasen aus Athen. Die archaische Zeit, p. 67. He preferred scenes of daily life and revelry to mythological scenes. He rarely depicted mythological scenes, which usually lacked originality. In contrast, his everyday scenes demonstrated his skills and his innovative ideas. He showed Athenian citizens at play, at the symposion and in erotic scenes, where he develops new aspects and motifs. He played an important role in the development of the satyr as a figure expressing beast like masculinity. His tondi ceased to depict the kneeling runner characteristic of black-figure vase painting; instead his figures squat, kneel or were seated. In some cases, the postures of figures depicted on his vases were nearly identical, even if their actions varied greatly. For example, a bent and twisted figure was in one case the Minotaur. Komast with a skyphos, a staff and pipes case, tondo from a red-figure plate by Epiktetos, ca. 520s BCE‚Äì500s BCE, from Vulci, Cabinet des M√©dailles (n.510). The end of his career remains unclear. One of his last works was on a cup by the potter Python ‚Äì here he appeared stylistically influenced by Python's main painter, Douris ‚Äì another on a vase by Pistoxenos. Epiktetos's work must have been greatly appreciated at the time, as indicated by a pelike by the Kleophrades Painter which was twice falsely signed Epiktetos egraphsen (Epiktetos painted it). The signature was a forgery, suggesting that the vessel was considered more marketable if considered to be by Epiktetos.  Bibliography  * John Beazley: Attic red- figure vase-painters, 2nd ed.

History It was probably situated at the boundary of Lycia and Caria, for it is placed in the former territory by Ptolemy (xxxi, 16), in the latter by Stephanus Byzantius. Stephanus gives also another form of the name, Karynda. Calynda must be carefully distinguished from Kalydna, Kalydnos, Karyanda and Kadyanda. Strabo places it 60 stadia from the sea, west of the Gulf of Glaucus, and east of Caunus. It appears, from a passage in Herodotus,i. 172 that the territory of Caunus bordered on that of Calynda. Its king, Damasithymos, was an ally of Queen Artemisia I of Caria, and was at the Battle of Artemisium and the Battle of Salamis with a ship on the side of Xerxes.Herodotus, VIII, lxxxvii. Calynda was afterwards, as it appears from Polybius, subject to Caunus; but having revolted from Caunus, it placed itself under the protection of the Rhodians. Pliny writes its name Calydna.V, xxvii. It is mentioned among the cities that struck coins in the Roman period. Its site is located near Kozpƒ±nar, Asiatic Turkey. Bishopric The diocese is not mentioned in the Notitiae episcopatuum, but we know that it was at a certain time a suffragan of Myra, the metropolis of Lycia, for Bishop Leontius of Calynda is mentioned in 458 in the letter of the Lycian bishops to the Byzantine Emperor Leo I the Thracian about the death of Proterius of Alexandria.Michel Lequien, Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus, Paris 1740, Vol. I, coll. 991-992Pius Bonifacius Gams, Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae, Leipzig 1931, p. 450 No longer a residential bishopric, Calynda is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 856 References Sources  Populated places in ancient Caria Populated places in ancient Lycia Ancient Greek archaeological sites in Turkey Former populated places in Turkey Catholic titular sees in Asia History of Muƒüla Province ","title":"Calynda"},{"id":"6412361","text":"Paul Mayo (born 13 October 1981) is an English former professional footballer, who played as a defender from 1999 to 2014.

He returned to Lincoln in 2005 and moved on to Notts County in 2007 and later Darlington and Mansfield Town. He became a prime example of a promising player who peaked early on in his career and went on to play in Non-league football with Corby Town, Gainsborough Trinity, Stamford and Boston United. He finished his playing career with Lincoln United during the 2013‚Äì14 season. Career Lincoln City Mayo was educated in Lincolnshire at Robert Pattinson School. He started his career at Lincoln City, playing over 100 times for the club and featuring in their Division Three play-off semi-final defeat to Bournemouth in the 2002‚Äì03 season. Whilst in his first spell with the club Mayo made a name for himself while under the management tenure of Keith Alexander. Watford In March 2004 he was signed by Division One side Watford for ¬£65,000. Replacing Paul Robinson, who had been sold to West Brom the previous autumn, he played regularly for the remainder of the 2003‚Äì04 season.

He subsequently joined Conference side Mansfield Town on a contract until the end of 2008‚Äì09 season. Move into Non league In the summer of 2009 Conference North side Corby Town came in for him. Mayo left the club at the end of the season. In May 2010 he signed for Gainsborough Trinity but after a disappointing season in which the club narrowly avoided relegation to the Northern Premier League he was amongst a group of players released in May 2011.

Born in Tehran, Iran, he emigrated to Washington D.C. at the age of 14. A mainstay of the Washington underground dance music scene, he has been active both as one half of the duo Deep Dish and solo artist, producer and mixer. As part of Deep Dish, with Ali \\"Dubfire\\" Shirazinia, Sharam released two albums and produced or remixed a library of other releases including those from Janet Jackson, Stevie Nicks, Rolling Stones as well as others. The duo received a Grammy nomination for their remix of Madonna's \\"Music\\" and won the \\"Best Remixed Recording\\" Grammy for their remix of Dido's \\"Thank You.‚Äù Deep Dish were nominated two times for their George Is On album‚ÄîBest Single (\\"Say Hello\\") and Best Remix (\\"Flashdance\\" remixed by David Guetta). As a solo artist, Sharam released two of his own albums and six mix compilations and produced or mixed fourteen other artists such as Bruno Mars, Coldplay, Steve Aoki, Shakira and more. Sharam is known for his house hits ‚ÄúParty All the Time‚Äù, \\"The One\\" with Daniel Bedingfield, \\"Don‚Äôt Say A Word\\" with Anousheh, \\"She Came Along\\" with Kid Cudi, ‚ÄúMy Way‚Äù featuring Honey Honey and more. Also in 2009, Sharam won BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix of the Year picked from 52 other mixes by his peers.  Early life and history  Sharam Tayebi was born in Iran and at age 14, he and his family settled in Washington D.C. It was in this city that he discovered dance music and developed skills as a producer, DJ and musician. Back in the 1990s of Washington, DC, Sharam Tayebi met Ali \\"Dubfire\\" Shirazinia, also an Iranian immigrant, and together in 1992 formed Deep Dish. Their music was a mix of deep house and techno, with industrial and rock influences. The two formed an eponymous record label as well as Yoshitoshi Records and, upon meeting Danny Tenagia, released their music and imprints on Tribal America label. Sharam Tayebi remains a mainstay of the Washington underground music scene, and \\"has been an instrumental figure in house and techno music as a DJ, producer and one-half of the duo, Deep Dish,\\"according to DJ Tech Tools.  Career  1995‚Äì2004: Deep Dish  As Deep Dish, Sharam and his musical partner Dubfire released their debut album, Penetrate Deeper in 1995. Three years later came Junk Science, featuring a collaboration with Everything But The Girl's Tracey Thorn. This track, called \\"Future of the Future (Stay Gold) debuted on the UK charts at #37. Between 1999 and 2003, Deep Dish released six DJ mix compilations including:Cream Separates, Yoshiesque, Global Underground Moscow, Yoshiesque 2, Renaissance Ibiza and Global Underground Toronto. 2004‚Äì2006: George Is On  On July 12, 2005, Deep Dish released George Is On, which became their last album together for years. The album was proceeded by the single, \\"Flashdance,\\" which went to #3 in the UK, and remained in the Top 10 for four weeks in 2004. Two other singles, \\"Say Hello\\" and \\"Dreams\\" with Stevie Nicks both debuted at 14 in the UK. George Is On and its singles were nominated for three Grammy Awards including Best Electronic Album, Best Single for \\"Say Hello\\" and Best Remix (David Guetta's remix of \\"Flashdance\\"). 2006‚Äì2009: post-Deep Dish  Sharam split from Dubfire and Deep Dish in 2006, and launched his solo career with the release of his own Global Underground mix compilation Dubai GU29 on October 17. Sharam toured North America prior to the street date of GU29. That same year, Sharam also released ‚ÄúP.A.T.T. (Party All The Time),‚Äù a cover of the Eddie Murphy and Rick James hit from 1985. His version contained vocals by P. Diddy. The track became the most sought-after record of 2006 Winter Music Conference in Miami, as well as one of the biggest club records of the year. It debuted in the UK national charts at #8 on New Year's Eve 2006, stayed in the top 10 for 3 weeks and remained in the top 40 for 8 weeks. 2009‚Äì2014: Get Wild and Night & Day  On May 5, 2009, Sharam's single, \\"She Came Along\\", led off his solo album, Get Wild which hit stores February 17, 2009. The song, featuring American hip-hop recording artist Kid Cudi, became a Top 20 international hit. Get Wild was a concept album inspired by Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns, featured Daniel Bedingfield, Public Enemy‚Äôs Chuck D, and M√∂tley Cr√ºe‚Äôs Tommy Lee, and rose up the US club charts. Its release coincided with an international tour which took Sharam to locations such as Australia. That double album consisted of 24 originally produced tracks mixed together like a compilation. Next, from his Mach EP series, a series of tracks were released, the two most notable being ‚ÄúM.I.T.T.‚Äù with Shakira and ‚ÄúFun‚Äù written by Chris Martin of Coldplay. Sharam released Live from Warung, Brazil in 2011, a compilation featuring a live set from Itajay, Brazil. The mix was first featured on BBC Radio 1's Essential Mix before being released as this compilation. On July 17, 2012, five years after his last mix compilation, Sharam released a two-disc set called Night and Day. Based on the concept that people want to listen to music at different times‚Äîa dance party at night; a pool party during the day‚Äîthe mix compilation took a ‚Äúbig festival‚Äù and ‚Äúsmall club‚Äù approach. 2014‚Äì2016: Deep Dish reunion, Spinnin' Deep and Retroactive  In 2014, Sharam and Dubfire reunited Deep Dish, playing gigs in selected cities and recording new material, at the same time maintaining their solo work. Their first, new joint release in eight years was the single, \\"Quincy,\\" which came out March 31, 2014 and musically reflected the diverse paths these two took in their hiatus. Two years later, Sharam released his next solo album, Retroactive. Originally entitled A Warehouse, with its new title, the album debuted on the iTunes Dance Top 10 on its release day June 10, 2016. Paying homage to his musical history and influences from as far back as the '80s to the drum 'n bass of today, Sharam featured songs with collaborators like disco producer Giorgio Moroder, singer- songwriter Daniel Bedingfield, frequent vocal collaborator Anousheh, Chance Caspian and Alex Neri. The single, \\"August House\\" was released 2015 on Spinnin' Deep Records, with \\"August Dub\\" superseding it that month. The followup, \\"October House\\" was released that month on Spinnin' Deep, with \\"Octodub\\" following on Yoshitoshi Records. In conjunction with his new album, Sharam hit the road for the \\"Retroactive Tour,\\" beginning in San Diego in June and finishing in San Antonio at the end of August. Planned stops also include Mexico and Canada and is followed by a show in Ibiza, Spain. 2017: Collecti In 2017, Sharam released Collecti, an album that marked a return to his techno-influenced roots. The album was released throughout the summer as three separate EP's each containing four original tracks, followed by a full album with a DJ mix version and bonus content in October. Collecti debuted in the Top 20 on iTunes Dance chart and showcased a total of fifteen original tracks, some of which were compiled from previous releases but most of which were created for the album. Sharam said of the album's creation: \\"These records are my dance floor experiments, my secret weapons, tracks that have been driving my sets.\\" The album was followed by a tour that included dates in Europe and North America and a free master class at Los Angeles's IO Academy, where Sharam talked with students about the creation and production of some of the tracks on Collecti. Of Collecti Billboard wrote: \\"Collecti (Part 3) consists of four pulsating cuts that lean more Detroit than Berlin and exhibit hypnotic percussion patterns alongside head-bobbing grooves.\\" Mixmag said that the album's track \\"Melodi\\" was, \\"a sophisticated, swelling tune that bounces from stripped back rises to bass-driven breakdowns.\\" Discography Studio albums * Get Wild (2009) * Retroactive (2016) * Collecti (2017) Compilations * Cream Separates (1997) * Global Underground: Toronto (2003) * Global Underground: Dubai (2006) * Live at Warung Beach Brasil (2011) * Night & Day(2012) * Yoshitoshi Ibiza (2016) Singles * \\"PATT\\" (Party All The Time) (2006) * \\"The One\\" feat.

It involved a tripling of Israeli forces inside Lebanon and aimed at encircling Hizbullah forces in south Lebanon. The plan was to advance westwards along the Litani River from the Galilee Panhandle, combined with helicopter landings behind enemy lines, intended to be the largest in IDF history, and simultaneous advances northwards in the central sector and along the Mediterranean coast. The plan was to follow up the offensive by several weeks of mopping-up operations in the surrounded territories, eliminating Hizbullah infrastructure, especially in the launching areas of Katyusha rockets. The offensive was called off halfway due to heavy casualties and the implementation of the UN ceasefire.Harel and Issacharoff (2008), p. 235 At least 33 Israeli officers and soldiers were killed and over 400 were wounded, an Israeli Air Force (IAF) helicopter was shot down and scores of Israeli tanks were damaged. The IDF never reached the Litani river and failed to surround Hizbullah forces in South Lebanon. Instead the Israeli government on August 13, accepted a ceasefire in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1701. When the ceasefire commenced the following day IDF found itself in control of 16 different pockets or sectors in South Lebanon, often isolated from each other and from Israeli territory. IDF expressed a desire to withdraw from these positions as quickly as possible, as soon as a ceasefire agreement was in place. Hizbullah remained in control of both Bint Jbeil and Ayta ash-Sha'b, close to the border, while IDF soldiers were operating well to the north of both these towns.Matthews pp. 47 The Plan According to the plan Brig. Gen. Eyal Eisenberg‚Äôs Reserve 98th Paratrooper Division would be airlifted to the central sector, south of the Litani river, in what was envisioned as the largest airlift in IDF history. Brig. Gen. Gal Hirsch‚Äôs 91st Division would proceed north and link up with Eisenberg‚Äôs forces. Brig. Gen. Guy Tzur‚Äôs 162nd Armored Division would cross the Sulouqi/Hujeir river from the east along the Litani and sweep west and link up with the other IDF forces at Juwwiya. With the exception of the city of Tyre the entire South Lebanon, south of the Litani river, would then be effectively surrounded by Israeli forces.Harel and Issacharoff (2008), p. 194 Brig. Gen. Erez Zuckerman' 366th Division was assigned to capture al-Khiyam and the adjoining areas from where rocket fire was directed at Northern Israel. The Israeli government was initially determined to continue the fighting in spite of the Security Council resolution's call for a cease-fire by 8 AM August 14. The IDF command had asked for at least a full month of fighting to complete the mission; one week to capture the territory south of the Litani, two to four weeks for mopping-up operations and another week for the exit. When the operation was finally launched IDF had only 60 hours before the ceasefire would eventually commence.Harel and Issacharoff (2008), p. 209 IDF Chief of Staff Dan Halutz said the IDF would fight until the ceasefire was implemented. Israeli Government officials claimed that IDF operations would not stop \\"until the army's goals were reached, despite the passage of UN Security Council resolution 1701.\\" The battles in the North The fighting in the north was formally not part of Operation Change of Direction 11 but were preparatory steps for its implementation. On the night of August 8, units belonging to the reserve brigade of the 366th Division (Pillar of Fire Formation), under the command of Brigadier General Erez Zuckerman, advanced northward and reached the Christian town of Marj‚Äôayoun, 9 kilometers from the border. The Israeli forces initially did not encounter any resistance and there were no clashes inside the town. It appears that a secular leftist party (probably the SSNP) aligned to Hezbullah eventually offered some resistance. Fighting erupted outside Marj'ayoun and the nearby Shiite town of al-Khiyam. A supply convoy was hit by missiles. Israeli media reported that IDF forces began August 8, operating \\"in al-Khiam\\", from where a large number of rockets were being fired at northern Galilee. The day after the Israeli Cabinet finally approved the advance towards the Litani. On August 10, an Israeli tank belonging to the 366th Division got stuck near the Christian town of al-Qulay‚Äôah, facing the Shi‚Äôite town of al-Khiyam, on the other side of the valley. A column of tanks that came to its rescue were targeted by Hizbullah missiles. Several tanks took hits and seven soldiers were injured, four of them seriously. The entire battalion got involved in the rescue mission, after which the battalion promptly returned to Israeli territory, ignoring orders to continue the advance towards Marj'ayoun. Apparently the battalion commander‚Äôs tank was left stranded in the town with only an APC to back him up. The brigade commander was therefore relieved of his command after the war. The unit became known after the war as \\"the brigade that ran away.\\" Another battalion commander from the same brigade was ordered into Lebanon to assist in the evacuation of the trapped units. He expressed his reservations about advancing in broad daylight and asked to be relieved of his command. One of the tank crew members later wrote about his experience. The tank company was attacking al-Khiyam at nighttime, circling it and firing into the town when one of the tanks broke down. It had to be towed by a second tank back to Israel, approximately 7 kilometers away. The two tanks could only move by five kilometers an hour and failed to reach Israeli territory before dawn. Both tanks were hit by Kornet missiles that hit the tanks in exactly the same spot, the engine grille and both were penetrated. One of the crew members were killed. Both tanks started burning and were abandoned. The tank crews hid in a ditch before being evacuated by APC's more than an hour later. Anthony Shadid reported that Hezbullah fighters claimed to have hit and damaged up to a dozen Israeli tanks outside al-Khiyam. The 366th Division does not seem to have resumed offensive action for the duration of the war and never completed the missions assigned to it.Final Winograd Report, p. 383 Uri Bar-Yosef described the two-day stand- off as \\"one of the most humiliating operations in the history of the Israel Defense Forces.\\" A two-day stand-off between an Israeli armored division and an ‚Äúhandful of Hezbollah fighters‚Äù. A few months after the war Brig.-Gen. Erez Zuckerman told the IDF Chief of Staff \\"I have failed, and I resign.\\" The Marj‚Äôayoun tea party The Marj'ayoun garrison of troops from the Lebanese Internal Security Forces did not resist the IDF occupation. The commander General Adnan Daoud invited Israeli soldiers for tea and let them inspect the base. The Israeli troops were accompanied by an Israeli TV team. The pictures of the \\"Marj'ayoun tea party\\" were broadcast on Israeli television and soon also on Hizbullah TV channel al-Manar. The scandal lead to General Daoud being placed in house arrest. An hour after the departure of the Israeli soldiers, four Israeli tanks drove up to the gate of the barracks and blasted the gate. The 350 Lebanese soldiers surrendered without a fight and were disarmed and taken prisoners. The Lebanese soldiers were later released and allowed to evacuate the town. The evacuation convoy was joined by hundreds of cars with civilians, mainly Christians wanting to leave the battle zone. Although the evacuation convoy was coordinated with IDF through UNIFIL it was targeted by an air strike killing of at least seven people. The deployment of the Lebanese army in \\"all of Southern Lebanon\\" was one of several ambitious targets set by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in his speech in the Knesset on July 17, 2006. It was also one of the cornerstones of the resolution being finalized at the same time in Security Council.UN Security Council Resolution 1701 On August 17, the Lebanese army returned to the barracks of Marj‚Äôayoun as part of the cease-fire arrangements. Central and Western sectors The Paratrooper Division began carrying out preparatory tasks on the night of 8‚Äì9 August. IDF forces occupied the Christian village of Dibil, situated to the north of Ayta ash-Sha‚Äôb (which was surrounded but still unoccupied) in the central sector.Final Winograd Report, p. 384 An engineering unit hid in a building in the outskirts of the village but was spotted by Hizbullah scouts and was hit by two missiles fired from Ayta ash-Sha‚Äôb. Nine soldiers were killed and 31 wounded. None of them had even fired a single bullet. The division was ordered to proceed north to the Shiite village of Rashaf, occupy it and open a supply route to the area. The village was eventually occupied but the supply route was not secured.The Final Winograd Report, p. 385 When the cease fire came into effect, the division had advanced about a mile northwards.Matthews, pp. 52 Brigadier General Gal Hirsch‚Äôs Division 91 was ordered to move west from its positions north of Bint Jbeil towards the Mediterranean coast. \\"The action proved chaotic\\" and the operation \\"fell far short of the mark\\" by war‚Äôs end.Matthews, pp. 52-54 According to the Winograd Commission Division 91 was commissioned with the task of occupying the remaining Hizbullah strongholds near the border, such as Bint Jbeil and Ayta ash-Sha'b. The Report gives no details but notes that both towns remained in Hizbullah hands.The Final Winograd Report, p. 386 The Alexandroni brigade fought in the western sector. The brigade finally took up position along the coastal road near al-Mansouri after an operation that took eight days rather than the planned 36 hours. The soldiers suffered hard from lack of food and water and dozens collapsed from dehydration and had to be evacuated. The brigade commander Maj, Nati Barak decided not to send his soldiers after Hizbullah fighters hiding in the nearby village. \\"I have mercy on my soldiers' lives,\\" Barak said. IDF forces managed to advance about one mile north of al-Mansouri by the time the war ended on 14 August. The Bmaryamin landing Friday evening the paratroop brigade under the command of Col. Hagai Mordechai was airlifted to the Bmaryamin plain outside the villages of Yatar and Kafra. For some reason the landing took place much to the south than what was originally planned.Harel and Issacharoff (2008), p. 230 According to Harel and Issacharoff the immediate target was the occupation of \\"village of Jabel-Amal\\"Harel and Issacharoff (2008), p. 234 (probably a mistranslation referring to the town of Yatar in the district of Jabal 'Amil).There is no village named Jabal 'Amil, it is the name of the district. Yatar was described as \\"the headquarters of the [Hizbullah] Nasr unit's Second Territorial Subdivision.\\"Arkin p.24Erlich p.117 The mission was to significantly reduce the rocket fire being launched from the area. Optimism was booming in the Israeli Army Command. According to intelligence estimates Hizbullah was withdrawing. During the night Defence Minister Amir Peretz called Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. \\"Listen, Hezbollah‚Äôs in trouble,\\" Peretz said excitedly to Olmert. \\"Believe me, there‚Äôs never been a flight like this in history. Everything‚Äôs going great. If it continues like this, it‚Äôll be spectacular.\\" When the first Yas‚Äôur helicopter took off, after unloading its soldiers, it was hit by a missile and burst into flames and the crew of five was killed instantly. The helicopter was probably shot down with a shoulder- fired, infrared guided SA-7 missile. Five Israeli crew members were killed, including two senior officers and Sgt.-Maj. Keren Tendler, the only female IDF soldier to die in the war. The Bmaryamin landing was supposed to be the largest heliborne operation in the history of the IDF. After the downing of the helicopter it was apparent that the landing zone had been compromised and that Hizbullah had prepared ambushes in the area. Headquarters decided to call off further landings. Paratroop commander Col. Hagai Mordechai was ordered not to proceed to the target but to abort the mission and hide at the landing zone until next nightfall. More than 200 Paratroopers had landed safely and Mordechai deemed this to be sufficient to carry out the original orders. Instead a precious 24 hours were lost. The next night the mission was again aborted, this time apparently by direct orders from the Prime Minister. Mordechai told an Israeli reporter: \\"I didn‚Äôt think that at this age I‚Äôd find myself hiding in the bushes,\\" The paratroopers were never given the opportunity to carry out their assignments. The ceasefire was to take effect at 8 AM the following morning. The paratroopers instead used the darkness of the night and started withdrawing on foot to Israeli territory. The battles of al-Ghandouriya and Wadi Saluki  Israeli soldiers of the Nahal Brigade withdrawing from Lebanon What became known in Israel as the Battle of Wadi Saluki is called the Battle of Wadi al-Hujeir in Lebanon. Wadi as-Sulouqi originates in the area of Bint Jubeil and runs north several kilometers west of the Israel-Lebanon border until it turns west near the town of at-Tayyiba. The wadi is named Wadi al-Hujeir when it meets the western contributory and turns north before it joins the Litani River near the Akiya bridge. The area was the obvious route of any Israeli attempt to cut south Lebanon off at the Litani river. Both the Israeli invasions in 1978 and 1982 passed through this area. From the first days of the war, Israel bombed the small Christian village of al-Ghandouriya, situated near the wadi crossing, forcing the inhabitants to evacuate their homes. Israel usually did not attack Christian villages for no good reason and for Hizbullah it was clear that the Israeli army intended to pass this way. Several attempted Israeli incursions in the area reinforced this impression. The only question was whether it would take the form of a helicopter landing behind Hizbullah lines or an armored advance from the border. Hizbullah thus reinforced its forces in the area. It took up positions in the vacated villages and started preparing ambushes. General Tzur had twice sent the brigade‚Äôs engineering battalion to secure a foothold on the western bank of the wadi near the village of al-Ghandouriya, in preparation for the rapid sweep westwards towards the city of Tyre. In both cases the Israeli forces were called back for unclear reasons. In both cases the Israeli forces were attacked by anti-tank missiles but for some reason these reports never reached their superiors.Harel and Issacharoff (2008), p. 198 Hizbullah claims to have repulsed the Israeli attacks. The battle was initiated by a large helicopter lift of infantry from the Nahal Brigade in the vicinity of the villages of al-Ghandouriya and Furoun to the west of the wadi. The Infantry was supposed to clear the ground for the advancing tanks but somehow failed in their mission. A column of 24 Merkava tanks from the 401st Brigade advanced westward from the area of Tayyiba and when it entered the wadi it was attacked from all sides, including from the rear near 'Udaysa (Adaisseh) that had been thought to have been under IDF control for several days. The Hizbullah had prepared an ambush from hidden positions on the hilltops. The tanks were attacked by missiles, probably of the Kornet type. Eleven of the tanks were hit and several went up in flames.Harel and Issacharoff (2008), ‚ÄúThe tanks started to go up in flames and the soldiers abandoned them.‚Äù p. 223 Eight tankers, including two company commanders, and four Nahal infantry men died in the initial battle of Sulouqi. Hizbullah fighters used ATGMs, small- arms fire, and mortars to suppress the Nahal Brigade, preventing them from providing effective infantry support for the armor forces. Timur G√∂ksel, the former chief spokesperson for UNIFIL later commented that \\"anyone dumb enough to push a tank column through Wadi Saluki should not be an armored brigade commander but a cook.\\" The division proved unable to open the route across the wadi. Early morning August 13 another tank battalion reported having crossed the wadi successfully but the sweep west was cancelled. No further offensive action was taken on this front.The Final Winograd Report, p. 384 Four IDF infantry soldiers were killed only hours before the cease-fire on the eastern bank of Wadi al-Hujeir. They were killed by an anti-tank rocket fired at them while operating in the village of Qantara. According to the IDF, around 80 Hizbullah fighters were killed in the battle of Wadi Saluki. The IDF claimed it lost 12 soldiers. This estimate seemed to have been based on battle damage assessments from the large number of cluster munitions the IDF used in the final days of the war. Captain Daniel Helmer of the US army commented that \\"as in much of the war, Hezbollah‚Äôs dead proved as elusive as its living fighters. \\" (Article first appeared in ‚Äô‚ÄôArmor‚Äô‚Äô, January‚ÄìFebruary 2007) Lebanese sources claimed that nine Hizbullah fighters were killed during the battles of al-Ghandouriya and Wadi Saluki. According to the Hizbullah version, seven Hizbullah fighters and their commander Rani Adnan Bazzi were killed while fighting a close-quarters battle with IDF troops in al-Ghandourriya. Another three were wounded. One wounded fighter was taken prisoner by Israeli soldiers. He woke up at Poriya hospital in Tiberias and was eventually released in the prisoner exchange in 2008. Hizbullah claimed to have lost only one fighter at Wadi Saluki, and identified him as Ali Salih, a commander. Salih was severely wounded by an Israeli drone strike and died of his injuries in a hospital twenty days later. According to the official Hizbullah version of events, Salih fought singlehandedly at Wadi Saluki, running between Kornet missile positions and firing at the Israeli tanks before finally being hit. Hizbullah claimed that all of the Israeli tanks destroyed at Wadi Saluki were destroyed by Salih. The planned westward sweep towards the coast never materialized. Guy Zur, commander of Division 162, apparently was \\"astonished‚Äù and told the press that Hizbullah was the \\"world‚Äôs best guerrilla group\\". Aftermath Operation Changing Direction 11 \\"was meant to be a large, broad ground operation, which would fundamentally alter reality in Southern Lebanon and the image of the operation in the military sense.\\"The Winograd Commission, p. 370 After the heavy casualties in battles of Sulouqi/al-Hujeir and Bmaryamin plain landings Operation Change of Direction 11 \\"faded away on its own\\", the illusions of the Israeli leadership \\"imploded\\" and its only concern was how to end the war as quickly as possible. According to a Knesset inquiry \\"Israel did not succeed in defeating the enemy, which is made up of only a couple of thousands.\\" The Israeli government therefore, August 13, accepted a ceasefire in accordance with the UN Security Council Resolution 1701. In spite of the ceasefire only taking effect in the morning of August 14, the IDF had stopped most offensive actions already by the night 12 August, or early morning of August 13.The Final Winograd Report, p. 381 According to Harel and Issacharoff operation Change of Direction 11 was a \\"gargantuan failure\\" that \\"failed to meet its objectives\\". Most of the divisions did not even reach the sectors that were earmarked for them. Katyusha fire was not reduced. On the last day of the war more than 250 rockets were fired on Israel. On the same day Israeli TV filmed a Katyusha being fired from a village next to Metulla, less than a kilometer from the border.Harel and Issacharoff (2008), p. 238 Israel supplied the United Nations a map of the 16 pockets and sectors the IDF was occupying in south Lebanon and expressed \\"its desire to withdraw its forces from all of the sectors as quickly as possible.\\" The IDF feared that its soldiers would become \\"sitting ducks for guerilla actions\\". However, no such actions took place. In some minor clashes six Hizbullah militants were allegedly killed by the IDF, but there was no large-scale violations of the U.N.-brokered cease-fire. Also, Israeli forces did not respond to rockets fired by Hizbullah during the night of 15 August, as none of them crossed into Northern Israel. At the time of the cease-fire more than 20 damaged Israeli tanks and armored vehicles were left stranded inside Lebanese territory and the IDF was working hard to bring them back to Israel. Due to the difficulties in removing them the army was considering bombing them from the air \\"so as not to allow Hizbullah terrorists to wave their flags over them after the war.\\" After the ceasefire was signed, Israel started to withdraw from its forward positions and handed them over to the Lebanese Army and UNIFIL. Israel completed the withdrawal within the start of October. pg54 In the last three days of the war 34 Israeli soldiers were killed and 447 were wounded while 1 civilian was killed and 157 civilians were wounded. The main objective of the operation, the reduction of the missile attacks on Israeli north, was not accomplished. According to Israeli statistics over 400 missiles were fired in the last three days of the war.Winograd report, pp. 598‚Äì610 General Tzur held a press conference lauding the accomplishments of the IDF in the Sulouqi crossing. Some of the present reporters questioned what exactly was gained in the battle. \\"Let‚Äôs take a look at it. Immediately after crossing the obstacle with considerable losses, you ordered a halt. And now, there‚Äôs a cease-fire and the IDF is going to pull out of the forward positions that it captured, so what the hell did the soldiers die for?\\" Tzur refused to answer the question and referred it to his superiors.Harel and Issacharoff (2008), p. 227 According to Haaretz an anonymous \\"highly placed\\" American official, Operation Changing Direction 11 significantly affected the text of the UNSCR 1701 in favor of Israel.http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/idf-s-push-into- lebanon-changed-un-resolution-1.196249 Later Haaretz learned that the Israeli government had received the final version of the resolution before the final operation was launched. Ministry document shows only slight variations in resolution drafts that Olmert used to authorize ground raid. United States UN ambassador John Bolton denied that the Security Council negotiations were affected by the events on the ground. In fact the implementation of the operation was postponed for two days in anticipation of the negotiations in the Security Council. It was finally initiated in the evening of August 11 only hours before the Security Council approved of the resolution calling for a ceasefire.The Final Winograd Report, p. 251, 380 Resolution 1701 called for the \\"disarmament of all armed groups\\" in Lebanon in accordance with the Taif Accords, and of Security Council resolutions 1559 (2004) and 1680 (2006). Hizbullah accepted a ceasefire but did not accept to be disarmed until the last Israeli occupation soldier had left Lebanese territory. That included according to Hizbullah the Shebaa farms occupied by Israel in the 1967 war and this position was supported by the Lebanese government. To avoid future conflicts with the UNIFIL a compromise agreement was hammered out between Hizbullah and the Lebanese government that Hizbullah weapons south on the Litani had to be kept hidden. Lebanon's Defense Minister Elias Murr denied that the Lebanese army would disarm Hizbullah. \\"The army is not going to the south to strip Hezbollah of weapons and do the work Israel did not.\\" Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, however, stated that if Hizbullah did not disarm, Israel would continue with what he termed \\"a long, hard, arduous, complex fight.\\" According to a survey done after the ceasefire, only 3 percent of Israelis believed that the country achieved most or all of its pre-war objectives while 58 percent believed that Israel achieved few if any objectives in the war. Only six percent of respondents said they thought the Security Council resolution was good, against 66 percent who thought it was not good. A full 38 percent said the deal was not good but Israel had no choice but to accept it. Former chief of staff Moshe Ya'alon dismissed the operation as a \\"spin move\\": \\"It had no substantive security-political goal, only a spin goal. It was meant to supply the missing victory picture. You don't do that. You don't send soldiers to carry out a futile mission after the political outcome has already been set. I consider that corrupt.\\" Ron Tira writes that \\"the fact that several hundred Hizbollah fighters faced up to four Israeli divisions and the Israel Air Force, and ended the war standing up after inflicting significant damage on IDF forces, may also generate indirect results that are at best problematic.\\" Following the end of the war, Hizbullah started building a new defensive line north of the Litani river.http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Opinion/Commentary/Sep/11/A-Hizbullah- Maginot-Line-on-the-Litani.ashx#axzz2B4wJPvrW Israel Defense Forces fatalities Aug 10, 2006 * Sgt.-Maj.

Written by humorist Dave Barry and novelist Ridley Pearson, the book is a sequel to their book Peter and the Starcatchers, continuing the story of the orphan Peter and his latest adventures with the Starcatchers. The \\"Starcatchers\\" series is an epic story of a battle between good and evil, incorporating a reimagined version of characters and situations from J.M. Barrie's classic novel Peter and Wendy. It was illustrated by artist Greg Call. The series continues in Peter and the Secret of Rundoon, Peter and the Sword of Mercy, and The Bridge to Never Land. Hyperion also released a series of short short chapter books by the same authors, detailing daily misadventures of the Lost Boys. Plot summary The book starts three months after the end of Peter and the Starcatchers.Chapter 13 Peter, James, Thomas, Prentiss, and Tubby Ted have settled on the island, with Tinker Bell keeping a watchful eye on Peter and the pirates, led by Black Stache (who now goes by the lies \\"Captain Hook\\" since his initial fight with Peter), have erected and settled into a fort. Around this time, Le Fantome, under scarred Captain Nerezza, finds Mollusk Island after weeks of searching, accompanied by the vengeful Slank and the dark, menacing, mysterious entity known as Lord Ombra. During a confrontation with Hook as Peter and the mermaids rescue a captured James, a posse fromLe Famtome hold a nighttime standoff with the Mollusk tribe over the location of the large quantity of Starstuff that had briefly been on the island. After Ombra deduces that the Starstuff was taken by Lord Aster and the Starcatchers, the group leaves the island and immediately set sail for England. Peter, having witnessed the confrontation, decides that he must warn Molly of the approaching danger and stows away on the ship with Tinker Bell. The Asters receive a tip from the dolphins warning them of the landing party on Mollusk Island and the presence of the inhuman Ombra, prompting Leonard Aster to leave London with the Starstuff and guard it in a hidden location until the Return (the starstuff would be sent back into the heavens), leaving new nightmen to guard Molly and her mother, Louise. Meanwhile, Peter's presence on the ship is detected by Lord Ombra, forcing Peter to fake his death by temporarily jumping ship before flying back on board. When they arrive in London, Peter and Tinker Bell take off to find the Aster mansion but quickly become lost in the city. Peter and Tink are later captured and separated by a constable and a bird seller, respectively, but Tink is able to escape and save Peter from a court hearing. They continue to search for the Aster mansion in upper-class parts of London. Meanwhile, Slank, Nerezza, and Ombra plan with various agents of the Others on how to safely invade the Aster household, whereas Ombra possesses the new nightmen so that they would not be a problem. After finding gnawed food remnants on the ship and after hearing of Peter's escape from the court by flying, Slank deduces that Peter is in London and believes that he will interfere with their plans. Later, the men break into the household to capture Molly and Louise. Jenna, a housemaid who is in cahoot with the group, puts the household staff to sleep and threatens Molly in her room with a knife while Slank and various others kidnap Louise and Ombra makes his way to Molly's room. With directions from J. M. Barrie, Peter arrives and locates Molly, who realizes that Ombra possesses his victims by touching their shadows and blows out the candles. They barely escape from Ombra and take shelter in the room of Molly's friend George Darling, and decide to locate Leonard Aster. Peter and Molly later make a nighttime visit to the Tower of London, where the Keep, a secret compound of the Starcatchers, is located. After conferring with Starcatcher Mr. McGuinn about the situation, Ombra, Slank, and various others break in, killing McGuinn, but Molly and Peter manage to escape. With help from George, they deduce that Aster went to Salisbury and there three take a train in and eventually locate him there. Aster expresses his disdain at their arrival but learns of the situation and an apparent ransom for Louise from Molly, but confines them to the house after revealing that the Return was to happen that night. Molly later recalls that Ombra touched McGuinn's shadow before he died, thus realizing that Ombra may have seized knowledge of the Return and that it is in danger. After letting george in on the business of the Starcatchers, George recalls that a lunar eclipse was happening that night, and that the site of the Return was Stonehedge. The three escape from the house and fly to Stonehedge. Meanwhile, Aster and fellow Starcatchers Magill are ambushed midway through the return by Ombra, Slank, Nerezza, and various agents of the Others. Aster is shot after closing the box of Starstuff to protect a possessed Louise, and Slank nearly kills Peter. Molly and George haul out the Asters, while Tink, Magill, and Magill's bear Karl drive off the men. Peter stays behind to reopen the closed box before the timeframe for the Return finishes, but Ombra makes contact with Peter's shadow and the both engage in a brief but intense mental battle before Peter manages to open the box, thus completing the Return of the Starstuff to the Heavens, with the resulting flashes of light seemingly disintegrating Ombra and releasing Louise and various others from his control. Slank and the Others are forced to flee. A couple days later, Peter bids his goodbyes to the Asters and George before flying back to Mollusk Island. During the plot in London, Captain Hook and the pirates manage to locate and capture James, Thomas, Prentiss, and Tubby Ted in order to lure Peter back and get his revenge. After some time, with the unknowing help of first mate Smee and various island monkeys, the boys manage to escape the cage that they were located in just as Peter arrives and opens the gates of the fort for them to get out, and afterwards promptly hits Hook in the face with a mango, ending the book. Characters Many of the characters from Peter and the Starcatchers are back for this sequel. However, a few characters are also mentioned in Peter Pan and Wendy, and some were created exclusively for Peter and the Shadow Thieves. *Peter has gained the permanent ability to fly and to never physically grow older because of his exposure to starstuff. Peter has red hair. Growing cocky from his new abilities, he torments Captain Hook. When Hook captures one of Peter's friends, James, Peter vows to become more mature. So, when he learns his friend Molly will be in danger, because Lord Ombra will use her to exchange the starstuff, stating that fathers have soft spots for their daughters, he immediately sets out to save her. He is more than a little disturbed that she has a male friend named George Darling. Peter is accompanied in his adventures by his guardian Tinker Bell, a small fairy or \\"birdwoman\\", who is very protective of Peter. *Tinker Bell was originally a green-and-yellow-coloured bird put in a bag of starstuff and was made into the guardian of Peter by Molly's father, the famous starcatcher, Lord Leonard Aster. She hates when she is called a fairy, because she would much rather be called \\"birdwoman\\" because it supports her heritage. She is very protective of Peter, she supremely dislikes when Peter pays attention to any other female, she calls the mermaid, Teacher, \\"a big fat grouper\\", tends to hope she gets eaten by an octopus, and Molly Aster as \\"a stupid fat cow\\". She is able to emit a very bright light. This helps Peter many times against Lord Ombra, though this technique often ends in her exhaustion and sometimes fainting. *Molly Aster, daughter to the great Starcatcher Leonard Aster, looks a lot like her mother, with long brown hair, but inherited her father's startling green eyes. London society views her as a beautiful child, but also unusual, seeing as she is not interested in the things girls her class are into, and appears have her mind is always thinking of something else. When her father leaves to move a great amount of starstuff to a safe location, she is left behind as company for her mother. Soon, Molly learns that her house is invaded by spies, and that the creature Lord Ombra wants to steal her family's shadows. Molly sets off with Peter to continue protecting the starstuff, even at the cost of her mother's life. Molly lives in a mansion near Kensington Gardens, and she is a childhood friend to George Darling. They both have feelings for each other, as hinted in this book, and don't know how or whether to express their feelings. It is hinted she also has feelings for Peter. *The Lost Boys were originally orphans from St. Norbert's Home for Wayward Boys. James is leader to Thomas, Prentiss, and Tubby Ted when Peter is not around. The Lost Boys discover their underground home in this book ‚Äî they are also captured and nearly killed by Captain Hook, but manage to escape. *Captain Hook, formerly Black Stache, is a disgusting, filthy pirate, captain of the ship, the Jolly Roger. As his left hand was cut off by Peter, he replaced it with a hook-shaped dagger, earning his nickname from Peter. Annoyed by Peter's constant teasing, Hook tries unsuccessfully to use the Lost Boys as a ransom. He can not bear to leave his newly built fortress, for fear of being eaten by the huge crocodile, Mr. Grin. *Mr. Slank is the evil sailor from the Never Land, returning from the first book. Slank is one of the \\"Others\\" who use starstuff corruptly, and he has joined forces with the creature Lord Ombra to avenge his humiliation by Peter. In Starcatchers, Slank had a sidekick named Little Richard. Slank had to kill Richard and eat him in order to survive for months in an adrift rowboat. His fate is unknown after the encounter with Starcatchers. *Lord Ombra is the new villain in this novel, and Peter's arch-nemesis. He is part man, part shadow, and he moves like liquid. He causes a chill to come over anyone he nears, because he is able to steal their shadow or possess them to read their thoughts and enslave them. Ombra is afraid of the light, but it aids him in capturing shadows. He is one of the greater \\"Others\\". Lord Ombra is destroyed by a brilliant flash of light that breaks him into millions of tiny shadows. The name Ombra is derived from the Italian word for \\"shadow\\". *Captain Nerezza is captain of the ship Le Fantome, and he is one of the \\"Others\\" who uses starstuff for evil. Nerezza takes Lord Ombra and Slank from England and back again in search of starstuff. One important feature of Nerezza is he has no nose ‚Äî it was cut off in Africa, but replaced by a wooden nose carved from blackwood and held on with a leather strap. Nerezza is able to smell by lifting the false nose and breathing through a hole in his face. The name Nerezza is derived from the Italian word for \\"blackness\\". *George Darling is Molly Aster's London friend, and he grows up to become the father of Wendy, John, and Michael. George apparently has feelings for Molly, but he finds her changed since she returned from her voyage at sea. He is very loyal, and allows even Peter to stay in his room without his parents' knowledge. George is most likely featured in this novel because at the end of Disney's 1953 film, Mr. Darling implies that he has met Peter Pan \\"a long time ago, when I was very young\\". *Lord Leonard Aster and Lady Louise Aster, Molly's parents, live in a mansion near Kensington Gardens. Molly's father is an ambassador to King Zarboff III of Rundoon, but he is secretly one of the greatest Starcatchers. Leonard jeopardizes the mission of returning the starstuff at Stonehenge, because his wife and daughter are about to be killed. Leonard himself is shot in Shadow Thieves, but Peter heals him with a bit of starstuff. Louise Aster is Molly's mother, who is left behind with her daughter when her husband leaves to look after the starstuff. Lady Aster's shadow is stolen by Lord Ombra, and her corpse-like body is used to lure Molly out of hiding. Louise Aster's shadow is returned by the end of the novel. *Mr Magill is a Starcatcher who own tame wolves and a tame bear. He can communicate with them and uses them to protect a home that the Starcatcher own. He also helps keep the Others away while Peter completes the Return. He also returns in Sword of Mercy and is mentioned in Bridge to Never Land. *J.M. Barrie - a nice young man who rescues Peter from being beaten by a gang of hooligans in London.

He is now Head Physiotherapist and Head of Medical at Accrington Stanley FC. Morgan's career lasted from 1997 until 2012, starting out with Preston North End in the 1997‚Äì98 campaign. He failed to make an appearance for North End from then until his departure in 2001 and also spent a spell on loan with League of Ireland side Sligo Rovers. His spell in Ireland brought a brief and solitary cap for the Northern Ireland U21 side. In 2001, he joined Lincoln City where he spent seven years of his career, notably qualifying for the League Two play-offs in four consecutive seasons, losing out in the 2002‚Äì03 and 2004‚Äì05 seasons at the final in the Millennium Stadium. Morgan became Lincoln skipper towards the end of his spell with the club and racked 212 league appearances, scoring 2 goals. In 2007, he joined Bury where his former Lincoln boss Keith Alexander had taken up the director of football role. After two years with Bury he followed Alexander again to Macclesfield Town where he spent the last three years of his career. At the age of 33, having been released by Macclesfield at the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season, Morgan retired from professional football. Club career Preston North End Born in Belfast, Morgan began his career at Preston North End, spending time on loan at Sligo Rovers during the 1997‚Äì98 season. In his time at Sligo, Morgan was part of the team which won the 1997‚Äì98 League of Ireland Cup, defeating Shelbourne over two legs in February. His time at Preston was blighted by injury and he made only a solitary League Cup appearance for the club. Lincoln City On 9 July 2001 Morgan linked up with Lincoln City on an initial one month's contract. Morgan had been offered a new contract by Preston North End but turned it down favouring a move to Sincil Bank in a bid to impress the Imps manager Alan Buckley. After performing well during the pre-season, including scoring on his debut in a 5‚Äì1 friendly victory over Collingham on 13 July, he signed a two-year deal with the club on 7 August. Morgan would go on to captain the side in 2002/3 and formed a fifth of a defence (with Stuart Bimson, Simon Weaver, Ben Futcher and Mark Bailey) that only conceded 37 goals in 46 League games that season. He was consistently linked to sides much higher up the Football League and was widely regarded as one of the best defenders in the lower leagues. He is one of the few players to have been involved in all five of the seasons where Lincoln reached the Playoffs to date, although he missed some of the actual Playoffs due to injury. Paul scored twice during his time at Lincoln, the latter of which was a 93rd-minute equaliser in an away game at Torquay United, a game which the Imps would then win two minutes later. Thankfully he was rarely beyond the halfway line and his no-nonsense style of defending won him many fans at Sincil Bank. Bury He signed for Bury on 26 June 2007 but his first season with the club was hampered by a knee injury. Macclesfield Town On 8 July 2008 Morgan went on a season-long loan to Macclesfield Town, where he would work with manager Keith Alexander for the third time in his career. He was appointed Macclesfield's captain ahead of the 2010/2011 season by manager Gary Simpson who described him as 'perfect captain material', as well as studying at the University of Salford for a degree in Physiotherapy. In May 2012, Morgan was released by Macclesfield due to the expiry of his contract. Morgan joined Conference National side Barrow on trial in July 2012 but was unable to earn a contract. International career Morgan has represented his national team, Northern Ireland, at Under-16, Under-18 and Under-21 level, however, has not represented them at senior level. His only call up came in 2002/3, but the friendly was cancelled a week before theg ame was due to be played. Physiotherapist At the age of 33, having been released by Macclesfield at the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season, Morgan retired from professional football and signed for Accrington Stanley as the club's new head physiotherapist. Morgan is also the Head Physiotherapist for the Montserrat National Team, under Manager and Head Coach Willie Donachie.

Hunt was born in Sussex to John Hunt and Mary Ann (n√©e Cooke) and baptised at St. Nicholas, Brighton, on 14 August 1833. England, Select Births and Christenings, 1538‚Äì1975 He was a navigator when he arrived in the Swan River Colony in 1863. He started working as an assistant surveyor in Fremantle. In April 1863 Hunt and J. B. Ridley were supplied to Walter Padbury for his private expedition to the north-west coast as explorers and surveyors in the cutter Mystery, following a stretch of coast which included the harbour now known as Port Hedland. Hunt never put his name to any of his discoveries, but the pass between the De Grey River district and Nickol Bay district was later named after him. In 1864, he was asked to look for the pastoral land and water supplies identified along the route of Henry Lefroy's 1863 expedition into what is now known as the Coolgardie area. Hunt's party of six included Kowitch, the Aboriginal guide from Lefroy's expedition. Leaving York on 9 July they reached Gnarlbine Rock on 16 August. From Gnarlbine the party headed east towards Lake Lefroy. Hunt gave a good report of the grasslands that Lefroy had sighted and these were later named the Hampton Plains after Governor Hampton. His third expedition was between January and October 1865 and he led the expedition of six pensioner guards, ten convicts and George Mundial, an Aboriginal. This expedition was sent to establish a track and enlarge wells between York and Gnarlbine to enable livestock to be moved to the Hampton Plains. They established 23 wells. In 1866, Hunt led another party to extend the track and wells to Lake Lefroy and create another track with wells leading north-east through the Coolgardie area. With him as second-in-command on this expedition was Frederick Mackie Roe, son of John Septimus Roe. Hunt noted in his diaries that on many occasions he was \\"too ill to work today\\". Despite this, he continued until the track was completed. Prospectors Bayley and Ford in 1892 used the new track and wells to gain access to the area in which they were to be successful in discovering gold. The track was later utilised by C. Y. O'Connor in building the Goldfields Water Supply Scheme. Hunt became ill in December 1867 and was in hospital by January 1868. He died from heart disease on 1 March 1868, aged 35.

It is one of the municipalities with a large majority of German speakers in the mostly French speaking Canton of Fribourg. History Schmitten is first mentioned in 1242 as Schmitton. In the 14th century, the name Der Schmitten was common. Because the chapel of Schmitten was consecrated to Saint Otmar, for a period the town was also called Othmarswil, first mentioned in 1379. The Earl of Thierstein ruled Schmitten in medieval times. In the 15th century, Schmitten came under the authority of Fribourg, where it was subordinated under the \\"Old Landscape\\" (Aupanner). After the breakdown of the Ancien R√©gime (1798), Schmitten belonged to the District of Fribourg and after 1831 to the Germanspeaking District Freiburg, bevor it was integrated into the District of Singine (Sensebezirk) with the new constitution of the canton. With regard to the church as well as political aspects, Schmitten always belonged to the neighbouring community of D√ºdingen. In the church community of D√ºdingen, Schmitten formed two parishes, called the \\"Wilerschrot\\" and \\"Lantenschrot\\". The liberal constitution of the canton Fribourg of 1831 resulted in forming the four boroughs of the church community of D√ºdingen into independent communities, but this development was reverted already in 1832. The parishes \\"Wilerschrot\\" and \\"Lantenschrot\\" were unified into the new \\"Schmittenschrot\\", which aimed at independency in both the church and political aspects. Due to differences with the church community of D√ºdingen, Schmitten became an own parish in 1885. The fact that Schmitten now was an own parish, and also the circumstance that Schmitten had their own train station that became a regional center, lead to an effort becoming an independent political community as well. The inhabitants of Schmitten were asked about their opinion in a consultational vote, resulting in a share of 95% of voters in favour of an independent political community. Against the opinion of the municipal council of D√ºdingen, the council of Fribourg decided on 21 November 1922 to declare for Schmitten the status of an independent political community.Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz published by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office accessed 19 July 2011 A further enlargement of Schmitten took place in 1976 when the neighbouring community of W√ºnnewil- Flamatt gave a residential area of 29 hectares north of the train station to Schmitten.

Transportation The town has excellent traffic connections both by road and rail. Schmitten is very close to the old main road from Bern to Fribourg. In 1973, the new motorway A12 (Bern to Vevey) opened in a distance of 6 km to the town center. The closest entrances to the motorway are D√ºdingen and Flamatt. So, Schmitten can benefit from the motorway while still being far enough from it to not suffer from noise and passing traffic. Already in the year 1860 (1860-07-02), the train connection from Bern to D√ºdingen (Balliswil) was opened with a train station in Schmitten and a stop in Fillistorf. There are further connections to the smaller places by bus. Education School buildings in Schmitten In Schmitten about 1,152 or (35.1%) of the population have completed non- mandatory upper secondary education, and 404 or (12.3%) have completed additional higher education (either university or a Fachhochschule). Of the 404 who completed tertiary schooling, 71.5% were Swiss men, 22.3% were Swiss women, 3.5% were non-Swiss men and 2.7% were non-Swiss women. The Canton of Fribourg school system provides one year of non-obligatory Kindergarten, followed by six years of Primary school. This is followed by three years of obligatory lower Secondary school where the students are separated according to ability and aptitude. Following the lower Secondary students may attend a three or four year optional upper Secondary school. The upper Secondary school is divided into gymnasium (university preparatory) and vocational programs. After they finish the upper Secondary program, students may choose to attend a Tertiary school or continue their apprenticeship.Chart of the education system in Canton Fribourg During the 2010-11 school year, there were a total of 354 students attending 17 classes in Schmitten. A total of 647 students from the municipality attended any school, either in the municipality or outside of it. There were 5 kindergarten classes with a total of 101 students in the municipality. The municipality had 12 primary classes and 253 students. During the same year, there were no lower secondary classes in the municipality, but 155 students attended lower secondary school in a neighboring municipality. There were no upper Secondary classes or vocational classes, but there were 59 upper Secondary students and 69 upper Secondary vocational students who attended classes in another municipality. The municipality had no non- university Tertiary classes, but there were 2 specialized Tertiary students who attended classes in another municipality. , there were 8 students in Schmitten who came from another municipality, while 200 residents attended schools outside the municipality.

A tabby is any domestic cat (Felis catus) with a distinctive 'M' shaped marking on its forehead, stripes by its eyes and across its cheeks, along its back, and around its legs and tail, and (differing by tabby type), characteristic striped, dotted, lined, flecked, banded or swirled patterns on the body‚Äîneck, shoulders, sides, flanks, chest and abdomen. \\"Tabby\\" is not a breed of cat but a coat type seen in almost all genetic lines of domestic cats, regardless of status.A Tribute to Tabby Cats in all Their Manifestations. About.com:Cats. Retrieved on January 31, 2008 The tabby pattern is found in many official cat breeds and is a hallmark of the landrace extremely common among the general population of cats around the world. The tabby pattern occurs naturally and is connected both to the coat of the domestic cat's direct ancestor and to those of their close relatives: the African wildcat (Felis lybica lybica), the European wildcat (Felis silvestris silvestris) and the Asiatic wildcat (Felis lybica ornata), all of which have similar coats, both by pattern and coloration. A genetic study of tabbies found five genetic clusters to be ancestral to cats of various parts of the world. Etymology A 19th-century drawing of a tabby cat The English term tabby originates from the translation of the French phrase \\"striped silk taffeta,\\" the root of which is tabis, meaning \\"a rich watered silk.\\" This can be further traced to the Middle French atabis (14th century), which stemmed from the Arabic term attabiya. This word is a reference to the Attabiya district of Baghdad, noted for its striped cloth and silk; such silk cloth became popular in the Muslim world and spread to England, where the word \\"tabby\\" became commonly used in the 17th and 18th centuries. Tabby is also comparable to the Spanish word ataviar, which means \\"to decorate or to dress or wear\\" and often implies luxurious clothing.ataviar - Definici√≥n - WordReference.com. Retrieved on May 6, 2013 Use of the term tabby cat for a cat with a striped coat began in the 1690s and was shortened to tabby in 1774. The notion that tabby is indicative of a female cat may be due to the feminine proper name Tabby as a shortened form of Tabitha. Patterns Prototypical tabby patterns in the head region: An 'M' on the forehead, bright eye rims and borders of the ears The dark lines on a Mackerel tabby‚Äôs cheeks Seal lynx point showing the bullseye classic pattern Abyssinians Brown Spotted tabby pattern on an Ocicat Domestic tabby/white cat The four known distinct patterns, each having a sound genetic explanation, are the mackerel, classic, ticked and spotted tabby patterns.Cat Colors FAQ Cat Fanciers. Retrieved on January 31, 2008 A fifth pattern is formed by any of the four basic patterns when part of a patched pattern‚Äîa patched tabby, then, is a calico or tortoiseshell cat with patches of tabby coat (such cats are called caliby and torbie, respectively, in cat fancy). All five patterns have been observed in random-bred populations. Several additional patterns are found in specific breeds and so are not as well known in general. For example, a modified classic tabby is found in the Sokoke breed. Some of these rarer patterns are due to the interaction of wild and domestic genes, as with the rosetted and marbled patterns found in the Bengal breed. Mackerel tabby The mackerel tabby pattern gives slender vertical, gently curving stripes on the sides of the body. These stripes may be continuous or broken into bars and short segments/spots, especially on the flanks and stomach. Three or five vertical lines in an 'M' shape almost always appear on the forehead, along with dark lines from the corners of the eyes, one or more crossing each cheek, and of course many stripes and lines at various angles on the neck and shoulder area, on the flanks, and around the legs and tail, marks which are more or less perpendicular to the length of the body part. Mackerel tabbies are also called 'fishbone tabbies,' probably doubly named after the mackerel fish. Mackerels are the most common among tabbies. Classic tabby The classic tabby (also known as blotched or marbled tabby) has the 'M' pattern on the forehead but the body markings, rather than primarily thin stripes or spots, are thick curving bands in a whirled or swirled pattern with a distinctive mark on each side of the body resembling a bullseye. Classic black tabbies tend to have dark browns, olives and ochres that stand out more against their blacks and classic orange tabbies have richer, fuller fields of red than their mackerel counterparts. Classic tabbies each have a light- colored \\"butterfly\\" pattern on the shoulders and three thin stripes (the center stripe being darkest) running along the spine. Classic tabbies have thick stripes, bands and/or bars on the legs, tail, and cheeks. Classic tabby is a recessive trait. Classic tabbies are the most common type of tabby in much of the United Kingdom and the Middle East, among other places, but they are a far second in number to mackerel tabbies in most parts of the world. Ticked tabby The ticked tabby pattern is due to even fields of agouti hairs, each with distinct bands of color, which break up the tabby patterning into a salt-and-pepper appearance that makes them look sand-like‚Äîthus there are few to no stripes or bands. Residual ghost striping and/or barring can often be seen on the lower legs, face, and belly and sometimes at the tail tip, as well as the standard 'M' and a long dark line running along the spine, primarily in ticked tabbies who also carry a mackerel or classic tabby allele. These types of cats come in many forms and colors. Spotted tabby The spotted tabby is thought to be the result of a modifier gene that breaks up the mackerel tabby pattern and causes the stripes to appear as spots. Similarly, the classic tabby pattern may be broken by the presence of the spotted tabby gene into large spots. Both large spot and small spot patterns can be seen in the Australian Mist, Bengal, Serengeti, Savannah, Egyptian Mau, Arabian Mau, Maine Coon, and Ocicat breeds, among others, as well as some crosses. Naturally, the most common spotted tabby looks most similar to the mackerel tabby, including the classic marks on the limbs, tail and head, including the 'M' on the forehead. Orange tabby The orange tabby is orange and white, usually having a white underside and paws, while its back is usually orange. There can be darker orange markings such as spots or stripes on the orange areas, but the white areas are mostly a solid color. The ratios between orange and white can greatly vary, but can range from a few orange spots on the back of a white cat to a thin white stripe down the stomach. Usually they have either a white spot on their face that covers their mouth and sides of their face, and comes to a point around their forehead; or their faces will be orange, and they will only have white starting on the bottom of their head or on their neck. The majority of orange tabby cats are male. About 20% of orange tabbies are estimated to be female. The orange coloring is found on the X chromosome. Female cats have XX chromosomes to the male's XY. Thus, both the mother and father cat must pass on the genes to the female, but males only need the trait from their mothers. Genetic explanations Tabby point on Mekong Bobtail The four basic tabby patterns are due to two distinct gene loci (the agouti gene locus, with two alleles, and the tabby locus, with three alleles) and one modifier (spotted, with two alleles). The fifth pattern is an emergent one expressed by female cats with one black and one orange gene (one on each of their two X chromosomes) and is explained by Barr bodies and the genetics of sex-linked inheritance. The agouti gene, with its two alleles, A and a,Cats of a Different Color, Agouti. controls whether or not the tabby pattern is expressed. The dominant A expresses the underlying tabby pattern, while the recessive non-agouti or \\"hypermelanistic\\" allele, a, does not. Solid-color (black or blue) cats have the aa combination, hiding the tabby pattern, although sometimes a suggestion of the underlying pattern can be seen (\\"ghost striping\\"). This underlying pattern, whether classic, mackerel, ticked or spotted, is most easily distinguishable under bright light in the early stages of kittenhood and in on the tail in adulthood. However, the agouti gene primarily controls the production of black pigment, so a cat with an O allele for orange color will still express the tabby pattern. As a result, both red cats and the patches of red on tortoiseshell cats will always show tabby patterning, though sometimes the stripes are muted‚Äîespecially in cream and blue/cream cats due to the pigment dilution. The most common tabby pattern is mackerel and its Tm allele at the tabby gene locus is dominant over the classic (or blotched) allele, Tb. So a cat with a TmTm or TmTb genotype sets the basic pattern of thin stripes (mackerel tabby) that underlies the coat, while a TbTb cat will express a classic tabby coat pattern with thick bands and a ring or concentric stripes on its sides. The ticked tabby pattern is a result of a different allele at the same gene locus as the mackerel and classic tabby patterns and this allele is dominant over the others. So a TaTa genotype as well as TaTm and TaTb genotypes will be ticked tabbies. The ticked tabby coat essentially masks any other tabby pattern, producing a non- patterned, or agouti tabby (much like the wild type agouti coat of many other mammals and the sable coat of dogs), with virtually no stripes or bars. If the ticked allele is present, no other tabby pattern will be expressed. The ticked allele actually shows incomplete dominance: cats homozygous for the ticked allele (TaTa) have less barring than cats heterozygous for the ticked allele (TaTm or TaTb). The spotted gene is a separate locus theorized to be directly connected to the Tm allele; it 'breaks' the lines and thin stripes of a mackerel tabby, creating spots. The spotted gene has a dominant and a recessive allele as well, which means a spotted cat will have an Sp Sp or Sp sp genotype along with at least one Tm allele and at least one A allele at those alleles‚Äô respective loci. History A European wildcat (F. s. silvestris) bearing a similar coat pattern to that of a tabby cat. It is thought that the tabby pattern originates from the numerous related species of wildcat. Since the tabby pattern is a common wild type, it might be assumed that medieval cats were tabbies. However, one writer believed this to be untrue, at least in England. Sometime after the mid-17th century, the natural philosopher John Aubrey noted that William Laud, the Archbishop of Canterbury was \\"a great lover of Cats\\" and \\"was presented with some Cyprus-cats, i.e. our Tabby-Cats\\". He then claimed that \\"I doe well remember that the common English Catt, was white with some blueish piednesse (i.e. white with grey parts). The race or breed of them is now almost lost.\\"Oliver Lawson Dick, ed. Aubrey's Brief Lives. Edited from the Original Manuscripts, 1949, p. xxxvi. However, most drawings or paintings of cats in medieval manuscripts do show them to be tabbies.Kathleen Walker-Meikle, Medieval Cats (British Library, 2011). Notable examples Well-known tabby cats include Freya, who belongs to former British Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, and Think Think, one of two cats belonging to the President of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen. One of the first mass-produced stuffed toys, the Ithaca Kitty, was inspired by a grey tabby cat with seven toes on each front foot. While no very famous real or fictional black tabbies have come along (aside perhaps from Abraham Lincoln‚Äôs cat Tabby) the blue mackerel tabby All Ball of the famous gorilla Koko is well known and several red tabbies have entertained people over the years: Heathcliff and Garfield from newspaper comic strips are both orange with black stripes, as is Bill The Cat from Bloom County; Azrael from The Smurfs is solid orange in the cartoons and, as red cats who appear solid are extremely rare, a red mackerel in the live action movie; Thomasina from Disney‚Äôs 1963 movie based on a 1957 novel about a cat who lives three lives is an orange mackerel tabby. The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O;) once featured a gray or brown Tabby named Chessie as part of its Advertisement scheme. Chessie, and the slogan \\"Sleep Like a Kitten\\" was created in 1933 to market sleeper cars on the C&O;'s premier passenger trains. Three more Tabbies were added in 1937, Peake who was Chessie's \\"husband\\" and kittens Nip and Tuck. During World War 2, the C&O; used Chessie and the Kittens to promote War Bonds and the Home Front. In 1972, Chessie's silhouette would be used to create the logo for Chessie System, the successor to C&O.; Even today, Chessie is still remembered as one of the most iconic mascots in railroading and marketing history.

Biography He was born at Gonrieux near Namur on 1 April 1688. Like many of the members of his congregation he was one of the so-called Appelants who in 1713 did not accept the Papal Bull \\"Unigenitus\\", but appealed to a general council. He died in the monastery of the \\"Blancs-Manteaux\\" in Paris on 3 November 1746. Works Dantine's chief merit is the work he did in chronology; he can, in reality, be called one of the founders of this branch of history, on account of the carefully elaborated plan he drew up for the great publication: \\"L'Art de v√©rifier les dates historiques, des chartes, des chroniques et autres monuments, depuis la naissance de J.-C.\\". He did most of the preparatory work for this publication, constructing more exact chronological tables and introducing a better method for calculating historical dates. Due to illness, he was unable to continue his labours and was obliged to leave their completion to other members of his order, his chief successor being Charles Cl√©mencet. He also devoted himself to linguistic studies and as a result of these published a translation with commentary of the Psalms under the title: \\"Les psaumes traduits sur l'h√©breu avec des notes\\" (Paris, 1739). This work attracted so much attention that in the same year a second, and in the following year a third edition became necessary. In collaboration with Dom Carpentier he prepared a new edition of the great lexicon originally published in 1678 by Du Cange, and afterwards continued by the Maurists, its first Benedictine editor being Dom Guesni√©, who was followed by Nicolas Toustain and Louis Le Pelletier. The edition of Dantine and Carpentier, half as large again as that of Du Cange, appeared in six volumes at Paris, 1733‚Äì36, under the title: \\"Glossarium ad scriptores medi√¶ et infim√¶ latinitatis, editio locupletior oper√¢ et studio monachorum O.S.B.\\" Dantine's labours greatly increased the value of this work, which is not only of the importance for the knowledge of Latin, but is also a source for the study of law and morals in the Middle Ages.

History Originally conceived as an Old West theme park in the mold of Disneyland by Phoenix artist and advertising agency owner Louis E. Crandall, Legend City endured a series of closings, bankruptcies and ownership changes throughout the 1960s and 1970s, and was never a significant financial success. Nevertheless, Legend City is still remembered fondly and held in high regard by locals who knew and frequented the park in its heyday. Legend City opened to much public fanfare on June 29, 1963, but rapidly fell into financial difficulty and fell into bankruptcy after only six months. Crandall departed as president, and the first of several ownership changes then ensued. The property was purchased by Sam Shoen of U-Haul and opened as a theme park. U-Haul's private advertising agency, A&M; Associates, handled the 'rebirth' to a theme park for children. This was probably the park's most successful period. Mr Shoen lost interest in the park and it was eventually sold to the Mitsubishi Corporation out of Japan as a show park where the company's amusement rides could be featured to prospective buyers. The park was deserted by the Japanese owners and left to ruin. The Capell family, who had been in the carnival business for many years, then bought the property but were unable to restore Legend City to its former glory. The land was eventually purchased in 1982 by the Salt River Project, which closed the park permanently after the 1983 season. Legend City was then dismantled and razed to the ground to make way for new corporate offices for SRP. Legend City featured a number of popular and memorable attractions such as the Lost Dutchman Mine ride, Cochise‚Äôs Stronghold river ride, Sky Ride, Penny Arcade, Miniature Golf, Log Jammer, and Iron Horse on the narrow gaugeCrown Metal Products Locomotive Roster Legend City Railroad. Local kids' TV show hosts Wallace and Ladmo appeared at Legend City virtually every weekend for the entire run of the park.

It is situated between the Coast Fork and Middle Fork of the Willamette River, two miles (3 km) southeast of their confluence. Springfield is immediately north of Mount Pisgah, and the city of Eugene is a few miles west. It is the site of the 2363-acre (956 hectare) Howard Buford Recreation Area as well as the non-profit Mount Pisgah Arboretum at its base. Recreation Mount Pisgah from Spencer Butte Several hiking trails are maintained by the Lane County Parks Department on Mount Pisgah. The summit is accessible by a steep trail from a parking area near the base of the hill. Several other trails make their way through the adjacent arboretum and up the slopes. The summit offers a panoramic view of the southern Willamette Valley and includes a bronze relief sculpture (a memorial for Ken Kesey's son Jed) illustrating the surrounding topography and identifying many nearby geographic features. Arboretum The Mount Pisgah Arboretum covers at the base of Mount Pisgah and offers visitors of trails through natural riverside habitat and hundreds of cataloged plant species. Admission is $4 per car and permits can be purchased at a self-service pay station. Geology The hill consists of basalt or its intrusive equivalent diabase. Small crystals of calcite and various zeolite minerals are often seen where the rock outcrops, especially near the summit. Specific minerals found in the area include agate, calcite, heulandite, jasper, malachite, mesolite, and quartz Controversy Wildish Land Company owns of undisturbed land adjacent to the park and has filed an Oregon Measure 37 claim. The claim seeks either compensation of $15 million for diminution in land value caused by state and county land use regulations enacted since Wildish acquired the property, or in the alternative, a waiver of offending land use regulations enacted since its acquisition. The land is zoned for gravel production with an estimated value, under current zoning, at around $5 million. As an alternative to development or compensation, some have suggested the controversy represents a historic opportunity to purchase the land, integrate it with the existing park, and eventually link the expanded Howard Buford Recreation Area with other undeveloped land as part of a greater Eugene greenway. On December 6, 2006, Lane County approved Wildish's Measure 37 claim, waiving non-exempt offending regulations enacted since Wildish acquired the property. The Oregon Department of Administrative Services has not yet ruled on Wildish's state application. Before any development may happen, Wildish must still receive a waiver from the state, and it must still submit a development application to the county.

The Affecter (or The Affected Painter) was an Attic black- figure vase painter, active in Athens around 550 to 530 BCE.Boardman dates his activity to 540‚Äì520 BC. His conventional name (his real name being unknown today, as none of his works are signed) is derived from his artificial affected style of figural painting, on the basis of which about 135 vases can be ascribed to him. He was active as both potter and painter. His speciality was amphorae. He mainly painted ovoid amphorae and belly amphorae, of the then newly introduced type C. Most of the 132 vases associated with him were found in Etruscan tombs and as such are usually well preserved. He was interested particularly in the decorative effect of his images, composed of stylised figures in long cloaks or with affected gestures; narrative content was secondary. In his tendency to formulaic figures and multiple details, the Affecter is a successor to the Amasis Painter, from whom he may have learnt his trade. Together with the painter Elbows Out, he is considered to be a mannerist of the black-figure style. His images often seem to reflect a surreal world. His figures usually have small heads and seemingly upholstered bodies, when clothed, or angular pointed ones, when naked. His ornaments are very carefully drawn. He often decorated garments with coloured dots. His ornaments seem closely related to those of East Greek workshops, such as the Klazomenai Group or the Northampton Group, indicating regular cultural exchange between Attica and Ionia. A special feature of his amphorae is the replacement of the usual figural decoration on the neck by vegetal ornaments.

It is mostly to the south of Interstate 95 but covers both sides of East Main Street (U.S. Route 1). Stamford‚Äôs East Main Street is part of U.S. Route 1. Before I-95 was built in the early 60‚Ä≤s, Route 1 was Connecticut‚Äôs most critical highway. Its physical location follows old 18th century mail routes and toll roads. It is still referred to in some communities as ‚Äúthe King‚Äôs Highway‚Äù or ‚Äúthe Boston Post Road.‚Äù Stamford‚Äôs growth can be traced by looking at the changes that have occurred along East Main Street. Little more than 100 years ago there was, by comparison to today, almost no development between Elm Street and the Noroton River. However, the East Side ‚Äì bounded by Glenbrook Road and Hamilton Avenue to the North; Cove Rd to the South; Weed Ave to the East; and Grove and Elm Streets to the West ‚Äì are easily identifiable on turn of the century maps. Because of its traditional traffic and commercial functions, East Main Street developed as a spine from which several of the city‚Äôs neighborhoods spread to the north and south. It has therefore been thought of as a corridor, somewhat distinct from the neighborhoods just a few feet away. But it is more appropriate to think of it as an integral part of several neighborhoods, forming a link between the Downton, Glenbrook, Cove and Shippan areas. It is, in part, based on the historic position of the East Side and the natural growth from the city center into the surrounding areas, that this community has such potential. The East Side of Stamford is home to large corporations, such as World Wrestling Entertainment, who has their headquarters on East Main Street approaching the Darien border, Chelsea Piers CT on 1 Blachley Road at the former Clairol campus, NBC Sports Network on Blachley Road, Hospital for Special Surgery - Stamford on Blachley Road and Deloitte at 695 East Main Street. When the Stamford city government revised its master plan for development in 1999-2002 the East Side was considered together with the Cove as one neighborhood.Jaksic, Vesna, \\"Study shows East Side has unmet potential\\", The Advocate of Stamford, July 24, 2005 The East Side Partnership was founded in 2002 to support community development. The organization is composed of area residents, business owners and community advisors with a common goal of representing the interests of the East Side and to improve the quality of life for residents, business owners, property owners, professionals and visitors. From 2000 to 2005, population growth in the area a half mile around the intersection of East Main Street and Lockwood Avenue was almost 4 percent, nearly twice the growth rate of the rest of the city, according to a 2005 preliminary report by AMS Consulting of Bridgeport, a company working on a development plan for the area. The report found the neighborhood has strong potential for economic development, with high traffic counts and easy access to Interstate 95. The East Side of Stamford is one of the fastest growing communities in Stamford with 2 new, luxury apartments complexes and 3 large corporations joining the East Side since 2008. The neighborhood is rich in diversity with authentic restaurants and speciality shops serving the community. Churches The neighborhood has two Roman Catholic Churches ‚Äî St. Mary (which has the largest capacity of any Roman Catholic Church in Fairfield County) and St. Benedict - Our Lady of Montserrat Parish.

Luis M√©ndez de Haro, 6th Marquis of Carpio or Luis M√©ndez de Haro y Guzm√°n, Grandee of Spain, (in full, ), (1598 - 26 November 1661), was a Spanish nobleman, political figure and general. Biography Luis M√©ndez de Haro y Guzm√°n was the son of don Diego de Haro, the marquis of Carpio, and of do√±a Francisca de Guzm√°n, the sister of the Count-Duke Olivares. M√©ndez de Haro made a career at the Spanish court under the protection of his uncle, the Count-Duke Olivares, whom he had succeeded as Valido or the court favourite who enjoys the friendship and trust of the king and who wields political power, after the Count-Duke was driven from office in 1643. He would never exert the same type of influence or control as his uncle had, mainly due to King Philip IV's reliance upon Sister Mar√≠a de √Ågreda's counsel. She was able to influence the king to abolish the function of valido. Portrait of Luis M√©ndez de Haro y Guzm√°n by Cornelis Meyssens Luis de M√©ndez Haro was the main Spanish negotiator of the Treaty of the Pyrenees on Pheasant Island in 1659. He was unable to avoid any perceived negative result of the treaty, nor was he able to reach an anti-French accord with the Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland, Oliver Cromwell. The treaty was accompanied by the marriage of King Louis XIV of France and the Infanta Maria Theresa of Spain. Luis de M√©ndez Haro played the part of the bridegroom in the proxy marriage that took place at Fuenterrabia on June 3, 1660. M√©ndez de Haro's main success was the suppression of the Catalan uprising, and the reconquest of Barcelona in 1652. His campaign during the Portuguese Restoration War on the contrary was a complete failure. Luis de M√©ndez Haro personally led Spanish troops at the Battle of the Lines of Elvas in 1659, which had ended in total defeat. On April 26, 1625, in Barcelona, Luis de M√©ndez Haro had married Catalina (April 26, 1610 ‚Äì November 19, 1647), the youngest daughter of Enrique de C√≥rdoba Cardona y Arag√≥n.

It generates around 13.5 megawatts (MW) of electricity, which is enough to provide power to about 32,000 homes. It was designed to generate electricity by the burning of poultry litter, and was only the second of this kind of power station in the world to have been built when it went into operation in 1993. The station is owned by Energy Power Resources (EPR) and operated by its subsidiary Fibrogen. History After the BSE crisis in the 1980s, millions of cattle were slaughtered, and almost half a million tons of dried meat and bone meal (MBM), the cause of the disease, was stockpiled in secure sheds. Glanford Power Station was re-commissioned in May 2000 to burn them. It charges a gate fee for the fuel it burns, which would have otherwise been disposed of using conventional landfills. MBM has around two thirds the energy value of fossil fuels such as coal, and has been labelled carbon neutral. Despite producing \\"green energy\\", Glanford Power Station is listed as the 27th largest arsenic air emitter in England and Wales in an air quality report published in February 2000. In January 2004 Glandford Power Plant received planning permission for the site to be extended to allow other sources of biomass to be burned. The plant technology is based on a conventional moving grate boiler and steam cycle. In accordance with the United Kingdom Government's new Renewables Obligation incentive mechanism, a premium is paid for renewable electricity generation. Each renewable generator is issued with Renewables Obligation Certificates (ROC), which they may sell to other electricity supply companies. This trade allows them to meet their obligation for the proportion of supplied electricity generated from renewable sources. The power output from the Glanford plant qualifies for ROC trading. The combustion ashes produced by the station are then disposed of via landfill (21% of fuel by mass). Before the switch to MBM, they used to be sold as agricultural fertiliser.

Introduction to the Nine Emperor Gods The Nine Emperor Gods Ji«î Hu√°ng Xƒ´ng J≈´n / Ji«î Hu√°ng Da Di are the nine sons manifested by Father Emperor Zhou Yu Dou Fu Yuan Jun and Mother of the Big Dipper Dou Mu Yuan Jun who holds the Registrar of Life and Death. The worship of Dou Fu Yuan Jun has declined strongly as proper teachings of Taoism degenerate since being exported out of China. Today, most Nine Emperor God temples do not acknowledge the existence of Dou Fu Yuan Jun. However, Dou Fu Yuan Jun is invoked alongside Dou Mu Yuan Jun in Great Dipper Honouring known as Li Dou ceremonies. According To Priest Long Hua, the 35th Generation Leader of Long Shan Men Taoist Sect (Singapore), honouring the Northern Dipper stars prolongs one's life, eliminate calamities, and absolves sins and past debts of oneself and his family.Wu, Jave (2007), The term Ye as in Jiu Huang Ye ( loosely translates as \\"Grandfather\\", a title worshipers commonly use to bring a more intimate relationship between themselves and the Nine Emperors. The Nine Emperor Gods should not be mixed up with the Wang Ye or Princes of the Ming rebels. Popular folk culture has it that the Nine Emperor Gods are actually sea pirates of the Ming dynasty that plotted to overthrow the Qing dynasty. According to Priest Long Hua, this information is inaccurate and considered derogatory to the actual teachings of Taoism as the Nine Emperor Gods are actually high-ranking Star Lords who preside over the movement of planets and coordinate mortal Life and Death issues.Wu, Jave (2008), Celebration The Nine Emperors is formed by the seven stars of the Big Dipper of the North Ursa Major (visible) and two assistant stars (invisible to most people). The Nine Emperor Stars are: #Tan Lang Tai Xing Jun 1st Star Bayer #Ju Men Yuan Xing Jun2nd Star Bayer #Lu Cun Zhen Xing Jun 3rd Star Bayer #Wen Qu Niu Xing Jun 4th Star Bayer #Lian Zhen Gang Xing Jun 5th Setar Bayer #Wu Qu Ji Xing Jun 6th Star Bayer #Po Jun Guan Xing Jun 7th Star Bayer #Zuo Fu Da Dao Xing Jun 8th Star #You Bi Da Dao Xing Jun 9th Star Nine Emperor Gods Festival celebration in popular folk culture On the eve of the ninth moon, temples of the deities hold a ceremony to invoke and welcome the nine emperors. Since the arrival of the gods is believed to be through the waterways, processions are held from temples to the sea shore or river to symbolize this belief. Devotees dressed in traditional white, carrying incense and candles, await the arrival of their excellencies. A carnival-like atmosphere pervades the temple throughout the nine-day festival. During this period of time, the constant tinkling of a prayer bell and chants from the temple priests are heard. Most devotees stay at the temple, eat vegetarian meals and recite continuous chanting of prayer. It is believed that there will be rain throughout the nine days of celebration. The ninth day of the festival is its climax. A procession which draws scores of devotees sends the deities back home. Celebration in Thailand Tongue slashing in Phuket In Thailand, this festival is called thetsakan kin che (Thai: ‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏®‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏•‡∏Å‡∏¥‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏à), the Vegetarian Festival. It is celebrated throughout the entire country, but the festivities are at their height in Phuket, where over the half of the population is Peranakans. It attracts crowds of spectators because of many of the unusual religious rituals that are performed. In accordance with the traditions, many religious devotees will perform ritualized mutilation upon themselves and one another while under a trance-like state, including but not limited to: impaling through cheeks, arms, face, legs, back etc., with everything from as small as syringes to as large as is agreed upon between all members; partial skinning (the skin is not removed, just cut and flipped over); slashing of limbs, chest, stomach and especially tongue with swords, axes and knives; bloodletting; removal of tissue (normally limited to cysts) and intentionally wrapping or standing near fire crackers as they are lit. This is done without anesthetic, always inside or near the temples surrounded by other devotees with only iodine, petroleum jelly and surgical gloves as precautionary measures. Despite this scenario, many of the people performing the rituals are also the people who will care for many of the people in their recovery. To this effect few people ever need to have prolonged medical treatment, and although in the weeks after the festival many people will be seen covered in bandages, scarring is uncommon, stitching, even on individual devotees who impale their cheeks, is rare, and return to daily activity for the devotees occurs shortly after the completion of the ritual, frequently before the festival ends unless performed on the last days, much sooner than before the bandages themselves are removed. The purpose of this practice is a mixture of veneration for their gods and ancestors, to display their devotion to their beliefs and the trance itself, which has a profound impact upon demeanour for days or weeks after, frequently with devotees appearing exceptionally calm and focused in their day-to-day activities after the festival is completed. According to an early-nineteenth- century interpretation of Chinese Taoism by a local community of Chinese immigrant miners, the nine Emperor Gods descend from poles located in the shrine‚Äôs yards and incarnate by using the bodies of the participants as shells for walking on Earth. The participants who prepare to volunteer their bodies to the gods are called the Ma Song. During the main ritual at the temples, the Ma Song fall into a trance and pierce their cheeks with ritual objects, including knives, spears, relics, and other items of personal significance. Then, the Ma Song demonstrate their submission by presenting their expressive forms of self-mutilation in a public procession. In his research project starting in 2012, Schneider identified the affective states of the Ma Song that reflected a religious frame of submission. While in Western cultures dominance is seen as a cherished goal, Schneider observed an unusual appreciation of submission amongst the Ma Song. This might be generalizable to other religious practices where believers submit in devotion. This study has been made possible through the support by Fulbright Scholar grant PD2082693, the National Research Council of Thailand in Bangkok, and the members of the Phuket Provincial Cultural Office. Dr. Schneider was depicted on his research site in a National Geographic documentation by Morgan Freeman. Jeh The characters ‡πÄ‡∏à as often shown on stickers or flags to indicate that food is vegetarian. The characters have been stylised to be more reminiscent of Chinese writing. During a period of nine days, those who are participating in the festival dress all in white and ghin jeh ‡∏Å‡∏¥‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏à, which has come to be translated as abstinence from eating meat, poultry, seafood, and dairy products. Vendors and proprietors of restaurants indicate that jeh food is for sale at their establishments by putting a yellow flag out with the word ‡πÄ‡∏à (jeh) written on it in red. However, technically, only food prepared in the sacred kitchen of the Chinese temple (in Thailand, called sarnjao ‡∏®‡∏≤‡∏•‡πÄ‡∏à‡πâ‡∏≤ or um ‡∏≠‡πä‡∏≥) is jeh, as it must undergo a series of rituals before it can be given that name. Masong Masong ‡∏°‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ó‡∏£‡∏á are the people who invite the spirits of gods to possess their bodies. Ma ‡∏°‡πâ‡∏≤ is the word for horse in Thai, and the name masong refers to how the spirits of the gods use the bodies of these people as a vehicle, as one rides a horse. Only pure, unmarried men or women without families of their own can become masong. At the temple they undergo a series of rituals to protect them for the duration of the festival, during which flagellation and self-mutilation is practiced. The masong tradition doesn't exist in China during this festival and is believed to have been adopted from the Indian festival of Thaipusam. However, spiritual possession in China is also related to the term for a horse. The festivities in Phuket include a procession of masong wearing elaborate costumes who pierce their cheeks and tongues with all manner of things, including swords, banners, machine guns, table lamps, and flowers. While the face is the most common area pierced, some also pierce their arms with pins and fishhooks. Teams of people accompany the masong to keep their wounds clean and to help support the heavier piercings. It is believed that while they are possessed the masong will not feel any pain. They can also be seen shaking their heads back and forth continually, and usually do not seem to \\"see\\" their surroundings. At the temple during the festival there is also firewalking and blade-ladder climbing. While large crowds of people gather to watch, the entranced mah song distribute blessed candy and pieces of orange cloth with Chinese characters printed on them yan ‡∏¢‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏ï‡πå for good luck.

Recently, Chris has been pursuing a solo career, releasing four albums since 2004. Biography Raised in Mahwah, New Jersey, Chris began playing guitar at age 11, but some of his earliest memories include performing the Beatles song Help! for a show and tell in kindergarten. Chris' favorite bands growing up included the Beatles, Kiss, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest and Rush among others. He has cited guitarists such as Ted Nugent, Rik Emmett, Ace Frehley, Randy Rhoads, Michael Schenker as influences throughout the years as well. After only 13 months, Chris grew bored with guitar lessons and decided to teach himself. He was part of a band called \\"Blitzkrieg\\" in middle school and played a few shows, the first of which was at a bar in Ridgewood, New Jersey when Chris was only 13. At the age of 14, Chris and his brother formed a band called \\"Anti\\". Chris graduated from Goshen Central High School in 1984 and went on to become a professional musician, teaching students during the day and playing shows in the night. Chris recorded his first demo tape at age 14 and his second at 17, which got him his first national gig. Chris was in New York City one night, hanging around in a club in the middle of Times Square, when he met the lead singer of a band called Heaven named Allan Fryar. They were looking for a guitarist and Chris asked if he could give Allan a tape. A week later and Fryar called, and it turned out that the band also needed a drummer, so Chris's brother Phil joined. The band was managed by David Krebs and a certain Paul O'Neill, who Chris would maintain close ties for most of his career. Paul O'Neill was later introduced to the Oliva brothers, Jon and Criss of Savatage by an Atlantic Records rep and O'Neill left Heaven to work with Savatage. Eventually, Paul invited Chris to New York, where they recorded the CD and introduced Chris to the band. But, Chris soon learned that a second guitarist may be needed in Savatage, so he learned all of the Savatage songs he could in time for Savatage's 1987-1988 tour with Dio and Megadeth. Savatage hired someone else, which left Chris very upset and he flew himself down to the audition. Chris was given the opportunity to perform, played 2 songs before the band stopped and hired him on the spot. The band went on tour, but Chris was kept on the side of the stage, hidden from the audience. Chris was only 20 years old and playing arenas and was happy, but miserable. He left Savatage after the arena tour. Chris bounced between bands for a couple of years until he came into contact with the Oliva brothers once more. They asked Chris to join them just as the Gutter Ballet album was finished. He gladly accepted, but the road took its toll on the band. With outside pressure to finish their dreams of a band together Chris regretfully quit Savatage at the end of the tour and formed Witchdoctor, with his brother Phil on drums, Hal Patino of King Diamond on bass, and future TSO West member Doug Kistner on keyboards. The band played all over America however the brothers were not clicking musically and the band disbanded. Chris was contacted to perform on Savatage's Streets tour, but issues meant this did not happen. Chris soon learned that Jon Oliva had left Savatage. Chris called Jon, who invited him to Florida, and over \\"10 bottles of Jack Daniels\\", their project Doctor Butcher was born. Zachary Stevens replaced Jon in Savatage, but Jon continued to work with his brother Criss on the record. Chris was again asked to re-join the band, but, he stayed loyal to Jon and Butcher. Some initial demos were recorded with Hal Patino and Gene Barnett for Butcher, but bad press over Jon's health lead Atlantic Records to make a decision - Doctor Butcher or Savatage? Atlantic chose Savatage. Chris was left disheartened. Caffery went to work with friend Ray Gillen of Badlands fame, but Gillen died shortly after the project began. Around this time, Criss Oliva was killed in a car accident by a drunk driver on October 17, 1993.Tony Green, \\"Associates mourn Savatage star\\", St. Petersburg Times (Florida), October 19, 1993, p. 6B Chris was asked for the fourth time to join Savatage, but Atlantic Records suggested Alex Skolnick join the band instead. Chris would later work with Alex on the TSO East touring company. Butcher was signed in Europe and their debut was recorded in 1994. Jon Oliva left to do the Handful of Rain tour with Savatage so Butcher never toured. Chris, this time, enquired about joining Savatage on a more permanent basis with Jon Oliva, as a close friend and student of Criss Oliva he felt he could pay respect to Criss \\"spiritually\\" on stage. Jon agreed, and Chris was joined by Al Pitrelli, a good friend of his from New York. The two formed a steady partnership for almost 6 years, recording both 1995's Dead Winter Dead and 1998's The Wake of Magellan together. During this time, Chris recorded with Joe Lynn Turner, TM Stevens, as well as produced and recorded for Metalium. Chris was featured on Tribute CDs for Guns N' Roses, Accept and Iron Maiden. The Maiden tribute was recorded with Savatage drummer Jeff Plate and his \\"long time and newly re-acquainted best friend\\", TSO member, John West. Savatage was stalled a bit in the recording of a follow up to The Wake of Magellan, due to the tremendous success of the then \\"side project\\", Trans-Siberian Orchestra. Caffery considers himself the \\"ring leader\\" of TSO East when they tour, and he enjoys performing live with the ensemble. In 1999, Caffery also was a member of the German band Metalium. He is featured on their album Millennium Metal: Chapter One, but left after the album and the following tours. Al Pitrelli left Savatage in 2000 when he accepted an invitation to replace Marty Friedman in Megadeth. Zak Stevens left shortly after, citing family reasons. Chris was left as the only guitarist in Savatage and Jon Oliva took up lead vocal duties for the first time in ten years. Chris played the lead parts with Jack Frost (ironically, who replaced him in Metalium) playing the rhythm parts on a short tour with Fates Warning and Judas Priest in support of 2001's Poets and Madmen. After Megadeth \\"disbanded\\" (it later reformed in 2004) in 2002, Al Pitrelli was invited to re-join the band since \\"he never left the family anyway\\". Chris Caffery playing with the Trans-Siberian Orchestra in 2014 Since the release of Savatage's most recent CD, Chris has recorded on releases records of Savatage alumni, including Zak Stevens's Circle II Circle and on Jon Oliva's Pain records. Chris himself released solo EPs and albums in 2004 and 2005, with a follow-up full-length album, Pins and Needles released in 2007. Chris is also worked on TSO's new album Night Castle, released on October 27, 2009. In 2011, Chris released his first commercial hot sauce called \\"Tears of the Sun\\". It was released through a small hot sauce company he is a partner in with Steve Seabury and his wife called \\"High River Sauces\\". The sauce won major awards including \\"The Hot Pepper Award\\" for best overall Hot Sauce in 2011. A second release called \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" was released in 2012. The sauces are gaining a lot of attention world-wide as the venture continues to build. Including. Featured article in the \\"New York Post\\" highlighting Chris's sauce and the first ever New York City Hot Sauce Expo! Musically Chris recorded on several releases as a guest musician. He also toured as the guitarist for the legendary German Metal vocalist Doro as well as a solo tour supporting Heaven and Hell with Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens' band in Europe. He co-wrote and played the guitars on the song \\"The Shadows Are Alive\\" on Tim's first solo release entitled \\"Play my Game\\". TSO continues its yearly Winter tours and also performed three tours for its Beethoven's Last Night CD. The second tour saw TSO cross overseas to Europe for the very first time. In addition to several more guest appearances and collaborations Chris also appears regularly with 18 time Grammy award winner Jimmy Sturr. He also starred as a guest on two episodes of his national TV show. Other current ventures include personal and online guitar instruction, additional culinary adventures, book writing, painting/sketching, photography, musical production and public speaking.

Rhizodonts lived in tropical rivers and freshwater lakes and were the dominant predators of their age. They reached huge sizes - the largest known species, Rhizodus hibberti from Europe and North America, was an estimated 7 m in length, making it the largest freshwater fish known. Description Restoration of Rhizodopsis The upper jaw had a marginal row of small teeth on the maxilla and premaxilla, medium- sized fangs on the ectopterygoid and dermopalatine bones, and large tusks on the vomers and premaxillae. On the lower jaw were marginal teeth on the dentary, with fangs on the three coronoids and a huge tusk at the symphysial tip of the dentary. Apparently, the left and right mandibles rotated inwards towards each other on biting. This may have been a kinetic mechanism to dig the marginal teeth more deeply into the prey, to help grip slippery or struggling items. Rhizodonts' trunk was elongated, with pelvic, two dorsal and anal fins much reduced and placed posteriorly The anal and second dorsal fins formed a functional part of the tail. The lateral line system was elaborated on the skull and pectoral girdle - in Strepsodus the main trunk lateral line also had several subsidiary lines running parallel to it. This probably helped rhizodonts detect prey in the turbid, swampy environments where they lived. Rhizodont pelvic fins are known only from external morphology. They are smaller than the pectoral fins and positioned toward the rear of the body. In comparison to the other fins, the pectoral fins were much enlarged. They had a well-developed internal skeleton surrounded by robust, largely unsegmented lepidotrichia; the whole fin was then covered in deeply overlapping scales. This turned the pectoral fin into a broad paddle. Phylogeny The cladogram presented below is based on studies compiled by Mikko Haaramo for the Mikko's Phylogeny Archive Ecology Judging from their anatomy, rhizodonts had an extremely powerful bite. They probably employed a 'grip and drag' hunting technique, where prey was ambushed, the tusks sunk in to secure it, and then depending on its size, either thrashed on the surface to subdue it, or dragged to where the rhizodont could consume it without being disturbed. Their prey probably included large sharks, lungfish, and other lobe-finned fishes, and even tetrapods, because all tetrapods at this time still had to lay their eggs in water.

Capable of playing as an inside and outside forward, he spent the majority of his career with Plymouth Argyle, appearing for the club in the Southern League and the Football League. He also played for Aberdare Athletic and Barrow in the Football League. Kellock later played in the Southern League for Torquay United. Career Kellock was born in Stockport.

It was an outside broadcast filmed at a big top in a British seaside resort. Originally the big top belonged to various circuses (mainly Gerry Cottle's Circus), but in later seasons, the BBC bought its own to be the venue. The programme was developed by producer Michael Hurll. The series was developed after a short-lived, 6 part 'trial' aired on BBC2 in 1973, under the title Show Of The Week: The Young Generation Big Top, starring the dance troupe The Young Generation and hosted by various personalities. The series was broadcast from various Pontin's Holiday Camps around the UK under the Gerry Cottle Big Top. The first show, airing on 6 August 1973, was hosted by Clodagh Rodgers.

In 2000, he earned his doctorate from his dissertation topic \\"Kazakh-Turkish relations: formation, current state and development prospects\\".  Early career  Before entering the diplomatic service, Saudabayev had a distinguished cultural career, serving as Kazakhstan‚Äôs Chairman of the State Committee of Culture with the rank of Minister, Chairman of the State Film Committee, and Deputy Culture Minister. He began his career as a theatrical producer. From 1968 to 1972, he was a senior methodologist of the Republican House of Folk Art and the director of the Auezov Theater, director-director of the Kazakh circus collective \\"Soyuzgoscirka\\", creator of the ensemble \\"Tabunshchiki-dzhigits\\".

Origins The Mpanzu kanda takes its name from King √Ålvaro V whom came to power in 1636. He was the half-brother of the young king √Ålvaro IV, though it is unclear if he shared the same father, √Ålvaro III. After √Ålvaro IV's murder, √Ålvaro V took the throne. Fall from Power The Kimpanzu dynasty in Kongo would be a short one, and civil war continued between partisans of the Count of Soyo and a noble named Gregario. The Count and his allies, two Jesuit brothers once loyal to √Ålvaro IV, won. The brothers, √Ålvaro Nimi and Garcia Nkanga, defeated and decapitated √Ålvaro V and set up their own dynasty known as the House of Kinlaza. The remaining Kimpanzu who would not recognize the brothers fled south in the county of Soyo. Opposition to the Kinlaza The Kimpanzu retreated to the mountains in the south of Soyo, then ruled by Daniel da Silva. Though nominally a province of Kongo, the county had become more and more independent of the mwenekongo as time passed. Soyo was crucial for its military might and position as an elector of kings. From 1625 until 1641, the office of Count of Soyo had been filled by men loyal to the House of Nsundi and later House of Kinlaza. But when Count Paulo died in 1641, the office was seized by Daniel da Silva. Still holding a grudge against the brothers that had removed him from his place as Duke of Mbamba, Count Daniel da Silva made Soyo a haven for Kimpanzu sympathizers. The Silva kanda became allies and protectors of the Kimpanzu allowing their partisans to plot against the Kinlaza from Mbamba Luvota. Soyo was determined to gain full independence from Kongo and backed various opponents to the Kinlaza including the remnants of the House of Nsundi. This resulted in a failed assassination attempt on Garcia II. The kanda of the House of Nsundi, Nkanka a Mvika, was crushed in retribution by Garcia and ceased to exist by the 1660s. The Kimpanzu; however, were too far from his reach to be taken completely out of the picture. Kimpanzu after the Kongo Civil War Kimpanzu members were closely allied to Soyo for much of the earlier civil war period, and in this time their leader, was lodged in the province of Luvota on Soyo's southern border. They vigorously opposed the House of Kinlaza politically and even militarily before, during and after the Kongo Civil War which raged from 1665 to 1709. In order to reunify Kongo, the √Ågua Rosada kanda arranged for the throne of Kongo to rotate between the two Kinlaza branches and the Kimpanzu. They returned to power with the election of Manuel II following the death of Pedro IV in 1718. The last important Kimpanzu to hold office was the first king Pedro V, who died in 1779, even though his regent and partisans kept up pressure to allow a successor to rule. The line of kings buried in Sembo, whose cemetery was visited in 1859 by the German anthropologist Adolf Bastian were probably other unknown Kimpanzu pretenders.

It was one of the main factions during the Kongo Civil War along with the Kimpanzu and Kinkanga a Mvika kandas. Etymology In KiKongo the language of the kingdom of Kongo, the name of the kanda is Nlaza. The class ki- /-i form, which often refers to membership in a category (and thus includes, for example, village names) is Kinlaza. Thus, the Portuguese reference to the faction as the \\"House of Kinlaza\\" can be understood as the \\"House of Nlaza\\".  Origins  The exact genealogical origins of the Kinlaza lineage are unclear. By the early twentieth century, having a ‚ÄúNlaza father‚Äù did not indicate biological fatherhood, but rather that one was a member of the Kinlaza kanda clan. For this reason, the histories recalled that Lukeni lua Nsanze was the sister of Mpuku a Nsuku. This woman is likely a direct relative of Anna, the daughter of Afonso I, and is therefore the actual progenitor of the Kinlaza‚Äôs who would rule Mbata, however sources vary. What is known for certain is that they are descended from the line of Afonso I and Alvaro III. Their origin lies in a division of the Kongolese royal family into three separate branches, by at least as early as the 1620s. The Kongolese nobility took their descent from both parental lines, and so among those descended from King Afonso I there was quickly division. From the line of Alvaro III came the Kimpanzu family; from Pedro II came the Kinkanga, and, significantly, from Afonso I‚Äôs daughter Anna came the Kinlaza clan, who were closely related to the Kimpanzu, but descending from a different intermediate set of relatives.  Role before the Civil Wars  Kinlaza role in the civil wars began with Garcia II. The Kimpanzu king Alvaro IV granted Garcia and his brother, also named Alvaro, control of the territories of Mbamba and Kiova in exchange for their capable military service in putting down a rebellion. Alvaro of the Kinlaza would later overthrow Alvaro V, reigning as Alvaro VI, and was replaced by his brother Garcia in 1641. Garcia II would begin a campaign of consolidation and political control by crushing the Kinkanga and Kimpanzu clans. The nascent Kongolese church, while mostly consisting of foreigners, was not excluded from the lineage-politics, with the Kinlaza‚Äôs aligning with the Capuchin missionaries and the Kimpanzu more grouped towards the Jesuits. Garcia II was succeeded by his son, Antonio I, who was even more ruthless in the persecution of his enemies than his father. He, attempting to cut off anticipated Portuguese influence there, invaded the Ndembu region, starting a war with the Angolan settlers there. They would engage in a civil war with their sister- branches of the Kimpanzu and Kinkanga. This separation remained an important recorded event, ‚Äúfor even the kinglist of 1758 notes the same three names in conjunction with this event‚Äù (Thornton). It survived as part of the historical consciousness of at least one of the surviving families, the Kinkanga, even as the written records were lost, as a saying: ‚ÄúKinlaza, Kimpanzu, Kinkanga: three stones on which Kongo cooked.‚Äù  Struggle for Throne with Kimpanzu  These crackdowns had the secondary effect of producing a great number of slaves. They were primarily sold through the ports of Sonyo. As Portuguese shipping focused more on Angola, often there were more slaves in Sonyo than could be bought at any one time. This had the effect of often leading the slaves to have to engage in agriculture to sustain themselves. By 1645, Sonyo was a large and prosperous town, rivaling the Kongolese capital. The Sonyo began to assert their independence against the centralization efforts of the Kinlaza, and with Dutch weapons and support, engaged in full-fledged war with Kongo over a period of twenty-five years. This continued to reflect Church politics, as Sonyo began to receive definite Protestant influence, while Kongo remained steadily Catholic. Sonyo‚Äôs resistance to Kongo had widespread effects on the kingdom‚Äôs stability. The Kinlaza had made many enemies with their aggressive consolidation of power, and with the common intermarriage between the nobles of both countries, there was now an asylum for undesirable nobles to congregate. This undermined the power of the Kinlaza dynasty. Vanquished families no longer had to reconcile themselves with the Kinlaza, as they could simply retire to Sonyo and plot rebellion. With the accession of Antonio I to the throne after the death of his father, he failed to cultivate the positive relationship with the Portuguese that his father had. This led to an alliance of the Angolans with the Kimpanzu in Sonyo, with a successful and destructive campaign against the capital, Sao Salvador. Eventually, Antonio himself was killed on the battlefield, sparking an even greater crisis. It was a disastrous and humiliating battle for Kongo, which lost many of its nobles along with the king. While the Portuguese took the royal regalia back to Lisbon in triumph, they generally were not any more heavy-handed in their oversight of the region than they had been before. However, Sonyo, and therefore the Kimpanzu clan, was now able to take the offensive against a weakened and disorganized Kongo.  Decline after the Civil War  The civil war between the Kinlaza and Kimpanzu, exacerbated by these factors, would continue for another thirty years, until Pedro IV, descended from both the Kinlaza and Kimpanzu, finally brought a fragile peace by instituting an official rotation of the royal office between the two families in the early 18th century. The Kinlaza northern branch, founded by Jo√£o II at Mbula (or Lemba) made a claim on the throne, but the branch of this family that supported Pedro IV and opposed Jo√£o's sister Elena in the 1710s eventually was able to become kings of Kongo when Garcia IV came to power in 1743. A southern branch, led by Ana Afonso de Le√£o did not hold power for a long time, and indeed, her home territory of Nkondo (Mucondo) was their primary base. With the declining stability of the kingdom, many of the outer provinces chose independence in the face of an increasingly ineffective central kingdom. One such province was that of Wandu, governed by another branch of the Kinlaza family. The queen Violante of Wandu would conduct an invasion of Kongo in 1764, driving King Alvaro IX, another Kinlaza, from the throne temporarily. He himself had ended the period of alternating succession by deposing \\"Pedro V\\" the Kimpanzu. By 1779, the southern Kinlazas came to power with the ascent of Jos√© I, and held power until Afonso V succeeded his brother Jos√© in 1785. The crisis that followed Afonso's death in 1787, however, left the southern Kinlazas out. The official king Pedro V (1856‚Äì85) (not to be confused with Pedro V of Kimpanzu) may have had connections to the southern Kinlazas in the nineteenth century, since his base at Mbembe was close to the lands of the Nkondo, though no clear connection has been established. After this period, the decline of the Kingdom of Kongo accelerated, and with it the fortunes of the Kinlaza family. The kingdom would endure even beyond the Congress of Berlin until its finally dissolution by the Portuguese government in 1914.

Biography Born in Venice to a Jewish family originally from Ferrara, he moved with them first to Genoa and then to Rome, from whose university he graduated in 1909 with the Hebraist Ignazio Guidi. Immediately after graduation, he participated in numerous research expeditions to Cairo, Athens (for the Italian School of Archaeology), and Crete. In 1911 he returned to Rome, where he worked with Leone Caetani, historian of the Near East, on the editorial staff of the Annals of Islam. He developed strong ties of friendship with Michelangelo Guidi, son of Ignazio and an illustrious Islamist himself, as well as with Gaetano De Sanctis, Ernesto Buonaiuti, Giorgio Pasquali, Luigi Salvatorelli, and the Barnabite priest Giovanni Semeria. Since he had always been deeply interested in religious matters, he used his connections with Semeria and Buonaiuti (excommunicated for his Modernist convictions) to undertake some of the biblical studies he had neglected during his completely secular upbringing. From 1914 to 1916, Levi Della Vida headed the department of Arabic language and literature at the Eastern University of Naples. During the First World War, he acted as an army interpreter, achieving the rank of lieutenant. Afterwards, he was assigned to the department of Semitic Philology at the University of Torino, a post he only held until 1919. In 1920, he went to work for Ignazio Guidi at the University of Rome as a professor of Hebrew and Comparative Semitic Languages.Gabrieli, F. La storiografia arabo-islamica in Italia, Napoli, Guida, 1975, pp. 63-71. In those years, he began to collaborate with some newspapers. He wrote for the Roman daily Il Paese, which ceased publication at the end of 1922, after its offices were destroyed by Fascist squadristi. Levi Della Vida was also a victim of aggression on the part of the Fascists at around the same time. At the invitation of Salvatorelli, who was the associate managing editor, he began to contribute to La Stampa, where he testified to the political climate in Rome in the days following the passing of Giacomo Matteotti. On occasion, he also had contact with various leaders of the anti-Fascist opposition, including Giovanni Amendola, Carlo Sforza and Claudio Treves. In 1924, he became president of the National Union of Liberal and Democratic Forces, founded by Giovanni Amendola, and the following year he signed the Manifesto of the Anti-Fascist Intellectuals. In his autobiography, he claims not to have been particularly interested in political activism; he was, however, convinced that the critical period when Italy was faced with the rise of Fascism required every citizen to take responsibility by participating in political life. In the 1920s, he made the acquaintance of Giovanni Gentile, a professor in Rome, with whom he began to collaborate on the Enciclopedia Treccani as an expert in Hebrew and other Semitic languages.Gabrieli, F., 1975. Levi Della Vida was among the twelve Italian university professors who refused to pledge the oath of loyalty to the Fascist leader and regime imposed by article 18 of the Ordinary Law on 28 August 1931. Because of this refusal, Della Vida was expelled from his post at the university in 1932.Goetz, H.

Preferirei di no. le storie dei dodici professori che si opposero a Mussolini, Torino, Einaudi, 2001. He continued, however, his collaboration with the Enciclopedia Treccani, for which he edited the entry on Hebraism, among the many he completed. At this time, he was assigned by the Vatican Library to catalog its wealth of Arabic manuscripts, from which he culled a first selection for publication in 1935, followed by a second one thirty years later.Gabrieli, F. Orientalisti del Novecento, Roma, Istituto per l'Oriente C. A. Nallino, 1993, pp. 33-38. After the promulgation of the racial laws in 1939, he fled to the United States where he was offered teaching posts at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia as well as at the University of San Diego in California.Dizionario del fascismo, edited by V. de Grazia and S. Luzzatto, Torino, Einaudi, 2003. In his later years, he would donate his personal collection of books and manuscripts to the library at the latter institution, as a token of thankfulness for the hospitality and tenure received there. He returned to Italy in 1945, where he was reinstated to his post at the University of Rome, teaching Muslim history and culture until his retirement in 1959. In 1947. he was elected a member of the Accademia dei Lincei. Levi Della Vida died in Rome in 1967 after a brief illness. The University of California Los Angeles has created an editorial series in his name, The Giorgio Levi Della Vida Series in Islamic Studies, which joins the Giorgio Levi Della Vida Award (a bursary) in recognising exceptional scholarly work on Islamic studies. He also played an indirect but potentially important part in establishing contemporary generative linguistics and cognitive science‚ÄîNoam Chomsky has credited Levi Della Vida with helping to stimulate his early interest in linguistics as an undergraduate, describing his course as 'the one freshman course that I found really engaging'.Item on the LINGUIST List, the international online community of professional linguists.

Scots law At the Scottish Reformation in 1560, the system of consistorial courts where bishops exercised their civil jurisdiction over executry and matrimonial cases broke down. This led to such confusion that Commissary Courts were re-established between 1564 and 1566. The Commissary Court of Edinburgh was the principal court. This court had exclusive jurisdiction in marriage, divorce and bastardy, and a general jurisdiction in the same areas as the old courts. It also held local jurisdiction over the Lothians, Peebles and part of Stirlingshire. There was a limited right of appeal to the Court of Session. There were inferior Commissary Courts, with a jurisdiction based on that of the pre-Reformation episcopal diocese mainly in relation to testaments. They also had jurisdiction in actions of slander, the authentication of tutorial and curatorial inventories, actions for aliment and actions for debt up to a limit of ¬£40 Scots. The courts largely adopted the old canon law, except where this was contrary to the reformed religion. In 1823 the inferior commissary courts powers were transferred to the sheriffs, although the Edinburgh court survived until 1836. The Commissary Court of Edinburgh was abolished in 1830 and its powers were transferred to the Court of Session (except for cases of aliment, which were transferred to the sheriff courts). All commissary courts were abolished in 1876 by the Sheriff Courts (Scotland) Act 1876 and their functions taken over by the sheriff courts. The office of commissary clerk of Edinburgh was retained, however, and the sheriff court of Edinburgh remained the proper forum for the confirmation of testaments of persons dying outside Scotland possessed of moveable estate there. The papers of the Commissary Courts are held in the National Archives of Scotland. Church of England The Commissary Court is the consistory court for the Diocese of Canterbury.

One attacker, Mohammed Ashker was hit by accident and was also killed. The judicial commission that probed the incident concluded that the Indian Union Muslim League was directly involved in both the conspiracy and execution of the massacre.Marad report slams Muslim League The Indian Express, 27 September 2006 The commission affirmed \\"a clear communal conspiracy, with Muslim fundamentalist organisations involved\\". The commission couldn't find evidences to support involvement of foreign organisations. The courts sentenced 62 Muslims to life imprisonment for committing the massacre in 2009 ‚Äì most of whom belonged to the Indian Union Muslim League, Communist Party of India (Marxist), People's Democratic Party, and National Development Front.62 get life term for Marad killings The Indian Express, 16 January 2009 The attackers also threw bombs with the intention of afflicting more deaths, but did not explode.The Marad massacre Outlook (magazine) , 6 June 2003 A large cache of swords, knives and bombs were stored in the neighbouring Masjid (mosque) and were later seized by the police. This stock was found to be kept ready as a reserve for a mass massacre, which did not happen in the event of police intrusion.The Marad massacre The Hindu, Saturday, 31 May 2003 January riots On 3 and 4 January 2002 at Marad, three Hindus and two Muslims were killed in a sudden breach of peace due to scuffles between two groups that began as a trivial altercation over drinking water at the public tap. Police present at the time stood watching the incident, failing to capture the criminals. Out of 393 people arrested, 213 were from Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), 86 from Muslim League, 78 from Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)) and Communist Party of India (CPI), and couple of them from Indian National League (INL), National Development Front (NDF) ‚Äì now renamed \\"Popular Front of India\\" and rest of the parties.

One convict, who has already served five years in jail, was released. Marad massacre On 2 May 2003, in the early evening, eight Hindus were hacked to death by a Muslim mob on the beach after reeling in their catch for the day. The killers then escaped into the local Juma Masjid, the Marad enquiry commission's (Justice Thomas P Joseph) report notes the submission of then Kozhikode Police Commissioner T K Vinod Kumar that hundreds of local Muslim women converged on the mosque to prevent the police from entering it to catch the attackers Initial investigation report of the Crime Branch Inspector General of Police, Mahesh Kumar Singhla, had dropped enough hints that the NDF was behind the massacre of eight people at Marad on 2 May.NDF behind Marad massacre?. Mahesh Kumar Singhla was not able to give enough evidences in front of Thomas P Joseph commission on his arguments. Later, the government troops unearthed a huge cache of weapons including 17 bombs. The police commissioner, TK Vinod Kumar stated: \\"It was an operation carried out by a well-knit organization. It was a quick and sudden attack which was over in 10 minutes. The attack came from a particular community.\\".Weapons seized One of the attackers, Mohammed Ashker, also killed during the incident. The police recovered explosives and arms from the local Juma Masjid two days after the killings as well as special investigation team of the Kerala Crime Branch filed charge sheets against 147 people accused of involvement or complicity in the crime. Aftermath and exodus of residents The Marad killings created an insecure state for the inhabitants of Marad and it still continues. Police, Judiciary and Legislature are indefinitely dragging the case and they are unable to bring the criminals of first and second Marad killings in front of police in spite of continuous requests from different sects. The judiciary is dragging the case indefinitely by not convicting all the 134 arrested person, in spite of continuous requests. This is greatly criticised by all the concerned parties. Commission of Inquiry by Justice Thomas P Joseph The Marad Massacre had caused a public uproar against the apathetic approach of the investigating agency and mushrooming of a new breed of religious fundamentalism in the Kerala State. There were persistent demands for a judicial enquiry in the matter, in pursuance whereto, the then UDF government had appointed Thomas P. Joseph (District & Sessions Judge) as the Commission of Inquiry. He had submitted his report during February 2006 and the LDF ministry tabled the report during September 2006. The report had elucidated that a person known as \\"F.M.\\" (Finance Minister) had funded for the massacre and also cast aspersions on various political parties and the government officials including the District Collector T. O. Sooraj Mohamed. A person named Hilal Mohammed (F.M. who was handling the smuggling of counterfeit goods at Calicut Airport) too has filed a petition demanding a probe into his alleged involvement in the matter. Both these petitions were filed through Advocate S. K. Premraj. During hearing, Advocate Premraj submitted that Hilal Mohammed's life is under imminent threat. The role of Indian Union Muslim Leader P. P. Modieen Koya and Mayin Haji (then chairman Kozhikode Development Authority)was also highlighted in the report. The commission's also recommends a further inquiry, involving the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) about the involvement of foreign agencies in the riots. The commission has taken a serious note of the deposition of state DGP K J Joseph, that the then Assistant Commissioner of Police (Kozhikode) Abdul Rahim \\"failed to investigate and take prompt action in Marad.\\" The DGP deposed that Rahim not only '‚Äòhid the truth from his superior officers'‚Äô but also tried to establish that the key accused in the massacre on the beach on 2 May 2003 were not guilty. Key findings of Justice Thomas P Joseph Commission *\\"The patrolling and search for weapons said to be made by the local police were not effective or purposeful. To put shortly, the local police was lethargic in their attitude towards the situation at Marad Beach.\\" (chapter 5, section 37) *\\"It was unfortunate that the household items were damaged at Marad Beach in the presence of police\\"(chapter 5, section 42) * Coming in for strong indictment is then Kozhikode District Collector T. O. Sooraj Mohamed, currently director of Industries for colluding with Muslim League leadership in covering up facts. The commission has observed that allegations that the Collector was a communalist cannot be dismissed as untrue. The Collector had taken custody of the mosque from where the police had seized lethal weapons. But, the commission noted, he allowed top Muslim League leader E. Ahmed, then an MP and now Minister of State for External Affairs, to enter the mosque (The local Juma Masjid mentioned earlier in the article) and offer prayers, even as an explosive situation prevailed in the area * The then Chief Minister A. K. Antony and the then industries minister and Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) leader P. K. Kunhalikutty opposed any CBI probe into the massacre.Kerala tables Marad massacre report By IANS, Wednesday, 27 September 2006, 12:30 IST * The report mentions about the role of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) and the National Development Front (NDF). IUML leaders like C. Mayin Haji and P. P. Moideen Koya were named to be aware of the conspiracy beforehand. Commission's main recommendation The commission's main recommendation, was a further inquiry, involving the Intelligence Bureau (IB), the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, into the \\"larger conspiracy\\" involving fundamentalist and other forces, and into the source of the explosives and funds that the CBCID \\"failed or refused\\" to investigate ‚Äì an act that the commission described as \\"quite suspicious and disturbing\\". Responses on commission's report The Home minister of Kerala Government had written to the Union Government on 12 September 2006 recommending the CBI probe into the conspiracy behind the riots and issues such as the involvement of fundamentalist outfits, their foreign connections and source of funding and how they succeeded in secretly stockpiling weapons in the village for use in the riots.CBI probe into Marad carnage ‚Äì kerala.gov A.K. Antony, who was the Chief Minister during both incidents, differed on Commission findings with a main point that the first round of violence should have included in the report.  Sentencing  Special court in Kozhikode on 15 January 2009 sentenced 62 of the 63 convicts to life in the May 2003 Marad carnage case. The case relates to the murder of eight Hindu fishermen by an armed mob at Marad beach on the night of 2 May 2003. One of the assailants was also killed during the attack. There were a total of 139 accused in the case. In December 2008, additional sessions Judge Babu Mathew P Joseph convicted 62 people for murder while a person was found guilty of abetment. The rest were acquitted of all charges. Renewed demands for CBI probe On 17 April 2012, Kerala High Court observed that there had been \\"deep conspiracy\\" behind the incident and that police had failed in investigating it effectively. The Opposition leader VS Achuthanandan accused Chief Minister Oommen Chandy of trying to sabotage the Marad massacre case. BJP and Hindu Aikya Vedi and CPI(M)'s State secretariat member Elamaram Kareem also called for a probe by the Central agency. Achuthanandan accused Chandy's Congress-led UDF, which is in coalition with Indian Union Muslim League, of having intervened in the Marad massacre case. Kerala BJP president V Muraleedharan wanted initiation of a case against senior Muslim League leader MC Mayin Haji who had prior knowledge of massacre plan, according to the Judicial Commission.

Hilarion of Makariopolis ( Ilarion Makariopolski, , born Stoyan Stoyanov Mihaylovski, ; 1812‚Äì1875) was a 19th-century Bulgarian cleric and one of the leaders of the struggle for an autonomous Bulgarian church. Born in Elena in 1812 in a prominent Bulgarian family, Mihaylovski received a substantial schooling for the period, initially in his native town and later at the Greek school in Arbanasi. He became a monk in the Hilandar Monastery on Mount Athos in 1832 and continued his education at the school of noted Greek enlightener Theophilos Kairis on the island of Andros, later studying for two years at a famous high school in Athens. A close friend of Georgi Rakovski, Ilarion Makariopolski took an active part in the Macedonian revolutionary society. Since 1844 he guided the Bulgarian church struggle from Constantinople together with Neofit Bozveli, and was exiled to Mount Athos between 1845 and 1850. On 3 April 1860, during Easter service in Constantinople, Ilarion intentionally did not mention the name of the Patriarch of Constantinople, which, according to the canon law, is an act of throwing off his authority. A decision of the Patriarchate sent Makariopolski back to Mount Athos into exile in 1861‚Äì1864 together with the bishops that supported him, Auxentius of Veles and Paisius of Plovdiv. After the Ottoman government of Abd√ºlaziz granted the right to establish an autonomous Bulgarian Exarchate for the Bulgarian dioceses under the Sultan's firman promulgated on February 28 (the Julian calendar), 1870, Ilarion was a member of the Provisional Mixed Exarchic Council and of the first Synod. Upon the unilateral declaration by Antim I of an independent national church of the Bulgarians in May 1872, Ilarion was anathematized by the Patriarchal Synod. The condemnation was later affirmed at the Council in Constantinople in September the same year. Since 1872 he was Metropolitan of Tarnovo, and died in Constantinople on 4 June 1875. He was buried in the yard of the Bulgarian St Stephen Church in the city. Ilarion Ridge in Breznik Heights on Greenwich Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named for Ilarion Makariopolski.

Examples of events leading to disenfranchised grief are the death of a friend, the loss of a pet, a trauma in the family a generation prior,https://doi.org/10.2190/IL.16.4.aa the loss of a home or place of residence particularly in the case of children, who generally have little or no control in such situations, and whose grief may not be noticed or understood by caregivers; American military children and teens in particular move a great deal while growing up, an aborted/miscarried pregnancy, a mother's loss or surrender of a child to adoption, a child's loss of their birth mother to adoption, the death of a loved one due to a socially unacceptable cause such as suicide, or the death of a celebrity. Certain events that are often circumscribed by social stigma can also cause disenfranchised grief, such as the breakup or loss of a secret relationship (e.g. an extramarital affair), botched cosmetic surgery procedures, the diagnosis of a sexually transmitted infection, loss of a job, as well as other events. Traditional forms of grief are more widely recognized even in nontraditional living situations. However, there are few support systems, rituals, traditions, or institutions such as bereavement leave available to those experiencing disenfranchised grief. Even widely recognized forms of grief can become disenfranchised when well-meaning friends and family attempt to set a time limit on a bereaved person's right to grieve. For example, the need to regulate mourning and restore a state of normal work activity severely impacted the grieving process of victims of the Oklahoma City bombing, according to American scholar Edward Linenthal. Grieving for deceased children was redefined as post-traumatic stress disorder if parents were not \\"over it\\" within two weeks.Linenthal, Edward, The Unfinished Bombing, Oklahoma City in American Memory (Oxford Univ. Press, 2001), pp. 94-98.  Loss  Loss is one of the most common experiences that brings about grieving, and although this is often viewed as normal, there are times when it is disqualified. Some examples of when grieving over a loss is disenfranchised include: the loss of a grandchild, of an ex-spouse, of a sibling, or of a child through adoption. Loss of a grandchild can be extremely difficult for a grandparent, but the grandparent's grief is often disenfranchised because they are not part of the immediate family. Attention and support is given to the child's parents and siblings, but the grandparent's grief is two-fold as they have not only grieving the loss of their grandchild, but are also grieving for their adult children who have lost the child. This phenomenon is termed \\"double-grief\\" by Davidson and she explains that this makes bereavement even more difficult. Loss of an ex-spouse is disenfranchised due to the lack of a current or ongoing personal relationship between the former couple. Although the marriage has ended, the relationship has not, and there are ties between the two people that will forever be there including: shared children, mutual friendships, and financial connections. Research has shown that those couples who never resolved conflicts after the relationship ended experienced much more grief than those who had. The grievers experience guilt and thoughts of \\"what might have been\\", similar to those of widows. Loss of a child by adoption is often disenfranchised because the decision to give a child up for adoption is voluntary, and therefore it is not acceptable by society to grieve. Birth mothers lack support, and are expected to just move on and pretend the child does not exist. Many birth mothers experience regret and have thoughts of what might have been or of reuniting with the child. Relationships Many types of relationships are not legitimized by society; therefore when one person in the relationship dies, the other may not have their grief legitimized and it can become disenfranchised. For example, following the death of a partner in a homosexual relationship, societal supports can tend prioritize the immediate family, invalidating the significance of the romantic relationship and loss for the grieving partner (McNutt & Yakushko, 2013). Another example may be a former partner, such as the death of an ex-spouse (a person who the griever was previously married to, but eventually divorced). The death of an ex-spouse does not typically receive the same recognition as the death of a current spouse. Another type of relationship is one in which the griever and the person who died did not necessarily have a close personal relationship. This relationship may include coworkers, doctor and nurse relationships with patients, or even people that the griever does not know personally at all, such as celebrities. Relationships formed online are often not recognized or validated by society, for example where friendships are made through online games and social media. However, when one person dies, the griever or person that did not die in the relationship will often experience disenfranchised grief (Doka, 1989). Responses There are many models for dealing with grief. The Kubler-Ross model describes grieving in five steps or stages: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance (Kubler-Ross, 1969). In other words, in order to begin grieving one must first endorse the loss, and then express emotion. The griever must then accept the loss and adjust to the change the death or loss caused in his or her life (Cordaro, 2012). Over the years, however, how grief is conceptualised has moved away from predictable stages that lead to 'recovery' or 'closure', towards an understanding of grief that addresses the complexity and diversity of the grieving experience (Australian Psychological Society, 2016). Models such as Worden's tasks of grief (2008) and the dual-process model (Stroebe and Schutt, 1999) offer frameworks for dealing with grief in a way that enhances the self awareness of the grieving person (Australian Psychological Society, 2016). Disenfranchised grief presents some complications that are not always present in other grieving processes. First, there are usually intensified reactions to death or loss. For example, the griever may become more depressed or angry due to not being able to fully express his or her grief. Secondly, disenfranchised grief means society does not recognize the death or loss; therefore, the griever does not receive strong social support and may be isolated. As disenfranchised grief is not legitimized by others, the bereaved person may be denied access to rituals, ceremonies, or the right to express their thoughts and emotions (McKissock & McKissock, 1998). When supporting someone through disenfranchised grief it is important to acknowledge and validate their loss and grief (McKissock & McKissock, 1998).

Like all stink badgers, the Palawan stink badger was once thought to share a more recent common ancestor with badgers than with skunks. Recent genetic evidence, however, has led to their re-classification as one of the Mephitidae, the skunk family of mammals. It is the size of a large skunk or small badger, and uses its badger- like body to dig by night for invertebrates in open areas near patches of brush. While it lacks the whitish dorsal patches typical of its closest relatives, predators and hunters generally avoid the powerful noxious chemicals it can spray from the specialized anal glands characteristic of mephitids. Description Although smaller than true badgers, the Palawan stink badger is one of the larger members of the skunk family, the Mephitidae. Adults measure in length, about the same size as the striped skunk native to North America, and weigh anything from . In physical appearance, however, they more closely resemble badgers than skunks. They have a pointed snout with a mobile nose, and a stocky body with short and powerful limbs bearing sharply recurved claws. The tail is very short in comparison to the body, measuring only , and lacking the bushy fur of many skunks. The ears are almost invisible, with only vestigial pinnae, and the eyes are also relatively small. The fur is dark brown to black over most of the body, fading to a more brownish colour on the underparts. There are also scattered white hairs across the back and over the forehead, but not the white stripe and head-patch found on the closely related Sunda stink badger. Compared with its sister species, the Palawan stink badger is also slightly smaller, with larger teeth and longer fur. Females have six teats. Like all members of the mammalia class, the Palawan stink badgers are endothermic, wherein they use metabolically generated heat to regulate body temperature independently of ambient temperature. Another interesting physical feature, is that they are bilaterally symmetric.Neal, E., C. Cheeseman. 1996. Badgers. United Kingdom: T & AD Poyser. Distribution and habitat Palawan stink badgers live on the Philippine island of Palawan, and also on the neighbouring islands of Busuanga and Calauit. They live primarily in the grasslands and cultivated areas on these islands, and use local shrubs for shelter. The Palawan stink badger was described as \\"surprisingly common\\" in the 1970's, however, it is now considered a vulnerable species by the IUCN . It is unclear whether loss of habitat is adversely affecting M. marchei populations, but being an endemic species that only habitat two islands, its conservation is definitely a concern. At this time, there does not appear to be any Philippine law protecting the badger, nor is there any conservation work concerning this species being conducted at this time.Eurs, V. 2003. \\"Mydaus marchei\\" (On- line), Animal Diversity Web. Accessed October 16, 2020 at https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Mydaus_marchei Biology Palawan stink badgers are nocturnal, and feed mainly on invertebrates, such as freshwater crabs and small insects, which they dig out of the ground with their long claws. They are good diggers, and may spend the day in excavated dens. They may travel up to in search of food, and are reported to mark their territory with scent. They are slow moving, and not particularly aggressive, either freezing or emitting a warning snarl when threatened. Like skunks, Palawan stink badgers possess anal scent glands that emit a pungent yellowish liquid.

The Antimenes Painter was an Attic vase painter of the black-figure style, active between circa 530 and 510 BC. The real name of the Antimenes Painter is not known; his current name is an archaeological convention. It is derived from the Kalos inscription on a hydria in the archaeological museum of Leyden. Of the 150 works ascribed to him,The Getty Museum ‚Äì Biography of the Antimenes Painter The Antimenes Painter decorated vases in the black-figure technique in Athens from about 530 to 510 B.C. Working in a period when many artists were switching to the new red-figure technique, the Antimenes Painter was one of the most prolific black-figure artists of his time. Over 140 of his vases survive, mostly amphorae and hydriai. He decorated his vases with a wide range of mythological and genre scenes but seems to have favored two themes: the hero Herakles and fountain- house scenes. As with most ancient artists, the true name of the Antimenes Painter is unknown; he is identified only by the stylistic traits of his work. Scholars named him after a kalos inscription praising the youth Antimenes on a vase now in the Rijksmuseum in Leiden. the majority are hydriai and standard amphorae. Most works attributed to him were found in Etruria. He is considered to have been connected with the workshop of Andokides. He depicted the current repertoire of his period: the adventures of Herakles, Dionysos and his companions, and chariot scenes. He varies the themes, his compositions are described as organised. His distinctive motifs are rather idyllic, often including smaller figurines subsidiary to the main narrative. Examples are a well scene on the aforementioned Leyden hydria and a depiction of the olive harvest on an amphora in the British Museum at London. His drawing style resembles that of Psiax; influences by the early red-figure style are also apparent. Nonetheless, he continued to use the black-figure technique, which maintained many followers. It is hard to distinguish him and associated painters from the Antimenes Painter. Some examples of his later works are striking in the fine and expressive quality of the drawing.

Pedro Gir√≥n de la Cueva, Viceroy of Naples, was given the title of 1st Duke of Osuna. He lost the Battle of Castelo Rodrigo in 1664, as part of the Portuguese Restoration War. He was Viceroy of Catalonia, 1667‚Äì1669, Governor of the Duchy of Milan, Italy, (1670‚Äì1674), when he was replaced by Claude Lamoral, Prince of Ligne.

Her mother was a member of the powerful and old Colonna family. The children who survived, (5 out of 7), were all females who married within the pinnacle of the highest Spanish Nobility of the time.

The larger US components were Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. Operation Friction initially saw Canadian Forces Maritime Command order the destroyers and to assist with enforcing the United Nations trade blockade against Iraq. The supply ship was deployed with the destroyers to provide underway replenishment as well as command/control and at-sea medical services to the small task force which operated in the Persian Gulf, Straits of Hormuz and Gulf of Oman. Canada suffered no casualties during the conflict but since its end many veterans have complained of suffering from Gulf War syndrome.Granatstein, J. L. (2011). Canada's Army: Waging War and Keeping the Peace. University of Toronto Press, p. 381. Gulf War Following UN authorization of military force to remove Iraq from occupied territory in Kuwait, AIRCOM deployed two CF-18 Hornet (24 aircraft) squadrons with support personnel from CFB Baden-Soellingen in Germany to a temporary base in Qatar. Force Mobile Command also sent a large field hospital to Qatar to deal with casualties from the expected ground war. During the Gulf War, Canada's CF-18 squadrons were integrated with Coalition air resources and provided combat air patrols as well as being involved in attacks of ground and water targets. This was the first time since the Korean War that the Canadian military had participated in offensive combat operations. Canadian components Operation Friction saw approximately 4,500 CF personnel deployed to the Persian Gulf from August 1990 ‚Äì February 1991 with a peak deployment of 2,700 personnel during the Gulf War in January 1991. Personnel were primarily attached to four units in the Persian Gulf region: * Canadian Task Group at sea * the Canadian Air Task Group in Doha, Qatar * the Joint Headquarters, Canadian Forces Middle East, in Manama, Bahrain * First Canadian Field Hospital at Al-Qaysumah =Joint headquarters= The headquarters of the Canadian Forces in the Middle East was a joint headquarters established on November 6, 1990, and commanded by Commodore Kenneth J. Summers. It included a communications unit and various joint military staffs. =Naval operations= departs from Halifax as a part of the Coalition's naval forces. Before the war began on January 16, 1991, Canadian naval forces patrolled the central Persian Gulf. When hostilities commenced, Captain Duncan \\"Dusty\\" Miller, Commander of the Canadian Naval Task Group, became the multinational co-ordinator for a large naval combat logistics area established in the southern Persian Gulf. Two Canadian destroyers, and escorted the United States hospital ships, and , the latter with CF medical staff on board. , an auxiliary oil replenishment ship, serviced all nations involved in naval operations within the Gulf. Five Sikorsky CH-124 Sea King helicopters based at CFB Shearwater and CFB Patricia's Bay were also attached to the Naval Task Group, performing reconnaissance, mine search and destroy, air-to-ship naval interdiction, utility and command-and-liaison tasks. Another Canadian destroyer, arrived in theatre after hostilities ceased and was the first allied ship to visit Kuwait. =Air operations= The Canadian Forces Air Command provided combat air patrols in the north and central areas of the Persian Gulf. These patrols worked with the coalition air forces to protect coalition naval forces and land bases from Iraqi air attacks. As the conflict progressed, the Canadian Air Task Group took on other combat roles, such as sweep and escort for coalition bombing missions and later, air-to-ground bombing missions. Canadian pilots were credited with partially destroying an Iraqi patrol boat in the Persian Gulf, and Canadian CF-18 jets carried out 56 bombing sorties against Iraqi forces. Canadian Forces in the Gulf were supported by Air Command‚Äôs Transport Group, providing personnel and cargo transport using a fleet of 27 CC-130 Hercules and five CC-137 Boeing 707, one of which was used in the Gulf as an air-to-air refueler for Coalition air forces.

He played for the Cork senior hurling team for 12 years. Equally comfortable as a half-back or at midfield, Cashman is regarded as one of the greatest players of all time. Cashman began his hurling career at club level with Blackrock. He broke onto the club's top adult team as a 16-year-old in 1974 and enjoyed his greatest success at midfield on the All-Ireland Club Championship-winning team in 1979. Cashman's club career ended in 1990, by which time he had also won three Munster Club Championship titles and four Cork Senior Championship titles. At inter-county level, Cashman was part of the successful Cork minor teams that won dual All-Ireland Championships in 1974 before later winning an All-Ireland Championship with the under-21 team in 1976. He joined the Cork senior team in 1976. From his debut, Cashman was ever-present either at midfield or in the half-back line and made 36 Championship appearances in a career that ended with his last game in 1988. During that time he was part of four All-Ireland Championship-winning teams ‚Äì in 1977, 1978, 1984 and as captain in 1986. Cashman also secured eight Munster Championship medals and two National Hurling League medals. He announced his retirement from inter- county hurling in January 1989. Cashman won his first All-Star in 1977, before claiming a further two All-Stars in 1978, 1983. He was later selected on the Cork Hurling Teams of the Century and Millennium. At inter-provincial level, Cashman was selected to play in seven championship campaigns with Munster, with Railway Cup titles being secured in 1978, 1981 and 1985. In retirement from playing Cashman became involved in team management and coaching. He was an All-Ireland-winning coach and selector with Cork in both the minor and senior grades. He briefly served as manager of the Cork senior hurling team. Biography Tom Cashman was born in Blackrock just outside Cork City in 1957. The son of Mick Cashman and Anne Brohan, he was born into a family that was steeped in sporting excellence. His father was a legendary hurling goalkeeper with Blackrock and Cork during the 1950s and 1960s. Cashman's uncle, Jimmy Brohan, was also a famed club and inter-county hurler. He played as a corner-back with Cork in the 1950s and 1960s and, in spite of never winning an All-Ireland medal, is regarded as one of the all-time greats of the game. Two other uncles, Bobby and John Brohan, excelled at soccer with local clubs Evergreen United and Cork Hibernians respectively. An aunt, Maureen Cashman, played camogie with the Cork senior inter-county team. Playing career Club Cashman played his club hurling with the famous Blackrock club in Cork and enjoyed much success. He tasted his first major success at an early age in 1971 when he won a F√©ile na nGael county title with 'the Rockies'. This was an inter-county hurling competition for players under the age of fifteen. Blackrock later represented Cork in the All-Ireland series and defeated the representatives of Kilkenny, Tipperary and Dublin to take the inaugural title. Cashman followed in his father's footsteps by playing in goal; however, he soon made the switch to become an outfield player.Captains of the Ash p. 37 Cashman enjoyed little success in the minor and under-21 grades with Blackrock; however, he joined the club's senior team in the mid-1970s. He won his first county senior championship winners' medal in 1978 following a victory over fierce rivals Glen Rovers. 'The Rockies' subsequently stormed through the provincial club championship and defeated Newmarket-on- Fergus by two goals, giving Cashman a Munster club title. The subsequent All- Ireland final saw Cork take on Kilkenny as Ballyhale Shamrocks provided the opposition. Ray Cummins scored two goals in rapid succession in the opening thirty minutes to put Blackrock in the driving seat. At the full-time whistle 'the Rockies' were the winners by 5‚Äì7 to 5‚Äì5 giving Cashman an All-Ireland club winners' medal. In 1979 Cashman won a second Cork county championship title with Blackrock. In a similar sequence of events to previous years the club later defeated Dunhill of Waterford to give Cashman a second Munster club title. Blackrock's All-Ireland trail came to an end at the semi-final stage. Cashman won a third county hurling title in 1985. Cashman also played Gaelic football with 'the Rockies' sister club St. Michael's. He played in three consecutive county finals between 1976 and 1978; however, he ended up on the losing side on all three occasions. Minor and under-21 Cashman first came to prominence as a dual player on the inter-county scene with Cork in the early 1970s. In 1974 he enjoyed a rare double in this grade. Cashman began the year by winning a Munster minor hurling title following a 2‚Äì11 to 2‚Äì7 defeat of Tipperary in a replay. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Cork take on Kilkenny. A close game ensued, however, at the final whistle Cork were the champions by 1‚Äì10 to 1‚Äì8, giving Cashman an All-Ireland minor winners' medal.Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 29 1974 also saw Cashman enjoy much success with the Cork minor footballers. He picked up a Munster title in this code as well as Cork defeated arch-rivals Kerry by 0‚Äì13 to 1‚Äì6.Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 154 An All-Ireland final appearance later beckoned with Mayo providing the opposition. The game was a close affair, however, Cork were the winners by 1‚Äì10 to 1‚Äì6.Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 144 This victory gave Cashman an All-Ireland minor football winners' medal to add to the hurling memento he won two weeks earlier. In 1975 Cashman was still eligible for the minor grade. He added a second Munster title to his collection that year as Cork completely trounced Tipperary by 3‚Äì16 to 1‚Äì7 in the provincial final.Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 39 The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Cork take on Kilkenny for the second year in-a-row. Kilkenny were a much better team on the day and Cork were well defeated by 3‚Äì19 to 1‚Äì14.Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 29 1975 also saw Cashman join Cork's under-21 team. He subsequently captured his first Munster under-21 winners' title following a 3‚Äì12 to 2‚Äì6 win over Limerick.Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 48 The subsequent All-Ireland final pitted Cork against fierce rivals Kilkenny, however, Cashman did not play in that game. Kilkenny were the overwhelming winners on that occasion by 5‚Äì13 to 2‚Äì9.Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 42 Cashman was still a key member of the Cork under-21 team in 1976. That year he added a second Munster winners' title to his collection as Clare were accounted for.Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 48 The subsequent All-Ireland final pitted Cork against Kilkenny once again, however, on this occasion Cork had the upper hand. A 2‚Äì17 to 1‚Äì8 trouncing gave Cashman an All-Ireland under-21 winners' medal.Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 42 In 1977 Cashman collected a third consecutive Munster under-21 title as Limerick fell by 5‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì8.Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 48 A third successive All-Ireland under-21 final beckoned and, for the third year in-a- row, Kilkenny were the opponents. Only a goal separated the sides at the full- time whistle, however, victory went to Kilkenny.Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 42 Senior Cashman made his senior debut with the Cork senior hurling team in a National Hurling League game in 1976.Captains of the Ash p. 38 By the time the championship commenced in 1977 he was a key member of the half-back line. That year he picked up his first Munster winners' medal at senior level as Clare were defeated. 'The Rebels' got off to a great start with a Tim Crowley penalty after just seventy-five seconds. Clare fought back, however, Cork still defeated fourteen-man Clare by 4‚Äì15 to 4‚Äì10. A subsequent defeat of Galway set up an All-Ireland final showdown with Wexford. The game turned into a close, exciting affair. A Se√°nie O'Leary goal, together with some brilliant saves by goalkeeper Martin Coleman helped Cork to a 1‚Äì17 to 3‚Äì8 victory.The GAA Book of Lists p. 359 This victory gave Cashman his first senior All-Ireland winners' medal at senior level. His impact was so great in his first full season that he was later presented with his first All-Star award. 1978 saw Cork dominate the provincial championship once again. Clare provided the opposition in second consecutive Munster showdown between the two sides. The game was a close affair and one which Cork could have lost. At the full-time whistle Cork still had a narrow 0‚Äì13 to 0‚Äì11 winMunster Hurling Legends p. 112-113 to give Cashman a second Munster title. This victory paved the way for Cork to take on Kilkenny in the subsequent All-Ireland final. The stakes were high as Cork were attempting to capture a first three in-a-row since 1954. The game, however, was not the classic that many expected. Cork were never really troubled over the course of the seventy minutes and a Jimmy Barry-Murphy goal helped the team to a 1‚Äì15 to 2‚Äì8 victory over their age-old rivals.The GAA Book of Lists p. 359 This victory gave Cork a third All-Ireland title in succession and gave Cashman his second All-Ireland winners' medal. He later collected a second All-Star award. In 1979 Cork were invincible in the provincial championship once again. A 2‚Äì15 to 0‚Äì9 trouncing of Limerick gave the county a record-equaling fifth consecutive Munster title.Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 26 On a personal level it was Cashman's third consecutive Munster winners' medal. After this game it looked likely that Cork were set for a fourth consecutive appearance in the All-Ireland final and the chance to equal the seemingly unbeatable record of four championships in-a-row. The All- Ireland semi-final saw Galway catch Cork on the hop once again. A 2‚Äì14 to 1‚Äì13 defeat ended the dream of four in-a-row. Cork lost their provincial crown in 1980, however, Cashman continued with his winning ways by capturing a National Hurling League medal. He won a second National Hurling League title in 1981, however, Cork were defeated in the provincial championship in both seasons.Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 69 In 1982 Cork were back and Cashman won his fourth Munster hurling winners' medal following a 5‚Äì31 to 3‚Äì6 trouncing of Waterford.Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 26 The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Cork take on Kilkenny. Following an impressive provincial championship campaign 'the Rebels' were the red-hot favourites, however, Kilkenny surprised. Christy Heffernan scored two goals in a forty- second spell just before the interval to take the wind out of Cork's sails. Ger Fennelly got a third goal within eight minutes of the restart, giving Kilkenny a 3‚Äì18 to 1‚Äì15 victory.The GAA Book of Lists p. 361 In 1983 Cork's run of provincial success continued. He won a fifth Munster title that year as Cork trounced Waterford for the second consecutive year.Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 26 The subsequent All-Ireland final pitted Cork against Kilkenny for the second consecutive year also. 'The Cats' used a strong wind to dominate the opening half and built up a strong lead. Cork came storming back with goals by Tom√°s Mulcahy and Se√°nie O'Leary, however, at the full-time whistle Kilkenny had won by 2‚Äì14 to 2‚Äì12.The GAA Book of Lists p. 361 In spite of this defeat Cashman was still presented with another All-Star award. 1984 was a special year in the annals of Gaelic games as it was the centenary year of the Gaelic Athletic Association. The year began well with Cashman helping his team to victory in the special Centenary Cup competition. A sixth Munster winners' medal soon followed for Cashman as Cork defeated Tipperary by 4‚Äì15 to 3‚Äì14 in a memorable Munster final.Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 26 The subsequent All-Ireland final, played at Semple Stadium in Thurles, saw Cork take on Offaly for the first time ever in championship history. The centenary- year final failed to live up to expectations and Cork recorded a relatively easy 3‚Äì16 to 1‚Äì12 victory.The GAA Book of Lists p. 361 It was Cashmna's third All-Ireland winners' medal. In 1985 Fenton added a seventh Munster title to his collection as Cork defeated Tipperary by 4‚Äì17 to 4‚Äì11 in the provincial decider.Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 26 Cork, however, were later defeated by Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final. In 1986 Cashman was joined on the team by his younger brother Jim, while he was also appointed captain of the team. That year Cork made it five-in-a-row in Munster as Cork defeated Clare by 2‚Äì18 to 3‚Äì12 to take the provincial title.Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 26 It was Cashman's eighth Munster winners' medal. This victory paved the way for an All-Ireland final meeting with Galway. The men from the west were the red-hot favourites against an ageing Cork team, however, on the day a different story unfolded. Four Cork goals, one from John Fenton, two from Tom√°s Mulcahy and one from Kevin Hennessy, stymied the Galway attack and helped 'the Rebels' to a 4‚Äì13 to 2‚Äì15 victory.The GAA Book of Lists p. 361 It was Cashman's fourth All-Ireland winners' medal while he also had the honour of lifting the Liam MacCarthy Cup on behalf of his county. In 1987 Cork were attempting to make history by winning a record sixth Munster title in-a-row. Tipperary provided the opposition on that occasion, however, the game ended in a draw. The replay in FitzGerald Stadium, Killarney has gone down in history as one of the great provincial finals. At full-time both sides were level again and extra time was played. Tipp eventually won the day by 4‚Äì22 to 1‚Äì22 and it was the first time in five years that Cork were not provincial champions.Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 26 Tipp triumphed over Cork again in 1988. This was Cashman's last game for the county and he retired from inter-county hurling shortly afterwards.Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 26 Provincial Cashman also lined out with Munster in the inter- provincial hurling competition and enjoyed much success. He first lined out with his province in 1978 as Munster defeated Connacht by 0‚Äì20 to 1‚Äì11, giving Cashman a Railway Cup winners' medal. Munster faced defeat in 1979 and 1980, however, by 1981 the province was back and defeated arch-rivals Leinster by 2‚Äì16 to 2‚Äì6. It was Cashman's second Railway Cup title. After back-to-back defeats for the next few years and a brief hiatus Cashman was back on the Munster team as captain in 1985. A third Railway Cup winners' medal followed as Connacht were accounted for in the final. Managerial career Cork In retirement from hurling Cashman remained involved in the game. He was a selector when Jimmy Barry-Murphy steered Cork to an All-Ireland final victory over Kilkenny in 1999. When Barry-Murphy resigned the following year Cashman took over as manager. Unfortunately, his reign as manager was not as successful as his playing career. Cork were defeated in the Munster Championship by Limerick and were eventually knocked out in the All-Ireland qualifiers by Galway. Cashman subsequently resigned as manager after just one season in charge. It was around this time that Cashman's reputation as one of Cork's all-time greats was cemented as he was named on the Cork Hurling Team of the Century.

CAS is used to treat narrowing of the carotid artery in high-risk patients, when carotid endarterectomy is considered too risky. Uses Carotid stenting is used to reduce the risk of stroke associated with carotid artery stenosis. Carotid stenosis can present with no symptoms or with symptoms such as transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) or strokes. While historically endarterectomy has been the treatment for carotid stenosis, stenting is an alternative intervention for patients who are not candidates for surgery. High risk factors for endarterectomy, which would favor stenting instead, include medical comorbidities (severe heart disease, heart failure, severe lung disease) and anatomic features (contralateral carotid occlusion, radiation therapy to the neck, prior ipsilateral carotid artery surgery, intra-thoracic or intracranial carotid disease) that would make surgery difficult and risky. Reasons to avoid While rates of stroke and death after both surgery and stenting are low, rates of stroke and death after stenting may be higher than endartererectomy, particularly for transfemoral stenting in patients over age 70. Procedure Carotid stenting involves the placement of a stent across the stenosis in the carotid artery. It can be performed under general or local anesthesia. The stent may be placed from the femoral artery or from the common carotid artery at the base of the neck. Critical steps in both approaches are vascular access, crossing the stenosis with a wire, deploying a stent across the lesion, and removing the vascular access. A number of other steps may or may not be performed, including the use of a cerebral protection device, pre- or post-stent balloon angioplasty and cerebral angiography.  Trans-femoral carotid stenting  The trans-femoral route is the traditional approach to carotid stenting. In this technique, the femoral artery is used to gain access to the arterial system. Wire and sheath are advanced through the aorta to the common carotid artery on the side to be treated. Flow reversal or filter cerebral protection may be used. The procedure is typically performed percutaneously.  Trans- carotid artery revascularization (TCAR)  Trans-cartoid artery stenting involves a surgical incision at the base of the neck over the common carotid artery. Wire access is obtained at that location and used to deliver the stent to the internal carotid artery. Cerebral protection is usually obtained by flow reversal - the common carotid artery is clamped, and arterial blood from the internal carotid is run through a filter and returned to a femoral vein during the highest risk portions of the procedure. Recovery and Outcomes Recovery following carotid stenting is simple provided no complications occur. Patients typically leave the hospital in 0-1 days. The blood pressure is kept at a goal below 140 mmHg systolic. Elevated blood pressure in the 2-10 days post-operatively may lead to reperfusion syndrome. The most feared short-term complication of any stroke prevention procedure on the carotid artery is stroke itself. Patients must be selected for surgery or stenting such that the long-term risk reduction of the procedure is greater than the short term risk assumed with the procedure of causing a stroke at the time of the procedure. Other short term complications include bleeding, infection and heart problems such as myocardial infarction related to anesthesia. Late complications such as recurrent stenosis may occur, and surveillance with duplex ultrasound or CT-Angiography may be performed. The risk-reduction from intervention for carotid stenosis (stenting or endarterectomy) is greatest when the indication for intervention is symptoms (i.e., the patient is symptomatic) - typically stroke or TIA. There is insufficient evidence to say that stenting or endarterectomy is better for symptomatic patients. For patients without symptoms (i.e., patients with a stenosis found on physical exam or screening), the benefit of intervention (beyond therapy with anti-platelet and statin medications) at all is controversial.

A porter is a railway employee. The role of a porter is to assist passengers at railway stations, and to handle the loading, unloading, and distribution of luggage and parcels. In the United States the term was formerly used for employees who attended to passengers aboard sleeping cars, a usage unknown to British or Commonwealth English where such staff are known as attendants or stewards,Sleeping car Stewards referenced by the BBC on English-Scottish sleeper trains.Stewards referenced at Seat 61 international rail travel site. Alternative Attendant term at Rough Guides website. terms which are also common in translation in non-English speaking European train travel.See sleeper Stewards referenced at ItaliaRail website. The word derives from the Latin portare, meaning \\"to carry.\\" Hence, in railroad use, the application to someone who carries baggage and parcels of passengers, among other duties. History United Kingdom Porters arose in the Traffic Department of early railway companies, as junior staff grades in most of the independent railway companies. Station porters handled passengers' luggage, assisted passengers to and from trains, carried out general cleaning duties in the station and on its platforms, and often assisted on ticket barriers and in booking offices as they advanced towards higher grades. Goods porters (also known as parcels porters) worked in the handling of parcels and packaged goods, especially in left luggage offices and in relation to parcels vans on trains. Porters were, in most railway companies, the most junior grade of station staff, although some companies had the more junior position of station lad, usually held by a young unskilled and unqualified teenager, who would aspire to the role of porter after training. A typical career progression would see a porter advance to become a head porter, then a ticket collector or booking clerk, which could in turn lead to the senior roles of assistant station master or station master. Other career progressions were also common on some railways. Research at the London School of Economics has shown (with particular reference to the Great Eastern Railway) how advances in rail signalling in the late Victorian era led to a shortage of skilled labour, with many unskilled porters advancing to porter signalman, and ultimately qualifying as signalmen.Careers for the unskilled in the Great Eastern Railway Company, 1870-1913, by Peter Howlett, London School of Economics (Department of Economic History), published LSE, June 2001, page 12. Although porters are traditionally associated with railway stations, the role of travelling porter also existed on the British railways of the pre-grouping and Big Four era. Travelling porters travelled in the parcels cars of passenger trains organising luggage and parcels so that those required at any given station were always closest to the door upon arrival at that station. It was heavy manual labour, but was one of the roles taken over by female workers during the second world war.Women and the Great Western Railway, by Rosa Matheson, published by Tempus Publishing, 2007, , e-published by The History Press, 2012, . Australia In Australia, a railway porter had various roles, similar to those described above. A baggage porter assisted with luggage; an operating porter assisted with safeworking duties; a station porter assisted with general station duties; and as in British usage a lad porter was a junior station porter. North America In the United States and Canada, the term \\"porter\\" has a somewhat different history and contemporary usage, than the rest of the world. Until desegregation had its effect in the United States in the 1960s, the occupation of porter was almost the exclusive province of African American and Black Canadian men. It was the Civil War policy of George Pullman, head of the Pullman Company, who wished to tap into a huge potential work force that was also non-unionized. This eventually changed with the organization of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters under the leadership of A. Philip Randolph. In addition to carrying passengers' baggage to their berth or room, porters also provided personal services, such as clothes pressing and shoe shining.Larry Tye, Rising from the Rails: Pullman Porters and the Making of the Black Middle Class, 2004, Macmillan, In 2019, writer Cecil Foster published the book They Called Me George: The Untold Story of Black Train Porters and the Birth of Modern Canada, a study of the history of Black Canadian train porters.\\"Demeaned, overworked and all called George: How Black train porters transformed Canada\\". Toronto Star, February 1, 2019. Contemporary use United Kingdom Although the role of porter originated in the United Kingdom, and continued after railway nationalisation, it went into decline by the 1970s, with the general station duties role taken by station attendants, and the role of carrying luggage largely abolished. In more recent times however, following the privatisation of British Rail, the role of porter has made a limited comeback, particularly at busy city stations and stations with high numbers of tourists and holidaymakers in transit.Busy Windermere railway station gets porter, The Westmorland Gazette (newspaper), 25 August 2009, accessed 8 October 2016. India In India red-jacketed station porters are common at almost all stations across the network. Although Indian railway porters are not employed directly by Indian Railways they are centrally trained and licensed, holding a licence issued in the name of the President of India,THE PORTER ECONOMY, The Great Railway Bazaar, Mayank Singhal, Businessworld Magazine, 8-15 Sep 2003, reproduced by The Centre for Civil Society. and their role is carefully regulated, with local services (such as porters' offices, lavatories, and canteens) provided by the railway company. Their role is the traditional luggage-carrying job at railway stations.Men in red, The Hindu (newspaper), 7 August 2013, accessed 8 October 2016. United States In the United States the term porter had the somewhat different meaning of a member of staff attending to passengers on board trains, particularly in sleeping cars, a role known as steward in most other countries.

Secular spirituality emphasizes the personal growth and inner peace of the individual, rather than a relationship with the divine. Secular spirituality is made up of the search for meaning outside of a religious institution; it considers one's relationship with the self, others, nature, and whatever else one considers to be the ultimate. Often, the goal of secular spirituality is living happily and/or helping others. According to the American philosopher Robert C. Solomon, \\"spirituality is coextensive with religion and it is not incompatible with or opposed to science or the scientific outlook. Naturalized spirituality is spirituality without any need for the 'other‚Äêworldly'. Spirituality is one of the goals, perhaps the ultimate goal, of philosophy.\\" Cornel W Du Toit, head of the Research Institute for Theology and Religion at the University of South Africa, suggests secular spirituality is unique in that it adapts so well to modern world views, and is therefore compatible with other modern beliefs and ways of life, building community through shared experiences of \\"awe\\". Peter Van der Veer also argues an important aspect of secular spirituality is its promotion of community, creating solidarity through shared universal truth. This 'universal truth' can be experienced through a secular or non-religious world view, without the need for a concept of 'higher power' or a 'supernatural being'. Instances of secular spirituality are mediated differently, as instances of awe can be encouraged through a diversity of unique environments and situations. In the 21st century, individuals increasingly connect with the secularly spiritual through technology. As follows, the connection between contemporary spiritual practices and technology is deepening profoundly. Some traditionally religious practices have been adapted by secular practitioners under strictly spiritual understandings, such as yoga and mindfulness meditation. Secular spirituality affects education, relationships to nature, and community togetherness. Definition Secular spirituality emphasizes humanistic qualities such as love, compassion, patience, forgiveness, responsibility, harmony and a concern for others.Dalai Lama, Ethics for the New Millennium, NY:Riverhead Books, 1999 Du Toit argues aspects of life and human experience which go beyond a purely materialistic view of the world are spiritual; spirituality does not require belief in a supernatural reality or divine being. Mindfulness and meditation can be practiced in order to cherish, foster, and promote the development of one's empathy and manage selfish drivers of behavior, with solicitude and forgiveness. This can be experienced as beneficial, or even necessary for human fulfillment, without any supernatural interpretation or explanation. Spirituality in this context may be a matter of nurturing thoughts, emotions, words and actions that are in harmony with a belief that everything in the universe is mutually dependent. Scholar Daniel Dennett suggests spirituality as connected to \\"awe and joy and sense of peace and wonder,\\" explaining \\"people make a mistake of thinking spirituality... has anything to do with either religious doctrines... or the supernatural,\\" instead claiming spirituality can be and is often entirely secular.. However critics suggest that because 'secular spirituality' does not reference theistic, supernatural or any 'other-worldly' constructs it cannot be truly considered spirituality ‚Äî without some non-ordinary /supernatural element, the dissenters argue that spirituality boils down to being nothing more than a synonym for humanism.  Theorists   Cornel W Du Toit  Cornel W Du Toit is a professor at the University of South Africa, who completed his studies at the Institute for Theology and Missiology. Du Toit defines \\"secular spirituality\\" as a contemporary phenomenon of spirituality experienced in spheres separate from structured, institutionalized religion. Du Toit cites Alister E. McGrath's definition of spirituality in his discussion of the secularly spiritual, arguing that spirituality generally concerns: \\"the quest for a fulfilled and authentic life, involving the bringing together of the ideas distinctive of ... [some] religion and the whole experience of living on the basis of and within the scope of that religion.\\" Du Toit argues that, as a contemporary phenomenon, secular spirituality is different than earlier spiritualities. A number of changes in prevailing worldviews have affected the concept of spirituality. The concept of spirituality means something different in the current techno- scientific world than it did in a world of phantoms, magic, gods, and demons, in which humans believed themselves to be at the mercy of forces they could not control. Du Toit believes that the increase in scientific explanations for what were previously seen as spiritual, \\"unexplainable\\" instances of awe, has increased individuals' tendency to call any experience that seems special \\"spiritual.\\" Du Toit argues that any realm can evoke an experience of spirituality whether it may be reading a novel, watching a movie or going on a hike. Secular spirituality is not a new religion, but rather the potential for all experiences to assume a spiritual quality, not limited to any one religious or transcendent realm. Du Toit argues that industrialism has led to an increase in materialism in the West. Du Toit further argues that materialism has contributed to a more individualistic Western culture, which underpins secularism. In saying this, though Du Toit connects secularism to individualism, Du Toit maintains that secular spirituality is inherently communal, as he argues that while instances of awe can be experienced individually, they ultimately contribute to the collective ‚Äì as these instances of awe can motivate people to influence others and nature. Du Toit argues that if they do not meaningfully contribute to the collective, they can not be considered secular spiritual experiences. Du Toit argues that \\"the spiritual experiences was never an end in itself... [as] any spirituality that does not produce service is false. Peter Van der Veer Peter Van der Veer suggests secular spirituality began with the emphasis on forming group identities, both national and political, and the need for these communities to share a spiritual identity. For Van der Veer, secular spirituality arose in communities through the simultaneous rise of secularism and spirituality, as well as their interaction in the context of nineteenth century globalization. He identifies spirituality, the secular, and religion as three interacting but independent concepts that create frameworks for different systems of belief. For Van der Veer the combination of the spiritual and the secular allows the bridging of discursive traditions in the global-historical context which preserves identities of the communities who share spiritual beliefs across national boundaries. Van der Veer suggests the phenomenon of secular spirituality develops as many different expressions of belief because of the inconsistent integration of spirituality into secular society within social, market and political spaces. Secular spirituality reflects individualism and self-reflexivity through forming group identities outside of a modern geopolitical context. Secular spirituality does not imply rejecting modern ideas of liberalism, socialism or science, but instead exists as a parallel reading of the discourse with contemporary society. Van der Veer identifies the use of these contemporary ideas to create communities of individuals who share secular interests in a system of awesome belief as instances of secular spirituality.  Kim Knott  Kim Knott focuses specifically on the secular sacred, in her discussion of secular spirituality. More specifically, Knott focuses on the possibility of experiencing the sacred outside the context of institutionalized religion. She believes that the sacred functions both within and outside of a theological context through the beliefs of individual persons. Knott deconstructs the common conceptional separation of the sacred from the profane. She argues that the concept of religion should not be conflated with the concept of the sacred, and that the concept of the secular should not be conflated with the concept of the profane. Throughout the enlightenment this separation between religion and the spiritual has occurred, as wilderness sites, marshes, coves, and other sites have been called sacred or spiritual places, without having religious influence or belonging to a religion. In this understanding, the sacred is based in nature as these sacred sites serve in an individual's spatial sacred experience. In Knott's view, individuals experience the sacred through embodiment, spatiality, and the awareness of one's body and the spaces inside and around it. As the basis of the sacred it becomes an operative connection within boundary crossing situations taking place inside and outside the human body and the inhabited territory.  Technology   Online spirituality  Religions and religious movements have strong online presence, which are often discussed in the academic study of digital religion under two categories: \\"religion-online\\" and \\"online-religion.\\" As coined by Christopher Helland, \\"religion-online\\" is understood as \\"importing traditional forms of religion online\\", while \\"online- religion\\" is uniquely secularly spiritual, in that it \\"[creates] new forms of networked spiritual interactions,\\" promoting discussions of ritual and 'awe'-filled moments within a secular, online community. Because of the Internet's ability to \\"cross social and cultural borders\\", Helland argues that this has created \\"non-threatening environment\\" that is ideal for anonymous users to engage in \\"spiritual searching.\\" Online spiritual discussion outside of the aegis of any particular religious movement is often thought to have begun with and have been most influenced by \\"Communitree\\", a \\"California-based online social networking system\\". The \\"Origins\\" board on Communitree promoted \\"open-ended forms of religious discussion\\", resulting in an unofficial \\"set of religious and quasi-religious beliefs and practices that is not accepted, recognized or controlled by official religious groups.\\" Scholars often associate Communitree with personal religiosity and individualized spirituality, as this entirely secular platform allowed for conversation to occur without a \\"set doctrine, code of ethics or group of religious professionals to regulate belief and practices\\". Outside of Communitree, the Internet contains countless forums, websites, and messaging systems. These platforms allow for information regarding spiritual ideas to be accessed, and connections to be made between those who are offering or seeking spiritual advice.  Techno-spirituality  A defining feature of secular spirituality is that instances of secular spirituality can occur in any realm. In the present techno-scientific age, spiritual practices are increasingly mediated through technology. For many religious people, technology can be seen as an alienating force ‚Äì \\"the encapsulation of human rationality\\" ‚Äì that competes with religion and spirituality as opposed to mediating or facilitating religion and spirituality. The recognition of a spiritual dimension of technology represents a recent shift in the discussion. According to philosopher Jay Newman, \\"technology's very success is contributing to the realization of ideals such as freedom, knowledge, happiness, and peace.\\" This may lead people to believe that \\"technology is a proper successor to religion\\", but this is certainly not the case in sociological trends. General levels of religiosity in the West have barely declined since the Enlightenment period. The current \\"attribution of spiritual meaning to the digital realm\\" represents a remarkable change in how spirituality has traditionally been mediated. Secular spirituality is a phenomenon that recognizes the link between technology and spirituality, as opposed to viewing technology as in competition with spirituality.  Yoga  The popularity of the 'yoga' in the West is integrally linked to secularization. This secularization began in India in the 1930s, when yoga teachers began to look for ways to make yoga accessible to the general public who did not have the opportunity to practice yoga as part of the Hindu faith. As such, yoga began to move from the realm of religion to the realm of secularity, promoting Yoga as a non-Hindu practice both within the West and East. Yoga has undeniably Hindu roots, first mentioned in the Katha Upanisad. Despite these roots, yoga has been secularized, and often referred to as being \\"ancient Indian,\\" \\"Eastern,\\" or \\"Sanskritic,\\" rather than as Hindu due to a desire to avoid any religious connotations. Modern Western yoga is thought to \\"not require adoption of religious beliefs or dogma,\\" despite Hindu origins. In the West, yoga has been \\"modernized, medicalized, and transformed into a system of physical culture\\". This system of physical culture has transformed yoga \\"into an individualized spirituality of the self\\", creating an activity that is very popular within secular societies, drawing off portrayals of yoga as \\"mystical, experiential and individualistic.\\" Western yoga students cite health, fitness, and stress reduction as reasons for yogic practice, rather than traditional Hindu motivations and goals such as enlightenment. However, many practice in order to reach \\"contemplative states of consciousness and spirituality\\", a goal that falls within the realm of secular spirituality. In a study of Ashram residents, researchers found residents were more likely to respond they had an \\"experience of oneness\\" during or after a yoga class and felt more \\"in touch with divine or spiritual\\" after a class than control groups, leaving researchers to believe yoga practice enhances transformational processes, including spiritual states.  Meditation  Meditation has transformed into a secular, spiritual experience that promotes a sense of community. Meditation was invented by Taoists in the 7th century BC, while Taoism is regarded by many as a secular philosophy, when it arrived in India it branched out and was soon Indianized and mystified, giving religious explanations for the meditation practices.Homes Welch (1957:152) Meditation is considered a \\"spiritual alternative\\" to conventional values and goals, such as those found in traditional Western religions. Mindfulness-based stress reduction, while traditionally linked to the Buddhist understanding of Samadhi, has become medicalized in the secular aim of reducing illness, rather than the traditional Buddhist goal of liberation from the suffering that occurs in worldly experiences. As such, this medicalized, secularized version of meditation has been allowed into secular institutions within Western society, such as hospitals and schools. Research done at Bowling Green State University has shown that mindfulness practitioners who identify as spiritual, as opposed to non-spiritual, benefit more fully from mindfulness practice, and more significantly decreasing their anxiety, increasing the positivity of their moods and increasing their ability to tolerate pain. The Dalai Lama has promoted global exportation of meditation as a \\"human practice,\\" rather than strictly religious. As such, the secular nature of meditation \\"for the goal of universal human benefit\\" is emphasized, allowing for secular, spiritual but non-religious participation. An additional human benefit occurring as a result of meditative practice is a sense of community between practitioners. While meditation is entirely individual, it also relies on and creates social connection, building community through shared spirituality despite secular contexts.  Education  Marisa Crawford points to the importance of including secular spirituality in the Canadian curriculum. Crawford argues that a push for a secular public education system deprives students of the opportunity to explore life's \\"ultimate questions of heart and soul.\\" Crawford believes that there is a way to integrate spirituality into the secular sphere without indoctrination. She advocates allowing students to investigate how individuals and cultures have addressed spiritual concerns and issues. Public schools in Canada generally exclude the spiritual or transcendent dimension of human life from their explanation of religion and have thus bought into a brand of secularism that has excluded spirituality, giving students the false impression that spirituality has never been an important part of the human experience. Crawford argues that the deflection of students' questions about religion or spirituality is commonplace and contributes to misunderstandings and ignorance about religion and spirituality. According to Crawford, knowledge about religion and spirituality is essential for understanding and living in a pluralistic society. While textbooks include explanations of the rituals and practices of certain religious groups, textbooks rarely discuss religion's role in shaping human thought and action. In British Columbia, the School Act states that public schools must be conducted on \\"strictly secular and non-sectarian principles,\\" thereby alienating young people to \\"questions that both enliven and vex the human spirit.\\" Lois Sweet argues that \\"public schools must begin to examine ways to include the spiritual dimension of human existence in a non-indoctrinating way,\\" by teaching worldviews that are sensitive to religious differences and by emphasizing the features of religion and spirituality that overlap. Sweet points to the fact that the requirement for secularism in Canadian public schools simply signals the need for \\"educational decisions and policies, whatever their motivation, to respect the multiplicity of religious and moral views that are held by families in the school community,\\" not to ignore their discussion. According to a UNESCO report on education: \\"It is thus education's noble task to encourage each and every one, acting in accordance with their traditions and convictions and paying full respect to pluralism, to lift their minds and spirits to the plane of the universal and, in some measure, to transcend themselves.\\" According to Crawford, excluding religion from the curriculum endorses a passive hostility towards all religious points of view. According to Thomas Groome, by nurturing a sacramental cosmology ‚Äì an awareness that each aspect of life manifests visible signs of invisible grace ‚Äì educators can promote an attitude of reverence and gratitude for the world. He argues that doing so can encourage students to \\"bring light to the thousands of wonders and transcendent signals in the ordinary things of life ...contemplating the world with a gaze of faith that encourages seeking meaning and celebrating instances of awe.\\" Through integrating a sacramental cosmology into the Canadian Public Education system, Groome argues that students will have more opportunities to understand and appreciate the web of humanity ‚Äì including love, friendship, and \\"the intricate and consistent designs and patterns of science ... leading to contemplative wonder that is rooted in compassionate and loving relationships that embrace meaningful knowing.\\" Crawford argues that the curriculum will have to avoid promoting one particular religious or irreligious point of view. The curriculum would have to introduce students to a diversity of worldviews and spiritual options \\"allowing them critical access to alternative traditions so that informed insight and wisdom may flourish through the development of spiritual literacy.\\"  Spirituality and nature  Kathleen Fischer argues secular spirituality is inherently linked to nature, and can be found in the beauty of \\"the delicate mist that arises from the spray of a waterfall, a hummingbird hovering at a flowering bush, white beaches bordering turquoise waters.\\" Nurse and researcher Kathleen Fischer notes that nature is a common context for a secular spiritual experience. In her view, individuals can foster a connection to the sacred through experiencing nature with an openness to joy and wonder. According to Fischer, spirituality is the broader reality, the search for meaning and purpose for those who long to discover a deeper dimension to their lives. She characterizes spiritual experience as being rooted in the feeling of awe in nature, which, in her words, may be inspired by sensing \\"the intricacy, majesty, and beauty of creation: the delicate mist that arises from the spray of a waterfall, a hummingbird hovering at a flowering bush, white beaches bordering turquoise waters.\\" Fischer's work is intended to affirm that not only that the lives of human beings, but all aspects of nature, are filled with a sacred mystery or power. In Fischer's own experience, the sacred power of spirituality has deepened and extended her spiritual practices, such as meditation or deep reflection to maintain strong mental wellbeing. Through researching Aboriginal Australian groups, Vicki Grieves has begun using research on their spiritual lives as a method for analyzing and interpreting the contemporary development of Australian Aboriginal groups.Vicki, Grieves (2009). \\"Aboriginal spirituality : Aboriginal philosophy, the basis of Aboriginal social and emotional wellbeing\\". Cooperative Research Centre for Aboriginal Health. Australian Aboriginal spirituality while diverse seems to attend to similar themes on the sacredness of nature that is seen in Fischer's work. Australian Aboriginals are often taught that life is a sacred hoop in which everything has a place. All elements of nature, whether plants, animals, or insects, should be treated with the same respect as humans. Grieves believes that Aboriginal Australian spiritualities deep connection to nature builds a strong community belief system which has the potential to unite all living beings. Through researching Australian Aboriginal spirituality Grieves has noted how \\"spirituality stems from a philosophy that establishes the wholistic notion of the interconnectedness of the elements of the earth and the universe, animate and inanimate.\\" As part of her research, Grieves conducted a focus group with an inter-city contemporary Aboriginal group in Australia to better understand the impact spirituality has on their lives. This inter-city group described spirituality as a feeling of interconnectedness to their people's past, of community and a connectedness with land and nature. It is through spirituality that these inter-city aboriginals attained \\"knowledge, inner strength, and a better understanding of their cultural roots\\" contributing to feelings of \\"acceptance, balance and focus\\" as well as an overall sense of \\"deep wellbeing\\".  In communities   Chicano spirituality  Chicano spirituality is a form of Mexicanism; a nationalist spiritual ideology that developed in Mexico and the Southern United States in the 1960s as a response to political and cultural mistreatment by both Mexican and American law. Chicano spirituality uses a combination of rituals from the Mexica, popular Catholic traditions, and secular Mexican traditions to forge an identity for the Chicano people. Chicanos understand their identity to be that of an independent ethnic minority in between Indigenous and Hispanic people, as such blending secular ethnic positionality with a variety of spiritual traditions. The Chicano identify as heirs to the Aztec lineage, and use this genealogy to justify their demands for territory and recognition in civil rights. Aztl√°n is the imagined territory that is the centre of the Anhuac tribes of whom the Chicano claim to be descendants. Aztl√°n is identified by the Chicano as the first settlement of the Anhuac people in North America before their southern migration to found the Aztec Empire. Chicano spiritual practice includes the celebration of Mexican civic holidays, and uniquely Chicano-Mexicanist rites of passage. One ritual, called Xilonen, is a rite of passage celebrated by fifteen-year-old Chicano girls that symbolically teaches them the place of women in the social order and in families. In the context of the modern Chicano movement, the Chicano identity is used to transcend the modern national boundaries of Mexico and the United States as a distinct population. The territory of Atzl√°n allows the Chicano to justify their separation from other ethnic and cultural groups in these countries by providing them with Aztec ancestors, and a historical connection to territory in what is now the southern United States. The idea of the Aztl√°n homeland is imaginary, but supported by factors in pre-Hispanic history, allows the Chicano to more firmly stake their position to be recognized as a form of secular spirituality occurring in communities in both Mexico and the United States that desires political recognition of their minority identity as a tool to engage in contemporary society. The three main arguments that the Chicano use in their fight for a distinct political identity are that the origin of the Chicano ancestors, the Nahua tribes were in North America, that until 1848 the modern national boundaries between Mexico and the United States were not set, and that there is a history of transient Mexican workers in the United States. By claiming a historical link to territory in both countries, the Chicano distinguish themselves as developing a cultural identity separate from either. Chicano spirituality is a combination of American and Mexican encounters with modern politics of human rights.  Indian national spirituality  English rhetorician I.A. Richards has argued that the lack of a word for spirituality in Sanskrit makes it possible for the concept to be used in a nationalist capacity that transcends individual traditions. Mohandas Gandhi's principle in establishing Indian National Spirituality was that each person could discover a universal truth in the Indian struggle with British colonialism. His vision of Indian National Spirituality transcended the bounds of individual religious traditions, to enact a shared nationalist fervour in the fight for independence. Gandhi's Indian National Spirituality was an adaption of Hindu tradition in light of Western thought proposed an independent India to operate within. Gandhi used the Hindu principle of Sarva Dharma Sambhava which argues that all religions are equal as a way to invite participation of minority communities in his vision of a politically independent India. Gandhi's national spirituality relied on the entire population of India presenting themselves as a united front against colonialism. After the Lucknow Pact of 1916 Gandhi was forced as an act of Indian congress to give separate political representation to Muslims, and later to Sikhs. Gandhi felt that separating them from the political whole was a \\"vivisection\\" of Indian National spirituality as formed a shared ideology for fight for Indian Nationalism. In addition to arguing for religious equality in India, Gandhi's ideology called for the equality of humankind, a secularly spiritual demand based on peace and kindness for the betterment of all. He believed that Indian National Spirituality would allow the East to be an example to the West in promoting national communities tied by belief. Gandhi saw the endemic oppression of the Dalit or untouchable population by the caste system of Hinduism as a heinous institution. He promoted embracing the Dalit population as also being Harijan or children of God, and the British programs implemented to raise Dalit status through educational and employment opportunity programs. = Responses to Indian national spirituality = Gandhi's proposed universalist national spiritual identity for India faced criticism by both religious and secular nationalist groups. Hindu Nationalists opposed an all-encompassing spiritual tradition that accepted Muslims. They believed that being forced to share an identity with a group of the population that they saw as foreign would be another form of colonial emasculation. Another response to the universalism of Indian National Spirituality as proposed by Gandhi was by B. R. Ambedkar in the fight for the Dalit. Ambedkar criticized the use of Hinduism as a basis for a universal spirituality because of the implied inequality of the embedded caste system. He saw the lack of mobility between castes and the systematic oppression of the Dalits, the lowest caste in the Hindu system, as necessitating a political separation from their oppressors in a contemporary Indian legal situation. Ambedkar believed that the community of the Dalit had to divorce itself from Hindu tradition in order to escape caste based oppression, explaining that Dalit problem \\"would never be solved unless [the Dalit] got political power in their own hands.\\" Ambedkar's method for achieving the goals of the Dalit meant that their identity needed to be reimagined as secular, separate from the Hindu caste system. Ambedkar used conversion to Buddhism as a means to promote the Dalit cause through a different spiritual framework than Gandhi's Indian National Spirituality. In 1956 Ambedkar and a number of his Dalit followers converted from Hinduism to Buddhism. The conversion was symbolic shift for the untouchable community to escape the implications of the Hindu caste system on the Dalit population in a secular realm. The tradition of Buddhism was seen by Ambedkar as \\"a guide for right relations between man and man in all spheres of life,\\" embodying the egalitarian character missing from Indian society. He hoped that converting the Dalit population to a religion that lacked a caste system would help to create a situation in which they had equal human rights in India as a minority group. Ambedkar's interpretation of Buddhism was based on a secular and this- worldly reading, wherein suffering was defined as the oppression of one culture by another, and freedom from suffering, and nirvana defined as righteous behaviour on earth between all people.

There have been various corps of auxiliary officers in various institutions by that name. At universities, the term has been used for the candidates for the license. Cursores apostolici This was the Latin title of the ecclesiastical heralds or pursuivants pertaining to the papal court. Their origin is placed in the twelfth century, and they fulfilled for the pontifical government the duties entrusted to heralds by civil states. From the sixteenth century onward they formed part of the Roman Curia in its broader sense, and are reckoned members of the pontifical family. They carried a club-shaped beaten silver mace (mazza), like the mazzieri and the Swiss guard vergers. Their number has been fixed at nineteen, and they are subject to the major-domo. The principal duties of the cursores are to invite those who are to take part in consistories and functions in the papal chapel; to act as servitors in the pontifical palace and as doorkeepers of the conclave; to affix papal rescripts to the doors of the greater Roman basilicas; to issue the summons for attendance at canonizations, the funerals of cardinals etc. As representatives of the pope, the cursores must be received with the respect becoming the personage in whose name they speak, and their invitation has the force of a judicial summons. In the early ages of the Church, an institution somewhat similar to that of the cursores is found in messengers, chosen from among the clergy, to carry important tidings from one bishop to another or from the bishop to his flock. They were much used in times of persecution and they are frequently referred to in the writings of the Fathers as praecones, internuntii etc. As guardians of the assemblies of the faithful, they were called vigiliae 'watchmen'. Despite these resemblances to the modern cursores, it seems evident that the latter took their rise from the employment of heralds by civil states, rather than from the praecones of the early Church. Episcopal courts have likewise cursores or apparitors among their officials. Role in promulgation of canon law In Rome the custom, which became exclusive during the fifteenth century, developed of having the new canonic laws read and posted up by cursores at Rome only, at the doors of the basilica majors, the Palazzo Cancellaria, the Campo de‚Äô fiori and sometimes at the Capitol, as a means of promulgation.

Psiax was an Attic vase painter of the transitional period between the black-figure and red-figure styles. His works date to circa 525 to 505 BC and comprise about 60 surviving vases, two of which bear his signature. Initially he was allocated the name Menon Painter by John Beazley. Only later was it realised that the artist was identical with the painters signing as Psiax. Psiax collaborated with the potters Hilinos, Menon, Andokides and Nikosthenes. While he started as a painter in the black-figure technique, he played a major role in the early development of red-figure, which was invented in the workshop of Andokides. The black-figure Antimenes Painter, working for the same workshop, was stylistically close to Psiax; Beazley described the two as brothers. Perhaps unsurprisingly, considering his chronological position, Psiax was a master of bilingual vase painting. Formerly called the Menon Painter, after the potter‚Äôs signature on a red-figure amphora (Philadelphia, U. PA, Mus., 5349), he signed two red-figure alabastra as painter, both of which bear the signature of the potter Hilinos [Karlsruhe, Bad. Landesmus., 242 (B 120) and Odessa, A. Mus.]. Psiax also knew white-ground pottery techniques, as well as coral red pottery techniques.The Getty Museum - Biography of Psiax A vase-painter working in Athens in the late 500s B.C., Psiax is known from his signature on several surviving vases. A versatile painter, Psiax worked in every pottery technique in use at that time: black-figure, red-figure, white-ground, coral red, and Six's technique. He decorated the complete range of Greek vase shapes, both large and small, favoring Dionysiac scenes and the myths of Herakles. Most importantly, Psiax was an innovator. Two of his vases were signed by the potter Andokides, showing that Psiax worked in the shop where the red-figure technique was probably invented. He is also the first vase-painter interested in showing the human body in complex poses, a trait subsequently developed by the so-called Pioneers, at least one of whom, Euphronios, appears to have been Psiax's pupil. His signature is only known from two red-figure alabastra at Karlsruhe and Odessa, both also signed by the potter Hilinos. Three of the vases by him are signed by the potter Andokides. The fact that he painted kyathoi and used the Six technique indicates that he also collaborated with Nikosthenes. In his early phase, Epiktetos imitated Psiax. The Pioneers Euphornios and Phintias were taught by Psiax. Psiax mostly painted smaller vessels, appropriate to his fine painting style. Nevertheless, larger vases by him are also known, such as amphorae, hydriai and chalice kraters. On those, too, his figures are not so much powerful and lively but rather dignified and restrained. Although he experimented with the possibilities offered by the new technique (perspective), he concentrated more on the fine detail and decorative effect typical of Late Archaic art. He did not limit his activity to black-figure or red-figure but also experimented with black figures on white or coral-red ground and with the Six Technique. His choice of subjects is conventional; arguably with a preference for scenes with horses and archers.

Shell (March 1, 1924 ‚Äì November 2, 2015) was an American computer scientist who designed the Shell sort sorting algorithm. He acquired his Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Cincinnati in 1959, and published the shell sort algorithm in the Communications of the ACM in July that same year. Career After acquiring a B.S. from Michigan Technological University, he went into the Army Corps of Engineers, and from there to the Philippines to help repair damages during World War II. When he returned after the war, he married Alice McCullough and returned to Michigan Technological University, where he taught mathematics. After, he moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, and worked for General Electric's engines division, where he developed a convergence algorithm and wrote a program to perform performance cycle calculations for GE's first aircraft jet engines. He also went to the University of Cincinnati, where in 1951 he acquired a M.S. in mathematics and, in 1959, acquired his Ph.D. in Mathematics. In July of that year he published the shell sort algorithm and \\"The Share 709 System: A Cooperative Effort\\". In 1958, he and A. Spitzbart had published \\"A Chebycheff Fitting Criterion\\". Although he is most widely known for his shell sort algorithm, his Ph.D. is also considered by some to be the first major investigation of the convergence of infinite exponentials, with some very deep results of the convergence into the complex plane. This area has grown considerably and research related to it is now investigated in what is more commonly called tetration. In October 1962 he wrote \\"On the Convergence of Infinite Exponentials\\" in the Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society. After acquiring his Ph.D., Shell moved to Schenectady, New York, to become Manager of Engineering for General Electric's new Information Services Department, the first commercial enterprise to link computers together using the client‚Äìserver architecture. This architecture is the fundamental design for the Internet. He worked with John George Kemeny and Thomas Eugene Kurtz to commercialize the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System in 1963. In 1971 Shell wrote \\"Optimizing the Polyphase Sort\\" in the Communications of the ACM, and in 1972 he joined with a close friend and colleague, Mr. Ralph Mosher (who designed the walking truck), to start a business called Robotics Inc. where he was the General Manager and chief software engineer.

Cheney, Catholic-Hierarchy: Diocese of Agen. Retrieved: 2016-07-07. L'Eglise catholique en Lot-et-Garonne: Site du Dioc√®se d'Agen, Official website, Retrieved: 2016-07-07 (in French) The diocese comprises the D√©partement of Lot-et-Garonne, in the Region of Aquitaine. It has been successively suffragan to the archdioceses of Bordeaux (under the old regime), Toulouse (1802‚Äì1822), and Bordeaux again (since 1822). History Legends which do not antedate the ninth century concerning Saint Caprasius, martyred with St. Fides by Dacianus, Prefect of the Gauls, during the persecution of Diocletian, and the story of Vincentius, a Christian martyr (written about 520), furnish no foundation for later traditions which make these two saints early bishops of Agen.Du Tems, II, p. 269-271. Cathedral The cathedral of the diocese of Agen was formerly located in the church of St. Caprasius, outside the walls of the Roman town. In its reconstructed state, it is a splendid specimen of Romanesque architecture, dating from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. With the restoration of the diocese in 1802, it was again made the cathedral, in place of the Cathedral of St. √âtienne, which had been destroyed during the French Revolution. =The chapter of the cathedral= The trend in the medieval period was for the chapter to acquire more and more of a right, and then an exclusive right, to elect the bishop of the diocese, to the gradual exclusion of the rest of the clergy and the people. This development, however, was often retarded or impeded by other considerations. In the Agennais in the early medieval period, it was the duke of Aquitaine rather than the canons who had the decisive voice in the choosing of a bishop. This can be inferred from the charter granted in 1135 by King Louis VII, the husband of Eleanor of Aquitaine, which restored to the canons of the chapter of Saint-√âtienne the freedom to elect a bishop of their choice.Dourengues, pp. 89-90. When the popes took up residence in Avignon, Clement V reserved to himself the right to appoint bishops for all the dioceses in France. During the Great Schism, both the Pope in Rome and the Pope in Avignon appointed bishops of Agen, but since Agen and France supported the Popes in Avignon, it was their appointees who received the temporal rights from the king and were installed in the diocese. In 1516 King Francis I signed at treaty with Pope Leo X, which has come to be called the Concordat of Bologna, in which the King and his successors acquired the right to nominate each and every one of the bishops in France, except those of the dioceses of Metz, Toul and Verdun. The Popes reserved the right to approve (preconise) the selection of the king, and sometimes they declined the nominee.Jules Thomas, Le Concordat de 1516 : ses origines, son histoire au XVIe si√®cle, Paris: Alphonse Picard 1910, premi√®re partie, pp. 329-343; deuxi√®me partie; troisi√®me partie. This arrangement lasted, except for the decade (1790‚Äì1801) of the French Revolution, down until the Law of the Separation of the Churches and the State of 1905. Thereafter, the popes assumed the sole right to appoint bishops, though the official terminology is still \\"elect\\". =Composition= Map of the Diocese of Agen by Nicolas Sanson, dated 1679 The cathedral chapter was composed of twelve canons and several dignities (not dignitaries). The major dignities were the grand archdeacon and the precentor. The minor dignitaries included the other two archdeacons (Monclar and Marmonde), the sacristan, the porter, and the cantor. The office of cantor was suppressed by Cardinal Leonardo Grosso della Rovere (1487‚Äì1519), but was restored by Bishop Antonio della Rovere (1519‚Äì1538); it was suppressed a second time, and again restored by Bishop Nicolas de Villars (1587‚Äì1608).Sainte-Marthe, Gallia christiana II, pp. 891-894. Ritzler-Sefrin, V, p. 72, note 1, state that there were 6 dignities and 13 canons in 1690. The cathedral chapter, and the chapters of all cathedrals and Collegiate churches in France, were abolished by the National Assembly in 1790. The cathedral chapter of Agen was reestablished in the Church of Saint-Caprais by Bishop Jean Jacoupy in 1802, by virtue of an apostolic brief of 10 November 1802. It was composed of 10 canons, the first two of whom were vicars-general of the diocese. The election of 1477 The last occasion on which the chapter attempted to assert its traditional right to elect the bishop occurred after the death of Bishop Pierre de B√©rard on 21 July 1477. The chapter proceeded to the election, and chose Pierre Dubois, canon and cantor of the cathedral chapter of Saint-Andr√© in Bordeaux, and he was presented to the archbishop for confirmation.Barr√®re, II, p. 148. But on 29 September 1477, King Louis XI wrote to the chapter, announcing that he had named Jean de Monchenu to the bishopric of Agen, relying no doubt on the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges (1438).Durengues, p. 90. Pope Sixtus IV, however, in a bull dated 4 October 1477, appointed his nephew Galeotto Grosso della Rovere as Bishop of Agen. On 29 December 1477 he issued another bull, confirming the resignation of Bishop- elect Pierre Dubois, and at the end of the year documents in the diocese were being issued sede episcopali vacante.Barr√®re, II, p. 148. Galeazzo was appointed Bishop of Coutances on 3 December 1477: Eubel, II, p. 135. Then on 3 July 1478 Monchenu was transferred, while still bishop-elect of Agen, to the diocese of Viviers, thereby extinguishing his claim on Agen, and on 5 July 1478 Sixtus IV issued yet another bull again naming Galeotto Grosso della Rovere to the diocese of Agen.Durengues, p. 90 note 2. Eubel, II, p. 270. The matter seemed to be settled. But on 14 November 1478, Pierre Dubois retracted his resignation, and on 9 April 1479, King Louis referred the entire matter, first to the Parlement of Bordeaux, and then to the Royal Council. On 9 September 1480 Pierre Dubois again submitted his resignation, which, on 17 March 1483 he again retracted.Durengues, p. 90 note 2. The result was a ten- year-long schism in the diocese of Agen, which was finally ended by the final resignation of all his rights by Pierre Dubois on 25 January 1487, and the death of Galeatto Grosso.Barr√®re, II, p. 150. Chapter of Saint-Caprais Tradition has it that the chapter of Saint-Caprais came into a separate existence when the remains of Saint-Caprais were moved inside the city to the new Cathedral of Saint-√âtienne; some of the canons of the old Cathedral of Saint-Caprais moved to Saint-√âtienne, while others preferred to stay behind in their accustomed place, where there was plenty of income to sustain them and where they could maintain their prerogatives and preeminence. There is no documentary evidence whatever to sustain this hypothesis for the existence of two chapters. The earliest document, in fact, that refers to the chapter of Saint-Caprais is a charter of 1180 in which the English king Henry II orders the chapter of Saint-√âtienne not to harass the chapter of Saint-Caprais economically.Durengues, pp, 9-11, with p. 10 note 1. There is also a tradition that both chapters were originally composed of regular clergy (monks). There is no evidence for this claim, and indeed in the absence of evidence it is argued by some that the monks were Benedictines, other that they were regular canons, following the Rule of Saint Augustine. What is certain is that the canons were secular canons, not regular canons, by the end of the 13th century.Durengues, pp. 10-11. The chapter of Saint-Caprais had only one dignity, the prior, and a varying number of canons. By 1311 they numbered fifteen, though Pope Martin V in 1417 ordered that they be reduced to twelve, though the actual number of canons was ten, to which the prior was added. Each of the canons was elected by the members of the chapter (in other words, the body coopted its own members, without outside influence), and the prior was elected by the canons. In both the old and the new cathedral, the prior enjoyed the first place in precedence after the bishop, even ahead of the dignities and canons of Saint-√âtienne.Durengues, pp. 29-31. List of Priors, beginning with Guillaume Mengot in 1159, at p. 33 note 2. The canons of Saint- Caprais had no role in the election of a bishop. Chapter of Poujols In 1526, Jean d'Esclamals, seigneur de Poujols, and his wife, Catherine de L√©vis, in cooperation with the chapter of Saint-Caprais, founded a chapter of canons for whom a church was built, Notre-Dame et Saint-Pierre de Pujols. The bull of creation was signed by Pope Clement VII on 7 September 1526, and it required that the canons reside and perform all of the liturgical offices; the Seigneur, however, was given the right to reduce the requirements, given the needs of the day. By the 18th century none of the canons resided. Originally there was a dean and ten canons, but the revenues were inadequate, and the number was reduced to six. The parish priest of Saint-Colombe de Pujols was a canon ex officio. The chapter of Poujols had precedence in diocesan synods immediately after the chapter of Saint-Caprais.Durengues, pp. 298-301. Revolution During the French Revolution the diocese of Agen was suppressed by the Legislative Assembly, under the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (1790). Its territory was subsumed into the new diocese, called 'Lot-et- Garonne', which was coterminous with the new civil department of the same name. Lot-et-Garonne was made part of the Metropolitanate called the 'M√©tropole du Sud-Ouest'. The new Civil Constitution mandated that bishops be elected by the citizens of each 'd√©partement',Bishops and priests were also to be salaried by the State. A considerable number of priests in the diocese refused to take the oath and were dismissed. A list of those dismissed: The salaries were paid out of funds realized from the confiscation and sale of church properties. After the Concordat of 1801, bishops and priests continued to be salaried and pensioned by the State, down to the Law of Separation of 1905, Article 2. This system immediately raised the most severe issues in canon law, since the electors did not need to be Catholics and the approval of the Pope was not only not required, but actually forbidden. Erection of new dioceses and transfer of bishops, moreover, was not canonically in the competence of civil authorities or of the Church in France. The result was schism between the 'Constitutional Church' and the Roman Catholic Church. Since the legitimate bishop of Agen, Jean-Louis de Bonnac, had refused to take the oath to the Constitution, his seat was declared vacant, and an election was ordered. The carefully chosen electors of Lot-et-Garonne met, and on 13 March 1791 chose the Lazarist priest Labarthe, who was the director of the local seminary as their Constitutional bishop. Four days later he declined the election. On 18 March the majority of electors chose Jean-Baptiste Gobel, but he was also elected by the electors of Paris, and he accepted their offer. The electors of Lot-and-Garonne then seemed prepared to pick the titular bishop of Babylon, Jean-Baptiste Dubourg-Miroudot, but Andre Constant, a Dominican professor of theology from Bordeaux, had his name put forward by the Soci√©t√© des Amis de la Constitution. Constant was elected over Miroudot by 232 to 137.Pisani, pp. 441-442. Constant resigned in 1801; Bonnac was dismissed by Pius VII in 1801. The diocese of Lot-et-Garonne was likewise abolished, and the diocese of Agen reestablished by papal bull.

Early life Meloy was born in Washington, D.C. on March 28, 1917 to Francis E. Meloy Sr. a government employee and geographer and Anne Teresa Connor. He served in the United States Navy during World War II spending four years in naval intelligence as a reserve officer. Diplomatic career After the war, he joined the State Department and 1946 he was posted Dhahran, Saudi Arabia as a vice consul. He returned in 1946 to Washington and served as the personal assistant to Secretary of State Dean Acheson until 1953. He resumed his career as a Foreign Service officer serving as a political officer in Saigon from 1953 until 1956 and then in Paris until 1959. In 1962 he was appointed as the Director of the Office of Western European Affairs until 1964, then as the deputy chief of mission in Rome. He was then promoted, serving as U.S. Ambassador to the Dominican Republic from 1969 to 1973, and Guatemala from 1973 to 1976. On 21 April 1976, President Gerald Ford appointed Meloy as Ambassador to Lebanon after the resignation of G. McMurtrie Godley due to illness. He would be approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on 27 April. Death At 10:40 on 16 June 1976, in Beirut, Meloy, the incoming U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon, accompanied by Robert O. Waring, the U.S. Economic Counselor, was on his way to present his credentials to the new Lebanese President-elect Elias Sarkis. Meloy, Waring and their driver, Zuhair Mohammed Moghrabi, were kidnapped by Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine members as they crossed the Green Line, the division between Beirut's Christian and Muslim sectors. Meloy had been in the country a month but not presented his credentials to the old president Suleiman Franjieh who had taken refuge outside Beirut and refused to step down. By 21:30, Lebanese television announced their bullet-riddled bodies had been found on a garbage dump near the beach in Ramlet al-Baida. In 2013, a report released by the CIA said that Meloy was assassinated by an \\"extreme Lebanese leftist militia\\" that had links with the PFLP. The report noted that the PLO arrested five over the assassination but released them for lack of sufficient evidence. The PLO handed the two culprits to the PFLP and they were later executed, the report added.https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0006116800.pdf See also * Ambassadors of the United States killed in office References External links *Presidential Proclamation honoring Ambassador Meloy & Counselor Waring 1917 births 1976 deaths Ambassadors of the United States to the Dominican Republic Ambassadors of the United States to Guatemala Ambassadors of the United States to Lebanon Assassinated American diplomats Kidnapped diplomats Kidnapped American people Terrorism deaths in Lebanon 1970s murders in Lebanon 1976 crimes in Lebanon 1976 murders in Asia American terrorism victims American people murdered abroad People murdered in Lebanon Deaths by firearm in Lebanon United States Foreign Service personnel ","title":"Francis E.

He grew up in the town of Sandviken, Sweden and has sold 3 million records.  Career  Tomas Ledin started his career in 1972 when his first single, \\"D√• ska jag spela\\", was a big hit. Other successful songs followed: \\"Bl√•, bl√• k√§nslor\\" (1973), (covered by Bj√∂rn Skifs), \\"Knivhuggarrock\\" (1975), \\"Festen har b√∂rjat\\" (1976), and \\"I natt √§r jag din\\" (1977). At the beginning of the 70s, Ledin was influenced by hippie fashion and demonstrated against the Vietnam war. He also took part in a Swedish stage production of the musical Godspell in 1975 and performed in 140 concerts in the Swedish folkparks in 1977. In 1979, ABBA member Benny Andersson offered him a chance to record for the group's company Polar Music. The singer joined ABBA on their 1979‚Äì1980 tour as a backing vocalist, but also got the opportunity to sing his own composition \\"Not Bad at All\\" during the show. Tomas Ledin also appeared on the ABBA Live DVD and on the Super Trouper Video. Tomas Ledin in 1980 He won the Swedish Melodifestivalen in 1980 and represented Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest that year with \\"Just nu!\\". The song was a big hit in Scandinavia, and also in Greece and Portugal since Ledin recorded an English version, \\"Right Now!\\". In 1982, he released the duet \\"Never Again\\" with Agnetha F√§ltskog of ABBA fame; the song reached number one in Chile (in its Spanish version \\"Ya nunca m√°s\\") and was popular across Europe. Ledin also composed \\"Take Good Care of Your Children\\", which F√§ltskog released in 1983 on her album Wrap Your Arms Around Me. Another composition by the singer, \\"I Got Something\\", was released by Anni-Frid Lyngstad of ABBA on her album Something's Going On. In the 80s, Ledin was very successful in Scandinavia but his career abroad failed to reach the same level. He nevertheless toured Germany and the Netherlands on a small scale in 1982, and the following year, he played in front of 60,000 people at the Olympic stadium in Berlin, in a show with other international acts. He decided to put an end to his career in 1984 and started to act as a producer for Record Station, his wife's record company. He discovered other singers and successfully produced artists such as Pugh Rogefeldt and Magnus Uggla. In 1985, he organized a concert for ANC featuring several Swedish artists. Three years later, Tomas Ledin started to compose again and wrote songs in English. The album Down on the Pleasure Avenue was released but was not successful. Ledin was very disappointed but started to compose again, in Swedish this time. He started to enjoy success again in 1990 when he released a compilation and a new album, Tillf√§lligheternas spel, and has been one of the best selling artists in Sweden since then. In 2000, 260,000 copies of his compilation album Festen har b√∂rjat (samlingsalbum) were sold in Sweden, which meant he was awarded three platinum records there. In 2002, he went on the biggest tour ever planned in Scandinavia and performed in 27 shows in Sweden and 8 shows in the rest of Scandinavia. More than 250,000 people saw the show in Northern Europe. Ledin's songs have been turned into a jukebox musical film En del av mitt hj√§rta (A Piece of My Heart), which was released in 2019, directed by Edward af Sill√©n, who Ledin worked with in 2011 for his stage show Showtime.  Personal life  Ledin has been married since 1983 to record company president Marie Ledin, daughter of Stig Anderson. They have two sons together, named John and Theo.

Zenair CH601XL The Zodiac is a family of Canadian all-metal, two-seat, fixed landing gear airplanes that first flew in 1984. The aircraft have been produced as kits and completed aircraft by Zenair in Canada and Zenith Aircraft Company in the USA.Vandermeullen, Richard: 2011 Kit Aircraft Buyer's Guide, Kitplanes, Volume 28, Number 12, December 2011, page 77. Belvoir Publications. ISSN 0891-1851 The latest models in the Zodiac family are the ready-to-fly AMD Zodiac LS and LSi produced by Aircraft Manufacturing and Design. The design has a single- piece bubble canopy. Development The Zodiac airplane was developed by Avions Pierre Robin engineer Chris Heintz in the early 1970s. The Zenair CH 200 kit plane was developed as a Homebuilt aircraft, meaning that consumers can purchase the plane as components to assemble it themselves. Variants of the Zodiac have since been manufactured in Canada, Europe, United States and South America as a factory-assembled, ready-to-fly aircraft. Heintz drafted the regulations for light-sport aircraft in Canada around the time he designed the Zodiac. He also played an important role in drafting the current light- sport aircraft (LSA) rules for the United States. Zenith Aircraft Company still produces kits and Quick-build kits for the Zodiac kit for the homebuilt- market. The company also provides engine mounts and instructions for mounting the Stratus EA 81 engine in the CH 601 series. Chevrolet Corvair engines have also been employed. There are over 1000 Zodiac aircraft flying worldwide. Operational history Safety incidents and grounding = Wing-related incidents = In the Netherlands, the Dutch government grounded the 12 Dutch- registered CH 601 XLs on 24 October 2008. The planes were banned from flying pending an investigation into their structural strength, following the crash of a European variant of the design (Rotax powered and maximum take-off weight) that killed two people. According to the Dutch government, since 2005 \\"at least seven accidents with Zenith CH601 XL's have happened in which one or both wings have failed\\".Inspectie houdt twaalf sportvliegtuigjes aan de grond (in Dutch) Zenair Europe investigated these accidents,Zenair Europe News http://www.zenairulm.com/News/index_files/Page555.htm concluded that none are due to a design defect and, after a first-hand review of the wreckage, also rejected suggestions that the aircraft in the Dutch accident experienced a structural failure.Zenair Europe News http://www.zenairulm.com/News/index_files/Page802.htm On 14 April 2009, the NTSB wrote an urgent letter to the FAA recommending that they ground all Zodiac CH 601 XLs, saying \\"It appears that aerodynamic flutter is the likely source of four of the U.S. accidents and of at least two foreign accidents\\". The NTSB also wrote to ASTM International, the body responsible for developing standards for light sport aircraft, recommending that those standards be changed in light of the investigation. The NTSB says that the type has been involved \\"in six in-flight structural breakups since 2006\\".CNN news story on NTSB letter http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/04/14/ntsb.small.plane/index.htmlNTSB letter to ASTM https://www.ntsb.gov/recs/letters/2009/A09_38_40.pdf Zenith Aircraft disputed the NTSB's conclusions and stated in a response on their website that \\"[w]e continue to believe wing flutter will not occur if the control cables are adjusted properly.\\" They also cited Zenair Europe's disagreement with the Dutch government's conclusion that that accident was caused by flutter. AMD issued a safety alert in October 2008 mandating inspections of aileron control cable tensions. The company hired an independent consultant, Dr. Uwe Weltin, an internationally recognized flutter and vibrations specialist and head of the Institut f√ºr Zuverlaessigkeitstechnik at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg who concluded that when the CH 601 XL is built and maintained to Zenair specifications, there is \\"no tendency to flutter or divergence found within the flight envelope of the CH 601 XL\\". The company claimed that the report clears the Zodiac design of flutter-related concerns as long as CH 601 XL is built and maintained to Zenair specifications. In reacting to the NTSB recommendations the FAA Administrator Randy Babbit declined to ground the aircraft and in a 13 July 2009 letter, stated \\"Data indicates the CH-601XL has a safety record similar to other S-LSA and appears capable of safe flight and operations if maintained according to the manufacturer's recommendations.\\" On 6 November 2009 an amateur-built CH-601XL broke up in flight over Arkansas, resulting in the death of the pilot. Preliminary investigation of the accident revealed a failure mode similar to that seen in the earlier crashes, as both wings separated in flight. This brought the number of crashes to seven and deaths to 11. The FAA issued a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin on 7 November 2009 and strongly recommended that the aircraft not be flown until modifications detailed in an AMD Safety Alert are carried out. AMD and Zenith Aircraft issued documents the same day, mandating that the S-LSA version not be flown until the modifications were completed and recommended all aircraft be modified. The modifications included strengthening of the main and rear wing spar carrythroughs and the addition of aileron balance weights. The Experimental Aircraft Association also recommended grounding all affected aircraft until modifications are complete. In a statement issued by Zenith Aircraft, the designer, Chris Heintz in response to the question \\"Why are you recommending this Upgrade Package? What has prompted this \\"180- degree\\" shift, from insisting that the CH 601 XL design was fine \\"as is\\", to now mandating a list of upgrades requiring more than a dozen modifications?\\" stated: On 12 November 2009 the FAA ceased issuing new Certificates of Airworthiness, requiring new registrants to prove that they have complied with the modifications before being permitted to fly the aircraft. In addressing the 6 November 2009 accident NTSB Chairman Deborah A.P. Hersman said on 13 November 2009: The FAA completed an in-depth review of the CH601 XL and 650 and issued a report entitled Zodiac CH601 XL Airplane Special Review Team Report January 2010. The FAA concluded: In reacting to the FAA's report the Experimental Aircraft Association's Vice President of Industry and Regulatory Affairs, Earl Lawrence, said, \\"The FAA did an excellent job with this investigation and deserves credit for thoroughly exploring all possibilities. EAA had vigorously pushed for comprehensive data on these accidents. We wanted to see the data, so aircraft owners knew exactly what modifications were needed and why they were needed immediately.\\" On 20 April 2019 another wing failure accident in Bulgaria killed the pilot and passenger.

The organization The Chesapeake Bay Watershed is the first to experience the impacts of increased population and development pressures in ways that the rest of United States will be encountering in the coming decades. The unique nature its high land area to small water volume ratio makes the nutrient and sediment pollution flowing into the rivers and tributaries that feed the bay very problematic. (Turning the Tide; Tom Horton; Island Press; 2003; pg. 5) The runoff from new and existing development is one of the major sources of nutrient and sediment pollution. Many communities in the Chesapeake Bay watershed from New York to Virginia are wary of the environmental problems associated with residential and commercial development, but few understand how to mitigate them. Research shows that one of the biggest barriers to implementing more environmentally sensitive site design practices is the existing codes and ordinances found at the local level. That is why in 2001, the Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay, under the leadership of its president David Bancroft, partnered with the Center for Watershed Protection (CWP), and the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) to launched a new partnership known as Builders for the Bay. The Builders for the Bay program encourages the voluntary adoption of up to 22 better site design principles that reduce the environmental effects of residential and commercial development. The Builders for the Bay program outlines a process to engage the public and various stakeholders in a consensus process to provide more flexibility in the codes to allow for more environmentally sensitive development practices. This flexibility, combined with the economic benefits of such design principles, encourages those in the development industry to build subdivisions with fewer environmental impacts. In 1997, the Center for Watershed Protection (CWP) initiated a national site planning roundtable to convene stakeholders in a process to iron out model land development principles. The result was the development of 22 principles (see below), a consensus document and the development of a handbook entitled ‚ÄúBetter Site Design: A Handbook for Changing Development Rules in Your Community,‚Äù which includes technical information on how to utilize the 22 model development principles and how to conduct a local roundtable process. The guidance was based on the idea that national groups could help encourage local communities to adopt principles that simultaneously protected the environment and helped save developer's money. Many communities cannot currently practice these better site design principles because the existing local codes, ordinances and review processes often prohibit their utilization. The overall objective of Builders for the Bay is to mitigate the environmental impacts of development by increasing stakeholder involvement in the process of local codes development and encouraging developers to utilize the flexibility inherent in better site design. The short-term goal is to form alliances that will engage local environmental groups, governments and developers of a community in a process to assess their current codes and ordinances. Long term, it is hoped that the facilitated process to change local codes and ordinances within these communities will have a long-lasting effect on how developments are regulated at the local level.

History   Catholic antecedents  The Lusitanian Catholic Orthodox Church identifies its origins in the original undivided Christian community founded by Jesus, with its traditions first established by the Twelve Apostles. Christianity came to Portugal with Saint Peter of Braga, a disciple of Saint James the Great, who sent him between 45 and 60 AD. The legend says that Saint James, one of the apostles of Christ, visited the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula in 44 AD. One of his supposed visits was to Serra de Rates, in the current municipality of P√≥voa de Varzim. During his visit, the apostle is to have ordained the local Peter of Rates as the first bishop Braga. It is believed that Saint Peter of Rates was beheaded while converting believers of the Roman religion to the Christian faith. The first historically recorded bishop of Braga was Paterno, who took part in the Council of Toledo in the year 400. The Metropolitan of Braga had canonical precedence over the diocese of Con√≠mbriga, diocese of Viseu, diocese of Dume, diocese of Lamego, diocese of Porto and diocese of Egit√¢nia (at present Idanha-a-Velha). The South of Portugal was under the Bishop of Evora and Lisbon. In the year 1052, the Bishop of Rome, claiming authority over all West, and adding the \\"Filioque\\" in the Nicene Creed, leading many (generally Orthodox) churches to leave communion with Rome. In some places in the West, such as in Southern Italy, many bishops resisted.  Schism  In the 19th century many priests dissented from the Roman Catholic Church in Portugal. Some of them joined the Lusitanian Catholic Apostolic Evangelical Church, others remained independent Catholics, celebrating mass underground. In the 1980s some of these priests received episcopal ordination through Rapoza's line and the Old Calendarist Greek Orthodox Church and rebuilt Orthodox Catholicism in Portugal.  Doctrine  The Lusitanian Orthodox Church accepts the seven ecumenical councils. The Lusitanian Orthodox Church keeps the original Nicene Creed, accepted universally by the Church, East and West, during the first millennium without the addition of Filioque. The Holy Communion is celebrated with both wine and bread, with the anamnesis, the Words of Institution and the Epiclesis of the Holy Spirit is a \\"consecrating formula\\". The Lusitanian Orthodox Church believes the Original Sin has consequences in death, concupiscence and tendency toward sin in human nature, but not inheriting guilty for Adam's faults. The Lusitanian Orthodox Church has always believed that the Mother of God (Theotokos) is the highest person above all humanity and the angels owing to her role as Mother of the Word Incarnate. But does not believe in her Immaculate Conception nor Assumption into Heaven. The Lusitanian Orthodox Church believes the Holy Spirit act in the humanity (Theosis) through the Incarnation, Death and Resurrection of our Lord, God and Saviour Jesus Christ wo sends the Comforter. The Lusitanian Orthodox Church rejects the idea of a purgatory.  Hierarchy  The Lusitanian Orthodox Church is headed by the Orthodox Archbishop of Braga and Lisbon, who is also Metropolitan Primate of Portugal, Spain and All Brazil.Lusitanian Orthodox Church Dioceses The first titular has been Jo√£o I, since his election at the I Local Council of the Lusitanian Orthodox Church, at 8 June 1997, by acclamation, and his enthronement, at 15 June 1997. He is aided by the (auxiliary) titular bishops of Con√≠mbriga, Viseu, Dume, Lamego, Evora and Egit√¢nia. The Portuguese territory is divided in three eparchies (dioceses) : * the Metropolitan's proper Archeparchy of Braga, which besides spiritual oversee of the whole church take care of expatriate parishes and missions in London (UK), Brussels (Benelux), Lille, Paris (France), Geneve (Switzerland), Cambridge, Mass. (USA), S√£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Mississauga (Brazil), Canada and Cape Town (South Africa) * the Eparchy of Lisbon, covering the south of Portugal and overseas islands : Azores and Madeira * the Eparchy of Porto, serving the North of Portugal and Galicia. The presbyters and deacons may marry before ordination. There is one order of monastic life, called Order of Saint Basil (like the main Orthodox order), with eight monks and five nuns. There are about 2,000 members and sympathizers, mostly in Northern Portugal.  Liturgy  It follows the ancient Braga Rite celebrated in Portuguese, with churches having iconostasis, facing East, the icons are painted rather than sculpted. As in the Orthodox Liturgy, the bread of the Eucharist is leavened, and every member receives part of the wine and the bread. Children are baptized by immersion. It follows the Julian calendar of the Liturgic Year, like the Orthodox.

From the 1940s she worked as a stage comedian, performing monologues and songs accompanied by her pianist brother, George \\"Geunie\\" Griner, who died in 1975. Her most notable recording, in 1954, was \\"Callin' Moody Field,\\" which described the lives of African-American airmen at Moody Air Force Base near Valdosta, Georgia. \\"Callin' Moody Field\\" was a regional rhythm and blues hit (Groove 0009). In the performance, Miss Peaches is talking to the base telephone operator and trying to reach her boyfriend: \\"You doesn't know Cathead. Well, honey, just stick yo head out the window and holler for Cathead. He'll come.\\" From 1961 to 1966, she and Geunie published The Nashville Herald, a weekly newspaper in her hometown of Nashville, Georgia. She twice won the Georgia Press Association's premier recognition for her weekly column, The Focus On:. She and Geunie later turned to political comedy, releasing an LP of political satire called The Focus on: The South, Where the REaction Is!, on Judges' Chamber records (1966). Also on the Judges' Chamber label, probably in 1975, was the Safari Down South LP that showed her riding a llama on the cover. She and Geunie also recorded their family gospel group, the Holy Notes. She was married in 1952 to USAF Major Hugh D. Alderman, who died in 1973. In 1985, she changed her given name to Annabel. In 1999, Mercer University Press published her first novel, Family Man.

Biography Jean Yarbrough was born in Marianna, Arkansas on August 22, 1901. He attended the University of the South located in Sewanee, Tennessee. In 1922, Yarbrough entered the film business working in silent pictures, first as a prop-man and later rising through the ranks to become an assistant director. By 1936, he was a bona fide director, first doing comedy and musical shorts for RKO which was founded by Joseph P. Kennedy among others. His directorial debut for a feature-length film was Rebellious Daughters which was made by the low-budget studio, Progressive Pictures in 1938. His greatest success came in the 1940s and 1950s, when he directed comedy teams like Abbott and Costello (five films: Here Come the Co-Eds, In Society, Jack and the Beanstalk, Lost in Alaska, and The Naughty Nineties), The Bowery Boys (five films: Angels in Disguise, Master Minds, Triple Trouble, Crashing Las Vegas, and Hot Shots) and horror/cult movies that are still fondly remembered to this day, such as The Devil Bat, King of the Zombies, She-Wolf of London, and House of Horrors. Yarbrough found little difficulty in transitioning from the traditional B-movies which were on the decline, to the new medium of television. He directed many episodes for different TV series throughout the 1950s and 1960s which are widely considered to be the Golden Age of Television. In addition to directing, he had a two-year stint working as both producer and director of the very popular Abbott and Costello Show. He directed some episodes of The Silent Service and Navy Log, also during the 1950s, which were military dramas based on true stories of the United States Navy. He subsequently directed episodes of Walter Brennan's western series The Guns of Will Sonnett. His last theatrical film was 1967's Hillbillys in a Haunted House, a mixture of comedy, horror and country music, starring Basil Rathbone and Lon Chaney, Jr. Partial filmography * The Devil Bat (1940) * King of the Zombies (1941) * The Gang's All Here (1941) * Father Steps Out (1941) * Let's Go Collegiate (1940) * Good Morning, Judge (1943) * In Society (1944) * Moon Over Las Vegas (1944) * Here Come The Co-Eds (1945) * The Naughty Nineties (1945) * House of Horrors (1946) * Inside Job (1946) * She- Wolf of London (1946) * Cuban Pete (1946) * The Brute Man (1946) * Shed No Tears (1948) * The Creeper (1948) * The Challenge (1948) * Holiday in Havana (1949) * Sideshow (1950) * Jack and the Beanstalk (1952) * Lost in Alaska (1952) * Crashing Las Vegas (1956) * The Women of Pitcairn Island (1956) * Footsteps in the Night (1957) * Saintly Sinners (1962) * Hillbillys in a Haunted House (1967) * The Over-the-Hill Gang (1969) TV-movie References External links *Jean Yarbrough biography, Search my Trash.com; accessed March 17, 2014. * 1900 births 1975 deaths English- language film directors People from Marianna, Arkansas Sewanee: The University of the South alumni Place of death missing Film directors from Arkansas ","title":"Jean Yarbrough"},{"id":"6414634","text":"Sean Reynolds is a fictional character from the British ITV soap opera Emmerdale, played by Stephen McGann. He made his first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 10 March 1999. Casting McGann joined the cast of Emmerdale as Sean, the patriarch of the Reynolds family, in February 1999. The role of Sean marked McGann's return to television following an absence of several years. The actor revealed he had some initial reservations about joining Emmerdale, but as soon as he arrived on set they did not last long. McGann said \\"Within minutes of arriving I felt I knew what I was doing here and I was enjoying it. There's good and bad in every genre, whether it's films, television or theatre, but I have to say I think I've picked a good soap.\\" In November 2001, McGann announced he was quitting his role as Sean. The actor made his final screen appearance as Sean on 4 January 2002. Shortly after McGann departed Emmerdale, producers axed his character's family, saying they could not develop them any further. Development Sean was introduced as a haulage boss and \\"disgruntled rival\\" of Chris Tate (Peter Amory).Parkin 2002, p.111. He becomes determined to put Chris out of business and McGann commented \\"The town ain't big enough for the both of them. Sean is a ruthless and sly operator. He's going to employ all sorts of underhand tactics to get what he wants. This feud is going to run and run.\\" Sean and his family later moved into the village and his wife Angie (Freya Copeland) suggested he and Chris become partners in Tate Haulage. A writer for the Finnish television station, MTV3 described Sean as \\"a decent family man and hard-working employee.\\" Inside Soap's Steven Murphy described Sean as \\"hard-nosed\\". McGann admitted he loved playing \\"the edginess\\" of his character, saying \\"If you are playing some doe-eyed hero it's cool but it's more fun to play baddies.\\" Storylines Sean Reynolds first arrived in Emmerdale on 10 March 1999 along with his wife Angie, and two children Marc and Ollie. Sean settled down with his family in Emmerdale, and set up his own haulage firm. However, he found himself in stiff competition with rival businessman Chris Tate, who, like Sean, owned a successful haulage firm. Sean's stubbornness not to let Chris gain the upper-hand often got in the way of his own business, and there were several confrontations between Sean and Chris. At one point, Angie suggested that Sean become business partners with Chris, but Sean abruptly brushed this idea off. Sean's establishment as an unattentive husband and unfit father made him notorious in Emmerdale as a potential misery, and he became very unpopular with his fellow residents. In February 2001, Sean's father Len joined him in Emmerdale following the sudden death of Sean's mother and Len's wife Eileen. During this time, Sean embarked on an extramarital sexual affair with local businesswoman Tara Thornfield. Tara had seduced Sean after the pair both discovered that they had developed romantic feelings for each other, and hs subsequently been unable to resist temptation. Tara had previously had a passionate affair with another married man, Biff Fowler. Sean and Tara's affair was exposed in 2001, but Sean's wife Angie handled it well. Nevertheless, Sean and Tara decided not to start a life together, as they both felt that it would be a betrayal for Sean's children. However, they seemed to change their minds, and on 4 January 2002, they gave into temptation once again, and drove off into the sunset to start a new life in Chester where Sean had got a new job. Reception In August 2002, McGann was nominated for an Echo Entertainment Award for his portrayal of Sean. Billy Sloan of the Sunday Mail said McGann's character \\"achieved notoriety when he had a steamy, marriage-wrecking affair with upper-crust Lady Tara Thornfield\\". The Daily Mirror's Sally Morgan branded Sean a \\"love-cheat husband with a selfish streak who cared little for his own kids.\\" While Tim Randall of the Daily Record called him a \\"love rat\\".

The company was acquired by General Dynamics in 2011. Company The company traces its roots to Sonic Jet Performance, Inc., a California speed boat company founded in 1997. When the boat business hit tough times after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, a new investor Frank Kavanaugh stepped in and looked to alter the direction of the business. Kavanaugh financed and secured the rights to a new line of products in support of the company's Mission to Protect and Save Lives. Around that time, the team identified an insolvent company in South Carolina called Technical Solutions, building a prototype of a mine-resistant vehicle called Buffalo and attempting to build a smaller vehicle called the Cougar/Tempest MRAP (Mine Resistant Ambush Protected). Technical Solutions was struggling and required a new strategy and additional resources. The products were designed using commercial components, and utilized a strategy to allow them to be rapidly rebuilt in the field. Kavanaugh, the company chairman and largest investor, rebranded the company Force Protection, added rapid design capability, a focus on product quality, large scale production, and technical talent including the addition Dr. Vernon Joynt an internationally recognized blast expert. Over a 3-year period, the new management team retooled the vehicles and developed the production capability of the business to almost $1.3 billion in annual sales - by integrating high quality US automotive components with an innovative and effective blast resistant chassis. The heavily armored trucks featured a V-hull design that deflected underbody blasts away from the passenger compartment, and with Dr. Joynt's expertise the products were enhanced to address side-blast from IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices) that had become a primary cause of injury and death for soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. The base designs secured from Mechem (South African government) resulted in two U.S. models: the Buffalo, a huge, mine-clearing truck, and the Cougar, which was smaller and more versatile, and through the company's R & D efforts with Dr. Joynt several innovations and improvements such as the Cheetah, and Spaced Armor. Force Protection initially struggled with its first small MRAP contracts in 2002 through 2005. At first the company had less than a dozen people on its early production line. At times the prototype approach took five weeks to build one Cougar. The United States Department of Defense fined Force Protection more than $1.5 million for initial delivery delays. Kavanaugh focused on moving from a prototype production environment to sustainable volume production methods. The team overcame these issues, developed agreements with other defense industry manufacturers such as Armor Holdings and BAE Systems, as well as a joint venture company with General Dynamics (\\"Force Dynamics\\"), to merge Force Protection's proprietary designs with the manufacturing capacity necessary to meet increasing demand. Force Protection received several contracts as part of the MRAP program, supplying blast resistant vehicles to American forces in Iraq, but with Kavanaugh‚Äôs departure in 2007 the remaining team lost focus and chose not to introduce an innovative JLTV category vehicle known as Cheetah. This led ultimately to the sale of the Company to General Dynamics as orders were increasingly placed with rivals companies.More MRAPs: Navistar‚Äôs MaxxPro Maintains the Pole Position - Defense Industry Daily Product Line *Cheetah ‚Äì Thirteen Cheetah prototypes were produced in 2005 and available in 2006 & 2007\\\\.

Fear arrived at Plymouth, Massachusetts on July 10, 1623 aboard the Anne. Fear died sometime before December 12, 1634. His father had been married first to Mary Norris who died on February 25, 1621. He had 3 half-siblings: Bartholomew, Remember and Mary, the last surviving passenger of the Mayflower. After Fear's death, he moved to the New Haven Colony, and by 1644 had remarried to his third wife, Joanna Swinnerton. Because of the general ire of the Plymouth Colony against his father, he had moved to the New Haven Colony. As a result of the upheavals of losing his mother and his father moving away, the young Allerton became a member of the extended family of his grandfather William Brewster and eventually joined the family of his uncle Love Brewster. His aunt Sarah Allerton was married to Degory Priest who was a signer of the Mayflower Compact, and one of the original 102 Pilgrims who arrived on the Mayflower to Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1620.

As a tobacco planter-merchant Allerton probably constructed a wharf and warehouse (as his father had done in New Amsterdam) since financial success required both growing and transporting tobacco. Whether Allerton bought land from his neighbor Richard Lee II or acquired it over time is not known. He may have acquired the land from his marriage to Elizabeth, who would have acquired it from her previous marriages or from her parents. In any event, Allerton's family became wealthy, with indentured servants, and owned a plantation on the south side of the Rappahannock River.

Twinlab is based in Boca Raton, Florida. Twinlab currently produces more than 500 different products.Mission Statement, twinlab.com, accessed January 13, 2007. History Twinlab was founded by David and Jean Blechman in 1968 and run by them and their sons ‚Äì Neil, Brian, Ross, Steve and Dean. Using experience gained from over 20 years as a pharmaceutical salesman, David Blechman named the company for his two sets of twins and started marketing a liquid protein supplement from their family garage. Sales of Twinlab's only product skyrocketed in the 1970s, in part from the success of a 1976 book entitled The Last Chance Diet ‚Äî When Everything Else Has Failed: Dr. Linn's Protein-Sparing Fast Program. Dr. Robert Linn was a Pennsylvania osteopath, who had begun prescribing for his overweight patients a program of fasting and four- to six- ounce daily doses of liquid protein. His book sold extremely well, and Dr. Linn's diet became the latest weight-loss fad diet. This led to increased sales for Twinlab's liquid protein. As with many fad diets, the fasting/liquid protein craze came to a halt when in late 1976 and early 1977 there were reports of the deaths of 58 people who had followed Linn's diet. Following a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigation the associated coverage of the popular diet and its potential side effects by Newsweek, Parents' Magazine, and Science Digest, the liquid protein market bottomed out, and Twinlab's revenues declined sharply forcing the company to cut nearly all of its 150-person workforce. In the 1980s Twinlab branched out formulating new vitamin and nutritional supplements and purchased a publishing company called Advanced Research Press, Inc. (ARP) publishers of the bodybuilding magazine Muscular Development and several other magazines. David Blechman retired in 1996, and passed the title of CEO to his son Ross, while the other sons were installed as corporate officers. He died on July 7, 2000.

He remains the youngest mayor in the city's history. He is also one of the youngest mayors of a major United States city and the second of the Roman Catholic mayors of New York City. Biography Hugh Grant, whose father John Grant had grown rich in politics and real estate, was born on West 27th Street in New York City,Hamersly, p. 165. on September 10, 1858. He was orphaned young and raised by his guardian, a man named McAleer. He attended both public and private schools, spent two years at Manhattan College, another year studying in Germany, and two more at Columbia Law School.Who Was Who in America, IV, 1968. Though the earliest data, including the United States census of 1860 and 1870 and Grant's 1878 passport application, establish his birth year as 1858, early in his political career he began to present himself as born several years earlier in 1852 or 1853, perhaps to avoid calling attention to his youth. A Tammany Hall Democrat, he began his political career as a city alderman from 1883‚Äì1884, where he was one of only two aldermen not caught up in a financial scandal related to the Broadway Surface Railroad. For the remainder of his public career, however, he was a compliant member of Tammany under the patronage and control of its leader Richard Croker.Connable and Silberfard, p. 204ff. Grant lost the race for mayor as Tammany's candidate in 1885, but won the office of sheriff in 1886. He was Sheriff of New York County from 1887 to 1888. He was Mayor of New York City from 1889 to 1892, appointing Croker as New York City Chamberlain in 1889. His administrative accomplishments included the reorganization of city administration and the initial stages of placing the city's electrical system underground. He declined to run again at the end of his second term, but ran once more in 1894 and lost.Doyle News: \\"The Collection of Hugh J. Grant and Lucie Mackey Grant\\" The details of Croker's and Tammany's bribes and involvement in criminal activity came to light through the work of the Fassett Investigation of 1890. Grant's role included $25,000 in cash given to Croker's daughter Flossie‚Äîsupposedly gifts he made as god-father to the little girl.Allen, pp. 179-180; Werner, p. 320-323; Connable and Silberfarb, p. 209. A grand jury described Grant's tenure as Sheriff as \\"tainted and corrupt\\".Werner, p. 323. In February 1892, crusading reformist Rev. Charles Parkhurst of the Madison Square Presbyterian Church denounced his administration: \\"every step that we take looking to the moral betterment of this city has to be taken directly into the teeth of the damnable pack of administrative blood-hounds that are fattening themselves on the ethical flesh and blood of our citizenship.\\" He called Grant and his political colleagues \\"a lying, perjured, rum-soaked, and libidinous lot\\" of \\"polluted harpies.\\"Peter Hartshorn, I Have Seen the Future: A Life of Lincoln Steffens (Counterpoint, 2011), p. 42. Grant's business interests ranged from serving as receiver of the St. Nicholas Bank to promoting the development of the Harlem River Speedway, later to become the Harlem River Drive, a track for horse racing, in association with Nathan Straus.Hamersly, p. 166. Straus named one of his sons Hugh Grant Straus.Straus Historical Society: Strauss Family Newsletter, \\"Nathan Straus, 1848-1931,\\" v. 6 no. 2 (August, 1998), 5 , accessed April 6, 2010. A resident of Oradell, New Jersey who spent most of his time at his home there, Grant died of a sudden heart attack or stroke at his home on East 72nd Street on November 3, 1910. After a funeral at the church of St. Ignatius Loyola on Park Avenue and 84th Street, he was buried in Calvary Cemetery. Marriage On April 30, 1895, Grant wed Julia M. Murphy, the daughter of U.S. Senator Edward Murphy. She had been born on March 11, 1873, the oldest of the Senator's eleven children. When her father went to Washington, D.C., to serve in the U.S. Senate, she accompanied him and acted as his hostess. Cardinal James Gibbons of Baltimore granted special dispensation for the wedding celebration to be held at the Murphy home at the corner of K and 17th Streets in Washington, D.C., rather than in a church. Archbishop Michael Corrigan of New York officiated, assisted by several priests. Senator Murphy was a political ally of and financial adviser to Richard Croker.Stoddard, pp. 72, 127, 149, and 201-202. After traveling for several months in Europe, the Grants lived and raised three children in their 20-room townhouse at 20 East 72nd Street in New York City.Andreassi, pp. 25-26. In 1914, Julia Grant provided a financial bequest, originally anonymous, that provided the funds for establishing Regis High School, a Jesuit high school in New York City that, following her instructions, provides a free education for Catholic boys with special consideration given to those who cannot afford a Catholic education.Andreassi, 26ff. She did not remarry after her husband's death in 1910 and died at home in May 1944.Andreassi, pp. 94-96. She was buried alongside her husband in the family mausoleum. Her estate, based entirely on a trust established by her husband, was valued in 1944 at more than $13 million. In 1948, Auxiliary Bishop Stephen J. Donahue dedicated the chapel of Archbishop Stepinac High School as a memorial to her. Her heirs donated the Grants' home in New York City, a five-story, townhouse on Manhattan's Upper East Side in which the family had its own chapel, to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York. It then became the residence of the Vatican's Permanent Observer to the United Nations and the temporary residence of popes who have visited the city.Andreassi, pp. 124-125. Legacy The Grants had three children, Julia M. Grant (1896-1962), Edna M. Grant (1898-1968), and Major Hugh John Grant, Jr., (1904-1981). Hugh Grant is memorialized in the Hugh J.

The characters all have Spanish codenames. They are a team of supervillains opposed to the X-Men. Their motives to attack both humans and mutants were not exactly clear to begin with, though it was known they held a grudge against Sabretooth. Their motive is that they believe themselves to be the rightful species to inherit the planet, but must first wipe out everyone else. They are not mutants, but beings evolved from a baseline human genome over a time period of 6,000 years. Their society was raised in the hold of a ship where temporal acceleration technology was used to evolve individuals into superpowered beings, in a fashion similar to the creations of the Weapon Plus Program. Due to genetic drift, they are a separate species from either baseline humans or mutant humans. Fictional team biography Supernovas Five superpowered beings who aimed to destroy both mutants and baseline humans surfaced and hunted for Sabretooth. In their attempts, they casually destroyed a town in Nogales, Mexico, and manipulated survivors and the media into thinking that the X-Men were involved. Creed was ambushed by Aguja and Fuego, unfortunately attacked too recklessly, allowing for Sabretooth to escape. He reaches the X-Men. The Children of the Vault killed all of the members of the S.H.I.E.L.D. facility where Northstar was captive and took him, and later Aurora, in order to kill Sabretooth. Images of the X-Men were doctored into the security footage by Serafina, allowing for a similar attempt to discredit the team. They also enhanced the powers of the twins so that they now produce a powerful heat blast when touching. They spoke of an incoming force of destruction that will allow only one race to survive. Considering they considered both humans and mutants as opposition to their own survival, the Children were unlikely to be mutants. After sending an enhanced Northstar and Aurora to kill Sabretooth and the X-Men, Serafina and Perro watched from the distance. The surprise attack was initially successful, seeing the apparent death of Iceman and severe injuries to many of the X-Men. Luckily, Aurora was defeated thanks to Mystique's manipulation and Iceman's surprise (though incomplete) reformation, and Northstar was defeated by the combined efforts of Rogue and Cable. In interrogations after the fight, Cable learned through Sabretooth that their enemies were known as \\"The Children of the Vault\\", were neither mutant nor human, and wanted him dead simply for learning of their existence. Sabretooth took a certain amount of pleasure in this revelation, as it now put the X-Men \\"on the endangered species list\\" along with himself. Meanwhile, Serafina used her cloaking abilities to infiltrate the mansion directly. She was invisible to telepaths, and Wolverine was only mildly aware of something amiss. She easily made her way to the injured Lady Mastermind in the infirmary, and hijacked her abilities to trap Cannonball in an illusion. Wolverine, however, realised that they were there, and managed to free Cannonball, only to have both of them taken out by Serafina. She easily disposed of Wolverine by turning his adamantium skeleton against him, poisoning him. She then defeated Cannonball and left to return with her teammates. She reported back to the Conquistador, which the Children were still using as their base, but had been refitted so that it could fly, and it headed straight for New York. Rogue and her team, now including Lady Mastermind, Sabretooth, and Omega Sentinel, managed to track the whereabouts of the ship, and decided to take the fight to the Children. However, they soon found out that the Children were not like anything they faced before, and were easily subdued, with Iceman being essentially vaporized by Fuego, as the Conquistador hovered over the Xavier Institute, ready to destroy all the mutants housed within. However, even chained up, the X-Men were able to fight back, destroying the weapons that would have destroyed the school, and killing several of the Children, including Sangre, Aguja (Lady Mastermind projected an illusion making Aguja look like her and Fuego incinerated her) and Fuego (was killed when Iceman pulled himself back together and completely froze his enemy solid). With his last breaths, Sangre (who was mortally wounded by Mystique, who shot him with thermite bullets), tried to put Conquistador into the school, but it was stopped at the last minute by Cannonball and the ONE Sentinels. Many of the Children did manage to escape the battle alive, such as Perro, leaving behind some three thousand animal carcasses changed to resemble them, so that the X-Men had believed they were destroyed in an explosion on the ship. They then escaped to Ecuador, to hole up in the abandoned Sentinel facility once used by Cassandra Nova, and are most recently led by the mysterious Cadena.Marvel.com Blogs - Spy in the House by Agent M The X-Men would continue to use the captured Conquistador as a flying base of operations for some time. Cable later wrecked it, on Providence, in a failed attempt to destroy Hecatomb by causing a meltdown of its internal fusion reactor. Collision When Rogue and Magneto bring Indra and other students back to Indra's home in Mumbai to visit his family and, unbeknownst to anyone at the time, take his brother's place in an arranged marriage, the X-Men and students visit a local market where strange storms have been placing people, including Indra's brother, in comas. During one such storm, the mutants come across a young girl who tells them her name is Luisa and that she's a new mutant with the ability to paint with light. They don't have time to question her before Sentinels arrive to capture her.X-Men: Legacy #238 Anole and Loa manage to finish the Sentinels off, and the X-Men take Luisa back to Indra's family home, where the unruly girl infuriates Indra's father by creating a light painting of her and Indra in a nude embrace and kissing Indra in his room. Magneto is suspicious of Luisa from the beginning and questions her about who she really is, managing to get her to confess that she's not a mutant and she's from somewhere called Quitado. In truth, her name is Luz, and she is from somewhere called the Corridor, a high-tech floating city where she was a student meant to be a part of something called Angelfire. However, she rebelled against her leader, a woman named Corregidora, who had Luz jailed. Luz escaped the Corridor through something called a membrane, ending up in Mumbai during the recent storm. Rogue and Magneto finally go to confront her for answers, but they are interrupted by her people, the Children of the Vault, including Serafina, Cadena, and Perro, all very much alive.X-Men: Legacy #239 Dawn of X The Children of the Vault have since reappeared after the introduction of Krakoa as a mutant nation and one of them, Serafina, even was rescued from captivity by the X-Men, when they raid on an Orchis Hub.X-Men (Vol. 5) #1 How long was she an inmate of Orchis is unknown, what its known is that she was being studied by the organization. Later, Darwin, Synch and X-23 are tasked with infiltrating the Children's base of operations in Equador, because they have the best chance of surviving what they assume will be an extremely volatile mission since inside the Master Mold's vault time moves differently than outside. Members The Children of the Vault members are: Sangre (Blood): The de facto team leader, he has grey skin that is apparently made of liquid and, thanks to his advanced water manipulation abilities, can produce bubbles used to suffocate his victims, among other things. He has an aquatic body which is not easily harmed. During the fight at the Xavier Institute, Mystique shot Sangre with thermite bullets, which evaporated the water in his body when they exploded, killing him. Perro (Dog): He possesses superhuman strength, durability and control over gravity. A massive, battle-hungry man, Perro is the muscle of the Children of the Vault and is always searching for a fight. Despite being the typical \\"brick\\" of the team, Perro is quite intelligent and expresses himself very well.Mike Carey, Chris Bachalo, X-Men vol. 2 #189 (Oct. 2006) Serafina (Seraph): A technopath, she is able to mechanically interface with machinery and other people. With her powers, she can enhance and control their powers. Her human senses are masterfully enhanced as well. She can differentiate between psionic illusions and reality on sight. Serafina is also able to detect genetic and bio-chemical data down to the molecular level. This makes her an extraordinary tracker, capable not only of tracing a target's path but also identifying any person or object they might have touched and recognizing subtle shifts in their body chemistry or metabolism, such as changes in adrenaline levels or pulse rate. She can also manipulate bio- molecular ingredients to some degree. Aguja (Needle): She possesses powers that include the projection of energy blasts and force fields. During the battle against the X-Men, Lady Mastermind projected an illusion to make Aguja look like her, causing Fuego to mistakenly kill Aguja. Fuego (Fire): Has the appearance of a flaming skeleton. He possesses magma powers that are fueled by the energy he gets from his surroundings.Mike Carey, Chris Bachalo, X-Men vol. 2 #188 (Sept. 2006) He has been killed by Iceman. Cadena (Chain): The new leader of the Children after Sangre's apparent demise, she has a globe of electricity surrounding her head that she can manipulate into electrical chains.Mike Carey, Chris Bachalo, X-Men vol. 2 #193 (Feb. 2007) Luz (Light): She has the ability to bend and manipulate light, \\"painting\\" or shaping it into anything she wishes. Can manipulate light and project holograms of current events happening elsewhere. Corregidora (Mayor): Can implant suggestions into the minds of others with verbal spells. She operates the House of Corrections. Her weapon is a knife. She apparently holds a grudge against the X-Men from their last encounter. Martillo (Hammer): Superhuman strength and resistance; uses a large hammer in battle. Olvido (Oblivion): Able to take anything directed at him into what he calls \\"the void\\" and direct it back at his opponents in his own form of energy.

It was founded in 2006 by Goran Simic, a well-known writer of poetry, essays, short stories and theatre. His associates include business partner Vishja Brcic, editor Fraser Sutherland, and designer Shaun Tai. Luna Publications' books address the cultural and intellectual attrition of the mainstream information flow, and work to compensate for the homogenization and commercialization of our literary experience. Its fiction attempts to be culturally conscious, fearless, edgy, and recognizable while its non-fiction strives to be iconoclastic and to give voice to some of the political complexities of our era. Simiƒá says of Luna: > I believe that big publishers are dinosaurs with no sense of what‚Äôs going on > in the Canadian literary scene. That creates opportunity for small presses. > There is huge hyper-production of books by mediocre authors who have no idea > what writing is all about.

History The Council of Trent (Sess. XXIII, chap. xvi on Reform) lays down the rule that \\"no cleric who is a stranger shall without letter commendatory from his own ordinary be admitted by any bishop to celebrate the divine mysteries\\". Ordinarily permission is not to be given to a priest from another diocese to say Mass without this certificate signed and duly sealed. The seal is obviously the more important requisite, as it is the safer guarantee against forgery. The celebret should be officially recognized by the diocesan authority of the place where a priest may wish to say Mass. One who has his celebret in due form, or who is certainly known to be in good standing in his own diocese, may be allowed to celebrate until he has had a sufficient time to comply with this rule. A priest with proper credentials cannot reasonably be prevented from saying Mass, though he will be expected to comply with reasonable restrictions which may be imposed. In the U.S, the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore, as a regulation against collectors of funds for other dioceses or countries, enacted a decree (No. 295) that priests on such a mission should not be allowed to celebrate Mass even a single time until they had received permission from the ordinary. This rule has generally been enforced in diocesan synods. The absence of the celebret does not suffice for the refusal of permission to say Mass, if persons worthy of belief bear positive testimony to the good standing of the priest. If the permission is unreasonably refused, the priest may say Mass privately, if no scandal is given. Yet the rectors of churches are not obliged to incur any expenses the celebration may involve.

Before coaching, Holcomb was a starting halfback at Ohio State University and the captain of the 1931 Buckeyes football team. Prior to arriving at Miami, Holcomb was the head football coach at three smaller schools: the University of Findlay (1932‚Äì1935), Muskingum College (1936‚Äì1940), and Washington & Jefferson College (1941). He also served as the head basketball coach at University of Findlay for four seasons, 1932‚Äì33 through 1935‚Äì36 and at the United States Military Academy from 1945 to 1947. After retiring from coaching, Holcomb was the athletic director at Northwestern University (1956‚Äì1966) and later the general manager of Major League Baseball's Chicago White Sox (1971‚Äì1973). Coaching career Miami Holcomb was named Miami University's head football coach for the 1942 season succeeding Frank Wilton. His first team went 3‚Äì6 which equaled the number of wins of the three previous years for the Redskins. The next year Holcomb and the Redskins posted a winning record of 7‚Äì2‚Äì1. This team was dominated by defense, only allowing their opponents to score in double digits twice; A 34‚Äì12 win over Bradley University and a 35‚Äì0 blow out loss to Arkansas A&M.; In his two years as Miami‚Äôs head coach he compiled an overall record of 10‚Äì9‚Äì1. He left Miami to become an assistant coach for Earl Blaik at the United States Military Academy. He was replaced as Redskins coach by future Pro and College Football Hall of Fame coach Sid Gillman who was one of Holcomb's top assistant coaches. Army While an assistant football coach for the United States Military Academy, Holcomb was head coach of the men‚Äôs basketball team for two seasons from 1945 through 1947. He led the cadets to two straight winning seasons of 9‚Äì6 and 9‚Äì7. Purdue During Holcomb‚Äôs tenure as Boilermakers head coach he compiled a record of 35‚Äì42‚Äì4. His best year was 1952 when he led the Boilermakers to a Big Ten Conference co-championship and a #18 ranking in the final poll. Despite having only a 4‚Äì3‚Äì2 overall record, Holcomb's team played well in conference with a 4‚Äì1‚Äì1 record. Holcomb‚Äôs Purdue teams are, perhaps, best remembered for ending Notre Dame's 39-game unbeaten streak when his Boilermakers defeated the Irish, 28‚Äì14, in the second game of the 1950 season. Holcomb was known for developing solid quarterbacks including Bob DeMoss, Dale Samuels and Len Dawson. These players helped grow a strong tradition at Purdue of great quarterback play. On December 12, 1955, after his nine seasons at Purdue, Holcomb left Purdue to accept the athletic director position at the Northwestern University Sports administrator Holcomb served as the Athletic Director at Northwestern from 1956-1966.

He played mostly in the minors, but also made it to the majors with the Chicago White Sox and New York Mets from 1990 to 1992. Early life and career Born in Detroit, McCray's family moved west while he was still a child. He enrolled at University High in Los Angeles, then attended West Los Angeles Junior College and Santa Monica Junior College. The speedy outfielder was drafted in the first round by the Chicago White Sox in 1982 and then by the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1983, but opted to stay in school. Finally, he signed with the San Diego Padres in 1984. After four years in the Padres chain, the White Sox claimed him in the 1987 minor league draft. Never much of a hitter (his career minor league batting average was just .226), McCray proved effective by drawing walks (enough to pump his career on-base percentage up to .362), stealing bases (as many as 91 in one season, with Charleston in 1986.) The Crash After finally making the majors with the White Sox in 1990, McCray was sent back down to the AAA Vancouver Canadians of the Pacific Coast League the following year. On May 27, 1991, at Civic Stadium (now Providence Park) in Portland, Oregon, McCray chased after a fly ball hit by Portland's Chip Hale. McCray initially made the catch, but immediately turned to run right through a plywood fence in right field, just to the right of the 369-foot marker, which caused him to drop the ball. The incident was somewhat similar to a scene in The Natural, in which outfielder \\"Bump Bailey\\" of the \\"New York Knights\\" crashes through a wall. McCray was not seriously hurt (in contrast to the fictional Bailey, who died from his injuries), but became an instant celebrity as the play was shown repeatedly on newscasts across the country; a video clip of the play is now part of a blooper reel looped at the Baseball Hall of Fame. McCray made it back up to the White Sox later that year, but was used almost exclusively as a pinch runner and backup outfielder. After signing with the New York Mets in 1992, McCray was again relegated to pinch running until May 8 against the Dodgers in Shea Stadium, when he pinch-ran for Eddie Murray, stayed in the game as the right fielder and then batted in the ninth with two men on and the score tied at 3-3. Off reliever Tim Crews, McCray delivered a game-winning single in what was to be his only major league at-bat of 1992 (and the final one of his career). After appearing in two more games as a pinch runner, the Mets released McCray on June 8; after batting .242 in 61 games for the independent Thunder Bay Whiskey Jacks of the Northern League in 1993, he retired as a player. McCray played in 67 major league games but logged just fourteen at-bats (with three hits), while stealing nine bases in ten attempts. Later life Rodney later served as a coach in the minor-leagues for the Lethbridge Mounties in 1994 and Lansing Lugnuts in 1998, and later a minor league base running and outfield instructor in the Los Angeles Dodgers organization. On August 12, 2006, McCray was honored in Portland with the \\"Rodney McCray Bobblehead Night\\", honoring his memorable crash through the wall. McCray threw out the first pitch, and right-center field of PGE Park was renamed \\"McCray Alley\\" in his honor. \\"I just wish I had run through something like a Coca-Cola sign so I could have gotten endorsements,\\" McCray said. \\"Instead, I ran through a local sign, \`Flav-R-Pac meats.'\\" He is currently an assistant coach for Calvin Meadlock for the C2 teams in Houston, Texas. ESPN, in its series Who's Number 1?, ranked the fence incident as the seventh- favourite sports blooper of all time. The Best Damn Sports Show Period ranked the incident number one in their countdown of the Top 50 Devastating Hits in sports history. On June 4, 2019, McCray's son Grant was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the third round of the 2019 MLB Rule 4 Draft.

The artist is classified as a Minimalist as demonstrated in his works, which were mostly defined through the materials used, without allusions to subjects outside of the works. He lives and works in New York City. He is married to the artist Ellen Phelan. Early life and education Joel Shapiro grew up in Sunnyside, Queens, New York. He graduated from Bayside High School (Bayside, NY) in 1959, at which time the school‚Äôs yearbook awarded him the title of Man About Town. When he was twenty two he lived in India for two years while in the Peace Corps.Klein, Michele Gerber http://bombsite.com/issues/109/articles/3332 BOMB Magazine Fall 2009, Retrieved July 25, 2011 He received a B.A. in 1964 and an M.A. in 1969 from New York University Work and inspiration While serving his Peace Corp time in India, Shapiro saw many Indian art works, and has said that \\"India gave me the sense of ‚Ä¶ the possibility of being an artist.\\" In India \\"Art was pervasive and integral to the society\\", and he has said that \\"the struggle in my work to find a structure that reflects real psychological states may well use Indian sculpture as a model.\\" His early work, which also drew inspiration from Greek art, is characterized by some by its small size, but Shapiro has discounted this perception, describing his early works as, \\"all about scale and the small size was an aspect of their scale\\". He described scale as \\"A very active thing that's changing and altering as time unfolds, consciously or unconsciously,\\" and, \\"a relationship of size and an experience. You can have something small that has big scale.\\" In these works he said that he was trying \\"to describe an emotional state, my own longing or desire\\". He also said that during this early period in his career he was interested in the strategies of artists Robert Morris, Richard Serra, Carl Andre, and Donald Judd. By the 1980s, Shapiro began to explore larger and life-size forms in pieces that were still reminiscent of Indian and Greek sculpture but also inspired by the early modernist works by Edgar Degas and Constantin Br√¢ncusi. The bulk of these pieces have been commissioned or acquired by museums and galleries. Later, Shapiro further expanded his repertoire by creating pieces that depicted the dynamism of human form. For instance, his subjects were portrayed in the act of dancing, crouching, and falling, among others that explored the themes of balance, cantilever, projection, and compression. His later works can have the appearance of flying, being impossibly suspended in space, and/or defying gravity. He has said about this shift in his work that he \\"wanted to make work that stood on its own, and wasn't limited by architecture and by the ground and the wall and right angles.\\" These can be demonstrated in the case of the large-size outdoor art he made for the Hood Museum of Art. The bronze piece was an attenuated form that leans over a walkway and its near-falling form is viewed as an energizing element in the museum's courtyard. This sculpture, like all of Shapiro's mature works, are untitled.

It contains the AT&T; Building, the AT&T; Building addition, the Maintenance Shop and is owned by communications giant AT&T.; Architecture AT&T; Building The AT&T; Building (formerly known as the SBC Building, the Ameritech Building and the Michigan Bell Building) was completed for the Michigan Bell Telephone Company in 1919Construction began on the original 7-story Michigan Bell headquarters building in 1917 and was completed in 1919 according to Michigan Bell's company newsletter The Michigan Bell, February 1929, et al and contract information in The American Contractor of November 3, 1917. and expanded in 1928. It is located at 1365 Cass Avenue, and occupies the block bordered by First Street, Cass Avenue, State Street, and Michigan Avenue. The AT&T; Building stands 19 stories tall. The original 7-story structure completed in 1919 was designed to accommodate additional floors as needed. Construction of the 12-story addition began in June 1927, and was completed in September 1928. Several horizontal bands of limestone mark the top of the original structure. The high-rise building is used as the Michigan headquarters for communications giant AT&T.; It is designed in the Art Deco and Art moderne architectural styles, using tan brick and limestone for the fa√ßade. Windows are grouped in twos divided by brick piers and have bronze spandrel panels below depicting lightning bolts, bells and other symbols related to communication. Windows on floors 17 through 19 are recessed and framed by large arches. The facade is finished by limestone balustrade and copper mansard roof. The architectural firm of Smith Hinchman & Grylls designed both the original 7-story building, with work done by Pontiac Construction, and the 12-story addition, with construction by the H. G. Christman-Burke Company, now The Christman Company of Lansing, Michigan. The design for the 1919 building included the future addition of 12 floors. However, when Michigan Bell made the decision to construct the additional floors, the design had become outdated. Wirt C. Rowland, Chief Designer for Smith, Hinchman & Grylls, devised a new plan which resulted in a more modern look without requiring significant alterations of the original building. The maintenance shop is a nine-story structure added in 1950 to the west of the original building facing First Street and State Streets. It is faced with tan brick with pink granite covering the lower two floors. The AT&T; Building Addition stands at 444 Michigan Avenue and occupies the site south of the earlier building. It was constructed in 1973 and finished the following year. The skyscraper office building stands at 21 stories, although floors 18-20 are only accessible by the service elevator or stairs, and floor 21 by stairs only. There are also three other hidden floors, 7M, 13 and 15M, which are also only accessible by service elevator or stairs. The building houses office space and telecommunications equipment and was designed in the modern architectural style. It was faced with weathering steel, bronze-tinted glass and granite. Like the earlier building, it is designed to accommodate additional floors when the need arises. In subsequent alterations, the weathering steel was painted and a portico added at the Michigan Avenue entrance. The addition was also designed by the architecture firm of Smith Hinchman & Grylls. When the addition was completed, Young Woman and Her Suitors (Jeune fille et sa suite in French) by sculptor Alexander Calder was installed at the corner of Michigan and Cass Avenues. In 2006, the sculpture was removed for conservation and in October 2007, the communications company donated it to the Detroit Institute of Arts. It was installed in its new location in May 2008.

The film stars John Rubinstein as Zachariah, and Don Johnson as his friend Matthew, two gunfighters journeying through the American West. Cast *John Rubinstein as Zachariah *Pat Quinn as Belle Starr *Don Johnson as Matthew *Country Joe and The Fish as The Crackers *Elvin Jones as Job Cain *Doug Kershaw as The Fiddler *William Challee as Old Man *Robert Ball as Stage Manager *Dick Van Patten as The Dude *The James Gang as Job Cain's Band *White Lightnin' as Old Man's Band *The New York Rock Ensemble as Belle Starr's Band Production The film is loosely based on Hermann Hesse's 1922 novel Siddhartha, surrealistically adapted as a musical Western. Massot said his inspiration came from when he joined the Beatles in India, when they were studying Transcendental Meditation under Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in early 1968. Massot said he arrived to find only George Harrison and John Lennon there, after their bandmates had left the course early, and the two Beatles \\"locked into some sort of meditation duel ‚Ä¶ to see who was the stronger character\\". Massot initially asked Harrison to provide the film's soundtrack, following his work on Wonderwall, which Massot directed. According to Levon Helm of The Band, Harrison discussed making Zachariah as an Apple Films project starring Bob Dylan and The Band, in late 1968. The following April, Rolling Stone announced that Cream's drummer Ginger Baker and The Band were to be major players in the film. This film was billed as \\"The first electric Western\\". It features appearances and music supplied by rock bands from the 1970s, including the James Gang and Country Joe and the Fish as \\"The Cracker Band\\". Fiddler Doug Kershaw has a musical cameo as does Elvin Jones as a gunslinging drummer named Job Cain. Soundtrack The music and lyrics that appear in the movie soundtrack were written by: * \\"We're the Crackers\\" - Joe McDonald * \\"All I Need\\" - Joe McDonald * \\"Poor But Honest Crackers\\" - Joe McDonald and Barry Melton * \\"Country Fever\\" - The James Gang * \\"Laguna Salada\\" - Joe Walsh, Jim Fox, and Dale Peters * \\"Drum Solo\\" - Elvin Jones * \\"The Ballad of Job Cain\\" - Doug Kershaw * \\"Grave Digger\\" - Michael Kamen and Martin Fulterman * \\"Shy Ann\\" - Byard Ray * \\"Down in the Willow Garden\\" - Byard Ray, Obray Ramsey, and Arthur Gorson * \\"Camino Waltz\\" - John Rubinstein The Minneapolis group White Lightnin' performs their rock and roll version of the William Tell Overture on the soundtrack. The New York Rock & Roll Ensemble perform Grave Digger. The soundtrack features songs by the James Gang, Joe Walsh, and Country Joe and the Fish. Zachariah (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack), the soundtrack album, was released in 1971 as a vinyl LP by Probe Records, a subsidiary label owned by ABC Records.

Club, \\"I was sort of the Govinda character.\\" Roger Greenspun of The New York Times wrote in a review of the film \\"It is, at least in my experience, the first movie to parody the Western with the apparent intention of propagandizing homosexual love. I am aware that male relationships are a stock in trade of most Westerns and that, in Andy Warhol's brilliant 'Lonesome Cowboys,' there has already been a homosexual parody.\\" The film recorded a loss of $1,435,000.

Aschehoug was founded as a bookstore in 1872 on Egertorvet in Oslo by cousins, Hieronymus and Halvard Aschehoug. From the start the firm was involved in publishing in a modest way, its output consisting mainly of school books. In 1888, the company was taken over by William Martin Nygaard and Thorstein Lambrechts (1856-1933), who kept the name while expanding its operations.Thorstein Lambrechts (Store norske leksikon) In 1900 William Nygaard withdrew from the bookselling side of the business and established a publishing company, which was given the name H. Aschehoug & Co. (W. Nygaard). In 1935, following the death of William Nygaard, the publishing house turned into a corporation in connection with the inheritance settlement and Williams Nygaard's son, Mads Wiel Nygaard became the Executive Officer. Aschehoug published an increasing number of important books through the years. Important Norwegian authors first published by Aschehoug have included Nobel Prize laureate, Sigrid Undset, as well as Fridtjof Nansen, Johan Falkberget, Hans E. Kinck, Aksel Sandemose, Arne Garborg - all of them writers whose works are today regarded as classics of Norwegian literature. Operations Its publishing program is divided into three main categories - works of fiction, including books for children and younger readers; works of reference, popular science and handbooks on various hobbies, and serving as the leading Norwegian publishing house for textbooks, for every level of instruction.

After escaping from communist Czechoslovakia to the West he lived and worked in Canada and the United States. He currently resides in Kingston, New York. Biography In 1929, Tibor Spitz was born in a small town called Doln√Ω Kub√≠n in the high mountains of northern Slovakia, that time part of Czechoslovakia. His father was a cantor for the Jewish community and mother was a teacher. He survived Holocaust at age 15, studied chemistry in Prague and in 1968 escaped to the West to live in Canada and later in the United States. After his career as a scientist, he became a professional artist and lecturer on Holocaust. Tibor Spitz was born in a Slovak part of Czechoslovakia that kept changing from democracy to a fascist Nazi regime followed by the Soviet style communism. Because of his Jewish origin, between the ages 10 to 15 he was not allowed to attend public schools and for three years he was doomed to be either murdered on the spot or deported to a death camp in nearby Poland. He was 12 when almost all his deported relatives vanished without a trace in Nazi Death & Labor camps. After merely surviving the Nazi era he wanted to study art as did his older brother. However, the already established communist regime arranged for him to study chemistry. After graduations he worked as an engineer, Ph.D. scientist and glass technology expert in Czechoslovak glass industry Research and development institutions. In 1968 he was returning to complete his two years assignment in Cuban glass industry when he and his wife Noemi (during an airplane refueling stop in Canada) escaped to the West. Nine years later they moved from Canada to the United States. 30 years in glass industry had followed 14 years working as a scientist developing hi-tech magnetic recording heads for computers and VCRs. Suppressed memories of his tragic childhood required an outlet only art could fully provide. Communist country where he lived for two decades would not tolerate it, while political freedoms in the West fully supported his free artistic expressions. Next to his scientific and technical profession Tibor Spitz became simultaneously an active artist as well. The unusually creative artistic environment in both Kingston and nearby Woodstock, New York gradually turned him into a professional artist. As his interest in art continued growing, besides painting he has been also sculpting, making ceramics, wood carvings and wood burnings. When he discovered that impressionists have not fully exhausted all their artistic possibilities, his painting techniques gradually gravitated toward pointillism and neo-impressionism. Besides initial hounding faces and figurative scenes associated with Holocaust, Judaism and Jewish mystical teachings Kabbalah, he also added fishing scenes, musicians, horses, still- life and landscapes. College courses as well as directions from his mentor Meyer Lieberman were great help in developing his artistic skills. His art was exhibited in many solo and group shows. Galleries, museums, schools, colleges as well as cultural, scientific, religious and public institutions were interested in both his presentations and exhibitions. During last decades, solo exhibitions of his art were held numerous times in New York State, New Jersey, Canada, in his native Slovakia, in Prague, Art Society of Kingston, HCT, Gallery SEVEN21 and many others. In 1997 an American art historian Matthew Baigell included his biography and reproduction of his painting in his book \\"Jewish-American artists and the Holocaust\\". In 2008 a Canadian drama director V. Toth used his paintings in her book \\"Shalom\\" issued in both Canada. His achievements were described in dozens of media reports published in several countries. A documentary movie titled \\"TIBOR SPITZ - Portraits of successful Slovaks abroad\\" (2015) was shown in both Slovakia, Canada and on Slovak Television. References 2\\\\. Valeria Tothova: SHALOM.

A very large amount of weight can be lifted this way, compared to other types of one-hand press. It has been said that more weight can be lifted with one hand in this manner than in the typical two-handed overhead barbell press. It was a staple of the old-time strongmen and strongwomen such as Eugen Sandow, Arthur Saxon, and Louis Cyr, but is no longer popular. Like any exercise that is attempted without proper progression and full understanding, it poses safety concerns due to the thoracic rotation, and core strength required. However, proponents of the exercise argue that, since it uses the leverage of the body in order to lift the weight, if progressed to and performed correctly, it is a safe exercise. Despite its name, the arm does not press the weight aloft. Method Bottom position where the athlete has come fully under the weight. To do the bent press, one would begin by lifting the weight to the shoulder (usually a barbell, but it could be done with a kettlebell or dumbbell), either by a one or two handed clean, or by lifting one end and \\"rocking\\" it onto the shoulder. If done with the right hand (the reverse is done for the left hand), the right leg would be straight and directly underneath the weight, with the left leg bent at a slight angle. The lifter would then bend to the left, holding the weight in the same position. The bent position, the origin of the name \\"bent press\\", allows the arm to hold the weight in position without dropping down because of the body's leverage, creating an imaginary line between the bell and the floor that travels through the right arm and right leg. The lifter continues to bend to the left until the arm is fully extended. The weight is not pressed, but held aloft while bending \\"underneath it\\". To complete the lift, after the arm is fully extended, the lifter does a slight corkscrew to get \\"underneath the weight\\" in a half or full squat position, again without pressing the weight, and then once underneath the weight with the arm locked out overhead holding the weight, the lifter stands erect, still holding the weight overhead. The weight can either be dropped or lowered in military press fashion after the lift is complete. > A key element of this lift is balance. The lifter should stare at the weight > once shouldered and while the arm moves to a locked position overhead. In > reality, the lifter bends his body and shoulder away from the weight, > bending the opposite leg to help lower the shoulder away from the weight. > The whole arm that holds the weight sort of rests on the lifter's back on > that side. The opposite arm is held straight out for balance as well. > Although most of the lockout is achieved by bending away from the weight, > some pressing of the arm is also employed. The only real danger I ever found > in this lift was dropping it on things if balance was lost (once on my > mother's suitcase). A lifter can easily move away from the weight if it > falls.

Without good shoulder flexibility, a tear could occur. > Dumbbells are harder to control than a long bar of the same weight as the > longer bar will turn or rotate much more slowly while being moved. - Dale > Rhoades, owner of the Des Moines Strength Institute Records The world record in the bent press is by Arthur Saxon, but there were unofficial reports of him bent pressing .

Alex Anderson) (June 6, 1894 ‚Äì May 29 or 30, 1995) was an American composer who was born and lived most of his life in Hawaii, writing many popular Hawaiian songs within the Hapa haole genre including \\"Lovely Hula Hands\\" (1940) and \\"Mele Kalikimaka\\" (1949), the latter the best known Hawaiian Christmas song. Background He was called \\"Andy\\" by his close friends. Anderson was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. He attended Punahou School where he wrote the school's football song in his junior year and the school song in his senior year. He graduated from Cornell University in 1916, where he studied electrical and mechanical engineering and was a member of the Cornell University Glee Club. Despite lacking formal training as a composer, he wrote many songs as a student there, including \\"When Twilight Falls on Blue Cayuga\\". In 1927, he wrote his first hit song, \\"Haole Hula\\". Another well- known song of his was \\"Punahou\\" (1966). His exploits during World War I involved flying combat missions in France. After being shot down and taken as a prisoner of war by the Germans, Anderson conceived of a daring and ultimately successful escape. This was later turned into a movie. Although he had a very active business career, he turned his love of songwriting into a very successful avocation. While Anderson never studied theory or harmony and played a piano mostly by ear, many of his over 100 island songs have become standards. He usually composed away from an instrument, although he sometimes used a piano or ukulele to work out a melody. In 1939, as a result of a chance remark, Anderson was inspired to write his most popular song, \\"Lovely Hula Hands\\". After watching a hula dancer at a party, he heard someone say, \\"aren't her hands lovely?\\" After it was performed by Harry Owens and his band on a Honolulu radio station, it became an instant hit. It has been recorded by dozens of artists, including Bing Crosby and Alfred Apaka. Several of Anderson's songs had movie star associations. \\"Mele Kalikimaka\\" was first recorded by his friend Bing Crosby. \\"Cockeyed Mayor of Kaunakakai\\" was written in the 1930s for a party honoring the actor Warner Baxter. \\"White Ginger Blossoms\\" was written at the suggestion of film star Mary Pickford. Anderson was considered the \\"most Hawaiian\\" of the hapa haole composers, following in the footsteps of songwriters like Charles E. King, using traditional Hawaiian musical qualities and themes.

Marquess or Marchioness of Galatone (Marchese o Marchesa di Galatone) is a noble title created by the Kings of Spain for Stefano Squarciafico, Patrician of Genoa, on 29 June 1562, and inherited according to Spanish nobiliary law. The title is currently held by the Prince or Princess Belmonte, and may be used as a courtesy title. Creation of the title The feudality of Galatone was acquired in 1557 by Uberto Squarciafico of Genoa, who died on 8 February 1562 leaving his property to his son Don Stefano. On 29 June of that year, the title Marquess of Galatone was conferred on Stefano by King Philip II of Spain, son of Emperor Charles V. Stefano married Vittoria Doria. He died in 1568, and is buried in the family's Chapel, the Cappella di San Marco, at Copertino Castle. Succession *Giulio Cesare, younger son of Uberto, succeeded his brother Don Stefano as 2nd Marquess of Galatone in 1568, and was placed under the guardianship of Uberto's sister Livia and her husband Galeazzo Pinelli owing to his youth. Livia had been given the County of Copertino by Uberto, as a dowry on her marriage. Giulio Cesare married Lelia Spinola, daughter of the Duke of Sesto and Marquess of Venafro (Filippo Spinola). As a widow, Lelia married on 27 November 1585 Gian Francesco Oliva Grimaldi, 2nd Duke of Terranova and Seigneur of Gerace. Her son by that marriage, Girolamo Oliva Grimaldi, was created 1st Prince of Gerace. *Cosimo, son of Galeazzo and Livia, succeeded to the lands, Castle and title as 3rd Marquess of Galatone in 1588. From his mother he also inherited the title Count of Copertino. He married Nicoletta Grillo (died 28 October 1617). Cosimo was responsible for the construction of the Church and Convent of San Francesco in Galatone in 1599-1600 at his own expense, dedicating it to the care of the Capuchins and reserving the Chapel of the Immacolata as a family crypt. Cosimo died in 1601. *Galeazzo (II) Francesco, only son of Cosimo and Nicoletta, was created 1st Duke of Acerenza on 12 April 1593 by Philip II of Spain. He succeeded his father in 1602 as 4th Marquess of Galatone and Count of Copertino. Galeazzo's daughter Donna Caterina also resided at Galatone, and is buried in the Chapel of the Immacolata, along with her cousin Donna Nicoletta, daughter of Galeazzo (I). *Cosimo (II) succeeded as 2nd Duke of Acerenza, 5th Marquess of Galatone and Count of Copertino, and married Anna Maria Ravaschieri, daughter of Orazio Giovan Battista Ravaschieri Fieschi, 1st Prince of Belmonte, bringing her from the convent where she had been enclosed. Together they had nine children. *Don Gaetano Pinelli, second son of Duke Cosimo and Duchess Anna Maria, succeeded to as 3rd Duke of Acerenza, 6th Marquess of Galatone and Count of Copertino, since his elder brother Don Gaetano Antonio was considered fool. Duke Gaetano died at Belmonte (now Belmonte Calabro) in 1711, with no direct heir. His titles and lands therefore passed to his first cousin, who was nephew to the 3rd Duchess, Anna Maria. *Oronzo Ravaschieri Fieschi Pinelli, 5th Prince of Belmonte, succeeded to the Dukedom of Acerenza as 4th Duke, the Marquisate of Galatone as 7th Marquess, and the Earldom (Contea) of Copertino.

The two major two-chromosome mutations: insertion (1) and Translocation (2). A chromosomal disorder, anomaly, aberration, or mutation is a missing, extra, or irregular portion of chromosomal DNA.NHGRI. 2006. Chromosome Abnormalities It can be from a typical number of chromosomes or a structural abnormality in one or more chromosomes. Chromosome mutation was formerly used in a strict sense to mean a change in a chromosomal segment, involving more than one gene. The term \\"karyotype\\" refers to the full set of chromosomes from an individual; this can be compared to a \\"normal\\" karyotype for the species via genetic testing. A chromosome anomaly may be detected or confirmed in this manner. Chromosome anomalies usually occur when there is an error in cell division following meiosis or mitosis. There are many types of chromosome anomalies. They can be organized into two basic groups, numerical and structural anomalies. Numerical abnormality  This is called aneuploidy (an abnormal number of chromosomes), and occurs when an individual either is missing a chromosome from a pair (monosomy) or has more than two chromosomes of a pair (trisomy, tetrasomy, etc.). An example of trisomy in humans is Down syndrome, which is a developmental disorder caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21; the disorder is therefore also called trisomy 21. Having an extra copy of this chromosome means that individuals have three copies of each of its genes instead of two, making it difficult for cells to properly control how much protein is made. Producing too much or too little protein can have serious consequences. Genes on chromosome 21 that specifically contribute to the various symptoms of Down syndrome are now being identified. The frequency of Trisomy 21 has been determined to be a function of advanced maternal age. An example of monosomy is Turner syndrome, where the individual is born with only one sex chromosome, an X. Sperm aneuploidy Exposure of male to certain lifestyle, environmental and/or occupational hazards may increase the risk of aneuploid spermatozoa. In particular, risk of aneuploidy is increased by tobacco smoking, and occupational exposure to benzene, insecticides, and perfluorinated compounds. Increased aneuploidy is often associated with increased DNA damage in spermatozoa. Structural abnormalities When the chromosome's structure is altered, this can take several forms: *Deletions: A portion of the chromosome is missing or deleted. Known disorders in humans include Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, which is caused by partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 4; and Jacobsen syndrome, also called the terminal 11q deletion disorder. *Duplications: A portion of the chromosome is duplicated, resulting in extra genetic material. Known human disorders include Charcot- Marie-Tooth disease type 1A, which may be caused by duplication of the gene encoding peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) on chromosome 17. *Translocations: A portion of one chromosome is transferred to another chromosome. There are two main types of translocations: **Reciprocal translocation: Segments from two different chromosomes have been exchanged. **Robertsonian translocation: An entire chromosome has attached to another at the centromere - in humans these only occur with chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22. *Inversions: A portion of the chromosome has broken off, turned upside down, and reattached, therefore the genetic material is inverted. *Insertions: A portion of one chromosome has been deleted from its normal place and inserted into another chromosome. *Rings: A portion of a chromosome has broken off and formed a circle or ring. This can happen with or without loss of genetic material. *Isochromosome: Formed by the mirror image copy of a chromosome segment including the centromere. Chromosome instability syndromes are a group of disorders characterized by chromosomal instability and breakage. They often lead to an increased tendency to develop certain types of malignancies. Inheritance Most chromosome abnormalities occur as an accident in the egg cell or sperm, and therefore the anomaly is present in every cell of the body. Some anomalies, however, can happen after conception, resulting in Mosaicism (where some cells have the anomaly and some do not). Chromosome anomalies can be inherited from a parent or be \\"de novo\\". This is why chromosome studies are often performed on parents when a child is found to have an anomaly. If the parents do not possess the abnormality it was not initially inherited; however it may be transmitted to subsequent generations. Acquired chromosome abnormalities Most cancers, if not all, could cause chromosome abnormalities, with either the formation of hybrid genes and fusion proteins, deregulation of genes and overexpression of proteins, or loss of tumor suppressor genes (see the \\"Mitelman Database\\" and the Atlas of Genetics and Cytogenetics in Oncology and Haematology,). Furthermore, certain consistent chromosomal abnormalities can turn normal cells into a leukemic cell such as the translocation of a gene, resulting in its inappropriate expression. DNA damage during spermatogenesis During the mitotic and meiotic cell divisions of mammalian gametogenesis, DNA repair is effective at removing DNA damages. However, in spermatogenesis the ability to repair DNA damages decreases substantially in the latter part of the process as haploid spermatids undergo major nuclear chromatin remodeling into highly compacted sperm nuclei. As reviewed by Marchetti et al., the last few weeks of sperm development before fertilization are highly susceptible to the accumulation of sperm DNA damage. Such sperm DNA damage can be transmitted unrepaired into the egg where it is subject to removal by the maternal repair machinery. However, errors in maternal DNA repair of sperm DNA damage can result in zygotes with chromosomal structural aberrations. Melphalan is a bifunctional alkylating agent frequently used in chemotherapy. Meiotic inter-strand DNA damages caused by melphalan can escape paternal repair and cause chromosomal aberrations in the zygote by maternal misrepair. Thus both pre- and post-fertilization DNA repair appear to be important in avoiding chromosome abnormalities and assuring the genome integrity of the conceptus.  Detection  Depending on the information one wants to obtain, different techniques and samples are needed. * For the prenatal diagnosis of a foetus, amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling or circulating foetal cells would be collected and analysed in order to detect possible chromosomal abnormalities. * For the preimplantational diagnosis of an embryo, a blastocyst biopsy would be performed. * For a lymphoma or leukemia screening the technique used would be a bone marrow biopsy.

Morey (November 13, 1946 ‚Äì January 5, 2019) was a Christian apologist and pastor who wrote a number of books and pamphlets. He criticized Islam, Wicca, and non-Evangelical Christian beliefs. He was the founder of the unaccredited California Biblical University and Seminary.Faculty page at California Biblical University and Seminary. Biography Morey ran Faith Defenders, an organization dedicated to Christian apologetics, and started the related Faith Community Church in Orange, California as pastor, which recently closed upon his departure to Pennsylvania where he began his ministry. He received a B.A. from Covenant College. Morey then earned a Master of Divinity and Doctor of Ministry from the fully accredited Westminster Theological Seminary. Morey received another Doctorate (D.Litt. and Phil.) from The University of America which is authorized to grant bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees by the State of Florida and the U.S.http://ua-edu.us UA is also registered as a high school in California. Other degrees and honors held by Morey include a Doctor of Philosophy in Islamic Studies from the unaccredited Louisiana Baptist UniversityAbout us, Faith Defenders (although elsewhere he has said it is actually a doctorate in theology with an emphasis on Islam) and a Doctor of Divinity, usually an honorary degree bestowed upon someone who has made distinguished contributions to the field of religion, from Faith Theological Seminary. His honorary degree is from Faith Theological Seminary in Gujranwala, Pakistan, and the Pakistan seminary created controversy over whether this degree was bestowed (and later rescinded) by them. Morey assisted in translation for the International Standard Version of the Bible; he worked on the \\"base translation\\" of Psalms chapters 1 through 65 and Psalms chapter 91. In 2002, the conservative website WorldNetDaily published a fund-raising plea on behalf of Morey's Research and Education Foundation. He was asking for $1.2 million to \\"launch a national crusade\\" against radical Islam. Tax records obtained by the Weekly show the fund-raiser failed to hit its target, raising just $92,707 for his Research and Education Foundation in 2002. In 2005, Morey filed for and received nonprofit status for his Faith Defenders Ministry by turning it into an Irvine church. There, Morey offered membership in the Crusader's Club, which lists four membership levels along with corresponding dues and benefits, ranging from Crusader ($300 per year earns you a CD of the month) to King Richard's Court ($5,000 per year gets you the CD, a mug, a subscription to Morey's Journal of Biblical Apologetics, Morey‚Äôs private e-mail address, a piece of battle armor and an invitation to the annual Crusader‚Äôs Club banquet). In 2009, Morey announced he would leave California and returned to South Central Pennsylvania, living outside of Harrisburg in Perry County, Pennsylvania. Morey's wife, Anne, died June 3, 2012, in Florida, where the couple were celebrating their 40th wedding anniversary. According to police, \\"Anne Morey was planning to dive with her husband, 65-year-old Robert Morey... But he discovered he did not have enough weight. His wife told him she would go ahead and dive to the bottom and wait for him there\\" and when he came back she was dead. Claims and work Dirty bombs in the United States  In March 2002, Morey was interviewed by Mark Ellis, assistant pastor at Calvary Evangelical Free Church in Laguna Beach. Based on that conversation, Ellis wrote \\"Islam Expert Warns of [Three] Nuclear Terror Devices Inside U.S.,\\" an article for the Christian news service ASSIST. Morey explained in the interview \\"I have Middle Eastern friends throughout the U.S. who continually feed me information as to what the terrorists are up to\\". \\"I, in turn, feed that information to the FBI and Naval Intelligence. I've been right so many times the FBI showed up at my house, suspicious as to whether or not I was somehow involved‚Äîbecause I knew too much. I simply pointed out to them they don't have their ear to the ground in the Middle Eastern community.\\" Anti-Islamic comic book In Spring 2006 the Fullerton, California based Davidson Press and Morey fought over the rights to publish the comic book Mohammed's Believe It or Else!. Davidson Press allowed internet users to download the comics for free until the Danish cartoons controversy drew interest to anti-Islamic comic books (the website went from 1,000 visitors to 180,000 visitors a week). At that point \\"Morey ‚Äî who owns the copyright to MBIE‚Äîdemanded that Davidson Press cease free distribution\\" and \\"refused Davidson Press's demand to be reimbursed for the costs of translating MBIE into 34 languages and maintaining islamcomicbook.com.\\" Davidson accused Morey of stopping the free downloading for money, since the comic is on sale for $6.95 on Morey's website. The publisher accused Morey of having \\"questionable ethics,\\" but still recommends his books. Islamic writings Morey has written several books condemning Islam. In The Islamic Invasion, he challenges the Islamic claims that Allah is the same God as that of the Christian Bible, that Muhammad was God's prophet, and that the Quran contains the words of God. Morey has also written predictions that World War III will be caused by Islam. According to an article in the Orange County Weekly, in November 2001 Morey told a San Diego church audience that he had advised the State Department to blow up Mecca and Medina (Muslim holy cities) in order to win the war on terror quickly, but the State Department had not taken his advice because it is \\"full of wusses.\\" Daniel Pipes said of Morey in a 1998 Middle East Quarterly book review that Robert Morey \\"sees Islam primarily as 'a form of cultural imperialism' that seeks to impose the ways of seventh-century Arabia on twentieth-century America.\\" A detailed (18 page) criticism of Morey's methods has been written by Shabir Ally, President of the Islamic Information and Da'wah Centre International, Toronto, Canada, who charges Morey with deception, contradictions, and poor scholarship. One of the better known and most controversial assertions Morey made about Islam is that God in Islam is in origin the \\"moon god\\" Hubal, a deity worshipped at the Kaaba in pre-Islamic Arabia.\\"Gregory Starrett, \\"Islam and the Politics of Enchantment\\", Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, May 2009, vol. 15. S222-S240. Morey argues that the same name of God of Islam, Arabic Allah, was an epithet of Hubal's in pre-Islamic Mecca. He also cites a 1950s era archeological excavation in Hazor, Israel, in what was ancient Galilee, in which a decapitated male statue was unearthed which some archaeologists thought might be Hubal. Morley claims that this provides that moon worship existed in Arabia. He argues that Muhammad adapted it to create Allah, thus supposedly explaining the use of crescent moon imagery in Islam. This \\"Allah as moon god\\" theory has been widely repeated, adapted and criticised.Jack G. Shaheen, Arab and Muslim Stereotyping in American Popular Culture, Centre For Muslim- Christian Understanding, Georgetown University Occasional Papers, p. 8. Claims against atheists Jon Nelson also has criticized Morey for incorrect quotes.Jon Nelson. The Dishonesty of Theism. Atheist Alliance, 2006. Nelson notes that in Morey's The New Atheism (1986) he quoted Nicholas Capaldi's book The Art of Deception as an example of atheist deception, but the \\"problem is that Capaldi never says this (or anything like it) on this or on any other page. Morey has numerous other false quotes attributed to Capaldi, such as: 'Refuse to be convinced. Even if you feel that he has a good argument and that your case is weaker, refuse to be convinced of your opponent's case'. Nowhere does Capaldi advocate, as Morey accuses him of doing, that atheists should 'use any invalid or deceptive argument as long as it helps him (to) win his case.'\\" Nelson goes on to say that, \\"However, Morey has an 'out'. There are no actual quotation marks on these alleged quotes.\\" Morey gained the attention of debate coordinator Brian Boothe, who organized a debate between Morey and Erik Wielenberg of DePauw University on The Infidel Guy Radio Show program. The debate addressed whether or not atheism was a more sustainable position than theism. Death Morey died on January 5, 2019.

It was named after the whale in the novel Moby- Dick by Herman Melville. Illustration of Herman Melville's fictional white whale, Moby Dick, the namesake of the Rhine's beluga visitor On May 18, 1966, a few Rhine skippers near Duisburg reported a white whale in the Rhine to the water police. Officials reacted with incredulity and made the mariners take a blood alcohol test, which came up negative. In fact, there really was a , 3,500-pound white whale swimming in the Rhine 300 kilometers from the ocean and thousands of kilometers from the natural beluga habitat in arctic waters. Moby Dick, it was later surmised, had likely been captured on the East Coast of Canada and put on a freighter and sent to a zoo in England. Shortly before landing, a storm in the English channel threw the container with Moby overboard who disappeared, before reappearing months later far up the Rhine river. Wolfgang Gewalt, the director of the Duisburg Zoo, tried to subdue the unusual guest in the Rhine with nets and tranquilizer darts. This led to massive protests from the people and official protests from the Netherlands so they had to desist. At first Moby Dick turned oceanward again, but stopped in front of a lock to the ocean opened specially for him, and swam up the Rhine again, as far as Bonn. Once there he turned around and was sighted three days later, on the June 16 at 18:42, for the last time after reaching the open ocean at Hoek van Holland. \\"Moby Dick\\" found its way to the Rhine River. A belugas' natural habitat is in the Arctic. A Beluga whale at the Atlanta aquarium. Observers noted that the normally white whale's skin appeared bumpy with dark splotches, apparently altered by the polluted waters of the Rhine river. The Rhine was justifiably characterized as a sewer, since waste water from cities and chemical plants was for the most part poured in unfiltered. There is a suggestion that the appearance of Moby Dick in the Rhine and the effect the polluted water seemed to visibly have on the whale was the beginning of the environmental movement in Germany. In fact, around 1966 the first effective environmental protection laws in Germany were adopted.

The name might equally apply to several other species in the tribe Nezarini, or if referred-to as a \\"green stink bug\\", it might more appropriately belong to the larger North American bug, Acrosternum hilare. The adult green shield bug ranges in the colour of their backs from bright green to bronze, without any substantial markings. Green shield bugs are a very common shield bug throughout Europe, including the British Isles, and are found in a large variety of habitats, including gardens. They have been found as far north as 63¬∞ N latitude. Life cycle In Europe, the bright green shield bugs appear in April or May, having hibernated as imagos during the winter. They fatten for a month and then mate in June. The imago's coloration changes over the summer months from green to greenish browns even bronze, after which the life cycle will end. Mating is back-to-back. The female lays her eggs in hexagonal batches of 25 to 30, and a single female will lay three to four batches. After the eggs hatch, the green shield bug enter a larval stage (which is really their first nymphal stage) where, in general, they remain together in sibling communities. This is made possible by the excretion of an aggregation pheromone. In case of danger, another pheromone is released which causes dispersal. The larval stage is followed by four more nymphal stages as well as moulting between each one. The green shield bug displays different colouration during each nymphal stage, light brown, black or green- black, and in the final stage, the imago, is bright green with short wings. Usually the imago stage is reached in September, with hibernation occurring in November.

New is about an 8-year-old boy who is turned into a 28-year-old man by a scientist. New was simultaneously shot in Telugu as Naani with Mahesh Babu. The movie's plot is adapted from the 1988 Hollywood Tom Hanks starrer Big. Plot summary Pappu is a mischievous eight-year-old boy who always troubling his mother Indira. He frequently gets scoldings due to his bed- wetting habit despite being an eight year old. Pappu's elder brother Kishore plans to watch a porn movie with his friends in his room to which he insists on joining them. When Kishore refuses and gets rid of him, Pappu cuts off the power out of anger creating a short circuit at home. Indira scolds for his dangerous mischief and shouts at her husband for not stopping with one child as Pappu is troubling her a lot and to throw him away forever. Distraught, Pappu runs away from home to end his life near a river, but is stopped by a man who takes him to his place. The man introduces himself as a scientist who has his own laboratory. He insists Pappu to take a medicine invented by him which will transform a boy to a fully grown man. Pappu agrees and the scientist transforms him into a young man. Pappu starts to live as a young man physically but he is childlike psychologically. The only person other than a scientist who knows the truth is his child classmate friend. Now an adult, Pappu goes for an interview in a toy manufacturing company under the name of Vichu. The owner interviewing him demands that he empatize children to understand their taste. Since Pappu/Vichu is a child he grabs the job easily. Vichu is diverted to the daughter of the owner, Priya, whom Pappu/Vichu helped her to her feet at an amusement park before. She is surprised and happy to see him in her company and love blossoms between them. The Priya-Vichu intimacy creates a jealousy for Raj, another employee in the company who intends to woo her and humiliate Vichu. Pappu/Vichu meets Kishore as an anonymous man and learns that his mother is very depressed and fell sick following her son's disappearance. She laments for being so strict with him which she had done for his well being. Pappu realizes his mother's love and goes to the scientist to revert him to his younger self. The scientist transforms Pappu into his younger self and he reconciles with his mother. But again at night, he changes back to a young man and he immediately rushes to the scientist who does not know what had gone wrong and both of them are shocked at Pappu's mishap. Pappu now lives as an eight-year-old boy during daytime and as a twenty-eight-year man during the night. Priya expresses her love to him but Pappu/Vichu tells her to love a man suitable for her age, but reciprocates his love upon the scientist's coersion. One day, Priya tells him to accompany for a matinee show, to which he rejects due to his transformation mishap. Pappu's mother befriends Priya as they are neighbours and Priya likes small boy Pappu. Priya gets angry on Vichu's absence. She finally decides to marry him. Raj kidnaps Vichu on the day of marriage but he changes to Pappu during the daytime. The kidnappers release him as they misunderstand of kidnapping a child. Pappu transforms to Vichu and marries Priya at evening time (Hindu marriages take place usually at mornings). Pappu somehow manages his mother by disappearing during nights. Priya longs for a child, so they have sex. Vichu/Pappu meets his mother and understands the difficulties of pregnancy, prompting him to take care of his wife with full affection. Pappu's child friend demands to spend time and come to play with him but Pappu refuses as has got the tight schedule as a son, as an employee, and as a husband.

J. Surya in 2000, where he reported that Ajith Kumar and Jyothika would play the lead roles in the film, with Kareena Kapoor in a guest appearance. Surya noted that script-writing began in 2001, while production with the final cast began in 2002. Release The film was given an \\"A\\" certificate (adult rating) by the Indian Censor Board. New sold almost 4 million tickets worldwide. It opened well grossing 1.12 crore from 120 screens on Day One. A critic from The Hindu claimed that \\"belonging to a genre that is rare to our cinema, \\"New\\" however, gets bogged down in a mire of duets and double entenders\\", but hinted at potential success citing that director \\"seems to have hit the bull's eye.\\" Controversy Women activists in the state of Tamil Nadu demanded a ban on a film after release, which they say contained obscene sex scenes. S. J. Surya responded by claiming that the sex scenes are there because the story line requires them and described his film as \\"fiction laced with sex and comedy\\". In August 2005, the Madras High Court revoked the censor certificate for the film and directed the Chennai Commissioner of Police to investigate two criminal complaints registered against S. J. Surya. They ruled that the film did not provide a \\"clean and healthy entertainment\\" and that it would be failing in its duty if it did not revoke the censor certificate of the film, claiming it originally attained an \\"A\\" certificate \\"under questionable circumstances\\". Surya was arrested by city police on 22 August 2005 in connection for allegedly throwing a mobile phone at a woman censor board official in a fit of anger during the post-production of the film. According to the complainant, Vanathy Srinivasan, Surya was denied permission to add a song to the film New due to excessively obscene scenes and as a result he allegedly threw a mobile phone at her. He was late released without charge. A fresh case was launched in March 2006, with the Censor Board filing a complaint against Surya for using stills from scenes that were deleted from the film, with a poster which showed S.J. Surya resting on Simran's cleavage resurfacing. He was subsequently arrested for the second time before being released. Soundtrack The soundtrack was composed by A. R. Rahman. In an interview in 2001, Surya earlier stated that Deva had composed ten songs for the film, but he was later replaced by Rahman. director requested Rahman to remix the 1964 hit Tamil song \\"Thottal Poo Malarum\\" from the movie Padagotti but Rahman was not happy with the idea and next day he came up with completely new and fresh tune. Remakes It was Remade in Hindi again as Aao Wish Karein which was both produced and starring Aftab Shivdasani while Simran's role was done by Aamna Shariff and Manivannan's and Devayani's role was done by Johny Lever and Rati Agnihotri respectively.
