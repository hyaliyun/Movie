In June 2020, astronomers from the University of Nottingham reported the possible existence of over 30 \\"active communicating intelligent civilizations\\", or Communicating Extra-Terrestrial Intelligent (CETI) civilizations (none within our current ability to detect due to various reasons including distance or size) in our own Milky Way galaxy, based on the latest astrophysical information. Probability The Copernican principle is generalized to the relativistic concept that humans are not privileged observers of the universe. Many prominent scientists, including Stephen Hawking have proposed that the sheer scale of the universe makes it improbable for intelligent life not to have emerged elsewhere. However, Fermi's Paradox highlights the apparent contradiction between high estimates of the probability of the existence of extraterrestrial civilization and humanity's lack of contact with, or evidence for, such civilizations. The Kardashev scale is a speculative method of measuring a civilization's level of technological advancement, based on the amount of energy a civilization is able to utilize.Kardashev, Nikolai. \\"On the Inevitability and the Possible Structures of Supercivilizations\\", The search for extraterrestrial life: Recent developments; Proceedings of the Symposium, Boston, MA, June 18‚Äì21, 1984 (A86-38126 17-88).

The Drake equation is a probabilistic argument used to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy. Search for extraterrestrial intelligence There has been a search for signals from extraterrestrial intelligence for several decades, with no solid results.\\"The search for ET is a detective story without a body\\" by Nigel Henbest, New Scientist, March 9, 2013, p. 53. Active SETI (Active Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) is the attempt to send messages to intelligent extraterrestrial life. Active SETI messages are usually sent in the form of radio signals. Physical messages like that of the Pioneer plaque may also be considered an active SETI message. Communication with extraterrestrial intelligence (CETI) is a branch of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence that focuses on composing and deciphering messages that could theoretically be understood by another technological civilization. The best-known CETI experiment was the 1974 Arecibo message composed by Frank Drake and Carl Sagan. There are multiple independent organizations and individuals engaged in CETI research. The U.S. government's position is that \\"chances of contact with an extraterrestrial intelligence are extremely small, given the distances involved.\\" The Wow! signal remains the best candidate for an extraterrestrial radio signal ever detected.  Potential cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact  The potential changes from extraterrestrial contact could vary greatly in magnitude and type, based on the extraterrestrial civilization's level of technological advancement, degree of benevolence or malevolence, and level of mutual comprehension between itself and humanity. Some theories suggest that an extraterrestrial civilization could be advanced enough to dispense with biology, living instead inside of advanced computers. The medium through which humanity is contacted, be it electromagnetic radiation, direct physical interaction, extraterrestrial artefact, or otherwise, may also influence the results of contact. Incorporating these factors, various systems have been created to assess the implications of extraterrestrial contact. The implications of extraterrestrial contact, particularly with a technologically superior civilization, have often been likened to the meeting of two vastly different human cultures on Earth, an historical precedent being the Columbian Exchange. Such meetings have generally led to the destruction of the civilization receiving contact (as opposed to the \\"contactor\\", which initiates contact), and therefore destruction of human civilization is a possible outcome. However, the absence of any such contact to date means such conjecture is largely speculative. UFOlogy The extraterrestrial hypothesis is the idea that some UFOs are vehicles containing or sent by extraterrestrial beings (usually called aliens in this context). As an explanation for UFOs, ETI is sometimes contrasted with EDI (extradimensional intelligence), for example by Allen Hynek.

They are not known to have any genetic relationship to each other; their only common link is that they are held to have antedated the more dominant languages, particularly Tungusic and latterly Turkic languages, that have largely displaced them. Even more recently, Turkic (at least in Siberia) and especially Tungusic have been displaced in their turn by Russian. Classifications Four small language families and isolates are usually considered to be Paleo-Siberian languages: # The Chukotko-Kamchatkan family, sometimes known as Luoravetlan, includes Chukchi and its close relatives, Koryak, Alutor and Kerek. Itelmen, also known as Kamchadal, is also distantly related. Chukchi, Koryak and Alutor are spoken in easternmost Siberia by communities numbering in the thousands (Chukchi) or hundreds (Koryak and Alutor). Kerek is extinct, and Itelmen is now spoken by fewer than 5 people, mostly elderly, on the west coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula. # Nivkh (Gilyak, Amuric) consists of two or three languages spoken in the lower Amur basin and on the northern half of Sakhalin island. It has a recent modern literature. # Yukaghir is spoken in two mutually unintelligible varieties in the lower Kolyma and Indigirka valleys. Other languages, including Chuvantsy, spoken further inland and further east, are now extinct. Yukaghir is held by some to be related to the Uralic languages. # The Yeniseian languages were a small family formerly spoken on the middle Yenisei River and its tributaries, but are now represented only by Ket, spoken in the Turukhansk district of Krasnoyarsk Krai by no more than 200 people. On the basis of morphological, typological, and lexical evidence, Michael Fortescue suggests that Chukotko- Kamchatkan and Nivkh (Amuric) are related, forming a larger Chukotko- Kamchatkan-Amuric language family. Fortescue does not consider Yukaghir and Yeniseian to be genetically related to Chukotko-Kamchatkan-Amuric. =Other languages= Ainu is sometimes considered to be a Paleosiberian language, although it is not, strictly speaking, a language of Siberia. Small numbers of Ainu speakers currently live in southern Sakhalin, where it was the primary native language. Ainu was also spoken in the Kuril Islands and on Hokkaid≈ç, where a strong interest in its revival is taking place. Attempts have been made to relate it to many other language families, including Altaic, Austroasiatic, Austronesian, Nihali, Indo-European and Uralic. Alexander Vovin considers the Ruan-ruan language, spoken by the people of the Rouran Khaganate, to be an extinct non-Altaic language that is not related to any modern-day language, and is hence unrelated to Mongolic. He notes that Old Turkic had borrowed some words from an unknown non-Altaic language that may have been Ruan-ruan. Relationships Together with Japanese, these \\"poor relations\\" resist any easy or obvious linguistic classification, either with other groups or with each other. Languages within the Paleosiberian group are considered by some scholars, including Edward Vajda, to be related to the Na- Den√© and Eskimo‚ÄìAleut families of Alaska and northern Canada. This would back the majority consensus that North America's aboriginal peoples migrated from present-day Siberia and other regions of Asia when the two continents were joined during the last ice age. Ket, or more precisely Yeniseian as a whole, has been linked in a generally well-received proposal to the Na-Den√© languages of North America. Den√©‚ÄìYeniseian has been called \\"the first demonstration of a genealogical link between Old World and New World language families that meets the standards of traditional comparative-historical linguistics\\".Bernard Comrie (2008) \\"Why the Dene-Yeniseic Hypothesis is Exciting\\". Fairbanks and Anchorage, Alaska: Dene-Yeniseic Symposium. In the past, attempts have been made to relate it to Sino-Tibetan, North Caucasian, and Burushaski. Kim Bang- han proposed that placename glosses in the Samguk sagi reflect the original language of the Korean peninsula and a component in the formation of both Korean and Japanese. He proposed that this language was related to Nivkh. Juha Janhunen suggests the possibility that similar consonant stop systems in Koreanic and Nivkh may be due to ancient contact. p. 8. Two additional groups of languages predating the expansion of Turkic, Tungusic and Russian are known from Western Siberia, namely the Ob-Ugric and Samoyedic languages. They are however not considered Paleosiberian, as they are part of the established larger Uralic family. Yukaghir has often been suggested as a more distant relative of Uralic (see Uralic-Yukaghir languages), but this remains disputed.

History of Northeast Asia ","title":"Paleosiberian languages"},{"id":"243849","text":"In mathematics, projective geometry is the study of geometric properties that are invariant with respect to projective transformations. This means that, compared to elementary Euclidean geometry, projective geometry has a different setting, projective space, and a selective set of basic geometric concepts. The basic intuitions are that projective space has more points than Euclidean space, for a given dimension, and that geometric transformations are permitted that transform the extra points (called \\"points at infinity\\") to Euclidean points, and vice-versa. Properties meaningful for projective geometry are respected by this new idea of transformation, which is more radical in its effects than can be expressed by a transformation matrix and translations (the affine transformations). The first issue for geometers is what kind of geometry is adequate for a novel situation. It is not possible to refer to angles in projective geometry as it is in Euclidean geometry, because angle is an example of a concept not invariant with respect to projective transformations, as is seen in perspective drawing. One source for projective geometry was indeed the theory of perspective. Another difference from elementary geometry is the way in which parallel lines can be said to meet in a point at infinity, once the concept is translated into projective geometry's terms. Again this notion has an intuitive basis, such as railway tracks meeting at the horizon in a perspective drawing. See projective plane for the basics of projective geometry in two dimensions. While the ideas were available earlier, projective geometry was mainly a development of the 19th century. This included the theory of complex projective space, the coordinates used (homogeneous coordinates) being complex numbers. Several major types of more abstract mathematics (including invariant theory, the Italian school of algebraic geometry, and Felix Klein's Erlangen programme resulting in the study of the classical groups) were based on projective geometry. It was also a subject with many practitioners for its own sake, as synthetic geometry. Another topic that developed from axiomatic studies of projective geometry is finite geometry. The topic of projective geometry is itself now divided into many research subtopics, two examples of which are projective algebraic geometry (the study of projective varieties) and projective differential geometry (the study of differential invariants of the projective transformations).  Overview  The Fundamental Theory of Projective Geometry Projective geometry is an elementary non-metrical form of geometry, meaning that it is not based on a concept of distance. In two dimensions it begins with the study of configurations of points and lines. That there is indeed some geometric interest in this sparse setting was first established by Desargues and others in their exploration of the principles of perspective art.Ramanan 1997, p. 88 In higher dimensional spaces there are considered hyperplanes (that always meet), and other linear subspaces, which exhibit the principle of duality. The simplest illustration of duality is in the projective plane, where the statements \\"two distinct points determine a unique line\\" (i.e. the line through them) and \\"two distinct lines determine a unique point\\" (i.e. their point of intersection) show the same structure as propositions. Projective geometry can also be seen as a geometry of constructions with a straight-edge alone.Coxeter 2003, p. v Since projective geometry excludes compass constructions, there are no circles, no angles, no measurements, no parallels, and no concept of intermediacy.Coxeter 1969, p. 229 It was realised that the theorems that do apply to projective geometry are simpler statements. For example, the different conic sections are all equivalent in (complex) projective geometry, and some theorems about circles can be considered as special cases of these general theorems. During the early 19th century the work of Jean-Victor Poncelet, Lazare Carnot and others established projective geometry as an independent field of mathematics . Its rigorous foundations were addressed by Karl von Staudt and perfected by Italians Giuseppe Peano, Mario Pieri, Alessandro Padoa and Gino Fano during the late 19th century.Coxeter 2003, p. 14 Projective geometry, like affine and Euclidean geometry, can also be developed from the Erlangen program of Felix Klein; projective geometry is characterized by invariants under transformations of the projective group. After much work on the very large number of theorems in the subject, therefore, the basics of projective geometry became understood. The incidence structure and the cross-ratio are fundamental invariants under projective transformations. Projective geometry can be modeled by the affine plane (or affine space) plus a line (hyperplane) \\"at infinity\\" and then treating that line (or hyperplane) as \\"ordinary\\".Coxeter 1969, pp. 93, 261 An algebraic model for doing projective geometry in the style of analytic geometry is given by homogeneous coordinates.Coxeter 1969, pp. 234‚Äì238Coxeter 2003, pp. 111‚Äì132 On the other hand, axiomatic studies revealed the existence of non-Desarguesian planes, examples to show that the axioms of incidence can be modelled (in two dimensions only) by structures not accessible to reasoning through homogeneous coordinate systems. Growth measure and the polar vortices. Based on the work of Lawrence Edwards In a foundational sense, projective geometry and ordered geometry are elementary since they involve a minimum of axioms and either can be used as the foundation for affine and Euclidean geometry.Coxeter 1969, pp. 175‚Äì262Coxeter 2003, pp. 102‚Äì110 Projective geometry is not \\"ordered\\" and so it is a distinct foundation for geometry. History The first geometrical properties of a projective nature were discovered during the 3rd century by Pappus of Alexandria. Filippo Brunelleschi (1404‚Äì1472) started investigating the geometry of perspective during 1425 Coxeter 2003, p. 2 (see the history of perspective for a more thorough discussion of the work in the fine arts that motivated much of the development of projective geometry). Johannes Kepler (1571‚Äì1630) and G√©rard Desargues (1591‚Äì1661) independently developed the concept of the \\"point at infinity\\".Coxeter 2003, p. 3 Desargues developed an alternative way of constructing perspective drawings by generalizing the use of vanishing points to include the case when these are infinitely far away. He made Euclidean geometry, where parallel lines are truly parallel, into a special case of an all-encompassing geometric system. Desargues's study on conic sections drew the attention of 16-year-old Blaise Pascal and helped him formulate Pascal's theorem. The works of Gaspard Monge at the end of 18th and beginning of 19th century were important for the subsequent development of projective geometry. The work of Desargues was ignored until Michel Chasles chanced upon a handwritten copy during 1845. Meanwhile, Jean-Victor Poncelet had published the foundational treatise on projective geometry during 1822. Poncelet separated the projective properties of objects in individual class and establishing a relationship between metric and projective properties. The non-Euclidean geometries discovered soon thereafter were eventually demonstrated to have models, such as the Klein model of hyperbolic space, relating to projective geometry. In 1855 A. F. M√∂bius wrote an article about permutations, now called M√∂bius transformations, of generalised circles in the complex plane. These transformations represent projectivities of the complex projective line. In the study of lines in space, Julius Pl√ºcker used homogeneous coordinates in his description, and the set of lines was viewed on the Klein quadric, one of the early contributions of projective geometry to a new field called algebraic geometry, an offshoot of analytic geometry with projective ideas. Projective geometry was instrumental in the validation of speculations of Lobachevski and Bolyai concerning hyperbolic geometry by providing models for the hyperbolic plane:John Milnor (1982) Hyperbolic geometry: The first 150 years, Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society via Project Euclid for example, the Poincar√© disc model where generalised circles perpendicular to the unit circle correspond to \\"hyperbolic lines\\" (geodesics), and the \\"translations\\" of this model are described by M√∂bius transformations that map the unit disc to itself. The distance between points is given by a Cayley-Klein metric, known to be invariant under the translations since it depends on cross-ratio, a key projective invariant. The translations are described variously as isometries in metric space theory, as linear fractional transformations formally, and as projective linear transformations of the projective linear group, in this case SU(1, 1). The work of Poncelet, Jakob Steiner and others was not intended to extend analytic geometry. Techniques were supposed to be synthetic: in effect projective space as now understood was to be introduced axiomatically. As a result, reformulating early work in projective geometry so that it satisfies current standards of rigor can be somewhat difficult. Even in the case of the projective plane alone, the axiomatic approach can result in models not describable via linear algebra. This period in geometry was overtaken by research on the general algebraic curve by Clebsch, Riemann, Max Noether and others, which stretched existing techniques, and then by invariant theory. Towards the end of the century, the Italian school of algebraic geometry (Enriques, Segre, Severi) broke out of the traditional subject matter into an area demanding deeper techniques. During the later part of the 19th century, the detailed study of projective geometry became less fashionable, although the literature is voluminous. Some important work was done in enumerative geometry in particular, by Schubert, that is now considered as anticipating the theory of Chern classes, taken as representing the algebraic topology of Grassmannians. Paul Dirac studied projective geometry and used it as a basis for developing his concepts of quantum mechanics, although his published results were always in algebraic form. See a blog article referring to an article and a book on this subject, also to a talk Dirac gave to a general audience during 1972 in Boston about projective geometry, without specifics as to its application in his physics. Description Projective geometry is less restrictive than either Euclidean geometry or affine geometry. It is an intrinsically non-metrical geometry, meaning that facts are independent of any metric structure. Under the projective transformations, the incidence structure and the relation of projective harmonic conjugates are preserved. A projective range is the one-dimensional foundation. Projective geometry formalizes one of the central principles of perspective art: that parallel lines meet at infinity, and therefore are drawn that way. In essence, a projective geometry may be thought of as an extension of Euclidean geometry in which the \\"direction\\" of each line is subsumed within the line as an extra \\"point\\", and in which a \\"horizon\\" of directions corresponding to coplanar lines is regarded as a \\"line\\". Thus, two parallel lines meet on a horizon line by virtue of their incorporating the same direction. Idealized directions are referred to as points at infinity, while idealized horizons are referred to as lines at infinity. In turn, all these lines lie in the plane at infinity. However, infinity is a metric concept, so a purely projective geometry does not single out any points, lines or planes in this regard‚Äîthose at infinity are treated just like any others. Because a Euclidean geometry is contained within a projective geometry‚Äîwith projective geometry having a simpler foundation‚Äîgeneral results in Euclidean geometry may be derived in a more transparent manner, where separate but similar theorems of Euclidean geometry may be handled collectively within the framework of projective geometry. For example, parallel and nonparallel lines need not be treated as separate cases; rather an arbitrary projective plane is singled out as the ideal plane and located \\"at infinity\\" using homogeneous coordinates. Additional properties of fundamental importance include Desargues' Theorem and the Theorem of Pappus. In projective spaces of dimension 3 or greater there is a construction that allows one to prove Desargues' Theorem. But for dimension 2, it must be separately postulated. Using Desargues' Theorem, combined with the other axioms, it is possible to define the basic operations of arithmetic, geometrically. The resulting operations satisfy the axioms of a field ‚Äî except that the commutativity of multiplication requires Pappus's hexagon theorem. As a result, the points of each line are in one-to-one correspondence with a given field, , supplemented by an additional element, ‚àû, such that , , , , , , except that , , , , and remain undefined. Projective geometry also includes a full theory of conic sections, a subject also extensively developed in Euclidean geometry. There are advantages to being able to think of a hyperbola and an ellipse as distinguished only by the way the hyperbola lies across the line at infinity; and that a parabola is distinguished only by being tangent to the same line. The whole family of circles can be considered as conics passing through two given points on the line at infinity ‚Äî at the cost of requiring complex coordinates. Since coordinates are not \\"synthetic\\", one replaces them by fixing a line and two points on it, and considering the linear system of all conics passing through those points as the basic object of study. This method proved very attractive to talented geometers, and the topic was studied thoroughly. An example of this method is the multi-volume treatise by H. F. Baker. There are many projective geometries, which may be divided into discrete and continuous: a discrete geometry comprises a set of points, which may or may not be finite in number, while a continuous geometry has infinitely many points with no gaps in between. The only projective geometry of dimension 0 is a single point. A projective geometry of dimension 1 consists of a single line containing at least 3 points. The geometric construction of arithmetic operations cannot be performed in either of these cases. For dimension 2, there is a rich structure in virtue of the absence of Desargues' Theorem. The Fano plane is the projective plane with the fewest points and lines. According to Greenberg (1999) and others, the simplest 2-dimensional projective geometry is the Fano plane, which has 3 points on every line, with 7 points and 7 lines in all, having the following collinearities: * [ABC] * [ADE] * [AFG] * [BDG] * [BEF] * [CDF] * [CEG] with homogeneous coordinates , , , , , , , or, in affine coordinates, , , , , , and . The affine coordinates in a Desarguesian plane for the points designated to be the points at infinity (in this example: C, E and G) can be defined in several other ways. In standard notation, a finite projective geometry is written where: : is the projective (or geometric) dimension, and : is one less than the number of points on a line (called the order of the geometry). Thus, the example having only 7 points is written . The term \\"projective geometry\\" is used sometimes to indicate the generalised underlying abstract geometry, and sometimes to indicate a particular geometry of wide interest, such as the metric geometry of flat space which we analyse through the use of homogeneous coordinates, and in which Euclidean geometry may be embedded (hence its name, Extended Euclidean plane). The fundamental property that singles out all projective geometries is the elliptic incidence property that any two distinct lines and in the projective plane intersect at exactly one point . The special case in analytic geometry of parallel lines is subsumed in the smoother form of a line at infinity on which lies. The line at infinity is thus a line like any other in the theory: it is in no way special or distinguished. (In the later spirit of the Erlangen programme one could point to the way the group of transformations can move any line to the line at infinity). The parallel properties of elliptic, Euclidean and hyperbolic geometries contrast as follows: : Given a line and a point not on the line, ::; Elliptic : there exists no line through that does not meet ::; Euclidean : there exists exactly one line through that does not meet ::; Hyperbolic : there exists more than one line through that does not meet The parallel property of elliptic geometry is the key idea that leads to the principle of projective duality, possibly the most important property that all projective geometries have in common. Duality In 1825, Joseph Gergonne noted the principle of duality characterizing projective plane geometry: given any theorem or definition of that geometry, substituting point for line, lie on for pass through, collinear for concurrent, intersection for join, or vice versa, results in another theorem or valid definition, the \\"dual\\" of the first. Similarly in 3 dimensions, the duality relation holds between points and planes, allowing any theorem to be transformed by swapping point and plane, is contained by and contains. More generally, for projective spaces of dimension N, there is a duality between the subspaces of dimension R and dimension N‚àíR‚àí1. For N = 2, this specializes to the most commonly known form of duality‚Äîthat between points and lines. The duality principle was also discovered independently by Jean-Victor Poncelet. To establish duality only requires establishing theorems which are the dual versions of the axioms for the dimension in question. Thus, for 3-dimensional spaces, one needs to show that (1*) every point lies in 3 distinct planes, (2*) every two planes intersect in a unique line and a dual version of (3*) to the effect: if the intersection of plane P and Q is coplanar with the intersection of plane R and S, then so are the respective intersections of planes P and R, Q and S (assuming planes P and S are distinct from Q and R). In practice, the principle of duality allows us to set up a dual correspondence between two geometric constructions. The most famous of these is the polarity or reciprocity of two figures in a conic curve (in 2 dimensions) or a quadric surface (in 3 dimensions). A commonplace example is found in the reciprocation of a symmetrical polyhedron in a concentric sphere to obtain the dual polyhedron. Another example is Brianchon's theorem, the dual of the already mentioned Pascal's theorem, and one of whose proofs simply consists of applying the principle of duality to Pascal's. Here are comparative statements of these two theorems (in both cases within the framework of the projective plane): * Pascal: If all six vertices of a hexagon lie on a conic, then the intersections of its opposite sides (regarded as full lines, since in the projective plane there is no such thing as a \\"line segment\\") are three collinear points. The line joining them is then called the Pascal line of the hexagon. * Brianchon: If all six sides of a hexagon are tangent to a conic, then its diagonals (i.e. the lines joining opposite vertices) are three concurrent lines. Their point of intersection is then called the Brianchon point of the hexagon. : (If the conic degenerates into two straight lines, Pascal's becomes Pappus's theorem, which has no interesting dual, since the Brianchon point trivially becomes the two lines' intersection point.) Axioms of projective geometry Any given geometry may be deduced from an appropriate set of axioms. Projective geometries are characterised by the \\"elliptic parallel\\" axiom, that any two planes always meet in just one line, or in the plane, any two lines always meet in just one point. In other words, there are no such things as parallel lines or planes in projective geometry. Many alternative sets of axioms for projective geometry have been proposed (see for example Coxeter 2003, Hilbert & Cohn-Vossen 1999, Greenberg 1980). =Whitehead's axioms= These axioms are based on Whitehead, \\"The Axioms of Projective Geometry\\". There are two types, points and lines, and one \\"incidence\\" relation between points and lines. The three axioms are: * G1: Every line contains at least 3 points * G2: Every two distinct points, A and B, lie on a unique line, AB. * G3: If lines AB and CD intersect, then so do lines AC and BD (where it is assumed that A and D are distinct from B and C). The reason each line is assumed to contain at least 3 points is to eliminate some degenerate cases. The spaces satisfying these three axioms either have at most one line, or are projective spaces of some dimension over a division ring, or are non-Desarguesian planes. =Additional axioms= One can add further axioms restricting the dimension or the coordinate ring. For example, Coxeter's Projective Geometry,Coxeter 2003, pp. 14‚Äì15 references VeblenVeblen 1966, pp. 16, 18, 24, 45 in the three axioms above, together with a further 5 axioms that make the dimension 3 and the coordinate ring a commutative field of characteristic not 2\\\\. =Axioms using a ternary relation= One can pursue axiomatization by postulating a ternary relation, [ABC] to denote when three points (not all necessarily distinct) are collinear. An axiomatization may be written down in terms of this relation as well: * C0: [ABA] * C1: If A and B are two points such that [ABC] and [ABD] then [BDC] * C2: If A and B are two points then there is a third point C such that [ABC] * C3: If A and C are two points, B and D also, with [BCE], [ADE] but not [ABE] then there is a point F such that [ACF] and [BDF]. For two different points, A and B, the line AB is defined as consisting of all points C for which [ABC]. The axioms C0 and C1 then provide a formalization of G2; C2 for G1 and C3 for G3. The concept of line generalizes to planes and higher- dimensional subspaces. A subspace, AB‚Ä¶XY may thus be recursively defined in terms of the subspace AB‚Ä¶X as that containing all the points of all lines YZ, as Z ranges over AB‚Ä¶X. Collinearity then generalizes to the relation of \\"independence\\". A set {A, B, ‚Ä¶, Z} of points is independent, [AB‚Ä¶Z] if {A, B, ‚Ä¶, Z} is a minimal generating subset for the subspace AB‚Ä¶Z. The projective axioms may be supplemented by further axioms postulating limits on the dimension of the space. The minimum dimension is determined by the existence of an independent set of the required size. For the lowest dimensions, the relevant conditions may be stated in equivalent form as follows. A projective space is of: * (L1) at least dimension 0 if it has at least 1 point, * (L2) at least dimension 1 if it has at least 2 distinct points (and therefore a line), * (L3) at least dimension 2 if it has at least 3 non-collinear points (or two lines, or a line and a point not on the line), * (L4) at least dimension 3 if it has at least 4 non-coplanar points. The maximum dimension may also be determined in a similar fashion. For the lowest dimensions, they take on the following forms. A projective space is of: * (M1) at most dimension 0 if it has no more than 1 point, * (M2) at most dimension 1 if it has no more than 1 line, * (M3) at most dimension 2 if it has no more than 1 plane, and so on. It is a general theorem (a consequence of axiom (3)) that all coplanar lines intersect‚Äîthe very principle Projective Geometry was originally intended to embody. Therefore, property (M3) may be equivalently stated that all lines intersect one another. It is generally assumed that projective spaces are of at least dimension 2. In some cases, if the focus is on projective planes, a variant of M3 may be postulated. The axioms of (Eves 1997: 111), for instance, include (1), (2), (L3) and (M3). Axiom (3) becomes vacuously true under (M3) and is therefore not needed in this context. =Axioms for projective planes= In incidence geometry, most authors, , , , , , , and among the references given. give a treatment that embraces the Fano plane PG(2, 2) as the smallest finite projective plane. An axiom system that achieves this is as follows: * (P1) Any two distinct points lie on a unique line. * (P2) Any two distinct lines meet in a unique point. * (P3) There exist at least four points of which no three are collinear. Coxeter's Introduction to GeometryCoxeter 1969, pp. 229‚Äì234 gives a list of five axioms for a more restrictive concept of a projective plane attributed to Bachmann, adding Pappus's theorem to the list of axioms above (which eliminates non-Desarguesian planes) and excluding projective planes over fields of characteristic 2 (those that don't satisfy Fano's axiom). The restricted planes given in this manner more closely resemble the real projective plane. Perspectivity and projectivity Given three non-collinear points, there are three lines connecting them, but with four points, no three collinear, there are six connecting lines and three additional \\"diagonal points\\" determined by their intersections. The science of projective geometry captures this surplus determined by four points through a quaternary relation and the projectivities which preserve the complete quadrangle configuration. An harmonic quadruple of points on a line occurs when there is a complete quadrangle two of whose diagonal points are in the first and third position of the quadruple, and the other two positions are points on the lines joining two quadrangle points through the third diagonal point.Halsted, pp. 15,16 A spacial perspectivity of a projective configuration in one plane yields such a configuration in another, and this applies to the configuration of the complete quadrangle. Thus harmonic quadruples are preserved by perspectivity. If one perspectivity follows another the configurations follow along. The composition of two perspectivities is no longer a perspectivity, but a projectivity. While corresponding points of a perspectivity all converge at a point, this convergence is not true for a projectivity that is not a perspectivity. In projective geometry the intersection of lines formed by corresponding points of a projectivity in a plane are of particular interest. The set of such intersections is called a projective conic, and in acknowlegement of the work of Jakob Steiner, it is referred to as a Steiner conic. Suppose a projectivity is formed by two perspectivities centered on points A and B, relating x to X by an intermediary p: :x \\\\ \\\\overset{A}{\\\\doublebarwedge}\\\\ p \\\\ \\\\overset{B}{\\\\doublebarwedge} \\\\ X. The projectivity is then x \\\\ \\\\barwedge \\\\ X . Then given the projectivity \\\\barwedge the induced conic is :C(\\\\barwedge) \\\\ = \\\\ \\\\bigcup\\\\\\\\{xX \\\\cdot yY : x \\\\barwedge X \\\\ \\\\ \\\\land \\\\ \\\\ y \\\\barwedge Y \\\\\\\\} . Given a conic C and a point P not on it, two distinct secant lines through P intersect C in four points. These four points determine a quadrangle of which P is a diagonal point. The line through the other two diagonal points is called the polar of P and P is the pole of this line.Halsted, p. 25 Alternatively, the polar line of P is the set of projective harmonic conjugates of P on a variable secant line passing through P and C.

Photographed on June 18, 1941. John Trumbull's Surrender of General Burgoyne. Prescott stands right of center wearing all brown, just behind Captain Morgan in white William Prescott (February 20, 1726 ‚Äì October 13, 1795) was an American colonel in the Revolutionary War who commanded the patriot forces in the Battle of Bunker Hill. Prescott is known for his order to his soldiers, \\"Do not fire until you see the whites of their eyes\\", such that the rebel troops may shoot at the enemy at shorter ranges, and therefore more accurately and lethally, and so conserve their limited stocks of ammunition. It is debated whether Prescott or someone earlier coined this memorable saying. Life Prescott was born in Groton, Massachusetts, when East Pepperell was considered Groton, to Benjamin Prescott (1696‚Äì1738) and Abigail Oliver Prescott (1697‚Äì1765). He married Abigail Hale (1733‚Äì1821) on April 13, 1758, and they had one child, who is named William Prescott Jr. William Prescott owned a house in Pepperell, Massachusetts, on Prescott Street. Pepperell was then a frontier town bordering upon Hollis N.H. In fact, the Indians long continued to be his neighbors, so that there when it was considered unsafe to go into the field to their daily labor without their rifles. Col. Prescott held his lands as his son, Hon. Wm. Prescott, late of Boston, and his grandson Wm. H. Prescott, the historian, continued to hold them, under the original Indian title. Prescott served in the provincial militia in King George's War where he served in the 1745 Siege of Louisbourg under William Pepperrell. He may have played a role in the naming of the town of Pepperell, Massachusetts, after his commander when it was separated from Groton in 1753. Col. Prescott was a lieutenant in the Provincial troops which were sent to remove the neutral French from Nova Scotia in 1755. After his return he married Miss Hale, as above, and was promoted to the office of captain. In 1755, when the French and Indian War widened, he saw action at the Battle of Fort Beausejour. He turned down an offer to join the British Army for his service in that war. =American Revolutionary War= In 1774 he was appointed colonel of a regiment of ‚Äúminute men,‚Äù enrolled in Pepperell and vicinity. On receiving intelligence of the ‚Äúregulars‚Äô‚Äù (British) attack on Lexington on the memorable 19th of April, 1775, the alarm that was raised, that British troops were marching on Concord reached Pepperell about 10 a.m. on April 19. Prescott immediately gave order for the company in Pepperell and the company in Hollis, to march to Groton and thence to the scene of action, but arriving there before the Groton Companies were ready, they, after a short halt, proceeded on their way in advance of the Groton companies. Col. Prescott hastened on, with as many of his regiment as he could collect, to Concord and thence to Cambridge, but did not overtake the retreating British troops. The companies arrived too late to participate in the day's battles, but they became part of the small army that laid siege to Boston afterward. He and most of his men enlisted for eight months, the period of the first enlistment. When the American military commanders were alerted to British plans to capture undefended high ground at Dorchester Heights and Charlestown, Prescott was chosen to lead 1,200 men onto the Charlestown peninsula and erect defenses on Bunker Hill. The actual defenses were built on Breeds Hill, as it was lower and closer to the harbor. \\"On the 16th of June, 1775, Gen. Artemus Ward, the commander-in-chief, issued an order for placing three Massachusetts regiments (Col. Prescott's, Col. Frye's and Col. Bridge's) and one hundred and twenty men from a Connecticut regiment (under the brave command of Thomas Knowlton), about one thousand in all, all under the command of Col. Prescott, directing them to proceed to Bunker Hill and there erect a fortification. The detachment started from Cambridge Common at dark, who proceeded silently to Bunker Hill, where the troops, at about 1 1 o'clock, P. M., commenced building the intrenchments as laid out by Captain Richard Gridley. ‚ÄúThe breast work or redoubt was only constructed of such earth as the party had thrown up after the middle of the night and was not more than breast high to a man of medium height. Colonel Prescott being a very tall man, six feet and two or three inches in height, his head and shoulders and a considerable portion of his body must have been exposed during the whole of the engagement. He wore a three-cornered coked hat and a ban-yan or calico coat. After one of his men was killed by cannon ball, Prescott, perceiving that this had made some of the soldier‚Äôs sick at heart, mounted tile para-pet and walked leisurely around it, cheering his soldiers by approbation and humor. His clothing was repeatedly spattered with the blood and the brains of the killed and wounded. The writer (Dr. O. Prescott] Jr.) saw the waistcoat and the ban-yan coat after the engagement, and they had several holes pierced by the bayonets of the British in their attempts at his life.‚Äù The Americans, although raw troops, fought with the bravery and obstinacy of veterans, until their ammunition was exhausted. Col. Prescott was always confident that he could have maintained his position, even with the handful of men under him, if he had been supplied with ammunition. The next day, his troops, who were tired from working to construct a redoubt and other defensive works, and had only limited ammunition, formed the centerpiece of the American defenses when the British attacked the position. The British began firing from the ship Lively at 4 a.m. and attacked at 3 p.m. Prescott ordered the Connecticut men under Captain Knowlton to defend the left flank, where they used a crude dirt wall as a breastwork, and topped it with fence rails and hay. They also constructed three small v-shaped trenches between this dirt wall and Prescott's breastwork. Troops that arrived to reinforce this flank position included about 200 men from the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire regiments, under Colonels John Stark and James Reed] In spirited battle, Prescott's men twice threw back British assaults on the redoubt. When the British made a third attempt, his men were almost out of ammunition; after an initial volley, he ordered a retreat from the redoubt. He was one of the last men to leave the redoubt, parrying bayonet thrusts with his ceremonial saber. The men on the left flank played a key part in the cover of the retreat. Prescott told General Artemas Ward the Commander-in-Chief, that he would retake the place that night or perish in the attempt, if he would give him three regiments, with bayonets and sufficient ammunition. But from prudential reasons it was declined.\\" While the British successfully captured Bunker Hill, the poorly organized colonial forces inflicted significant casualties, and the British were unable to capitalize their victory. They lost 50 percent of the force (killed or wounded) commanded by General Howe. Prescott is widely seen as having played a key role in the battle, keeping the relatively poorly trained militia under his command well-disciplined. As it was, however, the British were left in possession of the field, for they had carried the position at the point of the bayonet and technically the day was theirs. Among the many Americans who distinguished themselves at Bunker Hill the names of Prescott, Putnam and Warren stand out most clearly. While General Putnam was on the scene at Bunker Hill by some writers he was not in the redoubt at Breeds Hill at any time during the action, but was attempting to direct affairs, to unit commanders who often misunderstood or disobeyed orders from that position. Joseph Warren, a Massachusetts politician and member of the colony's Committee of safety (American Revolution), volunteered to serve under Colonel William Prescott in the defense of the redoubt as a private and wanted to be close to the battle. It is during the retreat from the redoubt on Breeds Hill that Joseph Warren was killed. When the Second Continental Congress established the Continental Army it sent George Washington to take command of the forces besieging Boston. Prescott received a colonel's commission, and his unit became the 7th Continental Regiment. The regiment saw service in the 1776 defense of New York. While he appears to have given up command of the regiment after that campaign, he apparently participated in some capacity in the 1777 Saratoga campaign, for he is depicted in the painting of the Surrender of General Burgoyne at Saratoga by John Trumbull,Surrender of General Burgoyne which hangs in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. In his person he was tall, with a large and muscular frame, but not corpulent, his features strong and indicative of intelligence. He was courteous and benevolent, and possessed a strong mind. Not having had the advantages of an early education he was most emphatically a self-made man. His departure from military service may have been due to injuries sustained in an accident on his farm. =Later life= Col. Prescott continued in the service until the end of 1776. He was stationed at Governor's Island, N. Y., until the Americans were obliged to retire from the city. In the autumn of 1777, he went as a volunteer, to assist in the capture of the army under General Burgoyne, which was his last military service. He was elected a member of the Provincial Congress held at Salem. After his retirement from the army he served the town as town clerk, selectman, representative to the General Court for three years, and was an acting magistrate for the remainder of his life. When Shay's rebellion broke out, he hastened to Concord, and assisted in protecting the courts of justice and of preserving law and order. Prescott served in the Massachusetts General Court in later years. He also served in the militia called out in 1786 to suppress Shays' Rebellion. His brother Oliver Prescott was said to be influential in the suppression of that outbreak. \\" \\" The following anecdote the writer had from Colonel Prescott himself: While stationed with his regiment near New York in 1776, the out guards brought in a British deserter. As they approached the camp the deserter observed to the guards, ' that officer yonder is Colonel Prescott.' The guard informed the Colonel of the fact. ' How come you to know me ^ ' inquired Colonel Prescott. ' I saw you on Bunker Hill,' replied the soldier, 'and recollected you immediately.' ' Why did you not kill me at that time? ' asked Colonel Prescott. ' I tried my best,' said the soldier, ' I took deliberate aim at you more than once when I thought it impossible for you to escape. I also palsied at you several times with my bayonet when you were as near as I could have wished, and after several of us had taken possession of your works.' ' You are a brave fellow,' said Colonel Prescott, ' come into my tent and I will treat you.' \\" \\" While on the retreat from the scene of conflict Colonel Prescott came to a house on Charlestown street, near the ' neck,' where were three or four men who had just prepared a bowl of punch, and which they presented to Colonel Prescott before having tasted it. This, to a man suffering with fatigue and parched with thirst, was a most gratifying and acceptable offering. Prescott took the bowl, but before he had time to partake of its contents a cannon ball passed through the house, upon which the men immediately fled, leaving Colonel Prescott to drain the bowl by himself and at his leisure.\\" Dr. O. Prescott further relates that Colonel Prescott was a true patriot. As a neighbor, kind and benevolent, and a peacemaker in to his vain, and was universally loved and respected. William died of dropsy of the chest, in Pepperell and was buried with military honors suitable to his rank, life and character at Walton Cemetery. He fell at a ripe old age, full of honors, and highly esteemed and respected. Military Hall of Honor His widow died Oct. 21, 1821, aged 88 years. Legacy Col. Prescott's statue at Bunker Hill in Charlestown Prescott's likeness was made into a statue for a memorial for the Battle of Bunker Hill in Charlestown, Massachusetts and was dedicated in 1881. The former town of Prescott, Massachusetts, was named in his honor. The town was disincorporated in 1938 as part of the building of the Quabbin Reservoir, and the land now makes up Prescott Peninsula, which divides the main branches of the reservoir. Colonel Prescott's famous order, \\"Do not fire until you see the whites of their eyes,\\" is a significant part of the Schoolhouse Rock video and song, \\"The Shot Heard round the World.\\" In 1856, the Prescott School, named in his honor, was built on the northeasterly portion of the Bunker Hill Burying Ground in Charlestown, Massachusetts. The Prescott School later merged with the Warren School to form the Warren-Prescott School.Charlestown Historical Society: Full Historic Timeline Prescott's house is located in Pepperell, Massachusetts.

Chinese banknotes contain several scripts in addition to Chinese script. These are: * Mongol * Tibetan * Arabic (for Uyghur) * Latin (for Zhuang) Other writing system for Chinese languages in China include: * N√ºshu script Ten nationalities who never had a written system have, under the PRC's encouragement, developed phonetic alphabets. According to a government white paper published in early 2005, \\"by the end of 2003, 22 ethnic minorities in China used 28 written languages.\\" Language policy The Chinese language policy in mainland China is heavily influenced by the Soviet nationalities policy and officially encourages the development of standard spoken and written languages for each of the nationalities of China. However, in this schema, Han Chinese are considered a single nationality and the official policy of the People's Republic of China (PRC) treats the different varieties of Chinese differently from the different national languages, even though their differences are as significant as those between the various Romance languages of Europe. While official policies in mainland China encourage the development and use of different orthographies for the national languages and their use in educational and academic settings, realistically speaking it would seem that, as elsewhere in the world, the outlook for minority languages perceived as inferior is grim.The prospects for the long-term survival of Non- Han minority languages in the south of China The Tibetan Government-in-Exile argue that social pressures and political efforts result in a policy of sinicization and feels that Beijing should promote the Tibetan language more. Because many languages exist in China, they also have problems regarding diglossia. Recently, in terms of Fishman's typology of the relationships between bilingualism and diglossia and his taxonomy of diglossia (Fishman 1978, 1980) in China: more and more minority communities have been evolving from \\"diglossia without bilingualism\\" to \\"bilingualism without diglossia.\\" This could be an implication of mainland China's power expanding.Minglang Zhou, Multilingualism in China the politics of Writing reforms for minority languages 1949-2002 (2003) It was reported by The New York Times on 31 August 2020 that in the summer 2020, the Chinese government announced an education policy, which called for Chinese to gradually replace Mongolian as the language of instruction in three subjects, including language and literature, politics, and history, in elementary and middle schools around the Inner Mongolia region, and then thousands of ethnic Mongolians in northern China gathered to protested the policy. Study of foreign languages English has been the most widely-taught foreign language in China, as it is a required subject for students attending university. Other languages that have gained some degree of prevalence or interest are Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian. During the 1950s and 1960s, Russian had some social status among elites in mainland China as the international language of socialism. In the late 1960s, English replaced the position of Russian to become the most studied foreign language in China. After the Reform and Opening-up policy in 1988, English was taught in public schools starting in the third year of primary school. Russian, French, and German language classes have been made widely available in universities and colleges. In Northeast China, there are many bilingual schools (Mandarin-Japanese; Mandarin-Korean; Mandarin-Russian), in these schools, students learn languages other than English. The Economist, issue April 12, 2006, reported that up to one fifth of the population was learning English. Gordon Brown, the former British Prime Minister, estimated that the total English-speaking population in China would outnumber the native speakers in the rest of the world in two decades. There have been a growing number of students studying Arabic, due to reasons of cultural interest and belief in better job opportunities. The language is also widely studied amongst the Hui people. In the past, literary Arabic education was promoted in Islamic schools by the Kuomintang when it ruled mainland China. There have also been a growing number of students choosing to learn Urdu, due to interest in Pakistani culture, close ties between the respective nations, and job opportunities provided by the CPEC. Interest in Portuguese and Spanish have increased greatly, due in part to Chinese investment in Latin America as well as in African nations such as Angola, Mozambique, and Cape Verde. Portuguese is also one of the official languages in Macau, although its use had stagnated since the nation's transfer from Portugal to the PRC. It was estimated in 2016 that 2.3% of Macau's locals spoke the language, although with government backing since then, interest in it has increased. =Use of English= In China, English is used as a lingua franca in several fields, especially for business settings,Wang, Wenpu and Lin Wei (Chengdu Technological University). \\"Chinese English in as lingua franca in global business setting: A case study of on going emails of a foreign company in China.\\" ICITCE 2015.

Better known by his noble title Lord Cornbury, he was propelled into the forefront of English politics when he and part of his army defected from the Catholic King James II to support the newly arrived Protestant contender, William III of Orange. These actions were part of the beginning of the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Cornbury's choice to support his cousin Anne instead of William after the rebellion cost him his military commission. However, Cornbury's support of King William's reign eventually earned him the governorship of the provinces of New York and New Jersey; he served between 1701 and 1708. As a High Tory governor, his primary mission was to protect the colonies during the War of the Spanish Succession (known in the Americas as Queen Anne's War, or the 2nd French and Indian War; 1701 ‚Äì 1714). His administration successfully prevented French incursions into the middle colonies. However, he became mired in the region's many factional conflicts and accrued powerful political enemies such as Lewis Morris, who would go on to become Governor of New Jersey in 1738. By 1708, war-weariness led to a shift in the political tide in Great Britain. Governor Cornbury was recalled from the colonies but was soon after installed as a member of Queen Anne's privy council. Lord Cornbury's fortunes changed again when George I was crowned King of Great Britain on 1 August 1714. Out of favour, Lord Cornbury died in Chelsea, London on 31 March 1723. Lord Cornbury's conduct as governor has been generally remembered as scandalous. He was accused by his political enemies of being a cross-dresser, a moral profligate, and wildly corrupt. Few contemporary accounts exist of his conduct; and modern writers disagree as to whether or not Cornbury was actually a cross-dresser, or if Cornbury was possibly transgender. Early life The Honourable Edward Hyde, was born the only child of Henry, Viscount Cornbury & 2nd Earl of Clarendon (1638‚Äì1709) and Theodosia Capell (1640‚Äì1661), daughter of Arthur Capell, 1st Baron Capell of Hadham, and sister of Arthur Capell. Henry and Theodosia gave birth to Edward eleven months into their marriage. Only three months after Edward's birth, in March 1662, his mother Theodosia died of smallpox.Bonomi 1998, p. 31 Hyde's parents: Henry Hyde, Viscount Cornbury, later 2nd Earl of Clarendon (1688‚Äì1709) and his wife, Theodosia Capel, Viscountess Cornbury, by Peter Lely The Hyde family had close ties to the monarchy: Edward's grandfather, also named Edward, was the 1st Earl of Clarendon (1609‚Äì1674). He was born a commoner but became an important advisor to King Charles I (after 1641) and to Charles II (after 1651). He was best known for negotiating the Restoration of the English Monarchy in 1660 through a series of provisions known as the Clarendon Code. The same year Charles II regained the throne, Clarendon's daughter, Anne Hyde (1637‚Äì1671), married the new king's younger brother & heir, James, Duke of York. Meanwhile, Clarendon's eldest son, Henry, married into the Capells of Hadham, one of the richest families in England. Edward's aunt Anne, Duchess of York was the mother of two English Queens, Mary II and Anne.Bonomi 1998, p. 31 At age 13, Edward matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford on 23 January 1675. Only a year earlier he had inherited the title Viscount Cornbury when his father succeeded as 2nd Earl of Clarendon. Oxford was followed by three years at l'Academie de Calvin in Geneva.Bonomi 1998, p. 32 Military service After graduation, Lord Cornbury joined the elite Royal Regiment of Dragoons under the command of John Churchill, the future Duke of Marlborough. He became lieutenant colonel in 1683. He was stationed in Vienna, Austria by the beginning of 1685, protecting the city from the Ottoman Empire.Bonomi, p. 33 Cornbury first rose to prominence later that year, due to a struggle for the throne set in motion by King Charles II's death on 6 February 1685. James II was the legitimate heir, but he was a staunch Catholic. His nephew, James Fitzroy, the Duke of Monmouth, was illegitimate but a Protestant. On 11 June 1685, Monmouth landed in England hoping to gather popular support for his claim to the throne, triggering the Monmouth Rebellion.Bonomi, pp. 33-34 In response, King James II appointed John Churchill as second in command of the Royalist armies, while Lord Cornbury was promoted to command the Royal Dragoons. The rebellion was quickly crushed, with the Royal Dragoons playing a prominent role.Bonomi 1998, p. 33 As a reward for his service, Cornbury was given a seat in the Loyal Parliament of 1685.See Wiltshire County section of The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1660‚Äì1690, ed. B. D. Henning, (1983) and 1690‚Äì1715, ed. D. Hayton, E. Cruickshanks, S. Handley, 2002 (Found at http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/ ) These accounts detail the political manoeuvring that led to Cornbury's election. He continued to distinguish himself, and was a member of parliament for Wiltshire until 1695, and for Christchurch from 1695 until 1701. He earnt the role of Master of the Horse to the King of Denmark in 1685. =Glorious Revolution= Cornbury played a crucial role in the Glorious Rebellion, becoming the first English officer to defect to the invading William III of Orange. The rebellion originated on 18 June 1688, when prominent English nobles (the \\"Immortal Seven\\") sent a letter to William III of Orange requesting his intervention in English politics on the Protestant side. In response, William arrived in Brixham, in southwest England on 5 November with over 450 ships, 15,000‚Äì18,000 men, and 3,660 cavalry.See University of Nottingham's map of Wiliam's invasion route at: https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/manuscriptsandspecialcollections/documents/elearning/conflict/williamoforangeitinerary- illustration5.pdf Cornbury's Dragoons was the first royalist unit to make contact with the invasion force ‚Äì without engaging. A small skirmish was fought at Sherborne on 20 November, but shortly thereafter Lord Cornbury defected to William's side, bringing many of his dragoons with him.Bonomi 1998, pp 38-39; see also Stone 1892, pp. 55‚Äì56. Four days later on 24 November Cornbury's mentor, Lord Churchill, also switched sides. Though a relatively small number of Cornbury's men defected with him, accounts range from a low of 27 to a high of 100, the effect of Cornbury and Churchill's actions were devastating to Loyalist morale, and rumours spread that the entirety of their regiments had defected with them. His father despaired at hearing his son was a rebel, but would eventually help negotiate between James and William.Bonomi, p. 39 By late December James had disbanded his army and fled to France. With James gone, Parliament debated whether William would rule as King in his own right, or as Queen Mary's consort. Lord Cornbury argued for placing his cousin Anne next in succession after Mary, bypassing William. In the end, Parliament favoured William, who viewed Cornbury's support of Anne as disloyal, and reneged on his battlefield vow that he would never forget Cornbury's service. He punished Cornbury by dismissing him from his regiment on 17 July 1689, and from his ceremonial post as Master of Horse in May 1690.Bonomi, pp. 40-42 = Post Revolution = Cornbury now found himself and his family without income and in increasing debt. As a noble, he could not simply get a job, he would need to find income through royal or political means. He struggled to get by from 1690 through 1698. However, he continued to represent parliament, and his political support of William paid off in multiple ways. In 1698, William agreed to pay ¬£10 a week to Cornbury, easing his financial burdens. In the spring of 1701, William rewarded Cornbury's continued support and service and appointed Cornbury as Governor of New York.Bonomi, pp. 43-45 William died before Cornbury become governor, and the crown went to Queen Mary II's younger sister Anne. Cornbury's support of her for the throne in the Glorious Revolution, combined with being her first cousin, served Cornbury well. Anne continued to support Cornbury, and would reward him generously on his return from the governorship.Bonomi, pp. 51-54 Governor of New York and New Jersey New York 1700 Lord Cornbury arrived in New York on 3 May 1702, to begin his governorship and was graciously welcomed by the local aristocracy. Hyde assumed the governorship amidst Queen Anne's War, which threatened the colonies.Ross 1988, p. 3 When Lord Cornbury was appointed governor, he was also made \\"captain-general of all forces by sea and land\\" for all colonies north of Virginia.Bonomi 1998, pp 62‚Äì64 Upon arrival, the new governor inspected the colony's ring of defensive forts and found them in total disrepair, with the key defensive fort at Albany essentially unusable.William Glidden, The English Stone Fortress: Fort Frederick, Lake Champlain Weekly (17 September 2003) Quoted at: http://dmna.ny.gov/forts/fortsE_L/frederickFort.htmSee Reynolds (1906) page 157 for the previous governor's (Earl of Bellomont) report of the conditions at Albany in 1700.Stone (1892) pp. 60‚Äì61Cliff Lamere, Fort Albany & Fort Frederick at Albany NY at: http://www.genealogy.clifflamere.com/Aid/History/FortFrederick-Albany- working.htm In August 1703, the newly formed Province of New Jersey was added to Cornbury's responsibilities by Queen Anne.Stellhorn, Paul A., and Birkner, Michael J. \\"Edward Hyde, Viscount Cornbury\\" in The Governors of New Jersey 1664‚Äì1974: Biographical Essays. (Trenton, New Jersey: New Jersey Historical Commission, 1982), 36‚Äì38. The governor immediately dismissed Colonel Wolfgang William R√∂mer, the imperial engineer who had responsibility for maintaining the forts. He then assumed direct oversight over a vast project to construct a large fortress ringed with stone ramparts (later named Fort Frederick).Bonomi 1998, p. 64 In August 1702, Governor Cornbury toured the site with representatives of the Iroquois Five Nations. In a report to the Lords of Trade dated 18 June 1703, Imperial Inspector Colonel Robert Quary reported on the construction of the forts: Invasion by sea was the other threat to New York. The approaches to New York harbour were fortified by a rebuilt Fort William Henry on the tip of Manhattan Island, in addition to a line of forts and stockades on both banks of the Hudson RiverKnown at the time as the North River. as far as the East River. A breastwork with cannon lined the island's riverbanks. Some of the cannon had been commandeered from ships in the harbuor.Stone 1892, p. 69; Booth 1859, pp. 276‚Äì278 Fears of attack from the sea were realised on 26 July 1706, when the French 16-gun brig Queen Anne suddenly appeared off Sandy Hook at the harbour entrance. Rumours quickly spread that 10 more ships were on the way from the Virginia Capes. The resulting panic was magnified by the fact that fortifications at the Verrazano narrows were as yet incomplete.Bonomi 1998, p. 83:The plan was to repair and fortify blockhouses originally built by the Dutch ‚Äì One on Signal Hill on Staten Island (built 1653, later known as Flagstaff Fort [1776] and Fort Tompkins [1806]). Another blockhouse stood in the village of New Utrecht on the Brooklyn side (built 1657, later Fort Hamilton [1826]). England was supposed to supply cannon, but they never arrived. The local populace rushed to the site and quickly dug defensive embankments.Stone 1892, p. 70 The French ship sailed away without attacking, and the approaching fleet turned out to be 10 ships that had been captured from the French.Stone 1892, p. 70‚Äì71 In 1703, the New York Assembly had assigned Mayor William PeartreeBooth 1859, p. 281: Peartree had been appointed mayor because of his former experience as a privateer to raise ¬£1500 to complete the project.Bonomi 1998, pp. 82-85: The Assembly's subsequent inquiry discovered that tax collectors only raised ¬£398 of the total. The money had been placed in the hands of the colonial receiver of revenues. Despite these findings, historians have continued to cite the charge as proof of Cornbury's incompetence. Compare Stone 1892, p. 70 & p. 73. See also, Booth 1859, pp. 276‚Äì281 However, blame was quickly shifted to Governor Cornbury, with accusations of embezzlement. The charge prompted the New York Assembly to cut off funding to the governor and manage the colonial budget directly.Stone 1892, p. 73: In England, the Parliament House of Commons has the \\"power of the purse\\" ‚Äì sole control over taxation and funding of major undertakings. A Charter of Liberties had been enacted by the New York Assembly in 1683 but they were annulled by Queen Mary II in 1691. See also Booth 1859, pp. 207‚Äì208, p. 240) No French or native incursions into New York Colony occurred throughout the 11-year war.Stone 1892, pp. 65‚Äì66 =Religious issues and politics= Despite an Anglican minority, Governor Cornbury was determined to secure the Church of England as the state religion in the colonies. He was shocked to discover that public funds had been used to build and maintain a Presbyterian church in the village of Jamaica on Long Island. On 4 July 1704, the church, parsonage, and associated buildings were confiscated for use by the Anglican Church.Stone 1892, p. 65 Cornbury's most notorious religious scandal involved Reverend Francis Makemie (1658‚Äì1708), the \\"Father of American Presbyterianism\\". During 1683‚Äì1706, the minister established the first Presbyterian congregations in America, primarily in Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. While passing through New York in January 1707, Reverend Makemie led a worship service in a private home. During the service, he performed an infant baptism. In doing so, he violated several English laws prohibiting the practice of \\"dissenter\\" religions.Wilson 1892, p. 81: Other ministers had warned Makemie about meeting the legal requirements, so the subject of Makemie's sermon was \\"We ought to obey God, rather than Men.\\" (Acts 5:29) It was a time of increased tension: the Acts of Union (1706 & 1707) had just united England and Scotland under a single government. Most Scots vehemently disapproved of the change, Presbyterians in particular. Rumours circulated about dissenter groups plotting subversion, riot or revolution. High Tories like Cornbury rallied to the cry of \\"The Church in Danger\\" ‚Äì the supposed threat posed by Whigs and Nonconformists. Governor Cornbury duly arrested the visiting minister for preaching without a license.Cornbury accused Makemie of being a \\"Disturber of Governments\\". See David Hall, Francis Makemie and Freedom of Speech in The Aquila Report 25 January 2015; and Wilson 1892, p. 82. Seven weeks later Makemie faced trial by the Supreme Court of New York and was acquitted.The decision has been hailed as a landmark for American religious freedom. See Francis Makemie, Presbyterian Pioneer, by Kirk Mariner. http://francismakemiesociety.org/files/Download/Francis%20Makemie%20-%20Presbyterian%20Pioneer%20by%20Kirk%20Mariner.pdfMakemie's published account of the event can be found in Rev.

During this period Cornbury found himself at odds with the Lewis Morris (1671‚Äì1746), then a member of the New Jersey Provincial Council and eventual rival of Cornbury. Cornbury responded by suspending Morris from the upper house in September 1704. Morris apologised to the governor and was reinstated, but in December 1704 Cornbury suspended him again.The Path to Freedom: The Struggle for Self-Government in Colonial New Jersey 1703‚Äì1776; Donald L. Kemmerer; Princeton University Press; Princeton, 1940; p. 358 Meanwhile, the Anglican Church prospered. Trinity Church, the first meetinghouse in New York, had opened for worship on 3 Mar 1698. In 1705, Governor Cornbury and Lewis Morris ‚Äì despite the animosity between the two ‚Äì arranged to add 215 acres from Morris's holdings, known as The Queen's Farm, to the Trinity Church holdings.Bonomi 1998, p. 70. Booth 1859, pp. 273‚Äì274: That same year, Governor Cornbury established the first free grammar school in New York City. The site was earmarked for a new college, which was finally founded in 1754 as King's College.Not the current King's College of New York, which was founded in 1938 On 1 May 1784 the name was changed to Columbia University.McCaughey, Robert (2003). Stand, Columbia : A History of Columbia University in the City of New York. New York, New York: Columbia University Press. p. 1. .Matthews, Brander; John Pine; Harry Peck; Munroe Smith (1904).

Columbia University denies having ties to the former governor:Matthews, Brander; John Pine; Harry Peck; Munroe Smith (1904), A History of Columbia University: 1754‚Äì1904. London, England: Macmillan Company, pages 8‚Äì10. The first street in New York was paved, with sidewalks install in 1648 by Anneke Lockermans Van Cortland, when the city was still New Amsterdam. This set the tone for the English to follow. During the second half of Cornbury's term, the streets and sidewalks were paved with cobblestone (in the area around Trinity Church), fire-buckets were positioned throughout the town, and a fledgling fire department was created with two hooks and eight ladders.Valentine, David Ed (1853) History of the City of New York McSperton & Baset Printers https://archive.org/details/ldpd_6499138_000/page/n5 =End of governorship= Meanwhile, in New York, Tory Governor Cornbury had become another casualty of the Whig revolution (he was recalled in June 1708).Alsop 1982, page 57: \\"The selection of Lord Lovelace in March as governor of New York raised expectations that the colony would play a more active role in the war.\\" The cabinet believed that he had been too passive militarily. It also seemed unlikely that he would be able to procure the necessary funding from the contentious colonial assembly.  Post-governorship  In December 1708, he was put under house arrest by the sheriff of New York City for outstanding debts. Since 1705, both the New York & New Jersey Assemblies had refused to appropriate funds for the governor's salary and support of the colonial garrison. Both were forced to survive on borrowed funds, which had led to Cornbury accruing large debts.Wilson 1893, p. 100Bonomi 1998, p. 85: Note that Bonomi only mentions he was arrested in December 1708 and says that he was detained for 17 months. She makes no mention of whether he was under house arrest or in prison. As a result, the ex-governor was still in town to welcome his successor, John Lovelace, Baron of Hurley (who arrived on 18 December 1708.)Wilson 1892, p. 100: The welcoming banquet cost ¬£46 7s. 6d. which Cornbury borrowed from Henry Swift, a wealthy merchant. The New York Assembly refused to reimburse the sum, which only added to Cornbury's debt burden. Unfortunately, the new governor died five months later. Administration of the colony then fell to Richard Ingoldsby, who had been Cornbury's Lieutenant Governor and avid supporter. Thus colonial policy continued unchanged. Colonists continued to beg for Cornbury's intervention in local affairs for at least another decade.Wilson 1892, p. 135 After a series of acting governors, General Robert Hunter arrived in 1710 to fill the post permanently. He served until 1720. Cornbury's fortunes found reversal soon after his recall as governor. His father's death elevated him to the Peerage, and with it, Parliamentary immunity against civil actions, thus rescuing him from debtors' prison (31 Oct 1709). Upon his return to England, the queen awarded him a pension and lodging at Somerset House, one of the royal palaces. He joined the Harley Ministry as first commissioner of the admiralty in December 1711.Bonomi 1998, p. 51 Although a member of Harley's cabinet, Cornbury was able to remain untainted by the series of scandals that rocked the Tory leadership during this period: His old mentor, the Duke of Marlborough was removed from his place as Captain-General (29 December 1711), charged with bribery and embezzlement. Several \\"High Tories\\" were implicated in the (Catholic) Jacobite rising of 1715, which supported James Francis Edward Stuart as the successor to the dying queen.James Edward was the son of James II who had been deposed during the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and died in 1701. And finally, he was not linked to Harley's South Seas Bubble, which caused the ruin and bankruptcy of many aristocrats and office holders in 1720‚Äì1721.Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford, lived 1661‚Äì1724. As Queen Anne's Lord High Treasurer (1711‚Äì1714), he was responsible for restructuring the national debt incurred during the war. His solution was the formation of a joint-stock company, the South Sea Company (1711). Due to fraud, insider trading, and bribery, the scheme collapsed after 1721. Shares were issued at ¬£100, reached a high of ¬£1000 in 1720, and fell to less than nominal value by 1721. Much of the aristocracy‚Äîincluding Harley‚Äîwas ruined financially by the scheme. There's no evidence of Cornbury's involvement. =Special emissary to Hanover and death= Amid political turmoil, Queen Anne sent Cornbury as a replacement for Harley's emissary to her successor, George, Elector of Hannover (1660‚Äì1727; King 1714‚Äì1727). From his arrival in August 1714 until the Queen's death in November, Cornbury dined and spent his evenings with the royal family. \\"My Lord Clarendon is very much approved of at Court\\", wrote his secretary, John Gay.Bonomi 1998, pp. 52‚Äì55 Once King George I assumed the British throne following the Hanoverian Succession, his animosity toward the Tories became apparent, and Cornbury lost his position as an emissary. Cornbury continued to be active in the House of Lords until about 1720.Bonomi 1998, pp. 54‚Äì55 He died on 31 March 1723 at Chelsea, London, his death received little notice. He is interred in the Henry VII chapel in Westminster Abbey, in the Hyde family crypt.Bonomi 1998, p. 55 Conduct in office Hyde has maintained a scandalous reputation for much of history, known for being highly corrupt and being an easy caricature of the wrongs and incompetence that American colonists saw in British colonialism.Bonomi 1998 p. 3: \\"Edward Hyde, Lord Cornbury, is notorious in the historical literature as a moral profligate, sunk in corruption, and perhaps the worst governor Britain ever imposed on an American colony. ... Soon historians were portraying him as the embodiment of all that was wrong with the empire, some drew a line directly from Cornbury's administration in the first decade of the eighteenth century to the coming of the Revolution in 1776.\\" Author and journalist Shelly Ross agreed with this viewpoint and saw Cornbury as corrupt, in both moral and governmental terms.Ross 1988, p. 3: Ross calls Cornbury a \\"thief, a bigot, a grafter, a drunk, and, strange as it was, a transvestite.\\" Ross wrote that Cornbury's alleged conduct helped to start the American Revolution, and that framers of the constitution had Lord Cornbury in mind when they wrote the articles of impeachment.Ross 1988 p. 3: \\"The combination of public and private wrongdoings was so outrageous that Lord Cornbury fanned the fires of revolution and later served as an inspiration for the articles of impeachment in the United States Constitution. Never again would anyone have to endure such a despicable or corrupt leader without legal recourse for removal from office.\\" The only modern biography that focuses solely on Hyde was written by New York University professor Patricia Bonomi in 1998 and takes a more nuanced view of Cornbury. = Alleged cross-dressing = Lord Cornbury was infamously alleged to have opened the 1702 New York Assembly in drag. He wore a \\"hooped gown and elaborate headdress and carrying a fan, much in the style of the fashionable Queen Anne.\\" Ross 1988, p. 4 A 2018 editorial in The New York Times on gender issues suggested that Cornbury was transgender. Ross, writing in 1988, called him a \\"transvestite\\" and takes his cross-dressing as fact. However, Bonomi (1998) concluded that he was not a crossdresser, as a royal governor could not have publicly cross-dressed without severe censure.Bonomi 1998, p.141: \\"That a royal governor could have publicly displayed himself in women's clothes, as Cornbury is alleged to have done, and escaped severe censure seems doubtful\\" Bonomi further stated \\"there is no evidence to indicate that Cornbury was a homosexual\\",Bonomi 1998, p. 145 \\"There is no evidence to indicate that Cornbury was a homosexual\\" but that it was difficult to conclude whether or not he was transgender.Bonomi 1998, p. 146 She notes that Cornbury's preoccupation with \\"military matters and manly honour\\" could be evidence of trying to compensate for gender dysphoria, or that the death of his wife in 1706 may have \\"emboldened him to attempt to \\"pass\\" in public as a woman.\\"Bonomi 1998, p. 145 Bonomi ultimately concludes that Lord Cornbury's crossdressing was invented by his political enemies in order to \\"assassinate\\" Cornbury's character.Bonomi 1998, p. 186 \\"Cornbury's political enemies being content to merely assassinate his character\\" [As opposed to assassinate, as happened in 1710 to Daniel Parke, Governor of the British West Indian Leeward Islands] As the 18th century unfolded, Britain experienced the rise of moral reform societies determined to purge \\"sodomy\\" and \\"transvestism\\" from society. Cornbury's reputation suffered as these groups gained increasing influence in British society.Ross p. 4: \\"The first signs of Cornbury's eccentricities emerged when he asked [for] a special allowance of two thousand pounds ... The taxpayers agreed, and His High Mightiness, as he preferred to be called, was presented with the money at a banquet in his honour. After the dining, dancing and merriment he took to the stage to address his people. ... Lord Cornbury delivered an embarrassing dissertation on the sensual beauty of his wife's ears. If that wasn't enough, he insisted that all attending the banquet touch Lady Cornbury's ears and see for themselves.\\" = Monetary corruption = According to Ross, Cornbury dispensed thousands of state acres in a corrupt fashion. The most solid evidence of misappropriation of land by Lord Cornbury came in 1706 when he granted a swath of government land south of Albany to nine friends of his, which included his secretary. The transaction, which included part of the Great Nine Partners Patent, was likely illegal and was sold by Hyde for cash. The land would eventually become Hyde Park (named for Lord Cornbury), famous for being the home of Franklin D. Roosevelt.Ross 1988, p. 6: \\"Cornbury \\"Gave\\" many of his friends large‚Äîand illegal‚Äîland grants in return for cash. Among the hundreds of thousands of acres he gave away was one tract of land south of Albany, known as the Hardenbergh tract, which was then larger than the entire colony of Connecticut. Another tract was given to a group of nine friends that included his secretary. In return, they named the land Hyde park after Cornbury's family. That land is remembered today not as the estate which honoured the much-despised Lord Cornbury, but as the homestead of the beloved Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose family bought the property two hundred years later.\\" Lewis Morris, eventual Governor of New Jersey and political rival of Lord Cornbury Virtually every reference written about Lord Cornbury has described him in disparaging terms. The criticisms can be traced back to a spring 1706 complaint written to the newly appointed Whig ministry by Lewis Morris (1671‚Äì1746), and Samuel Jennings (about 1660‚Äì1708) in behalf of the New Jersey Assembly.Wilson 1892, p. 77 In 1708, the New York Assembly followed suit with their letter.Wilson 1892, pp. 84‚Äì85 Specific accusations included: * Asserting royal prerogative over locally elected assemblies * Accepting bribes * Persecution of the Presbyterians by confiscating church property and imprisoning their ministers * Embezzlement of defense funds * Fiscal mismanagement, leading to a large amount of public & personal debt Such complaints were commonplace during that era. Similar allegations were made about the royal governors who preceded and succeeded Cornbury ‚Äì both in New York & New Jersey, and in the other colonies.For example, Marlborough, Sunderland, Harley, and Governors Slaughter, Bellomont, Hunter et al. see Booth (1859) pages 232, 245, 285‚Äì286, & 292 and Wilson (1892), page 104 What was unique about Governor Cornbury was the allegation of wearing women's clothes.Ross 1988, p. 4 A generation later, the story was told of a conversation about Lord Cornbury between the famous Whig minister & author Horace Walpole (1717‚Äì1797)Horace's father, Prime Minister Robert Walpole (Whig), served in the Sunderland ministry that recalled Cornbury from the colonies. and author George James Williams (1719‚Äì1805).Bonomi 1998, p. 15. See also: Benson, Eric, \\"English King Appoints Drag Queen ‚Äì The Complete History of Scandals\\", in The History of New York Scandals, New York magazine, 2 April 2012 Walpole recounted that: Williams reply was reportedly: Family Lord Cornbury eloped with Katherine O'Brien, the 8th Baroness Clifton on 10 July 1685. She was the daughter of Henry O'Brien, Lord Ibrackan, 7th Earl of Thomond. Lady Cornbury died at the age of 33 in New York on 11 August 1706 and was buried at Trinity Church, New York.Bonomi, p. 55 Children: * Catherine Hyde. Died young. * Mary Hyde (‚Äì1697) * Edward Hyde, Viscount Cornbury & 9th Baron Clifton (1691‚ÄìFebruary 1713), Died unmarried at age 22 due to fever. * Theodosia Hyde, 10th Baroness Clifton (9 November 1695 ‚Äì 30 July 1722) Married August 1713 to John Bligh, the 1st Earl of Darnley (1687‚Äì1728). Died of sepsis at age 26 shortly after the birth of her 7th child. =Portrait= No confirmed contemporary portraits of Cornbury exist. An uncaptioned 18th- century portrait that hangs in the New-York Historical Society has been commonly believed to be Governor Cornbury wearing a dress. Professor Bonomi suggested that the subject was not Cornbury.Bonomi, Patricia (Jan 1994) U. \\"Lord Cornbury Redressed: The Governor and the Problem Portrait\\", William and Mary Quarterly, Third Series, Volume 51, Issue 1, pages 106‚Äì118. However, other art historians have remained unconvinced.Eric Pace, \\"A Tempest in a Portrait: Was that Lady a Lord?\\", The New York Times, 30 May 1990 An alleged portrait of Lord Cornbury, wearing a dress. Artist unknown, painted sometime between 1705 and 1750. Lord Cornbury died in the 1720s, making it possible the portrait was posthumous. It resembles a similar portrait that hangs in the New-York Historical Society. The Dallas Museum of Art has a different portrait of unknown provenance also ascribed to be Lord Cornbury in a Dress, painted sometime between 1705 and 1750. In popular culture Androboros [\\"man-eater\\" in corrupted Greek], a play by Robert Hunter, Cornbury's successor as Governor of New York (1710‚Äì1719) was a satire that ridiculed prominent New York citizens, including Lord Cornbury (as \\"Lord Oinobaros\\" [\\"heavy with wine\\"]). Crossdressing was a central theme in the play. It was one of the first plays written and published in Britain's American colonies. It was recently revived by the Peculiar Works Project of New York City on 4‚Äì6 November 2016, under the direction of Ralph Lewis. Cornbury was the lead character in the play Cornbury: The Queen's Governor ‚Äì first presented as a staged reading at The Public Theater on 12 April 1976, the play was written by William M. Hoffman and Anthony Holland. Joseph Papp produced and Holland directed, with Joseph Maher in the role of Cornbury. The play was revived in 2009 at the Hudson Guild Theater under the direction of Tim Cusack. David Greenspan played Cornbury. He also made appearances in Edward Rutherfurd's historical saga novel New York, in Daniel Pinkwater's \\"The Adventures of a Cat-Whiskered Girl\\", and in Robert McCammon's \\"Matthew Corbett\\" series of novels. Cornbury was referenced in an episode of the podcast Cum Town, where they discuss his cross-dressing and flamboyant manner as an early example of open transgenderism.

It has been proposed as the first species in a new phylum. Strains of this microbe were also found on the Sub-polar Mid Oceanic Ridge, and in the Obsidian Pool in Yellowstone National Park. Since it grows in temperatures approaching boiling, at about 80 degrees Celsius, it is considered to be a thermophile. It grows best in environments with a pH of 6, and a salinity concentration of 2%. Nanoarchaeum appears to be an obligate symbiont on the archaeon Ignicoccus; it must be in contact with the host organism to survive. Nanoarchaeum equitans cannot synthesize lipids but obtains them from its host. Its cells are only 400 nm in diameter, making it one of the smallest known cellular organisms, and the smallest known archaeon. N. equitans genome consists of a single circular chromosome, and has an average GC-content of 31.6%. It lacks almost all of the genes required for the synthesis of amino acids, nucleotides, cofactors, and lipids, but encodes everything needed for repair and replication. A total of 95% of its DNA encodes for proteins or stable RNA molecules. N. equitans has small appendages that come out of its circular structure. The cell surface is covered by a thin, lattice-shaped S-layer, which provides structure and protection for the entire cell. Genome Mycoplasma genitalium (580 Kbp in size, with 515 protein-coding genes) was regarded as a cellular unit with the smallest genome size until 2003 when Nanoarchaeum was sequenced (491 Kbp, with 536 protein- coding genes). Genetically, Nanoarchaeum is peculiar in that its 16S RNA sequence is undetectable by the most common methods. Initial examination of single-stranded ribosomal RNA indicated that the organism most likely belonged to the Archaea domain. However, its difference from the existing phyla, Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota, was as great as the difference between the phyla. Therefore, it was given its own phylum, called Nanoarchaeota. However, another group (see References) compared all of the open reading frames to the other Archaea. They argue that the initial sample, ribosomal RNA only, was biased and Nanoarchaeum actually belongs to the Euryarchaeota phylum. The sequencing of the Nanoarchaeum genome has revealed a wealth of information about the organism's biology. The genes for several vital metabolic pathways appear to be missing. Nanoarchaeum cannot synthesize most nucleotides, amino acids, lipids, and cofactors. The cell most likely obtains these biomolecules from Ignicoccus. However, unlike many parasitic microbes, Nanoarchaeum has many DNA repair enzymes, as well as everything necessary to carry out DNA replication, transcription, and translation. This may explain why the genome lacks the large stretches of non-coding DNA characteristic of other parasites. The organism's ability to produce its own ATP is also in question. Nanoarchaeum lacks the ability to metabolize hydrogen and sulfur for energy, as many thermophiles do. It does have five subunits of an ATP synthase as well as pathways for oxidative deamination. Whether it obtains energy from biological molecules imported from Ignicoccus, or whether it receives ATP directly is currently unknown. The genome and proteome composition of N. equitans are marked with the signatures of dual adaptation ‚Äì one to high temperature and the other to obligate parasitism (or symbiosis).

The King's children are still ranked according to male-preference cognatic primogeniture, which was the norm between 1971 and 1990; Crown Prince Haakon and his eligible descendants thus take precedence over his older sister, Princess M√§rtha Louise, and her eligible descendants.

Italy also lost its concession in Tianjin, which was turned over to China, and the Dodecanese Islands in the Aegean Sea were ceded to Greece. Italy lost Istria: the provinces of Fiume, Zara, and most of Gorizia and Pola were ceded to Yugoslavia; the rest of Istria and the province of Trieste formed a new sovereign State (Free Territory of Trieste) divided in two administrative zones under a provisional government for which the United Nations Security Council was responsible.Article 21 and Annex VII, Instrument for the Provisional Regime of the Free Territory of TriesteUnited Nations Security Council 16, 10 January 1947 In 1954, Italy incorporated the Province of Trieste (Zone A) and Yugoslavia incorporated the rest of Istria (Zone B). This was officially recognized with the Treaty of Osimo in 1975. The villages of the Tende valley and La Brigue were ceded to France but Italian diplomats were able to maintain in place the Treaty of Turin (1860), according to which the French-Italian alpine border passes through the summit of Mont Blanc, despite French demands on the Aosta Valley. Anyhow the French Republic has never adopted any form of bilingualism in the towns of Briga and Tenda destining these municipalities to forced assimilation to French language. The province of South Tyrol was also kept by Italy despite the territorial demands of Austria, largely thanks to the Gruber‚ÄìDe Gasperi Agreement signed some months before. =Finland= Finland was restored to its borders of 1 January 1941 (thus confirming its territorial losses after the Winter War of 1939-40), except for the former province of Petsamo, which was ceded to the Soviet Union. In Finland, the reparations and the dictated border adjustment were perceived as a major injustice and a betrayal by the Western powers, after the sympathy Finland had received from the West during the Soviet-initiated Winter War. However, this sympathy had been eroded by Finland's collaboration with Nazi Germany between 1941 and 1944. During this time, Finland not only recaptured territory it had lost in 1940, but continued its offensive deeper into Soviet lands, occupying a broad strip of Soviet territory. This prompted the United Kingdom to declare war on Finland in December 1941, further weakening political support in the West for the country. The Soviet Union's accessions of Finnish territory was based on the Moscow Armistice signed in Moscow on 19 September 1944 and resulted in an extension of the accessions in the Moscow Peace Treaty that ended the Winter War. =Hungary= Hungary was restored to its borders before 1938. This meant restoring the southern border with Yugoslavia, as well as declaring the First and Second Vienna Awards null and void, cancelling Hungary's gains from Czechoslovakia and Romania. Furthermore, three villages (namely Horv√°t√∫jfalu, Oroszv√°r, and Dunacs√∫n) situated south of Bratislava were also transferred to Czechoslovakia. =Romania= Romania was restored to its borders of 1 January 1941, with the exception of the border with Hungary giving Northern Transylvania back to Romania. This confirmed the 1940 loss of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union and the Treaty of Craiova, which returned Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria. =Bulgaria= Bulgaria was restored to its borders of 1 January 1941, returning Vardar Macedonia to Yugoslavia and Eastern Macedonia and Western Thrace to Greece, but keeping Southern Dobruja per the Treaty of Craiova, leaving Bulgaria as the only former Axis power to keep territory that was gained during the Second World War. War reparations The war reparation problem proved to be one of the most difficult arising from post-war conditions. The Soviet Union, the country most heavily ravaged by the war, felt entitled to the maximum amounts possible, with the exception of Bulgaria, which was perceived as being the most sympathetic of the former enemy states. (Bulgaria was part of the Axis but did not declare war on the Soviet Union). In the cases of Romania and Hungary, the reparation terms as set forth in their armistices were relatively high and were not revised. War reparations at 1938 prices, in United States dollar amounts: *$360,000,000 from Italy: **$125,000,000 to Yugoslavia; **$105,000,000 to Greece; **$100,000,000 to the Soviet Union; **$25,000,000 to Ethiopia; **$5,000,000 to Albania. *$300,000,000 Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union *$300,000,000 from Hungary: **$200,000,000 to the Soviet Union; **$100,000,000 to Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. *$300,000,000 from Romania to the Soviet Union; *$70,000,000 from Bulgaria: **$45,000,000 to Greece; **$25,000,000 to Yugoslavia. Aftermath The dissolution of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia in the early 1990s did not lead to any renegotiation of the Paris Peace Treaties. However, in 1990 Finland unilaterally cancelled the restrictions the treaty had placed on its military.http://www.nato.int/docu/review/1993/9301-3.htm See also *Aftermath of World War II *Allied Commission *Potsdam Agreement (1945, regarding Germany) *Moscow Conference (1945) *Treaty of San Francisco (1951, regarding Japan) *Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany (1990) *Soviet occupation of Romania *World War II reparations towards Yugoslavia References External links United States Department of State Foreign relations of the United States, 1946.

In mathematics, affine geometry is what remains of Euclidean geometry when not using (mathematicians often say \\"when forgetting\\"See also forgetful functor.) the metric notions of distance and angle. As the notion of parallel lines is one of the main properties that is independent of any metric, affine geometry is often considered as the study of parallel lines. Therefore, Playfair's axiom (given a line L and a point P not on L, there is exactly one line parallel to L that passes through P) is fundamental in affine geometry. Comparisons of figures in affine geometry are made with affine transformations, which are mappings that preserve alignment of points and parallelism of lines. Affine geometry can be developed in two ways that are essentially equivalent. (Reprint of the 1957 original; A Wiley-Interscience Publication) In synthetic geometry, an affine space is a set of points to which is associated a set of lines, which satisfy some axioms (such as Playfair's axiom). Affine geometry can also be developed on the basis of linear algebra. In this context an affine space is a set of points equipped with a set of transformations (that is bijective mappings), the translations, which forms a vector space (over a given field, commonly the real numbers), and such that for any given ordered pair of points there is a unique translation sending the first point to the second; the composition of two translations is their sum in the vector space of the translations. In more concrete terms, this amounts to having an operation that associates to any ordered pair of points a vector and another operation that allows translation of a point by a vector to give another point; these operations are required to satisfy a number of axioms (notably that two successive translations have the effect of translation by the sum vector). By choosing any point as \\"origin\\", the points are in one-to-one correspondence with the vectors, but there is no preferred choice for the origin; thus an affine space may be viewed as obtained from its associated vector space by \\"forgetting\\" the origin (zero vector). Although this article only discusses affine spaces, the notion of \\"forgetting the metric\\" is much more general, and can be applied to arbitrary manifolds, in general. This extension of the notion of affine spaces to manifolds in general is developed in the article on the affine connection. History In 1748, Leonhard Euler introduced the term affine (Latin affinis, \\"related\\") in his book Introductio in analysin infinitorum (volume 2, chapter XVIII). In 1827, August M√∂bius wrote on affine geometry in his Der barycentrische Calcul (chapter 3). After Felix Klein's Erlangen program, affine geometry was recognized as a generalization of Euclidean geometry. In 1912, Edwin B. Wilson and Gilbert N. Lewis developed an affine geometryEdwin B.

From Euclid to Eddington: a study of conceptions of the external world, Dover Publications, p. 130. : Weyl's geometry is interesting historically as having been the first of the affine geometries to be worked out in detail: it is based on a special type of parallel transport [...using] worldlines of light-signals in four-dimensional space-time. A short element of one of these world-lines may be called a null-vector; then the parallel transport in question is such that it carries any null-vector at one point into the position of a null-vector at a neighboring point. In 1984, \\"the affine plane associated to the Lorentzian vector space L2\\" was described by Graciela Birman and Katsumi Nomizu in an article entitled \\"Trigonometry in Lorentzian geometry\\".Graciela S. Birman & Katsumi Nomizu (1984). \\"Trigonometry in Lorentzian geometry\\", American Mathematical Monthly 91(9):543-9, Lorentzian affine plane: p. 544 Systems of axioms Several axiomatic approaches to affine geometry have been put forward: =Pappus' law= Pappus law: if the red lines are parallel and the blue lines are parallel, then the dotted black lines must be parallel. As affine geometry deals with parallel lines, one of the properties of parallels noted by Pappus of Alexandria has been taken as a premise:Veblen 1918: p. 103 (figure), and p. 118 (exercise 3).Coxeter 1955, The Affine Plane, ¬ß 2: Affine geometry as an independent system * If A, B, C are on one line and A', B', C' on another, then : (AB' \\\\parallel A'B \\\\ \\\\land \\\\ BC' \\\\parallel B'C) \\\\Rightarrow CA' \\\\parallel C'A. The full axiom system proposed has point, line, and line containing point as primitive notions: * Two points are contained in just one line. * For any line l and any point P, not on l, there is just one line containing P and not containing any point of l. This line is said to be parallel to l. * Every line contains at least two points. * There are at least three points not belonging to one line. According to H. S. M. Coxeter: : The interest of these five axioms is enhanced by the fact that they can be developed into a vast body of propositions, holding not only in Euclidean geometry but also in Minkowski‚Äôs geometry of time and space (in the simple case of 1 + 1 dimensions, whereas the special theory of relativity needs 1 + 3). The extension to either Euclidean or Minkowskian geometry is achieved by adding various further axioms of orthogonality, etcCoxeter 1955, Affine plane, p. 8 The various types of affine geometry correspond to what interpretation is taken for rotation. Euclidean geometry corresponds to the ordinary idea of rotation, while Minkowski's geometry corresponds to hyperbolic rotation. With respect to perpendicular lines, they remain perpendicular when the plane is subjected to ordinary rotation. In the Minkowski geometry, lines that are hyperbolic-orthogonal remain in that relation when the plane is subjected to hyperbolic rotation. =Ordered structure= An axiomatic treatment of plane affine geometry can be built from the axioms of ordered geometry by the addition of two additional axioms:Coxeter, Introduction to Geometry, p. 192 # (Affine axiom of parallelism) Given a point A and a line r, not through A, there is at most one line through A which does not meet r. # (Desargues) Given seven distinct points A, A', B, B', C, C', O, such that AA', BB', and CC' are distinct lines through O and AB is parallel to A'B' and BC is parallel to B'C', then AC is parallel to A'C'. The affine concept of parallelism forms an equivalence relation on lines. Since the axioms of ordered geometry as presented here include properties that imply the structure of the real numbers, those properties carry over here so that this is an axiomatization of affine geometry over the field of real numbers. =Ternary rings= The first non- Desarguesian plane was noted by David Hilbert in his Foundations of Geometry.David Hilbert, 1980 (1899). The Foundations of Geometry, 2nd ed., Chicago: Open Court, weblink from Project Gutenberg, p. 74. The Moulton plane is a standard illustration. In order to provide a context for such geometry as well as those where Desargues theorem is valid, the concept of a ternary ring has been developed. Rudimentary affine planes are constructed from ordered pairs taken from a ternary ring. A plane is said to have the \\"minor affine Desargues property\\" when two triangles in parallel perspective, having two parallel sides, must also have the third sides parallel. If this property holds in the rudimentary affine plane defined by a ternary ring, then there is an equivalence relation between \\"vectors\\" defined by pairs of points from the plane.Rafael Artzy (1965). Linear Geometry, Addison-Wesley, p. 213. Furthermore, the vectors form an abelian group under addition, the ternary ring is linear, and satisfies right distributivity: : (a + b) c = ac + bc. Affine transformations Geometrically, affine transformations (affinities) preserve collinearity: so they transform parallel lines into parallel lines and preserve ratios of distances along parallel lines. We identify as affine theorems any geometric result that is invariant under the affine group (in Felix Klein's Erlangen programme this is its underlying group of symmetry transformations for affine geometry). Consider in a vector space V, the general linear group GL(V). It is not the whole affine group because we must allow also translations by vectors v in V. (Such a translation maps any w in V to w + v.) The affine group is generated by the general linear group and the translations and is in fact their semidirect product V \\\\rtimes \\\\mathrm{GL}(V). (Here we think of V as a group under its operation of addition, and use the defining representation of GL(V) on V to define the semidirect product.) For example, the theorem from the plane geometry of triangles about the concurrence of the lines joining each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side (at the centroid or barycenter) depends on the notions of mid-point and centroid as affine invariants. Other examples include the theorems of Ceva and Menelaus. Affine invariants can also assist calculations. For example, the lines that divide the area of a triangle into two equal halves form an envelope inside the triangle. The ratio of the area of the envelope to the area of the triangle is affine invariant, and so only needs to be calculated from a simple case such as a unit isosceles right angled triangle to give \\\\tfrac{3}{4} \\\\log_e(2) - \\\\tfrac{1}{2}, i.e. 0.019860... or less than 2%, for all triangles. Familiar formulas such as half the base times the height for the area of a triangle, or a third the base times the height for the volume of a pyramid, are likewise affine invariants. While the latter is less obvious than the former for the general case, it is easily seen for the one-sixth of the unit cube formed by a face (area 1) and the midpoint of the cube (height 1/2). Hence it holds for all pyramids, even slanting ones whose apex is not directly above the center of the base, and those with base a parallelogram instead of a square. The formula further generalizes to pyramids whose base can be dissected into parallelograms, including cones by allowing infinitely many parallelograms (with due attention to convergence). The same approach shows that a four-dimensional pyramid has 4D volume one quarter the 3D volume of its parallelepiped base times the height, and so on for higher dimensions. Affine space Affine geometry can be viewed as the geometry of an affine space of a given dimension n, coordinatized over a field K. There is also (in two dimensions) a combinatorial generalization of coordinatized affine space, as developed in synthetic finite geometry. In projective geometry, affine space means the complement of a hyperplane at infinity in a projective space. Affine space can also be viewed as a vector space whose operations are limited to those linear combinations whose coefficients sum to one, for example 2x ‚àí y, x ‚àí y + z, (x + y + z)/3, ix + (1 ‚àí i)y, etc. Synthetically, affine planes are 2-dimensional affine geometries defined in terms of the relations between points and lines (or sometimes, in higher dimensions, hyperplanes). Defining affine (and projective) geometries as configurations of points and lines (or hyperplanes) instead of using coordinates, one gets examples with no coordinate fields. A major property is that all such examples have dimension 2. Finite examples in dimension 2 (finite affine planes) have been valuable in the study of configurations in infinite affine spaces, in group theory, and in combinatorics. Despite being less general than the configurational approach, the other approaches discussed have been very successful in illuminating the parts of geometry that are related to symmetry. Projective view In traditional geometry, affine geometry is considered to be a study between Euclidean geometry and projective geometry. On the one hand, affine geometry is Euclidean geometry with congruence left out; on the other hand, affine geometry may be obtained from projective geometry by the designation of a particular line or plane to represent the points at infinity.H. S. M. Coxeter (1942). Non-Euclidean Geometry, University of Toronto Press, pp. 18, 19. In affine geometry, there is no metric structure but the parallel postulate does hold. Affine geometry provides the basis for Euclidean structure when perpendicular lines are defined, or the basis for Minkowski geometry through the notion of hyperbolic orthogonality.Coxeter 1942, p. 178 In this viewpoint, an affine transformation is a projective transformation that does not permute finite points with points at infinity, and affine transformation geometry is the study of geometrical properties through the action of the group of affine transformations.

Dinghy sailing is the activity of sailing small boats by using five essential controls: * the sails * the foils (i.e. the daggerboard or centreboard and rudder and sometimes lifting foils as found on the Moth) * the trim (forward/rear angle of the boat in the water) * side- to-side balance of the dinghy by hiking or movement of the crew, particularly in windy weather (\\"move fast or swim\\") * the choice of route (in terms of existing and anticipated wind shifts, possible obstacles, other water traffic, currents, tides etc.) When racing, the above skills need to be refined and additional skills and techniques learned, such as the application of the \\"racing rules of sailing\\", boat handling skills when starting and when rounding marks, and knowledge of tactics and strategy. Racing tactics include positioning the boat at different angles. To improve speed when racing, sailors should position themselves at the windward direction (closest to the direction of the wind) in order to get \\"clean air\\". The RYA, the regulating authority for sail training in the UK and Europe, states that, \\"With a reliance on nature and the elements, sailing ... is about adventure, exploration, teamwork and fun.\\" Development of the dinghy = Early beginnings = There has always been a need for small tender boats for transporting goods and personnel to and from anchored sailing ships. Together with other smaller work craft such as fishing and light cargo, small inshore craft have always been in evidence. Charles II of England had a private sailing boat presented to him when he returned from exile to England in the 17th century, and he sailed for recreation and competition. In 1887 Thomas Middleton, a Dublin solicitor, considered that yacht racing was becoming an excessively expensive activity, with boats becoming eclipsed by better designs each year. He proposed the 'One Model' principle. He wanted yacht racing to be an exercise of skill with all boats being built to the same design. He assembled a group of potential owners who agreed to call the boat 'The Water Wag'. The Water Wag Club still prospers in D√∫n Laoghaire harbour, with racing each Wednesday evening during the Summer season. Towards the end of the 19th century people began to use these small boats for sport and recreational sailing, utilising the opportunities for leisure afforded by the industrial revolution. Larger privately used sailing boats had developed separately, and have resulted in the yachts of today. There has been some crossover, in that the sloop sail plan was adopted as standard and most convenient by early dinghy designers. =Planing and trapezing= A Musto Performance Skiff dinghy on the reach The development of the sailing dinghy was helped in the early 20th century by Uffa Fox (1898‚Äì1972), an English boat designer and sailing enthusiast. He developed and contributed to many dinghy classes that are still with us nearly a century later: the Albacore, International 14, National 12, Jet 14, Firefly, Flying Fifteen and Scorpion. He also introduced the major advance of hull shapes that can plane, and which can therefore reach beyond the usual speed limits for small sailing boats. In effect, a boat which is planing is skimming along the surface, with the bow of the boat not in the water. This results in less friction because of reduced waterline length, reduced displacement (the amount of water needing to be pushed aside by the boat), and reduced 'wetted area'. The driving force provided by the sails has to overcome less resistance, and therefore speed increases dramatically. In 1928 Uffa Fox introduced planing to the English dinghy racing world in his International 14 boat, the Avenger. He gained 52 first places, two second places and three third places out of 57 race starts that year. Note: Graham Anderson in his 1999 book Fast Light Boats, a Century of Kiwi Innovation argues that planing centreboard sailing boats were introduced into New Zealand in the early 20th century ‚Äì well before Uffa Fox popularised the concept. Another advance in dinghy sailing was introduced in the 1930s, when the technique of trapezing was introduced. This involves using the crew to provide more leverage (than possible by hiking out) to keep the sails vertical and the boat balanced; doing this can prevent the boat from capsizing, by hanging outside the boat on a harness and rope attached to the 'hounds' or upper mast. As a result, the boat is easier to keep upright, and the sails can deliver maximum power most of the time. While trapezing can be helpful and increase speed, it can also be very dangerous if the crew is not wearing a quick- release harness or is inexperienced. The quick-release harness allows the crew to unstrap themselves quickly so as to not get forced under the boat if it were to capsize. Trapezing during a race first appeared in 1934, on the Amazon A Class Rater Vagabond 14 foot international sailed by Peter Scott (son of the famous Scott of the Antarctic), and John Winter. The owner of the boat, Beecher Moore, of Thames Sailing Club, had worked on developing the technique, in discussion with Uffa Fox. Vagabond was spectacularly successful in that race, winning by four minutes. The innovative technique was immediately banned, and received little development until it was reintroduced on the Osprey and Fiveohfive Class (505) in 1954 by John Westell and the Flying Dutchman class in the early 1960s. =Post WWII developments= During the Second World War plywood had become a major building material for aircraft. After the war, plywood was adapted for building sailing dinghies. Two primary methods of construction were adopted: stitch and glue and timber-framed construction. Jack Holt designed many dinghies to be built by home handymen using these construction techniques. The Mirror Dinghy was predominantly built using stitch and glue, while the Enterprise and Heron is an example of a boat built using plywood on a timber frame. =Modern developments= 49er skiff in a race At the beginning of the 21st century, dinghy sailing is still a rapidly developing sport. It is losing its image of being expensive, time consuming, and exclusive. This is because of the earlier work of pioneers such as Uffa Fox, and through the use of modern designs and techniques such as lighter hull materials (e.g., fibreglass and foam sandwich hull construction, which eliminate time-consuming maintenance and constant care that wooden hulls required, although they are rare and only a few people make them some still sail with wooden boats), more responsive sail materials and design, easily transportable boats (many car-toppable), and simpler rigs such as gennakers instead of more complex spinnakers. These advances are more economical in time and money, and have greatly extended the appeal of dinghy sailing. In Britain, the RYA regulates racing and provides modular and accredited training courses for leisure and competitive sailing. A basic sailing course can be completed in several days. Similar organisations exist worldwide to administer and promote both leisure and competitive sailing. Types of dinghies Names of sailing dinghy parts Some dinghies come into more than one category, either because boundaries overlap or because different categories are measuring different things; e.g. both \\"one design\\" boats and boats of much freer design can be found in each of the main categories below. Dinghy designs are often referred to as \\"classes\\"; these classes are usually categorised as one design, open, or restricted. A more formal term for open is \\"Development Class\\". One design dinghies are supposed to be identical, though in reality this is not always the case. Only the most restrictive one design classes will restrict individual fittings. Then there becomes a sliding scale of allowable modification or design differences; restricted classes would typically allow the movement of fittings or even parts of the boat around, but are unlikely to allow major changes to hull shape or sails. Truly open development classes are also almost unknown, the famous line about the 18 ft skiff \\"the boat shall be 18ft long and the race starts at 2 o'clock\\" is a myth but open classes will usually allow pretty radical changes within usually some kind of box rule which specifies depth, length, width of hull height of mast and sometimes a minimum weight and sail area. Classes which are not development classes are usually referred to as \\"One design\\". The idea is that One Designs provide a fair and level playing field for even competition, whereas Development Classes drive boat speed and technology forwards. The first one design was the Water Wag designed by Thomas Middleton, which first sailed in Dublin Bay in 1887. The class is still sailed today, well over a hundred years later. The first International one-design class was the B.R.A. 12 foot dinghy which was designed by George Cockshott in 1914 for West Kirby marine lake. This design expanded to Holland, Netherlands, Germany, France, Ireland etc. and further afield. All of the following classes can be used for recreational as well as racing purposes. Some function better for recreation use because they require less maintenance and can be left on a mooring, while other (usually racing) boats can't be left on mooring because they will capsize, which can cause certain parts like the mast and hull to be damaged. Sailing skiffs are the fastest and arguably most difficult type of dinghy to sail. A skiff has a flat narrow hull with a disproportionately large sailplan, usually consisting of an asymmetric spinnaker, blade jib and fully battened main. Sailors manage the rig with the use of racks (wings) and trapeze. Examples are the 49er, an Olympic boat, 18 Footers (see below) and the advanced International 14. High- performance dinghies are fast and powerful dinghies designed for racing around an Olympic triangle (Olympic Racing Course). Examples of such dinghies are the International Flying Dutchman, the International 505, the Jet 14, the Fireball, the Osprey, the Thistle, the 14 ft John Spencer Javelin and the International 470. They can all plane easily, even upwind and they use trapeze and a symmetric spinnaker. Not all are two handed boats: the International Contender and the RS600 are high performance single handed boats equipped with a trapeze, but not a spinnaker, and demonstrate a comparable performance. Skiffs are usually classed as High performance dinghies. Racing dinghies are designed for racing, but not all have necessarily the same calibre of performance as the above. However, in many cases they can still offer equally close competition, at the very highest standards, which for many racing helmsmen and crews is the most important consideration. They cover a wide range, and many are descended from Uffa Fox's seminal International 14. People often \\"travel\\" with their dinghies to international races in famous sailing spots such as Lake Garda in Italy. The Snipe International Class still stands as one of the strongest classes, after reaching the status of world's largest fleet of dinghies in July 1936. Other examples include the GP14, Enterprise, Solo, Graduate, Firefly, Lark. A specialized subgroup is the Scow, which typically uses two bilgeboards instead of a centerboard, and may have two rudders. Many racing dinghies require two or more people to sail the boat, the skipper is in charge or steering and the main sail depending on the boat, and the crew is in charge of the jib, the spinnaker,(which can only be flown while going downwind) and keeping the boat level Cruising dinghies are designed for leisure and family sailing and are usually more stable than high-performance dinghies. This is provided by a 'chined' (less rounded) hull, greater displacement, and proportionally smaller sail area. Some are specifically designed for longer passage-making, and/or for camping aboard. Examples of these include the Wayfarer, arguably the GP14, the Tideway, the Laser Stratos, the Drascombe series of dinghies, the CL 16 and the Laser 16, the Roamer Cruising Dinghy, designed by Eric Coleman an early member of the Dinghy Cruising Association, plus many designs of Iain Oughtred, John Welsford and Fran√ßois Vivier. Sailing these boats can still give much excitement. Cruiser- racer dinghies successfully combine elements of both the immediately previous two groups, offering good racing performance and also being very viable cruising boats. Arguably the only two world-class cruiser-racer dinghies, in terms of both the extensive availability of top class racing and their suitability for serious cruising, are the Wayfarer and the GP14; of these the Wayfarer has the edge for cruising, once on the water, in part because she is the larger boat, while the GP14 has the edge for racing. However the Mirror and her larger sisters, and the Heron, can also be regarded as coming into this category.Wanderer - sail No W48, the open sailing dinghy of the Wayfarer class that Frank Dye sailed to Iceland and Norway. Now in UK National Maritime Museum, Falmouth. Classic dinghies are typically used as yacht tenders or shore boats, and emphasize beauty and versatility over sailing performance. Although some are still made entirely from wood, the majority of the most popular classic sailing dinghies combine a fiberglass hull with enough finely finished teak or mahogany to represent the \\"best of two worlds\\" approach. The fiberglass hull makes the boat maintenance easier and some think they are sturdier and will not corrode like wood. Examples of classic sailing dinghies are Minto, Mirror Dinghy, Fatty Knees, Trinka, Bauer, Whitehall and Gig Harbor. Safety dinghies were designed to be used as yacht tenders with the added function of proactive self-rescue boat that can be sailed to safety. These boats are also used as recreational sailboats. Some of them can be fitted out with exposure canopies, sea anchors, and other survival gear. Examples of safety dinghies are the Portland Pudgy dinghy and the Clam dinghy. Multihullss are fast twin or three hulled boats that fall under the definition of dinghy. Unlike dinghies, multihulls have high aspect ratio rigs with fully battened mainsails and sometimes, a rotating mast. This allows the rig to be highly aerodynamic and the reduced drag from the thin hulls, gives a multihull its great speed advantage over traditional monohulls. Dinghy-sized multihulls are sometimes referred to as \\"Beach Catamarans or Beach Trimarans\\". The International 14 remains a popular racing class, having acquired racks (for trapezing crews) and a gennaker since its original design. The Laser Standard, Laser Radial and Laser 4.7 are the variants of the Laser dinghy, a single- hander whose combination of simplicity, portability and performance has done much to advance dinghy racing and training. More modern dinghies like the Musto Skiff, Splash, RS600 and RS Vareo have also increased dinghy sailing participation around the UK. Two popular dinghies used in high school and college racing are the 420 and Flying Junior. Sports boats: These classes are larger off-shore racing dinghies which shade off into classes of yachts with fixed keels. Usually they have several crew members as well as the helm. Melges 24 and Laser SB3 are current examples of this type. Development classes: Most dinghy classes have a fairly fixed layout of sails and hull design, and changes are very infrequent. However, some classes can compete and sail with less rigid definitions and measurements. This encourages experiment which often leads to innovation in techniques and construction. Examples are the International 14, National 12, the 18ft Skiff, the Puddle Duck Racer and the Moth. The International Moth is worth noting because of its use of lifting foils on the rudder and daggerboard. These generate enough lift to push the hull above the water, significantly reducing friction and allowing speeds in excess of . Learning to sail Portland Pudgy sailing dinghy Many people learn to sail at accredited sailing schools, or through their local sailing club. Many books and training DVDs are also available, allowing the novice sailor to reinforce the learning in their own time. Boats that many children learn to sail in are the Optimist, Topper and the Laser Funboat and Laser Picos. The Optimist is primarily used in supervised racing situations because it is easily capsized and very difficult to right from the water. In the USA, the Portland Pudgy safety dinghy has become a popular beginners' sailing dinghy for non-racing, recreational use because it is unsinkable and very stable. It is easier for children to learn on small boats and work their way up to larger boats as they grow. Children learn better in a protected harbor or cove because there is less wind than the wide open ocean. The Wayfarer was the standard teaching boats for adult schemes; however, many centres have moved onto more modern 'Centre-Main' boats such as the Laser Stratos and Topaz Omega. In Australia the main boats children learn in are Sabot (dinghy), Manly Junior, Heron, Topaz Dinghy, Flying Eleven, Optimist with the O'pen BIC becoming more popular. Adults often learn in Spirals or Sabres or by crewing in NS14s or Tasars. In the UK, the Royal Yachting Association is the governing body of all dinghy sailing qualifications, offering Youth Stage 1 through 4 certificates, and Adult Level 1 through 3 certificates. More and more boat hire companies ask to see certificates before they will allow you to hire out a boat. In Australia Yachting Australia fulfils a similar role. On yachts in Australia a Competent Crew course is usually the first formal learn to sail course. Dinghy racing Optimist dinghy, still one of the most popular kids' racing dinghies Racing is one of the most popular forms of dinghy sailing, and it contributes to the development of sailing skills as well as to improvements in dinghy and sail construction and design. Sometimes the Olympic triangle is used as a course for dinghy races where space permits, particularly for events where there ought to be little local advantage such as State and National titles and for classes which are mainly displacement sailing such as the Heron (dinghy). The olympic triangle is the most popular choice for dinghy racing, but a windward leeward course is another popular option.

It is the capital of the Stendal District and the unofficial capital of the Altmark region. Geography Situated west of the Elbe valley, the Stendal town centre is located some west of Berlin, around east of Hanover, and north of the state capital Magdeburg. Stendal is the seat of a University of Applied Sciences (Fachhochschule) and preserves a picturesque old town including a historic market and several churches. The nearby village Uchtspringe is home to a psychiatric rehabilitation clinic. Stendal station is the most important interchange and rail hub in the north of Saxony-Anhalt. Located on the Berlin‚ÄìLehrte railway and the parallel Hanover‚ÄìBerlin high-speed railway line, it is regularly served by Intercity and Intercity-Express (ICE) trains. A direct connection to the German Autobahn network is planned with the extension of the BAB 14 from Magdeburg to Schwerin. The municipal area comprises the incorporated villages of Buchholz, Dahlen, Gro√ü Schwechten, Heeren, Insel, M√∂ringen, Nahrstedt, Staats, Uchtspringe, Uenglingen, Vinzelberg, Volgfelde, and Wittenmoor. History St Mary's Church with town hall and Roland statue A settlement named Steinedal in the Eastphalian Balsamgau of Saxony, then a possession of Saint Michael‚Äôs Abbey in Hildesheim, was mentioned in a deed allegedly issued by Emperor Henry II in 1022. However, the entry has proven to be a 12th-century forgery, as the original document contained no such record. The fortified town near the Elbe crossing at Tangerm√ºnde was actually founded and granted Magdeburg rights by the first Brandenburg margrave Albert the Bear about 1160. The parish church of St Mary's was first mentioned in 1283. Stendal quickly prospered as a centre of commerce and trade; it received city walls about 1300, the citizens joined the Hanseatic League in 1358 and purchased the privilege of minting from the Brandenburg margraves in 1369. A Latin school is documented from 1338. In 1456 the Hohenzollern elector Frederick II Irontooth founded a convent of Augustinian nuns, which today is the site of a museum. In 1502 his descendant Elector Joachim I Nestor married Princess Elizabeth of Denmark at Stendal. Magnificent churches, the town hall and the two remaining city gates are still proof of Stendal's former wealth. The Stendal citizens turned Protestant in 1539; with the reformator Konrad Cordatus serving as superintendent. For centuries part of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, Stendal with the Altmark region passed to the Prussian Province of Saxony after the Napoleonic Wars. A Prussian garrison town since the 17th century, it hosted the 10th (Magdeburg) Hussars regiment from 1884. Stendal was the site of a Luftwaffe airfield in World War II, which had been the site of the first German Fallschirmj√§ger training school from 1936; the famous boxer Max Schmeling was trained as a paratrooper here in 1940/41. The town suffered from strategic bombing. In April 1945, the aerodrome served as starting place of the Sonderkommando Elbe unit, only a few days before the local authorities surrendered to the US Army. On May 4, the commander of the Wehrmacht 12th Army, General Maximilian von Edelsheim signed the capitulation document at the Stendal town hall. From 1949 until German reunification in 1990, the town belonged to East Germany, part of Bezirk Magdeburg from 1952. Until 1994, the Stendal barracks served as home base for a riflemen division of the Soviet 2nd Guards Tank Army. In 1983 the construction of the Stendal Nuclear Power Plant was begun north of the town, but abandoned after reunification. In 2009 the Stendal citizens voted for the prefix Hansestadt (\\"Hanse City\\"). Main sights =Theatre of the Altmark= The area has a theatre named Theater der Altmark, Stendal. It was founded in 1946 and has always had a particular involvement in youth and children's theatre. Theatrical performances and dance events are staged, as well as concerts, conferences and meetings. =Winckelmann Museum= The Winckelmann Museum is named after Johann Joachim Winckelmann, the founder of classical archaeology. Its holdings include biographical documents, works, designs and diagrams as well as Greek sculptures or casts, along with other small artworks from antiquity. Since summer 2003 the museum has been the owner of the world's biggest Trojan horse. With its size of 15.60 m high, 13 m long, 9.50 m wide and its weight of 45 tons it offers a beautiful view over Stendal. Exhibitions are held relating to archaeology and the history of art from the 18th and 19th centuries; there is also a modern art museum. The museum is the seat of the Winckelmann-Gesellschaft(the Winckelmann Society). In addition, the museum has exhibits relating to the history and cultural history of the city of Stendal and of the Altmark dating from the prehistoric period through the area's early history right up to the present. There are exhibits pertaining to the Hanseatic League, Romanesque art and local archaeological material. =Fire Brigade Museum= The town also has the Landesfeuerwehrmuseum (Fire Brigade Museum), showing the development of fire fighting and protection from the leather bucket to modern fire engines. =Other= Roland statue in front of the Town Hall Other buildings include the Gothic cathedral, St. Nicholas Church, the Town Hall with the statue of Roland and the two mediaeval town gates. There are also other churches in the area. Stendal is also part of the Altmark cycle path. Information and maps about this cycle path can be had for free from the tourist information office. Politics =Mayor= The Lord Mayor of Stendal is Klaus Schmotz (born 1952). He was elected in 2001 with 74,9 % of the votes. He was reelected in 2008 and 2015. =Local council= Seats in the town's assembly (Stadtrat) as of 2015 local elections: *Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU): 14 *The Left: 11 *Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD): 8 *Free Democratic Party (FDP): 1 *Alliance '90/The Greens: 1 *Alternative for Germany (AfD): 1 *Pirate Party Germany: 1 *Independent: 3 After allegations of falsification were raised, the 2014 elections had to be held again.

According to Manetho, he was the throne successor of king Bikheris, but according to archaeological evidence he rather was the successor of king Khafre. Africanus (from Syncellus) reports as rulers of the fourth dynasty S√¥ris, Suphis I, Suphis II, Mencher√™s, Ratois√™s, Bicheris, Sebercher√™s, and Thamphthis in this order.http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Manetho/home.html Menkaure became famous for his tomb, the Pyramid of Menkaure, at Giza and his beautiful statue triads, showing the king together with his wives Rekhetre and Khamerernebty and with various deities. Family Menkaure was the son of Khafra and the grandson of Khufu. A flint knife found in the mortuary temple of Menkaure mentioned a king's mother Khamerernebty I, suggesting that Khafra and this queen were the parents of Menkaure. Menkaure is thought to have had at least two wives. * Queen Khamerernebty II is the daughter of Khamerernebti I and the mother of a king's son Khuenre. The location of Khuenre's tomb suggests that he was a son of Menkaure, making his mother the wife of this king.Grajetzki, Ancient Egyptian Queens: A Hieroglyphic Dictionary, Golden House Publications, London, 2005, p13-14 Tyldesley, Joyce. Chronicle of the Queens of Egypt. Thames & Hudson. 2006. * Queen Rekhetre is known to have been a daughter of Khafra and as such the most likely identity of her husband is Menkaure. Not many children are attested for Menkaure: * Khuenre was the son of queen Khamerernebti II. Menkaure was not succeeded by Prince Khuenre, his eldest son, who predeceased Menkaure, but rather by Shepseskaf, a younger son of this king.Clayton, pp.57-58 * Shepseskaf was the successor to Menkaure and likely his son. * Sekhemre is known from a statue and possibly a son of Menkaure. * A daughter who died in early adulthood is mentioned by Herodotus. She was placed at a superbly decorated hall of the palatial area at Sais, in a hollow gold layered wooden zoomorphic burial feature in the shape of a kneeling cow covered externally with a layer of red decoration except the neck area and the horns that were covered with adequate layers of gold.Herodotus, Historia, B:129-132 *Khentkaus I ‚Äì possible Menkaure's daughterHassan, Selim: Excavations at G√Æza IV. 1932‚Äì1933. Cairo: Government Press, Bul√¢q, 1930. pp 18-62 The royal court included several of Menkaure's half brothers. His brothers Nebemakhet, Duaenre, Nikaure, and Iunmin served as viziers during the reign of their brother. His brother Sekhemkare may have been younger than he was and became vizier after the death of Menkaure.Porter, Bertha and Moss, Rosalind, Topographical Bibliography of Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphic Texts, Statues, Reliefs and Paintings Volume III: Memphis, Part I Abu Rawash to Abusir. 2nd edition (revised and augmented by Dr Jaromir Malek, 1974). Retrieved from gizapyramids.org  Reign  Menkaura flanked by the goddess Hathor (left) and the goddess Bat (right). Graywacke statue in Cairo Museum. The length of Menkaure's reign is uncertain. The ancient historian Manetho credits him with rulership of 63 years, but this is surely an exaggeration. The Turin Canon is damaged at the spot where it should present the full sum of years, but the remains allow a reconstruction of \\"..?.. + 8 years of rulership\\". Egyptologists think that 18-year rulership was meant to be written, which is generally accepted. A contemporary workmen's graffito reports about the \\"year after the 11th cattle count\\". If the cattle count was held every second year (as was tradition at least up to king Sneferu), Menkaure might have ruled for 22 years.Miroslav Verner: Archaeological Remarks on the 4th and 5th Dynasty Chronology. In: Archiv Orient√°ln√≠, Vol. 69. Prague 2001, page 363‚Äì418.

This pyramid is the smallest of the three main pyramids at Giza. This pyramid measures at the base and in height. There are three subsidiary pyramids associated with Menkaure's pyramid. These other pyramids are sometimes labeled G-IIIa (East subsidiary pyramid), G-IIIb (Middle subsidiary pyramid) and G-IIIc (West subsidiary pyramid). In the chapel associated with G-IIIa a statue of a queen was found. It is possible that these pyramids were meant for the queens of Khafra. It may be that Khamerernebti II was buried in one of the pyramids. =Valley temple= The Valley temple was a mainly brick built structure that was enlarged in the fifth or sixth Dynasty. From this temple come the famous statues of Menkaure with his queen and Menkaure with several deities. A partial list includes: * Nome triad, Hathor-Mistress-of-the-Sycomore seated, and King and Hare-nome goddess standing, greywacke, in Boston Mus. 09.200. * Nome triad, King, Hathor-Mistress-of-the-Sycomore and Theban nome-god standing, greywacke.

An interesting find is a fragment of a wand from Queen Khamerernebty I. The piece is now in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Khamerernebti is given the title King's Mother on the fragment. =Sarcophagus= In 1837, English army officer Richard William Howard Vyse, and engineer John Shae Perring began excavations within the pyramid of Menkaure. In the main burial chamber of the pyramid they found a large stone sarcophagus long, in width, and in height, made of basalt. The sarcophagus was not inscribed with hieroglyphs although it was decorated in the style of palace facade. Adjacent to the burial chamber were found wooden fragments of a coffin bearing the name of Menkaure and a partial skeleton wrapped in a coarse cloth. The sarcophagus was removed from the pyramid and was sent by ship to the British Museum in London, but the merchant ship Beatrice carrying it was lost after leaving port at Malta on October 13, 1838. The other materials were sent by a separate ship, and those materials now reside at the museum, with the remains of the wooden coffin case on display. It is now thought that the coffin was a replacement made during the much later Saite period, nearly two millennia after the king's original interment. Radio carbon dating of the bone fragments that were found, place them at an even later date, from the Coptic period in the first centuries AD.Boughton, Paul \\"Menkaura's Anthropoid Coffin: A Case of Mistaken Identity?\\" Ancient Egypt. August/September 2006. p.30-32. Records from later periods According to Herodotus, Menkaure was the son of Khufu (Greek Cheops), and that he alleviated the suffering his father's reign had caused the inhabitants of ancient Egypt. Herodotus adds that he suffered much misfortune: his only daughter, whose corpse was interred in a wooden bull (which Herodotus claims survived to his lifetime), died before him; additionally, the oracle at Buto predicted he would only rule six years, but through his shrewdness, Menkaure was able to rule a total of 12 years and foil the prophecy (Herodotus, Histories, 2.129-133). Trivia * Menkaure was the subject of a poem by the nineteenth century English poet Matthew Arnold, entitled \\"Mycerinus\\". * Menkaure, using the Greek version of his name, Mencheres, is a major character in the Night Huntress series of books by Jeaniene Frost, depicted as an extremely old and powerful vampire living in modern times. He is a protagonist of one book in the series.

Biography G√ºnter Blobel was born in Waltersdorf in the Prussian Province of Lower Silesia, then located in eastern Germany. In January 1945 his family fled from native Silesia to Dresden to escape from the advancing Red Army. During the bombing of Dresden, Blobel, then 8, stayed with his family at a relative's farm to the west of the city. After the war, Blobel grew up and attended gymnasium in the Saxon town of Freiberg. He studied medicine and graduated from the University of T√ºbingen in 1960. After two years service in a medical internship, he moved to Madison, Wisconsin, following an older brother, enrolling in the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison and, joining the lab of Van R. Potter for his graduate work. Blobel matriculated in 1967 with a Ph.D., then took up a professorship in microbiology at the University. Blobel was appointed to the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in 1986. Blobel was awarded the 1999 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of signal peptides. Signal peptides form an integral part of protein targeting, a mechanism for cells to direct newly synthesized protein molecules to their proper location by means of an \\"address tag\\" (i.e., a signal peptide) within the molecule. Blobel died of cancer in Manhattan at New York-Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center on February 18, 2018 at the age of 81. By the time of his death, Blobel was described as having \\"ushered cell biology into the molecular age\\" through his work on the fractionation and reconstitution of functional protein complexes and sub-cellular components in vitro. Philanthropy Blobel became well known for his direct and active support for the rebuilding of Dresden in Germany, becoming, in 1994, the founder and president of the nonprofit \\"Friends of Dresden, Inc.\\" He donated all of the Nobel award money to the restoration of Dresden, in particular for the rebuilding of the Frauenkirche (completed in 2005) and the building of a new synagogue. In Leipzig he pursued a rebuilding of the Paulinerkirche, the university church of the University of Leipzig, which had been blown up by the communist regime of East Germany in 1968, arguing \\"this is a shrine of German cultural history, connected to the most important names in German cultural history.\\"Perils of Paulinerkirche / Leipzig Debates Bid to Rebuild Church Razed by Communists National Public Radio 22 June 2003 Personal life Blobel lost his older sister to aerial bombing of a train she was on in 1945, shortly after the bombing of Dresden, while an older brother survived the war and became a veterinarian in the United States.

Among its applications, it afforded insight into regression to the mean or \\"regression to mediocrity\\". Description The Galton Board consists of a vertical board with interleaved rows of pegs. Beads are dropped from the top and, when the device is level, bounce either left or right as they hit the pegs. Eventually they are collected into bins at the bottom, where the height of bead columns accumulated in the bins approximate a bell curve. Overlaying Pascal's triangle onto the pins shows the number of different paths that can be taken to get to each bin. Large-scale working models of this device created by Charles and Ray Eames can be seen in the Mathematica: A World of Numbers... and Beyond exhibits permanently on view at the Boston Museum of Science, the New York Hall of Science, or the Henry Ford Museum. Another large-scale version is displayed in the lobby of Index Fund Advisors in Irvine, California. Bean machines can be constructed for other distributions by changing the shape of the pins or biasing them towards one direction (even bimodal bean machines are possible.Brehmer et al 2018, \\"Mining gold from implicit models to improve likelihood-free inference\\": \\"Simulator Mining Example\\" A bean machine for the log-normal distribution (common in many natural processes, particularly biological ones), which uses isosceles triangles of varying widths to 'multiply' the distance the bead travels instead of fixed sizes steps which would 'sum', was constructed by Jacobus Kapteyn while studying and popularizing the statistics of the log-normal in order to help visualize it & demonstrate its plausibility.Kapteyn 1903, Skew frequency curves in biology and statistics v1; Kapteyn & van Uven 1916, Skew frequency curves in biology and statistics v2 As of 1963, it was preserved in the University of Groningen.Aitchison & Brown 1963, The Lognormal Distribution, with Special Reference to its Uses in Economics An improved log-normal bean machine, using skewed triangles, which avoids shifting the median of the beads to the left.Limpert et al 2001, \\"Log-normal Distributions across the Sciences: Keys and Clues\\" Distribution of the beads If a bead bounces to the right k times on its way down (and to the left on the remaining pegs) it ends up in the kth bin counting from the left. Denoting the number of rows of pegs in a Galton Board by n, the number of paths to the kth bin on the bottom is given by the binomial coefficient {n\\\\choose k}. Note that the leftmost bin is the 0-bin, next to it is the 1-bin, etc. and the furthest one to the right is the n-bin - making thus the total number of bins equal to n+1 (each row does not need to have more pegs than the number that identifies the row itself, e.g. the first row has 1 peg, the second 2 pegs, until the n-th row that has n pegs which correspond to the n+1 bins). If the probability of bouncing right on a peg is p (which equals 0.5 on an unbiased level machine) the probability that the ball ends up in the kth bin equals {n\\\\choose k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}. This is the probability mass function of a binomial distribution. The number of rows correspond to the size of a binomial distribution in number of trials, while the probability p of each pin is the binomial's p. According to the central limit theorem (more specifically, the de Moivre‚ÄìLaplace theorem), the binomial distribution approximates the normal distribution provided that the number of rows and the number of balls are both large. Varying the rows will result in different standard deviations or widths of the bell-shaped curve or the normal distribution in the bins.

He eloquently described this relationship in his book Natural Inheritance (1889): > Order in Apparent Chaos: I know of scarcely anything so apt to impress the > imagination as the wonderful form of cosmic order expressed by the Law of > Frequency of Error.

He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1910 for his work in determining the chemical composition of nucleic acids, the genetic substance of biological cells. Kossel isolated and described the five organic compounds that are present in nucleic acid: adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil. These compounds were later shown to be nucleobases, and are key in the formation of DNA and RNA, the genetic material found in all living cells. Kossel was an important influence on and collaborator with other important researchers in biochemistry, including Henry Drysdale Dakin, Friedrich Miescher, Edwin B. Hart, and his professor and mentor, Felix Hoppe-Seyler. Kossel was editor of the Zeitschrift f√ºr Physiologische Chemie (Journal of Physiological Chemistry) from 1895 until his death. Kossel also conducted important research into the composition of protein, and his research predicted the discovery of the polypeptide nature of the protein molecule. The Albrecht Kossel Institute for Neuroregeneration at the University of Rostock is named in his honor. Early life and education Kossel was born in Rostock, Germany as the son of the merchant and Prussian consul Albrecht Karl Ludwig Enoch Kossel and his wife Clara Jeppe Kossel. As a youth, Kossel attended the Gymnasium at Rostock, where he evidenced substantial interest in chemistry and botany. In 1872, Kossel attended the University of Strassburg to study medicine. He studied under Felix Hoppe-Seyler, who was head of the department of biochemistry, the only such institution in Germany at the time. He attended lectures by Anton de Bary, Waldeyer, August Kundt, and Baeyer. He completed his studies at University of Rostock, and passed his German medical license exam in 1877. Early research and collaboration After completing his university studies, Kossel returned to the University of Strassburg as research assistant to Felix Hoppe-Seyler. At the time, Hoppe-Seyler was intensely interested in research concerning an acidic substance that had first been chemically isolated from pus cells by one of his former students, Friedrich Miescher, in 1869. Unlike protein, the substance contained considerable amounts of phosphorus, but with its high acidity, it was unlike any cellular substance that had yet been observed. Kossel showed that the substance, called \\"nuclein\\", consisted of a protein component and a non- protein component. Kossel further isolated and described the non-protein component. This substance has become known as nucleic acid, which contains the genetic information found in all living cells. Isolation and description of nucleobases In 1883, Kossel left Strassburg to become Director of the Chemistry Division of the Physiological Institute at the University of Berlin. In this post, he succeeded Eugen Baumann and worked under the supervision of Emil du Bois-Reymond. Kossel continued his previous work on the nucleic acids. During the period 1885 to 1901, he was able to isolate and name its five constituent organic compounds: adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil. These compounds are now known collectively as nucleobases, and they provide the molecular structure necessary in the formation of stable DNA and RNA molecules. Research into the chemical composition of protein In 1895, Kossel was professor of physiology as well as director of the Physiological Institute at the University of Marburg. Around this time, he began investigations into the chemical composition of proteins, the alterations in proteins during transformation into peptone, the peptide components of cells, and other investigations. In 1896, Kossel discovered histidine, then worked out the classical method for the quantitative separation of the \\"hexone bases\\" (the alpha-amino acids arginine, histidine, and lysine). He was also the first to isolate theophylline, a therapeutic drug found naturally in tea and cocoa beans. Kossel determined its structure and its relation to caffeine. Kossel was 1901-1924 Professor of physiology as well as director of the Physiological Institute at Heidelberg University, and 1924 became director at the Institute for Protein Research at Heidelberg, which was part of the laboratory of the Medical Clinic. Kossel had helped to found it as the gift of a manufacturer. His research predicted the discovery of the polypeptide nature of the protein molecule. Nobel prize Kossel was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1910 for his research in cell biology, the chemical composition of the cell nucleus, and for his work in isolating and describing nucleic acids. The award was presented on 10 December 1910. In the autumn of 1911, Kossel was invited to the United States to deliver the Herter Lecture at Johns Hopkins. Traveling with his wife Luise and daughter Gertrude, he took the opportunity to travel and to visit acquaintances, one of which was Eugene W. Hilgard, professor emeritus of agricultural chemistry at the University of California at Berkeley, who was also his wife's cousin. He also visited and delivered lectures at several other universities, including the University of Chicago. On the occasion of his visit to New York City, Kossel was interviewed by a reporter from The New York Times. Kossel's English was reportedly very good, and his self-effacing modesty is voluminously mentioned in the reporter's account. His Herter lecture at Johns Hopkins was titled, \\"The Proteins\\". This was the only time Kossel ever visited the United States. Later research and collaboration With his distinguished English pupil Henry Drysdale Dakin, Kossel investigated arginase, the ferment which hydrolyses arginine into urea and ornithine. Later, he discovered agmatine in herring roe and devised a method for preparing it. Another of Kossel's students was American biochemist Edwin B. Hart, who would later return to the United States to participate in the \\"Single-grain experiment\\" (1907‚Äì1911) and be part of research teams that would determine the nutritive causes of anemia and goiter. Another was Otto Folin, an American chemist who discovered Phosphocreatine. In 1923, Kossel was honored by being named Germany's representative to the Eleventh Physiological Congress in Edinburgh, Scotland. When he appeared before the assembled scientists, they gave him an ovation that lasted several minutes. At the congress, he was conferred an honorary degree by the University of Edinburgh. In 1924, Kossel became professor emeritus, but continued to lecture at Heidelberg University. In April 1927, he attended the Lister Centenary Celebration held in England. During the last years of Kossel's life, he conducted important research into the composition of the protein types protamines and histones, and introduced flavianic acid for the quantitative separation of arginine, histidine and lysine in proteins. A monograph describing this work was published shortly after his death. Zeitschrift f√ºr Physiologische Chemie Kossel contributed to early issues of the Zeitschrift f√ºr Physiologische Chemie (Journal of Physiological Chemistry). This publication was founded by his professor and mentor, Felix Hoppe-Seyler, in 1877, the same year that Kossel started work as his research assistant. After Hoppe-Seyler's death in 1895, Kossel took over editorship of the Zeitschrift and continued in that role until his own death in 1927. Personal life Kossel's grave in Heidelberg In 1886, Kossel married Luise Holtzman, daughter of Adolf Holtzmann. Holtzmann was Professor at the University of Heidelberg, lecturing in German literature as well as Sanskrit. He was also a noted philologist of his day. The couple had three children, two of whom survived to maturity: Walther, born in 1888, and daughter Gertrude, born in 1889. Son Walther Kossel (1888‚Äì1956) became a prominent physicist and was professor of theoretical physics and director of the Physics Institute at the University of T√ºbingen. He is known for his theory of the chemical bond (ionic bond/octet rule), the Sommerfeld‚ÄìKossel displacement law, and other achievements. Albrecht Kossel was apparently not greatly interested in politics, but in 1914 he did not sign the propaganda Pronunciamento of German professors at the start of the war. He suffered under the lies which filled the world in war time. In 1917 Kossel was summoned by the government to pronounce that the allotted food provisions were sufficient. He refused this demand, would never declare untruths as truths Through his marriage to Luise, Kossel was related to several prominent Americans, including soil science pioneer Eugene W. Hilgard, journalist and financier Henry Villard, and abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison. Luise Kossel died in 1913 of acute pancreatitis. Kossel died quietly on 5 July 1927, after a recurring attack of angina pectoris. He is buried in Heidelberg, Germany. Legacy Albrecht Kossel is considered one of the great scientists of biochemistry and genetics. By isolating and defining nucleic acid and the nucleobases, he provided the necessary precursors that led to the double-helix model of DNA, devised by James D. Watson and Francis Crick in 1953. \\" ‚Ä¶ his elucidation of the chemical nature of some building blocks that make up nucleic acids and chromatine has secured immortality for this exeedingly modest and almost shy man.\\" The Albrecht Kossel Institute for Neuroregeneration at the University of Rostock is named in his honor.

The surviving part is a Grade I listed building. The property is currently occupied by New Hall School.  History  Beaulieu in 1669 from Count Magalotti The estate on which it was built ‚Äì the manor of Walhfare in Boreham ‚Äì was granted to the Canons of Waltham Abbey in 1062.Charter of 1062 ref: S 1036 After various changes of possession, it was granted by the Crown to Thomas Butler, 7th Earl of Ormond in 1491. By this time, it had a house called New Hall. Entry for New Hall in the English Heritage List at Grade I In 1516, New Hall was sold by Thomas Boleyn, father of Anne Boleyn, to King Henry VIII for ¬£1,000. The king rebuilt the house in brick at a cost of ¬£17,000.Maurice Howard, The Early Tudor Country House: Architecture and politics 1490-1550 (George Philip 1987), p.205. He gave his new palace the name Beaulieu, meaning \\"beautiful place\\" in French. The name expressed Henry's desire for fine things, though the name change did not outlast the century. On 23 July 1527 Henry's court arrived at Beaulieu on his summer progress, staying, unusually, for over a month in the company of a large number of nobles and their wives, including Anne Boleyn's father who had been created Viscount Rochford, the Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, the Marquess of Exeter, the Earls of Oxford, Essex, and Rutland, and Viscount Fitzwalter. It was here that Henry devised a scheme to allow him to cohabit with his intended successor of Queen Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, by obtaining a Papal bull that declared Henry's marriage to Catherine invalid, effectively allowing him to commit bigamy by claiming he was technically unmarried in the first place. This plan was dropped when Cardinal Wolsey discovered the plan, though Pope Clement VII did, in fact, issue a bull to the same effect that December.Retha M. Warnicke, The Rise And Fall of Anne Boleyn: Family Politics at the Court of Henry VIII (Cambridge University Press 1989). In October 1533, the daughter of Queen Catherine, Mary, who had been staying at Beaulieu for some time, was evicted, as the king had recently granted the palace to George Boleyn (Anne Boleyn's brother). George had been a keeper at Beaulieu when the palace was in the hands of the king. The royal inventory of 1547 noted 29 great beds, four bathing rooms with wooden floors and beds set in the wall, and a library with 37 titles.Starkey, David, ed., The Inventory of Henry VIII, vol. 1, Society of Antiquaries, (1998), 341-343. After Anne Boleyn was beheaded and Henry married Jane Seymour, he was convinced by his new wife to bring his daughters back to court. In 1537, when Queen Jane died after giving birth to a son, Edward, Mary, Henry's eldest daughter was made godmother to her half-brother Edward and acted as chief mourner at the Queen's funeral. Henry granted her a household and Mary was permitted to reside in royal palaces. Her privy purse expenses for nearly the whole of this period have been published and show that Hatfield Palace, the Palace of Beaulieu (also called New Hall), Richmond, and Hunsdon were among her principal places of residence. Queen Elizabeth I granted the estate in 1573 to Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex, who seems to have largely rebuilt the north wing. It is not known though whether he rebuilt other parts of the palace; a fire had occurred in Henry VIII's time and the palace could have been mostly rebuilt then. Soon after the north range was completed, Thomas installed Elizabeth's coat of arms above the main entrance which is still visible today. In 1622, Robert Radcliffe, 5th Earl of Sussex, sold it to George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham for ¬£30,000. During the English Civil War, Oliver Cromwell took possession of the estate for the sum of five shillings. After reverting to the 2nd Duke of Buckingham at the Restoration, it was sold to George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle, and the court of King Charles II was frequently entertained there. Cosimo de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, visited in 1669 and a member of his retinue produced a view of the house. A copy of this view was published in 1821.New Hall in 1669 - a view by Magalotti The surviving north wing, now occupied by New Hall School Benjamin Hoare acquired the property in 1713, but it was in a poor state when purchased in 1737 by John Olmius, elevated to the peerage as Baron Waltham in 1762, who demolished and rebuilt much of the former palace. The north wing was left largely untouched and forms the present house. John was succeeded in 1762 by his son Drigue who died childless in 1787, aged 40, when New Hall devolved on his sister, the Honourable Elizabeth. However, she died the same year and her husband John Luttrell, later the Earl of Carhampton, took on the Olmius name; but, already owning the Carhampton estate including Painshill, he sold New Hall in 1798. The purchasers in 1798 were the English nuns of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, who opened a Catholic school there the following year. New Hall School remains a school to this day. The Royal Arms of Henry VIII are in the school chapel. In 2006 a book, New Hall and its School, was published by Tony Tuckwell. The Beaulieu name is now remembered in the name of the nearby housing estate, Beaulieu Park, Boreham. In February 2009, Channel 4's Time Team visited and excavated the grounds of the former palace. The special programme was broadcast on 13 April 2009.

Head lice are wingless insects that spend their entire lives on the human scalp and feeding exclusively on human blood. Humans are the only known hosts of this specific parasite, while chimpanzees host a closely related species, Pediculus schaeffi. Other species of lice infest most orders of mammals and all orders of birds, as well as other parts of the human body. Lice differ from other hematophagic ectoparasites such as fleas in spending their entire lifecycle on a host. Head lice cannot fly, and their short, stumpy legs render them incapable of jumping, or even walking efficiently on flat surfaces. The non-disease-carrying head louse differs from the related disease-carrying body louse (Pediculus humanus humanus) in preferring to attach eggs to scalp hair rather than to clothing. The two subspecies are morphologically almost identical, but do not normally interbreed, although they will do so in laboratory conditions. From genetic studies, they are thought to have diverged as subspecies about 30,000‚Äì110,000 years ago, when many humans began to wear a significant amount of clothing. A much more distantly related species of hair-clinging louse, the pubic or crab louse (Pthirus pubis), also infests humans. It is visually different from the other two species and is much closer in appearance to the lice which infest other primates. Lice infestation of any part of the body is known as pediculosis. Head lice (especially in children) have been, and still are, subject to various eradication campaigns. Unlike body lice, head lice are not the vectors of any known diseases. Except for rare secondary infections that result from scratching at bites, head lice are harmless, and they have been regarded by some as essentially a cosmetic rather than a medical problem. Head lice infestations may be beneficial in helping to foster a natural immune response against lice which helps humans in defense against the far more dangerous body louse, which is capable of transmission of dangerous diseases. Adult morphology Head louse crawling on hairbrush showing how tiny it is Like other insects of the suborder Anoplura, adult head lice are small (2.5‚Äì3 mm long), dorsoventrally flattened (see anatomical terms of location), and entirely wingless. The thoracic segments are fused, but otherwise distinct from the head and abdomen, the latter being composed of seven visible segments. Head lice are grey in general, but their precise color varies according to the environment in which they were raised. After feeding, consumed blood causes the louse body to take on a reddish color. =Head= Male head louse, adult Female head louse, adult One pair of antennae, each with five segments, protrudes from the insect's head. Head lice also have one pair of eyes. Eyes are present in all species within the Pediculidae (the family of which the head louse is a member), but are reduced or absent in most other members of the Anoplura suborder. Like other members of the Anoplura, head lice mouth parts are highly adapted for piercing skin and sucking blood. These mouth parts are retracted into the insect's head except during feeding. =Thorax= Head louse gripping a human hair Six legs project from the fused segments of the thorax. As is typical in the Anoplura, these legs are short and terminate with a single claw and opposing \\"thumb\\". Between its claw and thumb, the louse grasps the hair of its host. With their short legs and large claws, lice are well adapted to clinging to the hair of their host. These adaptations leave them incapable of jumping, or even walking efficiently on flat surfaces. Lice can climb up strands of hair very quickly, allowing them to move quickly and reach another host. =Abdomen= Seven segments of the louse abdomen are visible. The first six segments each have a pair of spiracles through which the insect breathes. The last segment contains the anus and (separately) the genitalia. =Sex differences= In male lice, the front two legs are slightly larger than the other four. This specialized pair of legs is used for holding the female during copulation. Males are slightly smaller than females and are characterized by a pointed end of the abdomen and a well-developed genital apparatus visible inside the abdomen. Females are characterized by two gonopods in the shape of a W at the end of their abdomens. Eggs/nits Head louse egg (nit) attached to hair shaft of host Like most insects, head lice are oviparous. Females lay about three or four eggs per day. Louse eggs or nits, are attached near the base of a host hair shaft. Egg-laying behavior is temperature dependent and likely seeks to place the egg in a location that will be conducive to proper embryo development (which is, in turn, temperature dependent). In cool climates, eggs are generally laid within 3‚Äì5 mm of the scalp surface. In warm climates, and especially the tropics, eggs may be laid or more down the hair shaft. To attach an egg, the adult female secretes a glue from her reproductive organ. This glue quickly hardens into a \\"nit sheath\\" that covers the hair shaft and large parts of the egg except for the operculum, a cap through which the embryo breathes. The glue was previously thought to be chitin-based, but more recent studies have shown it to be made of proteins similar to hair keratin. Each egg is oval-shaped and about 0.8 mm in length. They are bright, transparent, and tan to coffee-colored so long as they contain an embryo, but appear white after hatching. Head lice hatch typically six to nine days after oviposition. After hatching, the louse nymph leaves behind its egg shell (usually known as a \\"nit\\", see below), still attached to the hair shaft. The empty egg shell remains in place until physically removed by abrasion or the host, or until it slowly disintegrates, which may take 6 or more months. The term nit refers to a louse egg or young louse. With respect to eggs, this rather broad definition includes the following: Accordingly, on the head of an infested individual, these eggs could be found: * Viable eggs that will eventually hatch * Remnants of already-hatched eggs (nits) * Nonviable eggs (dead embryo) that will never hatch This has produced some confusion in, for example, school policy (see The \\"no-nit\\" policy) because, of the three items listed above, only eggs containing viable embryos have the potential to infest or reinfest a host. Some authors have reacted to this confusion by restricting the definition of nit to describe only a hatched or nonviable egg: Louse hatching Others have retained the broad definition, while simultaneously attempting to clarify its relevance to infestation: In British and Irish slang the term \\"nit\\" is often used, across different age groups, to refer to head lice. Development and nymphs Development of Pediculus humanus humanus (body lice), which is similar to that of head lice (Pediculus humanus capitis) Head lice, like other insects of the order Phthiraptera, are hemimetabolous. Newly hatched nymphs will moult three times before reaching the sexually- mature adult stage. Thus, mobile head lice populations contain members of up to four developmental stages: three nymphal instars, and the adult (imago). Metamorphosis during head lice development is subtle. The only visible differences between different instars and the adult, other than size, is the relative length of the abdomen, which increases with each molt. Aside from reproduction, nymph behavior is similar to the adult. Nymphs feed only on human blood (hematophagia), and cannot survive long away from a host. The time required for head lice to complete their nymph development to the imago depends on feeding conditions. At minimum, eight to nine days are required for lice having continuous access to a human host. This experimental condition is most representative of head lice conditions in the wild. Experimental conditions where the nymph has more limited access to blood produces more prolonged development, ranging from 12 to 24 days. Nymph mortality in captivity is high‚Äîabout 38%‚Äîespecially within the first two days of life. In the wild, mortality may instead be highest in the third instar. Nymph hazards are numerous. Failure to completely hatch from the egg is invariably fatal and may be dependent on the humidity of the egg's environment. Death during molting can also occur, although it is reportedly uncommon. During feeding, the nymph gut can rupture, dispersing the host's blood throughout the insect. This results in death within a day or two. Whether the high mortality recorded under experimental conditions is representative of conditions in the wild is unclear. Reproduction and lifespan Copulation in Pediculus humanus humanus (Pediculus humanus capitis is similar), female is on top, with the male below. Dilation of the female's vagina has already occurred, and the male's dilator rests against his back (dorsal surface), out of the way. The male vesica, which contains the penis proper (not seen), is fully inserted into the vagina. Note the male's attachment with his specialized claws on the first leg pair to the specialized notch on the female's third leg pair. Adult head lice reproduce sexually, and copulation is necessary for the female to produce fertile eggs. Parthenogenesis, the production of viable offspring by virgin females, does not occur in Pediculus humanus. Pairing can begin within the first 10 hours of adult life. After 24 hours, adult lice copulate frequently, with mating occurring during any period of the night or day. Mating attachment frequently lasts more than an hour. Young males can successfully pair with older females, and vice versa. Experiments with P. h. humanus (body lice) emphasize the attendant hazards of lice copulation. A single young female confined with six or more males will die in a few days, having laid very few eggs. Similarly, death of a virgin female was reported after admitting a male to her confinement. The female laid only one egg after mating, and her entire body was tinged with red‚Äîa condition attributed to rupture of the alimentary canal during the sexual act. Old females frequently die following, if not during, copulation. A single louse has a 30-day lifecycle beginning from the moment the nit is laid until the adult louse dies. Factors affecting infestation The number of children per family, the sharing of beds and closets, hair washing habits, local customs and social contacts, healthcare in a particular area (e.g. school), and socioeconomic status were found to be significant factors in head louse infestation. Girls are two to four times more frequently infested than boys. Children between 4 and 14 years of age are the most frequently infested group. Behaviour =Feeding= All stages except eggs are blood-feeders and bite the skin four to five times daily to feed. They inject saliva which contains an anticoagulant and suck blood. The digested blood is excreted as dark red frass. =Position on host= Although any part of the scalp may be colonized, lice favor the nape of the neck and the area behind the ears, where the eggs are usually laid. Head lice are repelled by light and move towards shadows or dark-coloured objects in their vicinity. =Transmission= Lice have no wings or powerful legs for jumping, so they move using their claw-like legs to transfer from hair to hair. Normally, head lice infest a new host only by close contact between individuals, making social contacts among children and parent-child interactions more likely routes of infestation than shared combs, hats, brushes, towels, clothing, beds, or closets. Head-to-head contact is by far the most common route of lice transmission. Distribution About 6‚Äì12 million people, mainly children, are treated annually for head lice in the United States alone. In the UK, it is estimated that two thirds of children will experience at least one case of head lice before leaving primary school. High levels of louse infestations have also been reported from all over the world, including Australia, Denmark, France, Ireland, Israel, and Sweden. Head lice can survive off the head, for example on soft furnishings such as pillow cases, on hairbrushes, or on coat hoods for up to 48 hours. Archaeogenetics Analysis of the DNA of lice found on Peruvian mummies may indicate that some diseases (such as typhus) may have passed from the New World to the Old World, instead of the other way around. Genome The sequencing of the genome of the body louse was first proposed in the mid-2000s and the annotated genome was published in 2010. An analysis of the body and head louse transcriptomes revealed these two organisms are extremely similar genetically.  Mitochondrial clades  Human lice are divided into three deeply divergent mitochondrial clades known as A, B, and C. Two subclades have been identified, D (a sister clade of A) and E (a sister clade of C). = Clade A = * head and body: worldwide *found in ancient Roman Judea = Clade D (sister of clade A) = * head and body: Central Africa, Ethiopia, United States = Clade B = * head only: worldwide * found in ancient Roman Judea and 4,000-year-old Chilean mummy = Clade C = * head only: Ethiopia, Nepal, Thailand = Clade E (sister of clade C) = * head only: West Africa See also * Body louse * Crab louse * Delphinium * Lindane * List of parasites of humans * Nitpicking * Pediculosis * Treatment of human head lice References External links * Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Division of Parasitic Diseases * James Cook University, Australia: Head Lice Information Sheet * University of Nebraska: Head Lice Resources You Can Trust * body and head lice on the UF / IFAS Featured Creatures Web site Lice Insects described in 1767 Parasitic arthropods of humans Ectoparasites Subspecies ","title":"Head louse"},{"id":"243919","text":"Constance Mary Whitehouse (n√©e Hutcheson; 13 June 1910 ‚Äì 23 November 2001) was a British educator and conservative activist. She campaigned against social liberalism and the mainstream British media, both of which she accused of encouraging a more permissive society. She was the founder and first president of the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association, through which she led a longstanding campaign against the BBC. A hard-line social conservative, she was disparagingly termed a reactionary by her socially liberal opponents. Her motivation derived from her traditional Christian beliefs, her aversion to the rapid social and political changes in British society of the 1960s and her work as a teacher of sex education. Whitehouse became an art teacher, at the same time becoming involved in evangelical Christian groups such as the Student Christian Movement (which became increasingly more liberal leading up to, and after a 1928 split with the Universities and Colleges Christian Fellowship) and Moral Re-Armament. She became a public figure via the Clean-Up TV pressure group, established in 1964, in which she was the most prominent figure. The following year she founded the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association, using it as a platform to criticise the BBC for what she perceived as a lack of accountability, and excessive use of bad language and portrayals of sex and violence in its programmes. As a result, she was often treated as a figure of fun. During the 1970s she broadened her activities, and was a leading figure in the Nationwide Festival of Light, a Christian campaign that gained mass support for a period. She initiated a successful private prosecution against Gay News on the grounds of blasphemous libel, the first such case for more than 50 years. Another private prosecution was against the director of the play The Romans in Britain, which had been performed at the National Theatre. Whitehouse's campaigns continue to divide opinion. Her critics have accused her of being a highly censorious, bigoted figure, and her traditional moral convictions brought her into direct conflict with advocates of the sexual revolution, feminism, children's rights and LGBT rights. Others see her more positively and believe she was attempting to halt a decline in what they perceived as Britain's moral standards. According to Ben Thompson, the editor of an anthology of Whitehouse-related letters published in 2012: \\"From ... feminist anti-pornography campaigns to the executive naming and shaming strategies of UK Uncut, her ideological and tactical influence has been discernible in all sorts of unexpected places in recent years.\\"Ben Thompson \\"Ban this filth!\\" , Financial Times, 9 November 2012. This article is a reprint of the introduction to Ben Thompson (ed.) Ban This Filth!: Letters From the Mary Whitehouse Archive, London: Faber & Faber, 2012 Early life Born in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, Whitehouse was the second of four children of a \\"less-than-successful businessman\\" and a \\"necessarily resourceful mother\\".Obituary, The Times, 24 November 2001 She won a scholarship to Chester City Grammar School,Obituary, The Daily Telegraph, 24 November 2001 where she was keen on hockey and tennis, and after leaving she did two years of unpaid apprentice teaching at St John's School in Chester, Cheshire. At the Cheshire County Teacher Training College in Crewe, specialising in secondary school art teaching, she was involved with the Student Christian Movement before qualifying in 1932. She became an art teacher at Lichfield Road School in Lichfield, Staffordshire, where she stayed for eight years. She joined the Wolverhampton branch of the Oxford Group, later known as Moral Re-Armament (MRA), in 1935. At MRA meetings, she met Ernest Raymond Whitehouse; they married in 1940 and remained married until he died in Colchester, Essex, aged 87, in 2000. The couple had five sons, two of whom (twins) died in infancy.Mary Warnock \\"Whitehouse [n√©e Hutcheson], (Constance) Marywhitehouse, Mary\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography After raising her sons in their earliest years, Whitehouse returned to teaching in 1953. That year she broadcast on Woman's Hour on the day before the coronation of Elizabeth II \\"as a loyal housewife and subject\\" and wrote an extensive article on homosexuality for The Sunday Times. According to Ben Thompson this concerned how a mother might \\"best avoid inadvertently pressuring her sons towards that particular orientation\\", and gained enough attention to be republished as a pamphlet. She taught art at Madeley Modern School in Madeley, Shropshire from 1960, taking responsibility for sex education. Shocked at the moral beliefs of her pupils, she became concerned about what she and many others perceived as declining moral standards in the British media, especially in the BBC. Clean Up TV campaign and the NVALA =Beginnings= Whitehouse began her activism in 1963 with a letter to the BBCJonathan Brown \\"Mary Whitehouse: To some a crank, to others a warrior\\", The Independent, 24 November 2001 requesting to see Hugh Greene, the BBC's Director-General. Greene was out of the country at the time, so she accepted an invitation to meet Harman Grisewood, his deputy,Tracey and Morrison Whitehouse, London & Basingstoke: Macmillan, 1979, p.41 a Roman Catholic who she felt listened to her with understanding.Asa Briggs The History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom, Volume 5, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995, p.332, 334 Over the next few months though, she continued to be dissatisfied with what she saw on television. With Norah Buckland, the wife of a vicar, she launched the Clean Up TV Campaign in January 1964 with a manifesto appealing to the \\"women of Britain\\". The campaign's first public meeting, on 5 May 1964, was held in Birmingham's Town Hall.David Winter Obituary, The Independent, 24 November 2001 Richard Whitehouse, one of her sons, recalled in 2008: \\"Coaches arrived from all over the country. Two thousand people poured in and suddenly there was my mother on a podium inspiring them to rapturous applause. Her hands were shaking. But she didn't stop\\". Although he regularly clashed with Whitehouse, the academic Richard Hoggart shared some of her opinions and was present on the platform with her at this meeting.Richard Hoggart \\"Valid arguments lost in an obsession over sex\\", The Guardian, 24 November 2001. Hoggart is mistaken here in thinking he could have referred to Dennis Potter's plays on 5 May 1964, as Potter's earliest work in this form, The Confidence Course, was not transmitted until 24 February 1965. The Times commented the following day: \\"Perhaps never before in the history of the Birmingham Town Hall has such a successful meeting been sponsored by such a flimsy organisation\\".The Times, 6 May 1964, cited by Tracey and Morrison, p.44 =Sir Hugh Greene at the BBC= Greene, knighted in January 1964,Michael Tracey The Production of Political Television, London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1978, p.159 became her b√™te noire. He was, according to Whitehouse, \\"the devil incarnate\\" who \\"more than anybody else ... [was] responsible for the moral collapse in this country\\".Dennis Barker \\"Mary Whitehouse: Self-appointed campaigner against the permissive society on television\\", The Guardian, 24 November 2001 The CUTV manifesto asserted that the BBC under Greene spread \\"the propaganda of disbelief, doubt and dirt ... promiscuity, infidelity and drinking\\".Mary Whitehouse quoted by David Stubbs \\"The moral minority\\", The Guardian, 24 May 2008 In place of this, the authors argued, the Corporation's activities should \\"encourage and sustain faith in God and bring Him back to the hearts of our family and national life\\".Quoted in Dominic Sandbrook White Heat, London: Little, Brown, 2006, p.544The full manifesto is quoted by Roy Shaw in \\"Television: Freedom and Responsibility\\", New Blackfriars, no.553, June 1966, p.453 Interviewed by The Catholic Herald for its Christmas 1965 issue, Whitehouse thought the BBC loaded its programmes in favour of the 'new morality'.Ian James \\"MRS. MARY WHITEHOUSE, co-founder of the Clean-up Television Campaign\\" , Catholic Herald, 24 December 1965 She commented about one unnamed television programme, believing it to be \\"unbalanced\\" and biased, in which \\"youngsters were asking questions [and] there was not a single member of the panel who was prepared to say outright that pre-marital relations were wrong. In fact, when a girl asked a clergyman, 'Do you think that fornication is sin?' he replied, 'It depends on what you mean by sin and what you mean by fornication.'\\" Whitehouse thought it was a \\"big hazard\\" for \\"present-day children\\" that \\"so many adults do not stand for anything\\", and affirmed that it was the responsibility of the BBC to have a \\"missionary role\\" to compensate for this social deficiency. The Clean Up TV petition, using the manifesto, gained 500,000 signatures. Whitehouse complained in 1993 that during Greene's period at the BBC, \\"hardly a week went by without a sniping reference to me\\". Whitehouse's critics responded quickly. The playwright David Turner had heckled her at Birmingham Town Hall; his work was criticised during the meeting. Within a few months, an episode of Swizzlewick, a twice-weekly serial he created, featured a parody of her as Mrs Smallgood.Steve Fielding A State of Play: British Politics on Screen, Stage and Page, from Anthony Trollope to \\"The Thick of It\\"\\" , London & New York; Bloomsbury, 2014, p.136 In a speech Greene delivered in 1965, he argued, without naming Whitehouse directly, that the critics of his liberalisation of broadcasting policy would \\"attack whatever does not underwrite a set of prior assumptions\\", and saw the potential for \\"a dangerous form of censorship...which works by causing artists and writers not to take risks\\". He defended the right of the BBC \\"to be ahead of public opinion\\".Reprinted in Sir Hugh Greene The Third Floor Front: A View of Broadcasting in the Sixties, London: The Bodley Head, 1969, p.100-1 Greene ignored Whitehouse, blocked her from participation in BBC broadcasts, and purchased a painting of Whitehouse with five breasts by James Lawrence Isherwood. The National Viewers' and Listeners' Association (now known as Mediawatch-UK) was launched to succeed CUTV in November 1965, replacing what they themselves perceived as CUTV's negativity with an active campaign for legislative change.Michael Tracey and David Morrison Whitehouse, p.47 The former cabinet minister Bill Deedes, later editor of The Daily Telegraph, supported the group in this period and was the leading speaker at NVALA's founding conference in Birmingham on 30 April 1966,Thompson Ban This Filth, p.36-37 and acted as a contact between his parliamentary colleagues and Whitehouse.Stephen Robinson The Remarkable Lives Of Bill Deedes , London: Little, Brown (Hatchette Digital) 2008, p.111-12 Quintin Hogg, better known as Lord Hailsham, was another high-profile politician who gave his support to NVALA and Whitehouse at this time. Through the letters she frequently sent to Harold Wilson, the Prime Minister, Whitehouse caused particular difficulties for civil servants at 10 Downing Street.Alan Travis Bound and Gagged: A Secret History of Censorship in Britain, Profile Books, 2000, p.231-2 Reportedly, for some time Downing Street intentionally \\"lost\\" her letters to avoid having to respond to them. It has though been suggested that her contact with parliamentarians helped give her some leverage over the BBC which her own direct communication with the Corporation's executives could not achieve.Thompson Ban This Filth , p.33 Although accepting the differences between them, Whitehouse wrote to Wilson on 1 January 1968: \\"You have always treated our approaches to you seriously and with courtesy.\\"Thompson Ban This Filth , p.39 Geoffrey Robertson, QC, suggests that when Greene left the BBC in 1969, contrary to the view that it was because of disagreements over the appointment of the Conservative Lord Hill as BBC chairman in 1967, whereby she could be given some credit for his departure, it was more to do with a political struggle between the BBC and Wilson.

During his brief period as editor of Panorama (1965‚Äì66),Alan Rosenthal The New Documentary in Action: a Casebook in Film Making, Berkeley & Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1972, p.95, 96 Jeremy Isaacs received a letter from Whitehouse complaining about his decision to repeat Richard Dimbleby's coverage of the liberation of the Belsen concentration camp. She complained about this \\"filth\\" being allowed on air as \\"it was bound to shock and offend\\". In a 1994 interview, Whitehouse continued to maintain that it was \\"an awful intrusion\\" and \\"very off-putting\\".Allison Pearson \\"Television: Mary, Mary, quite contrary \\", The Independent on Sunday, 29 May 1994. The interviews with Isaacs and Whitehouse were contained within The Late Show: The Mary Whitehouse Story, which was, according to the BFI Film & TV database , transmitted on 23 May 1994. See the BFI site also for a synopsis of this programme. Later in 1965, the decision by the BBC not to broadcast Peter Watkins' The War Game on 6 August 1965 led to Whitehouse writing to Sir Hugh Greene and Harold Wilson on 5 September,Patrick Murphy and John Cook \\"The War Game\\" in Ian Aitken The Concise Routledge Encyclopedia of the Documentary Film , Abingdon & New York: Routledge, 2013 [2006], p,974 and again to the Home Secretary Frank Soskice on 6 OctoberThompson Ban This Filth , p.30 In her view a decision over whether to broadcast Watkins' film should be taken by the Home Office rather than the BBC. Nuclear war was \\"too serious a matter to be treated as entertainment. For a producer to be allowed, as now appears possible, to prejudice the effectiveness of our Civil Defence Services, or the ability of the British people to re-act with courage, initiative and control in a crisis, surely goes far beyond the responsibility\\" which should be given to someone in this role. The letter was leaked at the time and extracts were published. The contemporary coverage of the Vietnam War, \\"the first 'television war'\\",A much used description, see for example Daniel Hallin \\"Vietnam on Television\\" , The Museum of Broadcast Communications website demonstrated for Whitehouse that television was \\"an ally of pacifism\\".Mary Whitehouse 'Promoting Violence', Royal College of Nursing in the UK Professional Conference, The Violent Society, 5 April 1970, quoted in Tracey and Morrison Whitehouse, London: Macmillan, 1979, p.86-87, 205, n.27 In a 1970 speech to the Royal College of Nursing she argued: \\"However good the cause ... the horrific effects on men and terrain of modern warfare as seen on the television screen could well sap the will of a nation to safeguard its own freedom, let alone resist the forces of evil abroad.\\" Trying to reconcile this \\"pacifism\\" with her objection to fictional violence, she saw such news coverage as \\"desensitisation\\" in which the media use the \\"techniques of violence\\" to raise \\"impact\\" in order \\"to satisfy an apparently insatiable demand for realism\\". =Programmes: comedy and drama from the mid-1960s to 1980= The situation comedy Till Death Us Do Part attacked many of the things Whitehouse cherished. She objected to its profane language: \\"I doubt if many people would use 121 bloodies in half-an-hour\\", and \\"Bad language coarsens the whole quality of our life. It normalises harsh, often indecent language, which despoils our communication.\\" Whitehouse and the NVALA won a libel action against the BBC and its writer Johnny Speight in July 1967 with a full apology and substantial damages, after Speight implied in a BBC radio interview that the organisation's members and its head were fascists.\\"Damages For Mrs Mary Whitehouse\\", Glasgow Herald, 28 July 1967, p.11Mark Ward \\"A Family at War: Till Death Do Us Part\\", The Main Event (Kaleidoscope brochure) 1996 Shortly after Speight's interview, she was mocked in an episode of the series entitled \\"Alf's Dilemma\\" (27 February 1967). Alf Garnett is shown reading her book Cleaning Up TV, and agreeing with every word, but the episode ends with the book being burned to exclamations of \\"Unclean, unclean\\".Thompson Ban This Filth , p.12 Whitehouse was critical of comedians such as Benny Hill and his use of dancers; she described Dave Allen as \\"offensive, indecent and embarrassing\\" after a comic account of a conversation following sexual intercourse.Patrick Newley Obituary: Dave Allen, The Stage, 15 March 2005 In return, comedy writers during this era saw her as possessing humorous potential. The Goodies comedy team created an episode (\\"Gender Education\\", 1971) with the principal objective of irritating her. (subscription required) Whitehouse criticised the work of Dennis Potter from Son of Man (1969) onwards, arguing that the BBC was at the centre \\"of a conspiracy to remove the myth of god from the minds of men\\",Quoted by Boris Ford The Cambridge Cultural History of Britain: Modern Britain, Cambridge University Press, 1992, p.24 and also A Clockwork Orange (1971). In the case of the violence in A Clockwork Orange, she rejected any attempt to show a 'copycat' correlation in academic studies, but urged its acceptance as a fact arrived at by common sense.Michael Tracey and David Morrison Whitehouse, p.84 In December 1974, she wrote of the \\"deliberate propagation\\" of the idea that there is no proof of the effects of television on \\"standards and behaviour\\". To reject its effect, and its ability to \\"declaim or pervert truth, is to deny the potency of communication itself, it is crazily to question the ability of education to affect the social conscience and to train the human mind\\".Mary Whitehouse \\"Television: Controlling the explosive influence\\" , The Spectator, 28 December 1974, p.14. The page on the website of The Spectator contains some typographical errors, these have been corrected. Chuck Berry's novelty song \\"My Ding-a-Ling\\" was one of several pop songs to receive Whitehouse's disapproval in this period.

She described the serial Genesis of the Daleks (1975) as consisting of \\"teatime brutality for tots\\", said The Brain of Morbius (1976) \\"contained some of the sickest and most horrific material seen on children's television\\", and on The Seeds of Doom (1976), in which the Doctor (Tom Baker) survives an encounter with a giant carnivorous plant monster, she commented: \\"Strangulation‚Äîby hand, by claw, by obscene vegetable matterMary Whitehouse quoted by Dominic Sandbrook State of Emergency, The Way We Were: Britain 1970‚Äì74, London: Allen Lane, 2010, p.461-62‚Äîis the latest gimmick, sufficiently close up so they get the point.

Simon Farquhar, in an obituary for The Independent of the series' creator, Richard Carpenter, wrote that Whitehouse \\"objected to the [show's] relentless slaughter and blasphemous religious elements, but was deftly silenced by Carpenter in public when he introduced himself to her and the audience by saying \\"I'm Richard Carpenter, and I'm a professional writer.

It was originally published in Denmark where, according to Whitehouse, it had done \\"incalculable damage\\"Daily Telegraph, 29 March 1971, quote as reproduced in Tracey and Morrison, p.134 and was \\"a revolutionary primer\\",Whitehouse (1977) p.181, quoted in Tony McEnery Swearing in English: Bad Language, Purity and Power From 1586 to the Present Day, London: Routledge, 2006, p.143 in which \\"open rebellion against the 'system', be it school, parents or authority generally, was openly advocated, while children were constantly exhorted to collect evidence against teachers of alleged injustices or anything which was likely to enhance revolution.\\"Whitehouse (1977) p.180, cited in McEnery, p.143 She was \\"greatly relieved‚Äîfor the sake of the children\\" at the ¬£50 fine and ¬£115.50 costs imposed on Richard Handyside and Geoffrey Collins, its publishers,John Sutherland Offensive Literature, Junction Books, 1982, p.111, 113 who also had works by Che Guevara and Fidel Castro on their small list of publications. For Whitehouse it was a \\"fundamental right of a child to be a child\\" and \\"the duty of mature people to ensure that childhood is protected against the inroads of those who would exploit its immaturity for political, social or personal gain.\\"Letter from Mary Whitehouse , The Spectator, 6 August 1971, p.23; quoted in Tracey and Morrison, p.138 A modified second edition was allowed to be published in the UK,Joanna Moorhead \\"The Little Red Schoolbook ‚Äì honest about sex and the need to challenge authority\\" , The Guardian, 8 July 2014 but the original verdict in the prosecution was sustained in the Appeal Court and the European Court of Human Rights (see Handyside v United Kingdom). An unexpurgated edition of the book, bar one minor cut, was published in the UK during July 2014. Along with the (Catholic) Labour peer Lord Longford, Malcolm Muggeridge and Cliff Richard,Mark Duguid \\"Whitehouse, Mary (1910‚Äì2001)\\" , BFI screenonline Whitehouse was a leading figure in the Nationwide Festival of Light, which protested against the commercial exploitation of sex and violence. The Festival's mass \\"rally against permissiveness\\" in Trafalgar Square was attended by 50,000 people in September 1971. On 25 August that year she had an audience with Pope Paul VI regarding 'moral pollution', in which she attempted to present the pontiff with Oz28 and the Little Red School Book, but these items found their way to an official of the Papal See instead.Sutherland Offensive Literature, p.116 In his Foreword to Whitehouse's book, Who Does She Think She Is? (1971), Malcolm Muggeridge wrote: \\"It is literally true that but for her the total demolition of all Christian decencies and values in this country would have taken place virtually without a word of public protest.\\" Following the release on appeal of the defendants in the Oz trial, \\"an unmitigated disaster for the children of our country\\",Evening Standard, 6 November 1971, quote as reproduced in Tracey and Morrison, p.135, 207 n.6:14 Whitehouse launched the Nationwide Petition for Public Decency in January 1972, which gained 1.35 million signatures by the time it was presented to Edward Heath in April 1973.Dominic Sandbrook State of Emergency, The Way We Were: Britain 1970‚Äì74, London: Allen Lane, 2010, p.462 She had around 300 speaking engagements during the period of her highest profile. The pornographic magazine Whitehouse was launched in 1975 by publisher David Sullivan.Roy Greenslade Press Gang: How Newspapers Make Profits From Propaganda, London: Macmillan, 2004 [2003], p.490Jamie Doward \\"Top shelf gathers dust\\" , The Observer, 13 May 2001 = Opposition to paedophilia and child pornography = The Paedophile Information Exchange had been asked to help the Albany Trust, which received public money, to produce a booklet on paedophilia, which was to have been published by the Trust. Whitehouse mentioned the connection in a speech, asserting that public funds were being used to subsidise paedophile groups, and the Trust withdrew its support for the production of the pamphlet in 1977. However, PIE itself did not receive public funding. Her subsequent petition against paedophilia and child pornography was signed by 1¬Ω million people. Whitehouse urged the Conservative opposition to push for a bill on the subject, in the absence of interest from the Labour government. The private member's bill proposed by Conservative MP Cyril Townsend became the Protection of Children Act 1978. =Gay News and other cases of alleged blasphemy= Whitehouse took private prosecutions in a number of cases where official action was not forthcoming. The action against Gay News in 1977 concerned \\"The Love That Dares to Speak Its Name\\", a poem by James Kirkup, a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature,Obituary: James Kirkup, The Daily Telegraph, 12 May 2009 the theme of which was the sexual fantasies of a Roman centurion about the body of Jesus Christ. She was the plaintiff in a charge of blasphemous libel against Gay News (Whitehouse v Lemon), a trial at the Old Bailey between 4 and 7 July 1977. It was the first prosecution for the offence since 1922. \\"I simply had to protect Our Lord,\\" said Whitehouse at the time,Corinna Adam \\"Protecting Our Lord\\", New Statesman, 15 July 1977, in a version republished 3 February 2006 Kirkup's poem being in her opinion \\"the recrucifixion of Christ by 20th-century weapons\\". (subscription required) The prosecution counsel John Smyth, representing Whitehouse, told the jury: \\"It may be said that this is a love poem‚Äîit is not, it is a poem about buggery\\", while the defence case was that the poem suggested all of mankind could love Jesus Christ. The Archbishop of Canterbury Donald Coggan and Cardinal Basil Hume both declined Whitehouse's invitation for them to give evidence at the trial.Tracey & Morrison, p.12 Denis Lemon, the editor and owner of Gay News, published the poem in the 3‚Äì16 June 1976 issueTracey & Morrison Whitehouse, p.3 on the basis that the \\"message and intention of the poem was to celebrate the absolute universality of God's love\\".Peter Burton Obituary: Denis Lemon, The Independent, 23 July 1994 Whitehouse told Michael Tracey and David Morrison, the authors of a book about her: \\"I think it shook me more than anything I had seen or come into contact with all the time I had been campaigning. ... I don't think Jesus Christ has ever been more real to me as a person than he was at that particular moment.\\" Gay News lost the case; the jury decided the case on a 10‚Äì2 majority. Lemon and his paper were fined, and Lemon received a nine-month suspended prison sentence. A Guardian editorial after the verdict said of the trial: \\"No evidence was called, or allowed to be called, about the merits of the poem in literature or theology\\", despite the case concerning blasphemy, or to suggest that Kirkup's intention had been to \\"scandalise\\" which, given the poet's \\"list of serious works\\", the newspaper thought should have been proven.Editorial \\"From the archive, 13 July 1977: Editorial: Is the law on blasphemy still relevant?\\" , The Guardian, 13 July 2012 (reprint) The judge in at the prosecution, Alan King-Hamilton, QC, had only allowed novelist Margaret Drabble and journalist Bernard Levin to appear as \\"character\\" witnesses for the newspaper. The Spectator editorial on 15 July commented: \\"The prosecution was perverse, the verdict misguided. As for the punishments, given that this was in effect a test case, they are excessive\\" and \\"left the law on obscenity even more muddled and confused than it was before, and have served no useful purpose whatsoever, except to delight Mrs Whitehouse\\".\\"Bad news\\" , The Spectator, 15 July 1977, p.3 The Court of Appeal and the House of Lords dismissed appeals, although Lemon's sentence was overturned. Geoffrey Robertson, QC, the barrister for Gay News in the case, described Whitehouse as homophobic in The Times in 2008, saying: \\"Her fear of homosexuals was visceral\\". He describes the beliefs she reveals in her book, Whatever Happened to Sex?, as \\"nonsense\\", such as her assertion that \\"homosexuality was caused by abnormal parental sex 'during pregnancy or just after'\\", saying that for her, \\"being gay was like having acne: 'Psychiatric literature proves that 60 per cent of homosexuals who go for treatment get completely cured'\\". Whitehouse had hoped to use the blasphemy laws against material other than Kirkup's poem, and was interested in pursuing a possible action against allegedly blasphemous content for some time.Tracey & Morrison Whitehouse, p.4-5 She had hoped that it could be used as a basis for prosecution if a planned pornographic film on the life of Jesus Christ had been made in Britain. The intended work, containing both homosexual and heterosexual content, was a project by the Danish filmmaker Jens J√∏rgen Thorsen. This time Whitehouse, whose organisation had commissioned a translation of the script, gained more widespread support.Tracey & Morrison Whitehouse, p.11 NVALA organised a publicity campaign,Sutherland Offensive Litearure, p.149-50 which resulted in Thorsen's intentions gaining significant public condemnation in September 1976 from leading public figures, including the Queen.John Horton and Susan Mendus (eds.) Aspects of Toleration: Philosophical Studies , Abingdon: Routledge, 1985 [2010], p.24 Jensen was forced to abandon his plans. Whitehouse and a letter writing campaign from the Festival of Light, after unsuccessfully lobbying the British Board of Film Classification to refuse the film a certificate, were successful in persuading some councils in Britain to ban screenings of Monty Python's Life of Brian (1979) in their areas on unproven grounds that the film is blasphemous. Nearly a decade later, a threatened campaign by Whitehouse against Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), with the law against blasphemy still in force at the time, failed to materialise. =The Romans in Britain= In 1982 she pursued a private prosecution against Michael Bogdanov, the director of a National Theatre production of Howard Brenton's The Romans in Britain, a play that \\"drew a direct parallel between the Roman invasion of Celtic Britain in 54 BC and the contemporary British presence in Northern Ireland\\".Michael Billington State of the Nation: British Theatre Since 1945, London: Faber, 2007, p.305-6 The first act contains \\"a brief scene\\" of (simulated) anal rape‚Äîthe Police had visited the production three times and found no basis for legal action.Howard Brenton \\"Look back in anger\\", The Guardian, 28 January 2006 In the prosecution Whitehouse's counsel claimed Section 13 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956, which described the offence of \\"procuring an act of gross indecency\\",Mark Lawson \\"Passion play\\", The Guardian, 28 October 2005 was applicable. Because this was a general Act, there was no possibility of defence on the basis of artistic merit, unlike that permitted under the Obscene Publications Act 1959. Since Whitehouse had not seen the play, the prosecution evidence rested on the testimony of her solicitor, Graham Ross- Cornes, who claimed he saw the actor's penis. However, cross-examination revealed that he had seen a performance of the play from the back row of the stalls, 90 feet from the stage.Robertson The Justice Game , p.177 Lord Hutchinson, counsel for Bogdanov, was able to demonstrate the nature of the illusion performed on stage. This was achieved by suggesting that it might have been the actor's thumb protruding from his fist, rather than his erect penis. The defence had argued that the Act did not apply to the theatre; the judge Mr Justice Staughton then ruled that it did. After three days, the action was withdrawn after the prosecution counsel told Whitehouse that he was unable to continue with the case; the litigation was ended by the Attorney General putting forward a plea of nolle prosequi. (subscription required) Both sides claimed a victory; Whitehouse's side asserted that the important legal point had been made with the ruling on the applicability of the Sexual Offences Act, while Bogdanov said it was because she knew that he would not be convicted. Whitehouse had to meet ¬£20,000 costs, most of which was paid by an anonymous donor. Whitehouse's account of the trial is recorded in A Most Dangerous Woman (); she wrote that she was of the opinion that the legal point had been established, and they had no wish to criminalise Bogdanov, the play's director. =Margaret Thatcher's government= By the 1980s, Whitehouse had found a powerful ally in the Conservative government, particularly in Margaret Thatcher herself, whose support base partially consisted of Christians and social conservatives. It has been claimed by the Conservative journalist Bruce Anderson that the market orientation of the Thatcher government prejudiced it against Whitehouse in private.Bruce Anderson \\"A life spent trying in vain to preserve the suburban idyll\\", The Independent, 26 November 2001 It has been claimed by commentators not necessarily in agreement with her that Whitehouse's efforts played a part in the passage of the Protection of Children Act 1978, the Indecent Displays (Control) Act 1981, which concerned sex shops, and the Video Recordings Act 1984, which banned 'video nasties'. A term reportedly coined by Whitehouse,Andrew Holmes \\"Let there be blood\\" , The Guardian, 5 July 2002 she screened edited highlights from these films for MPs at the House of Commons in late 1983,Richard Stanley \\"Dying Light: An Obituary for the Great British Horror Movie\\" in Steve Chibnall and Julian Petley (eds.) British Horror Cinema, London: Routledge, 2002, p.184 which included extracts from The Evil Dead (1981) considered by her \\"the number one nasty\\". It was \\"a highly effective means of lobbying the government to introduce tight state controls on the burgeoning video industry\\". Around 1986, papers released in late December 2014 indicate, Whitehouse met with Thatcher on at least two occasions to discuss the possibility of banning sex toys using a potential extension of the \\"deprave and corrupt\\" provision in the Obscene Publications Act 1959.Ben Tufft \\"Thatcher wanted to ban sex toys using anti-pornography laws after pressure from campaigners\\" , The Independent, 30 December 2014 The plan was abandoned because home secretary Leon Brittan thought the concept of public taste would be a problematic concept for legal action.Natasha Hinde \\"Sex Toys V Margaret Thatcher: The Iron Lady Wanted To Ban Them Under Obscenity Laws\\" , The Huffington Post, 31 December 2014 Later years and assessments of her influence Whitehouse was appointed a CBE in 1980. In 1988, she suffered a spinal injury in a fall, which severely curbed her campaigning activities. Whitehouse retired as president of the NVALA in 1994. She died, aged 91, in a nursing home in Colchester, Essex, on 23 November 2001. Whitehouse is buried in the churchyard of the parish church of St Mary the Virgin at Dedham in Essex. The grave of Mary Whitehouse's husband, Ernest Raymond Whitehouse The journalist Mary Kenny believes \\"Mary Whitehouse was a significant figure. Some of her battles were justified, even prophetic. Today her attacks on 'kiddie porn' would be widely supported.\\"Mary Kenny \\"In defence of Mary Whitehouse\\", The Spectator (blog), 10 June 2010 The academic Richard Hoggart observed: \\"her main focus was on sex, followed by bad language and violence. Odd: if she had reversed the order, she might have been more effective.\\" Writing in the Dictionary of National Biography, the philosopher Mary Warnock opined, \\"Even if her campaigning did not succeed in 'cleaning up TV', still less in making it more fit to watch in other ways, she was of serious intent, and was an influence for good at a crucial stage in the development both of the BBC and of ITV. She was not, as the BBC seemed officially to proclaim, a mere figure of fun.\\" The papers of the NVALA for 1970‚Äì1990 have been deposited at the LibraryNVALA Archive , Albert Sloman Library, University of Essex of the University of Essex.\\"National Viewers' and Listeners' Association\\" , Archive Hub website Whitehouse's early campaign and her disagreements with the BBC under Greene were the basis of a drama first broadcast in 2008 entitled Filth: The Mary Whitehouse Story, written by Amanda Coe.

Its members murdered hundreds of thousands of Serbs, Jews, and Roma as well as political dissidents in Yugoslavia during World War II. They were known for their particularly brutal and sadistic methods of execution, which often included torture and dismemberment. Much of the ideology of the Usta≈°e was based on Nazi racial theory. Like the Nazis, the Usta≈°e deemed Jews, Romani, and Slavs to be sub- humans (Untermenschen). They endorsed the claims from German racial theorists that Croats were not Slavs but a Germanic race. Their genocides against Serbs, against the Jews, and against the Romani were thus expressions of Nazi racial ideology. However, the Usta≈°e viewed the Bosniaks as \\"Muslim Croats,\\" not Slavs, and as a result did not persecute Muslim Bosniaks on the basis of race. In addition to Nazi racial theory, the Usta≈°e ideology incorporated fascism, Roman Catholicism and Croatian nationalism. The Usta≈°e supported the creation of a Greater Croatia that would span the Drina River and extend to the border of Belgrade.Meier, Viktor. Yugoslavia: A History of Its Demise (English), London, UK: Routledge, 1999, p. 125. The movement emphasized the need for a racially \\"pure\\" Croatia and promoted genocide against Serbs, Jews and Romani people, and persecution of anti-fascist or dissident Croats and Bosniaks. They are variously known in English as the Usta≈°e, Ustashe, Ustashi, Ustahis, or Ustashas (OED 2020 adds Ustachi, Ustaci, Ustasha, Usta≈°a, and Ustasi); with the associated adjective sometimes being Ustashe or Ustasha, apart from Usta≈°e. This variance stems from the fact that Usta≈°e is the plural form of Usta≈°a in the Serbo-Croatian language. Fiercely Roman Catholic, the Usta≈°e espoused Roman Catholicism and Islam as the religions of the Croats and Bosniaks and condemned Orthodox Christianity, which was the main religion of the Serbs. Roman Catholicism was identified with Croatian nationalism,Kent, Peter C. The lonely Cold War of Pope Pius XII: The Roman Catholic Church and the Division of Europe, 1943‚Äì1950, McGill-Queen's Press (MQUP), 2002 p. 46; \\"Fiercely nationalistic, the Usta≈°e were also fervently Catholic, identifying, in the Yugoslav political context, Catholicism with Croatian nationalism...\\" while Islam, which had a large following in Bosnia and Herzegovina, was praised by the Usta≈°e as the religion that \\"keeps true the blood of Croats.\\"Butiƒá-Jeliƒá, Fikreta. Usta≈°e i Nezavisna Dr≈æava Hrvatska 1941‚Äì1945. Liber, 1977 When it was founded in 1930, it was a nationalist organization that sought to create an independent Croatian state. When the Usta≈°e came to power in the NDH, a quasi-protectorate established by Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany during World War II, its military wings became the Army of the Independent State of Croatia and the Usta≈°e militia (). However, the Usta≈°e never received massive support from ordinary Croats. The Usta≈°e regime was backed by parts of the Croatian population that during the interwar period had felt oppressed in the Serbian-led Yugoslavia. Most of the support it had initially gained by creating a Croat national state was lost because of the brutal practices it used. The movement functioned as a terrorist organization before World War II but in April 1941, they were appointed to rule a part of Axis-occupied Yugoslavia as the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), which has been described as both an Italian-German quasi-protectorate, and as a puppet stateYugoslavia, Holocaust Encyclopedia, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum website; accessed 25 April 2014.History of Croatia:World War II of Nazi Germany. Name The word usta≈°a (plural: usta≈°e) is derived from the intransitive verb ustati (Croatian for rise up). \\"\\" () was a military rank in the Imperial Croatian Home Guard (1868‚Äì1918). The same term was the name of Croatian third-class infantry regiments () during World War I (1914‚Äì1918). Another variation of the word ustati is ustanik (plural: ustanici) which means an insurgent, or a rebel. The name usta≈°a did not have fascist connotations during the early years of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia as the term \\"ustat\\" was itself used in Herzegovina to denote the insurgents from the Herzegovinian rebellion of 1875. The full original name of the organization appeared in April 1931 as the or UHRO (Usta≈°a ‚Äì Croatian Revolutionary Organization); in 1933 it was renamed the (Usta≈°a ‚Äì Croatian Revolutionary Movement), a name it kept until World War II. In English, Ustasha, Ustashe, Ustashas and Ustashi are used for the movement or its members. Ideology =Ideological roots= Poglavnik Ante Paveliƒá and Italy's Duce Benito Mussolini on 18 May 1941 in Rome. The Usta≈°e were heavily influenced by Italian Fascism and politically supported by Fascist Italy. Germany's F√ºhrer Adolf Hitler with Paveliƒá at the Berghof outside Berchtesgaden, Germany. The Usta≈°e increasingly came under the influence of Nazism after the founding of the NDH in 1941. One of the major ideological influences on the Croatian nationalism of the Usta≈°e was 19th century Croatian activist Ante Starƒçeviƒá, an advocate of Croatian unity and independence, who was both anti-Habsburg and anti-Serbian in outlook. He envisioned the creation of a Greater Croatia that would include territories inhabited by Bosniaks, Serbs, and Slovenes, considering Bosniaks and Serbs to be Croats who had been converted to Islam and Orthodox Christianity, while considering the Slovenes to be \\"mountain Croats\\". Starƒçeviƒá argued that the large Serb presence in territories claimed by a Greater Croatia was the result of recent settlement, encouraged by Habsburg rulers, and the influx of groups like Vlachs who took up Orthodox Christianity and identified themselves as Serbs. Starƒçeviƒá admired Bosniaks because in his view they were Croats who had adopted Islam in order to preserve the economic and political autonomy of Bosnia and Croatia under the rule of the Ottoman Empire. The Usta≈°e used Starƒçeviƒá's theories to promote the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina to Croatia and recognized Croatia as having two major ethnocultural components: Catholics and Muslims. The Usta≈°e sought to represent Starƒçeviƒá as being connected to their views. Josip Frank seceded his extreme fraction from Starƒçeviƒá's party and formed his own the Pure Party of Rights, which became the main pool of members of the subsequent Usta≈°e movement. Historian John Paul Newman stated that Austro-Hungarian officers' \\"unfaltering opposition to Yugoslavia provided a blueprint for the Croatian radical right, the Usta≈°e\\". The Usta≈°e promoted the theories of Dr Milan ≈†ufflay, who is believed to have claimed that Croatia had been \\"one of the strongest ramparts of Western civilization for many centuries\\", which he claimed had been lost through its union with Serbia when the nation of Yugoslavia was formed in 1918. ≈†ufflay was killed in Zagreb in 1931 by government supporters.\\"Einstein accuses Yugoslavian rulers in savant's murder\\", The New York Times, 6 May 1931. mirrormirrorCohen, Philip J. and David Riesman. Serbia's Secret War: Propaganda and the Deceit of History. Texas A&M; University Press, 1996, pp. 10‚Äì11. The Usta≈°e accepted the 1935 thesis by a Franciscan friar, Father Krunoslav Draganoviƒá, who claimed that many Catholics in southern Herzegovina had been converted to Orthodox Christianity in the 16th and 17th centuries, in order to justify a policy of forcible conversion of Orthodox Christians in the area to Catholicism. The Usta≈°e were heavily influenced by Nazism and fascism. Paveliƒá's position of Poglavnik was based on the similar positions of Duce held by Benito Mussolini and F√ºhrer held by Adolf Hitler. The Usta≈°e, like fascists, promoted a corporatist economy. Paveliƒá and the Usta≈°e were allowed sanctuary in Italy by Mussolini after being exiled from Yugoslavia. Paveliƒá had been in negotiations with Fascist Italy since 1927 that included advocating a territory-for-sovereignty swap in which he would tolerate Italy annexing its claimed territory in Dalmatia in exchange for Italy supporting the sovereignty of an independent Croatia. Mussolini's support of the Usta≈°e was based on pragmatic considerations, such as maximizing Italian influence in the Balkans and the Adriatic. After 1937, with the weakening of French influence in Europe following Germany's remilitarization of the Rhineland and with the rise of a quasi-fascist government in Yugoslavia under Milan Stojadinoviƒá, Mussolini abandoned support for the Usta≈°e from 1937 to 1939 and sought to improve relations with Yugoslavia, fearing that continued hostility towards Yugoslavia would result in Yugoslavia entering Germany's sphere of influence.Van Creveld, Martin L. Hitler's Strategy 1940‚Äì1941: The Balkan Clue. 2nd edition. London/New York: Cambridge University Press, 1974. pp. 6‚Äì8 Anti- Serbian and anti-communist Usta≈°e poster The collapse of the quasi-fascist Stojadinoviƒá regime resulted in Italy restoring its support for the Usta≈°e, whose aim was to create an independent Croatia in personal union with Italy. However, distrust of the Usta≈°e grew. Mussolini's son-in-law and Italian foreign minister Count Galeazzo Ciano noted in his diary that \\"The Duce is indignant with Paveliƒá, because he claims that the Croats are descendants of the Goths. This will have the effect of bringing them into the German orbit\\".Galeazzo Ciano, Count; Malcolm Muggeridge (translator). Ciano's diary, 1939‚Äì1943. W. Heinemann, 1950, p. 392. Hungary strongly supported the Usta≈°e for two aims. One, in order to weaken Yugoslavia, Little Entente, in order to ultimately regain some of its lost territories. The other, Hungary also wished to establish later in the future a strong alliance with the Independent State of Croatia and possibly enter a personal union. Nazi Germany initially didn't support an independent Croatia, nor did it support the Usta≈°e, with Hitler stressing the importance of a \\"strong and united Yugoslavia\\". Nazi officials, including Hermann G√∂ring, wanted Yugoslavia stable and officially neutral during the war so Germany could continue to securely gain Yugoslavia's raw material exports. The Nazis grew irritated with the Usta≈°e, among them Reichsfuhrer SS Heinrich Himmler, who was dissatisfied with the lack of full compliance by the NDH to the Nazis' agenda of extermination of the Jews, as the Usta≈°e permitted Jews who converted to Catholicism to be recognized as \\"honorary Croats\\", thus putatively exempt from persecution. =Political programme and main agendas= In 1932, an editorial in the first issue of the Usta≈°e newspaper, signed by the Usta≈°e leader Ante Paveliƒá, proclaimed that violence and terror would be the main means for the Usta≈°e to attain their goals: > The KNIFE, REVOLVER, MACHINE GUN and TIME BOMB; these are the idols, these > are bells that will announce the dawning and THE RESURRECTION OF THE > INDEPENDENT STATE OF CROATIA. In 1933, the Usta≈°e presented \\"The Seventeen Principles\\" that formed the official ideology of the movement. The Principles stated the uniqueness of the Croatian nation, promoted collective rights over individual rights and declared that people who were not Croat by \\"blood\\" would be excluded from political life. Those considered \\"undesirables\\" were subjected to mass murder. These principles called for the creation of a new economic system that would be neither capitalist nor communist and which emphasized the importance of the Roman Catholic Church and the patriarchial family as means to maintain social order and morality. (The name given by modern historian to this particular aspect of Usta≈°e ideology varies; \\"national Catholicism\\", \\"political Catholicism\\" and \\"Catholic Croatism\\"Lampe, John R. have been proposed among others.) In power, the Usta≈°e banned contraception and tightened laws against blasphemy.Atkin, Nicholas and Frank Tallet. Priests, Prelates and People: A History of European Catholicism since 1750. New York, New York: I.B. Tauris & Co. Ltd., 2003. p. 248. Usta≈°e gathering in Zagreb The Usta≈°e accepted that Croats are part of the Dinaric race,Caccamo, Francesco and Trinchese, Stefano. Rotte adriatiche. Tra Italia, Balcani e Mediterraneo. FrancoAngeli, 2011. p. 158. but rejected the idea that Croats are primarily Slavic, claiming they are primarily descended from Germanic roots with the Goths.Rich, Norman. Hitler's War Aims: the Establishment of the New Order (1974), pp. 276‚Äì77. W.W. Norton & Co: New York. The Usta≈°e believed that a government must naturally be strong and authoritarian. The movement opposed parliamentary democracy for being \\"corrupt\\" and Marxism and Bolshevism for interfering in family life and the economy and for their materialism. The Usta≈°e considered competing political parties and elected parliaments to be harmful to its own interests. The Usta≈°e recognized both Roman Catholicism and Islam as national religions of the Croatian people but initially rejected Orthodox Christianity as being incompatible with their objectives. Although the Usta≈°e emphasized religious themes, it stressed that duty to the nation took precedence over religious custom.Greble, Emily. Sarajevo, 1941‚Äì1945: Muslims, Christians, and Jews in Hitler's Europe. Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 2011. p. 125. In power, the Usta≈°e banned the use of the term \\"Serbian Orthodox faith\\", requiring \\"Greek-Eastern faith\\" in its place. The Usta≈°e forcefully converted many Orthodox to Catholicism, murdered and expelled 85% of Orthodox priests, and plundered and burnt many Orthodox Christian churches. The Usta≈°e also persecuted Old Catholics who did not recognize papal infallibility. On 2 July 1942 the Croatian Orthodox Church was founded, as a further means to destroy the Serbian Orthodox Church, but this new Church gained very few followers. The Usta≈°e attached conditions to the Croatian citizenship of Muslims, such as asserting that a Muslim who supported Yugoslavia would not be considered a Croat nor a citizen but would instead be considered a \\"Muslim Serb\\" who could be denied property and imprisoned. The Usta≈°e claimed that such \\"Muslim Serbs\\" had to earn Croat status. = Antisemitism = See also: The Holocaust in the Independent State of Croatia While initial focus was against Serbs, as the Usta≈°e grew closer to the Nazis they adopted antisemitism. In 1936, in \\"The Croat Question\\", Ante Paveliƒá placed Jews third among \\"the Enemies of the Croats\\" (after Serbs and Freemasons, but before Communists): writing: > ‚Ä≥Today, practically all finance and nearly all commerce in Croatia is in > Jewish hands. This became possible only through the support of the state, > which thereby seeks, on one hand, to strengthen the pro-Serbian Jews, and on > the other, to weaken Croat national strength. The Jews celebrated the > establishment of the so-called Yugoslav state with great joy, because a > national Croatia could never be as useful to them as a multi-national > Yugoslavia; for in national chaos lies the power of the Jews... In fact, as > the Jews had foreseen, Yugoslavia became, in consequence of the corruption > of official life in Serbia, a true Eldorado of Jewry.\\"Ante Pavelic: The > Croat Question http://chnm.gmu.edu/history/faculty/kelly/blogs/h312/wp- > content/sources/pavelic.pdf Once in power, the Usta≈°e immediately introduced a series of Nazi-style Racial Laws. On 30 April 1941, the Usta≈°e proclaimed the \\"Legal Decree on Racial Origins\\" the \\"Legal Decree on the Protection of Aryan Blood and the Honor of the Croatian People\\", and the \\"Legal Provision on Citizenship\\". These decrees defined who was a Jew, and took away the citizenship rights of all non-Aryans, i.e. Jews and Roma. By the end of April 1941, months before the Nazis implemented similar measures in Germany and over a year after being implemented in occupied Poland, the Usta≈°e required all Jews to wear insignia, typically a yellow Star of David. The Usta≈°e declared the \\"Legal Provision on the Nationalization of the Property of Jews and Jewish Companies\\", on 10 October 1941, and with it they confiscated all Jewish property. Already on their first day, 10‚Äì11 April 1941, Usta≈°e arrested a group of prominent Zagreb Jews and held them for ransom. On 13 April the same was done in Osijek, where Usta≈°e and Volksdeutscher mobs also destroyed the synagogue and Jewish graveyard. This process was repeated multiple times in 1941 with groups of Jews. Simultaneously, the Usta≈°e initiated extensive antisemitic propaganda, with Usta≈°e papers writing that Croatians must \\"be more alert than any other ethnic group to protect their racial purity, ... We need to keep our blood clean of the Jews\\". They also wrote that Jews are synonymous with \\"treachery, cheating, greed, immorality and foreigness\\", and therefore \\"wide swaths of the Croatian people always despised the Jews and felt towards them natural revulsion\\". In May 1941, the Usta≈°e rounded up 165 Jewish youth in Zagreb, members of the Jewish sports club Makabi, and sent them to the Danica concentration camp (all but 3 were later killed by the Usta≈°e). The Usta≈°e sent most Jews to Usta≈°e and Nazi concentration camps‚Äîincluding the notorious, Usta≈°e-run, Jasenovac‚Äîwhere all told nearly, 32,000, or 80% of the Jews in the Independent State of Croatia, were exterminated.\\"Holocaust Era in Croatia 1941-1945: Jasenovac\\" United States Holocaust Memorial Museum In October 1941, the Usta≈°e mayor of Zagreb ordered the demolition of the Zagreb Synagogue, which was completely demolished by April 1942. The Usta≈°e persecuted Jews who practiced Judaism but authorized Jewish converts to Catholicism to be recognized as Croatian citizens and be given honorary Aryan citizenship that allowed them to be reinstated at the jobs from which they had previously been separated. After they stripped Jews of their citizenship rights, the Usta≈°e allowed some to apply for Aryan rights via bribes and/or through connections to prominent Usta≈°e. The whole process was highly arbitrary. Only 2% of Zagreb's Jews were granted Aryan rights, for example. Also, Aryan rights did not guarantee permanent protection from being sent to concentration camps or other persecution. = Other measures = Economically, the Usta≈°e supported the creation of a corporatist economy.Griffin, Roger. The Nature of Fascism. Digital Printing edition. New York, New York: Routledge, 2003, p. 120. The movement believed that natural rights existed to private property and ownership over small-scale means of production free from state control. Armed struggle, revenge and terrorism were glorified by the Usta≈°e. The Usta≈°e introduced widespread measures, to which many Croats themselves fell victim. Jozo Tomasevich in his book War and Revolution in Yugoslavia: 1941-1945, states that \\"never before in history had Croats been exposed to such legalized administrative, police and judicial brutality and abuse as during the Usta≈°a regime.\\" Decrees enacted by the regime formed the basis that allowed it to get rid of all unwanted employees in state and local government and in state enterprises, the \\"unwanted\\" being all Jews, Serbs and Yugoslav-oriented Croats who were all thrown out except for some deemed specifically needed by the government. This would leave a multitude of jobs to be filled by Usta≈°es and pro-Usta≈°e adherents, and would lead to government jobs being filled by people with no professional qualifications. History =Before World War II= During the 1920s, Ante Paveliƒá, lawyer, politician and one of the followers Frank's party, became the leading advocate of Croatian independence. In 1927, he secretly contacted Benito Mussolini, dictator of Italy and founder of fascism, and presented his separatist ideas to him. Paveliƒá proposed an independent Greater Croatia that should cover the entire historical and ethnic area of the Croats. Historian Rory Yeomans claimed that there are indication that Paveliƒá had been considering the formation of some kind of nationalist insurgency group as early as 1928. In October 1928, after the assassination of leading Croatian politician Stjepan Radiƒá, Croatian Peasant Party President in the Yugoslav Assembly by radical Montenegrin politician Puni≈°a Raƒçiƒá, a youth group named the Croat Youth Movement was founded by Branimir Jeliƒá at the University of Zagreb. A year later Ante Paveliƒá was invited by the 21-year-old Jeliƒá into the organization as a junior member. A related movement, the Domobranski Pokret‚Äîwhich had been the name of the legal Croatian army in Austria-Hungary‚Äîbegan publication of Hrvatski Domobran, a newspaper dedicated to Croatian national matters. The Usta≈°e sent Hrvatski Domobran to the United States to garner support for them from Croatian-Americans.Kivisto, Peter. The Ethnic enigma: the salience of ethnicity for European-origin groups. Cranbury, NJ/London, UK/Mississauga, Canada: Associated University Press, 1989. p. 107 The organization around the Domobran tried to engage with and radicalize moderate Croats, using Radiƒá's assassination to stir up emotions within the divided country. By 1929 two divergent Croatian political streams had formed: those who supported Paveliƒá's view that only violence could secure Croatia's national interests, and the Croatian Peasant Party, led then by Vladko Maƒçek, successor to Stjepan Radiƒá, which had much greater support among Croats.ƒêilas, Aleksa. The Contested Country: Yugoslav Unity and Communist Revolution, 1919‚Äì1953, Harvard University Press, 1991, pp. 114‚Äì115, 129. Various members of the Croatian Party of Rights contributed to the writing of the Domobran, until around Christmas 1928 when the newspaper was banned by authorities of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. In January 1929 the king banned all national parties,Joviƒá, Dejan. Yugoslavia: a state that withered away, p. 51 and the radical wing of the Party of Rights was exiled, including Paveliƒá, Jeliƒá and Gustav Perƒçec. This group was later joined by several other Croatian exiles. On 22 March 1941 Zvonimir Pospi≈°il and Mijo Babiƒá murdered Toni ≈†legel, the chief editor of newspaper Novosti from Zagreb and president of Jugo≈°tampa, which was the beginning of the terrorist actions of Usta≈°e.:\\"Usta≈°ke teroristiƒçke akcije poƒçele su 22. marta 1929. godine u Zagrebu, gdje su Mijo Babiƒá i Zvonko Pospi≈°il revolverskim hicima ubili glavnog urednika zagrebaƒçkih ¬ªNovosti¬´ i predsjednika ¬ªJugo≈°tampe¬´ Toni ≈†legela.\\" On 20 April 1929 Paveliƒá and others co-signed a declaration in Sofia, Bulgaria, with members of the Macedonian National Committee, asserting that they would pursue \\"their legal activities for the establishment of human and national rights, political freedom and complete independence for both Croatia and Macedonia\\". The Court for the Preservation of the State in Belgrade sentenced Paveliƒá and Perƒçec to death on 17 July 1929. The exiles started organizing support for their cause among the Croatian diaspora in Europe, as well as North and South America. In January 1932 they named their revolutionary organization \\"Usta≈°a\\". The Usta≈°e carried out terrorist acts, to cause as much damage as possible to Yugoslavia. From their training camps in fascist Italy and Hungary, they planted time bombs on international trains bound for Yugoslavia, causing deaths and material damage. In November 1932 ten Usta≈°e, led by Andrija Artukoviƒá and supported by four local sympathizers, attacked a gendarme outpost at Bru≈°ani in the Lika/Velebit area, in an apparent attempt to intimidate the Yugoslav authorities. The incident has sometimes been termed the \\"Velebit uprising\\". Assassination of King Alexander I Universal Newsreel's film about the assassination of Alexander I The Usta≈°e's most famous terrorist act was carried out on 9 October 1934, when working with the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO), they assassinated King Alexander I of Yugoslavia. The perpetrator, a Bulgarian revolutionary, Vlado Chernozemski, was killed by French police. Three Usta≈°e members who had been waiting at different locations for the king‚ÄîMijo Kralj, Zvonimir Pospi≈°il and Milan Rajiƒá‚Äîwere captured and sentenced to life imprisonment by a French court. Ante Paveliƒá, along with Eugen Kvaternik and Ivan Perƒçeviƒá, were subsequently sentenced to death in absentia by a French court, as the real organizers of the deed. The Usta≈°e believed that the assassination of King Alexander had effectively \\"broken the backbone of Yugoslavia\\" and that it was their \\"most important achievement.\\" Soon after the assassination, all organizations related to the Usta≈°e as well as the Hrvatski Domobran, which continued as a civil organization, were banned throughout Europe. Under pressure from France, the Italian police arrested Paveliƒá and several Usta≈°e emigrants in October 1934. Paveliƒá was imprisoned in Turin and released in March 1936. After he met with Eugen Dido Kvaternik, he stated that assassination was \\"the only language Serbs understand\\". While in prison, Paveliƒá was informed of the 1935 election in Yugoslavia, when the coalition led by Croat Vladko Maƒçek won. He stated that his victory was aided by the activity of Usta≈°e. By the mid-1930s, graffiti with the initials ≈ΩAP meaning \\"Long live Ante Paveliƒá\\" () had begun to appear on the streets of Zagreb. During the 1930s, a split developed between the \\"home\\" Usta≈°e members who stayed behind in Croatia and Bosnia to struggle against Yugoslavia and the \\"emigre\\" Usta≈°e who went abroad. The \\"emigre\\" Usta≈°e who had a much lower educational level were viewed as violent, ignorant and fanatical by the \\"home\\" Usta≈°e while the \\"home\\" Usta≈°e were dismissed as \\"soft\\" by the \\"emigres\\" who saw themselves as a \\"warrior-elite\\". After March 1937, when Italy and Yugoslavia signed a pact of friendship, Usta≈°e and their activities were banned, which attracted the attention of young Croats, especially university students, who would become sympathizers or members. In 1936, the Yugoslav government offered amnesty to those Usta≈°e abroad provided they promised to renounce violence; many of the \\"emigres\\" accepted the amnesty and returned home to continue the struggle. In the late 1930s, the Usta≈°e started to infiltrate the para-military organizations of the Croat Peasant Party, the Croatian Defense Force and the Peasant Civil Party. At the University of Zagreb, an Usta≈°e-linked student group become the largest single student group by 1939. In February 1939 two returnees from detention, Mile Budak and Ivan Or≈°aniƒá, became editors of Hrvatski narod, known in English as The Croatian Nation, a pro-Usta≈°e journal. =World War II= The Axis powers invaded Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941. Vladko Maƒçek, the leader of the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS), which was the most influential party in Croatia at the time, rejected German offers to lead the new government. On 10 April the most senior home-based Usta≈°e, Slavko Kvaternik, took control of the police in Zagreb and in a radio broadcast that day proclaimed the formation of the Independent State of Croatia (Nezavisna Dr≈æava Hrvatska, NDH). The name of the state was an attempt to capitalise on the Croat struggle for independence. Maƒçek issued a statement that day, calling on all Croatians to cooperate with the new authorities.Maƒçek, Vladko. In the Struggle for Freedom (New York: Robert Speller & Sons, 1957), p. 230. A unit of Usta≈°e in Sarajevo Meanwhile, Paveliƒá and several hundred Usta≈°e left their camps in Italy for Zagreb, where he declared a new government on 16 April 1941. He accorded himself the title of \\"Poglavnik\\"‚Äîa Croatian approximation to \\"F√ºhrer\\". The Independent State of Croatia was declared on Croatian \\"ethnic and historical territory\\", \\"‚Ä¶ ethnic and historical territory\\". what is today Republic of Croatia (without Istria), Bosnia and Herzegovina, Syrmia and the Bay of Kotor. However, a few days after the declaration of independence, the Usta≈°e were forced to sign the Treaty of Rome where they surrendered part of Dalmatia and Krk, Rab, Korƒçula, Biograd, ≈†ibenik, Split, ƒåiovo, ≈†olta, Mljet and part of Konavle and the Bay of Kotor to Italy. De facto control over this territory varied for the majority of the war, as the Partisans grew more successful, while the Germans and Italians increasingly exercised direct control over areas of interest. The Germans and Italians split the NDH into two zones of influence, one in the southwest controlled by the Italians and the other in the northeast controlled by the Germans. As a result, the NDH has been described as \\"an Italian-German quasi- protectorate\\". In September 1943, after Italian capitulation, the NDH annexed the whole territory which was annexed by Italy according to Treaty of Rome. =Usta≈°e Militia= Meeting in Bosnia between representatives of the Chetniks and Independent State of Croatia officers (including the Usta≈°e militia and the Croatian Home Guard) The Army of the Independent State of Croatia was composed of enlistees who did not participate in Usta≈°e activities. The Usta≈°e Militia was organised in 1941 into five (later 15) 700-man battalions, two railway security battalions and the elite Black Legion and Poglavnik Bodyguard Battalion (later Brigade).Thomas, N./Mikulan, K. Axis Forces in Yugoslavia 1941‚Äì45. London: Osprey, 1995; . They were predominantly recruited among uneducated population and working class.:\\"The social background of rankand- file Ustasha recruits was overwhelmingly working class and uneducated;\\" On 27 April 1941 a newly formed unit of the Usta≈°e army killed members of the largely Serbian community of Gudovac, near Bjelovar. Eventually all who opposed and/or threatened the Usta≈°e were outlawed. The HSS was banned on 11 June 1941, in an attempt by the Usta≈°e to take their place as the primary representative of the Croatian peasantry. Vladko Maƒçek was sent to the Jasenovac concentration camp, but later released to serve a house arrest sentence due to his popularity among the people. Maƒçek was later again called upon by foreigners to take a stand and oppose the Paveliƒá government, but refused. In early 1941 Jews and Serbs were ordered to leave certain areas of Zagreb.Some were sent to concentration camps and subsequently killed. For a description of these deportations and the treatment in the camps C.f. Djuro Schwartz, \\"In the Jasenovac camps of death\\" (◊í'◊ï◊®◊ï ◊©◊ï◊ï◊ê◊®◊•, ◊ë◊û◊ó◊†◊ï◊™ ◊î◊û◊ï◊ï◊™ ◊©◊ú ◊ô◊ê◊°◊†◊ï◊ë◊ê◊•\\", ◊ß◊ï◊ë◊• ◊û◊ó◊ß◊®◊ô◊ù ◊õ\\"◊î, ◊ô◊ì-◊ï◊©◊ù) In the months after Independent State of Croatia has been established, most of Usta≈°e groups were not under centralized control: besides 4,500 regular Usta≈°e Corps troops, there was some 25,000‚Äì30,0000 \\"Wild Usta≈°e\\" (hrv. \\"divlje usta≈°e\\"), boosted by government- controlled press as \\"peasant Usta≈°e\\" \\"begging\\" to be sent to fight enemies of the regime. After mass crimes against Serb populace committed during the Summer months of 1941, the regime decided to blame all the atrocities to the irregular Usta≈°e‚Äîthoroughly undisciplined and paid for the service only with the booty; authorities even sentenced to death and executed publicly in August and September 1941 many of them for unauthorized use of extreme violence against Serbs and Gypsies. To put an end to Wild Usta≈°e uncontrolled looting and killing, the central government used some 6,000 gendarmes and some 45,000 newly recruited members of regular \\"Domobranstvo\\" forces. Paveliƒá first met with Adolf Hitler on 6 June 1941. Mile Budak, then a minister in Paveliƒá's government, publicly proclaimed the violent racial policy of the state on 22 July 1941. Vjekoslav \\"Maks\\" Luburiƒá, a chief of the secret police, started building concentration camps in the summer of the same year. Usta≈°e activities in villages across the Dinaric Alps led the Italians and the Germans to express their disquiet. According to writer/historian Srƒëa Trifkoviƒá, as early as 10 July 1941 Wehrmacht Gen. Edmund Glaise von Horstenau reported the following to the German High Command, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW): > Our troops have to be mute witnesses of such events; it does not reflect > well on their otherwise high reputation . . . I am frequently told that > German occupation troops would finally have to intervene against Usta≈°e > crimes. This may happen eventually. Right now, with the available forces, I > could not ask for such action. Ad hoc intervention in individual cases could > make the German Army look responsible for countless crimes which it could > not prevent in the past. Historian Jonathan Steinberg describes Usta≈°e crimes against Serbian and Jewish civilians: \\"Serbian and Jewish men, women and children were literally hacked to death\\". Reflecting on the photos of Usta≈°e crimes taken by Italians, Steinberg writes: \\"There are photographs of Serbian women with breasts hacked off by pocket knives, men with eyes gouged out, emasculated and mutilated\\". A Gestapo report to Reichsf√ºhrer SS Heinrich Himmler, dated 17 February 1942, stated: In September 1942 an Usta≈°e Defensive Brigade was formed, and during 1943 the Usta≈°e battalions were re-organised into eight four-battalion brigades (1st to 8th). In 1943 the Germans suffered major losses on the Eastern Front and the Italians signed an armistice with the Allies, leaving behind significant caches of arms which the Partisans would use. Partisans of the 6th Krajina Brigade By 1944 Paveliƒá was almost totally reliant on Usta≈°e units, now 100,000 strong, formed in Brigades 1 to 20, Recruit Training Brigades 21 to 24, three divisions, two railway brigades, one defensive brigade and the new Mobile Brigade. In November 1944 the army was effectively put under Usta≈°e control when the Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia were combined with the units of the Usta≈°e to form 18 divisions, comprising 13 infantry, two mountain and two assault divisions and one replacement division, each with its own organic artillery and other support units. There were several armored units. Fighting continued for a short while after the formal surrender of German Army Group E on 9 May 1945, as Paveliƒá ordered the NDH forces to attempt to escape to Austria, together with a large number of civilians. The Battle of Poljana, between a mixed German and Usta≈°e column and a Partisan force, was the last battle of World War II on European soil. Most of those fleeing, including both Usta≈°e and civilians, were handed over to the Partisans at Bleiburg and elsewhere on the Austrian border. Paveliƒá hid in Austria and Rome, with the help of Catholic clergy, later fleeing to Argentina. =After the war= After World War II, many of the Usta≈°e went underground or fled to countries such as Canada, Australia, Germany and some countries in South America, notably Argentina, with the assistance of Roman Catholic churches and their own grassroots supporters. For several years some Usta≈°e tried to organize a resistance group called the Crusaders, but their efforts were largely foiled by the Yugoslav authorities.Ladislaus Hory und Martin Broszat. Der kroatische Ustascha-Staat, Deutsche Verlag-Anstalt, Stuttgart, 2. Auflage 1965, pp. 13‚Äì38, 75‚Äì80. With the defeat of the Independent State of Croatia, the active movement went dormant. Infighting fragmented the surviving Usta≈°e. Paveliƒá formed the Croatian Liberation Movement, which drew in several of the former state's leaders. Vjekoslav Vranƒçiƒá founded a reformed Croatian Liberation Movement and was its leader. Maks Luburiƒá formed the Croatian National Resistance. Branimir Jeliƒá founded the Croatian National Committee. Blagoje Jovoviƒá, a Montenegrin, shot Paveliƒá near Buenos Aires on 9 April 1957; Paveliƒá later died of his injuries. An entire Serb family lies slaughtered in their home following a raid by the Usta≈°e militia, 1941 Ethnic and religious persecution The Usta≈°e intended to create an ethnically \\"pure\\" Croatia, and they viewed the Serbs living in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina as the biggest obstacle to this goal. Usta≈°e ministers Mile Budak, Mirko Puk and Milovan ≈Ωaniƒá declared in May 1941 that the goal of the new Usta≈°e policy was an ethnically pure Croatia. The strategy to achieve their goal was:Jones, Adam & Nicholas A. Robins. (2009), Genocides by The Oppressed: Subaltern Genocide in Theory and Practice, p. 106, Indiana University Press; Jacobs, Steven L. Confronting Genocide: Judaism, Christianity, Islam, pp. 158‚Äì59, Lexington Books, 2009 # One third of the Serbs were to be killed # One third of the Serbs were to be expelled # One third of the Serbs were to be forcibly converted to Catholicism The NDH government cooperated with Nazi Germany in the Holocaust and exercised their own version of the genocide against Serbs, Jews and Roma (aka \\"gypsies\\") inside its borders. State policy towards Serbs had first been declared in the words of Milovan ≈Ωaniƒá, a minister of the NDH Legislative council, on 2 May 1941: Bosanska Gradi≈°ka > This country can only be a Croatian country, and there is no method we would > hesitate to use in order to make it truly Croatian and cleanse it of Serbs, > who have for centuries endangered us and who will endanger us again if they > are given the opportunity. The Usta≈°e enacted race laws patterned after those of the Third Reich, which persecuted Jews, Romani and Serbs, who were collectively declared to be enemies of the Croatian people. Serbs, Jews, Roma and Croatian and Bosniak dissidents, including Communists, were interned in concentration camps, the largest of which was Jasenovac. By the end of the war the Usta≈°e, under Paveliƒá's leadership, had exterminated an estimated 30,000 Jews and 26‚Äì29,000 Roma, while the number of Serb victims ranges as low as 200,000 to as high as 500,000 with historians generally listing between 300,000‚Äì350,000 deaths. The history textbooks in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia cited 700,000 as the total number of victims at Jasenovac. This was promulgated from a 1946 calculation of the demographic loss of population (the difference between the actual number of people after the war and the number that would have been, had the pre-war growth trend continued). After that, it was used by Edvard Kardelj and Mo≈°a Pijade in the Yugoslav war reparations claim sent to Germany. In its entry on Jasenovac, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum says: > Determining the number of victims is highly problematic, due to the > destruction of many relevant documents, the long-term inaccessibility to > independent scholars of those documents that survived, and the ideological > agendas of postwar partisan scholarship and journalism, which has been and > remains influenced by ethnic tension, religious prejudice, and ideological > conflict.The Usta≈°e murdered between 320,000 and 340,000 ethnic Serb > residents of Croatia and Bosnia during the period of Usta≈°a rule; more than > 30,000 Croatian Jews were killed either in Croatia or at Auschwitz-Birkenau. The USHMM notes that estimates on the number of Serb victims, the Usta≈°e's primary victims, vary tremendously and that \\"the most reliable figures place the number between 330,000 and 390,000, with 45,000 to 52,000 Serbs murdered in Jasenovac.\\" Glina The Jasenovac Memorial Area maintains a list of 83,145 names of Jasenovac victims that was gathered by government officials in Belgrade in 1964, as well as names and biographical data for the victims identified in recent inquiries.Jasenovac Memorial Site official web site; accessed 25 August 2016. As the gathering process was imperfect, they estimated that the list represented between 60%‚Äì75% of the total victims, putting the number of killed in that complex at between roughly 80,000‚Äì100,000. The previous head of the Memorial Area Simo Brdar estimated at least 365,000 dead at Jasenovac. The analyses of statisticians Vladimir ≈Ωerjaviƒá and Bogoljub Koƒçoviƒá were similar to those of the Memorial Area. In all of Yugoslavia, the estimated number of Serb deaths was 487,000 according to Koƒçoviƒá, and 530,000 according to ≈Ωerjaviƒá, out of a total of 1.014 million or 1.027 million deaths (respectively). ≈Ωerjaviƒá further stated there were 197,000 Serb civilians killed in NDH (78,000 as prisoners in Jasenovac and elsewhere) as well as 125,000 Serb combatants. The Belgrade Museum of Holocaust compiled a list of over 77,000 names of Jasenovac victims. It was previously headed by Milan Bulajiƒá, who supported the claim of a total of 700,000 victims. The current administration of the Museum has further expanded the list to include a bit over 80,000 names. During World War II various German military commanders and civilian authorities gave different figures for the number of Serbs, Jews and others killed inside the territory of the Independent State of Croatia. Historian Prof. Jozo Tomasevich has posited that some of these figures may have been a \\"deliberate exaggeration\\" fostered to create further hostility between Serbs and Croats so that they would not unite in resisting the Axis. These figures included 400,000 Serbs (Alexander L√∂hr);Summers, Craig & Eric Markusen. Collective violence: harmful behavior in groups and governments; Rowman & Littlefield, 1999, p. 55 500,000 Serbs (Lothar Rendulic);Rummel, Rudolph J. Democide: Nazi Genocide and Mass Murder; Transaction Publishers, 1992, p. 75. ; \\"While German troops were still in several places in Croatia, the Croatians began a beastly persecution of the Orthodox [Serbs]. At this time at least a half-million people were killed. An unbelievable governing mentality was responsible, as I learned in August 1943 when I received the answer to a question of mine from a government functionary in the circle of the chief of state.\\" 250,000 to March 1943 (Edmund Glaise von Horstenau); more than \\"3/4 of a million Serbs\\" (Hermann Neubacher) in 1943;Neubacher, page 31 600,000‚Äì700,000 in concentration camps until March 1944 (Ernst Fick); 700,000 (Massenbach). =Concentration camps= Usta≈°e militia execute prisoners near the Jasenovac concentration camp A knife, nicknamed \\"Srbosjek\\" or \\"Serbcutter\\", strapped to the hand, which was used by the Usta≈°e militia for the speedy killing of inmates in Jasenovac The first group of camps was formed in the spring of 1941. These included: * Danica near Koprivnica *Slana and Metajna on the Island of Pag * Jadovno near Gospiƒá * Kru≈°ƒçica near Vitez and Travnik in Bosnia *ƒêakovo * Loborgrad in Zagorje * Tenja near Osijek These camps were closed by October 1942. The Jasenovac complex was built between August 1941 and February 1942. The first two camps, Krapje and Broƒçica, were closed in November 1941. The three newer camps continued to function until the end of the war: * Ciglana (Jasenovac III) * Kozara (Jasenovac IV) * Stara Gradi≈°ka (Jasenovac V) ‚Äì concentration camp for women and children There were also other camps in: *Sisak Children's Concentration Camp *Jastrebarsko Children's Concentration Camp *Gospiƒá * Kerestinec prison near Zagreb * Lepoglava near Vara≈ædin Numbers of prisoners: * between 300,000‚Äì350,000 up to 700,000 in Jasenovac (disputed) * around 35,000 in Gospiƒá * around 8,500 in Pag * around 3,000 in ƒêakovo * 1,018 in Jastrebarsko * around 1,000 in Lepoglava = Massacres of Serb civilians = Beyond mass killings in concentration camps, the Usta≈°e perpetrated many massacres of civilians in the field. The first mass killing of Serbs was carried out on 30 April 1941, when the Usta≈°e rounded up and killed 196 Serb villagers at Gudovac. Many other massacres soon followed, including at Blagaj, Glina, Korita, Nevesinje, Prebilovci, Metkovic, Otoƒçac, Voƒçin, ≈†argovac, etc. Here is how the Croatian Catholic Bishop of Mostar, Alojzije Mi≈°iƒá, described the mass killings of Serb civilians just in one small area of Herzegovina, just during the first 6 months of the war:Mostarski biskup Alojzije Mi≈°iƒá za vrijeme Drugog svjetskog rata, Tomo Vuku≈°iƒá > People were captured like beasts. Slaughtered, killed, thrown live into the > abyss. Women, mothers with children, young women, girls and boys were thrown > into pits. The vice-mayor of Mostar, Mr. Baljiƒá, a Mohammedan, publicly > states, although as an official he should be silent and not talk, that in > Ljubinje alone 700 schismatics [i.e. Serb Orthodox Christians] were thrown > into one pit. Six full train carriages of women, mothers and girls, children > under age 10, were taken from Mostar and ƒåapljina to the ≈†urmanci station, > where they were unloaded and taken into the hills, with live mothers and > their children tossed down the cliffs. Everyone was tossed and killed. In > the Klepci parish, from the surrounding villages, 3,700 schismatics were > killed. Poor souls, they were calm. I will not enumerate further. I would go > too far. In the city of Mostar, hundreds were tied up, taken outside the > city and killed like animals.  German accounts of Usta≈°e massacres  German officers in Croatia and Bosnia repeatedly expressed abhorrence at Usta≈°e mass killings of Serbs, using words like ‚Äúslaughter‚Äù, ‚Äúatrocities‚Äù, ‚Äúbutchery‚Äù and ‚Äúterror‚Äù, while citing hundreds of thousands of victims. Thus Major Walter Kleinenberger, officer with the 714th division, complained that Usta≈°e brutality ‚Äúwas in defiance of all laws of civilization. The Usta≈°e murder without exception men, women and children‚Äù. German Captain Konopatzki called the Usta≈°e Black Legion slaughter of Serb civilians in Eastern Bosnia ‚Äúa new wave of butchery of innocents‚Äù. Usta≈°e ‚Äúwholesale butchery‚Äù (Abschlachtung) of Serbs in Srem, in ISC-occupied Serbia, triggered German concerns of Serb uprisings. Lieutenant Colonel von Wedel wrote that in western Bosnia Usta≈°e killed women and children ‚Äúlike cattle‚Äù in a series of ‚Äúbestial executions‚Äù. This is how Hitler‚Äôs Plenipotentiary to Croatia, General von Horstanau, described the aftermath of slaughter committed by Jasenovac concentration camp guards in a nearby village: : At Crkveni Bok, an unfortunate place, over which about five hundred 15- to 20-year-old thugs descended under the leadership of an Ustasha lieutenant colonel, people were killed everywhere, women were raped and then tortured to death, children were killed. I saw in the Sava River the corpse of a young woman with her eyes dug out and a stake driven into her sexual parts. This woman was at most twenty years old when she fell into the hands of these monsters. All around, pigs devoured unburied human beings. \\"Fortunate‚Äù residents were shipped in terrifying freight cars; many of these involuntary \\"passengers\\" cut their veins during transport to the camp [Jasenovac]\\" The German military even took the extraordinary step of trying the Usta≈°e chaplain, Miroslav Filipoviƒá, for the massacre of 2,300 civilians in 3 villages around Banja Luka in February 1942, including 52 children at a school.BiH Supreme Court Archive, B.I.I.k171-13/15-1 In March 3, 1943, General von Horstanau, wrote \\"Thus far 250,000 Serbs have been killed\\". General Lothar Renduliƒá wrote how in August 1942 he remarked to an Usta≈°e official that he could not conceive how 500,000 Serbs had been killed, to which the Usta≈°e replied \\"Half-a-million is a slanderous accusation, the number is not higher than 200,000\\". Other German sources put the total Serb victim numbers in the ISC, as high as 600,000 to 700,000. = Religious persecution = As part of their policy to eliminate Serbs entirely, by killing one-third, converting one-third and expelling one-third. the Usta≈°e conducted forcible conversions of Christian Orthodox Serbs to Catholicism, with the participation of Catholic priests. On occasion they used the prospect of conversion as a means to gather Serbs together so they could kill them, which is what occurred at Glina. On 18 May 1943, Archbishop Stepinac wrote a letter to the pope, in which he estimated 240,000 conversions to date. The Usta≈°e killed 157 Orthodox priests, among them 3 Serb Orthodox bishops (cutting the throat of the bishop of Banja Luka and killing the archbishop of Sarajevo), while they jailed and tortured the Orthodox archbishop of Zagreb. The Usta≈°e expelled to Serbia 327 Orthodox priests and one bishop, while 2 other bishops and 12 priests left on their own. Thus 85% of the Orthodox priests in the Independent State of Croatia were either killed or expelled by the Usta≈°e, in order to \\"leave the Orthodox population without spiritual leadership so the Usta≈°as' policy of forced or fear-induced conversions to Catholicism would be easier to carry out\\" The Usta≈°e destroyed and desecrated numerous Orthodox Churches, forbade the Cyrillic script and Julian calendar (both used in the Orthodox Church), even prohibited the term \\"Serbian Orthodox Church\\". Orthodox schools were shut down, and the Church was prohibited from collecting contributions from believers, robbing it of income. Orthodox Church properties were confiscated by the Usta≈°e, some turned over to the Croatian Catholic Church. Finally, to destroy the Serbian Orthodox Church, the Usta≈°e tried to create its own, alternative Croatian Orthodox Church, with an imported Russian priest. but failed to gain adherents. Despite these many actions by the Usta≈°e to destroy the Serbian Orthodox Church, the historian Jozo Tomasevich found no condemnations of these crimes, public or private, by Catholic Archbishop Stepinac or any other members of the Croatian Catholic Church. On the contrary, he states that this massive Usta≈°e attack on the Serbian Orthodox Church \\"was approved and supported by many Croatian Catholic priests\\", and that the Croatian Roman Catholic Church hierarchy and the Vatican \\"regarded Usta≈°e policies against the Serbs and Serbian Orthodox Church as advantageous to Roman Catholicism\\". Connections with the Catholic Church The historian Mark Biondich observes that the Catholic Church had historically been on the fringes of Croatian politics and public life, and that Church influence had further eroded during the interwar period due to the royal dictatorship and the popularity of the anti-clerical Croatian Peasant Party. During the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Catholic Clergy was deeply dissatisfied with the regime: \\"... a massive press campaign was launched to mobilize Croatia's nearly three million Catholics against the central government's measures penalizing Saint Peter's apostolate. First of all its inequality in treatment was denounced: 'the budget for religion totals 141 million dinars, 70 of which go to the Serbian Church, and 34 to the Catholic one.(...) Pa≈°iƒá's government is kind in Serbia, where each citizen pays 55 dinars in yearly taxes, while it is cruel in Croatia and Slovenia, largely Catholic districts, where each citizen pays 165 dinars in taxes.'\\" Croatian Catholic Church antagonism toward the Orthodox Church became an important part of Usta≈°e antagonism toward Serbs, with fateful consequences during the war. The Usta≈°e supported violent aggression or force to convert Serbo-Croatian speaking Orthodox believers to Roman Catholicism. The Usta≈°e held the position that Eastern Orthodoxy, as a symbol of Serbian nationalism, was their greatest foe and never recognized the existence of a Serb people on the territories of Croatia or Bosnia‚Äîthey recognized only \\"Croats of the Eastern faith\\". Under the Usta≈°e policy of entirely eliminating Serbs, the Catholic Church in Croatia participated in the forced conversion of Orthodox Serbs to Catholicism. However, even conversion did not necessarily protect Serbs and Jews from slaughter. Bishop Alojzije Mi≈°iƒá of Mostar described how while Serb converts to Catholicism \\"were at Church attending holy Mass, they (Usta≈°e) seized them, the young and the old, men and women, drove them like cattle...and soon sent them to eternity, en masse\\". The Usta≈°e called Bosniaks \\"Croats of the Islamic faith\\" and in general tolerated Muslims; in turn the Bosniak community did not demonstrate any particular hostility to the Usta≈°e government.Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Second World War, Enver Red≈æiƒá, Enver Redzic, Psychology Press, 2005 68-73, 79-83 An important number of Muslim conscripts served in the armed forces of Independent State of Croatia, or in its police forces; only a very small number of Muslims served in the ranks of the communist Partisans until the closing days of the war.[Ethnic Conflict and International Intervention: Crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 1990-93: Crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina], Steven L. Burg, Paul S. Shoup Routledge, 4. o≈æu 2015. Marko Do≈°en (far left, giving Nazi salute) and Archbishop Alojzije Stepinac (far right) On 28 April 1941, the head of the Catholic Church in Croatia, Archbishop Alojzije Stepinac, issued a public letter in support of the new Independent State of Croatia (under Usta≈°e-led government), and asked the clergy to pray for its leader, Ante Paveliƒá.Tomasevic, pg. 555m This despite the fact that the Usta≈°e had already proclaimed measures prohibiting Serbs, Jews and Gipsies to serve as policemen, judges and soldiers, and making easy for the state officials to fire members of those ethnic/religious groups from the public administration,, pg. 381-384. and he knew they were preparing Nazi-style racial laws, which Paveliƒá signed only 2 days after. While Stepinac later objected to certain Usta≈°e policies and helped some Jews and Serbs, he continued to publicly support the survival of Independent State of Croatia until its very end, served as the state's War Vicar, and in 1944 received a medal from Paveliƒá.≈†to je nama Stepinac?  http://www.autograf.hr/sto-je-nama-stepinac/ During the ongoing war, Stepinac publicly objected Usta≈°e policies‚Äîin fact, as regards for the relations with head of the Usta≈°e regime Ante Paveliƒá, \\"it is generally agreed that they thoroughly hated each other... archbishop also opposed Fascist and Nazi ideologies, especially Nazi racist ideology, and many Ustasha policies\\", unlike some other members of the Croatian Catholic clergy.War and Revolution in Yugoslavia: 1941 - 1945, Jozo Tomasevich, Stanford University Press, 2002, pg 567 The vast majority of the Catholic clergy in Croatia supported the Usta≈°e at the moment they succeeded in forming Independent State of Croatia; but later when it was clear the Allies would win, the Catholic hierarchy tried to distance the Church from the regime which involved itself in various abuses and war crimes.Cardinal Stepinac: a witness to the truth : a collection of papers from the international conference, Zagreb, September 19, 2008, ≈Ωeljko Tanjiƒá, pg. 23, 45, 62, 76, 84, 170 Yet in its pastoral letter of 24 March 1945, the Croatian Catholic Church still proclaimed its support for the puppet state and its rulers, despite the fact that most senior regime figures were preparing to flee the country. The Catholic press also maintained its support of Paveliƒá right to the end, and Stepinac himself performed a final Te Deum to the NDH on the anniversary of its founding, on 10 April 1945, while the NDH was carrying out the final mass killings to liquidate the Jasenovac concentration camp. Some priests, mostly Franciscans, particularly in, but not limited to, Herzegovina and Bosnia, took part in the atrocities themselves. Priests like Ivan Guberina served as Paveliƒá's bodyguards, while Dionizije Juriƒçev, responsible for the forced conversion of Serbs in the Usta≈°e government, wrote that it was no longer a crime to kill seven-year-olds if they stood in the way of the Usta≈°e movement.Phayer, 2000. p.34 In his diocesan newspaper, the Archbishop of Sarajevo, Ivan ≈†ariƒá, published that the \\"liberation of the world from the Jews is a movement for the renewal of humanity\\".Phayer, 2000. p.35 In Bosnia the Usta≈°e largely ruled through the Catholic clergy, with the priest Bo≈æidar Bralo serving as a chief Usta≈°e delegate for Bosnia. Miroslav Filipoviƒá was a Franciscan friar (from the Petriƒáevac monastery) who allegedly joined the Usta≈°e as chaplain and, on 7 February 1942, joined in the massacre of roughly 2730 Serbs of the nearby villages, including some 500 children. He was allegedly subsequently dismissed from his order and defrocked, although he wore his clerical garb when he was hanged for war crimes. He became Chief Guard of Jasenovac concentration camp where he was nicknamed \\"Fra Sotona\\" (Father Satan) by fellow Croats. Mladen Lorkoviƒá, the Croat minister of foreign affairs, formulated it like this: \\"In Croatia, we can find few real Serbs. The majority of Pravoslavs are as a matter of fact Croats who were forced by foreign invaders to accept the infidel faith. Now it's our duty to bring them back into the Roman Catholic fold.\\"Berenbaum, Michael (editor), A Mosaic of Victims. Non-Jews Persecuted and Murdered by the Nazis, NYU Press, pp. 74‚Äì79 (1 March 1992); / For the duration of the war, \\"in accordance with Vatican's long-term diplomatic practice of not recognizing new states in wartime before they were legitimazed by peace treaties, the pope did not send a nuncio or diplomat to Croatia as requested, but an apostolic visitor, the abbot Giuseppe Marcone, who was to represent the Vatican to Croatian Catholic Church, not to the government. The government ignored this nuance, bestowing a prominent place for Marcone at all official functions\\".The Pope's Dilemma: Pius XII Faces Atrocities and Genocide in the Second World War, Jacques Kornberg, University of Toronto Press, 2015, pg. 87 After World War II ended, the Usta≈°e who had managed to escape from Yugoslav territory (including Paveliƒá) were smuggled to South America.\\"Tied up in the Rat Lines\\", Haaretz, 17 January 2006. This was largely done through ratlines operated by Catholic priests who had previously secured positions at the Vatican. Some of the more infamous members of the Illyrian College of San Girolamo in Rome involved in this were Franciscan friars Krunoslav Draganoviƒá and Dominik Mandiƒá, and a third friar surnamed Petranoviƒá (first name unknown). The Usta≈°e regime had deposited large amounts of gold‚Äîincluding the gold plundered from Serbs and Jews during World War II into‚ÄîSwiss bank accounts. It seems a substantial quantity of gold was additionally transported by Usta≈°e to Austria at the end of the WWII. Out of a total, by some estimates, of 350 million Swiss francs, an intelligence report estimated 200 million (ca. $47 million) reached the Vatican.U.S. and Allied Wartime and Postwar Relations and Negotiations with Argentina, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and Turkey on Looted Gold and German External Assets and U.S. Concerns about the Fate of the Wartime Ustasha Treasury: Supplement to Preliminary Study on U.S. and Allied Efforts to Recover and Restore Gold and Other Assets Stolen Or Hidden by Germany During World War II, William Z.

Pollard, Pollard John F. Cambridge University Press, 6. sij 2005, Pg 200-201 Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, Archbishop of Zagreb was accused after the end of World War II by Yugoslav communist authorities of supporting the Usta≈°e and of exonerating those in the clergy who collaborated with them and were hence complicit in forced conversions. Stepinac stated on 28 March 1941, noting early attempts to unite Croatians and Serbs: > \\"All in all, Croats and Serbs are of two worlds, northpole and southpole, > never will they be able to get together unless by a miracle of God. The > schism (between the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodoxy) is the greatest > curse in Europe, almost greater than Protestantism. There is no moral, no > principles, no truth, no justice, no honesty.\\"Stanojeviƒá, Branimir. Alojzije > Stepinac, zloƒçinac ili svetac: dokumenti o izdaji i zloƒçinu, Nova knjiga, > 1986, p. 51 On 22 July 2016, the Zagreb County Court annulled his post-war conviction due to \\"gross violations of current and former fundamental principles of substantive and procedural criminal law\\".Court Annuls Verdict against Cardinal Stepinac, Vedran Pavlic, Total Croatia News, 22. July 2016. In 1998 Stepinac was beatified by Pope John Paul II. On 22 June 2003 John Paul II visited Banja Luka. During the visit he held a Mass at the aforementioned Petriƒáevac monastery. This caused public uproar due to the connection of the monastery with Filipoviƒá. At the same location the Pope proclaimed the beatification of a Roman Catholic layman Ivan Merz (1896‚Äì1928), who was the founder of the \\"Association of Croatian Eagles\\" in 1923, which some view as a precursor to the Usta≈°e. Roman Catholic apologists defend the Pope's actions by stating the convent at Petriƒáevac was one of the places that went up in flames, causing the death of 80-year-old Friar Alojzije Atlija. Further, it was claimed by the apologists that the war had produced \\"a total exodus of the Catholic population from this region\\"; that the few who remained were \\"predominantly elderly\\"; and that the church in Bosnia then allegedly risked \\"total extinction\\" due to the war.  Usta≈°e-Chetnik collaboration  Usta≈°e and Domobran officers with the chetnik commander Uro≈° Drenoviƒá (left) Despite representing opposing, extreme nationalisms, when confronted with the growing strength of their common enemy (i.e. the partisans), Usta≈°e and Chetniks throughout the Independent State of Croatia signed collaboration agreements in the spring of 1942, which for the most part held until the very end of the war. The introduction to these agreements stated: > As long as there is a danger of armed partisan gangs, Chetnik formations > will voluntarily cooperate with the Croatian armed forces in fighting and > destroying the partisans and will be under the command of the Croatian armed > forces in these operations. Beyond that, the agreements specified that the NDH military will supply Chetniks with arms and ammunition, Chetniks wounded in anti-partisan operations will be treated at NDH military hospitals, and widows and orphans of killed Chetnik soldiers, will receive state financial aid equal to aid received by widows and orphans of NDH soldiers. The NDH authorities arranged for Serbs in Usta≈°e concentration camps to be released, but only on the special recommendation of Chetnik commanders (thus, not partisans and their sympathizers). On 30 June 1942, the Chief Headquarters of the Poglavnik (i.e. Ante Paveliƒá), sent a statement, signed by Marshall Slavko Kvaternik, to other NDH ministries, summarizing these agreements with NDH Chetniks. The Usta≈°e signed collaboration agreements with key NDH Chetnik commanders, in the following order: * Momƒçilo ƒêujiƒá (commander of Chetnik Dinara Division), Brane Bogunoviƒá (commander of Gavrilo Princip Corps, Dinara Division), Mane Rokviƒá (commander of King Alexander I Corps, Dinara Division), Pajica Omƒçikus (King Petar II Corps, Dinara Division) and Pajo Popoviƒá (commander of Onisin Popoviƒá Corps, Dinara Division) in December 1941 first started negotiations with the Usta≈°e mayor of Knin, David Sinƒçiƒá, in Knin. * Uro≈° Drenoviƒá, the commander of the Chetnik ¬ªKoƒçiƒá¬´ detachment, signed an agreement with the Usta≈°e in Mrkonjiƒá Grad on 27.

On 26 May 1942, the Usta≈°e minister, Mladen Lorkoviƒá, wrote in a communique to local NDH authorities, that pursuant to these agreements \\"Home Guard Headquarters agrees with your proposal to grant one million kuna aid to the leaders of the Greek-Eastern community [i.e. Serb Orthodox], Momƒçilo Djujiƒá, Mane Rokviƒá, [Branko] Bogunoviƒá, Paja Popoviƒá and Paja Omƒçikus, 200 Yugoslav guns and 10 machine guns\\". Usta≈°e and Chetniks simultaneously participated, alongside German and Italian forces, in major battles against the Partisans in the NDH: the Kozara Offensive, Case White, Operation R√∂sselsprung, the Battle for Knin (1944), etc. In 1945, the Chetnik commander, Momƒçilo Djujiƒá and his troops, with Usta≈°e leader Ante Paveliƒá's permission, escaped across the NDH to the West. In April 1945, by his own admission, Ante Paveliƒá received ‚Äútwo generals from the headquarters Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá and reached an agreement with them on a joint fight against Tito's communists\\", while in the first days of May, Chetnik units passed through Usta≈°e-held Zagreb, on their way to Bleiburg, after which Chetniks and members of the Usta≈°e army, were killed by the Partisans in various sites, including Tezno near Maribor.  Structure  At the top of the command was the Poglavnik (meaning \\"head\\") Ante Paveliƒá. Paveliƒá was appointed the office as Head of State of Croatia after Adolf Hitler had accepted Benito Mussolini's proposal of Paveliƒá, on 10 April 1941. The Croatian Home Guard was the armed forces of Croatia, it subsequently merged into the Croatian Armed Forces. Symbols Symbol used in the Independent State of Croatia The symbol of the Usta≈°e was a capital blue letter \\"U\\" with an exploding grenade emblem within it. The flag of the Independent State of Croatia was a red-white-blue horizontal tricolor with the shield of the Coat of Arms or Croatia in the middle and the U in the upper left. Its currency was the NDH kuna. The Usta≈°e greeting was \\"Za dom ‚Äì spremni!\\": : Salute: Za dom! For home(land)! : Reply: Spremni! (We are) ready! This was used instead of the Nazi greeting Heil Hitler by the Usta≈°e. Today it is nominally associated with Usta≈°e sympathisers by Serbs or non-Usta≈°e conservatives associated with the Croatian Party of Rights. However, some Croats see it as a patriotic salute, emphasising defending one's home and country. On the internet, it is sometimes abbreviated as ZDS. Legacy Young boy wearing a shirt with a Black Legion, Usta≈°e Militia sign at a Thompson concert =In popular culture= The Usta≈°e plays an important role in Harry Turtledove's short alternate history story, Ready for the Fatherland. It plays a brief background role in In the Presence of Mine Enemies, an unrelated work by the same author. In both these works, the regime founded by Paveliƒá lasted several decades beyond the 1940s. The popular Croatian singer, Thompson, regularly starts his concerts with the Usta≈°e salute. The Wiesenthal Center has protested this, along with other attempts at revisionism and Holocaust- denial in Croatia. =Modern-day Croatia= Seeking to unify support for Croatia's independence, Franjo Tuƒëman, Croatia's first president, in the late 1980s advocated \\"pomirba\\", i.e. national reconciliation between Usta≈°e and Partisans. This led to a revival of pro-Usta≈°e views, symbols and salutes among the Croatian political right. Following Croatia's Independence in the 1990s, streets were renamed to carry the name of Usta≈°e leaders, such as Mile Budak and Jure Francetiƒá. Although some of these were later removed, Radio Free Europe noted that of some 20 streets dedicated to Mile Budak in the '90s, half of these still remained in Croatia in 2019. Jewish and Serb organizations, Croat historians and antifascists, as well as international observers, have repeatedly warned of revisionism in Croatia, which seeks to minimize Usta≈°e crimes, even celebrates the Usta≈°e regime. Recent examples include the publication of a book celebrating \\"the Croatian knight\\", Maks Luburic, who as head of Usta≈°e concentration camps was responsible for over 100,000 deaths, during Usta≈°e genocides against Jews, Serbs and Roma, and a documentary minimizing children's deaths in Usta≈°e concentration camps. The Luburic book was promoted with the assistance of the Croatian Catholic Church, and Church sources minimized children's deaths in concentration camps. Croat historians have noted that the Church has been a leader in promoting revisionism and minimizing Usta≈°e crimes. In 2013, the newspaper of Croatian Catholic archdioceses, Glas Koncila, published a series on Jasenovac, by the Jasenovac-denier Igor Vukic, who claims Jasenovac was a \\"mere work-camp\\", where no mass executions took place. In 2015, the head of the Croatian Bishops' Conference asked that the Usta≈°e \\"Za dom spremni\\" salute be adopted by the Croatian army. Croatian soccer fans have repeatedly chanted the Usta≈°e, \\"Za dom spremni\\" salute, for which FIFA and UEFA have repeatedly leveled penalties against the Croatian soccer federation, for \\"fascists outburst\\". In 2014, the Croatian soccer player Josip ≈†imuniƒá was banned from the FIFA World Cup for leading a stadium full of fans in the Usta≈°e salute. In 2014 the then- mayor of Split, Croatia unveiled a monument dedicated to the 1990s HOS brigade named \\"The Knight Rafael Boban\\", after the Usta≈°e commander, which includes the HOS emblem with the Usta≈°e \\"Za dom spremni\\" salute. Since then the HOS organization has organized annual commemorations at the memorial on 10 April (the anniversary of the founding of the Usta≈°e Independent State of Croatia), during which the black-uniformed participants shout the Usta≈°e \\"Za dom spremni\\" salute. In 2016 the Croatian HOS war veterans' organization, posted a plaque at Jasenovac concentration camp with the Usta≈°e \\"Za dom spremni\\" salute. Despite protests by Jewish and other organizations, this was allowed to remain until criticism by the US State Department special envoy on Holocaust issues, forced the government to move it to a nearby town. As a result of this, and allegations of the government's tolerance for the minimization of Usta≈°e crimes, Jewish, Serb and Croat WWII resistance groups refused to appear with government representatives at the annual Jasenovac commemoration. In 2019 the Austrian government passed a law forbidding the display of Usta≈°e symbols, along with previously banned Nazi symbols, largely as a result of the display of same by Croatian nationalists at the annual, Croatian government-sponsored Bleiburg commemorations, where Austrian police have repeatedly arrested Croat nationalists for Nazi and fascist salutes. Three Austrian EU parliamentarians declared the Bleiburg ceremony, which tens- of-thousands of Croat nationalist attend, \\"the largest fascist gathering in Europe\\" The Austrian Catholic Church banned a Mass by the Croatian Catholic Church at Bleiburg because, as they stated, \\"the Mass at Bleiburg has become part of a manifestation that is politically instrumentalised and is part of a political-national ritual that serves to selectively experience and interpret history\\", adding that it misuses \\"a religious service for political purposes while not distancing itself from the Fascist worldview.\\" =Modern usage of the term \\"Usta≈°e\\"= After World War II, the Usta≈°e movement was split into several organizations and there is presently no political or paramilitary movement that claims its legacy as their \\"successor\\". The term \\"usta≈°e\\" is today used as a derogatory term for Croatian ultranationalism. The term \\"Usta≈°e\\" is sometimes used among Serbs to describe Serbophobia or more generally to defame political opponents. =Use by Serbian nationalists= Since the end of World War II, Serbian historians have used the Usta≈°e to promote that Serbs resisted the Axis, while Croats and Bosniaks widely supported them. However, the Usta≈°e never received massive support from ordinary Croats. The Usta≈°e regime was backed by parts of the Croatian population that during the interwar period had felt oppressed in the Serbian- led Yugoslavia. Most of the support it had initially gained by creating a Croat national state was lost because of the brutal practices it used. In the 1980s, Serbian historians produced many works about the forced conversion during World War II of Serbs to Catholicism in Usta≈°e Croatia. These debates between historians openly became nationalistic and also entered the wider media. Historians in Belgrade during the 1980s who had close government connections often went on television during the evenings to discuss invented or real details about the Usta≈°e genocide against Serbs during World War II. Serb clergy and nationalists blamed all Croats for crimes committed by the Usta≈°e, and for planning a genocide against Serb people. These propagandistic activities were aimed at justifying planned crimes and ethno-demographic engineering in Croatia.

A secure environment is achieved not only by the design concepts of these operating systems, but also through vigilant user and administrative practices. Design concepts =Permissions= A core security feature in these systems is the file system permissions. All files in a typical Unix filesystem have permissions set enabling different access to a file. Permissions on a file are commonly set using the chmod command and seen through the ls command. For example: -r-xr-xr-x 1 root wheel 745720 Sep 8 2002 /bin/sh Unix permissions permit different users access to a file. Different user groups have different permissions on a file. More advanced Unix filesystems include the Access Control List concept which allows permissions to be granted to multiple users or groups. An Access Control List may be used to grant permission to additional individual users or groups. For example: /pvr [u::rwx,g::r-x,o::r-x/u::rwx,u:sue:rwx,g::r-x,m::rwx,o::r-x] In this example, which is from the chacl command on the Linux operating system, the user sue is granted write permission to the /pvr directory. =User groups= Users under Unix style operating systems often belong to managed groups with specific access permissions. This enables users to be grouped by the level of access they have to this system. Many Unix implementations add an additional layer of security by requiring that a user be a member of the wheel user privileges group in order to access the \`su\` command. =Root access= Most Unix and Unix-like systems have an account or group which enables a user to exact complete control over the system, often known as a root account. If access to this account is gained by an unwanted user, this results in a complete breach of the system. A root account however is necessary for administrative purposes, and for the above security reasons the root account is seldom used for day to day purposes (the sudo program is more commonly used), so usage of the root account can be more closely monitored. Root access \\"as it should be\\" can be visualised by those familiar with the Superman stories using the following analogy: ::Using a root account is rather like being Superman; an administrator's regular user is more like Clark Kent. Clark Kent becomes Superman for only as long as necessary, in order to save people. He then reverts to his \\"disguise\\". Root access should be used in the same fashion. The Clark Kent disguise doesn't really restrict him though, as he is still able to use his super powers. This is analogous to using the sudo program. User and administrative techniques Unix has many tools that can improve security if used properly by users and administrators. =Passwords= Selecting a strong password and guarding it properly are probably the most important things a user can do to improve Unix security. In Unix systems, the essential information about users is stored under the file \`/etc/passwd\`This file keeps track of the users registered in the system and their main definitions. Passwords, or more correctly, the hash of the password, can also be stored in the same place. The entries in \`/etc/passwd\` occupy exactly one line each, and have the following form: nickname:password_hash:UserID:GroupID:Complete_Name:home_dir:shell_bin An example would be: xfze:$$1zuW2nX3sslp3qJm9MYDdglEApAc36r/:1000:100:Daniel Ernesto Ortiz Costa:/home/xfze:/bin/bash Since all users must have read access to the \`/etc/passwd\` file to do many common tasks (\`ls -l /home\` will use \`/etc/passwd\` to map UIDs to login names for example), anyone could also read the password hashes of other users. To solve this problem, the file \`/etc/shadow\` was created to store the password hashes, with only root having read access. Under password shadowing, the 2nd field (password hash) is replaced by an 'x' which tells the system to retrieve the corresponding user's password via the \`/etc/shadow\` file. The \`/etc/shadow\` file often only contains values for the first two fields: xfze:$$1zuW2nX3sslp3qJm9MYDdglEApAc36r/::::: The remaining fields in the \`/etc/shadow\` file include: #The minimum number of days between password changes #The maximum number of days until the password must be changed #The number of days of warning given before the password must be changed #The number of days after the password must be changed when the account becomes unusable #The date (expressed as the number of days since January 1st, 1970) when the account is expired These fields may be used to improve Unix security by enforcing a password security policy. =Users and accounts= Administrators should delete old accounts promptly. *su, sudo, ssh only, no remote root logins Software maintenance =Patching= Operating systems, like all software, may contain bugs in need of fixing or may be enhanced with the addition of new features. Patching the operating system in a secure manner requires that the software come from a trustworthy source and not have been altered since it was packaged. Common methods for verifying that operating system patches have not been altered include the use of cryptographic hash, such as an MD5 based checksum, or the use of read-only media. From a security standpoint, the specific packaging method, such as the RPM Package Manager format originally from Red Hat Linux is not as important as the use of features which ensure the integrity of the patch itself. Source distributions Source distributions include the ability to examine the code for suspicious content. The drawback, absent an accompanying cryptographic hash value, is that the user must be able to perform a security analysis of the code themselves. RPM packages Linux distributions which use the RPM Package Manager format for providing base functionality and software updates make use of MD5 and GPG to ensure content integrity. The hash values are packaged with the RPM file and verified when the package is installed. Debian packages Linux distributions which use the Debian .deb package format for providing base functionality and software updates make use of GPG signatures to ensure content integrity. A signature is computed when the package is constructed and verified later when the package is installed. Other vendors and distributions Regardless of the vendor or distribution, all software distributions should provide a mechanism for verifying that the software is legitimate and has not been modified since it was originally packaged. Services Unnecessary system software should not be installed or configured on a system. Software which is no longer required should be removed completely, if possible. *Identify what services are running **netstat -na **lsof **nmap **sockstat -4 (FreeBSD) The commands inetd and xinetd act as super-servers for a variety of network protocols such as rlogin, telnet and ftp. Turning off unnecessary services *using update-rc.d on Debian *using chkconfig on Red Hat Linux *using /etc/rc.conf and /usr/local/etc/rc.d on FreeBSD (mention /etc/rc.local) *using rc-update on Gentoo Linux This approach is usually called proactive security. There are some operating systems which are secure by default. Amongst others, the free BSD flavours (FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD) are proactively secure. For example, the output of netstat on a NetBSD 3.0 workstation clearly outlines this technique: $ netstat -a Active Internet connections (including servers) Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address Foreign Address State tcp 0 0 localhost.smtp *.* LISTEN tcp 0 0 *.ssh *.* LISTEN Active Internet6 connections (including servers) Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address Foreign Address (state) tcp6 0 0 localhost.smtp *.* LISTEN tcp6 0 0 *.ssh *.* LISTEN Active UNIX domain sockets Address Type Recv-Q Send-Q Inode Conn Refs Nextref Addr c0d10d80 dgram 0 0 0 c0cd8680 0 c0cb7000 -> /var/run/log c0cb7000 dgram 0 0 0 c0cd8680 0 0 -> /var/run/log c0cd8680 dgram 0 0 cb9639e8 0 c0d10d80 0 /var/run/log The following example from a BSD system $ sockstat -4 USER COMMAND PID FD PROTO LOCAL ADDRESS FOREIGN ADDRESS root sendmail 569 4 tcp localhost.smtp *.* root sshd 593 4 tcp *.ssh *.* Shows that on this machine only the SSH service is listening to the public network interface of the computer. sendmail is listening to the loopback interface only. Access to a service may be further restricted by using a firewall. File systems =File system security= File system security within UNIX and Unix-like systems is based on 9 permission bits, set user and group ID bits, and the sticky bit, for a total of 12 bits. These permissions apply almost equally to all filesystem objects such as files, directories and devices. The 9 permission bits are divided into three groups of three bits each. The first group describes the permissions of the file owner, the second group describes the permissions of a group associated with the file owner or the directory containing the file, and the third group describes the permissions associated with any process which does not have the same user ID as the file. Each group of three bits contains a bit indicating the read, write or execute access is granted. In the case of directories, execute access is interpreted as the permission to perform a filename lookup within the directory. The set user ID and set group ID bits, commonly abbreviated set-UID and set-GID respectively, are used to change the identity of the process which executes a file having either or both of those bits set. A file having the set-UID permission bit set will cause a process which executes that file to temporarily switch the effective user ID to that of the file owner. A file having the set-GID permission bit set will cause a process which executes that file to temporarily switch the effective group ID to that of the file group. A process may then alternate between the effective user or group ID which it inherited from the file and the real user or group ID which it inherited when the user logged on to the system. This provides a mechanism by which a process may limit the access rights it possesses to those code regions which require those access rights. This is a form of a security technique known as privilege separation and improves program security by limiting the unintended or undesirable actions of a processes. A directory having the set-GID permission bit set will cause a newly created file to have an initial file group value equal to the file group of the directory. This provides a mechanism whereby a subsystem, such as the system's mail subsystem, can create files which have a common file group value so that set-GID processes within that subsystem are then able to read or write the file. The sticky bit, formally known as the save text on swap bit, derives its name from its original purpose. Originally the sticky bit caused a process's initial memory image to be stored as a contiguous image on the disk drive which was used to store real memory pages when they were not in use. This improved the performance of commonly executed commands by making the initial memory image readily available. Modern UNIX systems no longer perform that function when the bit is set, but the name has been preserved nonetheless. In the case of files, the sticky-bit may be used by the system to indicate the style of file locking to be performed. In the case of directories, the sticky bit prevents any process, other than one which has super-user privileges or one having an effective user ID of the file owner, from deleting a file within that directory. The sticky bit is most commonly used on publicly writable directories, such as the various temporary working space directories on the system. =Root squash= Root squash is a special mapping of the remote superuser (root) identity when using identity authentication (local user is the same as remote user). Under root squash, a client's uid 0 (root) is mapped to 65534 (nobody). It is primarily a feature of NFS but may be available on other systems as well. Root squash is a technique to void privilege escalation on the client machine via suid executables Setuid. Without root squash, an attacker can generate suid binaries on the server that are executed as root on other client, even if the client user does not have superuser privileges. Hence it protects client machines against other malicious clients. It does not protect clients against a malicious server (where root can generate suid binaries), nor does it protect the files of any user other than root (as malicious clients can impersonate any user). SELinux SELinux is the set of kernel extensions to control access more precisely, strictly defining both if and how files, folders, network ports and other resources can be accessed by the confined process. This system is mostly used to restrict processes (database, server) rather than human users. It can also limit processes that run as root. Other distributions use comparable alternatives like AppArmor. Viruses and virus scanners Unix-like operating systems are immune to most Microsoft Windows viruses because binaries created to run on Windows generally won't run on other platforms. However, many Unix like installations provide file storage services to Microsoft Windows clients, such as through the use of Samba software, and may unintentionally become a repository for viruses stored by users. It is common for Unix servers to act as mail transfer agents; consequently; email virus scanning is often installed. The ClamAV virus scanner is available in source code form and may be used to scan Unix file systems for viruses which infect other operating systems. There are viruses and worms that target Unix-like operating systems. In fact, the first computer worm‚Äîthe Morris worm‚Äîtargeted Unix systems. Firewalls Network firewall protects systems and networks from network threats which exist on the opposite side of the firewall. Firewalls can block access to strictly internal services, unwanted users and in some cases filter network traffic by content. =iptables= iptables is the current user interface for interacting with Linux kernel netfilter functionality. It replaced ipchains. Other Unix like operating systems may provide their own native functionality and other open source firewall products exist. More detailed information about iptables is contained elsewhere. A brief discussion is contained here in order to describe how iptables may be used to configure a Linux firewall. netfilter provides a state-full packet filter which can be configured according to network interface, protocol, source and/or destination address, source and/or destination port and the state of the packet. A network packet traverses several chains between the time it is received by a network interface and the time it is accepted by the host or forwarded to another host. The common chains are INPUT, OUTPUT and FORWARD. The INPUT chain is traversed for all packets as they are received by a network interface, regardless of whether they are to be accepted by the host or forwarded to another host. The OUTPUT chain is traversed for all packets as they are transmitted by a network interface. The FORWARD chain is traversed for those packets are being routed through the host from one network interface to another, such as is the case for a multi-homed system (a system with more than one physical network interface). Each of the built-in chains has a default policy which defines what action is taken for a packet which reaches the end of the chain. Packet traversal ends when a rule matches the packet and has an action of ACCEPT, DROP, REJECT or RETURN. The simplest iptables firewall consists of rules for each desired service, followed by a rule which indicates that any packets which reach this rule are dropped. A system which only permitted, for example, incoming email traffic would have a rule which accepted connections on the SMTP port, and then dropped others. A rule would be required which indicated that all established connections were also permitted so that outgoing connections would receive responses from other systems. INPUT chain The following example shows a simple packet filter for the INPUT chain for the above described example: Chain INPUT (policy DROP 0 packets, 0 bytes) pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination 0 0 ACCEPT all‚Äîany any anywhere anywhere state ESTABLISHED 0 0 ACCEPT tcp‚Äîany any anywhere anywhere tcp dpt:smtp 0 0 LOG all‚Äîany any anywhere anywhere LOG level warning 0 0 DROP all‚Äîany any anywhere anywhere The addition of an explicit DROP action ensures that the packets are discarded should the default policy of the INPUT chain accidentally be changed to ACCEPT. OUTPUT chain There is less need for an OUTPUT chain and the default policy of the OUTPUT chain can safely be set to ACCEPT. In some instances it may be desirable for a firewall to limit certain outgoing connections to a certain set of approved systems. This is known as egress filtering and may be used to prevent viruses within the firewall from escaping to other systems. For example, it may be the policy of a network to limit outgoing email connections to a single authorized email servers as a way of combating e-mail spam. This could be achieved by the following example: Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT) pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination 0 0 DROP tcp‚Äîany any !server anywhere tcp dpt:smtp There is no need to include any other rules in this example as the default policy for the OUTPUT chain is ACCEPT. This rule assumes that the host which is acting as the firewall will not be sending email itself, such as to the email server. This is a good assumption as typically a firewall system contains the minimal amount of system code needed to act as a firewall. A more restrictive OUTPUT chain would contain permissive (ACCEPT) entries for those services which may be accessed outside the firewall and then a restrictive (DROP) policy for the chain itself.

Futures contracts are derivatives contracts to buy or sell specific quantities of a commodity or financial instrument at a specified price with delivery set at a specified time in the future. Futures exchanges provides physical or electronic trading venues, details of standardized contracts, market and price data, clearing houses, exchange self-regulations, margin mechanisms, settlement procedures, delivery times, delivery procedures and other services to foster trading in futures contracts. Futures exchanges can be organized as non-profit member-owned organizations or as for-profit organizations. Futures exchanges can be integrated under the same brand name or organization with other types of exchanges, such as stock markets, options markets, and bond markets. Non-profit member-owned futures exchanges benefit their members, who earn commissions and revenue acting as brokers or market makers. For-profit futures exchanges earn most of their revenue from trading and clearing fees. Role in futures contracts standardization Futures exchanges establishes standardized contracts for trading on their trading venues, and they usually specifies the following: assets to be delivered in the contract, delivery arrangements, delivery months, pricing formula for daily and final settlement, contract size, and price position and limits. For assets to be delivered, futures exchanges usually specify one or more grades of a commodity acceptable for delivery and for any price adjustments applied to delivery. For example, the standard deliverable grade for CME Group‚Äôs corn futures contract is \\"No. 2 Yellow\\", but holders of short positions in the contract can deliver \\"No. 3 Yellow\\" corn for 1.5 cents less the delivery price per bushel. The location where assets are delivered are also specified by the futures exchanges, and they may also specify alternative delivery locations and any price adjustments available when delivering to alternative locations. Delivery locations accommodate the particular delivery, storage, and marketing needs of the deliverable asset. For example, ICE frozen concentrate orange juice contracts specify delivery locations as exchange-licensed warehouses in Florida, New Jersey, or Delaware, while in the case of CME live cattle contracts, delivery is to exchange-approved livestock yards and slaughter plants in the Midwest. The futures exchange also determines the amount of deliverable assets for each contract, which determines a contract's size. Contract sizes that are too large will dissuade trading and hedging of small positions, while contract sizes that are too small will increase transaction costs since there are costs associated with each contract. In some cases, futures exchanges have created \\"mini\\" contracts to attract smaller traders. For example, the CME Group‚Äôs Mini Nasdaq 100 contract is on 20 times the Nasdaq 100 index. Clearing and margin mechanisms Futures exchanges provide access to clearing houses that stands in the middle of every trade. Suppose trader A purchases $145,000 of gold futures contracts from trader B, trader A really bought a futures contract to buy $145,000 of gold from the clearing house at a future time, and trader B really has a contract to sell $145,000 to the clearing house at that same time. Since the clearing house took on the obligation of both sides of that trade, trader A do not have worry about trader B becoming unable or unwilling to settle the contract - they do not have to worry about trader B's credit risk. Trader A only has to worry about the ability of the clearing house to fulfill their contracts. Even though clearing houses are exposed to every trade on the exchange, they have more tools to manage credit risk. Clearing houses can issue Margin Calls to demand traders to deposit Initial Margin moneys when they open a position, and deposit Variation Margin (or Mark-to- Market Margin) moneys when existing positions experience daily losses. A margin in general is collateral that the holder of a financial instrument has to deposit to cover some or all of the credit risk of their counterparty, in this case the central counterparty clearing houses. Traders on both sides of a trade has to deposit Initial Margin, and this amount is kept by the clearing house and not remitted to other traders. Clearing houses calculate day-to-day profit and loss amounts by 'marking-to-market' all positions by setting their new cost to the previous day's settlement value, and computing the difference between their current day settlement value and new cost. When traders accumulate losses on their position such that the balance of their existing posted margin and their new debits from losses is below a thresh-hold called a maintenance margin (usually a fraction of the initial margin) at the end of a day, they have to send Variation Margin to the exchange who passes that money to traders making profits on the opposite side of that position. When traders accumulate profits on their positions such that their margin balance is above the maintenance margin, they are entitled to withdraw the excess balance. The margin system ensures that on any given day, if all parties in a trade closed their positions after variation margin payments after settlement, nobody would need to make any further payments as the losing side of the position would have already sent the whole amount they owe to the profiting side of the position. The clearinghouse do not keep any variation margin. When traders cannot pay the variation margin they owe or are otherwise in default the clearing house closes their positions and tries to cover their remaining obligations to other traders using their posted initial margin and any reserves available to the clearing house. Several popular methods are used to compute initial margins. They include the CME-owned SPAN (a grid simulation method used by the CME and about 70 other exchanges), STANS (a Monte Carlo simulation based methodology used by the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC)), TIMS (earlier used by the OCC, and still being used by a few other exchanges). Traders do not interact directly with the exchange, they interact with clearing house members, usually futures brokers, that pass contracts and margin payments on to the exchange. Clearing house members are directly responsible for initial margin and variation margin requirements at the exchange even if their clients default on their obligations, so they may require more initial margin (but not variation margin) from their clients than is required by the exchange to protect themselves. Since clearing house members usually have many clients, they can net out margin payments from their client's offsetting positions. For example, if a clearing house member have half of their clients holding a total of 1000 long position in a contract, and half of their clients holding a total of 500 short position in a contract, the clearing house member is only responsible for the initial and variation margin of a net 500 contracts. Nature of contracts Exchange-traded contracts are standardized by the exchanges where they trade. The contract details what asset is to be bought or sold, and how, when, where and in what quantity it is to be delivered. The terms also specify the currency in which the contract will trade, minimum tick value, and the last trading day and expiry or delivery month. Standardized commodity futures contracts may also contain provisions for adjusting the contracted price based on deviations from the \\"standard\\" commodity, for example, a contract might specify delivery of heavier USDA Number 1 oats at par value but permit delivery of Number 2 oats for a certain seller's penalty per bushel. Before the market opens on the first day of trading a new futures contract, there is a specification but no actual contracts exist. Futures contracts are not issued like other securities, but are \\"created\\" whenever Open interest increases; that is, when one party first buys (goes long) a contract from another party (who goes short). Contracts are also \\"destroyed\\" in the opposite manner whenever open interest decreases because traders resell to reduce their long positions or rebuy to reduce their short positions. Speculators on futures price fluctuations who do not intend to make or take ultimate delivery must take care to \\"zero their positions\\" prior to the contract's expiry. After expiry, each contract will be settled, either by physical delivery (typically for commodity underlyings) or by a cash settlement (typically for financial underlyings). The contracts ultimately are not between the original buyer and the original seller, but between the holders at expiry and the exchange. Because a contract may pass through many hands after it is created by its initial purchase and sale, or even be liquidated, settling parties do not know with whom they have ultimately traded. Regulators Each exchange is normally regulated by a national governmental (or semi-governmental) regulatory agency: * In Australia, this role is performed by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. * In the Chinese mainland, by the China Securities Regulatory Commission. * In Hong Kong, by the Securities and Futures Commission. * In India, by the Securities and Exchange Board of India * In South Korea, by the Financial Supervisory Service. * In Japan, by the Financial Services Agency. * In Pakistan, by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan. * In Singapore by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. * In the UK, futures exchanges are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. * In the US, by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. * In Malaysia, by the Securities Commission Malaysia. * In Spain, by the Comisi√≥n Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV). * In Brazil, by the Comiss√£o de Valores Mobili√°rios (CVM). * In South Africa, by the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (South Africa). * In Mauritius, by the Financial Services Commission (FSC) * In Indonesia, by the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (BAPPEPTI) History =Ancient times= In Ancient Mesopotamia, around 1750 BC, the sixth Babylonian king, Hammurabi, created one of the first legal codes: the Code of Hammurabi. Hammurabi's Code allowed sales of goods and assets to be delivered for an agreed price at a future date; required contracts to be in writing and witnessed; and allowed assignment of contracts. The code facilitated the first derivatives, in the form of forward and futures contracts. An active derivatives market existed, with trading carried out at temples. One of the earliest written records of futures trading is in Aristotle's Politics. He tells the story of Thales, a poor philosopher from Miletus who developed a \\"financial device, which involves a principle of universal application\\". Thales used his skill in forecasting and predicted that the olive harvest would be exceptionally good the next autumn. Confident in his prediction, he made agreements with local olive-press owners to deposit his money with them to guarantee him exclusive use of their olive presses when the harvest was ready. Thales successfully negotiated low prices because the harvest was in the future and no one knew whether the harvest would be plentiful or pathetic and because the olive-press owners were willing to hedge against the possibility of a poor yield. When the harvest-time came, and a sharp increase in demand for the use of the olive presses outstripped supply (availability of the presses), he sold his future use contracts of the olive presses at a rate of his choosing, and made a large amount of money.Aristotle, Politics, trans. Benjamin Jowett, vol. 2, The Great Books of the Western World, book 1, chap. 11, p. 453. This is a very loose example of futures trading and, in fact, more closely resembles an option contract, given that Thales was not obliged to use the olive presses if the yield was poor. =Modern era= The first modern organized futures exchange began in 1710 at the Dojima Rice Exchange in Osaka, Japan. The London Metal Market and Exchange Company (London Metal Exchange) was founded in 1877, but the market traces its origins back to 1571 and the opening of the Royal Exchange, London. Before the exchange was created, business was conducted by traders in London coffee houses using a makeshift ring drawn in chalk on the floor.BBC Radio 4 Today, broadcast 25 October 2011. At first only copper was traded. Lead and zinc were soon added but only gained official trading status in 1920. The exchange was closed during World War II and did not re-open until 1952.The exchange was closed during World War II and did not re-open until 1952 http://blog.steinerelectric.com/2014/04/what-is-the-london-metals-exchange/ The range of metals traded was extended to include aluminium (1978), nickel (1979), tin (1989), aluminium alloy (1992), steel (2008), and minor metals cobalt and molybdenum (2010). The exchange ceased trading plastics in 2011. The total value of the trade is around $11.6 trillion annually. Chicago has the largest future exchange in the world, the CME Group. Chicago is located at the base of the Great Lakes, close to the farmlands and cattle country of the Midwest, making it a natural center for transportation, distribution, and trading of agricultural produce. Gluts and shortages of these products caused chaotic fluctuations in price, and this led to the development of a market enabling grain merchants, processors, and agriculture companies to trade in \\"to arrive\\" or \\"cash forward\\" contracts to insulate them from the risk of adverse price change and enable them to hedge. In March 2008 the CME announced its acquisition of NYMEX Holdings, Inc., the parent company of the New York Mercantile Exchange and Commodity Exchange. CME's acquisition of NYMEX was completed in August 2008. For most exchanges, forward contracts were standard at the time. However, forward contracts were often not honored by either the buyer or the seller. For instance, if the buyer of a corn forward contract made an agreement to buy corn, and at the time of delivery the price of corn differed dramatically from the original contract price, either the buyer or the seller would back out. Additionally, the forward contracts market was very illiquid and an exchange was needed that would bring together a market to find potential buyers and sellers of a commodity instead of making people bear the burden of finding a buyer or seller. In 1848 the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) was formed. Trading was originally in forward contracts; the first contract (on corn) was written on March 13, 1851. In 1865 standardized futures contracts were introduced. The Chicago Produce Exchange was established in 1874, renamed the Chicago Butter and Egg Board in 1898 and then reorganised into the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) in 1919. Following the end of the postwar international gold standard, in 1972 the CME formed a division called the International Monetary Market (IMM) to offer futures contracts in foreign currencies: British pound, Canadian dollar, German mark, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, and Swiss franc. In 1881 a regional market was founded in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and in 1883 introduced futures for the first time. Trading continuously since then, today the Minneapolis Grain Exchange (MGEX) is the only exchange for hard red spring wheat futures and options. and and Futures trading used to be very active in India in the early to late 19th Century in the Marwari business community. Several families made their fortunes in opium futures trading in Calcutta and Bombay. There are records available of standardized opium futures contracts made in the 1870-1880s in Calcutta. There are strong grounds to believe that commodity futures could have existed in India for thousands of years before then, with references to the existence of market operations similar to the modern day futures market in Kautilya's Arthashastra written in the 2nd century BCE. The first organised futures market was established in 1875 by the Bombay Cotton Trade Association to trade in cotton contracts. This occurred soon after the establishment of trading in cotton Futures in UK, as Bombay was a very important hub for cotton trade in the British Empire. Futures trading in raw jute and jute goods began in Calcutta with the establishment of the Calcutta Hessian Exchange Ltd., in 1919. In modern times, most of the futures trading happens in the National Multi commodity Exchange (NMCE) which commenced futures trading in 24 commodities on 26 November 2002 on a national scale. Currently (August 2007) 62 commodities are being traded on the NMCE. =Recent developments= The 1970s saw the development of the financial futures contracts, which allowed trading in the future value of interest rates. These (in particular the 90‚Äëday Eurodollar contract introduced in 1981) had an enormous impact on the development of the interest rate swap market. Today, the futures markets have far outgrown their agricultural origins. With the addition of the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) the trading and hedging of financial products using futures dwarfs the traditional commodity markets, and plays a major role in the global financial system, trading over $1.5 trillion per day in 2005.Notional volume in interest rate derivatives for 2005 was nearly $1.5 trillion, 85% of which came from 260 institutions trading more than $1 billion each http://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/07/derivatives_retail.asp The recent history of these exchanges (Aug 2006) finds the Chicago Mercantile Exchange trading more than 70% of its Futures contracts on its \\"Globex\\" trading platform and this trend is rising daily. It counts for over $45.5 billion of nominal trade (over 1 million contracts) every single day in \\"electronic trading\\" as opposed to open outcry trading of futures, options and derivatives. In June 2001 Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) acquired the International Petroleum Exchange (IPE), now ICE Futures, which operated Europe's leading open-outcry energy futures exchange. Since 2003 ICE has partnered with the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) to host its electronic marketplace. In April 2005 the entire ICE portfolio of energy futures became fully electronic. In 2005, The Africa Mercantile Exchange (AfMX¬Æ) became the first African commodities market to implement an automated system for the dissemination of market data and information online in real-time through a wide network of computer terminals. As at the end of 2007, AfMX¬Æ had developed a system of secure data storage providing online services for brokerage firms. The year 2010, saw the exchange unveil a novel system of electronic trading, known as After¬Æ. After¬Æ extends the potential volume of processing of information and allows the Exchange to increase its overall volume of trading activities. In 2006 the New York Stock Exchange teamed up with the Amsterdam- Brussels-Lisbon-Paris Exchanges \\"Euronext\\" electronic exchange to form the first transcontinental futures and options exchange. These two developments as well as the sharp growth of internet futures trading platforms developed by a number of trading companies clearly points to a race to total internet trading of futures and options in the coming years. In terms of trading volume, the National Stock Exchange of India in Mumbai is the largest stock futures trading exchange in the world.

Then model (later actress) Ali Larter portrayed the imaginary actress in Sherrill's feature, which appeared in Esquire (November 1996).  History  In a parody of celebrity profiles, the article described Coleman's role in an upcoming movie with Woody Allen, her tempestuous relationship with David Schwimmer (including a scandal involving nude photographs taken by paparazzi), and her friendship with Deepak Chopra. She is said to be 22 years old, the daughter of \\"pop-art photographer Max A.F. Coleman\\" (who left the marriage and family in 1981) and actress \\"Kay Garland, who played the spoiled daughter in Mildred Pierce\\". In real life, that specific role in Mildred Pierce had been played by Ann Blyth, whose life in no way resembled the fictional Kay Garland's. (Garland is said to have abandoned her family in 1985, leaving Allegra, then 11, to raise her siblings with assistance from an aunt, a grandmother, and friends.) Coleman was married briefly at 17 to \\"Mike Mumy\\", the (fictional) brother of actor Billy Mumy. Within the context of the article, Coleman is already a successful actress, having appeared in the TV series Melrose Place, and the films Down Periscope, Guarding Tess and Cliffhanger, amongst others. Also within the context of the article, her life has been the subject of tabloid reportage and speculation for some time. By the end of the article, in a surrealistic turn, serious ambiguities are raised about Allegra's actual existence, as she seems to have disappeared after a car crash and it's noted that \\"We would always have her, and the idea of her ‚Äî this glorious, young, alive vision ‚Äî which is all we want in the end, it turns out. Actual existence was a minor issue.\\" The many deliberate (and easily spotted) inaccuracies were meant to be indicative that the article was a satire of a typically breathless style of celebrity profile articles, and indeed Salon magazine identified the article as a hoax immediately upon publication. The hoax was formally revealed by Esquire editor Edward Kosner in a press release to the news wire services. The article was photographed by photographer Troy House, who knew Ali Larter from previous jobs and approached her about doing the parody. Sherrill later wrote a satirical novel on Hollywood life that was essentially both an expansion and continuation of the original \\"Dream Girl\\" article, and featured Allegra Coleman as a prominent character. The novel, My Last Movie Star, was published by Random House in 2003. Reaction Some response to the affair focused on its ethics; Schwimmer's friends were reported to have complained about the invasion of privacy involved in using the actor's fame. Writing in Salon, David Futrelle commented that the article seemed to hearken back to Esquire's mid-1960s heyday. The article written about Coleman as the new \\"It Girl\\" prompted calls from studios and talent scouts eager to offer Coleman scripts. The incident jump-started Ali Larter's acting career, and she went on to appear in TV shows (including the Niki Sanders role in NBC's Heroes) and movies (including Varsity Blues, Legally Blonde, and Final Destination).

Neighboring districts are (clockwise from north) Rastatt, Freudenstadt, Rottweil, Schwarzwald-Baar and Emmendingen. To the west it borders the French Bas-Rhin d√©partement. History The district was created in 1973 by merging the districts of Kehl, Lahr, Offenburg, Wolfach and the southern part of the district of B√ºhl. Geography The western part of the district is located in the Upper Rhine Valley, the eastern part belongs to the northern Black Forest. The highest elevation of the district, the Hornisgrinde (1164 m), is located in the north-east of the district. The lowest elevation (124.3 m) is in the Rhine valley to the north. The district is named after the historical territory of the Ortenau. Partnerships The district has a friendship with the Altenburger Land district in Thuringia. Offenburg district already had a city partnership with Altenburg so, after German reunification in 1990, Ortenaukreis chose to help modernize the Altenburger Land administration to the West German standard. France and Germany have created the Strasbourg-Ortenau eurodistrict straddling the Rhine and combining Ortenaukreis and Greater Strasbourg, with an overall population of 860,000.

Just as linear algebra is built on the concept of a vector and develops the theory of vector spaces, multilinear algebra builds on the concepts of p-vectors and multivectors with Grassmann algebra. Origin In a vector space of dimension n, one usually considers only the vectors. According to Hermann Grassmann and others, this presumption misses the complexity of considering the structures of pairs, triples, and general multivectors. Since there are several combinatorial possibilities, the space of multivectors turns out to have 2n dimensions. The abstract formulation of the determinant is the most immediate application. Multilinear algebra also has applications in mechanical study of material response to stress and strain with various moduli of elasticity. This practical reference led to the use of the word tensor to describe the elements of the multilinear space. The extra structure in a multilinear space has led it to play an important role in various studies in higher mathematics. Though Grassmann started the subject in 1844 with his Ausdehnungslehre, and republished in 1862, his work was slow to find acceptance as ordinary linear algebra provided sufficient challenges to comprehension. The topic of multilinear algebra is applied in some studies of multivariate calculus and manifolds where the Jacobian matrix comes into play. The infinitesimal differentials of single variable calculus become differential forms in multivariate calculus, and their manipulation is done with exterior algebra. After Grassmann, developments in multilinear algebra were made in 1872 by Victor Schlegel when he published the first part of his System der Raumlehre, and by Elwin Bruno Christoffel. A major advance in multilinear algebra came in the work of Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro and Tullio Levi-Civita (see references). It was the absolute differential calculus form of multilinear algebra that Marcel Grossmann and Michele Besso introduced to Albert Einstein. The publication in 1915 by Einstein of a general relativity explanation for the precession of the perihelion of Mercury, established multilinear algebra and tensors as physically important mathematics. Use in algebraic topology Around the middle of the 20th century the study of tensors was reformulated more abstractly. The Bourbaki group's treatise Multilinear Algebra was especially influential--in fact the term multilinear algebra was probably coined there. One reason at the time was a new area of application, homological algebra. The development of algebraic topology during the 1940s gave additional incentive for the development of a purely algebraic treatment of the tensor product. The computation of the homology groups of the product of two topological spaces involves the tensor product; but only in the simplest cases, such as a torus, is it directly calculated in that fashion (see K√ºnneth theorem). The topological phenomena were subtle enough to need better foundational concepts; technically speaking, the Tor functors had to be defined. The material to organise was quite extensive, including also ideas going back to Hermann Grassmann, the ideas from the theory of differential forms that had led to de Rham cohomology, as well as more elementary ideas such as the wedge product that generalises the cross product. The resulting rather severe write-up of the topic (by Bourbaki) entirely rejected one approach in vector calculus (the quaternion route, that is, in the general case, the relation with Lie groups). They instead applied a novel approach using category theory, with the Lie group approach viewed as a separate matter. Since this leads to a much cleaner treatment, there was probably no going back in purely mathematical terms. (Strictly, the universal property approach was invoked; this is somewhat more general than category theory, and the relationship between the two as alternate ways was also being clarified, at the same time.) Indeed, what was done is almost precisely to explain that tensor spaces are the constructions required to reduce multilinear problems to linear problems. This purely algebraic attack conveys no geometric intuition. Its benefit is that by re-expressing problems in terms of multilinear algebra, there is a clear and well-defined \\"best solution\\": the constraints the solution exerts are exactly those you need in practice. In general there is no need to invoke any ad hoc construction, geometric idea, or recourse to co- ordinate systems. In the category-theoretic jargon, everything is entirely natural.  Conclusion on the abstract approach  In principle the abstract approach can recover everything done via the traditional approach. In practice this may not seem so simple. On the other hand, the notion of naturality is consistent with the general covariance principle of general relativity. The latter deals with tensor fields (tensors varying from point to point on a manifold), but covariance asserts that the language of tensors is essential to the proper formulation of general relativity. Some decades later the rather abstract view coming from category theory was tied up with the approach that had been developed in the 1930s by Hermann Weyl (by working through general relativity via abstract tensor analysis, and additionally in his book The Classical Groups). In a way this took the theory full circle, connecting once more the content of old and new viewpoints.

Their long bills allow them to probe deeply in the sand for aquatic worms and molluscs. In their winter range, they flock together where food is plentiful. They frequent tidal shorelines, breeding in northern climates in summer and migrating south in winter. A female bar-tailed godwit made a flight of 29,000 km (18,000 mi), flying of it without stopping. In 2020 a male bar-tailed godwit flew about non-stop in its migration from Alaska to New Zealand, a record for avian non- stop flight. The godwits can be distinguished from the curlews by their straight or slightly upturned bills, and from the dowitchers by their longer legs. The winter plumages are fairly drab, but three species have reddish underparts when breeding. The females are appreciably larger than the males. Godwits were once a popular British dish. Sir Thomas Browne writing in about 1682 noted that godwits \\"were accounted the daintiest dish in England\\". A flock of migratory waders, dominated by bar-tailed godwit Taxonomy The genus Limosa was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 with the black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa) as the type species. The genus name Limosa is from Latin and means \\"muddy\\", from limus, \\"mud\\". The English name was first recorded in about 1416‚Äì17 and is believed to imitate the bird's call. The genus contains four species: * Black-tailed godwit, Limosa limosa * Hudsonian godwit, Limosa haemastica * Bar-tailed godwit, Limosa lapponica * Marbled godwit, Limosa fedoa Fossil species In addition, there are two or three species of fossil prehistoric godwits. Limosa vanrossemi is known from the Monterey Formation (Late Miocene, approx. 6 mya) of Lompoc, United States. Limosa lacrimosa is known from the Early Pliocene of Western Mongolia (Kurochkin, 1985). Limosa gypsorum of the Late Eocene (Montmartre Formation, some 35 mya) of France may have actually been a curlew or some bird ancestral to both curlews and godwits (and possibly other Scolopacidae), or even a rail, being placed in the monotypic genus Montirallus by some (Olson, 1985). Certainly, curlews and godwits are rather ancient and in some respects primitive lineages of scolopacids, further complicating the assignment of such possibly basal forms. In a 2001 study comparing the ratios cerebrum to brain volumes in various dinosaur species, Hans C. E. Larsson found that more derived dinosaurs generally had proportionally more voluminous cerebrum. Limosa gypsorum, then regarded as a Numenius species, was a discrepancy in this general trend. L. gypsorum was only 63% of the way between a typical reptilian ratio and that of modern birds. However, this may be explainable if the endocast was distorted, as it had been previously depicted in the past by Deschaseaux, who is described by Larsson as calling the endocast \\"slightly anteroposteriorly sheared and laterally compressed.\\" References Sources *Larsson, H.

Released under the GNU General Public License, gtk-gnutella is free software.  History  Initially gtk-gnutella was written to look like the original Nullsoft Gnutella client. The original author Yann Grossel stopped working on the client in early 2001. After a while Raphael Manfredi took over as the main software architect, and the client has been in active development ever since. Versions released after July 2002 do not look like the original Nullsoft client.  Features  gtk-gnutella is programmed in C with an emphasis on efficiency and portability without being minimalistic but rather head-on with most of the modern features of the gnutella network. Therefore, it requires fewer resources (such as CPU and/or RAM) than the major gnutella clients. It can also be used as headless gnutella client not requiring GTK+ at all. gtk-gnutella has a filtering engine that can reduce the amount of spam and other irrelevant results. gtk-gnutella supports a large range of the features of modern gnutella clients. gtk-gnutella was the first gnutella client to support IPv6 and encryption using TLS. It can handle and export magnet links. It has strong internationalization features, supporting English, German, Greek, French, Hungarian, Spanish, Japanese, Norwegian, Dutch and Chinese. gtk-gnutella also has support to prevent spamming and other hostile peer activity. Several software distributions provide pre-compiled packages, but they are usually outdated as many distributions version freeze old stable releases. The gnutella network benefits from running the latest version obtainable as peer and hostile IP address lists change rapidly, making building the latest SVN snapshot the best option. There are also pre-compiled packages for many Linux distributions available online. Persons concerned about security might wish to compile their own. The gtk-gnutella sources use dist as build and configuration system instead of Autoconf. Most users are only familiar with the configure scripts generated by the latter. Another hazard for novices is configuring NAT devices to enable full network connectivity for gtk-gnutella. gtk-gnutella, like any gnutella client, is still usable behind a firewall or a router, but with some reduced functionality, if it cannot receive incoming TCP connections or UDP packets. In an attempt to mitigate the issue for newcomers, gtk-gnutalla implements the UPnP and NAT-PMP client protocols. gtk-gnutella supports features for downloading larger files (videos, programs, and disk images). Version 0.96.4 supports Tiger tree hash serving and versions after 0.96.5 support tiger tree hashes for uploads and downloads. Tiger tree hashing and other gtk-gnutella features make file transfers as efficient as BitTorrent. Specifically, gtk- gnutella supports partial file sharing, remote queueing and files larger than 4 GiB. Overlap checking was the only mechanism to guard against bad data prior to versions 0.96.4. Overlap checking does not guard against malicious corruption like Tiger tree hashing does. Version 0.96.6 introduced preliminary support for a Kademlia DHT, which was completed in version 0.96.7. The DHT is replacing search by SHA-1, when locating alternate sources for a known file or looking for push-proxies. In version 0.96.7, the DHT is enabled by default. LimeWire first developed the DHT and named it Mojito DHT. Version 0.96.9 introduced full native support for UPnP and NAT-PMP, making the usage behind a compatible router much easier since there is no longer any need to manually forward ports on the firewall. In this version the code was also ported to Microsoft Windows however the Windows port is still considered beta due to lack of wide testing so far. Version 0.96.9 also introduced important DHT protection against Sybil attacks, using algorithms based on statistical properties. Version 0.97 was a major release, introducing client-side support for HTTP pipelining, \\"What's New?\\" queries, MIME type query filtering, GUESS support (Gnutella UDP Extension for Scalable Searches) and partial file querying. Although many Gnutella vendors already supported server-side GUESS, gtk-gnutella introduced the client-side as well, also enhancing the original specifications of the protocol to make it truly usable. Version 0.98.2 employs a minor patch to correct malloc memory allocations and multiple threads issues, mainly on Ubuntu 11.10 operating systems. This 2011 gtk-gnutella version was also dedicated to the memory of Dennis Ritchie, 1941-2011. Version 0.98.4 added RUDP (reliable UDP) and improved partial file transfers. Version 1.1 is a major release which added G2 support: gtk-gnutella will now connect to the G2 network in leaf mode. This allows searches from G2 nodes and lets local queries be propagated to the G2 network as well. File exchanges with G2 hosts are fully inter-operable and are permitted without restriction.  Popularity  gtk-gnutella does not rank as one of the most popular clients on GnutellaNet crawls. gtk-gnutella developers' proposals have been incorporated into many gnutella clients. In 2011, gtk-gnutella vendor extensions are the third most prolific on the GDF (Gnutella Developer Forum), following Limewire and Bearshare.Gnutella vendor extensionsGnutella working proposals Salon listed gtk-gnutella as one of the five most popular gnutella applications in 2002.Salon lists gtk-gnutella as one of the top five gnutella clients. (2002) XoloX and Toadnode, also in the list, are no longer actively developed.

J. Clifford, 1st Bt, as Black Rod. Black Rod (officially known as the Lady Usher of the Black Rod or, if male, the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod) is an official in the parliaments of several Commonwealth countries. The position originates in the House of Lords of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The position is similar to one known as a serjeant-at-arms in other bodies. In the United Kingdom, Black Rod is principally responsible for controlling access to and maintaining order within the House of Lords and its precincts, as well as for ceremonial events within those precincts. Since early 2018, the post has been held for the first time by a woman, Sarah Clarke. Origin The office was created in 1350 by royal letters patent, though the current title dates from 1522. The position was adopted by other members of the Commonwealth when they adopted the British Westminster system. The title is derived from the staff of office, an ebony staff topped with a golden lion, which is the main symbol of the office's authority. A ceremonial rod or staff is a common type of symbol indicating the authority of the office-holder. Depictions of ancient authority figures in many cultures include such a rod (alternatively called a sceptre). Another early example was the fasces (literally a bound bundle of rods) carried by guards (\\"lictors\\") who accompanied certain high-level officials in the Roman Republic and later Empire. United Kingdom =Appointment= Black Rod is formally appointed by the Crown based on a recruitment search performed by the Clerk of the Parliaments, who is the employer of all House of Lords officials. Prior to 2002, the office rotated among retired senior officers from the Royal Navy, the British Army and the Royal Air Force. It is now advertised openly. Black Rod is an officer of the English Order of the Garter, and is usually appointed Knight Bachelor if not already knighted. His or her deputy is the Yeoman Usher of the Black Rod. =Official duties= Black Rod is principally responsible for controlling access to and maintaining order within the House of Lords and its precincts, as well as for ceremonial events within those precincts. Previous responsibilities for security, and the buildings and services of the Palace of Westminster, have been passed, respectively, to the Parliamentary Security Director (as of the post's creation in January 2016) and Lords Director of Facilities (as of that post's creation and the retirement of the then-Black Rod in May 2009). Black Rod's official duties also include responsibility as the usher and doorkeeper at meetings of the Most Noble Order of the Garter; the personal attendant of the Sovereign in the Lords; as secretary to the Lord Great Chamberlain and as the Serjeant-at-Arms and Keeper of the Doors of the House, in charge of the admission of strangers to the House of Lords. Either Black Rod or her deputy, the Yeoman Usher, is required to be present when the House of Lords, the upper house of Parliament, is in session, and plays a role in the introduction of all new Lords Temporal in the House (but not of bishops as new Lords Spiritual). Black Rod also arrests any Lord guilty of breach of privilege or other Parliamentary offence, such as contempt or disorder, or the disturbance of the House's proceedings. Her equivalent in the House of Commons is the Serjeant at Arms. Former Black Rod, David Leakey, said that 30% of his work as Black Rod was within or for the House of Commons. Black Rod, along with her deputy, is responsible for organising ceremonial events within the Palace of Westminster, providing leadership in guiding the significant logistics of running such events. =Ceremonial duties= Mace Black Rod is in theory responsible for carrying the Mace into and out of the chamber for the Speaker of the House of Lords (formerly the Lord Chancellor, now the Lord Speaker), though this role is delegated to the Yeoman Usher and Deputy Serjeant-at-Arms, or on judicial occasions, to the Lord Speaker's deputy, the Assistant Serjeant-at-Arms. The mace was introduced in 1876. State Opening of Parliament Black Rod is best known for their part in the ceremonies surrounding the State Opening of Parliament and the Speech from the throne. They summon the Commons to attend the speech and lead them to the Lords. As part of the ritual, the doors to the chamber of the House of Commons are slammed in the approaching Black Rod's face. This is to symbolise the Commons' independence of the Sovereign. Black Rod then strikes the door three times with the staff, and is then admitted and issues the summons of the monarch to attend. From 1980 until October 2019, Dennis Skinner, the former Labour MP from Bolsover, made a quip after Black Rod's summons. This ritual also happens whenever the Lords have a commission to be read and Black Rod summons MPs to hear it. For example, on Tuesday 17 December 2019 this ritual happened twice. This ritual is derived from the attempt by King Charles I to arrest Five Members in 1642, in what was seen as a breach of the constitution. This and prior actions of the King led to the Civil War. After that incident, the House of Commons has maintained its right to question the right of the monarch's representative to enter their chamber, although they cannot bar them from entering with lawful authority. =List of Black Rods in England, Great Britain and the UK from 1361= This list is derived from one published by the Parliamentary Archives in 2011, with alterations from later research. * c.1361‚Äì1387: Walter Whitehorse * 1387‚Äì1399: John Cray * 1399‚Äì1410: Thomas Sy * 1410‚Äì1413: John Sheffield * 1413‚Äì1415: John Athelbrigg * 1415‚Äì1418: William Hargroave * 1418‚Äì1423: John Clifford * 1423‚Äì1428: John Carsons * 1428‚Äì1459: William Pope * 1438‚Äì1459: Robert Manfield (joint) * 1459‚Äì1461: John Penycok * 1461‚Äì1471: Vacant ? * 1471‚Äì1485: William Evington * 1483‚Äì1485: Edward Hardgill (joint) * 1485‚Äì1489: Robert Marleton * 1489‚Äì1513: Ralph Assheton * 1495‚Äì30 December 1511: Hugh Denys (jointly with Assheton until Denys's death) * 1513‚Äì1526: Sir William Compton * 1526‚Äì1536: Henry Norreys * 1536‚Äì1543: Anthony Knyvett * 1543‚Äì1554: Sir Philip Hoby * 1554‚Äì1565: John Norreys * 1554‚Äì1591: Sir William Norreys (joint) * 1591‚Äì1593: Anthony Wingfield * 1593‚Äì1598: Simon Bowyer * 1598‚Äì1620: Richard Coningsby * 1605‚Äì1620: George Pollard (joint) * 1620‚Äì1642: James Maxwell * 1642‚Äì1649: Alexander Thayne (as recognised by Parliament); jointly with James Maxwell until c. 1646.

It came into being after a split in the Workers' Party, and after seven years in existence it was incorporated into the Irish Labour Party in 1999. The Democratic Left served in a three-party coalition government with Fine Gael and the Labour Party from December 1994 to June 1997. Origins Democratic Left was formed after a split in the Workers' Party, which in turn had its origins in the 1970 split in Sinn F√©in. Although never formally styled as a communist party, the Workers' Party had an internal organisation based on democratic centralism, strong links with the Soviet Union, and campaigned for socialist policies. The party gained support during the 1980s - a decade of cutbacks and hardship in Ireland - winning 7 TDs in the 1989 general election and 24 councillors in the 1991 local elections. However between 1989 and 1992 the Workers' Party was beset by a number of problems. The collapse of communism in eastern Europe had put many Soviet-aligned parties on the defensive and had caused a number of them to reconsider their core ideological beliefs. A faction led by Proinsias De RossaProinsias De Rossa, 'The case for a new departure Making Sense March‚ÄìApril 1992 wanted to move the party towards an acceptance of free-market economics, viewing the party's Marxist stance as an obstacle to further electoral success. The party was languishing in opinion polls and there was increasing tension between the party's elected representatives such as De Rossa, Pat Rabbitte and Eamon Gilmore and another grouping involving activists and organisers on the party's Central Executive Committee, led by Sean Garland. Finally the broadcast of a BBC Spotlight programme in June 1991 had raised questions on the party's links to the Official IRA.BBC Spotlight programme, 'Sticking to their guns', June 1991 The Official IRA had been on ceasefire since 1972 but was frequently accused of being involved in fund-raising robberies, money-laundering and other forms of criminality.Three more Northern Ireland terrorist groups lay down their arms The Times The secret world of SFWP. Magill magazine 1982 On 15 February 1992, a special conference was held in D√∫n Laoghaire to reconstitute the party. Over the preceding two weeks there were clashes at a number of party meetings between supporters of De Rossa and Garland. A motion proposed by De Rossa and general secretary Des Geraghty sought to stand down the existing membership, elect an 11-member provisional executive council and make several other significant changes in party structures. Initially supporters believed that the motion would pass but it was defeated by 9 votes. After the announcement of the results, De Rossa told the delegates \\"You have your decision. I honestly believe it is a bad decision, but you have made it,\\". Both sides accused each other \\"packing votes\\". Formation After the conference it was clear a split was inevitable. At an Ard Chomhairle meeting held on 22 February in Wynns Hotel in Dublin City, six of the party's TDs resigned from the party along with more than half of the Ard Chomhairle. The members who left included the party leader Proinsias De Rossa and five more of the party's seven members of D√°il √âireann (Pat Rabbitte, Eamon Gilmore, Eric Byrne, Pat McCartan and Joe Sherlock). The party's President for most of the previous 30 years, Tom√°s Mac Giolla refused to join the breakaway and remained with the Workers' Party although he had reluctantlyPatterns of Betrayal: the flight from Socialism, Workers Party pamphlet, Repsol Ltd, Dublin, May 1992 supported the constitutional amendments and had considered departing the party after the conference. The new party was provisionally named New Agenda with De Rossa becoming leader of the new party. There was speculation that the Labour TD Emmet Stagg would join the new grouping. Stagg, who was on the left of the Labour Party, had resigned the party whip before the Workers' Party split and it was indicated that he might join the new group.The Irish Times, 22 February 1992 However Stagg eventually opted not to join. The party was hampered by the fact that it immediately lost D√°il privileges such as speaking rights, the ability to table priority questions and the allocation of private members time it had enjoyed as the Workers' Party as it did not meet the minimum requirement of 7 TDs. The new party did not qualify for the party leader's allowance scheme depriving it of a vital source of funding. The party was renamed Democratic Left at its founding conference held on 28 March 1992. The new party was defined as a: Electoral history and participation in government The party's first contest was the 1992 UK general election, in which it stood in two constituencies in Northern Ireland and polled 2,133 votes. The election was fought under the \\"New Agenda\\" label. In the North the party contested elections in 1996 for the Northern Ireland Forum but with less than 1% of the vote they failed to have any members elected. The party inherited two councillors at its foundation: Seamus Lynch lost his Belfast City Council seat in 1993, Gerry Cullen had been elected for the Workers' Party in 1989 in Dungannon Town and was re-elected in 1993 and 1997 local elections.Northern Ireland and the Democratic Left Party, 1989‚Äì1999 ‚Äì Ciaran McClean, New Hibernia Review (2003) In the 1992 Irish general election the party lost two of its six D√°il seats (Eric Byrne narrowly following a week of counting and recounting, Pat McCartan and Joe Sherlock losing their seats, and Liz McManus winning a seat in Wicklow), gaining 2.8% of the vote compared to 5% for the pre-split Workers' Party in the preceding general election. Joe Sherlock was elected on the Labour Panel to Seanad √âireann as part of an election pact with their politically polar opposites Progressive Democrats.Chapter 10 The Subterranean Election of the Seanad Michael Gallagher and Liam Weeks UCC The party subsequently won two seats in by-elections, Eric Byrne regaining his seat in Dublin South CentralDublin South Central 9 June 1994 (Electionsireland.org) and Kathleen LynchCork North Central by-election result 10 November 1994 (Electionsireland.org) in Cork North Central. After the collapse of the Fianna F√°il-Labour Party coalition government in 1994, Democratic Left joined the new coalition government with Fine Gael and the Labour Party. Proinsias De Rossa served as Minister for Social Welfare, initiating Ireland's first national anti-poverty strategy. Merger with Labour In the 1997 general election Democratic Left lost two of its six seats, both of its by-election victors being unseated. The party won 2.5% of the vote. The party also was in significant financial debt because of a lack of access to public funds, due to its size. Between 1998 and 1999 the party entered discussions with the Labour Party which culminated in the parties' merger in 1999, keeping the name of the larger partner but excluding members in Northern Ireland from organising.Steven King on Thursday, Steven King, The Belfast Telegraph, 17 December 1998 This left Gerry Cullen, their councillor in Dungannon Borough Council, in a state of limbo, representing a party for whom he could no longer seek election. The launch of the merged party was in the Pillar Room of the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin on 24 January 1999. Labour Party leader Ruairi Quinn remained leader of the unified party, while De Rossa took up the largely titular position of party president. Only 10% of Democratic Left delegates at the special conference had voted against the merger. In 1999 De Rossa successfully contested the European Parliament election in Dublin. He held his D√°il seat until he stood down at the 2002 general election. He held his European Parliament seat in the 2004 election and 2009 election In 2002, the former Democratic Left TDs Pat Rabbitte and Liz McManus were elected as Labour Party leader and deputy leader respectively. When Rabbite stepped down as Labour leader after the 2007 general election, Gilmore was elected unopposed as his successor.

In his career, he became the co-inventor of the modern electric transformer,Encyclop√¶dia Britannica the tension regulator, the AC watt-hour meter.motor capacitor for the single-phase (AC) electric motor, the turbo generator, and the high- efficiency turbo generator. Bl√°thy's career as an inventor began during his time at the Ganz Works in 1883. There, he conducted experiments for creating a transformer. The name \\"transformer\\" was created by Bl√°thy. In 1885 the ZBD model alternating-current transformer was invented by three Hungarian engineers: Ott√≥ Bl√°thy, Miksa D√©ri and K√°roly Zipernowsky. (ZBD comes from the initials of their names). In the autumn of 1889 he patented the AC watt-meter. Student paper read on 24 January 1896 at the Students' Meeting.  Early life  He attended schools in Tata and Vienna, where he obtained diploma of machinery in 1882. Between 1881 and 1883 he worked at the machinery workshop of the Hungarian Railways (MAV). Attracted by the successes of K√°roly Zipernowsky, he joined his team on 1 July 1883. He admitted he had learnt nothing about electrotechnics in university, so he started to learn about the theory himself. Using the Maxwell equations he invented a practical approach of sizing magnetic coils. Kapp and Hopkinson (for whom Hopkinson's law is named) only published their findings later in 1886 and 1887, respectively.  Professional life  His practical calculation method was crucial in building the first practical transformer. Based on his findings, he rebuilt his machines in 1883 and obtained better efficiency with the same weight. He was the first to investigate the heat dissipation problems of electric motors, and at that time the connection between current density and heat was determined. At the Turin Italian National Exhibition in 1884, he saw Gaulard and Gibbs's \\"secondary generator\\"' (i.e. AC transformer) system, and he decided to improve it. Including a closed-loop magnetic field, based on the findings of Faraday, he conducted experiments with Miksa D√©ri in the summer of 1884 at the Ganz factory. Based on these experiments, they invented the transformer in 1885, which was unveiled at the Budapest National Exhibition in 1885. Based on the opinions of Galileo Ferraris, the Italian government ordered a power transformer for Rome, which was installed in October 1886. Later, they designed a power plant for Tivoli, built by Ganz, with six water turbines and 5000 V, which were worked in parallel with the old steam engine generators. This was the first time in history two high-voltage power plants were connected. His other invention, the electricity meter, was first introduced to the market in 1889. He tried to improve it and decrease its weight.  Chess works  Besides his scientific work, Bl√°thy is well known as an author of chess problems. He specialized in the field of very long moremovers, also known as longmovers. (see grotesque (chess) for one of his problems).

The missing link of a full Voltage sensitive - voltage intensive (VSVI) system was the reliable AC Constant Voltage generator. Therefore, the invention of the constant voltage generator at the Ganz Works had crucial role in the beginnings of the industrial scale AC power generating, because only these type of generators can produce a stated output voltage, regardless of the value of the actual load.

The ZBD system is based on a closed- iron ring core with an arbitrary diameter and a coil around the core, which conducts AC current. Their system converted higher voltage suitable for energy transmission to lower \\"service\\"-level voltage (step-down transformer). Nikola Tesla then proposed the use of step-up transformers, which would output higher voltage current than they received.

Lapageria rosea is the national flower of Chile. It grows in forests in the southern part of Chile, being part of the Valdivian temperate rain forests flora. Botany Lapageria rosea is related to Philesia magellanica (syn. P. buxifolia), another plant from the Valdivian flora, having similar flowers, but shrubby rather than climbing. √óPhilageria veitchii is a hybrid between L. rosea and P. magellanica. It is more similar in appearance to the former. =Growth habit= Lapageria rosea is an evergreen climbing plant reaching over 10 m high among shrubs and trees. The leaves are arranged alternately and are evergreen, leathery, lanceolate and feature three to seven prominent parallel veins. The vines twine counterclockwise in the Southern hemisphere and clockwise when grown in the Northern hemisphere (likely due to the Sun). The flowers have six thick, waxy tepals which are red, spotted with white. They are most frequently produced in late summer and fall, although they may be produced at other times. The fruit is an elongated berry with a tough skin containing numerous small seeds about the size of a tomato seed, which are covered in an edible fleshy aril. In the wild the plant is pollinated by hummingbirds. Pollen is distributed by birds, insects and other animals. Insect pollinators include: Bombus dahlbomii (native species to southern South America) and Bombus terrestris and Bombus ruderatus (both of which are not native to southern South America, and, instead, invasive).Morales, C. L., et al. (2004). \\"Potential displacement of the native bumblebee Bombus dahlbomii by the invasive Bombus ruderatus in NW Patagonia, Argentina\\", pp. 70-76 in Proceedings of the 8th IBRA International Conference on Tropical Bees and VI Encontro sobre Abelhas, Ribeir√£o Preto, Brasil, September 6‚Äì10, 2004. Historical usage In the past its fruit was sold in markets, but the plant has now become rare through over-collection and forest clearance. The roots were once collected and used as a substitute for sarsaparilla. In 1977 the plant was given legal protection in Chile. Etymology Lapageria is named for Marie Jos√©phine Rose Tascher de la Pagerie (1763-1814), also known as Napoleon's Empress Josephine, who was a keen collector of plants for her garden at Ch√¢teau de Malmaison.Gledhill, David (2008). \\"The Names of Plants\\". Cambridge University Press. (hardback), (paperback). pp 230, 334 Rosea means 'flushed rose' or 'flushed pink'. The name of the fruit in Mapudungun is actually kopiw (derived from kop√ºn, \\"to be upside down\\"), which is the etymon of Spanish copihue; the Mapuche call the plant kolkopiw (colcopihue in Spanish, which may also refer to the whole plant). The flower is called kodk√ºlla in the indigenous language. Cultivation The plant was introduced to Europe by William Lobb during his plant collecting expedition to the Valdivian temperate rain forests in 1845‚Äì1848 and was growing at Kew in 1847. In cultivation the plant requires a shaded, sheltered position with acid or neutral soil. It is hardy down to , so in the UK can be grown outside in mild or coastal areas. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. =Cultivars= There are numerous named garden cultivars, mostly developed at one nursery in Chile, with flower colour varying from deep red through pink to pure white (L. rosea 'Albiflora'), and some with variegated flowers. In the United States, UC Botanical Garden at the University of California at Berkeley has one of the largest collections of the Lapageria genus with around 24 named and unnamed cultivars in its collection. This collection was started by T Harper Goodspeed, botany professor at UCB and alternately curator or director of the gardens from 1919‚Äì1957. The University established a relationship with El Vergel Farm, a Methodist mission and agricultural school in Angol, Chile which housed the largest collection of named cultivars and wild lapagerias in the world.http://www.PacificHorticulture.com/articles/ilapageria-roseai =Propagation= To obtain fruit in cultivation it is generally necessary to pollinate by hand if there are not native hummingbirds. Chilean bellflower can be propagated from cuttings, layering and fresh seeds., Lapageria rosea,The Lovely Plants Some cultivars are self-fruitful, but better pollination is achieved with differing parents. Germination is best with fresh moist seed; dried seeds take special treatment and have a much poorer germination rate. Propagation of cultivars is by cuttings (usually rooted under mist), layering, or division. Seedlings take from three to ten years to flower. Cuttings usually flower more quickly.

The district surrounds, but does not include the city of Coburg.  History  The history of the district is largely influenced by the city of Coburg. From 1826 to 1918, the region was part of the small duchy of Saxe- Coburg-Gotha (see Thuringia). In a referendum from 1919, the Coburg portion of this state decided to join Bavaria (united in 1920). The present district is identical to that portion, but excludes the city of Coburg and the exclave of K√∂nigsberg, which is part of Ha√überge district.

Career McDowell was born in Rossville, Tennessee. His parents were farmers, who both died while Fred was in his youth. He took up the guitar at the age of 14 and was soon playing for tips at dances around Rossville. Seeking a change from plowing fields, he moved to Memphis in 1926, where he worked in the Buck-Eye feed mill, which processed cotton into oil and other products.Delta Blues back sleeve Arhoolie F1021 In 1928, he moved to Mississippi to pick cotton. He finally settled in Como, Mississippi, in 1940 or 1941 (or maybe the late 1950s), where he worked as a full-time farmer for many years while continuing to play music on weekends at dances and picnics. After decades of playing for small local gatherings, McDowell was recorded in 1959 by roving folklore musicologist Alan Lomax and Shirley Collins on their Southern Journey field-recording trip.Collins, Shirley (2004). America over the Water. S.A.F. pp. 134‚Äì136. . With interest in blues and folk music rising in the United States at the time, McDowell's field recordings for Lomax caught the attention of blues aficionados and record producers, and within a couple of years, he had finally become a professional musician and recording artist in his own right. His LPs proved quite popular, and he performed at festivals and clubs all over the world. McDowell continued to perform blues in the north Mississippi style much as he had for decades, sometimes on electric guitar rather than acoustic guitar. He was particularly renowned for his mastery of slide guitar, a style he said he first learned using a pocketknife for a slide and later a polished beef rib bone. He ultimately settled on the clearer sound he got from a glass slide, which he wore on his ring finger. While he famously declared, \\"I do not play no rock and roll,\\" he was not averse to associating with younger rock musicians. He coached Bonnie Raitt on slide guitar technique and was reportedly flattered by The Rolling Stones' rather straightforward version of his \\"You Gotta Move\\" on their 1971 album Sticky Fingers. In 1965 he toured Europe with the American Folk Blues Festival, together with Big Mama Thornton, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy, Roosevelt Sykes and others. McDowell's 1969 album I Do Not Play No Rock 'n' Roll, recorded in Jackson, Mississippi, and released by Malaco Records, was his first featuring electric guitar. It contains parts of an interview in which he discusses the origins of the blues and the nature of love. His live album Live at the Mayfair Hotel (1995) was from a concert he gave in 1969. Tracks included versions of Bukka White's \\"Shake 'Em On Down,\\" Willie Dixon's \\"My Babe,\\" Mance Lipscomb's \\"Evil Hearted Woman,\\" plus McDowell's self-penned \\"Kokomo Blues.\\" AllMusic noted that the album \\"may be the best single CD in McDowell's output, and certainly his best concert release\\". McDowell's final album, Live in New York (Oblivion Records), was a concert performance from November 1971 at the Village Gaslight (also known as The Gaslight Cafe), in Greenwich Village, New York. McDowell died of cancer in 1972, aged 66, and was buried at Hammond Hill Baptist Church, between Como and Senatobia, Mississippi. On August 6, 1993, a memorial was placed on his grave by the Mount Zion Memorial Fund. The ceremony was presided over by the blues promoter Dick Waterman, and the memorial with McDowell's portrait on it was paid for by Bonnie Raitt. The memorial stone was a replacement for an inaccurate (McDowell's name was misspelled) and damaged marker. The original stone was subsequently donated by McDowell's family to the Delta Blues Museum, in Clarksdale, Mississippi. McDowell was a Freemason and was associated with Prince Hall Freemasonry; he was buried in Masonic regalia. Bibliography * Ferris, William (1988). Blues from the Delta. Rev. ed.

PHA actually consists of two closely related proteins, called leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) and PHA-E. The letters E and L indicate these proteins agglutinate erythrocytes (red blood cells) and leukocytes (white blood cells) respectively. Phytohaemagglutinin has carbohydrate-binding specificity for a complex oligosaccharide containing galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, and mannose. It is found in the highest concentrations in uncooked red kidney beans and white kidney beans (also known as cannellini), and it is also found in lower quantities in many other types of green beans and other common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), as well as broad beans (Vicia faba) such as fava beans. It has a number of physiological effects and is used in medical research. In high doses, it is a toxin. The lectin has a number of effects on cell metabolism; it induces mitosis, and affects the cell membrane in regard to transport and permeability to proteins. It agglutinates most mammalian red blood cell types. As a toxin, it can cause poisoning in monogastric animals, such as humans, through the consumption of raw or improperly prepared kidney beans. Measured in haemagglutinating units (hau), a raw red kidney bean may contain up to 70,000 hau. This can be reduced to safe levels by correct cooking by boiling unsoaked beans for at least 30 minutes, presoaked beans for 15 minutes, 2 hours at , or 45 minutes pressure cooked at 15 psi. Insufficient cooking, such as in a slow cooker at 75 ¬∞C/ 167 ¬∞F, may not completely destroy the toxins. Beans also contain alpha amylase inhibitor, but not in sufficient quantities to affect the digestion of starch after consumption of beans. Poisoning can be induced from as few as five raw beans, and symptoms occur within three hours, beginning with nausea, then vomiting, which can be severe and sustained (profuse), followed by diarrhea. Recovery occurs within four or five hours of onset, usually without the need for any medical intervention. In medicine these proteins are useful and are used as a mitogen to trigger T-lymphocyte cell division and to activate latent HIV-1 from human peripheral lymphocytes. In neuroscience, anterograde tracing is a research method that uses the protein product phytohaemagglutinin PHA-L as a molecular tracer that can be taken up by the cell and transported across the synapse into the next cell thereby tracing the path of axonal projections and relative connections that nerve impulses travel beginning with the source located at the perikaryon (cell body or soma) and through the presynaptic part located on neuron's efferent axon all the way to the point of termination at the efferent synapse which then provides input to another neuron. Lymphocytes cultured with phytohaemagglutinin can be used for karyotype analysis. Stimulation of peripheral blood lymphocytes by phytohaemagglutinin presents a classic model of transition of cells from the quiescent G0 phase of the cell cycle into G1-, and subsequently progression through S-, G2- and M- phases of the cycle.  History  PHA was discovered by Peter Nowell in the 1960s.

Only one species now exists, and it is rare and little known. This bird is sometimes separated in the genus Aechmorhynchus, restricting the genus to the extinct southern forms. List of species * Tuamotu sandpiper, P. parvirostris * ‚Ä† Tahiti sandpiper, P. leucoptera * ‚Ä† Moorea sandpiper, P. ellisi * ‚Ä† Kiritimati sandpiper, P. cancellata Description The Tuamotu sandpiper, P. parvirostris, is a unique short- billed all-brown wader previously found over a large area of the Pacific, but now confined to a few islands in the Tuamotu archipelago and still declining. Its decline appears to be due to human habitation encroachment and introduced mammals. It feeds on insects, but takes some vegetable material from its coastal haunts. It nests on the ground, and has a soft piping call. The extinct Tahiti sandpiper, P. leucoptera of Tahiti was similar in size and shape to P. cancellata. It had brown upperparts, reddish underparts, a white wingbar, and some white on the face and throat. It became extinct in the 19th century, and little is known of it. There was a similar bird on Moorea which differed in some minor details from P. leucoptera, notably the larger extent of white in the wing, and has been described as Moorea sandpiper (P. ellisi). However, although two species are generally listed, the question whether they actually did constitute separate species is probably unresolvable as only a single specimen of it exists today, apart from some contemporary paintings. From Mangaia in the Cook Islands, Ua Huka in the Marquesas, and the remote South Pacific Henderson Island (Wragg 1995), subfossil remains of Prosobonia have been recovered but not yet named. The first of these was almost certainly more closely related to the Tahiti and Moorea populations than to the Tuamotu sandpiper, but the exact nature of their relationship is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon. It disappeared in the early-mid 1st millennium AD, probably not long after 300 AD. The Ua Huka and Henderson forms can be assumed to have been closer to the living species. The latter, a distinct species with long legs and short wings (Wragg & Weisler 1994), became extinct only about 1000 years after the Mangaia form, some time after 1200.

Two specimens were collected by Georg Forster and William Anderson between September 30 and October 11, 1777, during Captain Cook's third voyage, but both have since disappeared and the bird became extinct in the nineteenth century. The only hint at its former existence are Anderson's notes and the descriptions based on them, a painting by William Ellis and a plate by J. Webber which apparently depicts the other specimen. These show a somewhat lighter brown bird than the Tahiti specimen, with no white spot behind the eye, a more conspicuous light rusty eye-ring, two white wing-bars and rusty secondary and primary coverts; one of Latham's specimens had yellow legs and feet. The exact relationships between the Moorea bird and the Tahiti sandpiper are still not fully resolved. The bird was found \\"close to small brooks\\" and it was still at least moderately common around 1776 - 1779 during Cook's last voyage.

Such flags display the United Kingdom Union Flag in the canton (the upper corner next to the staff), with either a red, white or blue field, dependent on whether the vessel is civilian, naval, or in a special category. These are known as the red, white, and blue ensigns respectively. Outside the nautical sphere, ensigns are used to designate many other military units, government departments and administrative divisions. These flags are modelled on the red, white, and blue naval ensigns, but may use different colours for the field, and be defaced by the addition of a badge or symbol, for example the sky blue with concentric red, white and blue circles of the Royal Air Force ensign. The Union Flag (also known as the Union Jack) should be flown as a jack by Royal Navy ships only when moored, at anchor, while underway and dressed with masthead ensigns, or if the Monarch or an Admiral of the Fleet is on board. The Union Flag may also signal that a court martial is in progress. The use of the Union Flag as an ensign on a civilian craft is still illegal, ever since Charles I ordered it be restricted to His Majesty's ships \\"upon pain of Our high displeasure\\" in the 17th century, mainly due to its unauthorised use by merchant mariners to avoid paying harbour duties by passing themselves off as Royal vessels. Modern usage British ensigns currently in use can be classified into five categories, in descending order of exclusivity: * the White Ensign * the Blue Ensign * the Blue Ensign defaced * the Red Ensign * the Red Ensign defaced The traditional order of seniority was red, white and blue, with the red as the senior ensign. White Today's white ensign, as used by Royal Navy ships, incorporates the St George's Cross (St George's Ensign). British yachts owned by members of the Royal Yacht Squadron are authorised to apply for a permit to wear this ensign. Defaced white ensigns include that of the British Antarctic Territory. Since the reorganisation of the Royal Navy in 1864, use of the White Ensign (a red St George's Cross on a white field with the Union Flag in the canton) has been restricted to ships, boats, submarines and on-shore establishments of the Royal Navy. The Royal Yacht Squadron also fly the white ensign by special dispensation. Blue The Blue Ensign (dark blue field with the Union Flag in the canton) undefaced is worn by masters of vessels in possession of a warrant issued by the Director of Naval Reserves, and by the members of certain yacht clubs. Such warrants are issued to officers in the active or retired lists of the Royal Naval Reserve and the maritime reserve forces of other Commonwealth realms and territories. The master must be of the rank of lieutenant RN or above, and fishing vessels must be crewed by at least four other Royal Naval reservists or pensioners. The Ensign of the Sea Cadet Corps is a blue ensign defaced by the SCC badge. Under the terms of a Memorandum of Understanding with the Ministry of Defence, officers of the Sea Cadet Corps hold their ranks as (SCC) RNR on a 'nominal honorific' basis, and are included on the Navy List as a courtesy (though they are not commissioned, but 'appointed' within the Corps). =Defaced= British government departments use a variety of blue ensigns defaced in the fly with the department badge, and colonial governments use blue ensigns defaced with the colonial badge. Other defaced ensigns were used by vessels of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, the Humber Conservancy, Custom House, the Board of Trade, Lloyd's of London, the Post Office, submarine cable laying ships, and other departments including War Office Ordnance. The flag of Australia and those of its states as well as the flag of New Zealand are defaced blue ensigns. Several yacht clubs are also entitled to fly blue ensigns defaced by their club badge. Red The Red Ensign (red field with the Union Flag in the canton) defaced by a badge is flown by Trinity House and various organisations and yacht clubs. Merchant ships and private vessels registered in British territories and dependencies, and in several Commonwealth realms, fly the Red Ensign defaced by the badge of their territory. The Red Ensign undefaced is for the use of all other British merchant navy ships and private craft. The Red Ensign is the correct flag to be worn as courtesy flag by foreign private vessels in United Kingdom waters. Merchant vessels from British overseas territories and Crown dependencies are entitled to red ensigns defaced with the badge of their territory. Other ensigns The flag of the British East India Company, like the Cambridge or Grand Union Flag of the American colonies, had a red and white striped field. There were similar red-and-white and green-and-white striped ensigns in the English Navy in the 16th century. Similarly in flag plates from the 17th and 18th centuries there are representations of the Guinea Jack of the Royal Africa Company in various forms; the jack consisted of St George's Cross within a double border of red and white chequers. The flag of Hawaii is a British ensign with a background of white, red and blue stripes. Also in existence is a Royal Air Force (RAF) ensign and a civil air ensign, both of which have a sky-blue field, with the Union Flag in the canton. The RAF Ensign is defaced with the red-white-blue RAF roundel, while the field of the civil air ensign is charged with a large dark-blue cross fimbriated white. During World War II, the Belgian section of the RAF used a variant of RAF Ensign defaced with the black-yellow-red roundel. The flag of Tuvalu and that of Fiji are also defaced sky blue ensigns. The white ensign of the commissioner of the Northern Lighthouse Board is unique in that it remains the only example of a pre-1801 Union Flag in official use today. This flag is flown only from vessels with commissioners aboard. There are two \\"yellow\\" ensigns in use in the South Pacific, both featuring the Southern Cross. The personal flag of the governor of Victoria, Australia, has been the flag of Victoria with a yellow instead of a dark blue background. The flag of Niue, a self-governing dependency of New Zealand, is also a yellow ensign. More unusually, it is the Union Flag canton rather than the fly which is defaced with a modified Southern Cross. There is some evidence of the existence of a Green Ensign in British Ireland, defaced with a gold Irish harp in the fly. It is not clear to what extent this unofficial ensign was ever in use by Irish merchant ships at the time. The flag of the British Antarctic Territory has a white field defaced with the territory's badge, while the British Indian Ocean Territory flag has a white and blue wavy-striped field, also defaced. Finally, there is one \\"orange\\" ensign, used by the Orange Order in Canada. This flag is an orange ensign defaced with a white shield, and a red maple leaf within it. = Cornish Ensign = Cornish Ensign The Cornish Ensign or St Piran's Ensign, is a Cornish flag defaced with the Union flag in the canton. This flag is used widely among Cornish mariners. Often flown by leisure craft and occasionally flown by Cornish merchant vessels. = Devon Ensign = Devon Ensign First flown in 2003 the Devon Regatta Ensign adds a Union flag into the canton of the Devon Flag ‚Äì the flag is described as for use at regattas, high days and holidays, weddings and burials at sea.http://imperialflags.blogspot.co.uk/2007/06/isle-of- man.htmlhttp://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gb-e-dev.html This flag can also be referred to as the St Petroc's Ensign, due to its link with the saint. This flag is widely used among Devonian mariners. Often flown by leisure craft. The Royal Hospital School The Royal Hospital School is the only independent school in the United Kingdom to have been continuously awarded the \\"Queens Banner\\" and its own distinctive school ensign. History Queen Elizabeth II flying the Union Jack at the jackstaff and also at the masthead to signify the royal presence. Prior to 1864, red, white, and blue were the colours of the three squadrons of the Royal Navy, which were created as a result of the reorganisation of the navy in 1652 by Admiral Robert Blake. Each squadron flew one of the three ensigns. In addition to the Admiral of the Fleet (who was Admiral of the Red), each squadron had its own admirals, vice admirals and rear admirals, e.g. Lord Nelson was Vice Admiral of the White at the time of his death. The red squadron tended to patrol the Caribbean and north Atlantic, the white the coasts of Britain, France and the Mediterranean, while the blue patrolled the south Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. The flags of the various former British colonies often have grounds of the same colour as their protective squadron. Hence Bermuda has a red ground and Australia and New Zealand blue. Canada's flag was a red ensign from founding until the adoption of the more familiar maple leaf flag in 1965. The flag of the United States also follows this pattern; early flags of the American Revolution were modified Red Ensigns. The Grand Union Flag added six white stripes to the Red Ensign; this flag was used during the fight for independence until the Union Flag in the canton was replaced by the stars in 1777. Reference was sometimes made to \\"the yellow squadron\\". This squadron did not actually exist but was a term used unofficially to describe those naval personnel who worked ashore or did not have a ship. Therefore, there was no 'Yellow ensign'.Promotion in the Flag Ranks in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars Canadian ensigns In 1868, the British Admiralty made the Canadian Blue Ensign the proper flag for ships of the Canadian government, and in 1892, the Admiralty approved the use of the Canadian Red Ensign by Canadian merchant ships. From about 1870, Canada unofficially used a Red Ensign with the arms of its provinces on one shield as its national flag (the Canadian Red Ensign). In 1924, an order-in-council made the flag official (for certain purposes) and replaced the provincial arms with the royal arms of Canada. The red ensign was replaced by the current red and white maple-leaf flag in 1965. In that same year, the provinces of Ontario and Manitoba adopted red ensigns defaced by their provincial arms as their provincial flags.

It typically involves a sound system playing electronic dance music from late at night until the time when the organisers decide to go home. A free party can be composed of just one system or of many and if the party becomes a festival, it becomes a teknival. The parties can be thought of as autonomous zones where all the people present create and enforce the rules. This typically means that drugs are readily available and noise levels are usually illegally high. The word free in this context is used both to describe the entry fee and the lack of restrictions and law enforcement. Motivations for organisers range from political protest to simply wanting to have fun. An example of free parties as political protest was their prominence during the M11 link road protest. At most parties no money is asked for entrance since the aim is not to make profit. However, at some (most often indoor) events it is requested at the door to make a donation to cover costs. Typically organisers make little profit or make a loss setting them up. The term free party is used more widely in Europe than in the US. In Canada and some parts of Europe they are also referred to as Freetekno parties. A free party might have once been described as a rave, and the origins of the two are similar. Since the birth of nightclubs in town centres in Europe the use of the word rave had largely fallen out of fashion, however in recent times it is increasingly being used again. The term squat party defines the free parties with secret indoor locations. The address is obtained on the day of the event personally from organizers as the buildings are squatted. The parties often last over 24 hours. History May 2005, UK Tek a large outdoor free party in Wales After the emergence of the Acid House parties in the late 1980s up to 4,000Timeline and numbers people were known to attend a rave. These events happened almost every weekend. The noise and disturbance of thousands of people appearing at parties in rural locations, such as Genesis '88, caused outrage in the national media. The British government made the fine for holding an illegal party ¬£20,000 and six months in prison. Police crackdowns on these often-illegal parties drove the scene into the countryside. The word \\"rave\\" somehow caught on to describe these semi-spontaneous weekend parties occurring at various locations outside the M25 Orbital motorway that now attracted up to 25 000. Sound systems from this time include Spiral Tribe and DiY. In the 1990s raves began to expand into a global phenomenon. Around 1989-1992 people who had travelled to attend the first raves began setting up promotion companies in each region to organize their own parties. This happened on a grassroots basis, often informally. By the mid-1990s, major corporations were sponsoring events and adopting the scene's music and fashion for their \\"edgier\\" advertising, making the scene become more commercialized. After sensational coverage in the tabloids, culminating in a particularly large rave (near Castlemorton) in May 1992, the government acted on what was depicted as a growing menace. In 1994, the United Kingdom's Criminal Justice Bill passed as the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 which contained several sections designed to suppress the growing free party and anti-road protest movements (sometimes embodied by ravers and travellers). By the early 2000s, the term \\"rave\\" had fallen out of favour among some people in the electronic dance music community, particularly in Europe. Many Europeans identify themselves as \\"clubbers\\" rather than ravers. The term 'free party' has been used for sometime and can be seen on the Spiral Tribe video 'Forward the Revolution' in 1992. It tried to disconnect raves from big commercial events of the early nineties to a more anarchist version of a party. Some communities preferred the term \\"festival\\", while others simply referred to \\"parties\\". With less constrictive laws allowing raves to continue long after the United Kingdom tried to ban them, more anarchic raves continue to occur in Central Europe and France, where the law says there can be only 4 teknivals per year (2 in the south, 2 in the north). In France the larger teknivals can attract up to 30 000 people in a three-day period. The terms free party and squat party have become the predominant terms used to describe an illegal party. The term \\"rave\\" is still often used to describe an unlicensed party in some parts of the United Kingdom, particularly the South East ‚Äì perhaps because larger licensed \\"rave\\" events have become less common due to anti-drugs enforcement causing venue owners to be wary of hosting them. Free parties tend to be on the boundaries of law and are strongly discouraged by government authorities, occasionally using aggressive police tactics. Typical party Free parties are much like other rave parties, their main distinction being that the venue is free to use. The result is that they are often held in isolated outdoor venues or abandoned buildings, where they are also known as squat parties. If the building has a power source that is used but if not then the organisers will use generators. Often free parties involve a lot of (mostly illegal) dance drug use. The music played at free parties is very bass heavy. It is for this reason that they are usually held in isolated venues or places where police interference is unlikely, such as protected squatting residences (particularly in the UK, where police used not to be able to enter a squat easily). The types of music played are usually various forms of dance music with fast repetitive beats, but, due to the lack of a commercial interest, the genre chosen is often far from popular mainstream tastes and is decided purely by the tastes of the DJs who play for the sound systems putting the event on. Each sound system has its own music policy, following and entourage. The current trend is towards breakcore and gabba or, in another musical direction, psy-trance but many sound systems still play traditional techno, Acid Techno, Hard Trance and Electro House/Techno, Drum & Bass/Jungle, Hardtek, Tekstep and more recently ‚Äì it's not uncommon to hear Dubstep being played. Some parties in England, but also across Europe such as in the Netherlands, now incorporate elements of performance art (\\"synthetic circus\\") as well as electronic dance music. Due to the lack of licensing restrictions, these parties often start after midnight and continue through the night until morning, often longer. Parties lasting several days are not uncommon; some large teknivals can go on for a week. Squat parties have an overt or implied radical left-wing stance. The squat party community embraces autonomous, anarchistic principles by refusing to recognize the right of any third-party authority to decide when and how people should congregate. Squat party organizers also eschew capitalistic values by putting on parties which benefit the community and its artists instead of to turn a profit. Occasionally, squat parties act as ad-hoc information points where political pamphlets are distributed or petitions signed in order to raise awareness about a variety of causes, usually of a left-wing nature. London's Reclaim the Streets movement, which brought traffic and commerce to a standstill once a year in an attempt to draw public attention to inner city problems, was itself a highly visible and politicized affiliate of the U.K. squat party scene. Squat parties are occasionally held for the sole purpose of fund-raising, usually for humanitarian causes. Law and police :Missing laws regulating free parties outside the UK, see Talk:Free party =UK= Police out in force at CzechTek 2005 Under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 the definition of music played at a rave was given as: Sections 63, 64 & 65 of the Act targeted electronic dance music played at raves. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act empowered police to stop a rave in the open air when a hundred or more people are attending, or where two or more are making preparations for a rave. Section 65 allows any uniformed constable who believes a person is on their way to a rave within a five-mile radius to stop them and direct them away from the area; non-compliant citizens may be subject to a maximum fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale (¬£1 000). The Act was ostensibly introduced because of the noise and disruption caused by all night parties to nearby residents, and to protect the countryside. It has also been claimed that it was introduced to kill a popular youth movement that was taking many drinkers out of town centres drinking taxable alcohol and into fields to take untaxed drugs. The number of people attending and organising such an event for it to be deemed illegal were altered in the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 section 58 to cover indoor parties and outdoor parties of more than 20 people. It is also a crime if, within 24 hours of being told by a police officer to leave a rave, a person makes preparations to attend a rave. More recently in the United Kingdom, anti-social behaviour orders (ASBOs) have been used against unlicensed rave organisers if the police receive repeated complaints about noise and littering from locals. Despite these laws, free parties continue to exist. They do so in a number of ways. They can be small (with fewer than 100 people) and remote so that they are unlikely to cause distress to the local residents. If the police find out about the party and turn up, it is rarely worth the use of resources to attempt to arrest people and seize equipment. The people at the rave would then have to leave without having time to tidy up and potentially still incapable of driving safely. The other way free parties continue is to be large enough to make breaking them up difficult. When there are more than 500 or so people then there is a potential for a riot. A typical police response to why a rave was not stopped is: \\"officers had decided not to stop the rave because they had only received one complaint about noise and the amount of resources needed to stop it would not be justified.\\" In August 2006, an unlicensed party organised by united sounds ‚Äì Aztek, LowKey, One Love, Mission, Illicit, Monolith & Brains-Kan Sound Systems in Essex, England was broken up after 24 hours resulting in approx 60 injuries from both sides and over 50 arrests. This was one of the largest confrontations between police and ravers that had occurred at an unlicensed event for many years. The Chief Superintendent in charge of the police operation said \\"These sorts of raves are quite unheard of in this county - I have not seen this sort of violence since the old days of acid house.\\" Squat party A squat party is a party that takes place either in a disused building (broken into and secured for the party) or in an already existing squat. Squat parties are usually advertised either by word of mouth, postings on internet bulletin boards, flyers handed out at other similar events and through phone lines set up by the sound system(s) organising the event. This is for security reasons, since the organisers do not want the authorities finding out about them and trying to stop them. Other events might be much smaller acoustic nights run more like a cafe. Squatted buildings are often used as social centres and creative spaces for people to use. Most squat parties usually run for 12 to 24 hours, finishing when the organisers have had enough or if they are shut down by police. Most large cities in the UK have a squat party scene with London considered the most active location in the country. The majority of London squat parties occur in mainly industrial sectors e.g. East London, as abandoned warehouses make ideal venues and a smaller chance of residential noise complaints. The London squat party scene of recent years has seen an influx of European travellers, largely from the East, where there is also a large rave culture, for example events such as Czechtek. Squat parties are typically either free or charge a small donation on the door. Typically the organisers also try to make additional money through selling alcohol inside. Squat 'eviction' parties occur when the squatters residing in a building have been given a final date for their eviction, and as a final act of resistance organise a large scale party and protest in order to try to withstand the police or bailiffs. Drugs Drugs sale and use is long standing and accepted, most commonly MDMA (ecstasy), amphetamine, cocaine, LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, cannabis, nitrous oxide, and ketamine. Drugs are easily available at almost all free parties and people often use them to reduce the fatigue resulting from dancing for many hours, as well as for the recreational effects. In early years MDMA was the most common drug taken at parties, however over the last ten years there has been a steady increase in the popularity of ketamine in Europe, most noticeably in the London scene, where ketamine has a massive presence and has been said by some to have spoiled the atmosphere found at earlier parties. Since 2000 ketamine has crossed over from being almost entirely a drug found in the free party scene to one commonly found in mainstream clubs as well. Security Due to the drug culture and unregulated environment, security has become a problem for many party organisers. Some free party sound systems hire private security at events but security is only an issue in squat parties or very urban outdoor events. Outdoor parties have very little trouble. Parties become autonomous zones, with self-policing and control being established by all attendance. If people make trouble calling the police is not an option so sometimes the music is stopped and the trouble makers are simply told by all the party goers to leave. Locations Typical parties in the London scene range from small parties with a couple of hundred people up to huge multi-riggers involving a thousand or more people. The number of sound systems involved also varies ‚Äì small parties may have just one or two sound systems, larger parties may have anything up to 20 or more, including several \\"link-ups\\" where two or more sound systems will combine their rigs into a single large system. Although London is the central location for squat parties, they exist outside the capital and places such as Three Counties Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire & Cambridgeshire also Buckinghamshire have popular scenes dating pre 1995. Modern parties are usually hosted in Bedford, Norfolk, or London; but Cambridgeshire, Northampton and Suffolk still have a contemporary underground scene, along with Derbyshire, South Yorkshire and South Wales. Outdoor parties are popular all over Wales and the South West and can attract up to a thousand people. Outdoor parties are organised so that noise pollution is not a factor. If the local residents complain then the party is much more at risk of being stopped. In most big cities there is an underground counterculture centred around free parties which are predominantly outdoor parties in the summer and squat parties when it is too cold. Most organisers will try to secure a warehouse, if not they will look for a wooded area to hide themselves and try and soften the music and enjoy the outdoor environment also to avoid being discovered by the authorities.

He joined the band in 1997 after the departure of band founder Max Cavalera. Early life Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Green is the youngest of three children; his sister Ren√©e Green is an artist, writer, and filmmaker. Green's father, Friendly, an electrician, and mother, Gloria, a music teacher, moved the family from inner- city Cleveland to surbuban Shaker Heights when Green was 7. \\"This was my first live interaction with white people,\\" Green later recalled. From an early age, Green knew he wanted to leave the United States and he lived in Berlin for a time before moving from New York to S√£o Paulo. Music career =Pre- Sepultura= Green became a friend and roadie of the already formed thrash metal/hardcore band Outface which was formed in 1985. He then joined the band in 1986 at the age of 15 after the departure of their two former singers. The band consisted of guitarist Charlie Garriga (CIV), bassist Frank Cavanagh (Prong and Filter) and drummer Mark Konopka. They recorded two demos, one in 1987 and the other in 1989. They were then offered a recording deal by a friend from New York, Walter Schreifels (Quicksand, Youth of Today, Gorilla Biscuits) for a recording deal to record for his new sub label of Crisis Records for one studio album, Friendly Green, released in 1992. Stylistically, their music varied between rock, heavy metal and punk with ska elements. Green was credited as Simon Verde on the Outface release (\\"Green\\" is translated as \\"Verde\\" in Spanish, Italian and Portuguese). With this lineup they toured and played in many places on the east coast and the south of the United States and one tour in Europe. Once back from the tour in Europe, Green and Garriga decided that they wanted to move to New York City. Cavanagh stayed and later went on to join the band Filter. Konopka also decided to stay and recorded one album with the band Integrity. In New York, Green and Garriga teamed up with drummer Sammy Siegler (Side by Side, Youth of Today, Judge), bass player Eric Thrice (Orange 9mm), who was replaced by Sara Cox, to form Overfiend. The band was named after the brutal Japanese animated film Legend of the Overfiend. They recorded a three-song demo with the help of Schreifels, the direction was much heavier with influences of metal and heavy rock. Their first show was played in Staten Island opening for Sick of It All. This would be their only show. Garriga and Siegler would leave the band to join and form CIV. In 1996, Green would start to play guitar and sing with Sara Cox, they would then form the band Alpha Jerk. They later recruited drummer Luke Abby (Warzone, Gorilla Biscuits), who was then replaced by Nick Heller (Sweet Diesel). They would release one self-titled album on Toybox Records. They managed to play a few shows in the New York area and doing a few shows together with the bands Lunachicks and Demonspeed. Two songs were featured on New York's Hardest, Vol. 2 compilation. =Sepultura= Green was approached in 1997 by A&R; rep Mike Gitter from Roadrunner Records. He told him that Sepultura frontman Max Cavalera had left the band in 1996 and they were searching for a new vocalist. He suggested Green try out for the position. Sepultura had recorded one song with no vocals to see what people all around the world could come up with. Green got a hold of the tape from Gitter and he recorded his idea for the song \\"Choke\\" and sent it to Brazil. A month later he received a phone call from Sepultura's drummer, Igor Cavalera. He was then asked to fly down to S√£o Paulo, Brazil to meet everyone and audition for the position. Green flew out a week later and met everyone and auditioned for two weeks. Green was asked to come back to Brazil to start recording his first album, Against, with Sepultura. Green performing in 2009 Most of Against was written before Green entered the band. Against was released in 1998 and the group set out on a world tour. Green moved from New York and decided to live in Amsterdam while on a promo tour. The album was critically and commercially less successful than previous Sepultura albums, as many fans were still coming to terms with the absence of Max Cavalera from the band. AllMusic gave the album 3 stars out of 5, and gave an optimistic note of the band's future by stating that \\"there are enough flashes of the old Sepultura brilliance to suggest that great things are still to come\\". Nation would be the first album that Green would take part in the writing process for, from beginning to end. He decided to move to S√£o Paulo to be closer to the group and work on the new material. Nation, the band's eighth album with Roadrunner Records, was released in 2001 and sold poorly. Allmusic.com gave the album 3 stars out of 5 and said, \\"As Green scrapes the lining of his vocal chords through the brash, impassioned tracks, he's singing about more than just 'one tribe, Sepulnation'; he's suggesting something bigger, something worth shouting about and fighting for\\". In an interview, Derrick said about the album that \\"every song will be related to the idea of building this idea of a positive nation. We will have our own flag, our own anthem, our own army\\". Nation was the group's last studio album with Roadrunner Records, as their contract ran out. The contract had an option for one more album but the group felt the label was not supportive enough. A recording of Max Cavalera's last live show with Sepultura, titled Under a Pale Grey Sky, was released in 2002 by Roadrunner Records, against the wishes of the band. Revolusongs, an EP of cover songs was released by the band. The EP was exclusively released in Brazil and Japan, but then the band was picked up by record label SPV and Revolusongs was later included as a bonus disc on the digipak edition of Roorback, the next full-length studio album with Green. A collaboration between the video director Ricardo Della Rosa and Green created the idea of the music video of U2's song \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\". It won best photography in the 2003 Brazil MTV music awards show. Despite Roorback receiving critical acclaim, sales remained low. Allmusic gave the album 4 stars out of 5 and said, \\"if there are still any lingering doubts about the Green/Sepultura match, 2003's excellent Roorback should put them to rest for good. Green is passionate and focused throughout the album ‚Äîhe has no problem going that extra mile‚Äî and the writing is consistently strong\\". All the tracks on the DVD Live in S√£o Paulo were recorded on April 3, 2005, at a concert in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. A CD of the same name was also recorded. Both were released on November 8, 2005, through SPV Records. The second DVD features a documentary of the band's career from 1998 on, filmed and co-edited by Green. Dante XXI was released on March 14, 2006. It is a concept album based on Dante's The Divine Comedy, a book that Green read in high school and suggested to the band for the concept for the album. In \\"Convicted in Life\\" video, Green collaborated with the video director Luis Carone for the idea. The video won for best editing in a video and best direction in a video at the Brazil MTV music awards show in 2006. Allmusic gave the album 3.5 stars out of 5 and said that, \\"Overall, Dante XXI is easily one of Sepultura's strongest releases to feature Green on vocals\\". Igor Cavalera left the band after the release of Dante XXI. He was replaced by Brazilian drummer Jean Dolabella who they continued with and toured with for the most part of the Dante XXI tour. Green at the Nova Rock Festival 2014 Sepultura released the album A-Lex on January 26, 2009. A-Lex is a concept album based on Anthony Burgess' book A Clockwork Orange. Allmusic gave the album 4 stars out of 5 and said that \\"personnel changes can have a very negative effect on a band, but Sepultura have maintained their vitality all these years ‚Äì and that vitality is alive and well on the superb A-Lex\\". On July 6, 2010, it was announced that Sepultura have signed a deal with Nuclear Blast Records, and will release their first album Kairos for the label in 2011. Roy Z (Judas Priest, Halford, Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson, Helloween) was the producer for the new album. =Musica Diablo= Green joined another band, Musica Diablo, in 2008, a thrash metal band with members of Nitrominds, A√ß√£o Direta and Dead Fish. On May 28, 2010, the band released their self-titled debut album on both CD and MP3 download. CD Universe said that \\"Musica Diablo's extreme fast thrash metal, with the characteristic Brazilian style and a strong root into the 1980s veterans made them unique, and the need of recording a proper album was eminent. The band recorded their first album in January 2010 with the well known producer Rafael Ramos in Rio de Janeiro. A month later, Derrick Green recorded his vocals in S√£o Paulo, again under Rafael's production. The result is a killer, blast-in-your-face album with 11 songs of sheer violence and pure Brazilian Thrash Metal!\\". Green has since left Musica Diablo. =Collaborations= Green was a guest vocalist on a few CDs including Biohazard's Uncivilization and the soundtrack of the Brazilian movie Lisbela e o Prisioneiro. Green appeared with Sepultura in a successful ad campaign for Volkswagen motors commercial that aired nationally throughout Brazil in 2008. The spot said that \\"it's the first time you've seen Sepultura like this. And a sedan like this one too\\". This Volkswagen TV spot shows Sepultura playing bossa nova, the opposite of its Heavy Metal style, to say that \\"you never saw something like this, as you never saw a car like the new Voyage\\". Green is working on a three volume book set of his photography and writings due to be released in late 2011/2012. Each volume will be released at different times. Green is working on a side project called Maximum Hedrum.  Personal life  In 2011, when asked about his religious views, Green replied: Green speaks fluent Portuguese with a strong American accent. He lives in Carapicu√≠ba S√£o Paulo. Green is a vegan. He has been a vegetarian since 1986. He made this publicly clear in a PETA video interview regarding Sepultura's 2006 video of the song \\"Convicted in Life\\". Derrick stated in the interview that the subject of this video is that some kind of \\"karma\\" is inflicted on those that damage the environment and its wildlife.

Interstellar arks may be the most economically feasible method of traveling such distances. The ark has also been proposed as a potential habitat to preserve civilization and knowledge in the event of a global catastrophe. Such a ship would have to be large, requiring a large power plant. The Project Orion concept of propulsion by nuclear pulses has been proposed. The largest spacecraft design analyzed in Project Orion had a 400 m diameter and weighed approximately 8 million tons. It could be large enough to host a city of 100,000 or more people.  Thrust concepts  Another concern is selection of power sources and mechanisms which would remain viable for the long time spans involved in interstellar travel through the desert of space. The longest lived space probes are the Voyager program probes, which use radioisotope thermoelectric generators having a useful lifespan of a mere 50 years. One propulsion method for a crewed spacecraft could be a fusion microexplosion nuclear pulse propulsion system, like that proposed in Project Daedalus that may allow it to obtain an interstellar cruising velocity of up to 10% of the speed of light. However, if the ship is capable of transits requiring hundreds of thousands of years, chemical and gravitational slingshot propulsion may be sufficient.R.W. Moir and W.L.

Laffer is best known for the Laffer curve, an illustration of the concept that there exists some tax rate between 0% and 100% that will result in maximum tax revenue for government. In certain circumstances, this would allow governments to cut taxes, and simultaneously increase revenue and economic growth. Laffer was an economic advisor to Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. On June 19, 2019, President Donald Trump awarded Laffer with the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his contributions in the field of economics. Early life and education Laffer was born in Youngstown, Ohio, the son of Marian Amelia \\"Molly\\" (n√©e Betz), a homemaker and politician, and William Gillespie Laffer, president of the Clevite Corporation. He was raised in the Cleveland, Ohio area. He is a Presbyterian, and graduated from Cleveland's University School high school in 1958. Laffer earned a B.A. in economics from Yale University (1963) and an M.B.A. (1965) and a Ph.D. in economics (1972) from Stanford University.  Academia  Laffer was an Associate Professor of Business Economics at the University of Chicago from 1970 to 1976 and a member of the Chicago faculty from 1967 through 1976. From 1976 to 1984 Laffer held the status as the Charles B. Thornton Professor of Business Economics at the University of Southern California School of Business. During this time Laffer helped pass Proposition 13, the California initiative that drastically cut property taxes in the state in 1978. In the mid-1980s, Laffer was the Distinguished University Professor at Pepperdine University in Malibu, and a member of the Pepperdine Board of Directors.  Politics  Laffer was the first to hold the title of Chief Economist at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under George Shultz from October 1970 to July 1972. During the years 1972 to 1977, Laffer was a consultant to Secretary of the Treasury William Simon, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of the Treasury George Shultz. Laffer was a member of President Reagan's Economic Policy Advisory Board for both of his terms (1981‚Äì1989) and was a founding member of the Reagan Executive Advisory Committee for the presidential race of 1980. Laffer served as a member of the Executive Committee of the Reagan/Bush Finance Committee in 1984. In 1986, Laffer was a candidate for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate‚Äîwhich he lost in the California primary to U.S. Congressman Ed Zschau, who lost in the general election to the incumbent, Democrat Alan Cranston. Laffer identifies himself as a staunch fiscal conservative. However, he has stated publicly that he voted for President Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996. Laffer references President Clinton's conservative fiscal and unregulated market policies as cornerstones of his support.Arthur B. Laffer and Stephen Moore,Return to Prosperity, Threshold Editions, p. 26, Feb 2010 In 2018, Laffer wrote the book Trumponomics with conservative economic commentator Stephen Moore, wherein they lauded the Trump administration's economic policies. In the book, Moore and Laffer argue that the Trump administration's 2017 tax plan would raise growth rates to as much as 6% and not increase budget deficits. In a 2019 review of the book, Greg Mankiw, a conservative economics professor at Harvard University, said the authors \\"do not build their analysis on the foundation of professional consensus or serious studies from peer-reviewed journals. . . . The Laffer curve is undeniable as a matter of economic theory. There is certainly some level of taxation at which cutting tax rates would be win-win. But few economists believe that tax rates in the United States have reached such heights in recent years; to the contrary, they are likely below the revenue- maximizing level.\\" The one issue where Moore and Laffer disagree with Trump is on the issue of free trade, which the duo supports. Previously, in 2016, Laffer said that he believed that then-candidate Trump was \\"going to be okay on trade\\" and lauded Trump's understanding of trade. Laffer regularly writes opinion articles in The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Times. On April 15, 2019, Laffer blamed the Great Recession on Barack Obama, \\"who I believe was the reason why we had the Great Recession. As he got closer and closer to winning the markets collapsed.\\" In 2020, Laffer advised the Trump administration on how to re-open the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. = Presidential Medal of Freedom = Laffer receives the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Trump in 2019 On May 31, 2019, The White House announced that President Trump would be awarding Laffer with the Presidential Medal of Freedom on June 19, 2019. The Presidential Medal of Freedom is \\"the Nation's highest civilian honor, which may be awarded by the President to individuals who have made especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, to world peace, or to cultural or other significant public or private endeavors\\". The White House press released stated that Laffer was receiving the award for \\"public service and contributions to economic policy that have helped spur prosperity for our Nation\\". The press release said that Laffer as \\"one of the most influential economists in American history\\" due to popularizing the \\"Laffer Curve.\\" Trump praised Laffer for policies that he said brought \\"greater opportunity for all Americans.\\" Laffer curve Although he does not claim to have invented the Laffer curve concept (Laffer, 2004), it was popularized with policy-makers following an afternoon meeting with Nixon/Ford Administration officials Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld in 1974 in which he reportedly sketched the curve on a napkin to illustrate his argument. The term \\"Laffer curve\\" was coined by Jude Wanniski, who was also present. The basic concept was not new; Laffer himself says he learned it from Ibn Khaldun and John Maynard Keynes. The Laffer curve is an economic theory that shows the relationship between tax rates and the amount of tax revenue collected by governments. The Laffer Curve shows that there is a certain point between 0% and 100% where tax revenues are maximized. The curve suggests that starting from zero, an increase in tax rates will increase the government's tax revenue; after a certain point, however, continuing to increase tax rates will cause a decrease in tax revenue. This decrease in tax revenue can be explained by decreased incentives for work, production, etc. Laffer's postulate was that the tax rate that maximizes revenue was at a much lower level than previously believed: so low that current tax rates were above the level where revenue is maximized. While many economists believe that government spending to stimulate demand for products should be the solution for a poorly performing economy, Laffer argues that heavy taxes and regulation impede production, and therefore, government revenue. Numerous leading economists have rejected the view that a tax rate cut of current federal US income taxes can lead to increased tax revenue. When asked whether a \\"cut in federal income tax rates in the US right now would raise taxable income enough so that the annual total tax revenue would be higher within five years than without the tax cut,\\" 96% of economists surveyed in 2012 disagreed.http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/laffer-curve According to Greg Mankiw, most economists have been very skeptical of Laffer's contention that decreases in tax rates could increase tax revenue, at least in the United States. In his textbook, Mankiw states, \\"there was little evidence for Laffer's view that U.S. tax rates had in fact reached such extreme levels.\\" Under the direction of conservative economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the Congressional Budget Office conducted a 2005 study on the fiscal effects of a 10% cut in federal income tax rates, finding that it resulted in a significant net revenue loss.Analyzing the Economic and Budgetary Effects of a 10 Percent Cut in Income Tax Rates, Congressional Budget Office, December 1, 2005:https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/109th- congress-2005-2006/reports/12-01-10percenttaxcut.pdf Economist John Quiggin distinguishes between the Laffer curve and Laffer's analysis of tax rates. The Laffer curve was \\"correct but unoriginal\\", but Laffer's analysis that the United States was on the wrong side of the Laffer curve \\"was original but incorrect.\\" Laffer was an economic adviser to Kansas Governor Sam Brownback, who in 2012 zeroed out state tax liability for approximately 330,000 of the top wage earners in the state, contending it would be a \\"shot of adrenaline into the heart of the Kansas economy.\\"Topeka Capital Journal, 2013 The state, which had previously had a budget surplus, experienced a budget deficit of about $200 million in 2012. Drastic cuts to state funding for education and infrastructure were implemented to close budget deficits and the Kansas economy underperformed relative to neighboring states.Kansas City Star, 2015 Brownback's tax overhaul was described in a June 2017 article in The Atlantic as the United States' \\"most aggressive experiment in conservative economic policy\\". The drastic tax cuts had \\"threatened the viability of schools and infrastructure\\" in Kansas. The Kansas legislature repealed the tax cut in June 2017, overriding the veto of governor Brownback.

They were fronted by mainstay member, Graeme Revell on keyboards and percussion. In 1980 the group travelled to the United Kingdom where they issued their debut album, Information Overload Unit. In 1983 Sinan Leong joined on lead vocals. The group disbanded in 1988. Two years later Revell and Leong relocated to the United States, where Revell works as a Hollywood film score composer. According to Australian rock music historian Ian McFarlane, SPK were \\"at the forefront of the local post-punk, electronic/experimental movement of the late 1970s ... [their] music progressed from discordant, industrial-strength metal noise to sophisticated and restrained dance-rock with strange attributes\\". History SPK was formed in 1978 in Sydney when New Zealand-born Graeme Revell (a.k.a. \\"EMS AKS\\", \\"Operator\\", \\"Oblivion\\") met Neil Hill (a.k.a. \\"Ne/H/il\\"). Revell was working as a nurse on a psychiatric ward at Callan Park Hospital where Hill was also working. Hill and Revell shared a house and an interest in the manifesto of the German radical Marxist group known as the Sozialistisches Patientenkollektiv (SPK). The duo were influenced by Kraftwerk, Can, Neu!, Faust, and John Cage ‚Äì they started playing their own variety of industrial music as SPK. According to rock music historian Ian McFarlane the acronym SPK is variously given as \\"SoliPsiK, SepPuKu, Surgical Penis Klinik, System Planning Korporation and Sozialistisches Patienten Kollektiv\\". The band recruited two teenagers, Danny Rumour (later of The Cruel Sea) on lead guitar and David Virgin on bass guitar (both ex-Ugly Mirrors, and went on to form Sekret Sekret), on early recordings by SPK in 1979. In that year they independently released three 7\\" pressings: SoliPsiK as a three-track extended play in April, \\"Factory\\" as a single in August and \\"Mekano\\" in November. Dominik Guerin (a.k.a. \\"Tone Generator\\") joined on synthesisers in 1980, and later concentrated on the band's visual content. In May they issued an EP, Meat Processing Section, as Surgical Penis Klinik. Without Hill, SPK relocated to London where Guerin and Revell recorded their debut album, Information Overload Unit, in a Vauxhall squat with the help of Revell's brother Ashley Revell (a.k.a. \\"Mr.Clean\\") and Mike Wilkins (guitar, bass guitar, backing vocals). The album deals with psychotic states and mental retardation. The original 1981 release on Side Effects has a black cover with a small picture of head being operated on, the 1985 version on Normal is blue and pictures a man in a wheelchair and the 1992 CD reissue has System Planning Korporation with the initials SPK highlighted in red. McFarlane suggested \\"the album's harsh, thumping sound appealed to fans of Throbbing Gristle and early Cabaret Voltaire\\". In June 1980 they issued the single, \\"Slogun\\", with lyrics inspired by the Marxist manifesto: \\"Kill, Kill, Kill for inner peace / Bomb, Bomb, Bomb for mental health / Therapy through violence!\\" Other musicians working with SPK included James Pinker (drums, percussion) and Karel van Bergan (violin, vocals), who toured with them to the United States. In July 1981 in Australia, the M Squared label released another single, \\"See Saw\\". The cover depicts SoliPsiK with members given as Kitka (a.k.a. Kit Katalog), Sushi (a.k.a. Margaret Hill), Charlyiev (a.k.a. Paul Charlier) and Skorne (Neil Hill). Both tracks are co-written by Charlier and Hill. In 1982 SPK's Guerin and Revell were joined by Brian Williams (a.k.a. Lustmord), John Murphy of Forresta di Ferro (a.k.a. \\"Kraang\\") and Derek Thompson (who later had a brief stint in The Cure and went on to record as Hoodlum Priest). SPK's second album, Leichenschrei (English: The Scream of the Corpse) (1982), shows Sozialistisches Patienten Kollektiv (English: Socialist Patients' Collective). After its recording they were joined by Sinan Leong on vocals, who had initially auditioned for a planned SPK side-project, Dance Macabre. Leong and Revell later married. In 1983 Thompson left SPK because Revell \\"wanted to make a very commercial sounding album which I did not\\". McFarlane found that \\"SPK had softened the approach somewhat with discernible synth melodies and dance beats coming to the fore amongst the noise\\". In August 1983, the group issued a compilation album, Auto Da F√©, showing SepPuKu written with SPK in red capital letters. It included three studio tracks recorded in 1981. Bush suggested the album was the \\"beginning of a more organized approach for SPK material, Auto Da-F√© presents an intriguing industrial-disco fusion, reminiscent of prime contemporary material by Cabaret Voltaire and DAF ... Although fans probably thought of [it] as an unconscionable crossover attempt, it's still quite experimental in retrospect\\". The three-track EP, Dekompositiones (also by SepPuKu) followed soon after. Its tracks were added to a later version of Auto Da F√©. In early February 1984, just before his 28th birthday, Neil Hill committed suicide. Two days later his wife Margaret Hill (n√©e Nikitenko) died as a result of complications from anorexia. In March SPK issued another single, \\"Metal Dance\\", which was co-written by Revell, Leong and Thompson. SPK returned to Australia for a tour and recorded their third album, Machine Age Voodoo, in Sydney which was issued in 1984 on WEA Records. For the album, SPK's Revell and Leong were joined by Jeff Bartolomei on keyboards, Mary Bradfield-Taylor on vocals, Graham Jesse on saxophone, James Kelly on guitar, Sam McNally on keyboards and Phil Scorgie on bass guitar. McFarlane saw the album as \\"mixed mainstream disco-pop and sweet vocals with electronic experimentation (sort of like Blondie meets Kraftwerk)\\". While Bush felt it was \\"another leap towards dance-rock and away from the group's industrial past\\". The album spawned a single, \\"Junk Funk\\" in 1985. Leong and Revell returned to Australia and added Karina Hayes as vocalist. They issued Zamia Lehmanni: Songs of Byzantine Flowers in 1986 which provided a single, \\"In Flagrante Delicto\\". It was followed by Digitalis Ambigua: Gold & Poison in 1987. Allmusic's Sean Carruthers observed that Revell \\"was in a period of transition... [s]omewhere between the industrial noise of the early years and his later soundtrack work\\". In 1988, the band issued a live album, Oceania... In Performance 1987 but disbanded during the year. In 1989, Revell moved into work on scores and soundtracks. SPK's track \\"In Flagrante Delicto\\" was used by Revell for his work on the soundtrack for the 1989 film, Dead Calm. By 1991 Leong and Revell had moved to Los Angeles. McFarlane regarded SPK to be \\"at the forefront of the local post-punk, electronic/experimental movement of the late 1970s ... [their] music progressed from discordant, industrial-strength metal noise to sophisticated and restrained dance-rock with strange attributes\\". Acronym The meaning of SPK is deliberately unclear; and some of the album covers suggest several different variations. The most well known is Sozialistisches Patienten Kollektiv, but there are also others, such as Surgical Penis Klinik, Suave Poronga Kinoto, System Planning Korporation, SepPuKu, Selective Pornography Kontrol, Special Programming Korps, Sushi Patata Kalabacita and SoliPsiK Works The most notable recordings of SPK are early: Information Overload Unit, Leichenschrei and Auto-da-f√©. SPK's music is best described as disturbing and psychologically disorienting, in line with their nihilistic, subversive philosophy. Live performances included video backing (some of which was issued in two Twin Vison videos, Despair and Two Autopsy Films), transgressive performances with animal carcasses and other attempts to make the audience uncomfortable. The group issued manifestos, such as DoKuments 1 and 2, \\"The Post-Industrial Strategy\\", which appeared in RE/Search's Industrial Culture Handbook. There is a clear dichotomy between early industrial SPK (1978‚Äì83) and the more commercial music later favoured by Revell. Later releases, such as Machine Age Voodoo (1984), were more synthpop- oriented than industrial. Still later, the group moved into electronic orchestral work, with the release of Zamia Lehmanni: Songs of Byzantine Flowers (1986).

A moment of silence (sometimes referred to as a minute's silence or a one-minute silence) is a period of silent contemplation, prayer, reflection, or meditation. Similar to flying a flag at half-mast, a moment of silence is often a gesture of respect, particularly in mourning for those who have died recently or as part of a tragic historical event. One minute is a common length of time for the commemoration, though organizers may choose other periods of time, normally connected in some way with the event being commemorated (there might be a minute given for every death commemorated, for example). During the moment of silence, participants may typically bow their heads, remove hats, and refrain from speaking or moving for the duration. Most recently, there was a long eight minute and forty-six second moment of silence after the death of George Floyd. Origins The first recorded instance of an official moment of silence dedicated to a person's death took place in Portugal on February 13, 1912. The Portuguese Senate dedicated 10 minutes of silence to Jos√© Maria da Silva Paranhos J√∫nior, baron of Rio Branco, Brazil, and Minister of the Exterior of the Brazilian government, who had died three days earlier on February 10. This moment of silence was registered in the Senate's records of that day. In the same year, large parts of the US kept a ceremonial silence to honour the dead of the Maine and the Titanic. Examples of recurring moments of silence Many people in the Commonwealth of Nations observe the two-minute silence at 11:00am on November 11 each year (Armistice Day) to remember sacrifices of members of the armed forces and of civilians in times of war. In addition, a two minutes of silence is also observed in the United Kingdom on the Sunday closest to 11th of November which is known as Remembrance Sunday and is televised with a close up image of the Big Ben clock chiming 11 and the buglers sounding the Last Post at 11:02am. In Israel, moments of silence are held in memory of the victims of the Holocaust on Yom HaShoah and in memory of fallen soldiers and of terrorist victims on the day before Israel's independence day. Moments of silence are often observed prior to sports matches, with reasons for silences ranging from national and international tragedies, to the death of individuals connected to the sport or specific clubs. Silent prayer Quakers have practised silent prayer, including moments of silence during other group activities, for more than 300 years. Since silence contains no statements or assumptions concerning beliefs and requires no understanding of language to interpret, it is more easily accepted and used than a spoken prayer or observance when persons of different religious and cultural backgrounds participate together. In the colonial period Pennsylvania Quakers and other Americans worshipped silently together on occasions, yet both groups thought that this implied that they had altered their traditional belief system in doing so. Over time, the effectiveness of Quaker-style silence for non-sectarian and non-controversial public observances has led to its almost universal use in the English-speaking world as well as in other plural societies. This is also the case within many institutions where diverse groups are expected to participate but not necessarily share beliefs - such as in government, schools, commercial companies and the military. Moment of silence in US schools First Lady Michelle Obama and President Barack Obama return to the White House after leading a moment of silence for the victims of the 2011 Tucson shooting. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1962 that official organization, sponsorship, or endorsement of school prayer in public schools is forbidden by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Teachers and school officials may not lead classes in prayer, but prayer is permitted at voluntary religious clubs, and students are not prohibited from praying themselves. Other rulings have forbidden public, organized prayer at school assemblies, sporting events, and similar school-sponsored activities. Public moments of silence in the United States both arise from and contribute to this debate over prayer and the separation of church and state. A moment of silence lacks any specific religious formulation, and therefore it has been presented as a way of creating reflection and respect without endorsing any particular religion. President Ronald Reagan was a supporter of a moment of silence in American schools. In 1981 Reagan formally proposed a constitutional amendment permitting organized prayer in public schools.https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/18/us/reagan-proposes-school-prayer- amendment.html In his 1984 state of the union address, Reagan asked Congress, who begin their day with an invocation: \\"If you can begin your day with a member of the clergy standing right here leading you in prayer, then why can't freedom to acknowledge God be enjoyed again by children in every schoolroom across this land?\\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=40205 Colin Powell, a longtime advocate, has recommended a simple moment of silence at the start of each school day. Further, he states that students could use this interval to pray, meditate, contemplate or study.Colin Powel, A \\"MOMENT OF SILENCE\\" IN PLACE OF PRAYER IN U.S. PUBLIC SCHOOLS. Religious Tolerance. However, critics often view the moment of silence as publicly endorsing prayer \\"in disguise\\". This issue has been especially raised by atheists groups and advocates, who argue that no non-religious purpose is served by designating an official moment of silence. Moments of silence point to the tension in the U.S. Constitution and society between accommodation and endorsement. Accommodation of religion is to ensure an environment where a person or student can practice their religion. A question with \\"moments of silence\\" laws is whether accommodation was already achieved by the fact that a student can pray or meditate on his/her own without an official moment of silence. Barry Lynn of Americans United for Separation of Church and State said, on a \\"moment of silence\\" case, \\"Students were already allowed to pray, meditate, or reflect under the statute before it was amended. The addition of the word 'pray' where it wasn't needed clearly shows that legislators intended to promote religion, and that's not their job.\\" Courts have stated on these moments of silence cases that a secular purpose is necessary and according to Wallace v. Jaffree, a \\"statute must be invalidated if it is entirely motivated by a purpose to advance religion.\\" Although since 1976 the state Virginia law permitted school districts to implement 60 seconds of silence at the start of each school day, in 1985, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that an Alabama \\"moment of silence or voluntary prayer\\" law was unconstitutional, in the case Wallace v. Jaffree. In April 2000, a new law came into being; requiring all Virginian public school students to observe a moment of silence. Also, in 2005, a law was passed in Indiana requiring all public schools to give students a chance to say the pledge of allegiance and observe a moment of silence every day. In October 2007, Illinois enacted legislation to require public schools to provide students with a moment of silence at the start of the school day, a statute that is currently being challenged in Illinois state courts. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, Alabama, Georgia,See Louisiana, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia also require such moments of quiet in the classroom. In more than 20 other states, teachers are allowed to decide whether they want such a classroom time-out. In October 2000, the U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton ruled that the \\"moment of silence\\" law was constitutional. Judge Hilton stated, \\"The court finds that the Commonwealth's daily observance of one minute of silence act is constitutional. The act was enacted for a secular purpose, does not advance or inhibit religion, nor is there excessive entanglement with religion... Students may think as they wish ‚Äì and this thinking can be purely religious in nature or purely secular in nature. All that is required is that they sit silently.\\"\\"Court upholds constitutionality of 'silence' law\\", Baptist Joint Committee. Report from the Capital, 2000-NOV-7, Page 3. His ruling was upheld in the 4th circuit. Others argued that the law was not enacted for a secular purpose, pointing to statements made by supporters of the legislation. State Senator Charles R. Hawkins (R-Pennsylvania) stated the moment of silence is \\"a very small measure to address a very large problem.\\" He also said, \\"Prayer is not a bad word in my vocabulary.\\" Kent Willis, Executive Director of the ACLU of Virginia, stated lawmakers are \\"at the very least placing Virginia law right on the line of separation of church and state or they are crossing it . . . the state is playing with fire here.\\" The American Civil Liberties Union was opposed to a proposed constitutional amendment by Newt Gingrich in the early 1990s which would have set aside a voluntary moment of prayer during the school day, which was later independently described by President Bill Clinton as a \\"moment of silence\\".

Since emerging in the late 19th century during the first modern wave of economic globalization, its evolution is marked by the establishment of central banks, multilateral treaties, and intergovernmental organizations aimed at improving the transparency, regulation, and effectiveness of international markets. In the late 1800s, world migration and communication technology facilitated unprecedented growth in international trade and investment. At the onset of World War I, trade contracted as foreign exchange markets became paralyzed by money market illiquidity. Countries sought to defend against external shocks with protectionist policies and trade virtually halted by 1933, worsening the effects of the global Great Depression until a series of reciprocal trade agreements slowly reduced tariffs worldwide. Efforts to revamp the international monetary system after World War II improved exchange rate stability, fostering record growth in global finance. A series of currency devaluations and oil crises in the 1970s led most countries to float their currencies. The world economy became increasingly financially integrated in the 1980s and 1990s due to capital account liberalization and financial deregulation. A series of financial crises in Europe, Asia, and Latin America followed with contagious effects due to greater exposure to volatile capital flows. The global financial crisis, which originated in the United States in 2007, quickly propagated among other nations and is recognized as the catalyst for the worldwide Great Recession. A market adjustment to Greece's noncompliance with its monetary union in 2009 ignited a sovereign debt crisis among European nations known as the Eurozone crisis. A country's decision to operate an open economy and globalize its financial capital carries monetary implications captured by the balance of payments. It also renders exposure to risks in international finance, such as political deterioration, regulatory changes, foreign exchange controls, and legal uncertainties for property rights and investments. Both individuals and groups may participate in the global financial system. Consumers and international businesses undertake consumption, production, and investment. Governments and intergovernmental bodies act as purveyors of international trade, economic development, and crisis management. Regulatory bodies establish financial regulations and legal procedures, while independent bodies facilitate industry supervision. Research institutes and other associations analyze data, publish reports and policy briefs, and host public discourse on global financial affairs. While the global financial system is edging toward greater stability, governments must deal with differing regional or national needs. Some nations are trying to systematically discontinue unconventional monetary policies installed to cultivate recovery, while others are expanding their scope and scale. Emerging market policymakers face a challenge of precision as they must carefully institute sustainable macroeconomic policies during extraordinary market sensitivity without provoking investors to retreat their capital to stronger markets. Nations' inability to align interests and achieve international consensus on matters such as banking regulation has perpetuated the risk of future global financial catastrophes. Thereby, necessitating initiative like the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 10 aimed at improving regulation and monitoring of global financial systems. History of international financial architecture  =Emergence of financial globalization: 1870‚Äì1914= transatlantic cable laid to connect North America and Europe. SS Great Eastern, a steamship which laid the transatlantic cable beneath the ocean. The world experienced substantial changes in the late 19th century which created an environment favorable to an increase in and development of international financial centers. Principal among such changes were unprecedented growth in capital flows and the resulting rapid financial center integration, as well as faster communication. Before 1870, London and Paris existed as the world's only prominent financial centers. Soon after, Berlin and New York grew to become major centres providing financial services for their national economies. An array of smaller international financial centers became important as they found market niches, such as Amsterdam, Brussels, Zurich, and Geneva. London remained the leading international financial center in the four decades leading up to World War I. The first modern wave of economic globalization began during the period of 1870‚Äì1914, marked by transportation expansion, record levels of migration, enhanced communications, trade expansion, and growth in capital transfers. During the mid-nineteenth century, the passport system in Europe dissolved as rail transport expanded rapidly. Most countries issuing passports did not require their carry, thus people could travel freely without them. The standardization of international passports would not arise until 1980 under the guidance of the United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organization. From 1870 to 1915, 36 million Europeans migrated away from Europe. Approximately 25 million (or 70%) of these travelers migrated to the United States, while most of the rest reached Canada, Australia and Brazil. Europe itself experienced an influx of foreigners from 1860 to 1910, growing from 0.7% of the population to 1.8%. While the absence of meaningful passport requirements allowed for free travel, migration on such an enormous scale would have been prohibitively difficult if not for technological advances in transportation, particularly the expansion of railway travel and the dominance of steam-powered boats over traditional sailing ships. World railway mileage grew from 205,000 kilometers in 1870 to 925,000 kilometers in 1906, while steamboat cargo tonnage surpassed that of sailboats in the 1890s. Advancements such as the telephone and wireless telegraphy (the precursor to radio) revolutionized telecommunication by providing instantaneous communication. In 1866, the first transatlantic cable was laid beneath the ocean to connect London and New York, while Europe and Asia became connected through new landlines. Economic globalization grew under free trade, starting in 1860 when the United Kingdom entered into a free trade agreement with France known as the Cobden‚ÄìChevalier Treaty. However, the golden age of this wave of globalization endured a return to protectionism between 1880 and 1914. In 1879, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduced protective tariffs on agricultural and manufacturing goods, making Germany the first nation to institute new protective trade policies. In 1892, France introduced the M√©line tariff, greatly raising customs duties on both agricultural and manufacturing goods. The United States maintained strong protectionism during most of the nineteenth century, imposing customs duties between 40 and 50% on imported goods. Despite these measures, international trade continued to grow without slowing. Paradoxically, foreign trade grew at a much faster rate during the protectionist phase of the first wave of globalization than during the free trade phase sparked by the United Kingdom. Unprecedented growth in foreign investment from the 1880s to the 1900s served as the core driver of financial globalization. The worldwide total of capital invested abroad amounted to US$44 billion in 1913 ($1.02 trillion in 2012 dollars), with the greatest share of foreign assets held by the United Kingdom (42%), France (20%), Germany (13%), and the United States (8%). The Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland together held foreign investments on par with Germany at around 12%. Panic of 1907 A crowd forms on Wall Street during the Panic of 1907. In October 1907, the United States experienced a bank run on the Knickerbocker Trust Company, forcing the trust to close on October 23, 1907, provoking further reactions. The panic was alleviated when U.S. Secretary of the Treasury George B. Cortelyou and John Pierpont \\"J.P.\\" Morgan deposited $25 million and $35 million, respectively, into the reserve banks of New York City, enabling withdrawals to be fully covered. The bank run in New York led to a money market crunch which occurred simultaneously as demands for credit heightened from cereal and grain exporters. Since these demands could only be serviced through the purchase of substantial quantities of gold in London, the international markets became exposed to the crisis. The Bank of England had to sustain an artificially high discount lending rate until 1908. To service the flow of gold to the United States, the Bank of England organized a pool from among twenty-four nations, for which the Banque de France temporarily lent ¬£3 million (GBP, 305.6 million in 2012 GBP) in gold. Birth of the U.S. Federal Reserve System: 1913 The United States Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act in 1913, giving rise to the Federal Reserve System. Its inception drew influence from the Panic of 1907, underpinning legislators' hesitance in trusting individual investors, such as John Pierpont Morgan, to serve again as a lender of last resort. The system's design also considered the findings of the Pujo Committee's investigation of the possibility of a money trust in which Wall Street's concentration of influence over national financial matters was questioned and in which investment bankers were suspected of unusually deep involvement in the directorates of manufacturing corporations. Although the committee's findings were inconclusive, the very possibility was enough to motivate support for the long-resisted notion of establishing a central bank. The Federal Reserve's overarching aim was to become the sole lender of last resort and to resolve the inelasticity of the United States' money supply during significant shifts in money demand. In addition to addressing the underlying issues that precipitated the international ramifications of the 1907 money market crunch, New York's banks were liberated from the need to maintain their own reserves and began undertaking greater risks. New access to rediscount facilities enabled them to launch foreign branches, bolstering New York's rivalry with London's competitive discount market. =Interwar period: 1915‚Äì1944= German infantry crossing a battlefield in France in August 1914. British soldiers resting before the Battle of Mons with German troops along the French border in August 1914. Economists have referred to the onset of World War I as the end of an age of innocence for foreign exchange markets, as it was the first geopolitical conflict to have a destabilizing and paralyzing impact. The United Kingdom declared war on Germany on August 4, 1914 following Germany's invasion of France and Belgium. In the weeks prior, the foreign exchange market in London was the first to exhibit distress. European tensions and increasing political uncertainty motivated investors to chase liquidity, prompting commercial banks to borrow heavily from London's discount market. As the money market tightened, discount lenders began rediscounting their reserves at the Bank of England rather than discounting new pounds sterling. The Bank of England was forced to raise discount rates daily for three days from 3% on July 30 to 10% by August 1. As foreign investors resorted to buying pounds for remittance to London just to pay off their newly maturing securities, the sudden demand for pounds led the pound to appreciate beyond its gold value against most major currencies, yet sharply depreciate against the French franc after French banks began liquidating their London accounts. Remittance to London became increasingly difficult and culminated in a record exchange rate of $6.50 USD/GBP. Emergency measures were introduced in the form of moratoria and extended bank holidays, but to no effect as financial contracts became informally unable to be negotiated and export embargoes thwarted gold shipments. A week later, the Bank of England began to address the deadlock in the foreign exchange markets by establishing a new channel for transatlantic payments whereby participants could make remittance payments to the U.K. by depositing gold designated for a Bank of England account with Canada's Minister of Finance, and in exchange receive pounds sterling at an exchange rate of $4.90. Approximately $104 million USD in remittances flowed through this channel in the next two months. However, pound sterling liquidity ultimately did not improve due to inadequate relief for merchant banks receiving sterling bills. As the pound sterling was the world's reserve currency and leading vehicle currency, market illiquidity and merchant banks' hesitance to accept sterling bills left currency markets paralyzed. The U.K. government attempted several measures to revive the London foreign exchange market, the most notable of which were implemented on September 5 to extend the previous moratorium through October and allow the Bank of England to temporarily loan funds to be paid back upon the end of the war in an effort to settle outstanding or unpaid acceptances for currency transactions. By mid- October, the London market began functioning properly as a result of the September measures. The war continued to present unfavorable circumstances for the foreign exchange market, such as the London Stock Exchange's prolonged closure, the redirection of economic resources to support a transition from producing exports to producing military armaments, and myriad disruptions of freight and mail. The pound sterling enjoyed general stability throughout World War I, in large part due to various steps taken by the U.K. government to influence the pound's value in ways that yet provided individuals with the freedom to continue trading currencies. Such measures included open market interventions on foreign exchange, borrowing in foreign currencies rather than in pounds sterling to finance war activities, outbound capital controls, and limited import restrictions. In 1930, the Allied powers established the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). The principal purposes of the BIS were to manage the scheduled payment of Germany's reparations imposed by the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, and to function as a bank for central banks around the world. Nations may hold a portion of their reserves as deposits with the institution. It also serves as a forum for central bank cooperation and research on international monetary and financial matters. The BIS also operates as a general trustee and facilitator of financial settlements between nations. Smoot‚ÄìHawley tariff of 1930 U.S. President Herbert Hoover signed the Smoot‚ÄìHawley Tariff Act into law on June 17, 1930. The tariff's aim was to protect agriculture in the United States, but congressional representatives ultimately raised tariffs on a host of manufactured goods resulting in average duties as high as 53% on over a thousand various goods. Twenty-five trading partners responded in kind by introducing new tariffs on a wide range of U.S. goods. Hoover was pressured and compelled to adhere to the Republican Party's 1928 platform, which sought protective tariffs to alleviate market pressures on the nation's struggling agribusinesses and reduce the domestic unemployment rate. The culmination of the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression heightened fears, further pressuring Hoover to act on protective policies against the advice of Henry Ford and over 1,000 economists who protested by calling for a veto of the act. Exports from the United States plummeted 60% from 1930 to 1933. Worldwide international trade virtually ground to a halt. The international ramifications of the Smoot-Hawley tariff, comprising protectionist and discriminatory trade policies and bouts of economic nationalism, are credited by economists with prolongment and worldwide propagation of the Great Depression. Formal abandonment of the Gold Standard Income per capita throughout the Great Depression as viewed from an international perspective. Triangles mark points at which nations abandoned the gold standard by suspending gold convertibility or devaluing their currencies against gold. The classical gold standard was established in 1821 by the United Kingdom as the Bank of England enabled redemption of its banknotes for gold bullion. France, Germany, the United States, Russia, and Japan each embraced the standard one by one from 1878 to 1897, marking its international acceptance. The first departure from the standard occurred in August 1914 when these nations erected trade embargoes on gold exports and suspended redemption of gold for banknotes. Following the end of World War I on November 11, 1918, Austria, Hungary, Germany, Russia, and Poland began experiencing hyperinflation. Having informally departed from the standard, most currencies were freed from exchange rate fixing and allowed to float. Most countries throughout this period sought to gain national advantages and bolster exports by depreciating their currency values to predatory levels. A number of countries, including the United States, made unenthusiastic and uncoordinated attempts to restore the former gold standard. The early years of the Great Depression brought about bank runs in the United States, Austria, and Germany, which placed pressures on gold reserves in the United Kingdom to such a degree that the gold standard became unsustainable. Germany became the first nation to formally abandon the post-World War I gold standard when the Dresdner Bank implemented foreign exchange controls and announced bankruptcy on July 15, 1931. In September 1931, the United Kingdom allowed the pound sterling to float freely. By the end of 1931, a host of countries including Austria, Canada, Japan, and Sweden abandoned gold. Following widespread bank failures and a hemorrhaging of gold reserves, the United States broke free of the gold standard in April 1933. France would not follow suit until 1936 as investors fled from the franc due to political concerns over Prime Minister L√©on Blum's government. Trade liberalization in the United States The disastrous effects of the Smoot‚ÄìHawley tariff proved difficult for Herbert Hoover's 1932 re-election campaign. Franklin D. Roosevelt became the 32nd U.S. president and the Democratic Party worked to reverse trade protectionism in favor of trade liberalization. As an alternative to cutting tariffs across all imports, Democrats advocated for trade reciprocity. The U.S. Congress passed the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act in 1934, aimed at restoring global trade and reducing unemployment. The legislation expressly authorized President Roosevelt to negotiate bilateral trade agreements and reduce tariffs considerably. If a country agreed to cut tariffs on certain commodities, the U.S. would institute corresponding cuts to promote trade between the two nations. Between 1934 and 1947, the U.S. negotiated 29 such agreements and the average tariff rate decreased by approximately one third during this same period. The legislation contained an important most-favored-nation clause, through which tariffs were equalized to all countries, such that trade agreements would not result in preferential or discriminatory tariff rates with certain countries on any particular import, due to the difficulties and inefficiencies associated with differential tariff rates. The clause effectively generalized tariff reductions from bilateral trade agreements, ultimately reducing worldwide tariff rates. =Rise of the Bretton Woods financial order: 1945= Assistant U.S. Treasury Secretary, Harry Dexter White (left) and John Maynard Keynes, honorary adviser to the U.K. Treasury at the inaugural meeting of the International Monetary Fund's Board of Governors in Savannah, Georgia, U.S., March 8, 1946. As the inception of the United Nations as an intergovernmental entity slowly began formalizing in 1944, delegates from 44 of its early member states met at a hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire for the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference, now commonly referred to as the Bretton Woods conference. Delegates remained cognizant of the effects of the Great Depression, struggles to sustain the international gold standard during the 1930s, and related market instabilities. Whereas previous discourse on the international monetary system focused on fixed versus floating exchange rates, Bretton Woods delegates favored pegged exchange rates for their flexibility. Under this system, nations would peg their exchange rates to the U.S. dollar, which would be convertible to gold at $35 USD per ounce. This arrangement is commonly referred to as the Bretton Woods system. Rather than maintaining fixed rates, nations would peg their currencies to the U.S. dollar and allow their exchange rates to fluctuate within a 1% band of the agreed-upon parity. To meet this requirement, central banks would intervene via sales or purchases of their currencies against the dollar. Members could adjust their pegs in response to long-run fundamental disequillibria in the balance of payments, but were responsible for correcting imbalances via fiscal and monetary policy tools before resorting to repegging strategies. The adjustable pegging enabled greater exchange rate stability for commercial and financial transactions which fostered unprecedented growth in international trade and foreign investment. This feature grew from delegates' experiences in the 1930s when excessively volatile exchange rates and the reactive protectionist exchange controls that followed proved destructive to trade and prolonged the deflationary effects of the Great Depression. Capital mobility faced de facto limits under the system as governments instituted restrictions on capital flows and aligned their monetary policy to support their pegs. An important component of the Bretton Woods agreements was the creation of two new international financial institutions, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). Collectively referred to as the Bretton Woods institutions, they became operational in 1947 and 1946 respectively. The IMF was established to support the monetary system by facilitating cooperation on international monetary issues, providing advisory and technical assistance to members, and offering emergency lending to nations experiencing repeated difficulties restoring the balance of payments equilibrium. Members would contribute funds to a pool according to their share of gross world product, from which emergency loans could be issued. Member states were authorized and encouraged to employ capital controls as necessary to manage payments imbalances and meet pegging targets, but prohibited from relying on IMF financing to cover particularly short-term capital hemorrhages. While the IMF was instituted to guide members and provide a short-term financing window for recurrent balance of payments deficits, the IBRD was established to serve as a type of financial intermediary for channeling global capital toward long-term investment opportunities and postwar reconstruction projects. The creation of these organizations was a crucial milestone in the evolution of the international financial architecture, and some economists consider it the most significant achievement of multilateral cooperation following World War II. Since the establishment of the International Development Association (IDA) in 1960, the IBRD and IDA are together known as the World Bank. While the IBRD lends to middle-income developing countries, the IDA extends the Bank's lending program by offering concessional loans and grants to the world's poorest nations. General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade: 1947 In 1947, 23 countries concluded the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) at a UN conference in Geneva. Delegates intended the agreement to suffice while member states would negotiate creation of a UN body to be known as the International Trade Organization (ITO). As the ITO never became ratified, GATT became the de facto framework for later multilateral trade negotiations. Members emphasized trade reprocity as an approach to lowering barriers in pursuit of mutual gains. The agreement's structure enabled its signatories to codify and enforce regulations for trading of goods and services. GATT was centered on two precepts: trade relations needed to be equitable and nondiscriminatory, and subsidizing non-agricultural exports needed to be prohibited. As such, the agreement's most favored nation clause prohibited members from offering preferential tariff rates to any nation that it would not otherwise offer to fellow GATT members. In the event of any discovery of non-agricultural subsidies, members were authorized to offset such policies by enacting countervailing tariffs. The agreement provided governments with a transparent structure for managing trade relations and avoiding protectionist pressures. However, GATT's principles did not extend to financial activity, consistent with the era's rigid discouragement of capital movements. The agreement's initial round achieved only limited success in reducing tariffs. While the U.S. reduced its tariffs by one third, other signatories offered much smaller trade concessions. =Resurgence of financial globalization= Flexible exchange rate regimes: 1973-present World reserves of foreign exchange and gold in billions of U.S. dollars in 2009. Although the exchange rate stability sustained by the Bretton Woods system facilitated expanding international trade, this early success masked its underlying design flaw, wherein there existed no mechanism for increasing the supply of international reserves to support continued growth in trade. The system began experiencing insurmountable market pressures and deteriorating cohesion among its key participants in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Central banks needed more U.S. dollars to hold as reserves, but were unable to expand their money supplies if doing so meant exceeding their dollar reserves and threatening their exchange rate pegs. To accommodate these needs, the Bretton Woods system depended on the United States to run dollar deficits. As a consequence, the dollar's value began exceeding its gold backing. During the early 1960s, investors could sell gold for a greater dollar exchange rate in London than in the United States, signaling to market participants that the dollar was overvalued. Belgian- American economist Robert Triffin defined this problem now known as the Triffin dilemma, in which a country's national economic interests conflict with its international objectives as the custodian of the world's reserve currency. France voiced concerns over the artificially low price of gold in 1968 and called for returns to the former gold standard. Meanwhile, excess dollars flowed into international markets as the United States expanded its money supply to accommodate the costs of its military campaign in the Vietnam War. Its gold reserves were assaulted by speculative investors following its first current account deficit since the 19th century. In August 1971, President Richard Nixon suspended the exchange of U.S. dollars for gold as part of the Nixon Shock. The closure of the gold window effectively shifted the adjustment burdens of a devalued dollar to other nations. Speculative traders chased other currencies and began selling dollars in anticipation of these currencies being revalued against the dollar. These influxes of capital presented difficulties to foreign central banks, which then faced choosing among inflationary money supplies, largely ineffective capital controls, or floating exchange rates. Following these woes surrounding the U.S. dollar, the dollar price of gold was raised to $38 USD per ounce and the Bretton Woods system was modified to allow fluctuations within an augmented band of 2.25% as part of the Smithsonian Agreement signed by the G-10 members in December 1971. The agreement delayed the system's demise for a further two years. The system's erosion was expedited not only by the dollar devaluations that occurred, but also by the oil crises of the 1970s which emphasized the importance of international financial markets in petrodollar recycling and balance of payments financing. Once the world's reserve currency began to float, other nations began adopting floating exchange rate regimes. =The post-Bretton Woods financial order: 1976= Headquarters of the International Monetary Fund in Washington, D.C. As part of the first amendment to its articles of agreement in 1969, the IMF developed a new reserve instrument called special drawing rights (SDRs), which could be held by central banks and exchanged among themselves and the Fund as an alternative to gold. SDRs entered service in 1970 originally as units of a market basket of sixteen major vehicle currencies of countries whose share of total world exports exceeded 1%. The basket's composition changed over time and presently consists of the U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen, Chinese yuan, and British pound. Beyond holding them as reserves, nations can denominate transactions among themselves and the Fund in SDRs, although the instrument is not a vehicle for trade. In international transactions, the currency basket's portfolio characteristic affords greater stability against the uncertainties inherent with free floating exchange rates. Special drawing rights were originally equivalent to a specified amount of gold, but were not directly redeemable for gold and instead served as a surrogate in obtaining other currencies that could be exchanged for gold. The Fund initially issued 9.5 billion XDR from 1970 to 1972. IMF members signed the Jamaica Agreement in January 1976, which ratified the end of the Bretton Woods system and reoriented the Fund's role in supporting the international monetary system. The agreement officially embraced the flexible exchange rate regimes that emerged after the failure of the Smithsonian Agreement measures. In tandem with floating exchange rates, the agreement endorsed central bank interventions aimed at clearing excessive volatility. The agreement retroactively formalized the abandonment of gold as a reserve instrument and the Fund subsequently demonetized its gold reserves, returning gold to members or selling it to provide poorer nations with relief funding. Developing countries and countries not endowed with oil export resources enjoyed greater access to IMF lending programs as a result. The Fund continued assisting nations experiencing balance of payments deficits and currency crises, but began imposing conditionality on its funding that required countries to adopt policies aimed at reducing deficits through spending cuts and tax increases, reducing protective trade barriers, and contractionary monetary policy. The second amendment to the articles of agreement was signed in 1978. It legally formalized the free-floating acceptance and gold demonetization achieved by the Jamaica Agreement, and required members to support stable exchange rates through macroeconomic policy. The post-Bretton Woods system was decentralized in that member states retained autonomy in selecting an exchange rate regime. The amendment also expanded the institution's capacity for oversight and charged members with supporting monetary sustainability by cooperating with the Fund on regime implementation. This role is called IMF surveillance and is recognized as a pivotal point in the evolution of the Fund's mandate, which was extended beyond balance of payments issues to broader concern with internal and external stresses on countries' overall economic policies. Under the dominance of flexible exchange rate regimes, the foreign exchange markets became significantly more volatile. In 1980, newly elected U.S. President Ronald Reagan's administration brought about increasing balance of payments deficits and budget deficits. To finance these deficits, the United States offered artificially high real interest rates to attract large inflows of foreign capital. As foreign investors' demand for U.S. dollars grew, the dollar's value appreciated substantially until reaching its peak in February 1985. The U.S. trade deficit grew to $160 billion in 1985 ($341 billion in 2012 dollars) as a result of the dollar's strong appreciation. The G5 met in September 1985 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City and agreed that the dollar should depreciate against the major currencies to resolve the United States' trade deficit and pledged to support this goal with concerted foreign exchange market interventions, in what became known as the Plaza Accord. The U.S. dollar continued to depreciate, but industrialized nations became increasingly concerned that it would decline too heavily and that exchange rate volatility would increase. To address these concerns, the G7 (now G8) held a summit in Paris in 1987, where they agreed to pursue improved exchange rate stability and better coordinate their macroeconomic policies, in what became known as the Louvre Accord. This accord became the provenance of the managed float regime by which central banks jointly intervene to resolve under- and overvaluations in the foreign exchange market to stabilize otherwise freely floating currencies. Exchange rates stabilized following the embrace of managed floating during the 1990s, with a strong U.S. economic performance from 1997 to 2000 during the Dot-com bubble. After the 2000 stock market correction of the Dot-com bubble the country's trade deficit grew, the September 11 attacks increased political uncertainties, and the dollar began to depreciate in 2001. =European Monetary System: 1979= Following the Smithsonian Agreement, member states of the European Economic Community adopted a narrower currency band of 1.125% for exchange rates among their own currencies, creating a smaller scale fixed exchange rate system known as the snake in the tunnel. The snake proved unsustainable as it did not compel EEC countries to coordinate macroeconomic policies. In 1979, the European Monetary System (EMS) phased out the currency snake. The EMS featured two key components: the European Currency Unit (ECU), an artificial weighted average market basket of European Union members' currencies, and the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), a procedure for managing exchange rate fluctuations in keeping with a calculated parity grid of currencies' par values. The parity grid was derived from parities each participating country established for its currency with all other currencies in the system, denominated in terms of ECUs. The weights within the ECU changed in response to variances in the values of each currency in its basket. Under the ERM, if an exchange rate reached its upper or lower limit (within a 2.25% band), both nations in that currency pair were obligated to intervene collectively in the foreign exchange market and buy or sell the under- or overvalued currency as necessary to return the exchange rate to its par value according to the parity matrix. The requirement of cooperative market intervention marked a key difference from the Bretton Woods system. Similarly to Bretton Woods however, EMS members could impose capital controls and other monetary policy shifts on countries responsible for exchange rates approaching their bounds, as identified by a divergence indicator which measured deviations from the ECU's value. The central exchange rates of the parity grid could be adjusted in exceptional circumstances, and were modified every eight months on average during the systems' initial four years of operation. During its twenty-year lifespan, these central rates were adjusted over 50 times. Birth of the World Trade Organization: 1994 WTO Fourth Global Review of Aid for Trade: \\"Connecting to value chains\\" - 8‚Äì10 July 2013. The Uruguay Round of GATT multilateral trade negotiations took place from 1986 to 1994, with 123 nations becoming party to agreements achieved throughout the negotiations. Among the achievements were trade liberalization in agricultural goods and textiles, the General Agreement on Trade in Services, and agreements on intellectual property rights issues. The key manifestation of this round was the Marrakech Agreement signed in April 1994, which established the World Trade Organization (WTO). The WTO is a chartered multilateral trade organization, charged with continuing the GATT mandate to promote trade, govern trade relations, and prevent damaging trade practices or policies. It became operational in January 1995. Compared with its GATT secretariat predecessor, the WTO features an improved mechanism for settling trade disputes since the organization is membership-based and not dependent on consensus as in traditional trade negotiations. This function was designed to address prior weaknesses, whereby parties in dispute would invoke delays, obstruct negotiations, or fall back on weak enforcement. In 1997, WTO members reached an agreement which committed to softer restrictions on commercial financial services, including banking services, securities trading, and insurance services. These commitments entered into force in March 1999, consisting of 70 governments accounting for approximately 95% of worldwide financial services. =Financial integration and systemic crises: 1980-present= Number of countries experiencing a banking crisis in each year since 1800. This covers 70 countries. The dramatic feature of this graph is the virtual absence of banking crises during the period of the Bretton Woods system, 1945 to 1971. This analysis is similar to Figure 10.1 in Rogoff and Reinhart (2009) Financial integration among industrialized nations grew substantially during the 1980s and 1990s, as did liberalization of their capital accounts. Integration among financial markets and banks rendered benefits such as greater productivity and the broad sharing of risk in the macroeconomy. The resulting interdependence also carried a substantive cost in terms of shared vulnerabilities and increased exposure to systemic risks. Accompanying financial integration in recent decades was a succession of deregulation, in which countries increasingly abandoned regulations over the behavior of financial intermediaries and simplified requirements of disclosure to the public and to regulatory authorities. As economies became more open, nations became increasingly exposed to external shocks. Economists have argued greater worldwide financial integration has resulted in more volatile capital flows, thereby increasing the potential for financial market turbulence. Given greater integration among nations, a systemic crisis in one can easily infect others. The 1980s and 1990s saw a wave of currency crises and sovereign defaults, including the 1987 Black Monday stock market crashes, 1992 European Monetary System crisis, 1994 Mexican peso crisis, 1997 Asian currency crisis, 1998 Russian financial crisis, and the 1998‚Äì2002 Argentine peso crisis. These crises differed in terms of their breadth, causes, and aggravations, among which were capital flights brought about by speculative attacks on fixed exchange rate currencies perceived to be mispriced given a nation's fiscal policy, self-fulfilling speculative attacks by investors expecting other investors to follow suit given doubts about a nation's currency peg, lack of access to developed and functioning domestic capital markets in emerging market countries, and current account reversals during conditions of limited capital mobility and dysfunctional banking systems. Following research of systemic crises that plagued developing countries throughout the 1990s, economists have reached a consensus that liberalization of capital flows carries important prerequisites if these countries are to observe the benefits offered by financial globalization. Such conditions include stable macroeconomic policies, healthy fiscal policy, robust bank regulations, and strong legal protection of property rights. Economists largely favor adherence to an organized sequence of encouraging foreign direct investment, liberalizing domestic equity capital, and embracing capital outflows and short-term capital mobility only once the country has achieved functioning domestic capital markets and established a sound regulatory framework. An emerging market economy must develop a credible currency in the eyes of both domestic and international investors to realize benefits of globalization such as greater liquidity, greater savings at higher interest rates, and accelerated economic growth. If a country embraces unrestrained access to foreign capital markets without maintaining a credible currency, it becomes vulnerable to speculative capital flights and sudden stops, which carry serious economic and social costs. Countries sought to improve the sustainability and transparency of the global financial system in response to crises in the 1980s and 1990s. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision was formed in 1974 by the G-10 members' central bank governors to facilitate cooperation on the supervision and regulation of banking practices. It is headquartered at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland. The committee has held several rounds of deliberation known collectively as the Basel Accords. The first of these accords, known as Basel I, took place in 1988 and emphasized credit risk and the assessment of different asset classes. Basel I was motivated by concerns over whether large multinational banks were appropriately regulated, stemming from observations during the 1980s Latin American debt crisis. Following Basel I, the committee published recommendations on new capital requirements for banks, which the G-10 nations implemented four years later. In 1999, the G-10 established the Financial Stability Forum (reconstituted by the G-20 in 2009 as the Financial Stability Board) to facilitate cooperation among regulatory agencies and promote stability in the global financial system. The Forum was charged with developing and codifying twelve international standards and implementation thereof. The Basel II accord was set in 2004 and again emphasized capital requirements as a safeguard against systemic risk as well as the need for global consistency in banking regulations so as not to competitively disadvantage banks operating internationally. It was motivated by what were seen as inadequacies of the first accord such as insufficient public disclosure of banks' risk profiles and oversight by regulatory bodies. Members were slow to implement it, with major efforts by the European Union and United States taking place as late as 2007 and 2008. In 2010, the Basel Committee revised the capital requirements in a set of enhancements to Basel II known as Basel III, which centered on a leverage ratio requirement aimed at restricting excessive leveraging by banks. In addition to strengthening the ratio, Basel III modified the formulas used to weight risk and compute the capital thresholds necessary to mitigate the risks of bank holdings, concluding the capital threshold should be set at 7% of the value of a bank's risk-weighted assets. Birth of the European Economic and Monetary Union 1992 In February 1992, European Union countries signed the Maastricht Treaty which outlined a three-stage plan to accelerate progress toward an Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The first stage centered on liberalizing capital mobility and aligning macroeconomic policies between countries. The second stage established the European Monetary Institute which was ultimately dissolved in tandem with the establishment in 1998 of the European Central Bank (ECB) and European System of Central Banks. Key to the Maastricht Treaty was the outlining of convergence criteria that EU members would need to satisfy before being permitted to proceed. The third and final stage introduced a common currency for circulation known as the Euro, adopted by eleven of then-fifteen members of the European Union in January 1999. In doing so, they disaggregated their sovereignty in matters of monetary policy. These countries continued to circulate their national legal tenders, exchangeable for euros at fixed rates, until 2002 when the ECB began issuing official Euro coins and notes. , the EMU comprises 17 nations which have issued the Euro, and 11 non-Euro states. Global financial crisis Following the market turbulence of the 1990s financial crises and September 11 attacks on the U.S. in 2001, financial integration intensified among developed nations and emerging markets, with substantial growth in capital flows among banks and in the trading of financial derivatives and structured finance products. Worldwide international capital flows grew from $3 trillion to $11 trillion U.S. dollars from 2002 to 2007, primarily in the form of short-term money market instruments. The United States experienced growth in the size and complexity of firms engaged in a broad range of financial services across borders in the wake of the Gramm‚ÄìLeach‚ÄìBliley Act of 1999 which repealed the Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act of 1933, ending limitations on commercial banks' investment banking activity. Industrialized nations began relying more on foreign capital to finance domestic investment opportunities, resulting in unprecedented capital flows to advanced economies from developing countries, as reflected by global imbalances which grew to 6% of gross world product in 2007 from 3% in 2001. The global financial crisis precipitated in 2007 and 2008 shared some of the key features exhibited by the wave of international financial crises in the 1990s, including accelerated capital influxes, weak regulatory frameworks, relaxed monetary policies, herd behavior during investment bubbles, collapsing asset prices, and massive deleveraging. The systemic problems originated in the United States and other advanced nations. Similarly to the 1997 Asian crisis, the global crisis entailed broad lending by banks undertaking unproductive real estate investments as well as poor standards of corporate governance within financial intermediaries. Particularly in the United States, the crisis was characterized by growing securitization of non-performing assets, large fiscal deficits, and excessive financing in the housing sector. While the real estate bubble in the U.S. triggered the financial crisis, the bubble was financed by foreign capital flowing from many countries. As its contagious effects began infecting other nations, the crisis became a precursor for the global economic downturn now referred to as the Great Recession. In the wake of the crisis, total volume of world trade in goods and services fell 10% from 2008 to 2009 and did not recover until 2011, with an increased concentration in emerging market countries. The global financial crisis demonstrated the negative effects of worldwide financial integration, sparking discourse on how and whether some countries should decouple themselves from the system altogether. Eurozone crisis In 2009, a newly elected government in Greece revealed the falsification of its national budget data, and that its fiscal deficit for the year was 12.7% of GDP as opposed to the 3.7% espoused by the previous administration. This news alerted markets to the fact that Greece's deficit exceeded the eurozone's maximum of 3% outlined in the Economic and Monetary Union's Stability and Growth Pact. Investors concerned about a possible sovereign default rapidly sold Greek bonds. Given Greece's prior decision to embrace the euro as its currency, it no longer held monetary policy autonomy and could not intervene to depreciate a national currency to absorb the shock and boost competitiveness, as was the traditional solution to sudden capital flight. The crisis proved contagious when it spread to Portugal, Italy, and Spain (together with Greece these are collectively referred to as the PIGS). Ratings agencies downgraded these countries' debt instruments in 2010 which further increased the costliness of refinancing or repaying their national debts. The crisis continued to spread and soon grew into a European sovereign debt crisis which threatened economic recovery in the wake of the Great Recession. In tandem with the IMF, the European Union members assembled a ‚Ç¨750 billion bailout for Greece and other afflicted nations. Additionally, the ECB pledged to purchase bonds from troubled eurozone nations in an effort to mitigate the risk of a banking system panic. The crisis is recognized by economists as highlighting the depth of financial integration in Europe, contrasted with the lack of fiscal integration and political unification necessary to prevent or decisively respond to crises. During the initial waves of the crisis, the public speculated that the turmoil could result in a disintegration of the eurozone and an abandonment of the euro. German Federal Minister of Finance Wolfgang Sch√§uble called for the expulsion of offending countries from the eurozone. Now commonly referred to as the Eurozone crisis, it has been ongoing since 2009 and most recently began encompassing the 2012‚Äì13 Cypriot financial crisis. Implications of globalized capital =Balance of payments= The top five annual current account deficits and surpluses in billions of U.S. dollars for the year 2012 based on data from the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development. The balance of payments accounts summarize payments made to or received from foreign countries. Receipts are considered credit transactions while payments are considered debit transactions. The balance of payments is a function of three components: transactions involving export or import of goods and services form the current account, transactions involving purchase or sale of financial assets form the financial account, and transactions involving unconventional transfers of wealth form the capital account. The current account summarizes three variables: the trade balance, net factor income from abroad, and net unilateral transfers. The financial account summarizes the value of exports versus imports of assets, and the capital account summarizes the value of asset transfers received net of transfers given. The capital account also includes the official reserve account, which summarizes central banks' purchases and sales of domestic currency, foreign exchange, gold, and SDRs for purposes of maintaining or utilizing bank reserves. Because the balance of payments sums to zero, a current account surplus indicates a deficit in the asset accounts and vice versa. A current account surplus or deficit indicates the extent to which a country is relying on foreign capital to finance its consumption and investments, and whether it is living beyond its means. For example, assuming a capital account balance of zero (thus no asset transfers available for financing), a current account deficit of ¬£1 billion implies a financial account surplus (or net asset exports) of ¬£1 billion. A net exporter of financial assets is known as a borrower, exchanging future payments for current consumption. Further, a net export of financial assets indicates growth in a country's debt. From this perspective, the balance of payments links a nation's income to its spending by indicating the degree to which current account imbalances are financed with domestic or foreign financial capital, which illuminates how a nation's wealth is shaped over time. A healthy balance of payments position is important for economic growth. If countries experiencing a growth in demand have trouble sustaining a healthy balance of payments, demand can slow, leading to: unused or excess supply, discouraged foreign investment, and less attractive exports which can further reinforce a negative cycle that intensifies payments imbalances. A country's external wealth is measured by the value of its foreign assets net of its foreign liabilities. A current account surplus (and corresponding financial account deficit) indicates an increase in external wealth while a deficit indicates a decrease. Aside from current account indications of whether a country is a net buyer or net seller of assets, shifts in a nation's external wealth are influenced by capital gains and capital losses on foreign investments. Having positive external wealth means a country is a net lender (or creditor) in the world economy, while negative external wealth indicates a net borrower (or debtor). =Unique financial risks= Nations and international businesses face an array of financial risks unique to foreign investment activity. Political risk is the potential for losses from a foreign country's political instability or otherwise unfavorable developments, which manifests in different forms. Transfer risk emphasizes uncertainties surrounding a country's capital controls and balance of payments. Operational risk characterizes concerns over a country's regulatory policies and their impact on normal business operations. Control risk is born from uncertainties surrounding property and decision rights in the local operation of foreign direct investments. Credit risk implies lenders may face an absent or unfavorable regulatory framework that affords little or no legal protection of foreign investments. For example, foreign governments may commit to a sovereign default or otherwise repudiate their debt obligations to international investors without any legal consequence or recourse. Governments may decide to expropriate or nationalize foreign-held assets or enact contrived policy changes following an investor's decision to acquire assets in the host country. Country risk encompasses both political risk and credit risk, and represents the potential for unanticipated developments in a host country to threaten its capacity for debt repayment and repatriation of gains from interest and dividends. Participants =Economic actors= Each of the core economic functions, consumption, production, and investment, have become highly globalized in recent decades. While consumers increasingly import foreign goods or purchase domestic goods produced with foreign inputs, businesses continue to expand production internationally to meet an increasingly globalized consumption in the world economy. International financial integration among nations has afforded investors the opportunity to diversify their asset portfolios by investing abroad. Consumers, multinational corporations, individual and institutional investors, and financial intermediaries (such as banks) are the key economic actors within the global financial system. Central banks (such as the European Central Bank or the U.S. Federal Reserve System) undertake open market operations in their efforts to realize monetary policy goals. International financial institutions such as the Bretton Woods institutions, multilateral development banks and other development finance institutions provide emergency financing to countries in crisis, provide risk mitigation tools to prospective foreign investors, and assemble capital for development finance and poverty reduction initiatives. Trade organizations such as the World Trade Organization, Institute of International Finance, and the World Federation of Exchanges attempt to ease trade, facilitate trade disputes and address economic affairs, promote standards, and sponsor research and statistics publications. =Regulatory bodies= Explicit goals of financial regulation include countries' pursuits of financial stability and the safeguarding of unsophisticated market players from fraudulent activity, while implicit goals include offering viable and competitive financial environments to world investors. A single nation with functioning governance, financial regulations, deposit insurance, emergency financing through discount windows, standard accounting practices, and established legal and disclosure procedures, can itself develop and grow a healthy domestic financial system. In a global context however, no central political authority exists which can extend these arrangements globally. Rather, governments have cooperated to establish a host of institutions and practices that have evolved over time and are referred to collectively as the international financial architecture. Within this architecture, regulatory authorities such as national governments and intergovernmental organizations have the capacity to influence international financial markets. National governments may employ their finance ministries, treasuries, and regulatory agencies to impose tariffs and foreign capital controls or may use their central banks to execute a desired intervention in the open markets. Some degree of self-regulation occurs whereby banks and other financial institutions attempt to operate within guidelines set and published by multilateral organizations such as the International Monetary Fund or the Bank for International Settlements (particularly the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Committee on the Global Financial System). Further examples of international regulatory bodies are: the Financial Stability Board (FSB) established to coordinate information and activities among developed countries; the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) which coordinates the regulation of financial securities; the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) which promotes consistent insurance industry supervision; the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering which facilitates collaboration in battling money laundering and terrorism financing; and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) which publishes accounting and auditing standards. Public and private arrangements exist to assist and guide countries struggling with sovereign debt payments, such as the Paris Club and London Club. National securities commissions and independent financial regulators maintain oversight of their industries' foreign exchange market activities. Two examples of supranational financial regulators in Europe are the European Banking Authority (EBA) which identifies systemic risks and institutional weaknesses and may overrule national regulators, and the European Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee (ESFRC) which reviews financial regulatory issues and publishes policy recommendations. =Research organizations and other fora= Research and academic institutions, professional associations, and think-tanks aim to observe, model, understand, and publish recommendations to improve the transparency and effectiveness of the global financial system. For example, the independent non-partisan World Economic Forum facilitates the Global Agenda Council on the Global Financial System and Global Agenda Council on the International Monetary System, which report on systemic risks and assemble policy recommendations. The Global Financial Markets Association facilitates discussion of global financial issues among members of various professional associations around the world. The Group of Thirty (G30) formed in 1978 as a private, international group of consultants, researchers, and representatives committed to advancing understanding of international economics and global finance. Future of the global financial system The IMF has reported that the global financial system is on a path to improved financial stability, but faces a host of transitional challenges borne out by regional vulnerabilities and policy regimes. One challenge is managing the United States' disengagement from its accommodative monetary policy. Doing so in an elegant, orderly manner could be difficult as markets adjust to reflect investors' expectations of a new monetary regime with higher interest rates. Interest rates could rise too sharply if exacerbated by a structural decline in market liquidity from higher interest rates and greater volatility, or by structural deleveraging in short- term securities and in the shadow banking system (particularly the mortgage market and real estate investment trusts). Other central banks are contemplating ways to exit unconventional monetary policies employed in recent years. Some nations however, such as Japan, are attempting stimulus programs at larger scales to combat deflationary pressures. The Eurozone's nations implemented myriad national reforms aimed at strengthening the monetary union and alleviating stress on banks and governments. Yet some European nations such as Portugal, Italy, and Spain continue to struggle with heavily leveraged corporate sectors and fragmented financial markets in which investors face pricing inefficiency and difficulty identifying quality assets. Banks operating in such environments may need stronger provisions in place to withstand corresponding market adjustments and absorb potential losses. Emerging market economies face challenges to greater stability as bond markets indicate heightened sensitivity to monetary easing from external investors flooding into domestic markets, rendering exposure to potential capital flights brought on by heavy corporate leveraging in expansionary credit environments. Policymakers in these economies are tasked with transitioning to more sustainable and balanced financial sectors while still fostering market growth so as not to provoke investor withdrawal. The global financial crisis and Great Recession prompted renewed discourse on the architecture of the global financial system. These events called to attention financial integration, inadequacies of global governance, and the emergent systemic risks of financial globalization. Since the establishment in 1945 of a formal international monetary system with the IMF empowered as its guardian, the world has undergone extensive changes politically and economically. This has fundamentally altered the paradigm in which international financial institutions operate, increasing the complexities of the IMF and World Bank's mandates. The lack of adherence to a formal monetary system has created a void of global constraints on national macroeconomic policies and a deficit of rule-based governance of financial activities. French economist and Executive Director of the World Economic Forum's Reinventing Bretton Woods Committee, Marc Uzan, has pointed out that some radical proposals such as a \\"global central bank or a world financial authority\\" have been deemed impractical, leading to further consideration of medium-term efforts to improve transparency and disclosure, strengthen emerging market financial climates, bolster prudential regulatory environments in advanced nations, and better moderate capital account liberalization and exchange rate regime selection in emerging markets. He has also drawn attention to calls for increased participation from the private sector in the management of financial crises and the augmenting of multilateral institutions' resources. The Council on Foreign Relations' assessment of global finance notes that excessive institutions with overlapping directives and limited scopes of authority, coupled with difficulty aligning national interests with international reforms, are the two key weaknesses inhibiting global financial reform. Nations do not presently enjoy a comprehensive structure for macroeconomic policy coordination, and global savings imbalances have abounded before and after the global financial crisis to the extent that the United States' status as the steward of the world's reserve currency was called into question. Post- crisis efforts to pursue macroeconomic policies aimed at stabilizing foreign exchange markets have yet to be institutionalized. The lack of international consensus on how best to monitor and govern banking and investment activity threatens the world's ability to prevent future global financial crises. The slow and often delayed implementation of banking regulations that meet Basel III criteria means most of the standards will not take effect until 2019, rendering continued exposure of global finance to unregulated systemic risks. Despite Basel III and other efforts by the G20 to bolster the Financial Stability Board's capacity to facilitate cooperation and stabilizing regulatory changes, regulation exists predominantly at the national and regional levels. =Reform efforts= Former World Bank Chief Economist and former Chairman of the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers Joseph E. Stiglitz referred in the late 1990s to a growing consensus that something is wrong with a system having the capacity to impose high costs on a great number of people who are hardly even participants in international financial markets, neither speculating on international investments nor borrowing in foreign currencies. He argued that foreign crises have strong worldwide repercussions due in part to the phenomenon of moral hazard, particularly when many multinational firms deliberately invest in highly risky government bonds in anticipation of a national or international bailout. Although crises can be overcome by emergency financing, employing bailouts places a heavy burden on taxpayers living in the afflicted countries, and the high costs damage standards of living. Stiglitz has advocated finding means of stabilizing short-term international capital flows without adversely affecting long-term foreign direct investment which usually carries new knowledge spillover and technological advancements into economies. American economist and former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker has argued that the lack of global consensus on key issues threatens efforts to reform the global financial system. He has argued that quite possibly the most important issue is a unified approach to addressing failures of systemically important financial institutions, noting public taxpayers and government officials have grown disillusioned with deploying tax revenues to bail out creditors for the sake of stopping contagion and mitigating economic disaster. Volcker has expressed an array of potential coordinated measures: increased policy surveillance by the IMF and commitment from nations to adopt agreed-upon best practices, mandatory consultation from multilateral bodies leading to more direct policy recommendations, stricter controls on national qualification for emergency financing facilities (such as those offered by the IMF or by central banks), and improved incentive structures with financial penalties. Governor of the Bank of England and former Governor of the Bank of Canada Mark Carney has described two approaches to global financial reform: shielding financial institutions from cyclic economic effects by strengthening banks individually, and defending economic cycles from banks by improving systemic resiliency. Strengthening financial institutions necessitates stronger capital requirements and liquidity provisions, as well as better measurement and management of risks. The G-20 agreed to new standards presented by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision at its 2009 summit in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The standards included leverage ratio targets to supplement other capital adequacy requirements established by Basel II. Improving the resiliency of the global financial system requires protections that enable the system to withstand singular institutional and market failures. Carney has argued that policymakers have converged on the view that institutions must bear the burden of financial losses during future financial crises, and such occurrences should be well-defined and pre-planned. He suggested other national regulators follow Canada in establishing staged intervention procedures and require banks to commit to what he termed \\"living wills\\" which would detail plans for an orderly institutional failure. World leaders at the 2010 G-20 summit in Seoul, South Korea, endorsed the Basel III standards for banking regulation. At its 2010 summit in Seoul, South Korea, the G-20 collectively endorsed a new collection of capital adequacy and liquidity standards for banks recommended by Basel III. Andreas Dombret of the Executive Board of Deutsche Bundesbank has noted a difficulty in identifying institutions that constitute systemic importance via their size, complexity, and degree of interconnectivity within the global financial system, and that efforts should be made to identify a group of 25 to 30 indisputable globally systemic institutions. He has suggested they be held to standards higher than those mandated by Basel III, and that despite the inevitability of institutional failures, such failures should not drag with them the financial systems in which they participate. Dombret has advocated for regulatory reform that extends beyond banking regulations and has argued in favor of greater transparency through increased public disclosure and increased regulation of the shadow banking system. President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Vice Chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee William C. Dudley has argued that a global financial system regulated on a largely national basis is untenable for supporting a world economy with global financial firms. In 2011, he advocated five pathways to improving the safety and security of the global financial system: a special capital requirement for financial institutions deemed systemically important; a level playing field which discourages exploitation of disparate regulatory environments and beggar thy neighbour policies that serve \\"national constituencies at the expense of global financial stability\\"; superior cooperation among regional and national regulatory regimes with broader protocols for sharing information such as records for the trade of over-the-counter financial derivatives; improved delineation of \\"the responsibilities of the home versus the host country\\" when banks encounter trouble; and well-defined procedures for managing emergency liquidity solutions across borders including which parties are responsible for the risk, terms, and funding of such measures.

Peet joined Disney in 1937 and worked first on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) near the end of its production. Progressively, his involvement in the Disney studio's animated feature films and shorts increased, and he remained there until early in the development of The Jungle Book (1967). A row with Walt Disney over the direction of the project led to a permanent personal break. Peet's subsequent career was as a writer and illustrator of numerous children's books, including Capyboppy (1966), The Wump World (1970), The Whingdingdilly (1970), The Ant and the Elephant (1972), and Cyrus the Unsinkable Serpent (1975). Early life Bill Peet was born in Grandview, Indiana, on January 29, 1915. He developed a love of drawing at an early age and filled tablets with sketches. According to his autobiography, Peet's happiest childhood times were the years following World War 1 - years during which his father abandoned the family. During that period Peet lived with his mother and brothers on the outskirts of Indianapolis, in a household run by his maternal grandmother.Bill Peet: An Autobiography, by William Peet, 1989, Houghton Mifflin, pp. 3-4 Animals were always a love of Peet's. He and his friends traipsed through the woods looking for frogs, tadpoles, and minnows. Most of his adventures as a boy to catch animals were in the hope that he could capture them and sketch them. These years laid the groundwork for two primary themes repeated in his books: unkindness in the animal kingdom and the grim costs of human progress. \\"It has always been difficult for me to accept nature's cruel ways of keeping a balance among the animals - all the savagery and suffering,\\" he wrote about the frogs and snakes he chased in his local creek. \\"Yet nature's merciless ways were never more cruel than the slow, silent death caused by the poisonous waste spilling from pipes down into the creek... where dead fish floated belly up and a nauseating stench filled the air.\\"Bill Peet: An Autobiography, pp. 14-15 Often, instead of doing lessons, Peet drew in the margins of his textbooks‚Äîwhich were very popular for their added illustrations when he sold them back. The young Peet also snuck into greeting parties at the train station, just for the chance to see the train's mechanical workings close-up. As a teen, he tried to sketch the circus big top, but he was always in the way of the set-up crew. He memorized the scene and later reconstructed it from memory. After ten years of absence, Peet's father returned to the household and, according to Peet, brought with him conflict and strife - demanding that Peet's mother provide money to underwrite a string of failed ventures as a traveling salesman. This chapter culminated in the death of Peet's grandmother, which Peet implied was in part caused by the stress and misery his father caused. The home where the family lived was sold, and Peet's blissful young years ended.Bill Peet: An Autobiography, pp. 44-46 It was about this time Peet entered into Arsenal Technical High School. At first, he had little interest in pursuing a career as an artist. However, after failing all his classes but physical education, he followed the advice of a friend and took some art classes. Peet did extremely well and experimented with a broad range of media. He eventually received a scholarship to the John Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis, which he attended for three years. In the first class, Bill found himself very interested in a girl who sat in the front row. That girl, Margaret Brunst, became his wife in 1937. Peet took quite a few painting classes that first year, and he admitted his paintings were always somewhat macabre. \\"I seemed to be attracted to the gloomy side of things, or the sordid,\\" he wrote. \\"No vases of flowers or water lilies for me.\\" His favorite subjects were grizzled old men, ‚Äúperfected with age, like a gnarled oak tree.‚Äù Another favorite subject was the circus‚Äîbut always the assembly of the tent cities, never the show itself.Bill Peet: An Autobiography, p. 66 Disney Following college, Peet sent off some of his cartoon action sketches after hearing that the Disney Studio was hiring artists for their animated films. He was subsequently asked to come to try-outs. He trekked across the country to Los Angeles and participated in a one-month audition process; only three of fifteen survived the tryouts, and they were rewarded with work as \\"in-betweeners\\" (making up the frames between the key drawings) on the Donald Duck shorts. He found the work somewhat tedious. It was at this time Disney was working on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which Hollywood skeptics predicted would be a failure. After Snow White had become a triumphant success, Peet sent character sketches for Pinocchio to Disney's production team. Before the verdict on his designs had come back, Peet felt like he'd had enough, and he went screaming out of the studio, ‚ÄúNo more ducks!‚Äù Fortuitously, he came back the next day to pick up his jacket and found an envelope, informing him he had been promoted to the story department. Peet then officially began working as a sketch artist, putting the words of a story man into pictures on the film. Peet's first encounter with Walt Disney directly was at this time, when Disney reviewed the storyboards Peet had put together. Even though both his boards were eventually cut from the film, Peet continued to work on Pinocchio for another year and a half. After that period, Peet worked on Fantasia and Dumbo. When World War II broke out, Disney halted normal production and contributed to the war effort making propaganda films. Peet helped here as well but received his big break after the war was over. His work was so impressive to Walt that he made him a fully fledged story man who also handled the sketching end of character design. Peet started to paint again at this time, but soon found he had lost touch with the brush. Fine art had changed dramatically during the years Peet had been at Disney; abstractionism was in vogue and Peet's realistic paintings were out of date. He attempted editorial cartoons but failed there as well. Peet decided to continue working at Disney, where he developed a few short cartoons and worked on the feature films of the period. At this point, he was working very closely with Walt Disney; Peet respected Disney's creative genius but found him to be a sometimes difficult man. A large part of his autobiography is dedicated to his dealings with Disney over the years. Peet described the Disney studio as a \\"brutal\\" place, rife with rivalries and jealousy. After successes developing short stories for the company, Peet had his first book published, Hubert‚Äôs Hair-Raising Adventure. Although Walt Disney himself was not doing any animation by this time, he was in charge of the major decisions on the artistic side. He reviewed all the work and gave it the final go-ahead. As they were both strong-willed and passionately creative men, Peet and Disney quarreled frequently about parts in the films such as the dancing/romance scene in Sleeping Beauty. Peet quit working with Disney and left the company on January 29, 1964, which was his 49th birthday, following an especially heated argument with Walt on The Jungle Book. Children's books While he was still working at Disney, Peet turned his attention to writing and illustrating children's books. Peet developed many of his ideas from bedtime stories he had told his children and he wrote and illustrated several books while still at Disney. After leaving the studio in 1964, Peet turned his full attention into writing children's books. Much of the success Peet's stories have enjoyed is due to the memorable themes they contain: trying when there's not much obvious hope, not allowing taunting of others to prevent individual success, finding compromise in solutions and others. Unlike most other children's authors, Peet did not dumb down the vocabulary of his stories but included enough context to make the meaning of difficult words obvious. All of his books published by Houghton Mifflin Company remain actively in print. Death and legacy Peet died on May 11, 2002, at the age of 87.Bill Peet, Disney Artist and Children's Book Author, Dies at 87 The New York Times, May 18, 2002Bill Peet, 87; Disney Artist, Storyteller Wrote '101 ,' Children's Books Los Angeles Times, May 14, 2002 His interment was at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills). In 2015, Walt Disney Animation Studios produced a cartoon short for the 101 Dalmatians Diamond Edition Blu- ray release entitled The Further Adventures of Thunderbolt as a bonus feature, based on Peet's early drafts of the \\"Thunderbolt the Wonder Dog\\" sequence which follows the events after Thunderbolt and Dirty Dawson start fighting in the river. Justin Marks, who wrote the screenplay for Disney's 2016 live- action Jungle Book film directed by Jon Favreau, had commented that he plans to incorporate elements from Peet's rejected screenplay of the original animated classic into the former film's upcoming sequel: Filmography *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) (inbetweener) (uncredited) *Pinocchio (1940) (story adaptation) (uncredited) *Fantasia (1940) (story development) (The Pastoral Symphony segment) *Dumbo (1941) (story development) *Bambi (1942) (story development) (uncredited) *How to Play Football (1944) (story) (uncredited) *The Three Caballeros (1944) (story) (as Bill Peed) *Tiger Trouble (1945) (story) (as Bill Peed) *African Diary (1945) (story) (as Bill Peed) *Californy'er Bust (1945) (story) (as Bill Peed) *A Knight for a Day (1946) (story) (as Bill Peed) *Song of the South (1946) (cartoon story, animation planner) (as William Peed) *So Dear to My Heart (1948) (cartoon story treatment) (as William Peed) *Cinderella (1950) (story) (as William Peed) *Wonder Dog (1950) (story) (as Bill Peed) *Alice in Wonderland (1951) (story) *Lambert the Sheepish Lion (1952) (story) *Susie the Little Blue Coupe (1952) (original story, story adaptation) *The Little House (1952) (story adaptation) *Peter Pan (1953) (story) *Ben and Me (1953) (story) *The Wonderful World of Disney (1954‚Äì1970, fourteen episodes) (writer, story, cartoon story treatment) *The Truth About Mother Goose (1957) (story, lyricist) *Sleeping Beauty (1959) (additional story) *Goliath II (1960) (story) *One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961) (story, character stylist) *The Sword in the Stone (1963) (story, character design) *The Jungle Book (1967) (early story treatment) (uncredited) Bibliography * A Caldecott Honor Book and ALA Honor Book. =Fiction= *Hubert's Hair-Raising Adventure (1959) *Goliath II (1959) *Huge Harold (1961) *Smokey (1962) *The Pinkish, Purplish, Bluish Egg (1963) *Ella (1964) *Randy's Dandy Lions (1964) *Chester the Worldly Pig (1965) *Kermit the Hermit (1965) *Capyboppy (1966) *Farewell to Shady Glade (1966) *Jennifer and Josephine (1967) *Buford the Little Bighorn (1967) *Fly Homer Fly (1969) *The Wump World (1970) *The Whingdingdilly (1970) *How Droofus the Dragon Lost His Head (1971) *The Caboose Who Got Loose (1971) *The Ant and the Elephant (1972) *Countdown to Christmas (1972) *The Spooky Tail of Prewitt Peacock (1973) *Merle the High Flying Squirrel (1974) *Cyrus the Unsinkable Sea Serpent (1975) *The Gnats of Knotty Pine (1975) *Big Bad Bruce (1977) *Eli (1978) *Cowardly Clyde (1979) *Encore for Eleanor (1981) *The Luckiest One of All (1982) *No Such Things (1983) *Pamela Camel (1984) *The Kweeks of Kookatumdee (1985) *Zella, Zack, and Zodiac (1986) *Jethro and Joel Were a Troll (1987) *Cock-a-Doodle Dudley (1990) References External links * Bill Peet Website * 1915 births 2002 deaths People from Spencer County, Indiana Animators from Indiana American children's writers American children's book illustrators American storyboard artists Animation screenwriters Artists from Indiana Herron School of Art and Design alumni Walt Disney Animation Studios people Burials at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills) American male writers American male screenwriters 20th-century American writers Writers from Indiana Writers who illustrated their own writing 20th-century American male writers ","title":"Bill Peet"},{"id":"244081","text":"The praenomen (; plural: praenomina) was a personal name chosen by the parents of a Roman child. It was first bestowed on the dies lustricus (day of lustration), the eighth day after the birth of a girl, or the ninth day after the birth of a boy. The praenomen would then be formally conferred a second time when girls married, or when boys assumed the toga virilis upon reaching manhood. Although it was the oldest of the tria nomina commonly used in Roman naming conventions, by the late republic, most praenomina were so common that most people were called by their praenomina only by family or close friends. For this reason, although they continued to be used, praenomina gradually disappeared from public records during imperial times. Although both men and women received praenomina, women's praenomina were frequently ignored, and they were gradually abandoned by many Roman families, though they continued to be used in some families and in the countryside. Background The tria nomina, consisting of praenomen, nomen and cognomen, which are today regarded as a distinguishing feature of Roman culture, first developed and spread throughout Italy in pre-Roman times. Most of the people of Italy spoke languages belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European language family; the three major groups within the Italian Peninsula were the Latino-Faliscan languages, including the tribes of the Latini, or Latins, who formed the core of the early Roman populace, and their neighbors, the Falisci and Hernici; the Oscan languages, including the Sabines, who also contributed to early Roman culture, as well as the Samnites, and many other peoples of central and southern Italy; and the Umbrian languages, spoken by the Umbri of the Central Apennines, the rustic Picentes of the Adriatic coast, and the Volsci. In addition to the Italic peoples was the Etruscan civilization, whose language was unrelated to Indo-European, but who exerted a strong cultural influence throughout much of Italy, including early Rome.Oxford Classical Dictionary, 2nd Ed. (1970) The Italic nomenclature system cannot clearly be attributed to any one of these cultures, but seems to have developed simultaneously amongst each of them, perhaps due to constant contact between them. It first appears in urban centers and thence gradually spread to the countryside. In the earliest period, each person was known by a single name, or nomen. These nomina were monothematic; that is, they expressed a single concept or idea. As populations grew, many individuals might be known by the same name. Unlike the other cultures of Europe, which dealt with this problem by adopting dithematic names (names expressing two ideas), the peoples of Italy developed the first true surnames, or cognomina.Realencyclop√§die der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft At first these were generally personal names, and might refer to any number of things, including a person's occupation, town of origin, the name of his or her father, or some physical feature or characteristic. But gradually an increasing number of them became hereditary, until they could be used to distinguish whole families from one generation to another. As this happened, the word nomen came to be applied to these surnames, and the original personal name came to be called the praenomen, or \\"forename\\", as it was usually recited first. Cognomen came to refer to any other personal or hereditary surnames coming after the family name, and used to distinguish individuals or branches of large families from one another.William Smith, A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities As the tria nomina developed throughout Italy, the importance of the praenomen in everyday life declined considerably, together with the number of praenomina in common use. By the 1st century CE they were occasionally omitted from public records, and by the middle of the 4th century CE they were seldom recorded. As the Roman Empire expanded, much of the populace came from cultures with different naming conventions, and the formal structure of the tria nomina became neglected. Various names that were originally nomina or cognomina came to be treated as praenomina, and some individuals used several of them at once. However, some vestiges of the original system survived, and many of the original praenomina have continued into modern times.Dictionary of Greek & Roman Biography & MythologyT. R. S. Broughton, Magistrates of the Roman Republic (1952) Most common praenomina were regularly abbreviated in writing (in speech the full name would always be used). Although some names could be abbreviated multiple ways, the following tables include only the most usual abbreviation, if any, for each name. These abbreviations continue to be used by classical scholars. Latin praenomina Each of the Italic peoples had its own distinctive group of praenomina. A few names were shared between cultures, and the Etruscans in particular borrowed many praenomina from Latin and Oscan. It is disputed whether some of the praenomina used by the Romans themselves were of distinctly Etruscan or Oscan origin. However, these names were in general use at Rome and other Latin towns, and were used by families that were certainly of Latin origin. Thus, irrespective of their actual etymology, these names may be regarded as Latin. =Masculine names= In the early centuries of the Roman Republic, about three dozen praenomina seem to have been in general use at Rome, of which about half were common. This number gradually dwindled to about eighteen praenomina by the 1st century BCE, of which perhaps a dozen were common. * Agrippa (Agr.) * Appius (Ap.) * Aulus (A.) * Caeso (K.) * Decimus (D.) * Faustus (F.) * Gaius (C.) * Gnaeus (Cn.) * Hostus * Lucius (L.) * Mamercus (Mam.) * Manius (Íüø. or M'.) * Marcus (M.) * Mettius * Nonus * Numerius (N.) * Octavius (Oct.) * Opiter (Opet.) * Paullus * Postumus (Post.) * Proculus (Pro.) * Publius (P.) * Quintus (Q.) * Septimus * Sertor (Sert.) * Servius (Ser.) * Sextus (Sex.) * Spurius (S.) * Statius (St.) * Tiberius (Ti.) * Titus (T.) * Tullus * Vibius (V.) * Volesus (Vol.) * Vopiscus (Vop.) Notes: * Caeso is frequently (especially in older records) spelled Kaeso. The abbreviation K. was retained to distinguish the name from Gaius, abbreviated \\"C.\\" * Gaius and Gnaeus are abbreviated with C. and Cn., respectively, because the practice of abbreviating them was already established at the time the letter G, a modified C, was introduced to the Latin alphabet. Although the archaic spellings Caius and Cnaeus also appear in later records, Gaius and Gnaeus represent the actual pronunciation of these names. * Manius was originally abbreviated with an archaic five-stroke M (Íüø), borrowed from the Etruscan alphabet (from which the Latin alphabet was derived) but not otherwise used in Latin. The apostrophe is used as a substitute for this letter. * Octavius (with an i) seems to be the only form of this name found as a praenomen, although the form Octavus would be consistent with the adjective from which the name is derived. * Volero, a praenomen used by the Publilii, is believed to be a variant of Volesus. Some of the praenomina in this list are known from only a few examples. However, the overall sample from which they have been taken represents only a small fraction of the entire Roman populace. The Realencyclop√§die der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft mentions about ten thousand individuals whose praenomina are known from surviving works of history, literature, and various inscriptions. These individuals are spread over a period of over twelve centuries, with the smallest sample coming from the early Republic, when the greatest variety of praenomina was in use. During that same period, the sample consists almost entirely of Roman men belonging to the leading patrician families. Many of the names which were uncommon amongst the patricians appear to have been more widespread amongst the plebeians, and the appearance of rare names in Latin inscriptions outside of Rome suggests that many names which were uncommon at Rome were much more common in other parts of Latium. =Feminine names= In the earliest period, both men and women used praenomina. However, with the adoption of hereditary surnames, the praenomen lost much of its original importance. The number of praenomina in general use declined steadily throughout Roman history, and as most families used the same praenomina from one generation to the next, the praenomen became less useful for distinguishing between individuals. Women's praenomina gradually fell into disuse, and by the first century the majority of Roman women either did not have or did not use praenomina. A similar process occurred throughout Italy, except amongst the Etruscans, for whom feminine praenomina were the rule., Roman Female Praenomina: Studies in the Nomenclature of Roman Women (1994) The abandonment of women's praenomina over time was more the result of practical usage than a deliberate process. Because Latin names had both masculine and feminine forms, the nomen itself was sufficient to distinguish a Roman woman from her father and brothers. Roman women did not change their names when they married, so a Roman wife usually did not share her nomen with any other members of her family. Diminutives, nicknames, and personal cognomina could be used to differentiate between sisters. When there were two sisters, they were frequently referred to as Major and Minor, with these terms appearing after the nomen or cognomen; if there were more than two, the eldest might be called Maxima, and the younger sisters assigned numerical cognomina. Many of the cognomina used by women originated as praenomina, and for much of Roman history there seems to have been a fashion for \\"inverting\\" women's praenomina and cognomina; names that were traditionally regarded as praenomina were often placed after a woman's nomen or cognomen, as if a surname, even though they were used as praenomina. The reverse was also common, especially in imperial times; a personal cognomen would be placed before a woman's nomen, in the place of a praenomen. In both cases, the name was functionally a praenomen, irrespective of its position in the name. For this reason, it is often impossible to distinguish between women's praenomina and personal cognomina. In imperial times, Roman women were more likely to have praenomina if they had several older sisters. A daughter who had been called simply by her nomen for several years was less likely to receive a praenomen than her younger sisters, and because it was usually easy to distinguish between two daughters without using praenomina, the need for traditional personal names did not become acute until there were at least three sisters in a family. Tertia and Quarta were common praenomina, while Secunda was less common, and Prima rarer still. Maxima, Maio, and Mino were also used as praenomina, although it may be debated whether they represent true personal names. Paulla was probably given to younger daughters, and was one of the most common praenomina. Most other women's praenomina were simply the feminine forms of familiar masculine praenomina. Examples are known of all common praenomina, as well as a number of less-common ones. Only in the case of praenomina which had irregular masculine forms is there some uncertainty; but these probably became feminine by taking diminutive forms. Caesula or Caesilla appears to have been the feminine form of Caeso, and the personal cognomen Agrippina probably represents the feminine form of Agrippa. Two notable exceptions to the usual formation are Marcia and Titia, both of which regularly formed as \\"i-stem\\" nouns, instead of the expected Marca and Tita (although those forms are also found). Feminine praenomina were usually abbreviated in the same manner as their masculine counterparts, but were often written in full. One notable exception occurs in the filiations of liberti, where the abbreviation \\"C.\\" for Gaia was frequently reversed to indicate the freedman of a woman. Here the name \\"Gaia\\" seems to have been used generically to represent any woman, although in some instances an inverted \\"M.\\" for Marcia seems to have been used as well. The following list includes feminine praenomina which are known or reasonably certain from extant sources and inscriptions, and which were clearly used as praenomina, rather than nicknames or inverted cognomina. Several variations are known for some praenomina, of which only the most regular are given in this table. The abbreviations are usually the same as for the corresponding masculine praenomina; where variation exists, only the most common abbreviation has been provided. A few of these names were normally written in full, or have not been found with regular abbreviations. * Appia (Ap.) * Aula (A.) * Caesula * Decima (D.) * Fausta (F.) * Gaia (C.) * Gnaea (Cn.) * Hosta (H.) * Lucia (L.) * Maio (Mai.) * Mamerca (Mam.) * Mania (M'.) * Marcia (M.) * Maxima * Mettia * Mino (Min.) * Nona * Numeria (N.) * Octavia (Oct.) * Paulla * Postuma (Post.) * Prima * Procula (Pro.) * Publia (P.) * Quarta * Quinta (Q.) * Secunda (Seq.) * Septima * Servia (Ser.) * Sexta (Sex.) * Spuria (Sp.) * Statia (St.) * Tertia * Titia (T.) * Tiberia (Ti.) * Tulla * Vibia (V.) * Volusa (Vol.) * Vopisca (Vop.) Notes: * Maio and Mino are the forms usually found as praenomina, although Major and Minor are also found. As cognomina, Major and Minor seem to have been preferred. * Secunda was usually abbreviated Seq., although Sec. is also common. In archaic Latin, C was used primarily before E and I, while Q appeared before O and U, and K before A. In a few instances the name is written Sequnda. = The meaning of praenomina = Philologists have debated the origin and meaning of these names since classical antiquity. However, many of the meanings popularly assigned to various praenomina appear to have been no more than \\"folk etymology\\". The names derived from numbers are the most certain. The masculine names Quintus, Sextus, Septimus, Octavius and Decimus, and the feminine names Prima, Secunda, Tertia, Quarta, Quinta, Sexta, Septima, Octavia, Nona and Decima are all based on ordinal numbers. There may also have been a praenomen Nonus, as there was a gens with the apparently patronymic name of Nonius, although no examples of its use as a praenomen have survived. It is generally held that these names originally referred to the order of a child's birth, although some scholars believe that they might also have referred to the month of the Roman calendar in which a child was born. Like the masculine praenomina, the months of the old Roman Calendar had names based on the numbers five through ten: Quintilis (July), Sextilis (August), September, October, November, and December. However, this hypothesis does not account for the feminine praenomina Prima, Secunda, Tertia, and Quarta, nor does it explain why Septimus, Octavius, and perhaps Nonus were rarely used. Several other praenomina were believed to refer to the circumstances of a child's birth; for instance, Agrippa was said to refer to a child who was born feet-first; Caeso to a child born by the operation known today as a Caesarean section; Lucius to one born at dawn; Manius to one born in the morning; Numerius to one born easily; Opiter to one whose father had died, leaving his grandfather as head of the family; Postumus to a last-born child (whether or not the father was dead); Proculus to one whose father was far away; Vopiscus to the survivor of twins, the other of whom was born dead. Most of these are not based on credible etymology, although the meanings assigned to Lucius, Manius, and Postumus are probably reasonable. Amongst other credible meanings assigned to praenomina, Faustus certainly means \\"fortunate\\" in Latin; Gaius is thought to derive from the same root as gaudere, \\"to rejoice\\"; Gnaeus refers to a birthmark; Marcus and Mamercus refer to the gods Mars and Mamers (perhaps an Oscan manifestation of Mars); Paullus means \\"small\\"; Servius appears to be derived from the same root as servare, to save or \\"to keep safe\\"; Volusus (also found as Volesus and Volero) seems to come from valere, \\"to be strong\\". One popular etymology that is certainly not correct belongs to Spurius, a praenomen that was amongst the most common, and favored by many leading patrician and plebeian families during the early Republic. It was later said that it was a contraction of the phrase, sine pater filius, \\"son without a father\\", and thus used for children born out of wedlock. This belief may have led to the gradual disappearance of the name during the 1st century AD. Appius is sometimes said to be of Oscan origin, since it is known chiefly from the descendants of Appius Claudius, a Sabine from the town of Cures, who came to Rome in the early years of the Republic, and was admitted to the Patriciate. His original name was said to be Attius Clausus, which he then Romanized. However, the praenomen Appius is known from other Latin sources, and may simply represent the Latin name closest in sound to Attius. Aulus, Publius, Spurius, and Tiberius are sometimes attributed to Etruscan, in which language they are all common, although these names were also typical of praenomina used in families of indisputably Latin origin, such as the Postumii or the Cornelii. In this instance, it cannot be determined with any certainty whether these were Latin names which were borrowed by the Etruscans, or vice versa. The best case may be for Tiberius being an Etruscan name, since that praenomen was always connected with the sacred river on the boundary of Etruria and Latium, and the Etruscan name for the Tiber was Thebris. However, it still may be that the Romans knew the river by this name when the praenomen came into existence.Jacques Heurgon, Daily Life of the Etruscans (1964) = Historical trends = Many families, particularly amongst the great patrician houses, limited themselves to a small number of praenomina, probably as a means of distinguishing themselves from one another and from the plebeians, who used a wider variety of names. For example, the Cornelii used Aulus, Gnaeus, Lucius, Marcus, Publius, Servius, and Tiberius; the Julii limited themselves to Lucius, Gaius, Sextus, and Vopiscus; the Claudii were fond of Appius, Gaius, and Publius; the Postumii favored Aulus, Gaius, Lucius, Publius, and Spurius; and so on. The most prominent plebeian families also tended to limit the names of which they made regular use, although amongst both social classes, there must have been exceptions whenever a family had a large number of sons. Many families avoided certain names, although the reasons varied. According to legend, the Junii avoided the names Titus and Tiberius because they were the names of two sons of Lucius Junius Brutus, the founder of the Republic, who were executed on the grounds that they had plotted to restore the king to power. Another legend relates that after Marcus Manlius Capitolinus was condemned for treason, the Roman Senate decreed that no member of gens Manlia should bear the praenomen Marcus, a tradition that seems to have been followed until the 1st century A.D. However, normally such matters were left to the discretion of the family. In most instances, the reason why certain praenomina were preferred and others avoided probably arose from the desire to pass on family names. Several names were used by only a few patrician families, although they were more widespread amongst the plebeians. For example: Appius was used only by the Claudii, Caeso by the Fabii and the Quinctii, Agrippa by the Furii and the Menenii, Numerius by the Fabii, Mamercus by the Aemilii and the Pinarii, Vopiscus only by the Julii, and Decimus was not used by any patrician family (unless the Junii were, as is sometimes believed, originally patrician), although it was widely used amongst the plebeians. Throughout Roman history, the most common praenomen was Lucius, followed by Gaius, with Marcus in third place. During the most conservative periods, these three names could account for as much as fifty percent of the adult male population. At some distance were Publius and Quintus, only about half as common as Lucius, distantly followed by Titus. Aulus, Gnaeus, Spurius, Sextus, and Servius were less common, followed by Manius, Tiberius, Caeso, Numerius, and Decimus, which were decidedly uncommon (at least amongst the patricians) during the Republic. Throughout Republican times, the number of praenomina in general use declined, but older names were occasionally revived by noble families, and occasionally anomalous names such as Ancus, Iulus, or Kanus were given. Some of these may have been ancient praenomina that had already passed out of common use by the early Republic. As they vanished from use as personal names, many older praenomina, such as Agrippa, Faustus, Mamercus, Paullus, Postumus, Proculus, and Vopiscus were revived as cognomina. Other examples of names that may once have been praenomina include Fusus, an early cognomen of gens Furia, and Cossus, a cognomen of gens Cornelia. By the 1st century B.C., the praenomina remaining in general use at Rome were: Appius, Aulus, Caeso, Decimus, Gaius, Gnaeus, Lucius, Mamercus, Manius, Marcus, Numerius, Publius, Quintus, Servius, Sextus, Spurius, Titus, and Tiberius. However, older names continued to be revived from time to time, especially in noble families, and they probably continued to be used outside Rome. By the 2nd century A.D., several of these names had also passed out of general use at Rome, leaving Aulus, Decimus, Gaius, Gnaeus, Lucius, Manius, Marcus, Numerius, Publius, Quintus, Sextus, Titus, and Tiberius. Under the empire, confusion seems to have developed as to precisely what constituted a praenomen and how it should be used. A number of emperors considered Imperator as a praenomen, and thus part of their names. As a larger percentage of the Roman populace came from backgrounds that had never used traditional Roman names, the praenomen was frequently omitted, or at least ignored. In its place, an increasing number of magistrates and officials placed common nomina, frequently with praenomen-like abbreviations. The most common of these were Flavius (Fl.), Claudius (Cl.), Julius, Junius, Valerius (Val.), and Aurelius. These names appear almost arbitrarily, much like praenomina, and probably were intended to imply nobility, although ultimately they became so common as to lose any real significance.  Oscan and Umbrian praenomina  Many Oscan praenomina appear throughout Roman history, as the Romans encountered both friendly and hostile tribes, and slowly absorbed the peoples of Italy into their sphere of influence. Umbrian praenomina are less well-known, but appear to have been similar to those of the Oscans. Although it is widely believed that the Latin praenomen Mamercus was of Oscan origin, since Mamers was a Sabine form of Mars, it is not clear to what extent the two cultures (which sprang from the same origin) borrowed praenomina from one another, and to what extent they shared names based on roots common to each language. It is impossible to provide a complete list of Oscan praenomina, but these names are clearly identifiable in extant histories and inscriptions. Abbreviations do exist for some of them, but they were less regular, and less regularly employed, than the Latin abbreviations. * Ancus * Attius * Decius * Herius * Marius * Mettius * Minatus * Minius * Nerius * Novius * Numa * Numerius * Ovius * Paccius * Pompo * Salvius * Seppius * Statius * Taurus * Trebius * Vibius * Vettius Notes: * The -ius ending found in Latin sources is frequently found as -is or -iis in Oscan inscriptions. * Ancus is known from only two sources: Ancus Marcius, the third King of Rome, who was of Sabine ancestry, and Ancus Publicius, an early member of a plebeian gens. * Attius may be the Oscan equivalent of the Latin praenomen Appius, since the Sabine Attius Clausus took the name Appius Claudius upon settling at Rome; however, it could also simply have been the closest praenomen in sound. * Decius, Pompo (and variations thereof), and Seppius are the Oscan equivalents of the Latin praenomina Decimus, Quintus, and Septimus. A 'P' in Oscan frequently corresponded to a 'Q' in Latin. * Nerius, or Nero, a praenomen common to Oscan and Umbrian, was said to mean fortis ac strenuus, that is, \\"strong\\" or \\"vigorous\\".  Etruscan praenomina  The Etruscan language was unrelated to the other languages spoken in Italy, and accordingly it contains many names which have no equivalents in the Latin or Oscan languages. The Etruscan civilization, the most advanced of its time in that region, was a strong influence on the other peoples of Italy. The Etruscan alphabet (itself based on an early version of the Western or \\"Red\\" Greek alphabet) was the source for later Italian alphabets, including the modern Latin alphabet. However, the cultural interchange was not all one-way. With respect to personal names, the Etruscans borrowed a large number of praenomina from Latin and Oscan, adding them to their own unique names. The Etruscan language is still imperfectly known, and the number of inscriptions are limited, so this list of Etruscan praenomina encompasses what has been discovered to this point. Included are names that are certainly praenomina, no matter their linguistic origin. Names that might be nomina or cognomina have not been included. =Masculine names= * Arruns (Ar.) * Aule (A.) * Cae (C.) * Caeles * Cneve (Cn.) * Karcuna * Lar * Larce * Laris (Lr.) * Larth (La., Lth.) * Lucie (L.) * Mamarce (Mam.) * Marce (M.) * Metie * Pavle * Puplie (P.) * Sethre (Se.) * Spurie (S.) * Thefarie * Tite (T.) * Uchtave * Vel (Vl.) * Velthur (Vth.) * Vipie (V.)

There is no agreement on whether any of these were borrowed from Etruscan, or whether all were originally Latin. * The Etruscans used a number of diminutives for both masculine and feminine names, including the masculine names Arnza (from Arruns), Venel, and Venox (from Vel). =Feminine names= * Fasti (F.) * Hasti (H.) * Larthi * Lethi * Ramtha (R.) * Ravnthu * Tanaquil (Thx.) * Thana (Th.) * Titia (T.) * Vela Notes: * Fasti may be borrowed from the Latin praenomen Fausta.

They are elected corporate bodies, have variable tax raising powers, and are responsible for areas known as civil parishes, serving in total 16 million people. A parish council may decide to call itself a Town Council (if the parish covers a town) Village Council, Community Council, Neighbourhood Council, or if the parish has city status, the parish council may call itself a City Council. However the powers and duties of the parish council are the same whatever name it carries.Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 Civil parish councils were formed in England under the reforming Local Government Act 1894 to take over local oversight of civic duties in rural towns and villages from the vestry committee. Parish and town councils vary enormously in size, activities and circumstances, representing populations ranging from less than 100 (small rural hamlets) to up to 100,000 (Sutton Coldfield Town Council). Most of them are small: around 80% represent populations of less than 2,500 ; and two thirds spend under ¬£25,000 per year. Overview Map of English parishes and Welsh communities There are 9,000 parish and town councils in England. Over 16 million people live in communities served by these local councils, which is around 25% of the population, and about 80,000 councillors serve on these councils. It is calculated ¬£1 billion is invested in these communities every year. Their activities fall into three main categories: representing the local community, delivering services to meet local needs, and improving quality of life and community well being.NALC Website October 2014 Not every civil parish has a parish council: smaller ones‚Äîtypically those with an electorate of fewer than 200‚Äîhave parish meetings instead. A parish with a small number of electors may share a council with one or more neighbouring parishes; such an arrangement is known as a grouped parish council, or sometimes as a joint parish council, common parish council or combined parish council. Parish councils are funded by levying a \\"precept\\" collected from within the council tax paid by the residents of the parish. Parish councils are made up of unpaid councillors who are elected to serve for four years. A casual vacancy may be filled by by- election or co-option. Powers and duties A parish office, Sawtry.

Parish councils have the power to tax their residents to support their operations and to carry out local projects. Although there is no limit to the amount that can be raised, the money can only be raised for a limited number of purposes, defined in the 1894 Act and subsequent legislation. The \\"General Power of Competence\\" is a power awarded in 2012 to eligible councils. There are large variations in the size, resources and abilities of parish councils, and a correspondingly large variation in the services they provide, as such there are only a limited number of duties which they are legally obliged to fulfil, but a more extensive range of powers which they can exercise at their discretion. =Duty to provide facilities= * Allotments - Duty to consider providing allotment gardens if demand unsatisfied.Smallholdings & Allotments Act 1908, s.23 =Powers to provide facilities= Parish councils have powers to provide, maintain and manage some facilities themselves, or they can contribute towards their provision by others. There are large variations in the facilities provided by parishes, but they can include the following: * Community buildings, such as village halls, town halls, or community centres * Recreational facilities such as recreation grounds, parks, children's play areas, playing fields, and swimming baths * Conference facilities * Cemeteries and crematoria * Maintenance of closed churchyards * Litter bins * Public seats * Public toilets * Public clocks * Cycle and motorcycle parking * Maintenance of rights of way * Guardianship of common land (such as village greens) * Maintenance of war memorials They may also provide the following, subject to the consent of the county council or unitary authority of the area in which they lie: *Bus shelters *Lighting of roads and public places *Off- street car parks *Certain traffic signs and other public notices *Provision, maintenance and protection of roadside verges *Establishment or acquisition of markets, and provision of market places and market buildings =Consultative powers= Parish councils have the right to be consulted by the district, county council or unitary authority on: * All planning applications in their areas * Intention to provide a burial ground in the parish * Proposals to carry out sewerage works * Footpath and bridleway (more generally, 'rights of way') surveys * Intention to make byelaws in relation to hackney carriages, music and dancing, promenades, sea shore and street naming * The appointment of governors of primary schools =Miscellaneous powers= Parish councils may also exercise the following powers: * Sponsoring public events * Support of the arts and provision of entertainment * Encouragement of tourism * Providing grants to local voluntary organisations * Funding crime prevention measures * Funding community transport schemes * Contribution of money towards traffic calming schemes * Cleaning and drainage of ponds, watercourses and ditches * Power to obtain water from any well, spring or stream * Creation of a neighbourhood plan * Power to acquire or dispose of land * Withholding of consent to stop up unclassified highways and footpaths * Appointing trustees of local charities * Power to make byelaws in regard to pleasure grounds, cycle parks, baths and washhouses, open spaces and burial grounds, and mortuaries and post-mortem rooms. =General power of competence= Under the Localism Act 2011 eligible parish councils can be granted a \\"general power of competence\\" (GPC) which allows them within certain limits the freedom to do anything an individual can do provided it is not prohibited by other legislation, as opposed to being limited to the powers explicitly granted to them by law. To be eligible for this a parish council must meet certain conditions, such as at least two-thirds of the councillors being elected as opposed to being co-opted or appointed, and having a clerk with suitable qualifications. In principle the GPC can allow councils to engage in a range of activities such as setting up a trading company or co-operative to lend or invest money, run a local shop, post office or energy company. Or allow it to contribute towards the provision of a service by another authority. Meetings A typical parish notice board, which is the usual \\"noticeable place\\" where official notices are posted. The historic council chamber, Much Wenlock, dating from 1577 and still in use today by the town council The central function of the Council, the making of local decisions and policy relevant to the public interest of the parish, is performed at the meetings of the Council. A Parish Council must hold an annual meeting and at least three other meetings in a year; however monthly meetings are the most common, and some larger councils have fortnightly meetings. An extraordinary meeting may be called at any time by the chairman or members, but due notice must be given. A Council can form committees with delegated powers for specific purposes; however these must adhere to the protocols for public attendance, minute-taking and notice of meetings that apply to the main Council. A committee may form sub-committees. A Council can also appoint advisory groups which are exempt from these constraints to give flexibility, but these have no delegated powers and cannot make financial decisions. Such groups may contain members who are not councillors. A Parish Council consists of the chairman and not fewer than five elected Parish councillors, and a quorum of the main council committee is at least one-third of the members, or three members, whichever is the greater. Every meeting is open to the public, who are encouraged to attend, except for those items where the Council formally resolves to exclude the public and press on the grounds that publicity would be prejudicial to the public interest. This would have to be due to the confidential nature of the business. This latter also applies to any sub- committee of the Parish Council. Notice of meetings must be given at least three clear days(LGA 1972 Part 2s10(2)). Legal definition of 3 clear days. The day on which the notice was issued or posted, the day of the meeting, a Sunday, a day of the Christmas break or a bank holiday or a day appointed for public thanks giving or mourning shall not count towards the 3 clear days. before and be displayed in a \\"noticeable place\\" in the Parish, giving time, date and venue. A summons to attend the meeting is also issued, specifying the agenda, to every member of the Council. Items not on the agenda cannot be formally debated or resolved. Items brought up by the attendance of the general public or in correspondence can be discussed,sect 12 Local Government Act 1972 but formal resolutions on these must be deferred to the next meeting so that due notice can be given.(Longfield Parish Council v Wright). A council must specify on such notice all items of business proposed to be transacted at the meeting; a council cannot lawfully decide any matter which is not specified in the summons (Agenda). The minutes of the meeting are taken by the clerk, and are ratified at the next meeting of the council. They must also be displayed in a noticeable place in the parish, and for many councils, they are now also displayed on the internet. Procedures for the conduct of meetings are set out in Schedule 12 of the Local Government Act 1972, and where this is not overridden by legislation, by the standing orders of the Council. Most adopt the National Association of Local Councils (NALC) model standing orders. Councillors are expected to adhere to the \\"Nolan principles\\" of conduct in public life Leopold, Patricia (2004). \\"Standards of Conduct in Public Life\\". In Jowell, Jeffrey; Oliver, Dawn. The Changing Constitution (5 ed.). Oxford University Press. . Administration The administration of the Council is managed by the Parish Clerk, who is a paid employee acting in a combined statutory role of Proper Officer (Chief Executive of The Council). They may be full-time or part-time, depending on the amount of council business, and large Parish Councils may require more than one official for these tasks, in which case they are a group led by the Clerk. The necessary financial monitoring and reporting are the clerk‚Äôs responsibility, and in this role the clerk is known as the ‚ÄúResponsible Financial Officer‚Äù (RFO) of the Council. The clerk is also the \\"Proper Officer\\" of the Council. They \\"enact\\" (cause to happen) the decisions of the Council, and they receive official correspondence and issue correspondence on the instructions of the Council. The clerk also prepares agendas for meetings of the Council and its committees, gives notice of these to the Council members and the public, and records and publishes the minutes of these meetings. They are the formal point of contact with the public, and are a source of information for the public about the Council‚Äôs activities. The clerk also provides procedural guidance for the Council itself, and ensures that statutory and other provisions governing or affecting the running of the Council are observed. Clerks are encouraged to have a formal qualification, such as the Certificate in Local Council Administration (CiLCA). The Clerk may not be a member of the Council.Governance Toolkit for Parish & Town Councils - 2009. SLCC, NALC and ACSS Elections and membership The term of office of a parish councillor is four years, and council seats are elected en bloc through First past the post system like some other UK elections by secret ballot. The legislation provides that the number of elected members of a parish council shall not be less than five. Larger parishes may be divided into parish wards, with separate elections for each ward. The timing of the election cycle is usually linked to that of the election of a district councillor for the ward containing the parish. Where the elections to a district council are delayed or cancelled (e.g due to its abolishment with the formation of a unitary council or a change from elections by thirds to the whole council), the term of a parish council may be extended to match the next elections to the new authority. A candidate must be at least one of the following: * A UK or Commonwealth citizen * Citizen of the Republic of Ireland * Citizen of another member state of the European Union and candidates must state on their consent for nomination form their qualification for election, which must be at least one of the following: * they are an elector of the parish * during the whole of the last 12 months they have occupied, either as owner or tenant, land or other premises in the parish. * their principal or only place of work is in the parish * they live within 4.8 kilometres (3 miles) of the parish boundaryParish Council elections - guidance for candidates and agents - The electoral Commission The chairman of the last council shall remain in office, even if not elected to the newly constituted council, until a new chairman is appointed at the first meeting of the new council. =Uncontested elections= Where there are an equal number or fewer candidates than there are vacancies, all candidates are elected unopposed, and no poll is taken. Where there are fewer candidates than vacant seats, the parish council has the power to coopt any person or persons to fill the vacancies. This power, however, may only be exercised if there is a quorum of councillors present and within 35 days of the election. If the parish council fails to fill the vacancies within this period, the district council may dissolve it and order fresh elections. If there is not a quorum elected the district council must dissolve it and order fresh elections. =Contested elections= Where there are more candidates than vacancies, a poll must be held. Undivided parishes, or multi-member parish wards, hold elections under the bloc vote system. =Casual vacancies= If a vacancy occurs during the term of a parish council, it may be filled by either election or co-option. Elections only occur if, following the advertisement of the vacancy for 14 days, 10 electors send a written request to the returning officer. If no request is received, the parish council will be required to fill the vacancies by co-option. If vacancy occurs within 6 months of a scheduled election, then a by-election cannot be called, but the council has the power to co-opt. The nomination qualifications required of a candidate for co-option are the same as for those for election. If the number of vacancies on the parish council is such that there is no longer a quorum, the district council may temporarily appoint persons to bring the council up to strength in the interval prior to an election. History Civil parish councils were formed in England under the reforming Local Government Act 1894 to take over local oversight of civic duties in rural towns and villages. The act created two new types of local authority, parish councils and district councils, to rationalise the large number of bodies which existed for a variety of activities such as public health, secular burials, water supply and drainage. It also finally removed secular duties from the local vestry committees and gave them to the new parish councils. An idea of the scope of this huge re-organisation can be gained from the words of H H Fowler , President of the Local Government Board, who said in the parliamentary debate for the 1894 Act: The government chose the civil parish as the basic unit of local government in rural areas. Each parish council's area of responsibility was a geographical area known as a civil parish. The civil parishes were also grouped to form rural districts, which became the geographical areas of rural district councils. Civil geographical parishes continued to exist in urban districts, but did not have parish councils. Whilst the bulk of the rationalised activities went to district councils, parish councils took over a number of lesser powers including all the secular activities of the parish Vestry committee; a system of local government based on ecclesiastical parishes that originated in the feudal system. Modern development Two principal Acts of Parliament have increased the general powers of parish councils, and removed onerous constraints. =Local Government Act 1972= The Redcliffe-Maud Report led to the Local Government Act 1972, which dramatically re-organised local government with amalgamation of district councils, large-scale changes to county boundaries and creation of metropolitan areas. However, the parish council was retained as the \\"grass roots\\" tier of local democracy for rural areas. In addition, many small towns which had previously formed municipal boroughs or urban districts became \\"successor parishes\\" within larger districts. The Act also recognised the role of parish councils in development planning in their parish, and gave them the right to be informed and consulted on applications for such development. However, the original proposal to grant a general power of competence to councils was not carried through, and the doctrine of ultra vires remained. This meant that parish councils could not do anything outside their statutory powers.Parish Government 1894-1994 KP Poole, B Keith-Lucas NALC 1994 =Localism Act 2011= It was not until the Localism Act 2011 that parish councils were freed of the constraints of ultra vires which limited the activities of parish councils to only those things for which they had been given statutory powers, and were given a radical new power: to 'do anything that individuals generally may do' as long as that is not limited by some other Act. This is known as the General Power of Competence (GPC), and is available to \\"eligible\\" parish councils. An eligible council is one which has resolved to adopt the GPC, with at least two-thirds of its members being declared elected, rather than co-opted, and the Clerk must hold an appropriate qualification.(Parish Councils (General Power of Competence) (Prescribed Conditions) Order 2012) However the precept may not be raised for purposes which rely only on the power of the GPC, and such funding must be obtained from other sources.Local Government Association - \\"The General Power of Competence - Empowering councils to make a difference\\" L13-563 Jul 2013 The Localism Act also introduced new rights and powers to allow local communities to shape new development by coming together to prepare neighbourhood plans. Neighbourhood planning can be taken forward by two types of body: town and parish councils or 'neighbourhood forums'. Neighbourhood forums are community groups that are designated to take forward neighbourhood planning in areas without parishes. It is the role of the local planning authority to agree who should be the neighbourhood forum for the neighbourhood area. Neighbourhood forums and parish councils can use new neighbourhood planning powers to establish general planning policies for the development and use of land in a neighbourhood. These are described legally as 'neighbourhood development plans'. In an important change to the planning system, communities can use neighbourhood planning to permit the development they want to see - in full or in outline ‚Äì without the need for planning applications. These are called 'neighbourhood development orders'.UK Government planning portal - \\"Neighbourhood planning\\" Alternative styles In 1974, at the same time as the creation of successor parishes, the law was changed so that any parish council could pass a resolution to declare its area a \\"town\\", with the council known as a \\"town council\\". The majority of successor parishes, and a number of other small market towns now have town councils, whose powers are exactly the same as those of parish councils, although their chairmen are entitled to style themselves as \\"town mayor\\". Similarly, a handful of parishes have been granted city status by letters patent: the council of such a parish is known as \\"city council\\" and the chairman is entitled to be known as the \\"city mayor\\". In England, there are currently eight parishes with city status, all places with long-established Anglican cathedrals: Chichester, Ely, Hereford, Lichfield, Ripon, Salisbury, Truro and Wells. Following the enactment of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007, a parish council has been able to alternatively style itself as a \\"village council\\", \\"neighbourhood council\\" or \\"community council\\". A provision of this Act is that is that civil parishes may now be established in the London boroughs.Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 Creation, alteration and abolition of councils Since the enactment of the Local Government and Rating Act 1997, district and unitary councils may create a parish council for a new civil parish either through a review or in response to a petition. This has led to the creation of new parish councils at an increased rate, especially in large towns and cities which do not have a history of parish governance. Since 13 February 2008 the power to create new parishes and parish councils, to alter parish boundaries, to dissolve parish councils and to abolish parishes has been devolved to district, unitary and London Borough councils (collectively known as \\"principal councils\\"). This process is known as a \\"community governance review\\". Principal councils have the power to make a community governance review at any time for all or part of their district. It is envisaged that such reviews will occur at intervals of between 10 and 15 years, and will take into account population changes, the need for well-defined boundaries and the wishes of local inhabitants. Reviews may also be triggered by a petition of local government electors for an area. A petition is deemed valid where it is signed by a sufficient proportion of the electorate (ranging from 50% in an area with fewer than 500 electors to 10% in one with more than 2,500). The sufficient proportion of the electorate necessary in areas with more than 2,500 electors was reduced from 10% to 7.5% under an amendment to the Act made in 2015.https://www.gov.uk/government/news/making-it-easier-for-communities-to- set-up-new-town-and-parish-councils At the end of the review process, which must be completed within 12 months, the principal council is empowered to issue a reorganisation order setting out the changes. This order may: * Create a new parish ** From all or part of an unparished area ** By the division of an existing parish or parishes ** By the merger of all or parts of existing parishes * Alter the boundaries of existing parishes * Group or ungroup parishes * Give a name to a new parish * Abolish an existing parish and dissolve its parish council In order to abolish an existing parish council, the principal council must provide evidence that this in response to \\"justified, clear and sustained local support\\" from the area's inhabitants. Where a new parish is formed with 1,000 electors or more, a parish council must be formed. Where there are between 151 and 999 electors the principal council may recommend the establishment of either a parish council or parish meeting. Where there are 150 electors or fewer a parish council may not be formed. Reviews come into effect on 1 April in the year following the date the reorganisation order is made. Where a new parish council is created, elections to the new body will be held at the time of next council elections. In the intervening period the principal council appoint the parish council from among their own membership.

The first member of the gens who obtained the consulship was Servius Sulpicius Camerinus Cornutus, in 500 BC, only nine years after the expulsion of the Tarquins, and the last of the name who appears on the consular list was Sextus Sulpicius Tertullus in AD 158. Although originally patrician, the family also possessed plebeian members, some of whom may have been descended from freedmen of the gens.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 945 (\\"Sulpicia Gens\\"). Praenomina The Sulpicii made regular use of only four praenomina: Publius, Servius, Quintus, and Gaius. The only other praenomen appearing under the Republic is Marcus, known from the father of Gaius Sulpicius Peticus, five times consul during the fourth century BC. The last of the Sulpicii known to have held the consulship, in the second century AD, was named Sextus, a praenomen otherwise unknown in this gens. Branches and cognomina During the Republic, several branches of the Sulpician gens were identified by numerous cognomina, including Camerinus, Cornutus, Galba, Gallus, Longus, Paterculus, Peticus, Praetextatus, Quirinus, Rufus, and Saverrio. In addition to these cognomina, we meet with some other surnames belonging to freedmen and to other persons under the Empire. On coins we find the surnames Galba, Platorinus, Proclus, and Rufus. Camerinus was the name of an old patrician family of the Sulpicia gens, which probably derived its name from the ancient town of Cameria or Camerium, in Latium. Many of them bore the agnomen Cornutus, from a Latin adjective meaning \\"horned\\". The Camerini frequently held the highest offices in the state in the early times of the Republic; but after 345 BC, when Servius Sulpicius Camerinus Rufus was consul, we do not hear of them again for upwards of three hundred years, till Quintus Sulpicius Camerinus obtained the consulship in AD 9. The family was reckoned one of the noblest in Rome in the early times of the Empire.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, p. 590 (\\"Camerinus\\"). The Praetextati appear in the second half of the fifth century BC. The family appears to have been a small one, descended from the Camerini. It probably derived its name from one of several related meanings. Praetextus commonly referred to clothing with a decorative border, and especially to the toga praetexta, a toga with a purple border worn by boys and magistrates. Something veiled or concealed could also be described as praetextatus.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, pp. 515, 516 (\\"Praetextatus\\").Cassell's Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. \\"praetextatus\\". The Sulpicii Longi flourished during the fourth century BC, from the time of the Gallic sack of Rome in 390 to the period of the Samnite Wars. The cognomen Longus may have been bestowed upon the ancestor of this family because he was particularly tall.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, p. 806 (\\"Sulpicius Longus\\").Cassell's Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. \\"longus\\". The surname Rufus, meaning \\"red\\", probably referred to the color of the hair of one of the Sulpicii, and may have begun as a cadet branch of the Camerini, as both cognomina were united in the consul of 345 BC.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, pp. 945‚Äì947 (\\"Sulpicius Rufus\\"). Several Sulpicii bearing this surname appear towards the end of the Republic, but as some appear to have been patricians and others plebeians, they may have constituted two distinct families.Badian, \\"The Clever and the Wise\\", pp. 6‚Äì7 (and note 6).Evans, \\"Review\\", pp. 765‚Äì766. The Sulpicii Galli were a family of the second and third centuries BC. Their cognomen may refer to a cock, or to a Gaul. The greatest of this family, Gaius Sulpicius Gallus, was a successful general and statesman, as well as an orator and scholar much admired by Cicero.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, pp. 228, 229 (\\"Sulpicius Gallus\\"). The Sulpicii Galbae first came to prominence during the Second Punic War, and remained distinguished until the first century AD, when Servius Sulpicius Galba claimed the title of Emperor.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, pp. 203‚Äì207 (\\"Galba\\"). Suetonius gives four possible explanations of this surname: that the first of the family burnt a town he had besieged, using torches smeared with galbanum, a type of gum; or that, chronically ill, he made regular use of a type of remedy wrapped in wool, known as galbeum; or that galba was a Gallic word for someone very fat; or instead that he resembled a galba, a grub or caterpillar.Suetonius, \\"The Life of Galba\\", 3.

Roman gentes ","title":"Sulpicia gens"},{"id":"244097","text":"Hann window. Most popular window functions are similar bell-shaped curves. In signal processing and statistics, a window function (also known as an apodization function or tapering function) is a mathematical function that is zero-valued outside of some chosen interval, normally symmetric around the middle of the interval, usually near a maximum in the middle, and usually tapering away from the middle. Mathematically, when another function or waveform/data-sequence is \\"multiplied\\" by a window function, the product is also zero-valued outside the interval: all that is left is the part where they overlap, the \\"view through the window\\". Equivalently, and in actual practice, the segment of data within the window is first isolated, and then only that data is multiplied by the window function values. Thus, tapering, not segmentation, is the main purpose of window functions. The reasons for examining segments of a longer function include detection of transient events and time-averaging of frequency spectra. The duration of the segments is determined in each application by requirements like time and frequency resolution. But that method also changes the frequency content of the signal by an effect called spectral leakage. Window functions allow us to distribute the leakage spectrally in different ways, according to the needs of the particular application. There are many choices detailed in this article, but many of the differences are so subtle as to be insignificant in practice. In typical applications, the window functions used are non-negative, smooth, \\"bell-shaped\\" curves. Rectangle, triangle, and other functions can also be used. A rectangular window does not modify the data segment at all. It's only for modelling purposes that we say it multiplies by 1 inside the window and by 0 outside. A more general definition of window functions does not require them to be identically zero outside an interval, as long as the product of the window multiplied by its argument is square integrable, and, more specifically, that the function goes sufficiently rapidly toward zero.  Applications  Window functions are used in spectral analysis/modification/resynthesis, the design of finite impulse response filters, as well as beamforming and antenna design. = Spectral analysis = The Fourier transform of the function is zero, except at frequency ¬±œâ. However, many other functions and waveforms do not have convenient closed-form transforms. Alternatively, one might be interested in their spectral content only during a certain time period. In either case, the Fourier transform (or a similar transform) can be applied on one or more finite intervals of the waveform. In general, the transform is applied to the product of the waveform and a window function. Any window (including rectangular) affects the spectral estimate computed by this method. Figure 2: Windowing a sinusoid causes spectral leakage. The same amount of leakage occurs whether there are an integer (blue) or non-integer (red) number of cycles within the window (rows 1 and 2). When the sinusoid is sampled and windowed, its discrete-time Fourier transform also exhibits the same leakage pattern (rows 3 and 4). But when the DTFT is only sparsely sampled, at a certain interval, it is possible (depending on your point of view) to: (1) avoid the leakage, or (2) create the illusion of no leakage. For the case of the blue DTFT, those samples are the outputs of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The red DTFT has the same interval of zero-crossings, but the DFT samples fall in-between them, and the leakage is revealed.  Choice of window function  Windowing of a simple waveform like causes its Fourier transform to develop non-zero values (commonly called spectral leakage) at frequencies other than œâ. The leakage tends to be worst (highest) near œâ and least at frequencies farthest from œâ. If the waveform under analysis comprises two sinusoids of different frequencies, leakage can interfere with our ability to distinguish them spectrally. Possible types of interference are often broken down into two opposing classes as follows: If the component frequencies are dissimilar and one component is weaker, then leakage from the stronger component can obscure the weaker one's presence. But if the frequencies are too similar, leakage can render them unresolvable even when the sinusoids are of equal strength. Windows that are effective against the first type of interference, namely where components have dissimilar frequencies and amplitudes, are called high dynamic range. Conversely, windows that can distinguish components with similar frequencies and amplitudes are called high resolution. The rectangular window is an example of a window that is high resolution but low dynamic range, meaning it is good for distinguishing components of similar amplitude even when the frequencies are also close, but poor at distinguishing components of different amplitude even when the frequencies are far away. High-resolution, low-dynamic-range windows such as the rectangular window also have the property of high sensitivity, which is the ability to reveal relatively weak sinusoids in the presence of additive random noise. That is because the noise produces a stronger response with high-dynamic-range windows than with high-resolution windows. At the other extreme of the range of window types are windows with high dynamic range but low resolution and sensitivity. High-dynamic-range windows are most often justified in wideband applications, where the spectrum being analyzed is expected to contain many different components of various amplitudes. In between the extremes are moderate windows, such as Hamming and Hann. They are commonly used in narrowband applications, such as the spectrum of a telephone channel. In summary, spectral analysis involves a trade-off between resolving comparable strength components with similar frequencies (high resolution / sensitivity) and resolving disparate strength components with dissimilar frequencies (high dynamic range). That trade-off occurs when the window function is chosen.  Discrete-time signals  When the input waveform is time-sampled, instead of continuous, the analysis is usually done by applying a window function and then a discrete Fourier transform (DFT). But the DFT provides only a sparse sampling of the actual discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) spectrum. Figure 2, row 3 shows a DTFT for a rectangularly-windowed sinusoid. The actual frequency of the sinusoid is indicated as \\"13\\" on the horizontal axis. Everything else is leakage, exaggerated by the use of a logarithmic presentation. The unit of frequency is \\"DFT bins\\"; that is, the integer values on the frequency axis correspond to the frequencies sampled by the DFT. So the figure depicts a case where the actual frequency of the sinusoid coincides with a DFT sample, and the maximum value of the spectrum is accurately measured by that sample. In row 4, it misses the maximum value by ¬Ω bin, and the resultant measurement error is referred to as scalloping loss (inspired by the shape of the peak). For a known frequency, such as a musical note or a sinusoidal test signal, matching the frequency to a DFT bin can be prearranged by choices of a sampling rate and a window length that results in an integer number of cycles within the window. Figure 3: This figure compares the processing losses of three window functions for sinusoidal inputs, with both minimum and maximum scalloping loss.  Noise bandwidth  The concepts of resolution and dynamic range tend to be somewhat subjective, depending on what the user is actually trying to do. But they also tend to be highly correlated with the total leakage, which is quantifiable. It is usually expressed as an equivalent bandwidth, B. It can be thought of as redistributing the DTFT into a rectangular shape with height equal to the spectral maximum and width B. = \\\\frac{1}{H(f)^2_{\\\\max}} \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} H(f)^2 df. }} The more the leakage, the greater the bandwidth. It is sometimes called noise equivalent bandwidth or equivalent noise bandwidth, because it is proportional to the average power that will be registered by each DFT bin when the input signal contains a random noise component (or is just random noise). A graph of the power spectrum, averaged over time, typically reveals a flat noise floor, caused by this effect. The height of the noise floor is proportional to B. So two different window functions can produce different noise floors.  Processing gain and losses  In signal processing, operations are chosen to improve some aspect of quality of a signal by exploiting the differences between the signal and the corrupting influences. When the signal is a sinusoid corrupted by additive random noise, spectral analysis distributes the signal and noise components differently, often making it easier to detect the signal's presence or measure certain characteristics, such as amplitude and frequency. Effectively, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is improved by distributing the noise uniformly, while concentrating most of the sinusoid's energy around one frequency. Processing gain is a term often used to describe an SNR improvement. The processing gain of spectral analysis depends on the window function, both its noise bandwidth (B) and its potential scalloping loss. These effects partially offset, because windows with the least scalloping naturally have the most leakage. Figure 3 depicts the effects of three different window functions on the same data set, comprising two equal strength sinusoids in additive noise. The frequencies of the sinusoids are chosen such that one encounters no scalloping and the other encounters maximum scalloping. Both sinusoids suffer less SNR loss under the Hann window than under the Blackman‚ÄìHarris window. In general (as mentioned earlier), this is a deterrent to using high-dynamic-range windows in low-dynamic-range applications. Figure 4: Two different ways to generate an 8-point Gaussian window sequence (œÉ=0.4) for spectral analysis applications. MATLAB calls them \\"symmetric\\" and \\"periodic\\". The latter is also historically called DFT-even. Figure 5: Spectral leakage characteristics of the functions in Figure 4 Symmetry The formulas provided in this article produce discrete sequences, as if a continuous window function has been \\"sampled\\". (See an example at Kaiser window.) Window sequences for spectral analysis are either symmetric or 1-sample short of symmetric (called periodic, DFT-even, or DFT- symmetric). For instance, a true symmetric sequence, with its maximum at a single center-point, is generated by the MATLAB function \`hann(9,'symmetric')\`. Deleting the last sample produces a sequence identical to \`hann(8,'periodic')\`. Similarly, the sequence \`hann(8,'symmetric')\` has two equal center-points. Some functions have one or two zero-valued end-points, which are unnecessary in most applications. Deleting a zero-valued end-point has no effect on its DTFT (spectral leakage). But the function designed for +1 or +2 samples, in anticipation of deleting one or both end points, typically has a slightly narrower main lobe, slightly higher sidelobes, and a slightly smaller noise-bandwidth. =DFT-symmetry= The predecessor of the DFT is the finite Fourier transform, and window functions were \\"always an odd number of points and exhibit even symmetry about the origin\\". In that case, the DTFT is entirely real-valued. When the same sequence is shifted into a DFT data window, , the DTFT becomes complex-valued, except at frequencies spaced at regular intervals of . Thus, when sampled by an -length DFT (see periodic summation), the samples (called DFT coefficients) are still real-valued. Because of the periodic summation the last sample of the window function, , is incorporated in the term of the DFT: , which is real-valued for all values of (all DFT coefficients). So when the last sample of a symmetric sequence is truncated, it does not affect the zero-valued imaginary components. And due to its generally small value, the effect on the DTFT (spectral leakage), is usually a negligible amount (unless is small, e.g. ‚â§ 20). When windows are multiplicatively applied to actual data, the sequence usually lacks any symmetry, and the DFT is generally not real-valued. Despite this caveat, many authors reflexively assume DFT-symmetric windows. So it is worth noting that there is no performance advantage when applied to time domain data, which is the customary application. The advantage of real-valued DFT coefficients is realized in certain esoteric applications where windowing is achieved by means of convolution between the DFT coefficients and an unwindowed DFT of the data. In those applications, DFT-symmetric windows (even or odd length) from the Cosine-sum family are preferred, because most of their DFT coefficients are zero-valued, making the convolution very efficient. = Filter design = Windows are sometimes used in the design of digital filters, in particular to convert an \\"ideal\\" impulse response of infinite duration, such as a sinc function, to a finite impulse response (FIR) filter design. That is called the window method. = Statistics and curve fitting = Window functions are sometimes used in the field of statistical analysis to restrict the set of data being analyzed to a range near a given point, with a weighting factor that diminishes the effect of points farther away from the portion of the curve being fit. In the field of Bayesian analysis and curve fitting, this is often referred to as the kernel. = Rectangular window applications =  Analysis of transients  When analyzing a transient signal in modal analysis, such as an impulse, a shock response, a sine burst, a chirp burst, or noise burst, where the energy vs time distribution is extremely uneven, the rectangular window may be most appropriate. For instance, when most of the energy is located at the beginning of the recording, a non-rectangular window attenuates most of the energy, degrading the signal-to-noise ratio.  Harmonic analysis  One might wish to measure the harmonic content of a musical note from a particular instrument or the harmonic distortion of an amplifier at a given frequency. Referring again to Figure 2, we can observe that there is no leakage at a discrete set of harmonically-related frequencies sampled by the DFT. (The spectral nulls are actually zero-crossings, which cannot be shown on a logarithmic scale such as this.) This property is unique to the rectangular window, and it must be appropriately configured for the signal frequency, as described above.  A list of window functions  Conventions: *w_0(x) is a zero-phase function (symmetrical about x=0), continuous for x \\\\in [-N/2, N/2], where N is a positive integer (even or odd). *The sequence \\\\\\\\{w[n] = w_0(n-N/2),\\\\quad 0\\\\le n \\\\le N\\\\\\\\} is symmetric, of length N+1. *\\\\\\\\{w[n],\\\\quad 0\\\\le n \\\\le N-1\\\\\\\\} is DFT-symmetric, of length N. *The parameter B displayed on each spectral plot is the function's noise equivalent bandwidth metric, in units of DFT bins. The sparse sampling of a DTFT (such as the DFTs in Fig 2) only reveals the leakage into the DFT bins from a sinusoid whose frequency is also an integer DFT bin. The unseen sidelobes reveal the leakage to expect from sinusoids at other frequencies. Therefore, when choosing a window function, it is usually important to sample the DTFT more densely (as we do throughout this section) and choose a window that suppresses the sidelobes to an acceptable level. = Rectangular window = Rectangular window The rectangular window (sometimes known as the boxcar or Dirichlet window) is the simplest window, equivalent to replacing all but N values of a data sequence by zeros, making it appear as though the waveform suddenly turns on and off: :w[n] = 1. Other windows are designed to moderate these sudden changes, which reduces scalloping loss and improves dynamic range, as described above (). The rectangular window is the 1st order B-spline window as well as the 0th power Power-of-sine window. = B-spline windows = B-spline windows can be obtained as k-fold convolutions of the rectangular window. They include the rectangular window itself (k = 1), the (k = 2) and the (k = 4). Alternative definitions sample the appropriate normalized B-spline basis functions instead of convolving discrete-time windows. A kth order B-spline basis function is a piece-wise polynomial function of degree k‚àí1 that is obtained by k-fold self-convolution of the rectangular function.  Triangular window  Triangular window (with L=N+1) Triangular windows are given by: :w[n] = 1 - \\\\left\\\\frac{n-\\\\frac{N}{2}}{\\\\frac{L}{2}}\\\\right,\\\\quad 0\\\\le n \\\\le N where L can be N, N+1, or N+2. The first one is also known as Bartlett window or Fej√©r window. All three definitions converge at large N. The triangular window is the 2nd order B-spline window. The L=N form can be seen as the convolution of two N/2 width rectangular windows. The Fourier transform of the result is the squared values of the transform of the half- width rectangular window.  Parzen window  Parzen window Defining , the Parzen window, also known as the de la Vall√©e Poussin window, is the 4th order B-spline window given by: : w_0(n) \\\\triangleq \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{array}{ll} 1 - 6 \\\\left(\\\\frac{n}{L/2}\\\\right)^2 \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{n}{L/2}\\\\right), & 0 \\\\le n \\\\le \\\\frac{L}{4} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{n}{L/2}\\\\right)^3 & \\\\frac{L}{4} < n \\\\le \\\\frac{L}{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} :w[n] = \\\\ w_0\\\\left(n-\\\\tfrac{N}{2}\\\\right),\\\\ 0 \\\\le n \\\\le N Welch window = Other polynomial windows =  Welch window  The Welch window consists of a single parabolic section: :w[n]=1 - \\\\left(\\\\frac{n-\\\\frac{N}{2}}{\\\\frac{N}{2}}\\\\right)^2,\\\\quad 0\\\\le n \\\\le N. The defining quadratic polynomial reaches a value of zero at the samples just outside the span of the window. = Sine window = Sine window :w[n] = \\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi n}{N}\\\\right) = \\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi n}{N} - \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}\\\\right),\\\\quad 0\\\\le n \\\\le N. The corresponding w_0(n)\\\\, function is a cosine without the œÄ/2 phase offset. So the sine window is sometimes also called cosine window. As it represents half a cycle of a sinusoidal function, it is also known variably as half-sine window or half-cosine window. The autocorrelation of a sine window produces a function known as the Bohman window.  Power-of-sine/cosine windows  These window functions have the form: :w[n] = \\\\sin^\\\\alpha\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi n}{N}\\\\right) = \\\\cos^\\\\alpha\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi n}{N} - \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}\\\\right),\\\\quad 0\\\\le n \\\\le N. The (), the (), and the Hann window () are members of this family. = Cosine- sum windows = This family is also known as generalized cosine windows. In most cases, including the examples below, all coefficients ak ‚â• 0. These windows have only 2K + 1 non-zero N-point DFT coefficients.  Hann and Hamming windows  Hann window Hamming window, a0 = 0.53836 and a1 = 0.46164. The original Hamming window would have a0 = 0.54 and a1 = 0.46. The customary cosine-sum windows for case K = 1 have the form: :w[n] = a_0 - \\\\underbrace{(1-a_0)}_{a_1}\\\\cdot \\\\cos\\\\left( \\\\tfrac{2 \\\\pi n}{N} \\\\right),\\\\quad 0\\\\le n \\\\le N, which is easily (and often) confused with its zero-phase version: : \\\\begin{align} w_0(n)\\\\ &= w\\\\left[ n+\\\\tfrac{N}{2}\\\\right]\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= a_0 + a_1\\\\cdot \\\\cos \\\\left ( \\\\tfrac{2\\\\pi n}{N} \\\\right),\\\\quad -\\\\tfrac{N}{2} \\\\le n \\\\le \\\\tfrac{N}{2}. \\\\end{align} Setting a_0 = 0.5 produces a Hann window: :w[n] = 0.5\\\\; \\\\left[1 - \\\\cos \\\\left ( \\\\frac{2 \\\\pi n}{N} \\\\right) \\\\right] = \\\\sin^2 \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\pi n}{N} \\\\right), named after Julius von Hann, and sometimes referred to as Hanning, presumably due to its linguistic and formulaic similarities to the Hamming window. It is also known as raised cosine, because the zero-phase version, w_0(n), is one lobe of an elevated cosine function. This function is a member of both the cosine-sum and power-of-sine families. Unlike the Hamming window, the end points of the Hann window just touch zero. The resulting side- lobes roll off at about 18 dB per octave. Setting a_0 to approximately 0.54, or more precisely 25/46, produces the Hamming window, proposed by Richard W. Hamming. That choice places a zero-crossing at frequency 5œÄ/(N ‚àí 1), which cancels the first sidelobe of the Hann window, giving it a height of about one-fifth that of the Hann window. The Hamming window is often called the Hamming blip when used for pulse shaping. Approximation of the coefficients to two decimal places substantially lowers the level of sidelobes, to a nearly equiripple condition. In the equiripple sense, the optimal values for the coefficients are a0 = 0.53836 and a1 = 0.46164. Hamming window is used for Audio Spectrum effect in Adobe After Effects.  Blackman window  Blackman window; Blackman windows are defined as: :w[n] = a_0 - a_1 \\\\cos \\\\left ( \\\\frac{2 \\\\pi n}{N} \\\\right) + a_2 \\\\cos \\\\left ( \\\\frac{4 \\\\pi n}{N} \\\\right) :a_0=\\\\frac{1-\\\\alpha}{2};\\\\quad a_1=\\\\frac{1}{2};\\\\quad a_2=\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2}. By common convention, the unqualified term Blackman window refers to Blackman's \\"not very serious proposal\\" of (a0 = 0.42, a1 = 0.5, a2 = 0.08), which closely approximates the exact Blackman, with a0 = 7938/18608 ‚âà 0.42659, a1 = 9240/18608 ‚âà 0.49656, and a2 = 1430/18608 ‚âà 0.076849. These exact values place zeros at the third and fourth sidelobes, but result in a discontinuity at the edges and a 6 dB/oct fall-off. The truncated coefficients do not null the sidelobes as well, but have an improved 18 dB/oct fall-off.  Nuttall window, continuous first derivative  Nuttall window, continuous first derivative The continuous form of Nuttall window, w_0(x), and its first derivative are continuous everywhere, like the Hann function. That is, the function goes to 0 at unlike the Blackman‚ÄìNuttall, Blackman‚ÄìHarris, and Hamming windows. The Blackman window () is also continuous with continuous derivative at the edge, but the \\"exact Blackman window\\" is not. :w[n]=a_0 - a_1 \\\\cos \\\\left ( \\\\frac{2 \\\\pi n}{N} \\\\right)+ a_2 \\\\cos \\\\left ( \\\\frac{4 \\\\pi n}{N} \\\\right)- a_3 \\\\cos \\\\left ( \\\\frac{6 \\\\pi n}{N} \\\\right) :a_0=0.355768;\\\\quad a_1=0.487396;\\\\quad a_2=0.144232;\\\\quad a_3=0.012604.

Blackman‚ÄìHarris window  Blackman‚ÄìHarris window A generalization of the Hamming family, produced by adding more shifted sinc functions, meant to minimize side-lobe levels :w[n]=a_0 - a_1 \\\\cos \\\\left ( \\\\frac{2 \\\\pi n}{N} \\\\right)+ a_2 \\\\cos \\\\left ( \\\\frac{4 \\\\pi n}{N} \\\\right)- a_3 \\\\cos \\\\left ( \\\\frac{6 \\\\pi n}{N} \\\\right) :a_0=0.35875;\\\\quad a_1=0.48829;\\\\quad a_2=0.14128;\\\\quad a_3=0.01168.  Flat top window  Flat Top window A flat top window is a partially negative- valued window that has minimal scalloping loss in the frequency domain. That property is desirable for the measurement of amplitudes of sinusoidal frequency components. Drawbacks of the broad bandwidth are poor frequency resolution and high . Flat top windows can be designed using low-pass filter design methods, or they may be of the usual cosine-sum variety: : \\\\begin{align} w[n] = a_0 &\\\\- a_1 \\\\cos \\\\left ( \\\\frac{2 \\\\pi n}{N} \\\\right)+ a_2 \\\\cos \\\\left ( \\\\frac{4 \\\\pi n}{N} \\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\- a_3 \\\\cos \\\\left ( \\\\frac{6 \\\\pi n}{N} \\\\right)+a_4 \\\\cos \\\\left ( \\\\frac{8 \\\\pi n}{N} \\\\right). \\\\end{align} The Matlab variant has these coefficients: :a_0=0.21557895;\\\\quad a_1=0.41663158;\\\\quad a_2=0.277263158;\\\\quad a_3=0.083578947;\\\\quad a_4=0.006947368. Other variations are available, such as sidelobes that roll off at the cost of higher values near the main lobe.  Rife‚ÄìVincent windows  Rife‚ÄìVincent windows are customarily scaled for unity average value, instead of unity peak value. The coefficient values below, applied to , reflect that custom. Class I, Order 1 (K=1): a_0=1;\\\\quad a_1=1 Functionally equivalent to the Hann window. Class I, Order 2 (K=2): a_0=1;\\\\quad a_1=\\\\tfrac{4}{3};\\\\quad a_2=\\\\tfrac{1}{3} Class I is defined by minimizing the high-order sidelobe amplitude. Coefficients for orders up to K=4 are tabulated. Class II minimizes the main-lobe width for a given maximum side-lobe. Class III is a compromise for which order K = 2 resembles the . = Adjustable windows =  Gaussian window  Gaussian window, œÉ = 0.4 The Fourier transform of a Gaussian is also a Gaussian. Since the support of a Gaussian function extends to infinity, it must either be truncated at the ends of the window, or itself windowed with another zero-ended window. Since the log of a Gaussian produces a parabola, this can be used for nearly exact quadratic interpolation in frequency estimation. :w[n]=\\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left ( \\\\frac{n-N/2}{\\\\sigma N/2} \\\\right)^{2}\\\\right),\\\\quad 0\\\\le n \\\\le N. :\\\\sigma \\\\le \\\\;0.5\\\\, The standard deviation of the Gaussian function is œÉ * N/2 sampling periods. Confined Gaussian window, œÉt = 0.1  Confined Gaussian window  The confined Gaussian window yields the smallest possible root mean square frequency width for a given temporal width . These windows optimize the RMS time-frequency bandwidth products. They are computed as the minimum eigenvectors of a parameter-dependent matrix. The confined Gaussian window family contains the and the in the limiting cases of large and small , respectively. Approximate confined Gaussian window,  Approximate confined Gaussian window  Defining , a of temporal width is well approximated by: :w[n] = G(n) - \\\\frac{G(-\\\\tfrac{1}{2})[G(n + L) + G(n - L)]}{G(-\\\\tfrac{1}{2} + L) + G(-\\\\tfrac{1}{2} - L)} where G is a Gaussian function: ::G(x) = \\\\exp\\\\left(- \\\\left(\\\\cfrac{x - \\\\frac{N}{2}}{2 L \\\\sigma_t}\\\\right)^2\\\\right) The standard deviation of the approximate window is asymptotically equal (i.e. large values of ) to for .  Generalized normal window  A more generalized version of the Gaussian window is the generalized normal window. Retaining the notation from the Gaussian window above, we can represent this window as :w[n,p]=\\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\left ( \\\\frac{n-N/2}{\\\\sigma N/2} \\\\right)^{p}\\\\right) for any even p. At p=2, this is a Gaussian window and as p approaches \\\\infty, this approximates to a rectangular window. The Fourier transform of this window does not exist in a closed form for a general p. However, it demonstrates the other benefits of being smooth, adjustable bandwidth. Like the , this window naturally offers a \\"flat top\\" to control the amplitude attenuation of a time-series (on which we don't have a control with Gaussian window). In essence, it offers a good (controllable) compromise, in terms of spectral leakage, frequency resolution and amplitude attenuation, between the Gaussian window and the rectangular window. See also for a study on time-frequency representation of this window (or function).  Tukey window  Tukey window, Defining , the Tukey window, also known as the cosine-tapered window, can be regarded as a cosine lobe of width that is convolved with a rectangular window of width . : \\\\left . \\\\begin{array}{lll} w[n] = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left[1-\\\\cos \\\\left(\\\\frac{2\\\\pi n}{\\\\alpha L} \\\\right) \\\\right],\\\\quad & 0 \\\\le n < \\\\frac{\\\\alpha L}{2}\\\\\\\\\\\\ w[n] = 1,\\\\quad & \\\\frac{\\\\alpha L}{2} \\\\le n \\\\le \\\\frac{N}{2}\\\\\\\\\\\\ w[N-n] = w[n],\\\\quad & 0 \\\\le n \\\\le \\\\frac{N}{2} \\\\end{array}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} At it becomes rectangular, and at it becomes a Hann window.  Planck-taper window  Planck-taper window, Œµ = 0.1 The so- called \\"Planck-taper\\" window is a bump function that has been widely used in the theory of partitions of unity in manifolds. It is smooth (a C^\\\\infty function) everywhere, but is exactly zero outside of a compact region, exactly one over an interval within that region, and varies smoothly and monotonically between those limits. Its use as a window function in signal processing was first suggested in the context of gravitational-wave astronomy, inspired by the Planck distribution. It is defined as a piecewise function: : \\\\left . \\\\begin{array}{lll} w[0] = 0, \\\\\\\\\\\\ w[n] = \\\\left(1 + \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\epsilon N}{n} - \\\\frac{\\\\epsilon N}{\\\\epsilon N - n}\\\\right)\\\\right)^{-1},\\\\quad & 1 \\\\le n < \\\\epsilon N \\\\\\\\\\\\ w[n] = 1,\\\\quad & \\\\epsilon N \\\\le n \\\\le \\\\frac{N}{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ w[N-n] = w[n],\\\\quad & 0 \\\\le n \\\\le \\\\frac{N}{2} \\\\end{array}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} The amount of tapering is controlled by the parameter Œµ, with smaller values giving sharper transitions.  DPSS or Slepian window  The DPSS (discrete prolate spheroidal sequence) or Slepian window maximizes the energy concentration in the main lobe, and is used in multitaper spectral analysis, which averages out noise in the spectrum and reduces information loss at the edges of the window. The main lobe ends at a frequency bin given by the parameter Œ±. { DPSS window, Œ± = 2 DPSS window, Œ± = 3 } The Kaiser windows below are created by a simple approximation to the DPSS windows: { Kaiser window, Œ± = 2 Kaiser window, Œ± = 3 }  Kaiser window  The Kaiser, or Kaiser-Bessel, window is a simple approximation of the DPSS window using Bessel functions, discovered by James Kaiser. :w[n]=\\\\frac{I_0\\\\left(\\\\pi\\\\alpha \\\\sqrt{1-\\\\left(\\\\frac{2 n}{N}-1\\\\right)^2}\\\\right)}{I_0(\\\\pi\\\\alpha)},\\\\quad 0\\\\le n \\\\le N : w_0(n) = \\\\frac{I_0\\\\left(\\\\pi\\\\alpha \\\\sqrt{1-\\\\left(\\\\frac{2 n}{N}\\\\right)^2}\\\\right)}{I_0(\\\\pi\\\\alpha)},\\\\quad -N/2 \\\\le n \\\\le N/2 where I_0 is the zero-th order modified Bessel function of the first kind. Variable parameter \\\\alpha determines the tradeoff between main lobe width and side lobe levels of the spectral leakage pattern. The main lobe width, in between the nulls, is given by 2\\\\sqrt{1 + \\\\alpha^2}, in units of DFT bins, and a typical value of \\\\alpha is 3.  Dolph‚ÄìChebyshev window  Dolph‚ÄìChebyshev window, Œ± = 5 Minimizes the Chebyshev norm of the side-lobes for a given main lobe width. The zero-phase Dolph‚ÄìChebyshev window function w_0[n] is usually defined in terms of its real-valued discrete Fourier transform, W_0[k]: : W_0(k) = \\\\frac{T_{N} \\\\big(\\\\beta \\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi k}{N+1}\\\\right)\\\\big)}{T_{N} (\\\\beta)} = \\\\frac{T_N \\\\big(\\\\beta \\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi k}{N+1}\\\\right)\\\\big)}{10^\\\\alpha},\\\\ 0 \\\\le k \\\\le N. Tn(x) is the n-th Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind evaluated in x, which can be computed using :T_n(x) =\\\\begin{cases} \\\\cos\\\\\\\\!\\\\big(n \\\\cos^{-1}(x) \\\\big) & \\\\text{if }-1 \\\\le x \\\\le 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cosh\\\\\\\\!\\\\big(n \\\\cosh^{-1}(x) \\\\big) & \\\\text{if }x \\\\ge 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ (-1)^n \\\\cosh\\\\\\\\!\\\\big(n \\\\cosh^{-1}(-x) \\\\big) & \\\\text{if }x \\\\le -1, \\\\end{cases} and :\\\\beta = \\\\cosh\\\\\\\\!\\\\big(\\\\tfrac{1}{N} \\\\cosh^{-1}(10^\\\\alpha)\\\\big) is the unique positive real solution to T_N(\\\\beta) = 10^\\\\alpha, where the parameter Œ± sets the Chebyshev norm of the sidelobes to ‚àí20Œ± decibels. The window function can be calculated from W0(k) by an inverse discrete Fourier transform (DFT): :w_0(n) = \\\\frac{1}{N+1} \\\\sum_{k=0}^N W_0(k) \\\\cdot e^{i 2 \\\\pi k n / (N+1)},\\\\ -N/2 \\\\le n \\\\le N/2. The lagged version of the window can be obtained by: :w[n] = w_0\\\\left(n-\\\\frac{N}{2}\\\\right),\\\\quad 0 \\\\le n \\\\le N, which for even values of N must be computed as follows: :\\\\begin{align} w_0\\\\left(n-\\\\frac{N}{2}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{N+1} \\\\sum_{k=0}^{N} W_0(k) \\\\cdot e^{\\\\frac{i 2 \\\\pi k (n-N/2)}{N+1}} = \\\\frac{1}{N+1} \\\\sum_{k=0}^{N} \\\\left[ \\\\left(-e^{\\\\frac{i\\\\pi}{N+1}}\\\\right)^k \\\\cdot W_0(k)\\\\right] e^{\\\\frac{i 2 \\\\pi k n}{N+1}}, \\\\end{align} which is an inverse DFT of \\\\left(-e^{\\\\frac{i\\\\pi}{N+1}}\\\\right)^k\\\\cdot W_0(k). Variations: *Due to the equiripple condition, the time-domain window has discontinuities at the edges. An approximation that avoids them, by allowing the equiripples to drop off at the edges, is a Taylor window. *An alternative to the inverse DFT definition is also available..  Ultraspherical window  The Ultraspherical window's ¬µ parameter determines whether its Fourier transform's side-lobe amplitudes decrease, are level, or (shown here) increase with frequency. The Ultraspherical window was introduced in 1984 by Roy Streit and has application in antenna array design, non-recursive filter design, and spectrum analysis. Like other adjustable windows, the Ultraspherical window has parameters that can be used to control its Fourier transform main-lobe width and relative side-lobe amplitude. Uncommon to other windows, it has an additional parameter which can be used to set the rate at which side-lobes decrease (or increase) in amplitude. The window can be expressed in the time-domain as follows: :\\\\begin{align} w[n] = \\\\frac{1}{N+1} \\\\left[ C^{\\\\mu}_{N}(x_0)+\\\\sum_{k=1}^{\\\\frac{N}{2}} C^{\\\\mu}_{N}\\\\left(x_{0}\\\\cos\\\\frac{k\\\\pi}{N+1}\\\\right)\\\\cos\\\\frac{2n\\\\pi k}{N+1} \\\\right] \\\\end{align} where C^{\\\\mu}_{N} is the Ultraspherical polynomial of degree N, and x_0 and \\\\mu control the side-lobe patterns. Certain specific values of \\\\mu yield other well-known windows: \\\\mu=0 and \\\\mu=1 give the Dolph‚ÄìChebyshev and Saram√§ki windows respectively. See here for illustration of Ultraspherical windows with varied parametrization.  Exponential or Poisson window  Exponential window, œÑ = N/2 Exponential window, œÑ = (N/2)/(60/8.69) The Poisson window, or more generically the exponential window increases exponentially towards the center of the window and decreases exponentially in the second half. Since the exponential function never reaches zero, the values of the window at its limits are non-zero (it can be seen as the multiplication of an exponential function by a rectangular window ). It is defined by :w[n]=e^{-\\\\leftn-\\\\frac{N}{2}\\\\right\\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau}}, where œÑ is the time constant of the function. The exponential function decays as e ‚âÉ 2.71828 or approximately 8.69 dB per time constant. This means that for a targeted decay of D dB over half of the window length, the time constant œÑ is given by :\\\\tau = \\\\frac{N}{2}\\\\frac{8.69}{D}. = Hybrid windows = Window functions have also been constructed as multiplicative or additive combinations of other windows.  Bartlett‚ÄìHann window  Bartlett‚ÄìHann window :w[n]=a_0 - a_1 \\\\left \\\\frac{n}{N}-\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\right - a_2 \\\\cos \\\\left (\\\\frac{2 \\\\pi n}{N}\\\\right ) :a_0=0.62;\\\\quad a_1=0.48;\\\\quad a_2=0.38\\\\,  Planck‚ÄìBessel window  Planck‚ÄìBessel window, Œµ = 0.1, Œ± = 4.45 A multiplied by a Kaiser window which is defined in terms of a modified Bessel function. This hybrid window function was introduced to decrease the peak side-lobe level of the Planck-taper window while still exploiting its good asymptotic decay. It has two tunable parameters, Œµ from the Planck-taper and Œ± from the Kaiser window, so it can be adjusted to fit the requirements of a given signal.  Hann‚ÄìPoisson window  Hann‚ÄìPoisson window, Œ± = 2 A Hann window multiplied by a Poisson window, which has no side-lobes, in the sense that its Fourier transform drops off forever away from the main lobe. It can thus be used in hill climbing algorithms like Newton's method. The Hann‚ÄìPoisson window is defined by: :w[n]=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(1-\\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{2 \\\\pi n}{N}\\\\right)\\\\right)e^\\\\frac{-\\\\alpha\\\\leftN - 2n\\\\right}{N}\\\\,=\\\\operatorname{hav}\\\\left(\\\\frac{2 \\\\pi n}{N}\\\\right)e^\\\\frac{-\\\\alpha\\\\leftN - 2n\\\\right}{N}\\\\, where Œ± is a parameter that controls the slope of the exponential. = Other windows =  Lanczos window  Sinc or Lanczos window :w[n] = \\\\operatorname{sinc}\\\\left(\\\\frac{2n}{N}-1\\\\right) * used in Lanczos resampling * for the Lanczos window, \\\\operatorname{sinc}(x) is defined as \\\\sin(\\\\pi x)/\\\\pi x * also known as a sinc window, because: ::w_0(n) = \\\\operatorname{sinc}\\\\left(\\\\frac{2n}{N}\\\\right)\\\\, is the main lobe of a normalized sinc function  Comparison of windows  Window functions in the frequency domain (\\"spectral leakage\\") When selecting an appropriate window function for an application, this comparison graph may be useful. The frequency axis has units of FFT \\"bins\\" when the window of length N is applied to data and a transform of length N is computed. For instance, the value at frequency ¬Ω \\"bin\\" (third tick mark) is the response that would be measured in bins k and k+1 to a sinusoidal signal at frequency k+¬Ω. It is relative to the maximum possible response, which occurs when the signal frequency is an integer number of bins. The value at frequency ¬Ω is referred to as the maximum scalloping loss of the window, which is one metric used to compare windows. The rectangular window is noticeably worse than the others in terms of that metric. Other metrics that can be seen are the width of the main lobe and the peak level of the sidelobes, which respectively determine the ability to resolve comparable strength signals and disparate strength signals. The rectangular window (for instance) is the best choice for the former and the worst choice for the latter. What cannot be seen from the graphs is that the rectangular window has the best noise bandwidth, which makes it a good candidate for detecting low-level sinusoids in an otherwise white noise environment. Interpolation techniques, such as zero-padding and frequency- shifting, are available to mitigate its potential scalloping loss.  Overlapping windows  When the length of a data set to be transformed is larger than necessary to provide the desired frequency resolution, a common practice is to subdivide it into smaller sets and window them individually. To mitigate the \\"loss\\" at the edges of the window, the individual sets may overlap in time. See Welch method of power spectral analysis and the modified discrete cosine transform.  Two-dimensional windows  Two-dimensional windows are commonly used in image processing to reduce unwanted high- frequencies in the image Fourier transform. They can be constructed from one- dimensional windows in either of two forms. The separable form, W(m,n)=w(m)w(n) is trivial to compute. The radial form, W(m,n)=w(r), which involves the radius r=\\\\sqrt{(m-M/2)^2+(n-N/2)^2}, is isotropic, independent on the orientation of the coordinate axes. Only the Gaussian function is both separable and isotropic. The separable forms of all other window functions have corners that depend on the choice of the coordinate axes. The isotropy/anisotropy of a two-dimensional window function is shared by its two- dimensional Fourier transform. The difference between the separable and radial forms is akin to the result of diffraction from rectangular vs. circular appertures, which can be visualized in terms of the product of two sinc functions vs. an Airy function, respectively.

The pain is typically worse with movement. It most commonly occurs around the shoulder (rotator cuff tendinitis, biceps tendinitis), elbow (tennis elbow, golfer's elbow), wrist, hip, knee (jumper's knee), or ankle (Achilles tendinitis). Causes may include an injury or repetitive activities. Groups at risk include people who do manual labor, musicians, and athletes. Less common causes include infection, arthritis, gout, thyroid disease, and diabetes. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms, examination, and occasionally medical imaging. A few weeks following an injury little inflammation remains, with the underlying problem related to weak or disrupted tendon fibrils. Treatment may include rest, NSAIDs, splinting, and physiotherapy. Less commonly steroid injections or surgery may be done. About 80% of people get better within six months. Tendinopathy is relatively common. Older people are more commonly affected. It results in a large amount of missed work. Signs and symptoms Symptoms includes tenderness on palpation, swelling, and pain, often when exercising or with a specific movement. Cause Causes may include an injury or repetitive activities. Groups at risk include people who do manual labor, musicians, and athletes. Less common causes include infection, arthritis, gout, thyroid disease, and diabetes. Despite the injury of the tendon there is poor healing. Quinolone antibiotics are associated with increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture.FDA May 12, 2016 FDA Drug Safety Communication: FDA advises restricting fluoroquinolone antibiotic use for certain uncomplicated infections; warns about disabling side effects that can occur A 2013 review found the incidence of tendon injury among those taking fluoroquinolones to be between 0.08 and 0.2%. Fluoroquinolones most frequently affect large load-bearing tendons in the lower limb, especially the Achilles tendon which ruptures in approximately 30 to 40% of cases. =Types= * Achilles tendinitis * Calcific tendinitis * Patellar tendinitis (jumper's knee) Pathophysiology As of 2016 the pathophysiology is poorly understood; while inflammation appears to play a role, the relationships among changes to the structure of tissue, the function of tendons, and pain are not understood and there are several competing models, none of which had been fully validated or falsified. Molecular mechanisms involved in inflammation includes release of inflammatory cytokines like IL-1Œ≤ which reduces the expression of type I collagen mRNA in human tenocytes and causes extracellular matrix degradation in tendon. There are multifactorial theories that could include: tensile overload, tenocyte related collagen synthesis disruption, load-induced ischemia, neural sprouting, thermal damage, and adaptive compressive responses. The intratendinous sliding motion of fascicles and shear force at interfaces of fascicles could be an important mechanical factor for the development of tendinopathy and predispose tendons to rupture. Obesity, or more specifically, adiposity or fatness, has also been linked to an increasing incidence of tendinopathy. The most commonly accepted cause for this condition however is seen to be an overuse syndrome in combination with intrinsic and extrinsic factors leading to what may be seen as a progressive interference or the failing of the innate healing response. Tendinopathy involves cellular apoptosis, matrix disorganization and neovascularization. Classic characteristics of \\"tendinosis\\" include degenerative changes in the collagenous matrix, hypercellularity, hypervascularity, and a lack of inflammatory cells which has challenged the original misnomer \\"tendinitis\\". Histological findings include granulation tissue, microrupture, degenerative changes, and there is no traditional inflammation. As a consequence, ‚Äúlateral elbow tendinopathy or tendinosis‚Äù is used instead of ‚Äúlateral epicondylitis‚Äù. Examination of tennis elbow tissue reveals noninflammatory tissue, so the term ‚Äúangiofibroblastic tendinosis‚Äù is used. Cultures from tendinopathic tendons contain an increased production of type III collagen. Longitudinal sonogram of the lateral elbow displays thickening and heterogeneity of the common extensor tendon that is consistent with tendinosis, as the ultrasound reveals calcifications, intrasubstance tears, and marked irregularity of the lateral epicondyle. Although the term ‚Äúepicondylitis‚Äù is frequently used to describe this disorder, most histopathologic findings of studies have displayed no evidence of an acute, or a chronic inflammatory process. Histologic studies have demonstrated that this condition is the result of tendon degeneration, which causes normal tissue to be replaced by a disorganized arrangement of collagen. Therefore, the disorder is more appropriately referred to as ‚Äútendinosis‚Äù or ‚Äútendinopathy‚Äù rather than ‚Äútendinitis.‚Äù Colour Doppler ultrasound reveals structural tendon changes, with vascularity and hypo-echoic areas that correspond to the areas of pain in the extensor origin. Load- induced non-rupture tendinopathy in humans is associated with an increase in the ratio of collagen III:I proteins, a shift from large to small diameter collagen fibrils, buckling of the collagen fascicles in the tendon extracellular matrix, and buckling of the tenocyte cells and their nuclei.  Diagnosis  Diagram illustrating tendonitis and tendon rupture Symptoms can vary from aches or pains and local joint stiffness, to a burning that surrounds the whole joint around the inflamed tendon. In some cases, swelling occurs along with heat and redness, and there may be visible knots surrounding the joint. With this condition, the pain is usually worse during and after activity, and the tendon and joint area can become stiff the following day as muscles tighten from the movement of the tendon. Many patients report stressful situations in their life in correlation with the beginnings of pain which may contribute to the symptoms. = Medical imaging = Ultrasound imaging can be used to evaluate tissue strain, as well as other mechanical properties. Ultrasound-based techniques are becoming more popular because of its affordability, safety, and speed. Ultrasound can be used for imaging tissues, and the sound waves can also provide information about the mechanical state of the tissue. Treatment Treatment of tendon injuries is largely conservative. Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), rest, and gradual return to exercise is a common therapy. Resting assists in the prevention of further damage to the tendon. Ice, compression and elevation are also frequently recommended. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, orthotics or braces may also be useful. Initial recovery is typically within 2 to 3 days and full recovery is within 3 to 6 months. Tendinosis occurs as the acute phase of healing has ended (6‚Äì8 weeks) but has left the area insufficiently healed. Treatment of tendinitis helps reduce some of the risks of developing tendinosis, which takes longer to heal. There is tentative evidence that low- level laser therapy may also be beneficial in treating tendinopathy. The effects of deep transverse friction massage for treating tennis elbow and lateral knee tendinitis is unclear. =NSAIDs= NSAIDs may be used to help with pain. They however do not alter long term outcomes. Other types of pain medication, like paracetamol, may be just as useful. =Steroids= Steroid injections have not been shown to have long term benefits but have been shown to be more effective than NSAIDs in the short term. They appear to have little benefit in tendinitis of the rotator cuff. There are some concerns that they may have negative effects. =Other injections= There is insufficient evidence on the routine use of injection therapies (autologous blood, platelet-rich plasma, deproteinised haemodialysate, aprotinin, polysulphated glycosaminoglycan, skin derived fibroblasts etc.) for treating Achilles tendinopathy. As of 2014 there was insufficient evidence to support the use of platelet-rich therapies for treating musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries such as ligament, muscle and tendon tears and tendinopathies. Prognosis Initial recovery is usually within 2 to 3 months, and full recovery usually within 3 to 6 months. About 80% of people will fully recover within 12 months. Epidemiology Tendon injury and resulting tendinopathy are responsible for up to 30% of consultations to sports doctors and other musculoskeletal health providers. Tendinopathy is most often seen in tendons of athletes either before or after an injury but is becoming more common in non-athletes and sedentary populations. For example, the majority of patients with Achilles tendinopathy in a general population-based study did not associate their condition with a sporting activity. In another study the population incidence of Achilles tendinopathy increased sixfold from 1979-1986 to 1987-1994.Leppilahti J, Puranen J, Orava S. Incidence of Achilles tendon rupture. Acta Orthop Scand. 1996;67:277-9 The incidence of rotator cuff tendinopathy ranges from 0.3% to 5.5% and annual prevalence from 0.5% to 7.4%. Terminology Tendonitis is a very common, but misleading term. By definition, the suffix \\"-itis\\" means \\"inflammation of\\". Inflammation is the body's local response to tissue damage which involves red blood cells, white blood cells, blood proteins with dilation of blood vessels around the site of injury. Tendons are relatively avascular. Corticosteroids are drugs that reduce inflammation. Corticosteroids can be useful to relieve chronic tendinopathy pain, improve function, and reduce swelling in the short term. However, there is a greater risk of long-term recurrence. They are typically injected along with a small amount of a numbing drug called lidocaine. Research shows that tendons are weaker following corticosteroid injections. Tendinitis is still a very common diagnosis, though research increasingly documents that what is thought to be tendinitis is usually tendinosis. Anatomically close but separate conditions are: *Enthesitis, wherein there is inflammation of the entheses, the sites where tendons or ligaments insert into the bone. It is associated with HLA B27 arthropathies such as ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and reactive arthritis. *Apophysitis, inflammation of the bony attachment, generally associated with overuse among growing children. Research The use of a nitric oxide delivery system (glyceryl trinitrate patches) applied over the area of maximal tenderness was found to reduce pain and increase range of motion and strength. A promising therapy involves eccentric loading exercises involving lengthening muscular contractions. Other animals Bowed tendon is a horseman's term for tendinitis (inflammation) and tendinosis (degeneration), most commonly seen in the superficial digital flexor tendon in the front leg of horses. Mesenchymal stem cells, derived from a horse's bone marrow or fat, are currently being used for tendon repair in horses.

He is the co-founder of BET, which was acquired by Viacom in 2001. He also founded RLJ Companies, a holding company that invests in various business sectors. Johnson is the former majority owner of the Charlotte Bobcats. He became the first black American billionaire. Johnson's companies have counted among the most prominent African-American businesses in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Early life and education Johnson was born in 1946 in Hickory, Mississippi, the ninth out of ten children to Edna and Archie Johnson. His mother was a schoolteacher and his father was a farmer. His parents moved the family to Freeport, Illinois when he was a child. He was an honors student in high school. Johnson graduated from the University of Illinois in 1968 with a bachelor's degree in social studies. While at the University of Illinois, Johnson became a member of the Beta chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity. He received a master's degree in public affairs from the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University in 1972. Career President George H. W. Bush in 1990 President George W. Bush sits with Johnson during a meeting to discuss the economy with small business owners and community bankers in 2006 President Donald Trump watches as Johnson addresses his remarks at the Roosevelt Room of the White House in 2018 After graduating from Princeton, Johnson found a job in Washington, D.C., that introduced him to the television industry. He served as the public affairs director for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. In this position is where he learned of the power and untapped potential of television. Around the same time he also worked as the director of communications for the Washington, D.C. office of the National Urban League.\\"The Million Dollar BET: Robert Johnson and the inside story of the Black Entertainment Television by Brett Pulley Johnson worked as a press secretary for Congressman Walter E. Fauntroy. He later became vice president of government relations at the National Cable and Television Association. In 1980, Johnson launched Black Entertainment Television, which became a full- fledged channel in 1983. Johnson left NCTA in 1979 to create Black Entertainment Television, the first cable television network aimed at African- Americans. When the network launched in 1980, it only aired for two hours on Friday night. BET first turned a profit in 1985 and it became the first black- controlled company listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1991. In 1998, Johnson and Liberty Media bought all outstanding shares of the company. This purchase gave Johnson 42% of the company. Viacom acquired BET in 2000 for a reported $3 billion. Johnson remained BET CEO until 2006. Johnson founded The RLJ Companies, a holding company with a diverse portfolio including hotel real estate investment, private equity, financial services, asset management, automobile dealerships, sports and entertainment, and Video lottery terminal gaming. The RLJ Companies is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland. By January 2009, Ion Media had another subchannel network, Urban TV, in the works with him targeted to African-Americans. As of 2013, Johnson was a member of the board of directors for RLJ Lodging Trust, RLJ Entertainment, Inc., KB Home, Lowe's Companies, Inc., Strayer Education, Think Finance, Inc., NBA Board of Governors, The Business Council, and the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of African American History and Culture. Johnson has also served as a member of the board of directors for several other companies and organizations, including US Airways, Hilton Hotels, General Mills, the United Negro College Fund, and Deutsche Bank's Americas Advisory Board. Johnson became the first African-American majority club owner of a major American sports league with his 2002 purchase of the Charlotte Bobcats. In 2010, Johnson sold his majority stake in the Charlotte Bobcats to Michael Jordan. In 2016, Johnson finalized a partnership agreement with AMC Networks through his RLJ Company after launching his own video on demand streaming service Urban Movie Channel in 2014. According to the agreement, AMC will use its programming and distribution clout to benefit Acorn and UMC. Additionally, the RLJ-AMC partnership will allow for greater investment in content from African- American creatives, Johnson emphasized. The agreement called for AMC to provide RLJ with a $60 million loan on a seven-year term and $5 million on a one-year term. AMC has received warrants to purchase at least 20 million shares or the equivalent of 50.1% of the company. The time frame for exercising those warrants is open-ended, AMC said. Johnson's founding, management and sale of Black Entertainment Television is covered in Bayer Mack's 2019 documentary, No Lye: An American Beauty Story, that chronicles the rise and decline of the black-owned ethnic beauty industry. Philanthropy In 2011, Johnson worked with Morgan Freeman to raise funds for hurricane preparedness in the Bahamas. Johnson released a neckwear line in coordination with PVH and The Ella Rose Collection, the RLJ Ella Rose Africa Tie Collection, in 2012 to benefit the charitable organization Malaria No More. In 2007, Johnson created the Liberia Enterprise Development Fund with a $30 million investment. The fund provides credit for Liberian entrepreneurs. Political commentary In January 2008, Johnson became the target of criticism for remarks he made to supporters of Hillary Clinton about President Barack Obama.Drugs, Race Raised in Clinton-Obama Fight\\", CNN, 13 January 2008. Johnson said, \\"As an African-American, I'm frankly insulted that the Obama campaign would imply that we are so stupid that we would think Bill and Hillary Clinton, who have been deeply and emotionally involved in black issues when [President] Barack Obama was doing something in the neighborhood that I won't say what he was doing, [but] he said it in his book.\\" This statement was widely interpreted as a criticism of President Obama's acknowledged use of marijuana in his youth. The Clinton campaign denied this, submitting that the comments were referring to President Obama's work as a community organizer.\\"Drugs, Race Raised in Clinton-Obama Fight\\", CNN, 13 January 2008. In subsequent days, Johnson was roundly criticized for his comments as hypocritical given the prodigious glorification of drug use and sale by artists prominently featured on BET.The Hypocrisy of BET's Bob Johnson's Obama Smears On January 17, 2008, Johnson sent President Obama the following apology:RLJ Development, LLC January 17, 2008 On April 14, 2008, Johnson made comments to the effect that President Obama would not be the Democratic Party's leading candidate if he were not black, in support of the prior statement made by Geraldine Ferraro. He also went on to say \\"I make a joke about [President] Obama doing drugs (and it's) 'Oh my God, a black man tearing down another black man.'\\"Johnson cites race in President Obama's surge Personal life Johnson married Sheila Johnson in 1969.

For a period it had been a territory called Rupert's Land under control of the Hudson's Bay Company. The Resistance was the first crisis the new federal government faced following Canadian Confederation in 1867. The Canadian government had bought Rupert's Land from the Hudson's Bay Company in 1869 and appointed an English-speaking governor, William McDougall. He was opposed by the French-speaking, mostly M√©tis inhabitants of the settlement. Before the land was officially transferred to Canada, McDougall sent out surveyors to plot the land according to the square township system used in the Public Land Survey System. The M√©tis, led by Riel, prevented McDougall from entering the territory. McDougall declared that the Hudson's Bay Company was no longer in control of the territory and that Canada had asked for the transfer of sovereignty to be postponed. The M√©tis created a provisional government, to which they invited an equal number of Anglophone representatives. Riel negotiated directly with the Canadian government to establish Manitoba as a province. Meanwhile, Riel's men arrested members of a pro-Canadian faction who had resisted the provisional government. They included an Orangeman named Thomas Scott. Riel's government tried and convicted Scott, and executed him for threatening to murder Louis Riel. Canada and the Assiniboia provisional government soon negotiated an agreement. In 1870, the national legislature passed the Manitoba Act, allowing the Red River Colony to enter Confederation as the province of Manitoba. The Act also incorporated some of Riel's demands, such as the provision of separate French schools for M√©tis children and protection for the practice of Catholicism. After reaching an agreement, Canada sent a military expedition to Manitoba to enforce federal authority. Now known as the Wolseley Expedition (or Red River Expedition), it consisted of Canadian militia and British regular soldiers led by Colonel Garnet Wolseley. Outrage grew in Ontario over Scott's execution, and many eastern folks demanded that Wolseley's expedition arrest Riel for murder and suppress what they considered to be rebellion. Riel peacefully withdrew from Fort Garry the day the troops arrived. Warned by many that the soldiers would harm him, and denied amnesty for his political leadership of the rebellion, Riel fled to the United States. The arrival of troops marked the end of the Rebellion.  Background  Fort Garry circa 1872 During the late 1860s, the Red River Colony of Rupert's Land was changing rapidly. It had developed under the aegis of the Hudson's Bay Company, which had a continent- wide trading and commercial network. They had been confirmed on this territory by Queen Anne, who had evicted from it Louis XIV and his subjects through the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht.A Collection of Treaties Between Great Britain and Other Powers (1790). See Article X, p.379. Further notice was given when in 1763 George III dispossessed Louis XV of nearly all his North American colonies in the Treaty of Paris. Historically, the population had been composed mainly of Francophone M√©tis, who developed an ethnicity of mixed First Nations-French descent and a unique culture during the decades of the fur trade. During the 18th and 19th centuries, they married among themselves, establishing a tradition of the men working as trappers, guides and interpreters to fur traders, as well as developing farms. M√©tis women also were sometimes active in the trade, as among several influential families in Sault Ste. Marie in the early 19th century in which the husbands were European. The M√©tis culture was based on the French language and Roman Catholic religion. From the later 18th century, as English and Scots men entered the fur trade, they too married into the Ojibwe people and other First Nations in this region. Their mixed-race descendants were generally English- speaking and were sometimes known as the \\"country born\\" (also as Anglo-M√©tis). The third group of settlers to the region were a small number of Presbyterian Scottish settlers. More Anglophone Protestants began to settle there from Ontario in the 19th century. The newer settlers were generally insensitive to M√©tis culture and hostile to Roman Catholicism, and many advocated Canadian expansionism. At the same time, many Americans migrated there, some of whom favored annexation of the territory by the United States. Against this backdrop of religious, nationalistic, and ethnic tensions, political uncertainty was high. To forestall United States expansionism and bring law and order to the wild, the British and Canadian governments had been for some time negotiating the transfer of Rupert's Land from the Hudson's Bay Company to Canada. The Rupert's Land Act 1868 authorized the transfer. On December 1, 1869, Canada purchased the territory. In anticipation of the transfer, the minister of public works, William McDougall, who along with George-√âtienne Cartier had been instrumental in securing Rupert's Land for Canada, ordered a survey party to the Red River Colony. Catholic Bishop Tach√©, the Anglican bishop of Rupert's land Robert Machray, and the HBC governor of Assiniboia William Mactavish all warned the federal government that such surveys would precipitate unrest. Headed by Colonel John Stoughton Dennis, the survey party arrived at Fort Garry on August 20, 1869. The M√©tis were anxious about it, as they did not possess clear title to their lands but held a tenuous right of occupancy. In addition, the lots had been laid out according to the French seigneurial colonial system, with long, narrow lots fronting the river, rather than the square lots preferred by the English. The M√©tis considered the survey to be a forerunner of increased Canadian migration to the territory, which they perceived as a threat to their way of life -- more specifically, they feared to lose their farms. The larger fear was for losing their language and Catholic religion, and facing marginalization and discrimination in their homeland.  Riel emerges as a leader  Louis Riel in 1884 The Canadian government appointed the notoriously anti-French McDougall as the Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories-designate on September 28, 1869, in anticipation of a formal transfer to take effect on December 1. This increased tensions among the M√©tis. In July 1869, the Metis suspicions had increased when McDougall ordered a survey of the settlement. Emerging as a leader, Louis Riel, who had been formally educated in European-style schools, denounced the survey in a speech delivered in late August from the steps of Saint Boniface Cathedral. His lifestyle was very different from those of buffalo-hunting Metis. When Riel returned to the west, it was apparent that MacDonald fearing the United States was negotiating with HBC for the transfer Rupert‚Äôs land without consulting the Red River population and the Council of Assiniboia. On October 11, 1869, Riel and other M√©tis disrupted the survey's work. On October 16 this group organized the \\"M√©tis National Committee\\" to represent M√©tis interests. Riel was elected secretary, John Bruce as president, and two representatives were elected from each parish. There were originally two resistance groups in Red River. One was led by Riel, while the other was led by a Metis named William Dease. Dease expressed the Metis values in his oppositions. For a long time, they were locked in a power struggle. The struggle was on a symbolic level, in while the two sides offered different perspectives on Metis unity. It wasn‚Äôt until Riel had defeated Dease for the leadership of the resistance and consolidated his support system within the French Metis community that he felt strong enough to initiate the breach of October 1869. Because the Hudson's Bay Company's Council of Assiniboia still had authority over the area, its representatives summoned Riel on October 25 to explain the actions of the committee. On October 30, McDougall had reached the border despite the written order from Riel. Riel declared that any attempt by McDougall to enter the Red River Colony would be blocked unless the Canadians first negotiated terms with the M√©tis and with the general population of the settlement. On November 2 under the command of Ambroise- Dydime L√©pine, the M√©tis turned back McDougall's party near the United States border and forced them to retreat to Pembina, Dakota Territory. The number of Riel's followers had grown rapidly. That same day Riel led about 400, who were recruited from the fur-brigades who had recently returned to the settlement for the season, in seizing Fort Garry without bloodshed. This would come to be known as one of Riel's most brilliant moves, as control of the fort symbolized control of all access to the settlement and the northwest. Residents of the Red River Colony disagreed over how to negotiate with Canada; in particular, the French- and English-speaking inhabitants did not have a consensus on how to proceed. In a conciliatory gesture, Riel on November 6 asked the Anglophones to select delegates from each of their parishes to attend a convention with the M√©tis representatives. After few accomplishments at the first meeting, James Ross expressed displeasure at Riel's treatment of McDougall. Riel angrily denied this. It was then that he also stated that he had no intentions of invoking American interventions, and instead throughout the entire resistance he insisted that he and the Metis were loyal subjects of the queen. On November 16, the Council of Assiniboia made a final attempt to assert its authority when Governor Mactavish issued a proclamation ordering the M√©tis to lay down their arms. Instead, on November 23 Riel proposed the formation of a provisional government to replace the council of Assiniboia to enter into direct negotiations with Canada. The Anglophone delegates requested an adjournment to discuss matters. They did not succeed in rallying the English-speaking parishes behind this move. Nor did they originally approve of the ‚ÄúList of Rights‚Äù, which was presented to the convention on December 1, after McDougall‚Äôs proclamation. Despite his M√©tis sympathies, Governor Mactavish did not do enough to end the conflict, and was imprisoned by Riel shortly after. On December 1, McDougall proclaimed that the Hudson's Bay Company was no longer in control of Rupert's Land and that he was the new lieutenant-governor. This proclamation was to later prove problematic, as it effectively ended the authority of the Council while failing to establish Canadian authority. Unbeknownst to McDougall, the transfer had been postponed once news of the unrest reached Ottawa. Near the middle of December 1869, Riel presented the convention with a list of 14 rights as a condition of union. These included representation in Parliament, a bilingual legislature and chief justice, and recognition of certain land claims. While the convention did not adopt the list at the time, once the list of rights was generally known, the majority of Anglophones accepted most of the demands as reasonable. While much of the settlement was moving toward the M√©tis point of view, a passionately pro-Canadian minority was becoming more resistant. It was loosely organized as the Canadian Party and led by Dr. John Christian Schultz and Charles Mair. Colonel Dennis and Major Charles Boulton also supported it. McDougall appointed Dennis to raise a militia to arrest the M√©tis who were occupying Upper Fort Garry. The Anglophone settlers largely ignored this call to arms, and Dennis withdrew to Lower Fort Garry. Schultz, however, was emboldened to fortify his house and store and attracted approximately 50 recruits. Riel took the threat seriously and ordered Schultz's home surrounded. The resisters surrendered on December 7 and were imprisoned in Fort Garry. Given the unrest and absence of a clear authority, the M√©tis National Committee declared a provisional government on December 8. Having received notification of the delay in the union until the British government of the HBC could guarantee a peaceful transfer, McDougall and Dennis departed for Ontario on December 18. Major Boulton fled to Portage la Prairie.  Provisional government  The M√©tis provisional government In Ottawa, the Governor General Lord Lisgar had, at Macdonald's behest, proclaimed an amnesty on December 6 for all in the Red River area who would lay down their arms. He dispatched the Abb√© Jean-Baptiste Thibault and Charles-Ren√© d'Irumberry de Salaberry on a mission of reconciliation, but failed to give them the authority to negotiate on behalf of the Government. Macdonald appointed HBC representative Donald Alexander Smith as special commissioner with greater authority to negotiate. On December 27, John Bruce resigned as president of the provisional government, and Riel was elected president. On the same day, Donald Smith arrived in the settlement, followed shortly by de Salaberry, joining Thibault, who had arrived on Christmas Day. They met with Riel on January 5, 1870, but reached no conclusions. The next day, Riel and Smith had another meeting. At this time Smith concluded that negotiation with the committee would be fruitless. He maneuvered to bypass them and present the Canadian position at a public meeting. Meetings were held on January 19 and January 20. With Riel acting as translator, Smith assured the large audiences of the Canadian government's goodwill, intention to grant representation, and willingness to extend concessions with respect to land claims. With the settlement now solidly behind him, Riel proposed the formation of a new convention of forty representatives, split evenly between French- and English-speaking settlers, to consider Smith's instructions. This was accepted. A committee of six outlined a more comprehensive list of rights, which the convention accepted on February 3. Following meetings on February 7 wherein the new list of rights were presented to Thibault, de Salaberry, and Smith, Smith proposed that a delegation be sent to Ottawa to engage in direct negotiations with Canada, a suggestion eagerly accepted by Riel. At this time Riel also proposed that the provisional government should be reformed so as to be more inclusive of both language groups. A constitution enshrining these goals was accepted by the convention on February 10. An elected assembly was established, consisting of 12 representatives from anglophone parishes and 12 representatives from francophone parishes.  Canadian resistance and the execution of Scott  Despite the progress on the political front and the inclusion of Anglophones within the provisional government, the Canadian contingent was not yet silenced. On January 9 many prisoners escaped from the prison at Fort Garry, including Charles Mair, Thomas Scott and ten others. John Schultz escaped on January 23. By February 15, Riel freed the remaining prisoners on parole to refrain from engaging in political agitation. Schultz, Mair, and Scott intended to continue to work to depose the M√©tis from power. An artist's depiction of the execution of Scott, 1870 Mair and Scott proceeded to the Canadian settlements surrounding Portage la Prairie, where they met Boulton, while Schultz sought recruits in the Canadian parishes downstream. On February 12, Boulton led a party from Portage la Prairie to rendezvous at Kildonan with Schultz's men. They intended to overthrow the provisional government. Boulton had misgivings, and turned the party back. Riel's forces detected the men, and on February 17, Boulton, Scott and 46 other men were captured near Fort Garry. On hearing this news, Schultz and Mair fled to Ontario. Riel demanded that an example be made of Boulton. He was tried and sentenced to death for his interference with the provisional government. Intercessions on his behalf by Donald Smith and others resulted in his pardon, but only after Riel obtained assurances from Smith that he would persuade the English parishes to elect provisional representatives. However, the prisoner Thomas Scott, an Orangeman, interpreted Boulton's pardon as weakness on the part of the M√©tis, whom he regarded with open contempt. After he repeatedly quarreled with his guards, they insisted that he be tried for insubordination. At his trial, which was overseen by Ambroise-Dydime L√©pine, he was found guilty of insulting the president, defying the authority of the provisional government, and fighting with his guards. He was sentenced to death despite the fact that these were not considered capital crimes at the time. Smith and Boulton asked Riel to commute the sentence, but Smith reported that Riel responded to his pleas by saying :\\"I have done three good things since I have commenced; I have spared Boulton's life at your instance, I pardoned Gaddy, and now I shall shoot Scott.\\" Scott was executed by a firing squad on March 4, 1870. Historians have debated Riel's motivations for allowing the execution, as they consider it his one great political blunder. His own justification was that he felt it necessary to demonstrate to the Canadians that the M√©tis must be taken seriously.  Creation of Manitoba  Canada after the creation of Manitoba by the Manitoba Act of 1870 Upon receiving news of the unrest, Bishop Tach√© was recalled from Rome. He arrived back in the colony on March 8, whereupon he conveyed to Riel his mistaken impression that the December amnesty would apply to both Riel and L√©pine. On March 15 he read to the elected assembly a telegram from Joseph Howe indicating that the government found the demands in the list of rights to be \\" in the main satisfactory\\". Following the preparation of a final list of rights, which included new demands such as a general amnesty for all members of the provisional government and provisions for separate francophone schools, delegates Abb√© Joseph-No√´l Ritchot, Judge John Black and Alfred Henry Scott departed for Ottawa on March 23 and 24. Shortly after this, Mair and Schultz arrived in Toronto, Ontario. Assisted by George Taylor Denison III, they immediately set about inflaming anti-M√©tis and anti-Catholic sentiment in the editorial pages of the Ontario press over the execution of Scott. But, Macdonald had decided before the provisional government was established that Canada must negotiate with the M√©tis. Although the delegates were arrested following their arrival in Ottawa on April 11 on charges of abetting murder, they were quickly released. They soon entered into direct talks with Macdonald and Cartier, wherein Ritchot emerged as an effective negotiator; an agreement enshrining many of the demands in the list of rights was soon reached. This formed the basis for the Manitoba Act of May 12, 1870, which admitted Manitoba into the Canadian confederation on July 15. The government had to deal with several issues before peace could be made, fortunately for the government, they would reach an agreement. With the creation of Manitoba, the government would gain control over a new area and not have to worry about the Metis being upset as they would also be gaining control over the land. On May 12, 1870, the Metis had been given two hundred thousand hectares of land which would make up the province of Manitoba. This would allow for the Metis to hunt freely in their land and have some form of government with legitimate powers to run the province and protect the Metis rights. Even though the government had created the province of Manitoba for the Metis, it also allowed the government to have control over the province without being responsible for any events that may occur within the province. Manitoba would be the first province created from the Northwest Territories. Significantly, however, Ritchot could not secure a clarification of the Governor General's amnesty -- anger over Scott's execution was growing rapidly in Ontario, and any such guarantee was not politically expedient. The delegates returned to Manitoba with only a promise of a forthcoming amnesty.  The Wolseley expedition  The Red River Expedition at Kakabeka Falls, by Frances Anne Hopkins, 1877. A military expedition had in any case been decided on as a means of exercising Canadian authority in the Red River settlement and dissuading the Minnesota expansionists: in May it embarked, under Colonel Garnet Wolseley, and made its way up the Great Lakes. Ontarians especially believed the Wolseley Expedition was intended to suppress the rebellion, although the government described it as an \\"errand of peace\\". Knowing he would be arrested and charged with criminal acts, and believing that members of the Canadian militia in the expedition meant to lynch him, Riel and his followers fled hurriedly when the troops arrived unexpectedly at Fort Garry on August 24 in pouring rain.Wallace, Nesbitt Willougby. The Rebellion in the Red River Settlement (Peel's Prairie Provinces website), p. 29 The arrival of the expedition at Fort Garry marked the effective end of the Red River Rebellion.  Legacy  The Red River resistance was described as a rebellion only after sentiment grew in Ontario against the execution of Thomas Scott. Historian A. G. Morice suggests that the phrase \\"Red River Rebellion\\" owes its persistence to alliteration, a quality that made it attractive for publication in newspaper headlines (Critical History of The Red River Insurrection [1935]). In 1875, Riel was formally exiled from Canada for five years. Under pressure from Quebec, the government of Sir John A. Macdonald took no more vigorous action. Riel was elected to the Canadian parliament three times while in exile, but never took his seat. He returned to Canada in 1885 to lead the ill- fated North-West Rebellion. He was subsequently tried and convicted for high treason and executed by hanging.  In popular culture Canadian folk singer- writer James Keelaghan wrote a song \\"Red River Rising\\" about the Red River Rebellion.

The attitudes were first formulated in the form of the ten rules of Jante Law by the Dano-Norwegian author Aksel Sandemose in his satirical novel A Fugitive Crosses His Tracks (, 1933), but the actual attitudes themselves are older. Sandemose portrays the fictional small Danish town of Jante, which he modeled upon his native town Nyk√∏bing Mors in the 1930s, where nobody was anonymous, a feature of life typical of all small towns and communities.Translator note, En flygtning krydser sit spor, 2nd ed. Used generally in colloquial speech in the Nordic countries as a sociological term to denote a social attitude of disapproval towards expressions of individuality and personal success, it emphasizes adherence to the collective.  Definition  There are ten rules in the law as defined by Sandemose, all expressive of variations on a single theme and usually referred to as a homogeneous unit: You are not to think you're anyone special, or that you're better than us. Janteloven written by Aksel Sandemose The ten rules state: # You're not to think you are anything special. # You're not to think you are as good as we are. # You're not to think you are smarter than we are. # You're not to imagine yourself better than we are. # You're not to think you know more than we do. # You're not to think you are more important than we are. # You're not to think you are good at anything. # You're not to laugh at us. # You're not to think anyone cares about you. # You're not to think you can teach us anything. The Janters who transgress this unwritten 'law' are regarded with suspicion and some hostility, as it goes against the town's communal desire to preserve harmony, social stability, and uniformity. An eleventh rule recognized in the novel as 'the penal code of Jante' is: 11. Perhaps you don't think we know a few things about you? From the chapter \\"Maybe you don't think I know something about you\\": > That one sentence (the eleventh rule), which acts as the penal code of > Jante, as such was rich in content. It was a charge of all sorts of things, > and that it also had to be, because absolutely nothing was allowed. It was > also an elaborate indictment, with all kinds of unspecified penalties given > to be expected. Furthermore it was useful, depending fully on tone of voice, > in financial extortion and enticement into criminal acts, and it could also > be the best means of defense. Sandemose's novel described working-class life in the fictional town of Jante. He wrote in 1955, a bit mischievously, that \\"Many people have recognized [in Jante] their own hometown - this has happened regularly to people from Arendal [Norway], Troms√∏ [Norway] and Viborg [Denmark]\\".English translation of passage from foreword of the Norwegian edition (1999), p. 14. Sandemose made no claim to having invented the rules; he simply sought to formulate social norms that had stamped the Danish and Norwegian psyches for centuries.  Sociological effects  Although intended as criticism of society in general, the meaning of the Law of Jante has shifted to refer to personal criticism of people who want to break out of their social groups and reach a higher position. It is common in Scandinavia to claim the Law of Jante as something quintessentially Danish, Norwegian or Swedish. The rules are treated as a way of behaving in order to fit in and results in dressing similarly and the types of cars that people buy and buying similar products for their homes. It's commonly stated that Jante Law is for people in the provinces, but commentators have suggested that metropolitan areas are also affected. While the original intention was as satire, Kim Orlin Kantardjiev, a Norwegian politicianAgenda Magasin online and educational advisor claims that the Law of Jante is taught in schools as more of a social code to encourage group behavior, and wants to credit it with fueling Nordic countries' high happiness scores.BBC Ideas Forget hygge: The laws that really rule in Scandinavia It has also been suggested that contentedness with a humdrum lifestyle is a part of happiness in the Scandinavian countries. However, in Scandinavia, there have also been articles which link the Law of Jante to high suicide rates.Klas Leffler in MittMedia Allehanda V√§sternorrland 2016-07-16 Backlash has occurred against the rules, and in Norway someone even placed a grave for Jante Laws, declaring them dead in 2005. However, others have questioned whether they will ever go away, as they may be firmly entrenched in society.

The most common sign of infection is an expanding red rash, known as erythema migrans, that appears at the site of the tick bite about a week after it occurred. The rash is typically neither itchy nor painful. Approximately 70‚Äì80% of infected people develop a rash. Other early symptoms may include fever, headache and tiredness. If untreated, symptoms may include loss of the ability to move one or both sides of the face, joint pains, severe headaches with neck stiffness, or heart palpitations, among others. Months to years later, repeated episodes of joint pain and swelling may occur. Occasionally, people develop shooting pains or tingling in their arms and legs. Despite appropriate treatment, about 10 to 20% of people develop joint pains, memory problems, and tiredness for at least six months. Lyme disease is transmitted to humans by the bites of infected ticks of the genus Ixodes. In the United States, ticks of concern are usually of the Ixodes scapularis type, and must be attached for at least 36 hours before the bacteria can spread. In Europe, ticks of the Ixodes ricinus type may spread the bacteria more quickly. In North America, the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi and Borrelia mayonii cause Lyme disease. In Europe and Asia, Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii are also causes of the disease. The disease does not appear to be transmissible between people, by other animals, or through food. Diagnosis is based upon a combination of symptoms, history of tick exposure, and possibly testing for specific antibodies in the blood. Blood tests are often negative in the early stages of the disease. Testing of individual ticks is not typically useful. Prevention includes efforts to prevent tick bites such as by wearing clothing to cover the arms and legs, and using DEET-based insect repellents. Using pesticides to reduce tick numbers may also be effective. Ticks can be removed using tweezers. If the removed tick was full of blood, a single dose of doxycycline may be used to prevent development of infection, but is not generally recommended since development of infection is rare. If an infection develops, a number of antibiotics are effective, including doxycycline, amoxicillin, and cefuroxime. Standard treatment usually lasts for two or three weeks. Some people develop a fever and muscle and joint pains from treatment which may last for one or two days. In those who develop persistent symptoms, long-term antibiotic therapy has not been found to be useful. Lyme disease is the most common disease spread by ticks in the Northern Hemisphere. It is estimated to affect 300,000 people a year in the United States and 65,000 people a year in Europe. Infections are most common in the spring and early summer. Lyme disease was diagnosed as a separate condition for the first time in 1975 in Old Lyme, Connecticut. It was originally mistaken for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The bacterium involved was first described in 1981 by Willy Burgdorfer. Chronic symptoms following treatment are well described and are known as \\"post- treatment Lyme disease syndrome\\" (PTLDS). PTLDS is different from chronic Lyme disease; a term no longer supported by the scientific community and used in different ways by different groups. Some healthcare providers claim that PTLDS is caused by persistent infection, but this is not believed to be true because no evidence of persistent infection can be found after standard treatment. A vaccine for Lyme disease was marketed in the United States between 1998 and 2002, but was withdrawn from the market due to poor sales. Research is ongoing to develop new vaccines. Signs and symptoms expanding rash is an initial sign of about 80% of Lyme infections. The rash may look like a \\"bull's eye\\", as pictured, in about 80% of cases in Europe and 20% of cases in the US. Lyme disease can affect multiple body systems and produce a broad range of symptoms. Not everyone with Lyme disease has all of the symptoms, and many of the symptoms are not specific to Lyme disease but can occur with other diseases, as well. The incubation period from infection to the onset of symptoms is usually one to two weeks, but can be much shorter (days), or much longer (months to years). Lyme symptoms most often occur from May to September, because the nymphal stage of the tick is responsible for most cases. Asymptomatic infection exists, but occurs in less than 7% of infected individuals in the United States. Asymptomatic infection may be much more common among those infected in Europe. =Early localized infection= Early localized infection can occur when the infection has not yet spread throughout the body. Only the site where the infection has first come into contact with the skin is affected. The initial sign of about 80% of Lyme infections is an Erythema migrans (EM) rash at the site of a tick bite, often near skin folds, such as the armpit, groin, or back of knee, on the trunk, under clothing straps, or in children's hair, ear, or neck. Most people who get infected do not remember seeing a tick or the bite. The rash appears typically one or two weeks (range 3‚Äì32 days) after the bite and expands 2‚Äì3 cm per day up to a diameter of 5‚Äì70 cm (median 16 cm). The rash is usually circular or oval, red or bluish, and may have an elevated or darker center. In about 79% of cases in Europe but only 19% of cases in endemic areas of the U.S., the rash gradually clears from the center toward the edges, possibly forming a \\"bull's eye\\" pattern. The rash may feel warm but usually is not itchy, is rarely tender or painful, and takes up to four weeks to resolve if untreated. The EM (Erythema migrans) rash is often accompanied by symptoms of a viral-like illness, including fatigue, headache, body aches, fever, and chills, but usually not nausea or upper-respiratory problems. These symptoms may also appear without a rash, or linger after the rash disappears. Lyme can progress to later stages without these symptoms or a rash. People with high fever for more than two days or whose other symptoms of viral-like illness do not improve despite antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease, or who have abnormally low levels of white or red cells or platelets in the blood, should be investigated for possible coinfection with other tick-borne diseases, such as ehrlichiosis and babesiosis. =Early disseminated infection= Within days to weeks after the onset of local infection, the Borrelia bacteria may spread through the lymphatic system or bloodstream. In 10-20% of untreated cases, EM rashes develop at sites across the body that bear no relation to the original tick bite. Transient muscle pains and joint pains are also common. In about 10-15% of untreated people, Lyme causes neurological problems known as neuroborreliosis. Early neuroborreliosis typically appears 4‚Äì6 weeks (range 1‚Äì12 weeks) after the tick bite and involves some combination of lymphocytic meningitis, cranial neuritis, radiculopathy and/or mononeuritis multiplex. Lymphocytic meningitis causes characteristic changes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and may be accompanied for several weeks by variable headache and, less commonly, usually mild meningitis signs such as inability to flex the neck fully and intolerance to bright lights, but typically no or only very low fever. In children, partial loss of vision may also occur. Cranial neuritis is an inflammation of cranial nerves. When due to Lyme, it most typically causes facial palsy impairing blinking, smiling, and chewing in one or both sides of the face. It may also cause intermittent double vision. Lyme radiculopathy is an inflammation of spinal nerve roots that often causes pain and less often weakness, numbness, or altered sensation in the areas of the body served by nerves connected to the affected roots, e.g. limb(s) or part(s) of trunk. The pain is often described as unlike any other previously felt, excruciating, migrating, worse at night, rarely symmetrical, and often accompanied by extreme sleep disturbance. Mononeuritis multiplex is an inflammation causing similar symptoms in one or more unrelated peripheral nerves. Rarely, early neuroborreliosis may involve inflammation of the brain or spinal cord, with symptoms such as confusion, abnormal gait, ocular movements, or speech, impaired movement, impaired motor planning, or shaking. In North America, facial palsy is the typical early neuroborreliosis presentation, occurring in 5-10% of untreated people, in about 75% of cases accompanied by lymphocytic meningitis. Lyme radiculopathy is reported half as frequently, but many cases may be unrecognized. In European adults, the most common presentation is a combination of lymphocytic meningitis and radiculopathy known as Bannwarth syndrome, accompanied in 36-89% of cases by facial palsy. In this syndrome, radicular pain tends to start in the same body region as the initial erythema migrans rash, if there was one, and precedes possible facial palsy and other impaired movement. In extreme cases, permanent impairment of motor or sensory function of the lower limbs may occur. In European children, the most common manifestations are facial palsy (in 55%), other cranial neuritis, and lymphocytic meningitis (in 27%). In about 4-10% of untreated cases in the U.S. and 0.3-4% of untreated cases in Europe, typically between June and December, about one month (range 4 days-7 months) after the tick bite, the infection may cause heart complications known as Lyme carditis. Symptoms may include heart palpitations (in 69% of people), dizziness, fainting, shortness of breath, and chest pain. Other symptoms of Lyme disease may also be present, such as EM rash, joint aches, facial palsy, headaches, or radicular pain. In some people, however, carditis may be the first manifestation of Lyme disease. Lyme carditis in 19-87% of people adversely impacts the heart's electrical conduction system, causing atrioventricular block that often manifests as heart rhythms that alternate within minutes between abnormally slow and abnormally fast. In 10-15% of people, Lyme causes myocardial complications such as cardiomegaly, left ventricular dysfunction, or congestive heart failure. Another skin condition, found in Europe but not in North America, is borrelial lymphocytoma, a purplish lump that develops on the ear lobe, nipple, or scrotum. = Late disseminated infection= After several months, untreated or inadequately treated people may go on to develop chronic symptoms that affect many parts of the body, including the joints, nerves, brain, eyes, and heart. Lyme arthritis occurs in up to 60% of untreated people, typically starting about six months after infection. It usually affects only one or a few joints, often a knee or possibly the hip, other large joints, or the temporomandibular joint. There is usually large joint effusion and swelling, but only mild or moderate pain. Without treatment, swelling and pain typically resolve over time but periodically return. Baker's cysts may form and rupture. In some cases, joint erosion occurs. Chronic neurologic symptoms occur in up to 5% of untreated people. A peripheral neuropathy or polyneuropathy may develop, causing abnormal sensations such as numbness, tingling or burning starting at the feet or hands and over time possibly moving up the limbs. A test may show reduced sensation of vibrations in the feet. An affected person may feel as if wearing a stocking or glove without actually doing so. A neurologic syndrome called Lyme encephalopathy is associated with subtle memory and cognitive difficulties, insomnia, a general sense of feeling unwell, and changes in personality. However, problems such as depression and fibromyalgia are as common in people with Lyme disease as in the general population. Lyme can cause a chronic encephalomyelitis that resembles multiple sclerosis. It may be progressive and can involve cognitive impairment, brain fog, migraines, balance issues, weakness in the legs, awkward gait, facial palsy, bladder problems, vertigo, and back pain. In rare cases, untreated Lyme disease may cause frank psychosis, which has been misdiagnosed as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Panic attacks and anxiety can occur; also, delusional behavior may be seen, including somatoform delusions, sometimes accompanied by a depersonalization or derealization syndrome, where the people begin to feel detached from themselves or from reality. Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA) is a chronic skin disorder observed primarily in Europe among the elderly. ACA begins as a reddish-blue patch of discolored skin, often on the backs of the hands or feet. The lesion slowly atrophies over several weeks or months, with the skin becoming first thin and wrinkled and then, if untreated, completely dry and hairless. Cause Deer tick life cycle Borrelia bacteria, the causative agent of Lyme disease, magnified Ixodes scapularis, the primary vector of Lyme disease in eastern North America Tick Ixodes ricinus, developmental stages Lyme disease is caused by spirochetes, spiral bacteria from the genus Borrelia. Spirochetes are surrounded by peptidoglycan and flagella, along with an outer membrane similar to Gram- negative bacteria. Because of their double-membrane envelope, Borrelia bacteria are often mistakenly described as Gram negative despite the considerable differences in their envelope components from Gram-negative bacteria. The Lyme-related Borrelia species are collectively known as Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, and show a great deal of genetic diversity. B. burgdorferi sensu lato is made up of 21 closely related species, but only four clearly cause Lyme disease: B. mayonii (found in North America), B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (predominant in North America, but also present in Europe), B. afzelii, and B. garinii (both predominant in Eurasia). Some studies have also proposed that B. bissettii and B. valaisiana may sometimes infect humans, but these species do not seem to be important causes of disease. =Transmission= Lyme disease is classified as a zoonosis, as it is transmitted to humans from a natural reservoir among small mammals and birds by ticks that feed on both sets of hosts. Hard-bodied ticks of the genus Ixodes are the main vectors of Lyme disease (also the vector for Babesia). Most infections are caused by ticks in the nymphal stage, because they are very small and thus may feed for long periods of time undetected. Nymphal ticks are generally the size of a poppy seed and sometimes with a dark head and a translucent body.2005 Fact Sheet, Prevent Tick Bites: Prevent Lyme Disease , Rutgers University, Rutgers Cooperative Research & Extension, New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station, Deborah Smith-Fiola, Former Ocean County Agricultural Agent and George C. Hamilton, Ph.D., Extension Specialist in Pest Management, March 2005. Or, the nymphal ticks can be darker.People are freaking out over the CDC's photo of a muffin with ticks in it , Deseret News (Utah), Herb Scribner, May 31, 2019. The U.S. CDC published a picture of a poppy seed muffin in which some of the \\"poppy seeds\\" were actually ticks. (The younger larval ticks are very rarely infected.) Although deer are the preferred hosts of adult deer ticks, and tick populations are much lower in the absence of deer, ticks generally do not acquire Borrelia from deer, instead they obtain them from infected small mammals such as the white-footed mouse, and occasionally birds. Areas where Lyme is common are expanding. Within the tick midgut, the Borrelias outer surface protein A (OspA) binds to the tick receptor for OspA, known as TROSPA. When the tick feeds, the Borrelia downregulates OspA and upregulates OspC, another surface protein. After the bacteria migrate from the midgut to the salivary glands, OspC binds to Salp15, a tick salivary protein that appears to have immunosuppressive effects that enhance infection. Successful infection of the mammalian host depends on bacterial expression of OspC. Tick bites often go unnoticed because of the small size of the tick in its nymphal stage, as well as tick secretions that prevent the host from feeling any itch or pain from the bite. However, transmission is quite rare, with only about 1.2 to 1.4 percent of recognized tick bites resulting in Lyme disease. In Europe, the vector is Ixodes ricinus, which is also called the sheep tick or castor bean tick. In China, Ixodes persulcatus (the taiga tick) is probably the most important vector. In North America, the black-legged tick or deer tick (Ixodes scapularis) is the main vector on the East Coast. The lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum), which is found throughout the Southeastern United States as far west as Texas, is unlikely to transmit the Lyme disease spirochetes, though it may be implicated in a related syndrome called southern tick-associated rash illness, which resembles a mild form of Lyme disease. On the West Coast of the United States, the main vector is the western black-legged tick (Ixodes pacificus). The tendency of this tick species to feed predominantly on host species such as the Western Fence Lizard that are resistant to Borrelia infection appears to diminish transmission of Lyme disease in the West. Transmission can occur across the placenta during pregnancy and as with a number of other spirochetal diseases, adverse pregnancy outcomes are possible with untreated infection; prompt treatment with antibiotics reduces or eliminates this risk. While Lyme spirochetes have been found in insects, as well as ticks, reports of actual infectious transmission appear to be rare. Lyme spirochete DNA has been found in semen and breast milk. However, according to the CDC, live spirochetes have not been found in breast milk, urine, or semen and thus is not sexually transmitted. =Tick-borne coinfections= Ticks that transmit B. burgdorferi to humans can also carry and transmit several other parasites, such as Theileria microti and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, which cause the diseases babesiosis and human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), respectively. Among people with early Lyme disease, depending on their location, 2‚Äì12% will also have HGA and 2‚Äì40% will have babesiosis. Ticks in certain regions, including the lands along the eastern Baltic Sea, also transmit tick-borne encephalitis. Coinfections complicate Lyme symptoms, especially diagnosis and treatment. It is possible for a tick to carry and transmit one of the coinfections and not Borrelia, making diagnosis difficult and often elusive. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention studied 100 ticks in rural New Jersey, and found 55% of the ticks were infected with at least one of the pathogens. Pathophysiology B. burgdorferi can spread throughout the body during the course of the disease, and has been found in the skin, heart, joints, peripheral nervous system, and central nervous system. Many of the signs and symptoms of Lyme disease are a consequence of the immune response to spirochete in those tissues. B. burgdorferi is injected into the skin by the bite of an infected Ixodes tick. Tick saliva, which accompanies the spirochete into the skin during the feeding process, contains substances that disrupt the immune response at the site of the bite. This provides a protective environment where the spirochete can establish infection. The spirochetes multiply and migrate outward within the dermis. The host inflammatory response to the bacteria in the skin causes the characteristic circular EM lesion. Neutrophils, however, which are necessary to eliminate the spirochetes from the skin, fail to appear in necessary numbers in the developing EM lesion, mostly due to the fact that tick saliva also inhibits neutrophil function. This allows the bacteria to survive and eventually spread throughout the body. Days to weeks following the tick bite, the spirochetes spread via the bloodstream to joints, heart, nervous system, and distant skin sites, where their presence gives rise to the variety of symptoms of the disseminated disease. The spread of B. burgdorferi is aided by the attachment of the host protease plasmin to the surface of the spirochete. If untreated, the bacteria may persist in the body for months or even years, despite the production of B. burgdorferi antibodies by the immune system. The spirochetes may avoid the immune response by decreasing expression of surface proteins that are targeted by antibodies, antigenic variation of the VlsE surface protein, inactivating key immune components such as complement, and hiding in the extracellular matrix, which may interfere with the function of immune factors. In the brain, B. burgdorferi may induce astrocytes to undergo astrogliosis (proliferation followed by apoptosis), which may contribute to neurodysfunction. The spirochetes may also induce host cells to secrete quinolinic acid, which stimulates the NMDA receptor on nerve cells, which may account for the fatigue and malaise observed with Lyme encephalopathy. In addition, diffuse white matter pathology during Lyme encephalopathy may disrupt gray matter connections, and could account for deficits in attention, memory, visuospatial ability, complex cognition, and emotional status. White matter disease may have a greater potential for recovery than gray matter disease, perhaps because the neuronal loss is less common. Resolution of MRI white matter hyperintensities after antibiotic treatment has been observed. Tryptophan, a precursor to serotonin, appears to be reduced within the central nervous system in a number of infectious diseases that affect the brain, including Lyme. Researchers are investigating if this neurohormone secretion is the cause of neuropsychiatric disorders developing in some people with borreliosis. =Immunological studies= Exposure to the Borrelia bacterium during Lyme disease possibly causes a long-lived and damaging inflammatory response, a form of pathogen-induced autoimmune disease. The production of this reaction might be due to a form of molecular mimicry, where Borrelia avoids being killed by the immune system by resembling normal parts of the body's tissues. Chronic symptoms from an autoimmune reaction could explain why some symptoms persist even after the spirochetes have been eliminated from the body. This hypothesis may explain why chronic arthritis persists after antibiotic therapy, similar to rheumatic fever, but its wider application is controversial. Diagnosis Lyme disease is diagnosed based on symptoms, objective physical findings (such as erythema migrans (EM) rash, facial palsy, or arthritis), history of possible exposure to infected ticks, and possibly laboratory tests. People with symptoms of early Lyme disease should have a total body skin examination for EM rashes and asked whether EM-type rashes had manifested within the last 1‚Äì2 months. Presence of an EM rash and recent tick exposure (i.e., being outdoors in a likely tick habitat where Lyme is common, within 30 days of the appearance of the rash) are sufficient for Lyme diagnosis; no laboratory confirmation is needed or recommended. Most people who get infected do not remember a tick or a bite, and the EM rash need not look like a bull's eye (most EM rashes in the U.S. do not) or be accompanied by any other symptoms. In the U.S., Lyme is most common in the New England and Mid-Atlantic states and parts of Wisconsin and Minnesota, but it is expanding into other areas. Several bordering areas of Canada also have high Lyme risk. In the absence of an EM rash or history of tick exposure, Lyme diagnosis depends on laboratory confirmation. The bacteria that cause Lyme disease are difficult to observe directly in body tissues and also difficult and too time- consuming to grow in the laboratory. The most widely used tests look instead for presence of antibodies against those bacteria in the blood. A positive antibody test result does not by itself prove active infection, but can confirm an infection that is suspected because of symptoms, objective findings, and history of tick exposure in a person. Because as many as 5-20% of the normal population have antibodies against Lyme, people without history and symptoms suggestive of Lyme disease should not be tested for Lyme antibodies: a positive result would likely be false, possibly causing unnecessary treatment. In some cases, when history, signs, and symptoms are strongly suggestive of early disseminated Lyme disease, empiric treatment may be started and reevaluated as laboratory test results become available. =Laboratory testing= Tests for antibodies in the blood by ELISA and Western blot is the most widely used method for Lyme diagnosis. A two-tiered protocol is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): the sensitive ELISA test is performed first, and if it is positive or equivocal, then the more specific Western blot is run. The immune system takes some time to produce antibodies in quantity. After Lyme infection onset, antibodies of types IgM and IgG usually can first be detected respectively at 2‚Äì4 weeks and 4‚Äì6 weeks, and peak at 6‚Äì8 weeks. When an EM rash first appears, detectable antibodies may not be present. Therefore, it is recommended that testing not be performed and diagnosis be based on the presence of the EM rash. Up to 30 days after suspected Lyme infection onset, infection can be confirmed by detection of IgM or IgG antibodies; after that, it is recommended that only IgG antibodies be considered. A positive IgM and negative IgG test result after the first month of infection is generally indicative of a false positive result. The number of IgM antibodies usually collapses 4‚Äì6 months after infection, while IgG antibodies can remain detectable for years. Other tests may be used in neuroborreliosis cases. In Europe, neuroborreliosis is usually caused by Borrelia garinii and almost always involves lymphocytic pleocytosis, i.e. the densities of lymphocytes (infection-fighting cells) and protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) typically rise to characteristically abnormal levels, while glucose level remains normal. Additionally, the immune system produces antibodies against Lyme inside the intrathecal space, which contains the CSF. Demonstration by lumbar puncture and CSF analysis of pleocytosis and intrathecal antibody production are required for definite diagnosis of neuroborreliosis in Europe (except in cases of peripheral neuropathy associated with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, which usually is caused by Borrelia afzelii and confirmed by blood antibody tests). In North America, neuroborreliosis is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and may not be accompanied by the same CSF signs; they confirm a diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) neuroborreliosis if positive, but do not exclude it if negative. American guidelines consider CSF analysis optional when symptoms appear to be confined to the peripheral nervous system (PNS), e.g. facial palsy without overt meninigitis symptoms. Unlike blood and intrathecal antibody tests, CSF pleocytosis tests revert to normal after infection ends and therefore can be used as objective markers of treatment success and inform decisions on whether to retreat. In infection involving the PNS, electromyography and nerve conduction studies can be used to monitor objectively the response to treatment. In Lyme carditis, electrocardiograms are used to evidence heart conduction abnormalities, while echocardiography may show myocardial dysfunction. Biopsy and confirmation of Borrelia cells in myocardial tissue may be used in specific cases but are usually not done because of risk of the procedure. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for Lyme disease have also been developed to detect the genetic material (DNA) of the Lyme disease spirochete. Culture or PCR are the current means for detecting the presence of the organism, as serologic studies only test for antibodies of Borrelia. PCR has the advantage of being much faster than culture. However, PCR tests are susceptible to false positive results, e.g. by detection of debris of dead Borrelia cells or specimen contamination. Even when properly performed, PCR often shows false negative results because few Borrelia cells can be found in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during infection. Hence, PCR tests are recommended only in special cases, e.g. diagnosis of Lyme arthritis, because it is a highly sensitive way of detecting ospA DNA in synovial fluid. Although sensitivity of PCR in CSF is low, its use may be considered when intrathecal antibody production test results are suspected of being falsely negative, e.g. in very early (< 6 weeks) neuroborreliosis or in immunosuppressed people. Several other forms of laboratory testing for Lyme disease are available, some of which have not been adequately validated. OspA antigens, shed by live Borrelia bacteria into urine, are a promising technique being studied. The use of nanotrap particles for their detection is being looked at and the OspA has been linked to active symptoms of Lyme. High titers of either immunoglobulin G (IgG) or immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to Borrelia antigens indicate disease, but lower titers can be misleading, because the IgM antibodies may remain after the initial infection, and IgG antibodies may remain for years. The CDC does not recommend urine antigen tests, PCR tests on urine, immunofluorescent staining for cell-wall-deficient forms of B. burgdorferi, and lymphocyte transformation tests. =Imaging= Neuroimaging is controversial in whether it provides specific patterns unique to neuroborreliosis, but may aid in differential diagnosis and in understanding the pathophysiology of the disease. Though controversial, some evidence shows certain neuroimaging tests can provide data that are helpful in the diagnosis of a person. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are two of the tests that can identify abnormalities in the brain of a person affected with this disease. Neuroimaging findings in an MRI include lesions in the periventricular white matter, as well as enlarged ventricles and cortical atrophy. The findings are considered somewhat unexceptional because the lesions have been found to be reversible following antibiotic treatment. Images produced using SPECT show numerous areas where an insufficient amount of blood is being delivered to the cortex and subcortical white matter. However, SPECT images are known to be nonspecific because they show a heterogeneous pattern in the imaging. The abnormalities seen in the SPECT images are very similar to those seen in people with cerebral vacuities and Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease, which makes them questionable. =Differential diagnosis= Community clinics have been reported to misdiagnose 23‚Äì28% of Erythema migrans (EM) rashes and 83% of other objective manifestations of early Lyme disease. EM rashes are often misdiagnosed as spider bites, cellulitis, or shingles. Many misdiagnoses are credited to the widespread misconception that EM rashes should look like a bull's eye. Actually, the key distinguishing features of the EM rash are the speed and extent to which it expands, respectively up to 2‚Äì3 cm/day and a diameter of at least 5 cm, and in 50% of cases more than 16 cm. The rash expands away from its center, which may or may not look different or be separated by ring-like clearing from the rest of the rash. Compared to EM rashes, spider bites are more common in the limbs, tend to be more painful and itchy or become swollen, and some may cause necrosis (sinking dark blue patch of dead skin). Cellulitis most commonly develops around a wound or ulcer, is rarely circular, and is more likely to become swollen and tender. EM rashes often appear at sites that are unusual for cellulitis, such as the armpit, groin, abdomen, or back of knee. Like Lyme, shingles often begins with headache, fever, and fatigue, which are followed by pain or numbness. However, unlike Lyme, in shingles these symptoms are usually followed by appearance of rashes composed of multiple small blisters along a nerve's dermatome, and shingles can also be confirmed by quick laboratory tests. Facial palsy caused by Lyme disease (LDFP) is often misdiagnosed as Bell's palsy. Although Bell's palsy is the most common type of one-sided facial palsy (about 70% of cases), LDFP can account for about 25% of cases of facial palsy in areas where Lyme disease is common. Compared to LDFP, Bell's palsy much less frequently affects both sides of the face. Even though LDFP and Bell's palsy have similar symptoms and evolve similarly if untreated, corticosteroid treatment is beneficial for Bell's Palsy, while being detrimental for LDFP. Recent history of exposure to a likely tick habitat during warmer months, EM rash, viral-like symptoms such as headache and fever, and/or palsy in both sides of the face should be evaluated for likelihood of LDFP; if it is more than minimal, empiric therapy with antibiotics should be initiated, without corticosteroids, and reevaluated upon completion of laboratory tests for Lyme disease. Unlike viral meningitis, Lyme lymphocytic meningitis tends to not cause fever, last longer, and recur. Lymphocytic meningitis is also characterized by possibly co-occurring with EM rash, facial palsy, or partial vision obstruction and having much lower percentage of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in CSF. Lyme radiculopathy affecting the limbs is often misdiagnosed as a radiculopathy caused by nerve root compression, such as sciatica. Although most cases of radiculopathy are compressive and resolve with conservative treatment (e.g., rest) within 4‚Äì6 weeks, guidelines for managing radiculopathy recommend first evaluating risks of other possible causes that, although less frequent, require immediate diagnosis and treatment, including infections such as Lyme and shingles. A history of outdoor activities in likely tick habitats in the last 3 months possibly followed by a rash or viral-like symptoms, and current headache, other symptoms of lymphocytic meningitis, or facial palsy would lead to suspicion of Lyme disease and recommendation of serological and lumbar puncture tests for confirmation. Lyme radiculopathy affecting the trunk can be misdiagnosed as myriad other conditions, such as diverticulitis and acute coronary syndrome. Diagnosis of late-stage Lyme disease is often complicated by a multifaceted appearance and nonspecific symptoms, prompting one reviewer to call Lyme the new \\"great imitator\\". Lyme disease may be misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, lupus, Crohn's disease, HIV, or other autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases. As all people with later-stage infection will have a positive antibody test, simple blood tests can exclude Lyme disease as a possible cause of a person's symptoms. Prevention Tick bites may be prevented by avoiding or reducing time in likely tick habitats and taking precautions while in and when getting out of one. Most Lyme human infections are caused by Ixodes nymph bites between April and September. Ticks prefer moist, shaded locations in woodlands, shrubs, tall grasses and leaf litter or wood piles. Tick densities tend to be highest in woodlands, followed by unmaintained edges between woods and lawns (about half as high), ornamental plants and perennial groundcover (about a quarter), and lawns (about 30 times less). Ixodes larvae and nymphs tend to be abundant also where mice nest, such as stone walls and wood logs. Ixodes larvae and nymphs typically wait for potential hosts (\\"quest\\") on leaves or grasses close to the ground with forelegs outstretched; when a host brushes against its limbs, the tick rapidly clings and climbs on the host looking for a skin location to bite. In Northeastern United States, 69% of tick bites are estimated to happen in residences, 11% in schools or camps, 9% in parks or recreational areas, 4% at work, 3% while hunting, and 4% in other areas. Activities associated with tick bites around residences include yard work, brush clearing, gardening, playing in the yard, and letting into the house dogs or cats that roam outside in woody or grassy areas. In parks, tick bites often happen while hiking or camping. Walking on a mowed lawn or center of a trail without touching adjacent vegetation is less risky than crawling or sitting on a log or stone wall. Pets should not be allowed to roam freely in likely tick habitats. As a precaution, CDC recommends soaking or spraying clothes, shoes, and camping gear such as tents, backpacks and sleeping bags with 0.5% permethrin solution and hanging them to dry before use. Permethrin is odorless and safe for humans but highly toxic to ticks. After crawling on permethrin-treated fabric for as few as 10‚Äì20 seconds, tick nymphs become irritated and fall off or die. Permethrin-treated closed-toed shoes and socks reduce by 74 times the number of bites from nymphs that make first contact with a shoe of a person also wearing treated shorts (because nymphs usually quest near the ground, this is a typical contact scenario). Better protection can be achieved by tucking permethrin-treated trousers (pants) into treated socks and a treated long- sleeve shirt into the trousers so as to minimize gaps through which a tick might reach the wearer's skin. Light-colored clothing may make it easier to see ticks and remove them before they bite. Military and outdoor workers' uniforms treated with permethrin have been found to reduce the number of bite cases by 80-95%. Permethrin protection lasts several weeks of wear and washings in customer-treated items and up to 70 washings for factory-treated items. Permethrin should not be used on human skin, underwear or cats. The EPA recommends several tick repellents for use on exposed skin, including DEET, picaridin, IR3535 (a derivative of amino acid beta-alanine), oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE, a natural compound) and OLE's active ingredient para- menthane-diol (PMD). Unlike permethrin, repellents repel but do not kill ticks, protect for only several hours after application, and may be washed off by sweat or water. The most popular repellent is DEET in the U.S. and picaridin in Europe. Unlike DEET, picaridin is odorless and is less likely to irritate the skin or harm fabric or plastics. Repellents with higher concentration may last longer but are not more effective; against ticks, 20% picaridin may work for 8 hours vs. 55‚Äì98.11% DEET for 5‚Äì6 hours or 30-40% OLE for 6 hours. Repellents should not be used under clothes, on eyes, mouth, wounds or cuts, or on babies younger than 2 months (3 years for OLE or PMD). If sunscreen is used, repellent should be applied on top of it. Repellents should not be sprayed directly on a face, but should instead be sprayed on a hand and then rubbed on the face. After coming indoors, clothes, gear and pets should be checked for ticks. Clothes can be put into a hot dryer for 10 minutes to kill ticks (just washing or warm dryer are not enough). Showering as soon as possible, looking for ticks over the entire body, and removing them reduce risk of infection. Unfed tick nymphs are the size of a poppy seed, but a day or two after biting and attaching themselves to a person, they look like a small blood blister. The following areas should be checked especially carefully: armpits, between legs, back of knee, bellybutton, trunk, and in children ears, neck and hair. =Tick removal= Removal of a tick using tweezers Attached ticks should be removed promptly. Risk of infection increases with time of attachment, but in North America risk of Lyme disease is small if the tick is removed within 36 hours. CDC recommends inserting a fine-tipped tweezer between the skin and the tick, grasping very firmly, and pulling the closed tweezer straight away from the skin without twisting, jerking, squeezing or crushing the tick. After tick removal, any tick parts remaining in the skin should be removed with the tweezer, if possible. Wound and hands should then be cleaned with alcohol or soap and water. The tick may be disposed by placing it in a container with alcohol, sealed bag, tape or flushed down the toilet. The bitten person should write down where and when the bite happened so that this can be informed to a doctor if the person gets a rash or flu-like symptoms in the following several weeks. CDC recommends not using fingers, nail polish, petroleum jelly or heat on the tick to try to remove it. In Australia, where the Australian paralysis tick is prevalent, the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy recommends not using tweezers to remove ticks, because if the person is allergic, anaphylaxis could result. Instead, a product should be sprayed on the tick to cause it to freeze and then drop off. A doctor would use liquid nitrogen, but products available from chemists for freezing warts can be used instead. Another method originating from Australia consists in using about 20 cm of dental floss or fishing line for slowly tying an overhand knot between the skin and the tick and then pulling it away from the skin. =Preventive antibiotics= The risk of infectious transmission increases with the duration of tick attachment. It requires between 36 and 48 hours of attachment for the bacteria that causes Lyme to travel from within the tick into its saliva. If a deer tick that is sufficiently likely to be carrying Borrelia is found attached to a person and removed, and if the tick has been attached for 36 hours or is engorged, a single dose of doxycycline administered within the 72 hours after removal may reduce the risk of Lyme disease. It is not generally recommended for all people bitten, as development of infection is rare: about 50 bitten people would have to be treated this way to prevent one case of erythema migrans (i.e. the typical rash found in about 70‚Äì80% of people infected). =Garden landscaping= Several landscaping practices may reduce risk of tick bites in residential yards. The lawn should be kept mowed, leaf litter and weeds removed and groundcover use avoided. Woodlands, shrubs, stone walls and wood piles should be separated from the lawn by a 3-ft-wide rock or woodchip barrier. Without vegetation on the barrier, ticks will tend not to cross it; acaricides may also be sprayed on it to kill ticks. A sun-exposed tick-safe zone at least 9 ft from the barrier should concentrate human activity on the yard, including any patios, playgrounds and gardening. Materials such as wood decking, concrete, bricks, gravel or woodchips may be used on the ground under patios and playgrounds so as to discourage ticks there. An 8-ft-high fence may be added to keep deer away from the tick-safe zone. =Occupational exposure= Outdoor workers are at risk of Lyme disease if they work at sites with infected ticks. This includes construction, landscaping, forestry, brush clearing, land surveying, farming, railroad work, oil field work, utility line work, park or wildlife management. U.S. workers in the northeastern and north- central states are at highest risk of exposure to infected ticks. Ticks may also transmit other tick-borne diseases to workers in these and other regions of the country. Worksites with woods, bushes, high grass or leaf litter are likely to have more ticks. Outdoor workers should be most careful to protect themselves in the late spring and summer when young ticks are most active. =Host animals= Lyme and other deer tick-borne diseases can sometimes be reduced by greatly reducing the deer population on which the adult ticks depend for feeding and reproduction. Lyme disease cases fell following deer eradication on an island, Monhegan, Maine, and following deer control in Mumford Cove, Connecticut. It is worth noting that eliminating deer may lead to a temporary increase in tick density. For example, in the U.S., reducing the deer population to levels of 8 to 10 per square mile (from the current levels of 60 or more deer per square mile in the areas of the country with the highest Lyme disease rates) may reduce tick numbers and reduce the spread of Lyme and other tick-borne diseases. However, such a drastic reduction may be very difficult to implement in many areas, and low to moderate densities of deer or other large mammal hosts may continue to feed sufficient adult ticks to maintain larval densities at high levels. Routine veterinary control of ticks of domestic animals, including livestock, by use of acaricides can contribute to reducing exposure of humans to ticks. In Europe, known reservoirs of Borrelia burgdorferi were 9 small mammals, 7 medium-sized mammals and 16 species of birds (including passerines, sea-birds and pheasants). These animals seem to transmit spirochetes to ticks and thus participate in the natural circulation of B. burgdorferi in Europe. The house mouse is also suspected as well as other species of small rodents, particularly in Eastern Europe and Russia. \\"The reservoir species that contain the most pathogens are the European roe deer Capreolus capreolus; \\"it does not appear to serve as a major reservoir of B. burgdorferi\\" thought Jaenson & al. (1992) (incompetent host for B. burgdorferi and TBE virus) but it is important for feeding the ticks, as red deer and wild boars (Sus scrofa), in which one Rickettsia and three Borrelia species were identified\\", with high risks of coinfection in roe deer. Nevertheless, in the 2000s, in roe deer in Europe \\"two species of Rickettsia and two species of Borrelia were identified\\". =Vaccination= A recombinant vaccine against Lyme disease, based on the outer surface protein A (ospA) of B. burgdorferi, was developed by SmithKline Beecham. In clinical trials involving more than 10,000 people, the vaccine, called LYMErix, was found to confer protective immunity to Borrelia in 76% of adults and 100% of children with only mild or moderate and transient adverse effects. LYMErix was approved on the basis of these trials by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 21 December 1998. Following approval of the vaccine, its entry in clinical practice was slow for a variety of reasons, including its cost, which was often not reimbursed by insurance companies. Subsequently, hundreds of vaccine recipients reported they had developed autoimmune and other side effects. Supported by some advocacy groups, a number of class-action lawsuits were filed against GlaxoSmithKline, alleging the vaccine had caused these health problems. These claims were investigated by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control, which found no connection between the vaccine and the autoimmune complaints. Despite the lack of evidence that the complaints were caused by the vaccine, sales plummeted and LYMErix was withdrawn from the U.S. market by GlaxoSmithKline in February 2002, in the setting of negative media coverage and fears of vaccine side effects. The fate of LYMErix was described in the medical literature as a \\"cautionary tale\\"; an editorial in Nature cited the withdrawal of LYMErix as an instance in which \\"unfounded public fears place pressures on vaccine developers that go beyond reasonable safety considerations.\\" The original developer of the OspA vaccine at the Max Planck Institute told Nature: \\"This just shows how irrational the world can be ... There was no scientific justification for the first OspA vaccine LYMErix being pulled.\\" Vaccines have been formulated and approved for prevention of Lyme disease in dogs. Currently, three Lyme disease vaccines are available. LymeVax, formulated by Fort Dodge Laboratories, contains intact dead spirochetes which expose the host to the organism. Galaxy Lyme, Intervet- Schering-Plough's vaccine, targets proteins OspC and OspA. The OspC antibodies kill any of the bacteria that have not been killed by the OspA antibodies. Canine Recombinant Lyme, formulated by Merial, generates antibodies against the OspA protein so a tick feeding on a vaccinated dog draws in blood full of anti-OspA antibodies, which kill the spirochetes in the tick's gut before they are transmitted to the dog. A hexavalent (OspA) protein subunit-based vaccine candidate VLA15 was granted fast track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2017 which will allow further study. Treatment Antibiotics are the primary treatment. The specific approach to their use is dependent on the individual affected and the stage of the disease. For most people with early localized infection, oral administration of doxycycline is widely recommended as the first choice, as it is effective against not only Borrelia bacteria but also a variety of other illnesses carried by ticks. People taking doxycycline should avoid sun exposure because of higher risk of sunburns. Doxycycline is contraindicated in children younger than eight years of age and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding; alternatives to doxycycline are amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, and azithromycin. Azithromicyn is recommended only in case of intolerance to the other antibiotics. The standard treatment for cellulitis, cephalexin, is not useful for Lyme disease. When it is unclear if a rash is caused by Lyme or cellulitis, the IDSA recommends treatment with cefuroxime or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, as these are effective against both infections. Individuals with early disseminated or late Lyme infection may have symptomatic cardiac disease, Lyme arthritis, or neurologic symptoms like facial palsy, radiculopathy, meningitis, or peripheral neuropathy. Intravenous administration of ceftriaxone is recommended as the first choice in these cases; cefotaxime and doxycycline are available as alternatives. These treatment regimens last from one to four weeks. Neurologic complications of Lyme disease may be treated with doxycycline as it can be taken by mouth and has a lower cost, although in North America evidence of efficacy is only indirect. In case of failure, guidelines recommend retreatment with injectable ceftriaxone. Several months after treatment for Lyme arthritis, if joint swelling persists or returns, a second round of antibiotics may be considered; intravenous antibiotics are preferred for retreatment in case of poor response to oral antibiotics. Outside of that, a prolonged antibiotic regimen lasting more than 28 days is not recommended as no evidence shows it to be effective. IgM and IgG antibody levels may be elevated for years even after successful treatment with antibiotics. As antibody levels are not indicative of treatment success, testing for them is not recommended. Facial palsy may resolve without treatment; however, antibiotic treatment is recommended to stop other Lyme complications. Corticosteroids are not recommended when facial palsy is caused by Lyme disease. In those with facial palsy, frequent use of artificial tears while awake is recommended, along with ointment and a patch or taping the eye closed when sleeping. About a third of people with Lyme carditis need a temporary pacemaker until their heart conduction abnormality resolves, and 21% need to be hospitalized. Lyme carditis should not be treated with corticosteroids. People with Lyme arthritis should limit their level of physical activity to avoid damaging affected joints, and in case of limping should use crutches. Pain associated with Lyme disease may be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Corticosteroid joint injections are not recommended for Lyme arthritis that is being treated with antibiotics. People with Lyme arthritis treated with intravenous antibiotics or two months of oral antibiotics who continue to have joint swelling two months after treatment and have negative PCR test for Borrelia DNA in the synovial fluid are said to have antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis; this is more common after infection by certain Borrelia strains in people with certain genetic and immunologic characteristics. Antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis may be symptomatically treated with NSAIDs, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), or arthroscopic synovectomy. Physical therapy is recommended for adults after resolution of Lyme arthritis. People receiving treatment should be advised that reinfection is possible and how to prevent it. Prognosis Lyme disease's typical first sign, the erythema migrans (EM) rash, resolves within several weeks even without treatment. However, in untreated people, the infection often disseminates to the nervous system, heart, or joints, possibly causing permanent damage to body tissues. People who receive recommended antibiotic treatment within several days of appearance of an initial EM rash have the best prospects. Recovery may not be total or immediate. The percentage of people achieving full recovery in the United States increases from about 64‚Äì71% at end of treatment for EM rash to about 84‚Äì90% after 30 months; higher percentages are reported in Europe. Treatment failure, i.e. persistence of original or appearance of new signs of the disease, occurs only in a few people. Remaining people are considered cured but continue to experience subjective symptoms, e.g. joint or muscle pains or fatigue. These symptoms usually are mild and nondisabling. People treated only after nervous system manifestations of the disease may end up with objective neurological deficits, in addition to subjective symptoms. In Europe, an average of 32‚Äì33 months after initial Lyme symptoms in people treated mostly with doxycycline 200 mg for 14‚Äì21 days, the percentage of people with lingering symptoms was much higher among those diagnosed with neuroborreliosis (50%) than among those with only an EM rash (16%). In another European study, 5 years after treatment for neuroborreliosis, lingering symptoms were less common among children (15%) than adults (30%), and in the latter was less common among those treated within 30 days of the first symptom (16%) than among those treated later (39%); among those with lingering symptoms, 54% had daily activities restricted and 19% were on sick leave or incapacitated. Some data suggest that about 90% of Lyme facial palsies treated with antibiotics recover fully a median of 24 days after appearing and most of the rest recover with only mild abnormality. However, in Europe 41% of people treated for facial palsy had other lingering symptoms at followup up to 6 months later, including 28% with numbness or altered sensation and 14% with fatigue or concentration problems. Palsies in both sides of the face are associated with worse and longer time to recovery. Historical data suggests that untreated people with facial palsies recover at nearly the same rate, but 88% subsequently have Lyme arthritis. Other research shows that synkinesis (involuntary movement of a facial muscle when another one is voluntarily moved) can become evident only 6‚Äì12 months after facial palsy appears to be resolved, as damaged nerves regrow and sometimes connect to incorrect muscles. Synkinesis is associated with corticosteroid use. In longer-term follow-up, 16‚Äì23% of Lyme facial palsies do not fully recover. In Europe, about a quarter of people with Bannwarth syndrome (Lyme radiculopathy and lymphocytic meningitis) treated with intravenous ceftriaxone for 14 days an average of 30 days after first symptoms had to be retreated 3‚Äì6 months later because of unsatisfactory clinical response or continued objective markers of infection in cerebrospinal fluid; after 12 months, 64% recovered fully, 31% had nondisabling mild or infrequent symptoms that did not require regular use of analgesics, and 5% had symptoms that were disabling or required substantial use of analgesics. The most common lingering nondisabling symptoms were headache, fatigue, altered sensation, joint pains, memory disturbances, malaise, radicular pain, sleep disturbances, muscle pains, and concentration disturbances. Lingering disabling symptoms included facial palsy and other impaired movement. Recovery from late neuroborreliosis tends to take longer and be less complete than from early neuroborreliosis, probably because of irreversible neurologic damage. About half the people with Lyme carditis progress to complete heart block, but it usually resolves in a week. Other Lyme heart conduction abnormalities resolve typically within 6 weeks. About 94% of people have full recovery, but 5% need a permanent pacemaker and 1% end up with persistent heart block (the actual percentage may be higher because of unrecognized cases). Lyme myocardial complications usually are mild and self-limiting. However, in some cases Lyme carditis can be fatal. Recommended antibiotic treatments are effective in about 90% of Lyme arthritis cases, although it can take several months for inflammation to resolve and a second round of antibiotics is often necessary. Antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis also eventually resolves, typically within 9‚Äì14 months (range 4 months ‚Äì 4 years); DMARDs or synovectomy can accelerate recovery. Reinfection is not uncommon. In a U.S. study, 6‚Äì11% of people treated for an EM rash had another EM rash within 30 months. The second rash typically is due to infection by a different Borrelia strain. People who have nonspecific, subjective symptoms such as fatigue, joint and muscle aches, or cognitive difficulties for more than six months after recommended treatment for Lyme disease are said to have post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. As of 2016 the reason for the lingering symptoms was not known; the condition is generally managed similarly to fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome. Epidemiology Countries with reported Lyme disease cases. Lyme disease occurs regularly in Northern Hemisphere temperate regions. =Africa= In northern Africa, B. burgdorferi sensu lato has been identified in Morocco, Algeria, Egypt and Tunisia. Lyme disease in sub-Saharan Africa is presently unknown, but evidence indicates it may occur in humans in this region. The abundance of hosts and tick vectors would favor the establishment of Lyme infection in Africa. In East Africa, two cases of Lyme disease have been reported in Kenya. =Asia= B. burgdorferi sensu lato-infested ticks are being found more frequently in Japan, as well as in northwest China, Nepal, Thailand and far eastern Russia. Borrelia has also been isolated in Mongolia. =Europe= In Europe, Lyme disease is caused by infection with one or more pathogenic European genospecies of the spirochaete B. burgdorferi sensu lato, mainly transmitted by the tick Ixodes ricinus. Cases of B. burgdorferi sensu lato-infected ticks are found predominantly in central Europe, particularly in Slovenia and Austria, but have been isolated in almost every country on the continent. Number of cases in southern Europe, such as Italy and Portugal, is much lower. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom the number of laboratory confirmed cases of Lyme disease has been rising steadily since voluntary reporting was introduced in 1986 when 68 cases were recorded in the UK and Republic of Ireland combined. In the UK there were 23 confirmed cases in 1988 and 19 in 1990, but 973 in 2009 and 953 in 2010. Provisional figures for the first 3 quarters of 2011 show a 26% increase on the same period in 2010. It is thought, however, that the actual number of cases is significantly higher than suggested by the above figures, with the UK's Health Protection Agency estimating that there are between 2,000 and 3,000 cases per year, (with an average of around 15% of the infections acquired overseas), while Dr Darrel Ho-Yen, Director of the Scottish Toxoplasma Reference Laboratory and National Lyme Disease Testing Service, believes that the number of confirmed cases should be multiplied by 10 \\"to take account of wrongly diagnosed cases, tests giving false results, sufferers who weren't tested, people who are infected but not showing symptoms, failures to notify and infected individuals who don't consult a doctor.\\" Despite Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi infection) being a notifiable disease in Scotland since January 1990 which should therefore be reported on the basis of clinical suspicion, it is believed that many GPs are unaware of the requirement. Mandatory reporting, limited to laboratory test results only, was introduced throughout the UK in October 2010, under the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010. Although there is a greater number of cases of Lyme disease in the New Forest, Salisbury Plain, Exmoor, the South Downs, parts of Wiltshire and Berkshire, Thetford Forest and the West coast and islands of Scotland infected ticks are widespread, and can even be found in the parks of London. A 1989 report found that 25% of forestry workers in the New Forest were seropositive, as were between 2% and 4‚Äì5% of the general local population of the area. Tests on pet dogs, carried out throughout the country in 2009 indicated that around 2.5% of ticks in the UK may be infected, considerably higher than previously thought. It is thought that global warming may lead to an increase in tick activity in the future, as well as an increase in the amount of time that people spend in public parks, thus increasing the risk of infection. =North America= Many studies in North America have examined ecological and environmental correlates of the number of people affected by Lyme disease. A 2005 study using climate suitability modelling of I. scapularis projected that climate change would cause an overall 213% increase in suitable vector habitat by the year 2080, with northward expansions in Canada, increased suitability in the central U.S., and decreased suitable habitat and vector retraction in the southern U.S. A 2008 review of published studies concluded that the presence of forests or forested areas was the only variable that consistently elevated the risk of Lyme disease whereas other environmental variables showed little or no concordance between studies. The authors argued that the factors influencing tick density and human risk between sites are still poorly understood, and that future studies should be conducted over longer time periods, become more standardized across regions, and incorporate existing knowledge of regional Lyme disease ecology. Canada Owing to changing climate, the range of ticks able to carry Lyme disease has expanded from a limited area of Ontario to include areas of southern Quebec, Manitoba, northern Ontario, southern New Brunswick, southwest Nova Scotia and limited parts of Saskatchewan and Alberta, as well as British Columbia. Cases have been reported as far east as the island of Newfoundland. A model-based prediction by Leighton et al. (2012) suggests that the range of the I. scapularis tick will expand into Canada by 46 km/year over the next decade, with warming climatic temperatures as the main driver of increased speed of spread. Mexico A 2007 study suggests Borrelia burgdorferi infections are endemic to Mexico, from four cases reported between 1999 and 2000. United States CDC map showing the risk of Lyme disease in the United States, particularly its concentration in the Northeast Megalopolis and western Wisconsin. Each year, approximately 30,000 new cases are reported to the CDC however, this number is likely underestimated. The CDC is currently conducting research on evaluation and diagnostics of the disease and preliminary results suggest the number of new cases to be around 300,000. Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in North America and Europe, and one of the fastest-growing infectious diseases in the United States. Of cases reported to the United States CDC, the ratio of Lyme disease infection is 7.9 cases for every 100,000 persons. In the ten states where Lyme disease is most common, the average was 31.6 cases for every 100,000 persons for the year 2005. Although Lyme disease has been reported in all states about 99% of all reported cases are confined to just five geographic areas (New England, Mid-Atlantic, East-North Central, South Atlantic, and West North-Central). New 2011 CDC Lyme case definition guidelines are used to determine confirmed CDC surveillance cases. Effective January 2008, the CDC gives equal weight to laboratory evidence from 1) a positive culture for B. burgdorferi; 2) two-tier testing (ELISA screening and Western blot confirming); or 3) single-tier IgG (old infection) Western blot. Previously, the CDC only included laboratory evidence based on (1) and (2) in their surveillance case definition. The case definition now includes the use of Western blot without prior ELISA screen. The number of reported cases of the disease has been increasing, as are endemic regions in North America. For example, B. burgdorferi sensu lato was previously thought to be hindered in its ability to be maintained in an enzootic cycle in California, because it was assumed the large lizard population would dilute the number of people affected by B. burgdorferi in local tick populations; this has since been brought into question, as some evidence has suggested lizards can become infected. Except for one study in Europe, much of the data implicating lizards is based on DNA detection of the spirochete and has not demonstrated that lizards are able to infect ticks feeding upon them. As some experiments suggest lizards are refractory to infection with Borrelia, it appears likely their involvement in the enzootic cycle is more complex and species-specific. While B. burgdorferi is most associated with ticks hosted by white-tailed deer and white-footed mice, Borrelia afzelii is most frequently detected in rodent- feeding vector ticks, and Borrelia garinii and Borrelia valaisiana appear to be associated with birds. Both rodents and birds are competent reservoir hosts for B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. The resistance of a genospecies of Lyme disease spirochetes to the bacteriolytic activities of the alternative complement pathway of various host species may determine its reservoir host association. Several similar but apparently distinct conditions may exist, caused by various species or subspecies of Borrelia in North America. A regionally restricted condition that may be related to Borrelia infection is southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI), also known as Masters disease. Amblyomma americanum, known commonly as the lone-star tick, is recognized as the primary vector for STARI. In some parts of the geographical distribution of STARI, Lyme disease is quite rare (e.g., Arkansas), so people in these regions experiencing Lyme-like symptoms‚Äîespecially if they follow a bite from a lone-star tick‚Äîshould consider STARI as a possibility. It is generally a milder condition than Lyme and typically responds well to antibiotic treatment. In recent years there have been 5 to 10 cases a year of a disease similar to Lyme occurring in Montana. It occurs primarily in pockets along the Yellowstone River in central Montana. People have developed a red bull's-eye rash around a tick bite followed by weeks of fatigue and a fever. Lyme disease effects are comparable among males and females. A wide range of age groups is affected, though the number of cases is highest among 10- to 19-year-olds. For unknown reasons, Lyme disease is seven times more common among Asians. =South America= In South America, tick-borne disease recognition and occurrence is rising. In Brazil, a Lyme-like disease known as Baggio‚ÄìYoshinari syndrome was identified, caused by microorganisms that do not belong to the B. burgdorferi sensu lato complex and transmitted by ticks of the Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus genera. The first reported case of BYS in Brazil was made in 1992 in Cotia, S√£o Paulo. B. burgdorferi sensu stricto antigens in people have been identified in Colombia, and Bolivia. History The evolutionary history of Borrelia burgdorferi genetics has been the subject of recent studies. One study has found that prior to the reforestation that accompanied post-colonial farm abandonment in New England and the wholesale migration into the mid-west that occurred during the early 19th century, Lyme disease was present for thousands of years in America and had spread along with its tick hosts from the Northeast to the Midwest. John Josselyn, who visited New England in 1638 and again from 1663‚Äì1670, wrote \\"there be infinite numbers of tikes hanging upon the bushes in summer time that will cleave to man's garments and creep into his breeches eating themselves in a short time into the very flesh of a man. I have seen the stockins of those that have gone through the woods covered with them.\\" This is also confirmed by the writings of Peter Kalm, a Swedish botanist who was sent to America by Linnaeus, and who found the forests of New York \\"abound\\" with ticks when he visited in 1749. When Kalm's journey was retraced 100 years later, the forests were gone and the Lyme bacterium had probably become isolated to a few pockets along the northeast coast, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. Perhaps the first detailed description of what is now known as Lyme disease appeared in the writings of John Walker after a visit to the island of Jura (Deer Island) off the west coast of Scotland in 1764. He gives a good description both of the symptoms of Lyme disease (with \\"exquisite pain [in] the interior parts of the limbs\\") and of the tick vector itself, which he describes as a \\"worm\\" with a body which is \\"of a reddish colour and of a compressed shape with a row of feet on each side\\" that \\"penetrates the skin\\". Many people from this area of Great Britain emigrated to North America between 1717 and the end of the 18th century. The examination of preserved museum specimens has found Borrelia DNA in an infected Ixodes ricinus tick from Germany that dates back to 1884, and from an infected mouse from Cape Cod that died in 1894. The 2010 autopsy of √ñtzi the Iceman, a 5,300-year-old mummy, revealed the presence of the DNA sequence of Borrelia burgdorferi making him the earliest known human with Lyme disease. The early European studies of what is now known as Lyme disease described its skin manifestations. The first study dates to 1883 in Breslau, Germany (now Wroc≈Çaw, Poland), where physician Alfred Buchwald described a man who had suffered for 16 years with a degenerative skin disorder now known as acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans. At a 1909 research conference, Swedish dermatologist Arvid Afzelius presented a study about an expanding, ring-like lesion he had observed in an older woman following the bite of a sheep tick. He named the lesion erythema migrans. The skin condition now known as borrelial lymphocytoma was first described in 1911. The modern history of medical understanding of the disease, including its cause, diagnosis, and treatment, has been difficult. Neurological problems following tick bites were recognized starting in the 1920s. French physicians Garin and Bujadoux described a farmer with a painful sensory radiculitis accompanied by mild meningitis following a tick bite. A large, ring-shaped rash was also noted, although the doctors did not relate it to the meningoradiculitis. In 1930, the Swedish dermatologist Sven Hellerstr√∂m was the first to propose EM and neurological symptoms following a tick bite were related. In the 1940s, German neurologist Alfred Bannwarth described several cases of chronic lymphocytic meningitis and polyradiculoneuritis, some of which were accompanied by erythematous skin lesions. Carl Lennhoff, who worked at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, believed many skin conditions were caused by spirochetes. In 1948, he used a special stain to microscopically observe what he believed were spirochetes in various types of skin lesions, including EM. Although his conclusions were later shown to be erroneous, interest in the study of spirochetes was sparked. In 1949, Nils Thyresson, who also worked at the Karolinska Institute, was the first to treat ACA with penicillin. In the 1950s, the relationship among tick bite, lymphocytoma, EM and Bannwarth's syndrome was recognized throughout Europe leading to the widespread use of penicillin for treatment in Europe. In 1970, a dermatologist in Wisconsin named Rudolph Scrimenti recognized an EM lesion in a person after recalling a paper by Hellerstr√∂m that had been reprinted in an American science journal in 1950. This was the first documented case of EM in the United States. Based on the European literature, he treated the person with penicillin. The full syndrome now known as Lyme disease was not recognized until a cluster of cases originally thought to be juvenile rheumatoid arthritis was identified in three towns in southeastern Connecticut in 1975, including the towns Lyme and Old Lyme, which gave the disease its popular name. This was investigated by physicians David Snydman and Allen Steere of the Epidemic Intelligence Service, and by others from Yale University, including Stephen Malawista, who is credited as a co-discover of the disease. The recognition that the people in the United States had EM led to the recognition that \\"Lyme arthritis\\" was one manifestation of the same tick-borne condition known in Europe. Before 1976, the elements of B. burgdorferi sensu lato infection were called or known as tick-borne meningopolyneuritis, Garin-Bujadoux syndrome, Bannwarth syndrome, Afzelius's disease, Montauk Knee or sheep tick fever. Since 1976 the disease is most often referred to as Lyme disease, Lyme borreliosis or simply borreliosis. In 1980, Steere, et al., began to test antibiotic regimens in adults with Lyme disease. In the same year, New York State Health Dept. epidemiologist Jorge Benach provided Willy Burgdorfer, a researcher at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory, with collections of I. dammini [scapularis] from Shelter Island, New York, a known Lyme-endemic area as part of an ongoing investigation of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. In examining the ticks for rickettsiae, Burgdorfer noticed \\"poorly stained, rather long, irregularly coiled spirochetes.\\" Further examination revealed spirochetes in 60% of the ticks. Burgdorfer credited his familiarity with the European literature for his realization that the spirochetes might be the \\"long-sought cause of ECM and Lyme disease.\\" Benach supplied him with more ticks from Shelter Island and sera from people diagnosed with Lyme disease. University of Texas Health Science Center researcher Alan Barbour \\"offered his expertise to culture and immunochemically characterize the organism.\\" Burgdorfer subsequently confirmed his discovery by isolating, from people with Lyme disease, spirochetes identical to those found in ticks. In June 1982, he published his findings in Science, and the spirochete was named Borrelia burgdorferi in his honor. After the identification of B. burgdorferi as the causative agent of Lyme disease, antibiotics were selected for testing, guided by in vitro antibiotic sensitivities, including tetracycline antibiotics, amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, intravenous and intramuscular penicillin and intravenous ceftriaxone. The mechanism of tick transmission was also the subject of much discussion. B. burgdorferi spirochetes were identified in tick saliva in 1987, confirming the hypothesis that transmission occurred via tick salivary glands. Society and culture Urbanization and other anthropogenic factors can be implicated in the spread of Lyme disease to humans. In many areas, expansion of suburban neighborhoods has led to gradual deforestation of surrounding wooded areas and increased border contact between humans and tick- dense areas. Human expansion has also resulted in a reduction of predators that hunt deer as well as mice, chipmunks and other small rodents‚Äîthe primary reservoirs for Lyme disease. As a consequence of increased human contact with host and vector, the likelihood of transmission of the disease has greatly increased. Researchers are investigating possible links between global warming and the spread of vector-borne diseases, including Lyme disease. = Controversy = The term \\"chronic Lyme disease\\" is controversial and not recognized in the medical literature, and most medical authorities advise against long-term antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease. Studies have shown that most people diagnosed with \\"chronic Lyme disease\\" either have no objective evidence of previous or current infection with B. burgdorferi or are people who should be classified as having post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS), which is defined as continuing or relapsing non-specific symptoms (such as fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and cognitive complaints) in a person previously treated for Lyme disease. = Legislation = In July 2019 the US House of Representatives ordered an investigation into whether the Pentagon had released 'weaponized' ticks infected with Lyme disease into the environment between 1950 and 1975. Scientists identified this investigation as based on a conspiracy theory and claimed that an investigation was unnecessary and a poor use of funds. Other animals Prevention of Lyme disease is an important step in keeping dogs safe in endemic areas. Prevention education and a number of preventative measures are available. First, for dog owners who live near or who often frequent tick-infested areas, routine vaccinations of their dogs is an important step. Another crucial preventive measure is the use of persistent acaricides, such as topical repellents or pesticides that contain triazapentadienes (Amitraz), phenylpyrazoles (Fipronil), or permethrin (pyrethroids). These acaricides target primarily the adult stages of Lyme- carrying ticks and reduce the number of reproductively active ticks in the environment. Formulations of these ingredients are available in a variety of topical forms, including spot-ons, sprays, powders, impregnated collars, solutions, and shampoos. Examination of a dog for ticks after being in a tick- infested area is an important precautionary measure to take in the prevention of Lyme disease. Key spots to examine include the head, neck, and ears. In dogs, a serious long-term prognosis may result in glomerular disease, which is a category of kidney damage that may cause chronic kidney disease. Dogs may also experience chronic joint disease if the disease is left untreated. However, the majority of cases of Lyme disease in dogs result in a complete recovery with, and sometimes without, treatment with antibiotics. In rare cases, Lyme disease can be fatal to both humans and dogs. Lyme disease can also infect deer. The winter tick which has affected moose populations in the 21st century is not a carrier of Lyme. Research In the US, the National Institutes of Health has supported research into bacterial persistence.

It is used to treat anxiety disorders, trouble sleeping, active seizures including status epilepticus, alcohol withdrawal, and chemotherapy- induced nausea and vomiting. It is also used during surgery to interfere with memory formation and to sedate those who are being mechanically ventilated. While it can be used for severe agitation, midazolam is usually preferred. It is also used, along with other treatments, for acute coronary syndrome due to cocaine use. It can be given by mouth or as an injection into a muscle or vein. When given by injection onset of effects is between one and thirty minutes and effects last for up to a day. Common side effects include weakness, sleepiness, low blood pressure, and a decreased effort to breathe. When given intravenously the person should be closely monitored. Among those who are depressed there may be an increased risk of suicide. With long-term use, larger doses may be required for the same effect. Physical dependence and psychological dependence may also occur. If stopped suddenly after long-term use, benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome may occur. Older people more often develop adverse effects. In this age group lorazepam is associated with falls and hip fractures. Due to these concerns, lorazepam use is generally only recommended for up to two to four weeks. Lorazepam was initially patented in 1963 and went on sale in the United States in 1977. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 60th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than twelve million prescriptions.  Medical uses  =Anxiety= Lorazepam is used in the short-term management of severe anxiety. In the US, the FDA advises against use of benzodiazepines such as lorazepam for longer than four weeks. It is fast acting, and useful in treating fast onset panic anxiety. Lorazepam can effectively reduce agitation and induce sleep, and the duration of effects from a single dose makes it an appropriate choice for the short-term treatment of insomnia, especially in the presence of severe anxiety or night terrors. It has a fairly short duration of action. Withdrawal symptoms, including rebound insomnia and rebound anxiety, may occur after seven days' use of lorazepam. =Seizures= Intravenous diazepam or lorazepam are first-line treatments for convulsive status epilepticus. Lorazepam is more effective than diazepam and intravenous phenytoin in the treatment of status epilepticus and has a lower risk of continuing seizures that might require additional medication. However, phenobarbital has a superior success rate compared to lorazepam and other drugs, at least in the elderly. Lorazepam's anticonvulsant properties and pharmacokinetic profile make intravenous use reliable for terminating acute seizures, but induce prolonged sedation. Oral benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, are occasionally used as long-term prophylactic treatment of resistant absence seizures; because of gradual tolerance to their anti-seizure effects, benzodiazepines such as lorazepam are not considered first-line therapies. Lorazepam's anticonvulsant and CNS depressant properties are useful for the treatment and prevention of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. In this setting, impaired liver function is not a hazard with lorazepam, since lorazepam does not require oxidation, in the liver or otherwise, for its metabolism. =Sedation= Lorazepam is sometimes used for individuals receiving mechanical ventilation. However, in critically ill people, propofol has been found to be superior to lorazepam both in effectiveness and overall cost; as a result, the use of propofol for this indication is now encouraged, whereas the use of lorazepam is discouraged. Its relative effectiveness in preventing new memory formation, along with its ability to reduce agitation and anxiety, makes lorazepam useful as premedication. It is given before a general anesthetic to reduce the amount of anesthetic required, or before unpleasant awake procedures, such as in dentistry or endoscopies, to reduce anxiety, to increase compliance, and to induce amnesia for the procedure. Lorazepam by mouth is given 90 to 120 minutes before procedures, and intravenous lorazepam as late as 10 minutes before procedures. Lorazepam is sometimes used as an alternative to midazolam in palliative sedation. In intensive care units lorazepam is sometimes used to produce anxiolysis, hypnosis, and amnesia. =Agitation= Lorazepam is sometimes used as an alternative to haloperidol when there is the need for rapid sedation of violent or agitated individuals, but haloperidol plus promethazine is preferred due to better effectiveness and due to lorazepam's adverse effects on respiratory function. However, adverse effects such as behavioral disinhibition may make benzodiazepines inappropriate for some people who are acutely psychotic . Acute delirium is sometimes treated with lorazepam, but as it can cause paradoxical effects, it is preferably given together with haloperidol. Lorazepam is absorbed relatively slowly if given intramuscularly, a common route in restraint situations. =Other= Catatonia with inability to speak is responsive to lorazepam. Symptoms may recur and treatment for some days may be necessary. Catatonia due to abrupt or overly rapid withdrawal from benzodiazepines, as part of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, should also respond to lorazepam treatment. As lorazepam can have paradoxical effects, haloperidol is sometimes given at the same time. It is sometimes used in chemotherapy in addition to medications used to treat nausea and vomiting, i.e. nausea and vomiting caused or worsened by psychological sensitization to the thought of being sick.  Adverse effects  Many beneficial effects of lorazepam (e.g., sedative, muscle relaxant, anti-anxiety, and amnesic effects) may become adverse effects when unwanted. Adverse effects can include sedation and low blood pressure; the effects of lorazepam are increased in combination with other CNS depressant drugs. Other adverse effects include confusion, ataxia, inhibiting the formation of new memories, and hangover effects. With long-term benzodiazepine use it is unclear whether cognitive impairments fully return to normal after stopping lorazepam use; cognitive deficits persist for at least six months after withdrawal, but longer than six months may be required for recovery of cognitive function. Lorazepam appears to have more profound adverse effects on memory than other benzodiazepines; it impairs both explicit and implicit memory. In the elderly, falls may occur as a result of benzodiazepines. Adverse effects are more common in the elderly, and they appear at lower doses than in younger people. Benzodiazepines can cause or worsen depression. Paradoxical effects can also occur, such as worsening of seizures, or paradoxical excitement; paradoxical excitement is more likely to occur in the elderly, children, those with a history of alcohol abuse, and in people with a history of aggression or anger problems. Lorazepam's effects are dose-dependent, meaning the higher the dose, the stronger the effects (and side effects) will be. Using the smallest dose needed to achieve desired effects lessens the risk of adverse effects. Sedative drugs and sleeping pills, including lorazepam, have been associated with an increased risk of death. Sedation is the side effect people taking lorazepam most frequently report. In a group of around 3,500 people treated for anxiety, the most common side effects complained of from lorazepam were sedation (15.9%), dizziness (6.9%), weakness (4.2%), and unsteadiness (3.4%). Side effects such as sedation and unsteadiness increased with age. Cognitive impairment, behavioural disinhibition and respiratory depression as well as hypotension may also occur. * Paradoxical effects: In some cases, paradoxical effects can occur with benzodiazepines, such as increased hostility, aggression, angry outbursts, and psychomotor agitation. These effects are seen more commonly with lorazepam than with other benzodiazepines. Paradoxical effects are more likely to occur with higher doses, in people with pre-existing personality disorders and those with a psychiatric illness. Frustrating stimuli may trigger such reactions, though the drug may have been prescribed to help the person cope with such stress and frustration in the first place. As paradoxical effects appear to be dose-related, they usually subside on dose reduction or on complete withdrawal of lorazepam. * Suicidality: Benzodiazepines are associated with increased risk of suicide, possibly due to disinhibition. Higher dosages appear to confer greater risk. * Amnesic effects: Among benzodiazepines, lorazepam has relatively strong amnesic effects, but people soon develop tolerance to this with regular use. To avoid amnesia (or excess sedation) being a problem, the initial total daily lorazepam dose should not exceed 2 mg. This also applies to use for night sedation. Five participants in a sleep study were prescribed lorazepam 4 mg at night, and the next evening, three subjects unexpectedly volunteered memory gaps for parts of that day, an effect that subsided completely after two to three days' use. Amnesic effects cannot be estimated from the degree of sedation present, since the two effects are unrelated. High-dose or prolonged parenterally administered lorazepam is sometimes associated with propylene glycol poisoning. In September 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the boxed warning be updated for all benzodiazepine medicines to describe the risks of abuse, misuse, addiction, physical dependence, and withdrawal reactions consistently across all the medicines in the class. = Contraindications = Lorazepam should be avoided in people with: * Allergy or hypersensitivity ‚Äì Past hypersensitivity or allergy to lorazepam, to any benzodiazepine, or to any of the ingredients in lorazepam tablets or injections * Respiratory failure ‚Äì Benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, may depress central nervous system respiratory drive and are contraindicated in severe respiratory failure. An example would be the inappropriate use to relieve anxiety associated with acute severe asthma. The anxiolytic effects may also be detrimental to a person's willingness and ability to fight for breath. However, if mechanical ventilation becomes necessary, lorazepam may be used to facilitate deep sedation. * Acute intoxication ‚Äì Lorazepam may interact synergistically with the effects of alcohol, narcotics, or other psychoactive substances. It should, therefore, not be administered to a drunk or intoxicated person. * Ataxia ‚Äì This is a neurological clinical sign, consisting of unsteady and clumsy motion of the limbs and torso, due to the failure of gross muscle movement coordination, most evident on standing and walking. It is the classic way in which acute alcohol intoxication may affect a person. Benzodiazepines should not be administered to people already-ataxic. * Acute narrow-angle glaucoma ‚Äì Lorazepam has pupil-dilating effects, which may further interfere with the drainage of aqueous humor from the anterior chamber of the eye, thus worsening narrow-angle glaucoma. * Sleep apnea ‚Äì Sleep apnea may be worsened by lorazepam's central nervous system depressant effects. It may further reduce the person's ability to protect his or her airway during sleep. * Myasthenia gravis ‚Äì This condition is characterized by muscle weakness, so a muscle relaxant such as lorazepam may exacerbate symptoms. * Pregnancy and breastfeeding ‚Äì Lorazepam belongs to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pregnancy category D, which means it is likely to cause harm to the developing baby if taken during the first trimester of pregnancy. The evidence is inconclusive whether lorazepam if taken early in pregnancy results in reduced intelligence, neurodevelopmental problems, physical malformations in cardiac or facial structure, or other malformations in some newborns. Lorazepam given to pregnant women antenatally may cause floppy infant syndrome in the neonate, or respiratory depression necessitating ventilation. Regular lorazepam use during late pregnancy (the third trimester), carries a definite risk of benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome in the neonate. Neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal may include hypotonia, reluctance to suck, apneic spells, cyanosis, and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. Symptoms of floppy infant syndrome and the neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome have been reported to persist from hours to months after birth. Lorazepam may also inhibit fetal liver bilirubin glucuronidation, leading to neonatal jaundice. Lorazepam is present in breast milk, so caution must be exercised about breastfeeding. = Specific groups = * Children and the elderly ‚Äì The safety and effectiveness of lorazepam is not well determined in children under 18 years of age, but it is used to treat acute seizures. Dose requirements have to be individualized, especially in people who are elderly and debilitated in whom the risk of oversedation is greater. Long-term therapy may lead to cognitive deficits, especially in the elderly, which may only be partially reversible. The elderly metabolize benzodiazepines more slowly than younger people and are more sensitive to the adverse effects of benzodiazepines compared to younger individuals even at similar plasma levels. Additionally, the elderly tend to take more drugs which may interact or enhance the effects of benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, have been found to increase the risk of falls and fractures in the elderly. As a result, dosage recommendations for the elderly are about half of those used in younger individuals and used for no longer than two weeks. Lorazepam may also be slower to clear in the elderly, leading potentially to accumulation and enhanced effects. Lorazepam, similar to other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines, causes impairments in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. The combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial, but incomplete, tolerance develops to these impairments. * Liver or kidney failure ‚Äì Lorazepam may be safer than most benzodiazepines in people with impaired liver function. Like oxazepam, it does not require liver oxidation, but only liver glucuronidation into lorazepam-glucuronide. Therefore, impaired liver function is unlikely to result in lorazepam accumulation to an extent causing adverse reactions. Similarly kidney disease has minimal effects on lorazepam levels. * Surgical premedication ‚Äì Informed consent given only after receiving lorazepam premedication could have its validity challenged later. Staff must use chaperones to guard against allegations of abuse during treatment. Such allegations may arise because of incomplete amnesia, disinhibition, and impaired ability to process cues. Because of its relatively long duration of residual effects (sedation, ataxia, hypotension, and amnesia), lorazepam premedication is best suited for hospital inpatient use. People should not be discharged from the hospital within 24 hours of receiving lorazepam premedication unless accompanied by a caregiver. They should also not drive, operate machinery, or use alcohol within this period. * Drug and alcohol dependence ‚Äì The risk of abuse of lorazepam is increased in dependent people. *Comorbid psychiatric disorders also increase the risk of dependence and paradoxical adverse effects. = Tolerance and dependence = Dependence typified by a withdrawal syndrome occurs in about one-third of individuals who are treated for longer than four weeks with a benzodiazepine. Higher doses and longer periods of use increase the risk of developing a benzodiazepine dependence. Potent benzodiazepines with a relatively short half life, such as lorazepam, alprazolam, and triazolam, have the highest risk of causing a dependence. Tolerance to benzodiazepine effects develops with regular use. This is desirable with amnesic and sedative effects but undesirable with anxiolytic, hypnotic, and anticonvulsant effects. People initially experience drastic relief from anxiety and sleeplessness, but symptoms gradually return, relatively soon in the case of insomnia, but more slowly in the case of anxiety symptoms. After four to six months of regular benzodiazepine use, evidence of continued efficacy declines. If regular treatment is continued for longer than four to six months, dose increases may be necessary to maintain effects, but treatment-resistant symptoms may in fact be benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms. Due to the development of tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects, benzodiazepines are generally not recommended for long-term use for the management of epilepsy. Increasing the dose may overcome tolerance, but tolerance may then develop to the higher dose and adverse effects may persist and worsen. The mechanism of tolerance to benzodiazepines is complex and involves GABAA receptor downregulation, alterations to subunit configuration of GABAA receptors, uncoupling and internalisation of the benzodiazepine binding site from the GABAA receptor complex as well as changes in gene expression. The likelihood of dependence is relatively high with lorazepam compared to other benzodiazepines. Lorazepam's relatively short serum half- life, its confinement mainly to blood, and its inactive metabolite can result in interdose withdrawal phenomena and next-dose cravings, that may reinforce psychological dependence. Because of its high potency, the smallest lorazepam tablet strength of 0.5 mg is also a significant dose. To minimise the risk of physical/psychological dependence, lorazepam is best used only short-term, at the smallest effective dose. If any benzodiazepine has been used long-term, the recommendation is a gradual dose taper over a period of weeks, months or longer, according to dose and duration of use, the degree of dependence and the individual. Coming off long-term lorazepam use may be more realistically achieved by a gradual switch to an equivalent dose of diazepam and a period of stabilization on this, and only then initiating dose reductions. The advantage of switching to diazepam is that dose reductions are felt less acutely, because of the longer half-lives (20‚Äì200 hours) of diazepam and its active metabolites. = Withdrawal = On abrupt or overly rapid discontinuation of lorazepam, anxiety, and signs of physical withdrawal have been observed, similar to those seen on withdrawal from alcohol and barbiturates. Lorazepam, as with other benzodiazepine drugs, can cause physical dependence, addiction, and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. The higher the dose and the longer the drug is taken, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can, however, occur from standard dosages and also after short-term use. Benzodiazepine treatment should be discontinued as soon as possible via a slow and gradual dose reduction regimen. Rebound effects often resemble the condition being treated, but typically at a more intense level and may be difficult to diagnose. Withdrawal symptoms can range from mild anxiety and insomnia to more severe symptoms such as seizures and psychosis. The risk and severity of withdrawal are increased with long-term use, use of high doses, abrupt or over-rapid reduction, among other factors. Short-acting benzodiazepines such as lorazepam are more likely to cause a more severe withdrawal syndrome compared to longer-acting benzodiazepines. Withdrawal symptoms can occur after taking therapeutic doses of lorazepam for as little as one week. Withdrawal symptoms include headaches, anxiety, tension, depression, insomnia, restlessness, confusion, irritability, sweating, dysphoria, dizziness, derealization, depersonalization, numbness/tingling of extremities, hypersensitivity to light, sound, and smell, perceptual distortions, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, appetite loss, hallucinations, delirium, seizures, tremor, stomach cramps, myalgia, agitation, palpitations, tachycardia, panic attacks, short-term memory loss, and hyperthermia. It takes about 18‚Äì36 hours for the benzodiazepine to be removed from the body. The ease of addiction to lorazepam, (Ativan brand was particularly cited), and its withdrawal were brought to the attention of the British public during the early 1980s in Esther Rantzen's BBC TV series That's Life!, in a feature on the drug over a number of episodes. = Interactions = Lorazepam is not usually fatal in overdose, but may cause respiratory depression if taken in overdose with alcohol. The combination also causes greater enhancement of the disinhibitory and amnesic effects of both drugs, with potentially embarrassing or criminal consequences. Some experts advise that people should be warned against drinking alcohol while on lorazepam treatment, but such clear warnings are not universal. Greater adverse effects may also occur when lorazepam is used with other drugs, such as opioids or other hypnotics. Lorazepam may also interact with rifabutin. Valproate inhibits the metabolism of lorazepam, whereas carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and rifampin increase its rate of metabolism. Some antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and carbamazepine, sedative antihistamines, opiates, antipsychotics and alcohol, when taken with lorazepam may result in enhanced sedative effects. = Overdose = In cases of a suspected lorazepam overdose, it is important to establish whether the person is a regular user of lorazepam or other benzodiazepines since regular use causes tolerance to develop. Also, one must ascertain whether other substances were also ingested. Signs of overdose range through mental confusion, dysarthria, paradoxical reactions, drowsiness, hypotonia, ataxia, hypotension, hypnotic state, coma, cardiovascular depression, respiratory depression, and death. However, fatal overdoses on benzodiazepines alone are rare and less common than with barbiturates. Such a difference is largely due to benzodiazepine activity as a neuroreceptor modulator, and not as an activator per se. Lorazepam and similar medication do however act in synergy with alcohol, which increases the risk of overdose. Early management of people under alert includes emetics, gastric lavage, and activated charcoal. Otherwise, management is by observation, including of vital signs, support and, only if necessary, considering the hazards of doing so, giving intravenous flumazenil. People are ideally nursed in a kind, frustration-free environment, since, when given or taken in high doses, benzodiazepines are more likely to cause paradoxical reactions. If shown sympathy, even quite crudely feigned, people may respond solicitously, but they may respond with disproportionate aggression to frustrating cues. Opportunistic counseling has limited value here, as the person is unlikely to recall this later, owing to drug-induced anterograde amnesia. = Detection in body fluids = Lorazepam may be quantitated in blood or plasma to confirm poisoning in hospitalized people, provide evidence of an impaired driving arrest or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma concentrations are usually in a range of 10‚Äì300 Œºg/l in persons either receiving the drug therapeutically or in those arrested for impaired driving. Approximately 300‚Äì1000 Œºg/l is found in people after acute overdosage. Lorazepam may not be detected by commonly used urine drug screenings for benzodiazepines.  Pharmacology  Lorazepam has anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, amnesic, anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant properties. It is a high-potency and an benzodiazepine, and its uniqueness, advantages, and disadvantages are largely explained by its pharmacokinetic properties (poor water and lipid solubility, high protein binding and anoxidative metabolism to a pharmacologically inactive glucuronide form) and by its high relative potency (lorazepam 1 mg is equal in effect to diazepam 10 mg). The biological half-life of lorazepam is 10‚Äì20 hours. = Pharmacokinetics = Lorazepam is highly protein bound and is extensively metabolized into pharmacologically inactive metabolites. Due to its poor lipid solubility, lorazepam is absorbed relatively slowly by mouth and is unsuitable for rectal administration. However, its poor lipid solubility and high degree of protein binding (85‚Äì90%) mean its volume of distribution is mainly the vascular compartment, causing relatively prolonged peak effects. This contrasts with the highly lipid- soluble diazepam, which, although rapidly absorbed orally or rectally, soon redistributes from the serum to other parts of the body, in particular, body fat. This explains why one lorazepam dose, despite its shorter serum half- life, has more prolonged peak effects than an equivalent diazepam dose. Lorazepam is rapidly conjugated at its 3-hydroxy group into lorazepam glucuronide which is then excreted in the urine. Lorazepam glucuronide has no demonstrable CNS activity in animals. The plasma levels of lorazepam are proportional to the dose given. There is no evidence of accumulation of lorazepam on administration up to six months. On regular administration, diazepam will accumulate, since it has a longer half-life and active metabolites, these metabolites also have long half-lives. Clinical example: Diazepam has long been a drug of choice for status epilepticus; its high lipid solubility means it gets absorbed with equal speed whether given orally, or rectally (nonintravenous routes are convenient in outside hospital settings), but diazepam's high lipid solubility also means it does not remain in the vascular space, but soon redistributes into other body tissues. So, it may be necessary to repeat diazepam doses to maintain peak anticonvulsant effects, resulting in excess body accumulation. Lorazepam is a different case; its low lipid solubility makes it relatively slowly absorbed by any route other than intravenously, but once injected, it will not get significantly redistributed beyond the vascular space. Therefore, lorazepam's anticonvulsant effects are more durable, thus reducing the need for repeated doses. If a person is known to usually stop convulsing after only one or two diazepam doses, it may be preferable because sedative after effects will be less than if a single dose of lorazepam is given (diazepam anticonvulsant/sedative effects wear off after 15‚Äì30 minutes, but lorazepam effects last 12‚Äì24 hours). The prolonged sedation from lorazepam may, however, be an acceptable trade-off for its reliable duration of effects, particularly if the person needs to be transferred to another facility. Although lorazepam is not necessarily better than diazepam at initially terminating seizures, lorazepam is, nevertheless, replacing diazepam as the intravenous agent of choice in status epilepticus. Lorazepam serum levels are proportional to the dose administered. Giving 2 mg oral lorazepam will result in a peak total serum level of around 20 ng/ml around two hours later, half of which is lorazepam, half its inactive metabolite, lorazepam-glucuronide. A similar lorazepam dose given intravenously will result in an earlier and higher peak serum level, with a higher relative proportion of unmetabolised (active) lorazepam. On regular administration, maximum serum levels are attained after three days. Longer-term use, up to six months, does not result in further accumulation. On discontinuation, lorazepam serum levels become negligible after three days and undetectable after about a week. Lorazepam is metabolized in the liver by conjugation into inactive lorazepam-glucuronide. This metabolism does not involve liver oxidation, so is relatively unaffected by reduced liver function. Lorazepam-glucuronide is more water-soluble than its precursor, so gets more widely distributed in the body, leading to a longer half-life than lorazepam. Lorazepam-glucuronide is eventually excreted by the kidneys, and, because of its tissue accumulation, it remains detectable, particularly in the urine, for substantially longer than lorazepam. = Pharmacodynamics = Relative to other benzodiazepines, lorazepam is thought to have high affinity for GABA receptors, which may also explain its marked amnesic effects. Its main pharmacological effects are the enhancement of the effects of the neurotransmitter GABA at the GABAA receptor. Benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam, enhance the effects of GABA at the GABAA receptor via increasing the frequency of opening of the chloride ion channel on the GABAA receptors; which results in the therapeutic actions of benzodiazepines. They, however, do not on their own activate the GABAA receptors, but require the neurotransmitter GABA to be present. Thus, the effect of benzodiazepines is to enhance the effects of the neurotransmitter GABA. The magnitude and duration of lorazepam effects are dose-related, meaning larger doses have stronger and longer-lasting effects, because the brain has spare benzodiazepine drug receptor capacity, with single, clinical doses leading only to an occupancy of some 3% of the available receptors. The anticonvulsant properties of lorazepam and other benzodiazepines may be, in part or entirely, due to binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels rather than benzodiazepine receptors. Sustained repetitive firing seems to get limited, by the benzodiazepine effect of slowing recovery of sodium channels from inactivation to deactivation in mouse spinal cord cell cultures, hence prolonging the refractory period.  Physical properties and formulations  0.5 mg tablets of the Ativan brand of lorazepam Pure lorazepam is an almost white powder that is nearly insoluble in water and oil. In medicinal form, it is mainly available as tablets and a solution for injection, but, in some locations, it is also available as a skin patch, an oral solution, and a sublingual tablet. Lorazepam tablets and syrups are administered by mouth only. Lorazepam tablets of the Ativan brand also contain lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, polacrilin, magnesium stearate, and coloring agents (indigo carmine in blue tablets and tartrazine in yellow tablets). Lorazepam for injection formulated with polyethylene glycol 400 in propylene glycol with 2.0% benzyl alcohol as preservative. Lorazepam injectable solution is administered either by deep intramuscular injection or by intravenous injection. The injectable solution comes in 1 ml ampoules containing 2 or 4 mg of lorazepam. The solvents used are polyethylene glycol 400 and propylene glycol. As a preservative, the injectable solution contains benzyl alcohol.baxter.com ‚Äì Lorazepam Injection Data Sheet Toxicity from propylene glycol has been reported in the case of a person receiving a continuous lorazepam infusion. Intravenous injections should be given slowly and they should be closely monitored for side effects, such as respiratory depression, hypotension, or loss of airway control. Peak effects roughly coincide with peak serum levels, which occur 10 minutes after intravenous injection, up to 60 minutes after intramuscular injection, and 90 to 120 minutes after oral administration, but initial effects will be noted before this. A clinically relevant lorazepam dose will normally be effective for six to 12 hours, making it unsuitable for regular once-daily administration, so it is usually prescribed as two to four daily doses when taken regularly, but this may be extended to five or six, especially in the case of elderly people who could not handle large doses at once. Topical formulations of lorazepam, while used as treatment for nausea especially in people in hospice, ought not be used in this form and for this purpose as they have not been proven effective., which cites  History  1987 advertisement. \\"In a world where certainties are few...no wonder Ativan is prescribed by so many caring clinicians.\\" Historically, lorazepam is one of the \\"classical\\" benzodiazepines. Others include diazepam, clonazepam, oxazepam, nitrazepam, flurazepam, bromazepam, and clorazepate. Lorazepam was first introduced by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals in 1977 under the brand names Ativan and Temesta. The drug was developed by D.J. Richards, president of research. Wyeth's original patent on lorazepam is expired in the United States.  Society and culture  = Recreational use = Lorazepam is also used for other purposes, such as recreational use, wherein the drug is taken to achieve a high, or when the drug is continued long-term against medical advice. A large-scale, nationwide, U.S. government study of pharmaceutical-related emergency department (ED) visits by SAMHSA found sedative-hypnotics are the pharmaceuticals most frequently used outside of their prescribed medical purpose in the United States, with 35% of drug- related emergency department visits involving sedative-hypnotics. In this category, benzodiazepines are most commonly used. Males and females use benzodiazepines for nonmedical purposes equally. Of drugs used in attempted suicide, benzodiazepines are the most commonly used pharmaceutical drugs, with 26% of attempted suicides involving them. Lorazepam was the third-most-common benzodiazepine used outside of prescription in these ER visit statistics. = Legal status = Lorazepam is a Schedule IV drug under the Controlled Substances Act in the U.S. and internationally under the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances. It is a Schedule IV drug under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act in Canada. In the United Kingdom, it is a Class C, Schedule 4 Controlled Drug under the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001. = Pricing = In 2000, the U.S. drug company Mylan agreed to pay $147 million to settle accusations by the FTC that they had raised the price of generic lorazepam by 2600% and generic clorazepate by 3200% in 1998 after having obtained exclusive licensing agreements for certain ingredients.

The related adjective is androcentric, while the practice of placing the feminine point of view at the center is gynocentric.  Origin of the term  The term androcentrism was introduced as an analytic concept by Charlotte Perkins Gilman in a scientific debate. Perkins Gilman described androcentric practices in society and the resulting problems they created in her investigation on The Man-Made World; or, Our Androcentric Culture, published in 1911. Because of this androcentrism can be understood as a societal fixation on masculinity whereby all things originate. Under androcentrism, masculinity is normative and all things outside of masculinity are defined as other. According to Perkins Gilman, masculine patterns of life and masculine mindsets claimed universality while female patterns were considered as deviance.  Education  Some universities such as the University of Oxford consciously practiced a numerus clausus and restricted the number of female undergraduates they accepted.  Literature  Research by Dr. David Anderson and Dr. Mykol Hamilton has documented the under-representation of female characters in 200 top-selling children's books from 2001 and a seven-year sample of Caldecott award-winning books. There were nearly twice as many male main characters as female main characters, and male characters appeared in illustrations 53 percent more than female characters. Most of the plot-lines centered on the male characters and their experiences of life.  The arts  In 1985 a group of female artists from New York, the Guerrilla Girls, began to protest the under-representation of female artists. According to them, male artists and the male viewpoint continued to dominate the visual art world. In a 1989 poster (displayed on NYC buses) titled \\"Do women have to be naked to get into the Met. Museum?\\" They reported that less than 5% of the artists in the Modern Art sections of the Met Museum were women, but 85% of the nudes were female. Over 20 years later, women were still under-represented in the art world. In 2007, Jerry Saltz (journalist from the New York Times) criticized the Museum of Modern Art for undervaluing work by female artists. Of the 400 works of art he counted in the Museum of Modern Art, only 14 were by women (3.5%). Saltz also found a significant under-representation of female artists in the six other art institutions he studied.  Generic male language  In literature, the use of masculine language to refer to men, women, intersex, and non-binary may indicate a male or androcentic bias in society where men are seen as the 'norm', and women, intersex, and non-binary are seen as the 'other'. Philosophy scholar Jennifer Saul argued that the use of male generic language marginalizes women, intersex, and non-binary in society. In recent years, some writers have started to use more gender-inclusive language (for instance, using the pronouns they/them, and using gender-inclusive words like humankind, person, partner, spouse, businessperson, fire-fighter, chairperson and police- officer). Many studies have shown that male generic language is not interpreted as truly 'gender-inclusive.' Studies: Paper presented at a conference of the American Psychological Association, Los Angeles. * Psychological research has shown that, in comparison to unbiased terms such as \\"they\\" and \\"humankind,\\" masculine terms lead to male-biased mental imagery in the mind of both the listener and the communicator. Three studies by Mykol Hamilton show that there is not only a male ‚Üí people bias but also a people ‚Üí male bias. In other words, a masculine bias remains even when people are exposed to only gender neutral language (although the bias is lessened). In two of her studies, half of the participants (after exposure to gender neutral language) had male-biased imagery but the rest of the participants displayed no gender bias at all. In her third study, only males showed a masculine-bias (after exposure to gender neutral language) ‚Äì females showed no gender bias. Hamilton asserted that this may be due to the fact that males have grown up being able to think more easily than females of \\"any person\\" as generic \\"he,\\" since \\"he\\" applies to them. Further, of the two options for neutral language, neutral language that explicitly names women (e.g., \\"he or she\\") reduces androcentrism more effectively than neutral language that makes no mention of gender whatsoever (e.g., \\"human\\"). Feminist anthropologist Sally Slocum argues that there has been a longstanding male bias in anthropological thought as evidenced by terminology used when referring to society, culture and humankind.

It is mainly characterized by \\"different beat\\" that altered the harmonies with the introduction of unconventional chords and an innovative syncopation of traditional samba from a single rhythmic division. Therefore, the \\"bossa nova beat\\", then, is characteristic of a samba style and not of an autonomous genre. According to the Brazilian journalist Ruy Castro, the bossa beat ‚Äì which would be created by the drummer Milton Banana ‚Äì was \\"an extreme simplification of the beat of the samba school\\", as if all instruments had been removed and only the tamborim had been preserved. In line with this thesis, musicians such as Baden Powell, Roberto Menescal and Ronaldo B√¥scoli, also claim that this beat is related to the tamborim of the samba school. One of the major innovations of bossa nova was the way to synthesize the rhythm of samba on the classical guitar. According to musicologist Gilberto Mendes, the bossa nova was one of the \\"three rhythmic phases of samba\\", in which the \\"bossa beat\\" had been extracted by Jo√£o Gilberto from the traditional samba. According to the author Walter Garcia, the synthesis performed by Gilberto's guitar was a reduction of the \\"batucada\\" of samba, a stylization produced from one of the percussion instruments: the thumb stylized a surdo; the index, middle and ring fingers phrased like a tamborim. The bossa nova wave came to renow samba and to contribute to the modernization of Brazilian music, being a watershed. The style emerged at the time when samba-can√ß√£o was the dominant rhythm in the Brazilian music scene. Its first appearance was on the album Can√ß√£o do Amor Demais, in which the singer Elizeth Cardoso recorded two specifically compositions by the duo Antonio Carlos Jobim and Vinicius de Moraes, \\"Outra Vez\\" and \\"Chega de Saudade\\", which were accompanied by Jo√£o Gilberto's guitar. It was the first time that the Bahian musician presented the beat of his guitar that would become characteristic of the style. By accompanying Cardoso's voice, Gilberto innovated in the way of pacing the rhythm, accentuating the weak times, in order to carry out a synthesis of the beat of samba to guitar. Months later, Jo√£o Gilberto's first compact was released, containing the tracks \\"Chega de Saudade\\" and \\"Bim Bom\\". Considered the landmark of the birth of bossa nova, it also featured Gilberto's innovative way of singing samba, which was inspired by Dorival Caymmi. With the LP Chega de Saudade, released in 1959, Gilberto consolidated the bossa nova as a new style of playing samba. His innovative way of playing and singing samba, combined with the harmonies of Antonio Carlos Jobim and the lyrics of Vinicius de Moraes, found immediate resonance among musicians who were looking for new approaches to samba in Rio de Janeiro, many of them were influenced by American jazz. Then, it emerged an artistic movement around Gilberto and others professional artists such as Jobim, Moraes and Baden Powell, among others, which attracted young amateur musicians from the South Zone of Rio ‚Äì such as Carlos Lyra, Roberto Menescal, Ronaldo Boscoli and Nara Le√£o.  Etymology  Bossa nova rhythmBlatter, Alfred (2007). Revisiting music theory: a guide to the practice, p.28. . In Brazil, the word \\"bossa\\" is old-fashioned slang for something done with particular charm, natural flair or innate ability. As early as 1932, Noel Rosa used the word in a samba: > \\"O samba, a prontid√£o e outras bossas s√£o nossas coisas, s√£o coisas nossas.\\" > (\\"Samba, readiness and other bossas are our things, are things from us.\\") The phrase bossa nova means literally \\"new trend\\" or \\"new wave\\". The exact origin of the term \\"bossa nova\\" remained unclear for many decades, according to some authors. Within the artistic beach culture of the late 1950s in Rio de Janeiro, the term \\"bossa\\" was used to refer to any new \\"trend\\" or \\"fashionable wave\\". In his book Bossa Nova, Brazilian author Ruy Castro asserts that \\"bossa\\" was already in use in the 1950s by musicians as a word to characterize someone's knack for playing or singing idiosyncratically.Castro, Ruy (transl. by Lysa Salsbury). Bossa Nova: The Story of the Brazilian Music That Seduced the World. 2000. 1st English language edition. A Capella Books, an imprint of Chicago Review Press, Inc. First published in Brasil by Companhia das Letras (1990) Castro claims that the term \\"bossa nova\\" might have first been used in public for a concert given in 1957 by the Grupo Universit√°rio Hebraico do Brasil (Hebrew University Group of Brazil). The authorship of the term \\"bossa nova\\" is attributed to the then-young journalist Moyses Fuks, who was promoting the event.\\"Moyses Fuks\\" That group consisted of Sylvia Telles, Carlos Lyra, Nara Le√£o, Luiz E√ßa, Roberto Menescal, and others. Mr. Fuks's description, fully supported by most of the bossa nova members, simply read \\"HOJE. SYLVIA TELLES E UN GRUPO BOSSA NOVA\\" (\\"Today. Sylvia Telles and a 'Bossa Nova' group\\"), since Sylvia Telles was the most famous musician in the group at that time. In 1959, Nara Le√£o also participated in more than one embryonic display of bossa nova. These include the 1st Festival de Samba Session, conducted by the student union of Pontif√≠cia Universidade Cat√≥lica. This session was chaired by Carlos Diegues (later a prominent Cinema Novo film director), a law student whom Le√£o ultimately married.\\"Nara Le√£o\\"  Instruments  = Classical guitar = Bossa nova is most commonly performed on the nylon-string classical guitar, played with the fingers rather than with a pick. Its purest form could be considered unaccompanied guitar with vocals, as created, pioneered, and exemplified by Jo√£o Gilberto. Even in larger, jazz- like arrangements for groups, there is almost always a guitar that plays the underlying rhythm. Gilberto basically took one of the several rhythmic layers from a samba ensemble, specifically the tamborim, and applied it to the picking hand. According to Brazilian musician Paulo Bitencourt, Jo√£o Gilberto, known for his eccentricity and obsessed by the idea of finding a new way of playing the guitar, sometimes locked himself in the bathroom, where he played one and the same chord for many hours in a row. = Drums and percussion = As in samba, the surdo plays an ostinato figure on the downbeat of beat one, the \\"ah\\" of beat one, the downbeat of beat two and the \\"ah\\" of beat two. The clave pattern sounds very similar to the two-three or three-two son clave of Cuban styles such as mambo but is dissimilar in that the \\"two\\" side of the clave is pushed by an eighth note. Also important in the percussion section for bossa nova is the cabasa, which plays a steady sixteenth-note pattern. These parts are easily adaptable to the drum set, which makes bossa nova a rather popular Brazilian style for drummers.  Structure  Certain other instrumentations and vocals are also part of the structure of bossa nova: = Bossa nova and samba = Basic bossa nova accompaniment pattern Bossa nova has at its core a rhythm based on samba. Samba combines the rhythmic patterns and feel originating in former African slave communities. Samba's emphasis on the second beat carries through to bossa nova (to the degree that it is often notated in 2/4 time). However, unlike samba, bossa nova has no dance steps to accompany it.\\"Step one, pour yourself a drink\\", Mark Collin, The Guardian, 27 June 2008 When played on the guitar, in a simple one-bar pattern, the thumb plays the bass notes on 1 and 2, while the fingers pluck the chords in unison on the two eighth notes of beat one, followed by the second sixteenth note of beat two. Two-measure patterns usually contain a syncopation into the second measure. Overall, the rhythm has a \\"swaying\\" feel rather than the \\"swinging\\" feel of jazz. As bossa nova composer Carlos Lyra describes it in his song \\"Influ√™ncia do Jazz\\", the samba rhythm moves \\"side to side\\" while jazz moves \\"front to back\\". Bossa nova was also influenced by the blues, but because the most famous bossa novas lack the 12-bar structure characteristic of classic blues, as well as the statement, repetition and rhyming resolution of lyrics typical of the genre, bossa nova's affinity with the blues often passes unnoticed.\\"Blues and Samba: Another Side of Bossa Nova History\\" article by Bryan McCann, from the Luso-Brazilian Review, cited in the Project MUSE (in Portuguese) = Vocals = Aside from the guitar style, Jo√£o Gilberto's other innovation was the projection of the singing voice. Prior to bossa nova, Brazilian singers employed brassy, almost operatic styles. Now, the characteristic nasal vocal production of bossa nova is a peculiar trait of the caboclo folk tradition of northeastern Brazil.\\"Caboclos refers to the mixed- race population (Indians or Africans 'imported' to the region during the slave era, and Europeans) who generally live along the Amazon's riverbanks.\\" From \\"Two Cases on Participatory Municipal Planning on natural-resource management in the Brazilian Amazon\\", by GRET ‚Äì Groupe de Recherche et d'√âchanges Technologiques, France (in English)Oxford Music Online article (subscription only) = Themes and lyrics = The lyrical themes found in bossa nova include women, love, longing, homesickness, nature. Bossa Nova was often apolitical. The musical lyrics of the late 1950s depicted the easy life of the middle to upper-class Brazilians, though the majority of the population was in the working class. However, in conjunction with political developments of the early 1960s (especially the 1964 military coup d'√©tat), the popularity of bossa nova was eclipsed by M√∫sica popular brasileira, a musical genre that appeared around the mid-1960s, featuring lyrics that were more politically charged, referring explicitly to working class struggle.

He was a son of Annie Elizabeth May (Richards) and former Premier, W. A. C. Bennett. He was a 3rd cousin, twice removed, of R.B. Bennett, eleventh Prime Minister of Canada. Following his father's resignation, Bill Bennett was elected on September 7, 1973, as the British Columbia Social Credit League Member of the British Columbia Legislative Assembly for South Okanagan. His father was also named William but was usually called \\"W.A.C.\\" in the media or \\"Ceece\\" by his friends.*W.A.C.: Bennett and the rise of British Columbia, David J. Mitchell () To distinguish the son from his father, he was usually called \\"Bill.\\" Some in the media referred to the younger Bennett as \\"Mini-Wac,\\" which was derived from another of his father's nicknames, \\"Wacky.\\" The nickname was created by his opponents but also embraced by some supporters. Leader of Social Credit Party He was elected the leader of the Socred Party in November 1973, at a convention in Whistler, British Columbia. This convention also changed the name of the party to the British Columbia Social Credit Party. Bennett set about establishing a political organization modelled closely on and using staff lent by Bill Davis's Ontario \\"Big Blue Machine.\\" Bennett's organization was called the \\"Baby Blue Machine.\\" He embraced a new coalition of Liberals, social conservatives, and the corporate sector, unlike his father, who had appealed to the populist base. Premier of British Columbia He became premier of the province in the 1975 election when his party defeated the New Democratic Party of Premier David Barrett. In the election of May 10, 1979, the Social Credit Party was re-elected with a reduced majority, followed by another one in the 1983 election. He served until August 6, 1986. In 1978, Bennett was instrumental in establishing the BC Winter Games and BC Summer Games.https://www.bcgames.org/Games/MedalsandAwards/WRBennettAward.aspx As a result, an award was named in his honour in which he presented the award in 2008 in his hometown, Kelowna, where the BC Summer Games were being hosted that year. His cabinet included politicians new to the provincial scene who would soon become some of BC's most prominent political players. They included Pat McGeer, Grace McCarthy, Bill Vander Zalm, Garde Gardom, Rafe Mair, and Jim Nielsen. Inspired by conservative economist Milton Friedman, his government passed a series of laws, known as the \\"Restraint\\" program, which slashed social services and gutted labour laws in response to economic woes in 1983, provoking a general strike, which further crippled the economy. To justify massive education cuts, Bennett blamed many of the province's difficulties on public school teachers, an argument that deeply split the electorate In several television interviews, he labeled those who disagreed with his policies as \\"bad British Columbians.\\" On the other hand, his ostensibly- antisocialist government spent hundreds of millions of dollars to bring Expo 86 to Vancouver and related projects including BC Place, the city's SkyTrain rapid transit system, and the Vancouver Trade and Convention Centre. His government also built the Coquihalla Highway at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars with non-union Kerkhoff Construction Company as the main contractor. It distributed free shares to British Columbians for the British Columbia Resources Investment Corporation (BCRIC). His government also spent over $1 billion on the Northeast coal project to create jobs. Critics noted that by creating only 1,000 jobs, each job cost taxpayers $1 million. Controversies In 1996, Bill Bennett was convicted under BC securities laws of insider trading involving the sale of shares in Doman Securities, a Duncan, BC company, ten years after he stepped down as premier. That was known as the Doman Scandal.CBC Digital Archives A British Columbia Securities Commission panel imposed trading sanctions against Russell James Bennett and Harbanse Singh Doman and ordered them along with Bill Bennett to pay the commission $1 million to cover the costs of an insider trading case that spanned 11 years.Commission Panel Issue Consent Orders In Bennett-Doman Insider Trading Case. BCSC. Retrieved 21Aug, 2010 British Columbia Resources Investment Corporation (BCRIC or \\"Brick\\") (Social Credit Party), a holding company formed under the government of William R. Bennett, was a public boondoggle involving publicly l-distributed and soon-worthless shares of a former Crown Corporation. Shares briefly rallied and then dropped and settled at less than one dollar. Bennett's tenure also included megaprojects such as the Coquihalla Highway, which cost approximately $848 million. Retirement Though still reviled by the left, Bennett remains generally highly respected among conservatives in BC, who view his rule as a \\"golden era\\" before compared to the governments of Social Credit premier Bill Vander Zalm and the New Democratic Party premiers that succeeded him. In his later years Bennett advised past BC Premier Gordon Campbell, who openly stated his desire to emulate the policies associated with Bennett's government.

He was the 25th Premier of British Columbia. With just over 20 years in office, Bennett was and remains the longest-serving premier in British Columbia history. He was usually referred to as W. A. C. Bennett, although some referred to him either affectionately or mockingly as \\"Wacky\\" Bennett. To his close friends, he was known as \\"Cece\\". Early and family life Bennett was born in Hastings, New Brunswick, Canada, one of five children of Andrew Havelock Bennett and Mary Emma Burns. His father was a third cousin of Richard Bedford Bennett, eleventh Prime Minister of Canada. He left formal school in grade nine, during the First World War, to take a job in a hardware store, but would pursue correspondence courses as an adult to improve his knowledge and job potential.Bowering's B.C.: A Swashbuckling History, by George Bowering, Toronto 1996, Penguin Canada, , pp. 299-300. He joined the Air Force but the war ended before he saw active duty. At the age of 18, he and his family moved to Edmonton, Alberta and then to Westlock, Alberta, where Bennett's father operated a hardware store. In 1927 Bennett married Annie Elizabeth May Richards, known as \\"May\\". In 1930 they moved to Victoria and then Kelowna with their two children, Anita and R.J. A third child, William (\\"Bill\\") was born in 1932. In Kelowna he joined the local Gyro Club, Masonic Lodge, the Kelowna Club, and was active in the United Church of Canada. Early business career Bennett opened a hardware store in 1927, in partnership with another man, and married May Bennett soon afterwards.Bowering's B.C.: A Swashbuckling History, by George Bowering, Toronto 1996, Penguin Canada, , pp. 300. Bennett sold his interest just before the 1929 Stock Market crash, fled the tough Alberta economic conditions, and soon moved to Kelowna, British Columbia where he opened his own hardware store, Bennett's Hardware. A successful merchant, he served as President of the Kelowna Board of Trade from 1937 to 1939. In 1932 Bennett, Giuseppe Guezzi, and Pasquale \\"Cap\\" Capozzi established a wine-making company to produce wine from the vast surplus of Okanagan apples going to waste during the Depression.Calona Vineyards - history Three years later Bennett and Capozzi, both teetotalers, concluded that there was no market for their apple wines and switched to making wines from California grapes. In 1936 they established Calona Wines, the name a phonetic spelling of Kelowna. Bennett departed the company in 1940 to enter politics. Enters politics Bennett tried for the British Columbia Conservative Party's South Okanagan nomination for the 1937 provincial election for the British Columbia Legislative Assembly, but was unsuccessful. For the 1941 election, he won the nomination and the election. Following the election, the Conservative and Liberal parties voted to henceforth govern in coalition, an arrangement formally titled the British Columbia Coalition Organization.Bowering's B.C.: A Swashbuckling History, by George Bowering, Toronto 1996, Penguin Canada, , pp. 300-301. As a coalitionist, Bennett was re-elected in 1945, but vacated the seat in 1948 in order to run, unsuccessfully, as Progressive Conservative candidate in the Yale federal by-election of that year. Regaining the Coalition nomination for the South Okanagan seat, Bennett was returned to the British Columbia Legislative Assembly in the 1949 provincial election. After failing in his bid to become leader of the provincial Progressive Conservative Party in 1951, he left the party to sit as an independent member. In December of that year, he took out a membership in the Social Credit League. Social Credit leader and premier Commencing with the 1952 provincial election, the province used an alternative vote system that had been designed to enable the Conservative and Liberal parties to keep the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation out of power. What the Liberals and Conservatives failed to reckon with, however, was what CCF voters would do with their second preferences. In the election, the CCF's second preferences went overwhelmingly to Social Credit, making them the largest party with 19 seats out of a total of 48. The Socreds succeeded in convincing an Independent Labour Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) to support them and so were able to form a minority government. Not even the Socreds had expected to win the election. They had gone into the campaign without a full-time leader; their nominal leader had been Ernest George Hansell, a federal MP from Alberta. Party president Lyle Wicks convened a meeting of the newly elected MLAs to elect the province's new premier. Bennett, one of only three Socred MLAs who had any previous experience in the legislature, was elected party leader and premier-designate on July 15, 1952. Of the 19 votes cast, Bennett received 10, another received 2, and two more (including Philip Gaglardi) one vote each. On August 1, he was sworn in as Premier of British Columbia, an office he went on to hold for 20 years. In order to get a stronger mandate, Bennett deliberately engineered the defeat of his initial minority government with a school funding proposal, forcing an election for June 1953. Social Credit was re-elected with a clear majority. Preferential voting was not used in BC again as Bennett, who had profited from the system, abandoned it following his 1953 victory. The Social Credit Party won seven consecutive elections during W. A. C. Bennett's involvement and leadership: 1952, 1953, 1956, 1960, 1963, 1966, and 1969. The only election Bennett lost as a member of Social Credit was in 1972, the last election in which he was a candidate. =Political ideology= While the Social Credit party was founded to promote the social credit theories of monetary reform, these could not be implemented at the provincial level, as the Alberta Social Credit Party had learned in the 1930s. Bennett quickly converted the provincial party into a populist conservative party, and it became a vehicle for those who sought to keep the CCF out of power. However, as leader of the Social Credit Party of Canada's second most powerful provincial branch, he spoke for the party in federal election campaigns. During the 1957 election, he spoke for the party at a rally in Regina, Saskatchewan. In the 1965 election, Bennett and his cabinet ministers toured BC to encourage voters to elect Social Credit MPs to promote BC's interests. The cabinets of the Bennett governments over 20 years had several memorable ministers, including the flamboyant \\"Flying Phil\\" Gaglardi, who oversaw the rapid expansion of highways throughout the province and a similar expansion of BC Ferries. In 1960, the Bennett government introduced British Columbia's first provincial flag, the first official provincial flag adopted west of Quebec.List of Canadian flags#Provincial =Financial policy= A fiscal conservative, he served also as the Minister of Finance, keeping tight control over government spending, while leading his province into an era of modernization and prosperity. His practice of \\"pay as you go\\" carefully tracked spending, transferred debts to other government agencies, which allowed Bennett in 1959 to claim that the province was debt free.\\"William Andrew Cecil Bennett\\". Canadian Encyclopedia, Patricia E. Roy 10/31/2010 =Government expansion= Bennett's governments undertook a series of nationalizations to create provincial Crown corporations, including BC Ferries (1960) and BC Hydro (1961). BC Rail, formerly the Pacific Great Eastern Railway, owned by the province since 1918, underwent a series of major expansions. His Minister of Highways, Phil Gaglardi, oversaw major highway expansions and improvements. Major hydro- electric dam-building projects were undertaken on the Columbia and Peace Rivers. Bennett was instrumental in establishing the Bank of British Columbia with the government taking a 25% ownership. Bennett advocated in 1955 for a universal medical, dental, hospital, and pharmaceutical insurance coverage. Universal, publicly funded medical and hospital insurance was introduced as part of the federal government's creation of what became known as Medicare. The provincial government introduced a retail sales tax to fund the program. Post-secondary education institutions were created and expanded in the 1960s, including the addition of BC's second and third degree-granting universities: the University of Victoria in 1963 and Simon Fraser University in 1965. =Columbia River Treaty= In 1961 the Columbia River Treaty was signed by Canada and the United States. Although the signatories were the federal governments of Canada and the United States, Premier Bennett was reported to have played a major part in the negotiations. Under the provisions of the treaty, the U.S. paid British Columbia C$275 million (plus interest) for the downstream power generation rights over the following 30 years. BC used the money to fund construction of dams on the Columbia River for power generation and flood control. =BC-Canada relations= Bennett proposed that Canada be considered as a group of regions instead of provinces: Atlantic Canada, Quebec, Ontario, Western Canada, and BC. He also proposed that the four western provinces be expanded north, with BC absorbing the Yukon Territory. Although there were no concrete results, the concept of different regions, instead of provinces, has become part of how Canadians discuss the country. BC hosted the 1971 constitutional conference in Victoria. From this emerged the Victoria Charter, the most far-reaching federal-provincial agreement on constitutional amendment since Confederation. Bennett advocated that BC should have a veto over constitutional amendments, along with Ontario and Quebec. Post-premiership Bennett Memorial at Kelowna Memorial Park CemeteryFollowing his party's defeat in the 1972 election by Dave Barrett's revitalized New Democratic Party (the successor to the CCF), he served as Leader of the Opposition until resigning his seat as member for South Okanagan in June 1973. His son, W.R. \\"Bill\\" Bennett, won the South Okanagan by-election in September. W. A. C. Bennett retired as leader of the Social Credit Party on November 15, and his son Bill Bennett was elected leader of the BC Social Credit Party on November 24, 1973. NDP Premier Dave Barrett dropped the writ and sought re-election in the fall of 1975, the Socreds were returned to power with 35 seats in the 55-seat Legislature, and W. A. C.'s son Bill became the new Premier of British Columbia, inheriting his father's mantle of power as well as many of his father's cabinet members. In 1976, W. A. C. Bennett was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. He died in 1979, and was interred in the Kelowna Municipal Cemetery, in Kelowna, British Columbia. In 1998, the Government of Canada honoured W. A. C. Bennett with his portrait on a postage stamp of Canada. The W. A. C. Bennett Dam near Hudson's Hope, built under the Two River Policy, is named after him. The library at the Burnaby campus of Simon Fraser University also bears his name. He was featured on the cover of Time Magazine on September 30, 1966.

The town lies on the River Bollin, in the east of the county on the edge of the Cheshire Plain, with Macclesfield Forest to its east. It is around south of Manchester city centre and to the east of Chester. Before the Norman Conquest, Macclesfield was held by Edwin, Earl of Mercia and was assessed at ¬£8. The manor is recorded in the Domesday Book as \\"Maclesfeld\\", meaning \\"Maccel's open country\\". The medieval town grew up on the hilltop around what is now St Michael's Church. It was granted a charter by Edward I in 1261, before he became king. Macclesfield Grammar School was founded in 1502. The town had a silk-button industry from at least the middle of the 17th century, and became a major silk-manufacturing centre from the mid-18th century. The Macclesfield Canal was constructed in 1826‚Äì31. Hovis breadmakers were another Victorian employer. Modern industries include pharmaceuticals. Multiple mill buildings are still standing, and several of the town's museums explore the local silk industry. Other landmarks include Georgian buildings such as the Town Hall and former Sunday School; St Alban's Church, designed by Augustus Pugin; and the Arighi Bianchi furniture shop. The population of Macclesfield at the 2011 census was 51,482. A person from Macclesfield is sometimes referred to as a \\"Maxonian\\". \\"Maxonian\\" was originally coined to identify a group of alumni of King's School, Macclesfield at Oxford University as a portmanteau of Macclesfield and Oxonian, which was then applied to residents of the town in general. Macclesfield, like many other areas in Cheshire, is a relatively affluent town.macclesfield express town_flying_high Toponymy Situated in the ancient Hundred of Hamestan, the town is recorded in the Domesday Book as \\"Maclesfeld\\" and in 1183 it was referred to as \\"Makeslesfeld\\".Scholes (2000). page 104. The English Place-Name Society gives its name as being derived from the Old English name, Maccel, and field, yielding the meaning \\"Maccel's open country\\". Although \\"Silk Town\\" seems to be its preferred nickname, the traditional nickname of Macclesfield is \\"Treacle Town\\". This refers to an historical incident when a horse-drawn wagon overturned and spilt its load of treacle onto the street, after which the poor scooped the treacle off the road. History Before the Norman Conquest, Macclesfield was held by Edwin, Earl of Mercia, who also held much of the east of the county.Bu'Lock, pp. 71‚Äì72 Three crosses survive from this period, originally located in Sutton, and J. D. Bu'Lock speculates that there might have been a Pre-Conquest church.Bu'Lock, pp. 80, 84, Plate 18 The area was devastated by the Normans in 1070, and had not recovered by 1086; the Domesday Book records the manor as having fallen in value from ¬£8 to 20 shillings.Husain, pp. 11‚Äì12, 34 Hugh d'Avranches, Earl of Chester held the manor himself after the Conquest; there was a mill, meadow for oxen, and woodland 6 leagues by 4 leagues.Husain, pp. 17, 23, 25, 28 A Norman castle was built at Macclesfield.Husain, pp. 99, 101 Macclesfield was granted a borough charter by Ranulf de Blondeville, Earl of Chester, in the early 13th century, and in 1261 a second charter was granted by the future King Edward I, allowing a market, fair and judicial court.Hewitt, pp. 69‚Äì70Hartwell et al., pp. 449‚Äì51 The medieval town stood on the hilltop, centred on the parish church of All Saints, which was built in 1278, an extension of a chapel built in approximately 1220. In 1357, a hall was built in the town for the mayor's court and the borough court (portmote). The town lacked industries at this date and was described as poor, remaining a small market town until the end of the 15th century, with a population numbered in the hundreds.Driver, pp. 43‚Äì45, 109 The borough had a weekly market and two annual fairs: the Barnaby fair on St Barnabas day (11 June), the other on the feast of All Souls (2 November).Driver, p. 109Beck, p. 72 In recent years the Barnaby fair has been reinvented as the Barnaby Festival, a cultural festival in mid-June. The weekly market no longer happens but on the last Sunday of each month the Treacle Market is held, a large market selling locally produced food and handmade items such as clothing, handmade goods and pottery. Macclesfield was the administrative centre of the Hundred of Macclesfield, which occupied most of east Cheshire.Clayton, D. J. (1990). pages 32, 33. The Earl of Chester's manor of Macclesfield was very large, and its boundary extended to Disley. The manor house was on the edge of the deer park, on the west of the town. In the 14th century, it had a king's chamber and a queeen's hall, as well as a large stable, and the manor served as a stud farm for Edward the Black Prince.Hewitt, pp. 31, 35 The Earls of Chester established the Forest of Macclesfield, which was much larger than its present-day namesake. It was used for hunting deer and pasturing sheep and cattle. By the end of the 13th century, large areas of the forest had been ploughed because of the pressure of population growth. In 1356, two trees from the forest were given to archer William Jauderell to repair his home. Macclesfield as viewed from the railway station Macclesfield Castle was a fortified town house built by John de Macclesfield in the later Middle Ages. Construction began in 1398, and that year an application was made for a licence to crenellate, or fortify, the building. Two chantries were founded in the town: one in 1422 by the Legh family, and one in 1504 by Thomas Savage.Driver, p. 136 In 1502, Macclesfield Grammar School was founded by Sir John Percyvale. No proof exists that Macclesfield was ever a walled town. When the settlement was first established and for some centuries afterwards there would have certainly been some sort of ditch and palisade round the western side of the town which was not naturally defended. This was necessary in order to keep out undesirable people and stray animals. No physical trace of a ditch remains though measurements and the shape of certain streets suggest where such a ditch could have been and most of the medieval building were within this area. It is unlikely that the ditch and palisade were succeeded by a wall for no record has been found of a murage tax, which would certainly have been levied to keep the wall in repair. The suffix \\"Gate\\" in the names of several Macclesfield streets has been taken to indicate the former presence of a gate in the sense of a guarded opening in a wall, however, this is very unlikely as the term 'gate' is derived from 'gata', Scandinavian for road, which became gate in Middle English.A history of Macclesfield. Macclesfield Borough Council, edited by Clarice Stella Davies, University of Manchester Press, 1961. Therefore, Chester Gate, the Jordan Gate and the Church Wall Gate (some sources give the name Well Gate for this gate), are simply referring to the road to/from Chester or the road leading from the church to the well. These names are preserved in the names of three streets in the town, Chestergate, Jordangate and Back Wallgate.Streets and houses of old Macclesfield. John Earles, 1915. Republished MTD Rigg Publications, Leeds, 1990. A charter of 1595 established a town governing body consisting of the mayor, two aldermen and 24 \\"capital burgesses\\", and the powers of this body were increased by a charter of 1684.Hodson, p. 100 By the Tudor era, Macclesfield was prospering, with industries including the manufacture of harnesses, gloves and especially buttons, and later ribbons, tapes and fancy ware.Beck, pp. 52‚Äì53Hodson, p. 149 Coal was mined from the 16th century.Hodson, p. 142 In 1664, the population was around 2,600, making Macclesfield the third-largest town in the county, after Chester and Nantwich, although the town had expanded little from its medieval extent and had fewer large houses than Nantwich and Stockport.Hodson, pp. 93, 95 By around 1720, the number of households had increased to 925, and this rapid population growth continued throughout the 18th century, reaching 8,743 in 1801.Hodson, p. 109 In the 1580s, Macclesfield was one of the earliest towns in the county to have Puritan preaching \\"Exercises\\", and it was also an early centre for the Quakers. By 1718 an estimated 10% of the population was Nonconformist.Hodson, pp. 29, 31, 36‚Äì37 Towards the end of that century, the town had a large Methodist congregation, and Christ Church was the only Anglican church in the county to invite John Wesley to preach.Hodson, pp. 41‚Äì43 Armoury Towers During the Civil War, in 1642 the town was occupied for the King by Sir Thomas Aston, a Royalist. In the Jacobite Rising of 1745, Charles Stuart and his army marched through Macclesfield as they attempted to reach London. The mayor was forced to welcome the prince, and the event is commemorated in one of the town's silk tapestries.Silk Tapestries of Macclesfield. Retrieval Date: 15 October 2007. Armoury Towers was completed in 1858 and the Bridge Street drill hall was completed in 1871. =Industry= Paradise Mill Macclesfield was once the world's biggest producer of finished silk. A domestic button industry had been established in the town by the mid-16th century, although the first mention of silk buttons is not until 1649. In the mid-18th century, when metal buttons became fashionable, the silk-button industry transitioned to silk manufacture in mills. Macclesfield's first silk mill was founded by Charles Roe in 1743 or 1744.Hodson, pp. 109, 149‚Äì50 The mills were initially powered by water, and later by steam. There were 71 silk mills operating in 1832, employing 10,000 people, but a crash occurred in 1851 and many mill-workers emigrated to the American silk town of Paterson, New Jersey. The silk industry remained active in the town in the 1980s, but no longer dominated.Tigwell, pp. 15, 17, 68‚Äì69 Paradise Mill reopened in 1984 as a working mill museum, demonstrating the art of silk throwing and Jacquard weaving.Paradise Mill website. Retrieval Date: 15 October 2007.Tigwell, p. 140 The four Macclesfield Museums display a range of information and products from that period. A short-lived copper-smelting operation was established by Roe in 1750, processing ore from mines at Alderley Edge and Ecton (Staffordshire), and later from Anglesey. The business switched to copper processing and the manufacture of brass in 1767, before closing after Roe's death in 1781. The industry is reflected in some of the town's street names.Hodson, pp. 144‚Äì45 Between 1826 and 1831 the Macclesfield Canal was constructed, linking Macclesfield to Marple to the north and Kidsgrove to the south. The canal was surveyed for its Act of Parliament by the canal and roads engineer Thomas Telford, and built by William Crosley (junior), the Macclesfield Canal Company's engineer. It was the last narrow canal to be completed and had only limited success because within ten years much of the coal and other potential cargo was increasingly being transported by rail. Hovis Mill on the Macclesfield Canal in the town. Macclesfield is the original home of Hovis breadmakers, produced in Publicity Works Mill (commonly referred to as \\"the Hovis Mill\\") on the canal close to Buxton Road. It was founded by a Macclesfield businessman and a baker from Stoke-on-Trent. Hovis is said to derive from the Latin \\"homo-vitalis\\" (strength for man) as a way of providing a cheap and nutritious food for poor mill workers and was a very dry and dense wholemeal loaf completely different from the modern version. Waters Green was once home to a nationally known horse market which features in the legend of the Wizard of Alderley Edge. Waters Green and an area opposite Arighi Bianchi, now hidden under the Silk Road, also held a sheep and cattle market until the 1980s. Macclesfield is said to be the only mill town to have escaped bombing in World War II. After the war, two pharmaceutical companies opened facilities in Macclesfield, Geigy (now part of Novartis) and the pharmaceutical division of ICI (now AstraZeneca).Tigwell, pp. 15, 55 Governance Macclesfield was first represented in Parliament after the Reform Act of 1832, when it was granted two members of Parliament. This situation lasted until 1880, when after problems at the general election that year it was decided to declare the election void and suspend the writ of election (so no by-election could take place). In September 1880 a Royal Commission was appointed to investigate further. A report of March 1881 confirmed the allegations of corruption. As a result, the borough constituency was disenfranchised for corruption. The disenfranchisement took effect on 25 June 1885, when the town was transferred to the East Cheshire constituency. However under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 the Macclesfield constituency was recreated with extended boundaries, as a county division, later in 1885. From the 1885 general election it has elected one MP. Macclesfield was for some time considered to be a safe seat for the Conservative Party, having been held by it since the 1918 general election, but the 2017 election showed a significant swing away from the Conservatives. Currently, Macclesfield is represented by David Rutley, a Conservative and practising Mormon.macclesfieldexpress Rutley_plans_to_act_differently. He was selected for this seat in 2010, when Sir Nicholas Winterton, who had been the incumbent for 38 years, announced his retirement following unfavourable press coverage relating to the claiming of Parliamentary expenses. Sir Nicholas' wife, Anne Winterton, held the neighbouring seat of Congleton. Macclesfield was governed locally by Macclesfield Municipal Borough (see Macclesfield (borough) until 1974 when Macclesfield Borough Council was established, a local government district with borough status. Following the establishment of Cheshire East Council in 2009 the borough was abolished and the Mayoralty transferred to charter trustees. Macclesfield Town Council was established in 2015 following a community governance review which established a civil parish. Macclesfield Town Council is controlled by the Labour Party, with 9 councillors. There are 3 Independent councillors, and no Conservatives. Macclesfield is also represented by 12 councillors on Cheshire East Council: 9 Labour, 3 Independents.

The , or the GEACPS, was an imperialist concept which was developed in the Empire of Japan and propagated to Asian populations which were occupied by it from 1931 to 1945. It extended across the Asia-Pacific and promoted the cultural and economic unity of East Asians, Southeast Asians, South Asians and Oceanians. It also declared the intention to create a self-sufficient bloc of Asian nations which would be led by the Japanese and this bloc would also be free from the rule of Western powers. The idea was announced in a radio address which was titled \\"The International Situation and Japan's Position\\" and delivered by Foreign Minister Hachir≈ç Arita on 29 June 1940. The intent and practical implementation of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere varied widely depending on the group and government department involved. Policy theorists who conceived it, as well as the vast majority of the Japanese population at large saw it for its pan-Asian ideals of freedom and independence from Western colonial oppression. In practice, however, it was frequently used by militarists and nationalists, who saw an effective policy vehicle through which to strengthen Japan's position and advance its dominance within Asia. The latter approach was reflected in a policy document released by Japan's Ministry of Health and Welfare, An Investigation of Global Policy with the Yamato Race as Nucleus, which laid out the central position of Japan within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and promoted the idea of Japanese superiority over other Asians. Development of the concept 1935 poster of Manchukuo promoting harmony between Japanese, Chinese, and Manchu. The caption, written from right to left, says: \\"With the help of Japan, China, and Manchukuo, the world can be in peace.\\" The flags shown are, left to right: the flag of Manchukuo; the flag of Japan; the \\"Five Races Under One Union\\" flag of China. Much as the term \\"Third Reich\\" was a military exploitation of a non-military term proposed by Arthur Moeller van den Bruck, the phrase \\"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\\" was proposed by Kiyoshi Miki, a Kyoto School analytic philosopher who was actually opposed to militarism. An earlier, influential concept was the geographically smaller version of the co- prosperity sphere which was called , which was announced by Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe on 3 November 1938 and was limited to East Asia only.Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (2006), Asian security reassessed, pp. 48-49, 63, The original concept was an idealistic wish to liberate Asia from the rule of European colonial powers, however, some Japanese nationalists believed it could be used to gain resources which would be used to ensure that Japan would continue to be a modern power, and militarists believed that resource-rich Western colonies contained abundant supplies of raw materials which could be used to wage wars.John Toland, The Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire 1936-1945 p 447 Random House New York 1970 Many Japanese nationalists were drawn to it as an ideal.James L. McClain, Japan: A Modern History p 494 Many of them remained convinced, throughout the war, that the Sphere was idealistic, offering slogans in a newspaper competition, praising the sphere for constructive efforts and peace.John Toland, The Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire 1936-1945 p 449 Random House New York 1970 Konoe planned the Sphere in 1940 in an attempt to create a Great East Asia, comprising Japan, Manchukuo, China, and parts of Southeast Asia, that would, according to imperial propaganda, establish a new international order seeking \\"co-prosperity\\" for Asian countries which would share prosperity and peace, free from Western colonialism and domination of the White man.Iriye, Akira. (1999). Pearl Harbor and the coming of the Pacific War: a Brief History with Documents and Essays, p. 6. Military goals of this expansion included naval operations in the Indian Ocean and the isolation of Australia.Ugaki, Matome. (1991). Fading Victory: The Diary of Ugaki Matome, 1941‚Äì1945 This would enable the principle of hakk≈ç ichiu.James L. McClain, Japan: A Modern History p 470 This was just one of a number of slogans and concepts which were used to justify Japanese aggression in East Asia from the 1930s through the end of World War II. The term \\"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\\" is largely remembered by Western scholars, as a front for the Japanese control of occupied countries during World War II, in which puppet governments manipulated local populations and economies for the benefit of Imperial Japan. To combat the protectionist dollar and sterling zones, Japanese economic planners called for a \\"yen bloc\\".James L. McClain, Japan: A Modern History p 460 Japan's experiment with such financial imperialism encompassed both official and semi-official colonies.James L. McClain, Japan: A Modern History p 461-2 In the period between 1895 (when Japan annexed Taiwan) and 1937 (the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War), monetary specialists in Tokyo directed and managed programs of coordinated monetary reforms in Taiwan, Korea, Manchuria, and the peripheral Japanese-controlled islands in the Pacific. These reforms aimed to foster a network of linked political and economic relationships. These efforts foundered in the eventual debacle of the Greater East-Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.Vande Walle, Willy et al. The 'money doctors' from Japan: finance, imperialism, and the building of the Yen Bloc, 1894‚Äì1937 (abstract). FRIS/Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, 2007-2010. History The concept of a unified East Asia took form based on an Imperial Japanese Army concept which was developed by General Hachir≈ç Arita, an army ideologist who served as Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1936 to 1940. The Japanese Army said that the new Japanese empire was the Asian equivalent of the Monroe Doctrine,Anthony Rhodes, Propaganda: The art of persuasion: World War II, pp. 252‚Äì253, 1976, Chelsea House Publishers, New York especially with the Roosevelt Corollary. The regions of Asia, it was argued, were as essential to Japan as Latin America was to the United States.William L. O'Neill, A Democracy at War: America's Fight at Home and Abroad in World War II. Free Press, 1993, p. 53. The Japanese Foreign Minister Y≈çsuke Matsuoka formally announced the idea of the Co-Prosperity Sphere on 1 August 1940, in a press interview, but it had existed in other forms for many years. Leaders in Japan had long had an interest in the idea. The outbreak of World War II fighting in Europe had given the Japanese an opportunity to demand the withdrawal of support from China in the name of \\"Asia for Asiatics\\", with the European powers unable to effectively retaliate.William L. O'Neill, A Democracy at War, p. 62. Many of the other nations within the boundaries of the sphere were under colonial rule and elements of their population were sympathetic to Japan (as in the case of Indonesia), occupied by Japan in the early phases of the war and reformed under puppet governments, or already under Japan's control at the outset (as in the case of Manchukuo). These factors helped make the formation of the sphere, while lacking any real authority or joint power, come together without much difficulty. As part of its war drive, Japanese propaganda included phrases like \\"Asia for the Asiatics!\\" and talked about the perceived need to liberate Asian countries from imperialist powers.Anthony Rhodes, Propaganda: The art of persuasion: World War II, p. 248, 1976, Chelsea House Publishers, New York The failure to win the Second Sino-Japanese War 1937‚Äì1941 (‚Äì1945) was blamed on British and American exploitation of Southeast Asian colonies, even though the Chinese received far more assistance from the Soviet Union.James L. McClain, Japan: A Modern History p 471 In some cases local people welcomed Japanese troops when they invaded, driving out British, French, and other governments and military forces. In general, however, the subsequent pragmatism and brutality of the Japanese military, particularly in China, led the people of the occupied areas to regard the new Japanese imperialists as much worse than the Western imperialists. The Japanese government directed that local economies be managed strictly for the production of raw materials for the Japanese war effort; a cabinet member declared, \\"There are no restrictions. They are enemy possessions. We can take them, do anything we want.\\"James L. McClain, Japan: A Modern History p 495 An Investigation of Global Policy with the Yamato Race as Nucleus ‚Äì a secret document completed in 1943 for high-ranking government use ‚Äì laid out that Japan, as the originators and strongest military power within the region, would naturally take the superior position within the Greater East Asia Co- Prosperity Sphere, with the other nations under Japan's umbrella of protection. China and other Asian nations, on their own, were regarded as too weak and lacking in unity to be treated as fully equal partners, and this in any case would not have been in Japan's self-interest. The booklet Read This and the War is Won‚Äîfor the Japanese army‚Äîpresented colonialism as an oppressive group of colonists living in luxury by burdening Asians. Since racial ties of blood connected other Asians to the Japanese, and Asians had been weakened by colonialism, it was Japan's self-appointed role to \\"make men of them again\\" and liberate them from their Western oppressors.John W. Dower, War Without Mercy: Race & Power in the Pacific War pp. 24‚Äì25 From the Japanese point of view, one common principal reason stood behind both forming the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and initiating war with the Allies: Chinese markets. Japan wanted their \\"paramount relations\\" in regard to Chinese markets acknowledged by the U.S. government. The U.S., recognizing the abundance of potential wealth in these markets, refused to let the Japanese have an advantage in selling to China. In an attempt to give Japan a formal advantage over the Chinese markets, the Japanese Imperial regime first invaded China and later launched the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. According to Foreign Minister Shigenori T≈çg≈ç (in office 1941‚Äì1942 and 1945), should Japan be successful in creating this sphere, it would emerge as the leader of Eastern Asia, and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere would be synonymous with the Japanese Empire. =Greater East Asia Conference= Member states of the Greater East Asia Conference : Japan and colonies : Other territories occupied by Japan : Territories disputed and claimed by Japan The Greater East Asia Conference in November 1943, participants left to right: Ba Maw, Zhang Jinghui, Wang Jingwei, Hideki Tojo, Wan Waithayakon, Jos√© P. Laurel, and Subhas Chandra Bose The took place in Tokyo on 5‚Äì6 November 1943: Japan hosted the heads of state of various component members of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The conference was also referred to as the Tokyo Conference. The common language used by the delegates during the conference was English. The conference addressed few issues of substance but was intended by the Japanese to illustrate the Empire of Japan's commitments to the Pan-Asianism ideal and to emphasize its role as the \\"liberator\\" of Asia from western colonialism. The following dignitaries attended: *Hideki Tojo, Prime Minister of the Empire of Japan *Zhang Jinghui, Prime Minister of the Empire of Manchuria *Wang Jingwei, President of the Republic of China (Nanjing) *Ba Maw, Head of State of the State of Burma *Subhas Chandra Bose, Head of State of the Provisional Government of Free India *Jos√© P. Laurel, President of the Republic of the Philippines *Prince Wan Waithayakon, envoy from the Kingdom of Thailand Tojo greeted them with a speech praising the \\"spiritual essence\\" of Asia, as opposed to the \\"materialistic civilization\\" of the West. Their meeting was characterized by praise of solidarity and condemnation of Western colonialism but without practical plans for either economic development or integration.Andrew Gordon, A Modern History of Japan: From Tokugawa to the Present, p. 211, , The conference issued a Joint Declaration promoting economic and political cooperation against the Allied countries. =Members of the Sphere= Member countries and the year in which they joined the sphere: * (30 November 1940) * (30 November 1940) * Republic of China (Nanjing) (30 November 1940) * (21 December 1941) * State of Burma (1 August 1943) * (14 October 1943) * Provisional Government of Free India (21 October 1943) * Kingdom of Kampuchea (9 March 1945) * Empire of Vietnam (11 March 1945) * Kingdom of Luang Phrabang (8 April 1945) Imperial rule The ideology of the Japanese colonial empire, as it expanded dramatically during the war, contained two contradictory impulses. On the one hand, it preached the unity of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, a coalition of Asian races, directed by Japan, against the imperialism of the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, the United States, and European imperialism in general. This approach celebrated the spiritual values of the East in opposition to the crass materialism of the West.Jon Davidann, \\"Citadels of Civilization: U.S. and Japanese Visions of World Order in the Interwar Period\\", in Richard Jensen, et al. eds., Trans-Pacific Relations: America, Europe, and Asia in the Twentieth Century (2003) pp. 21‚Äì43 In practice, however, the Japanese installed organizationally-minded bureaucrats and engineers to run their new empire, and they believed in ideals of efficiency, modernization, and engineering solutions to social problems.Aaron Moore, Constructing East Asia: Technology, Ideology, and Empire in Japan's Wartime Era, 1931‚Äì1945 (2013) 226‚Äì227 Japan set up puppet regimes in Manchuria and China; they vanished at the end of the war. The Imperial Army operated ruthless governments in most of the conquered areas, but paid more favorable attention to the Dutch East Indies. The main goal was to obtain oil. The Dutch destroyed their oil wells but the Japanese reopened them. However most of the tankers taking oil to Japan were sunk by American submarines, so Japan's oil shortage became increasingly acute. Japan sponsored an Indonesian nationalist movement under Sukarno.Laszlo Sluimers, \\"The Japanese military and Indonesian independence\\", Journal of Southeast Asian Studies (1996) 27#1 pp. 19‚Äì36 Sukarno finally came to power in the late 1940s after several years of battling the Dutch.Bob Hering, Soekarno: Founding Father of Indonesia, 1901‚Äì1945 (2003) =Philippines= With a view of building up the economic base of the Co- Prosperity Sphere, the Japanese Army envisioned using the Philippine islands as a source of agricultural products needed by its industry. For example, Japan had a surplus of sugar from Taiwan, and a severe shortage of cotton, so they tried to grow cotton on sugar lands with disastrous results. They lacked the seeds, pesticides, and technical skills to grow cotton. Jobless farm workers flocked to the cities, where there was minimal relief and few jobs.

The plans were very difficult to implement in the face of limited skills, collapsed international markets, bad weather, and transportation shortages.

Dolan, ed. Philippines: A Country Study (1991) =Failure= The Co-Prosperity Sphere collapsed with Japan's surrender to the Allies in September 1945. Although Japan succeeded in stimulating anti-Westernism in most of Asia, the sphere never materialized into a unified Asia. Dr. Ba Maw, wartime President of Burma under the Japanese, blamed the Japanese military: In other words, the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere operated not for the betterment of all the Asian countries, but rather for Japan's own interests, and thus the Japanese failed to gather support in other Asian countries. Nationalist movements did appear in these Asian countries during this period and these nationalists did, to some extent, cooperate with the Japanese. However, Willard Elsbree, professor emeritus of political science at Ohio University, claims that the Japanese government and these nationalist leaders never developed \\"a real unity of interests between the two parties, [and] there was no overwhelming despair on the part of the Asians at Japan's defeat\\".Lebra, p. 160. The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere at its greatest extent The failure of Japan to understand the goals and interests of the other countries involved in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere led to a weak association of countries bound to Japan only in theory and not in spirit. Dr. Ba Maw argues that Japan could have engineered a very different outcome if the Japanese had only managed to act in accord with the declared aims of \\"Asia for the Asiatics\\". He argues that if Japan had proclaimed this maxim at the beginning of the war, and if the Japanese had actually acted on that idea, Propaganda efforts Pamphlets were dropped by airplane on the Philippines, Malaya, North Borneo, Sarawak, Singapore, and Indonesia, urging them to join this movement.Anthony Rhodes, Propaganda: The art of persuasion: World War II, p253 1976, Chelsea House Publishers, New York Mutual cultural societies were founded in all conquered nations to ingratiate with the natives and try to supplant English with Japanese as the commonly used language.Anthony Rhodes, Propaganda: The art of persuasion: World War II, p254 1976, Chelsea House Publishers, New York Multi-lingual pamphlets depicted many Asians marching or working together in happy unity, with the flags of all the nations and a map depicting the intended sphere.\\"Japanese Propaganda Booklet from World War II\\" Others proclaimed that they had given independent governments to the countries they occupied, a claim undermined by the lack of power given these puppet governments.\\"JAPANESE PSYOP DURING WWII\\" In Thailand, a street was built to demonstrate it, to be filled with modern buildings and shops, but of it consisted of false fronts.Edwin P. Hoyt, Japan's War, p 326 A network of Japanese-sponsored film production, distribution, and exhibition companies extended across the Japanese Empire and was collectively referred to as the Greater East Asian Film Sphere. These film centers mass-produced shorts, newsreels, and feature films to encourage Japanese language acquisition as well as cooperation with Japanese colonial authorities. Projected territorial extent yen stamp from 1942 depicting the approximate extension of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere Prior to the escalation of World War II to the Pacific and East Asia, the Japanese planners regarded it as self-evident that the conquests secured in Japan's earlier wars with Russia (South Sakhalin and Kwantung), Germany (South Seas Mandate) and China (Manchuria) would be retained, as well as Korea (Ch≈çsen), Taiwan (Formosa), the recently seized additional portions of China and occupied French Indochina.Weinberg, L. Gerhard. (2005). Visions of Victory: The Hopes of Eight World War II Leaders p.62-65. =The Land Disposal Plan= A reasonably accurate indication as to the geographic dimensions of the Co-Prosperity Sphere are elaborated on in a Japanese wartime document prepared in December 1941 by the Research Department of the Imperial Ministry of War. Known as the \\"Land Disposal Plan in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\\" () it was put together with the consent of and according to the directions of the Minister of War (later Prime Minister) Hideki T≈çj≈ç. It assumed that the already established puppet governments of Manchukuo, Mengjiang, and the Wang Jingwei regime in Japanese-occupied China would continue to function in these areas. Beyond these contemporary parts of Japan's sphere of influence it also envisaged the conquest of a vast range of territories covering virtually all of East Asia, the Pacific Ocean, and even sizable portions of the Western Hemisphere, including in locations as far removed from Japan as South America and the eastern Caribbean. Although the projected extension of the Co- Prosperity Sphere was extremely ambitious, the Japanese goal during the \\"Greater East Asia War\\" was not to acquire all the territory designated in the plan at once, but to prepare for a future decisive war some 20 years later by conquering the Asian colonies of the defeated European powers, as well as the Philippines from the United States. When T≈çj≈ç spoke on the plan to the House of Peers he was vague about the long-term prospects, but insinuated that the Philippines and Burma might be allowed independence, although vital territories such as Hong Kong would remain under Japanese rule.W. G. Beasley, The Rise of Modern Japan, p 204 The Micronesian islands that had been seized from Germany in World War I and which were assigned to Japan as C-Class Mandates, namely the Marianas, Carolines, Marshall Islands, and several others do not figure in this project. They were the subject of earlier negotiations with the Germans and were expected to be officially ceded to Japan in return for economic and monetary compensations. The plan divided Japan's future empire into two different groups. The first group of territories were expected to become either part of Japan or otherwise be under its direct administration. Second were those territories that would fall under the control of a number of tightly-controlled pro-Japanese vassal states based on the model of Manchukuo, as nominally \\"independent\\" members of the Greater East Asian alliance. German and Japanese direct spheres of influence at their greatest extents in fall 1942. Arrows show planned movements to the proposed demarcation line at 70¬∞ E, which was, however, never even approximated. Parts of the plan depended on successful negotiations with Nazi Germany and a global victory by the Axis powers. After Germany and Italy declared war on the United States on 11 December 1941, Japan presented the Germans with a drafted military convention that would specifically delimit the Asian continent by a dividing line along the 70th meridian east longitude. This line, running southwards through the Ob River's Arctic estuary, southwards to just east of Khost in Afghanistan and heading into the Indian Ocean just west of Rajkot in India, would have split Germany's Lebensraum and Italy's spazio vitale territories to the west of it, and Japan's Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and its other areas to the east of it. The plan of the Third Reich for fortifying its own Lebensraum territory's eastern limits, beyond which the Co- Prosperity Sphere's northwestern frontier areas would exist in East Asia, involved the creation of a \\"living wall\\" of Wehrbauer \\"soldier-peasant\\" communities defending it. However, it is unknown if the Axis powers ever formally negotiated a possible, complementary second demarcation line that would have divided the Western Hemisphere.

The possibility of re- establishing the defunct Kingdom of Hawaii was also considered, based on the model of Manchukuo.Levine (1995), p. 92 Those favoring annexation of Hawaii (on the model of Karafuto) intended to use the local Japanese community, which had constituted 43% (c. 160,000) of Hawaii's population in the 1920s, as a leverage. Hawaii was to become self-sufficient in food production, while the Big Five corporations of sugar and pineapple processing were to be broken up.Stephan, J. J.

Unity is evident in unions such as the United States of America and the European Union. During World War II, Japan also intended to create such unity for Asian countries. Japan wanted to enforce the Imperial Way on the people and resources of East Asia. The affected countries were those in the Pacific, Indian Ocean, and Central Asia regions. The nations included Japan, China, India, and Manchuria. Japan intended to 'delivering' these nations from the rule of America and Europe. These countries would be guided by peace and prosperity for all, unlike in the Western nations where individuals 'fight' each other for success. However, it is important to note that the establishment would be for the benefit of Japan more than other nations. The Imperial Way was a law by the Japanese system, and thus, little consideration was given for the laws of other governments. The Imperial government wanted to establish an Imperial Way across East Asia and abandon the spreading 'Western individualism and materialism.' This plan required driving out the British and American people out of the region. The drafters believed that the Westerns were responsible for the issues in the region. America and Europe usually follow an individualistic philosophy. Individualism believes in the promotion of individual interest. In Western nations, it is a common practice where people compete with each other for individual benefit. The Japanese government saw this practice as detrimental to the development of East Asia. This is because individualism creates a gap between the rich as the poor. Also, the competition for self-success comes at the cost of loss of welfare for others. For instance, the rich will oppress the poor so as to maintain their wealth level. The achievement of individualism is guided by materialism, that is, the greed for more wealth without regard to others. Materialism values physical possession than spiritual 'wealth.' It considers wealth as the core life objective. These beliefs contradicted the Imperial Way, which was concerned about spiritual well-being. It believes that wealth comes second to human interests, such as peace and love. Therefore, the Imperial Way differed from Western individualism and materialism by purporting to support unity and prosperity for all. The drafters believed that materialism was one of the causes of conflict, and more specifically, World War I and II. As each nation wants to increase its wealth, it reaches a limit where any additional increase will require taking up some of the property of the neighbor. The neighbor ‚Äì in the protection of their property ‚Äì responds violently. As a result, the neighbors go to war. The Japanese government believed that greed is what had pushed the Westerns into exploiting Asia‚Äôs wealth. The empire thus believed that the Imperial way could eliminate national conflict. People would not work to increase individual wealth but rather the community‚Äôs wealth. As a result, conflict can be avoided, and peace and prosperity for all would prevail. In conclusion, the Japanese government purported to be opposing individualism and materialism. However, through uniting the East Asian nation, the empire would be separating itself from other regions. The Japanese government wanted to maintain wealth in the regions and only use the resources for improving the lives of the Asiana. Therefore, while within the region, there would be no individualism, from a global perspective, Japan would have developed itself as self-reliant, thus creating individualism from other regions of the world. Furthermore, it would create wealth for its member nations. Thus, through unity, the empire would still be promoting individualism and materialism from a regional perspective.

Although his were not the first glass photographs,Gernsheim, Helmut. (1986). A Concise History of Photography, third revised edition. New York: Dover Publications. pp. 9, 16.Herschel, John. (1839). 9 May 1839 letter from John Herschel to Henry Fox Talbot describing specimens shown to him by Louis Daguerre. Accessed 4 September 2014.Several standard histories of photography widely available during the past sixty years have mentioned the photographs on glass made by John Herschel in September 1839 (e.g., Gernsheim 1986, p. 16), sometimes including an illustration. What is by some definitions the very first successful photograph (i.e., an image produced by the action of light but reasonably light-fast and durable in its final form), a contact-exposed copy of an engraving, was made on glass by the bitumen process of Nic√©phore Ni√©pce in 1822 (Gernsheim 1986, p. 9). The later physautotype process, co-invented by Ni√©pce and Louis Daguerre in the early 1830s, was also used to produce photographs on glass, possibly including one mentioned by John Herschel in a 9 May 1839 letter to Henry Fox Talbot in which he reports visiting Daguerre in Paris and being shown \\"... all his Pictures on Silver ... and also one on glass\\" (Herschel 1839). Like Pucher's process, these experimental pre-1840 glass processes were never commercialized. Pucher's process was unique. It was the only 19th-century photography technique that was not based on expensive silver halide chemistry but was still sensitive enough to use in a camera, with exposure times comparable to those of the daguerreotype and calotype. (Other non-silver processes, such as the cyanotype, were practical only for making prints or photograms in direct sunlight.) Modern testing of Pucher's photographs has confirmed their chemically unusual nature. However, his process was never commercialized, and attempts to recreate it based on published information have been unsuccessful.  Biography  Pucher was born on August 26, 1814 in Kranj in the Duchy of Carniola in the Austrian Empire (now Slovenia). As a schoolchild, Pucher was interested in art, languages, and the natural sciences, especially chemistry and physics. He wanted to study art, but obeyed his mother's wish and became a Catholic priest. However, he continued to experiment in photography, art, and music. When the French Academy of Sciences announced the invention of the daguerreotype on 19 August 1839, Pucher quickly mastered the process, but it was too expensive, so he developed his own way of making photographs. On April 19, 1842, he invented a photographic process on glass that he called the hyalotype, or \\"svetlopis\\" in Slovene. His photos are also called puharotypes, in his honor. The first report about his invention was published in the newspaper Carniolia in 1841. While living in Bled, Pucher met a French viscount, Louis de Dax, who wrote about him in the Parisian magazine La Lumi√®re. The church then moved Pucher to a small village, Cerklje, where his contacts abroad lessened. Ultimately, he became sick from the harmful substances used in his experiments and died at the age of 49.  Hyalotype process  Hyalotype with self-portrait by Johann Pucher According to Pucher's records of his photographic process, he coated a small glass plate with a layer of light-sensitive sulfur, exposed it to iodine vapors, and inserted the prepared plate into a camera. He then poured mercury into a metal container, placed the mercury at the bottom of the camera, and heated it from below. He exposed the prepared plate to light for 15 seconds, and mercury vapors coated the exposed places on the picture. Pucher strengthened the picture with bromine steam and fixed it by wrapping it with alcohol. Finally, he preserved the photo with varnish. The advantages of Pucher's procedure included a shorter exposure time (15 seconds, which allowed him to make portraits), a positive image, and the possibility of reproduction. Pucher was not the first to try to create photos on glass: A Frenchman, Abel Ni√©pce de Saint-Victor, reported his own invention to the French Academy of Sciences in 1847. It was not until January 1851 that the Austrian Academy of Sciences published a report on Pucher's method.

Some of them were set to music by prominent composers.  Awards and honors  In recognition of Pucher's contribution to the Slovene national identity and the development of photographic science, Slovenia declared 2014 to be Pucher's Year. The honorary patronage of the jubilee was approved by President Borut Pahor. A yearlong program of events in Slovenia and abroad was organized in cooperation with many municipalities and institutions to celebrate the 200th anniversary of his birth.http://www.ukom.gov.si/en/media_room/newsletter_slovenia_news/news/article/391/5279/46a1801d98cd53a0c6817c0d10c17592/?tx_ttnews%5Bnewsletter%5D=240 Several items and locations are named after Pucher: * Janez Pucher Award, given by the Photographic Federation of Slovenia (Slovene: Fotografska zveza Slovenije) for exceptional achievement in photography * Puharotype, Pucher‚Äôs photo procedure * Puharjeva ulica, a street in Ljubljana * Puharjeva ulica, a street in Kranj * Pucher Prize, given by the Janez Puhar Photo Society in Kranj (Slovene: Fotografsko dru≈°tvo Janez Puhar Kranj) * Pucher Medal, given by the Janez Puhar Photo Society in Kranj for the best portrait at International Federation of Photographic Art (FIAP) exhibitions  Notes   References  External links Puhar.si A site dedicated to Pucher. 1814 births 1864 deaths People from Kranj Carniolan Roman Catholic priests Carniolan photographers 19th-century Austrian photographers Carniolan painters Carniolan Catholic poets Carniolan inventors 19th- century poets 19th-century painters 19th-century Carniolan writers 19th-century Roman Catholic priests ","title":"Johann Pucher"},{"id":"244158","text":"Happy Birthday, Cookie Monster book cover Happy Birthday, Cookie Monster () is a children's book by Felice Haus, with illustrations by Carol Nicklaus published 1986 by Random House.

The historic Lanai Theatre is a cultural landmark on Lanai, dating back to the 1930s.  Music institutions and industry  Hawaii is home to a number of renowned music institutions in several fields. The Honolulu Symphony Orchestra is an important part of the state's musical history, and is the oldest orchestra in the United States west of the Rocky Mountains, founded in 1900. The Orchestra has collaborated with other local institutions, like the Hawaii Opera Theatre and the O ªahu Choral Society, which sponsors the Honolulu Symphony Chorus and the Honolulu Chamber Choir. Numerous businesses have been created supporting the special musical styles and instruments suited to the Hawaiian musical tradition. The Guitar and Lute Workshop was an early manufacturer and proponent of specialty slack- key guitars in the early 1970s, and the Kamaka Ukulele company was established as key manufacturer of ukuleles for Hawaiian musical acts.  Folk music  Dancer with  ªuli ªuli, hula kahiko competition, Merrie Monarch Festival 2003 Hawaiian folk music includes several varieties of chanting (mele) and music meant for highly ritualized dance (hula). Traditional Hawaiian music and dance was functional, used to express praise, communicate genealogy and mythology, and accompany games, festivals and other secular events. The Hawaiian language has no word that translates precisely as music, but a diverse vocabulary exists to describe rhythms, instruments, styles and elements of voice production. Hawaiian folk music is simple in melody and rhythm, but is \\"complex and rich\\" in the \\"poetry, accompanying mimetic dance (hula), and subtleties of vocal styles... even in the attenuated forms in which they survive today\\". Hula performance at a ceremony depicting the turning over U.S. Navy control over the island of Kahoolawe to the state performed by Uncle Frank Kawaikapuokalani Hewett The chant (mele) is typically accompanied by an ipu heke (a double gourd) and/or pahu (sharkskin covered drum). Some dances require dancers to utilize hula implements such as an ipu (single gourd), iliili (waterworn lava stone castanets),uliuli (feathered gourd rattles), pu\`li (split bamboo sticks) or kalaau (rhythm sticks). The older, formal kind of hula is called kahiko, while the modern version is auana. There are also religious chants called oli; when accompanied by dancing and drums, it is called mele hula pahu. In the pre-contact Hawaiian language, the word mele referred to any kind of poetic expression, though it now translates as song. The two kinds of Hawaiian chanting were mele oli and mele hula. The first were a cappella individual songs, while the latter were accompanied dance music performed by a group. The chanters were known as haku mele and were highly trained composers and performers. Some kinds of chants express emotions like angst and affection, or request a favor from another person. Other chants are for specific purposes like naming, (mele inoa), prayer (mele pule), surfing (mele he'e nalu) and genealogical recitations (mele koihonua). Mele chants were governed by strict rules, and were performed in a number of styles include the rapid kepakepa and the enunciate koihonua.  Music history  Historical documentation of Hawaiian music does not extend prior to the late 18th century, when non-Hawaiians (haoles) arrived on the island. From 1778 onward, Hawaii began a period of acculturation with the introduction of numerous styles of European music, including the hymns (himeni) introduced by Protestant missionary choirs. Spanish-speaking Mexican cowboys (paniolos), were particularly influential immigrants in the field of music, introducing string instruments such as the guitar and possibly also the technique of falsetto singing, while Portuguese immigrants brought the ukulele-like braguinha. also immigrants from all over the world had brought their own instruments along with them to the islands. Elizabeth Tatar divided Hawaiian music history into seven periods, beginning with the initial arrival of Europeans and their musical cultures, spanning approximately from 1820 to 1872. The subsequent period lasted to the beginning of the 20th century, and was marked by the creation of an acculturated yet characteristically Hawaiian modern style, while European instruments spread across the islands. Tatar's third period, from 1900 to about 1915, saw the integration of Hawaiian music into the broader field of American popular music, with the invention of hapa haole songs, which use the English language and only superficial elements of Hawaiian music; the beginning of the Hawaiian recording industry was in 1906, when the Victor Talking Machine Company made the first 53 recordings in the territory.\\"Footsteps in the Dark: The Hidden Histories of Popular Music\\"; By George Lipsitz; page 228; Publisher: University of Minnesota Press; ; By 1912, recorded Hawaiian music had found an audience on the American mainland.Tatar, Elizabeth, in George Kanahele's Hawaiian Music and Musicians Puerto Rican immigration to Hawaii began when Puerto Rico's sugar industry was devastated by two hurricanes in 1899. The devastation caused a worldwide shortage in sugar and a huge demand for the product from Hawaii. Hawaiian sugarcane plantation owners began to recruit the jobless, but experienced, laborers in Puerto Rico. They took with them their music and in the early 1900s introduced what is known as Cachi Cachi music, on the islands of Hawaii. From 1915 to 1930, mainstream audiences outside of Hawaii became increasingly enamored of Hawaiian music, though by this time the songs marketed as Hawaiian had only peripheral aspects of actual Hawaiian music. Tahitian and Samoan music had an influence on Hawaiian music during this period, especially in their swifter and more intricate rhythms. The following era, from about 1930 to 1960, has been called the \\"Golden Age of Hawaiian music\\", when popular styles were adapted for orchestras and big bands, and Hawaiian performers like Lani McIntire, John Kameaaloha Almeida and Sol Ho ªopi ªi became mainstream stars. In the 1960s, Hawaiian-style music declined in popularity amid an influx of rock, soul and pop acts from the American mainland. This trend reversed itself in the final period of Hawaiian music history, the modern period beginning with the Hawaiian Renaissance in the 1970s and continuing with the foundation of a variety of modern music scenes in fields like indie rock, Hawaiian hip hop and Jawaiian. = Lili ªuokalani and Henri Berger = Lili'uokalani Queen Lili ªuokalani was the last Queen of Hawaii before the Hawaiian monarchy was overthrown. She was also a musician and prolific composer who wrote many musical works. She was best known for Aloha 'Oe. A compilation of her works, titled \\"The Queen's Songbook\\", was published in 1999 by The Queen Lili'uokalani Trust. Aloha'oe performed by Madam Alapai in 1911. Lili'uokalani was one of many members of the Hawaiian royal family with musical inclinations. They studied under a Prussian military bandleader, Henri Berger, who was sent by the Kaiser at the request of Kamehameha V. Berger became fascinated by Hawaiian folk music, and wrote much documentation on it. However, he also brought his own musical background in German music, and heavily guided the Hawaiian musicians and composers he worked with. King Kamehameha V also, in 1847, sent to Germany for a \\"band Leader\\" for \\"The Kings Own Band\\", now the Royal Hawaiian Band, William Mersberg, from Weimar, Germany. He is Henry Kaleialoha Allen's great grandfather. Henry Kaleialoha Allen is \\"one of Hawaii's Living Treasures of Hawaiian Music\\" and a master music educator and has been honored many times on the Senate Floor and by the Legislature for such. = Guitar innovations = Guitars could have come to Hawaii from several sources: sailors, missionaries, or travelers to and from California. The most frequently told story is that it accompanied the Mexican cowboys (vaqueros) brought by King Kamehameha III in 1832 in order to teach the natives how to control an overpopulation of cattle. The Hawaiian cowboys (paniolo) used guitars in their traditional folk music. The Portuguese introduced an instrument called the braguinha, a small, four-stringed Madeira variant of the cavaquinho; this instrument was a precursor to the \`ukulele. Steel-string guitars also arrived with the Portuguese in the 1860s and slack- key had spread across the chain by the late 1880s. A ship called the Ravenscrag arrived in Honolulu on August 23, 1879, bringing Portuguese field workers from Madeira. Legend has it that one of the men, Jo√£o Fernandes, later a popular musician, tried to impress the Hawaiians by playing folk music with a friend's braguinha; it is also said that the Hawaiians called the instrument \`ukulele (jumping flea) in reference to the man's swift fingers. Others have claimed the word means gift that came here or a corruption of ukeke lele (dancing ukeke, a three-string bow). The popularity throughout the 1920s of Hawaiian music, with its unique slide-style of guitar playing, prompted the invention of the electric guitar in 1931, as a lap steel guitar, the \\"frying pan\\", by George Beauchamp. Electric amplification allowed the Hawaiian-style guitar to be heard in performances of larger popular bands. = Late 19th and early 20th century = 1913 sheet music cover In the 1880s and 90s, King David Kalakaua promoted Hawaiian culture and also encouraged the addition of new instruments, such as the ukulele and possibly steel guitar; Kalakaua died in 1891, and so it is highly unlikely he would have heard it.See: Kanahele, George S., Hawaiian Music and Musicians, pp 367‚Äì368 Kalakaua's successor, his sister Lili'uokalani, was also a prolific composer and wrote several songs, like \\"Aloha 'Oe\\", which remain popular. During this period, Hawaiian music evolved into a \\"new distinctive\\" style, using the derivatives of European instruments; aside from the widespread string instruments, brass bands like the Royal Hawaiian Band performed Hawaiian songs as well as popular marches and ragtimes. In about 1889, Joseph Kekuku began sliding a piece of steel across the strings of a guitar, thus inventing steel guitar (kika kila); at about the same time, traditional Hawaiian music with English lyrics became popular. Vocals predominated in Hawaiian music until the 20th century, when instrumentation took a lead role. Much of modern slack-key guitar has become entirely instrumental. From about 1895 to 1915, Hawaiian music dance bands became in demand more and more. These were typically string quintets. Ragtime music influenced the music, and English words were commonly used in the lyrics. This type of Hawaiian music, influenced by popular music and with lyrics being a combination of English and Hawaiian (or wholly English), is called hapa haole (literally: half white) music. In 1903, Albert \\"Sonny\\" Cunha composed My Waikiki Mermaid, arguably the first popular hapa haole song (The earliest known hapa haole song, \\"Eating of the Poi\\", was published in Ka Buke o na Leo Mele Hawaii...o na Home Hawaii in Honolulu in 1888 [See Kanahele, George S., Hawaiian Music and Musicians pp 71‚Äì72]). In 1927, Rose Moe (1908‚Äì1999), a Hawaiian singer, with her husband Tau Moe (1908‚Äì2004), a Samoan guitarist, began touring with Madame Riviere's Hawaiians. In 1929 they recorded eight songs in Tokyo. Rose and Tau continued touring for over fifty years, living in countries such as Germany, Lebanon and India. They even performed in Germany as late as 1938 when the Nazi racism was on the rise and people of a darker color were regarded as inferior people; it is said that they even performed for Adolf Hitler himself. With their children, the Tau Moe family did much to spread the sound of Hawaiian folk music and hapa haole music throughout the world. In 1988, the Tau Moe family re-recorded the 1929 sessions with the help of musician and ethnomusicologist Bob Brozman. The 1920s also saw the development of a uniquely Hawaiian style of jazz, innovated by performers at the Moana and Royal Hawaiian Hotels. Slack key guitar Slack-key guitar (kƒ´ ho\`alu in Hawaiian) is a fingerpicked playing style, named for the fact that the strings are most often \\"slacked\\" or loosened to create an open (unfingered) chord, either a major chord (the most common is G, which is called \\"taro patch\\" tuning) or a major 7th (called a \\"wahine\\" tuning). A tuning might be invented to play a particular song or facilitate a particular effect, and as late as the 1960s they were often treated as family secrets and passed from generation to generation. By the time of the Hawaiian Renaissance, though, the example of players such as Auntie Alice Namakelua, Leonard Kwan, Raymond Kane, and Keola Beamer had encouraged the sharing of the tunings and techniques and probably saved the style from extinction. Playing techniques include \\"hammering-on\\", \\"pulling-off\\", \\"chimes\\" (harmonics), and \\"slides,\\" and these effects frequently mimic the falsettos and vocal breaks common in Hawaiian singing. The guitar entered Hawaiian culture from a number of directions--sailors, settlers, contract workers. One important source of the style was Mexican cowboys hired to work on the Big Island of Hawaii in the first half of the 19th century. These paniolo brought their guitars and their music, and when they left, the Hawaiians developed their own style of playing the instrument. Slack key guitar evolved to accompany the rhythms of Hawaiian dancing and the melodies of Hawaiian chant. Hawaiian music in general, which was promoted under the reign of King David Kalakaua as a matter of national pride and cultural revival, drew rhythms from traditional Hawaiian beats and European military marches, and drew its melodies from Christian hymns and the cosmopolitan peoples of the islands (although principally American).  Popularization  An advertisement for the Broadway show \\"The Bird of Paradise\\" In the early 20th century Hawaiians began touring the United States, often in small bands. A Broadway show called Bird of Paradise introduced Hawaiian music to many Americans in 1912 and the Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition in San Francisco followed in 1915; one year later, Hawaiian music sold more recordings than any other style in the country. The increasing popularization of Hawaiian music influenced blues and country musicians; this connection can still be heard in modern country. In reverse, musicians like Bennie Nawahi began incorporating jazz into his steel guitar, ukulele and mandolin music, while the Kalama Quartet introduced a style of group falsetto singing. The musician Sol Ho ªopi ªi arose during this time, playing both Hawaiian music and jazz, Western swing and country, and developing the pedal steel guitar; his recordings helped establish the Nashville sound of popular country music. Lani McIntire was another musician who infused a Hawaiian guitar sound into mainstream American popular music through his recordings with Jimmie Rodgers and Bing Crosby. A 1916 advertisement for Hawaiian music records from Victor Records. In the 1920s and 30s, Hawaiian music became an integral part of local tourism, with most hotels and attractions incorporating music in one form or another. Among the earliest and most popular musical attractions was the Kodak Hula Show, sponsored by Kodak, in which a tourist purchased Kodak film and took photographs of dancers and musicians. The show ran from 1937 through 2002. Several vinyl LPs featuring music from the Kodak Hula Show were released by Waikiki Records, with full color photographs of the show's performers. In the first half of the 20th century, the mostly young men who hung around the Honolulu beaches, swimming and surfing, came to be known as the Waikiki Beachboys and their parties became famous across Hawaii and abroad; most of them played the ukulele all day long, sitting on the beach and eventually began working for hotels to entertain tourists. Popular Hawaiian music with English verse (hapa haole) can be described in a narrow sense. Generally, songs are sung to the ukulele or steel guitar. A steel string guitar sometimes accompanies. Melodies often feature an intervallic leap, such as a perfect fourth or octave. Falsetto vocals are suited for such leaps and are common in Hawaiian singing, as is the use of microtones. Rhythm is mostly in duple meter. A musical scale that is unique to Hawaiian music imbues it with its distinct feel, and so is aptly named the Hawaiian scale. The Panama- Pacific Exposition in San Francisco in 1915 introduced Hawaiian steel guitar to mainland country music artists, and by the 1930s country stars Hoot Gibson and Jimmy Davis were making records with Hawaiian musicians. The influx of thousands of American servicemen into Hawaii during World War II created a demand for both popular swing rhythm and country sounds. The western swing style, popular on the mainland since the 1930s, employed the steel guitar as a key element and was therefore a natural evolution. Beginning in 1945, the Bell Record Company of Honolulu responded to the demand with a series of releases by the western swing band Fiddling Sam and his Hawaiian Buckaroos (led by fiddler Homer H. Spivey, and including Lloyd C. Moore, Tiny Barton, Al Hittle, Calvert Duke, Tolbert E. Stinnett and Raymond \\"Blackie\\" Barnes). Between 1945‚Äì1950 Bell released some 40 sides by the Hawaiian Buckaroos, including a set of square dance numbers.  Modern music  In recent decades, traditional Hawaiian music has undergone a renaissance, with renewed interest from both ethnic Hawaiians and others. The islands have also produced a number of well- regarded rock, pop, hip hop, Dubstep, soul and reggae performers, and many local musicians in the clubs of Waikiki and Honolulu play outside the various \\"Hawaiian\\" genres. Hawaii has its own regional music industry, with several distinctive styles of recorded popular music. Hawaiian popular music is largely based on American popular music, but does have distinctive retentions from traditional Hawaiian music. = Hawaiian Renaissance = The Hawaiian Renaissance was a resurgence in interest in Hawaiian music, especially slack- key, among ethnic Hawaiians. Long-standing performers like Gabby Pahinui found their careers revitalized; Pahinui, who had begun recording in 1947, finally reached mainstream audiences across the United States when sessions on which Ry Cooder played with him and his family were released as The Gabby Pahinui Hawaiian Band, Vol. 1 on a major mainland label. Pahinui inspired a legion of followers who played a mix of slack-key, reggae, country, rock and other styles. The more traditional players included Leland \\"Atta\\" Isaacs, Sr., Sonny Chillingworth, Ray Kane, Leonard Kwan, Ledward Ka\`apana, Dennis Pavao, while Keola Beamer and Peter Moon have been more eclectic in their approach. The Emerson brothers rekindled the classic sound of Sol Ho'opi'i with the National steel guitar on their vintage 1920s stylings. George Kanahele's Hawaiian Music Foundation did much to spread slack-key and other forms of Hawaiian music, especially after a major 1972 concert. Don Ho (1930‚Äì2007), originally from the small Honolulu neighborhood of Kaka'ako, was the most widely known Hawaiian entertainer of the last decades of the 20th century. Although he did not play \\"traditional\\" Hawaiian music, Ho became an unofficial ambassador of Hawaiian culture throughout the world as well as on the American mainland. Ho's style often combined traditional Hawaiian elements and older 1950s and 1960s-style crooner music with an easy listening touch. Loyal Garner also embraced Hawaiian elements in her Vegas-style lounge act and in the songs she recorded. A third notable performer, Myra English, became known as the \\"Champagne Lady\\" after recording the song \\"Drinking Champagne\\" by Bill Mack in 1963 became her signature song in Hawaii, and she achieved considerable commercial success both locally and abroad. = Jawaiian = Jawaiian is a Hawaiian style of reggae music. Reggae music is a genre that evolved in the late 1960s and earlier in Jamaica. It has become popular across the world, especially among ethnic groups and races that have been historically oppressed, such as Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, and Australian Aborigines. In Hawaii, ethnic Hawaiians and others in the state began playing a mixture of reggae and local music in the early 1980s, although it was not until the late 1980s that it became recognized as a new genre in local music. The band Simplisity has been credited by Quiet Storm Records as originators of the Jawaiian style. By the end of the 1980s, Jawaiian came to dominate the local music scene, as well as spawning a backlash that the Honolulu Star-Bulletin compared to the \\"disco sucks\\" movement of the late 1970s. Reggae culture as a whole began to dominate Hawaii, as many locals can be seen sporting Bob Marley memorabilia, and much local merchandise and souvenirs have been emblazoned with the red, yellow, and green colors of the Hawaiian sovereignty as well as the Lion of Judah flag, a known symbol of the Rastafari movement. The Rasta colors have also become a symbol of local pride. = Rock and roll = Rock and roll music has long been popular in Hawaii - numerous rock and roll artists spent their developmental years in Hawaii (i.e. members of The Association, The Electric Prunes, 7th Order, Vicious Rumors, as well as guitarists Marty Friedman and Charlie \\"Icarus\\" Johnson), and its local popularity dates back to the earliest days of rock music. Elvis Presley's career included several Hawaii-related performances and records: a March 1961 live performance to raise money for the construction of the USS Arizona Memorial at the Pearl Harbor Bloch Arena in March 1961, his Aloha from Hawaii Via Satellite \\"comeback\\" record and concert in 1973, and three of his movies were based in Hawaii (Blue Hawaii, Girls! Girls! Girls!, and Paradise, Hawaiian Style). Through the 1960s and 1970s, rock concerts were frequently held at venues like the Honolulu International Center and The Waikiki Shell by artists like Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, The Doors, Eric Clapton, Deep Purple, Jeff Beck and many other top rock artists. The 3-day long Crater Festivals (held over the New Years and July 4 holidays) at Diamond Head in the 1960s and 1970s were well attended through the era, and frequently featured popular bands like Fleetwood Mac, Journey and Santana (Carlos Santana and Buddy Miles actually released their 1972 Crater Festival performance on the LP Carlos Santana & Buddy Miles! Live!). = Jazz = Musicians Some notable current and retired jazz musicians in Hawaii include Gabe Baltazar (saxophone), Martin Denny (piano), Arthur Lyman (vibraphone and marimba), Henry Allen (guitar), vonBaron (drums), David Choy (saxophone), Rich Crandall (piano), Dan Del Negro (keyboards), Pierre Grill (piano/keyboards/trombone), Bruce Hamada (bass), DeShannon Higa (trumpet), Jim Howard (piano), Steve Jones (bass), John Kolivas (bass), Noel Okimoto (drums/percussion/vibes), Michael Paulo (reeds), Rene Paulo (acoustic grand piano) was a forerunner of recording Hawaiian music in the jazz venue in the early 1960s and is one of Hawaii's legendary music greats, Robert Shinoda (guitar), Arex Ikehara (bass), Phil Bennett (drums), Aron Nelson (piano), Tennyson Stephens (piano), Dean Taba (bass), Betty Loo Taylor (piano), Tim Tsukiyama (saxophone), Reggie Padilla (saxophone) and Abe Lagrimas Jr. (drums/ukulele/vibes). Notable jazz vocalists in Hawaii, both current and retired include Jimmy Borges, Rachel Gonzales, Azure McCall, Dana Land, Joy Woode and I. Mihana Souza. Although Hawaiian vocalist Melveen Leed is known primarily for singing Hawaiian and \\"Hawaiian country\\" music, she has also earned good reviews as a jazz singer. There are frequent performances by the University of Hawaii jazz bands. = Ukulele = The ukulele was introduced to Hawaii by Madeiran immigrants near the close of the 19th century. The Portuguese brought a small guitar-like instrument, known as the machete. The instrument became a very popular one in Hawaiian culture, and a majority of Hawaiian songs involve the ukulele. In Hawaiian, ukulele literally means \\"flea (uku) jumping (lele).\\" It was named as such because when plucked, the high pitch of the strings brings to mind the image of a jumping flea. There are currently four sizes of ukulele; soprano, concert, tenor and baritone. Queen Liliuokalani, the last Hawaiian Queen, believed that the name for the ukulele means \\"The gift that came here\\". She believed this because of the Hawaiian words \\"uku\\" which means \\"gift or reward\\" and \\"lele\\" which means \\"to come.\\"Pryor, Alton. Little Known Tales in Hawaii History. Stagecoach Publishing: 2004 The ukulele can be played with simple or elaborate strums, as well as fingerpicking. Koa wood is one of the higher quality woods which creates a deep and also clear sound for the ukulele. This makes Koa ukuleles very distinguishable by sound. Because of this, koa wood is known as a revered wood to create an ukulele. Not only are koa ukuleles distinguishable by sound, but also by looks. They have a very unique grain pattern and color that allows them to stand out more than the average wood. = ‚Äò≈™kƒìkƒì = The Ukeke is a Hawaiian musical bow played with the mouth. It is the only stringed instrument indigenous to Hawaii. ='Ohe hano ihu= The 'ohe hano ihu, (Hawaiian: \`ohe = bamboo +hano = breath + ihu = nose) or Traditional Hawaiian Nose Flute in English, is another type of Hawaiian instrument that has cultural and musical importance. It is made from a single bamboo section. According to Arts and Crafts of Hawai\`i by Te Rangi Hiroa, old flutes in the Bishop Museum collection have a hole at the node area for the breath, and two or three fingering holes. In the three-finger-hole specimen, one fingering hole is placed near the breath hole. Lengths range from 10‚Äì21 inches (250‚Äì530 mm). Oral tradition in various families states that numbers of fingering holes ranged from one to four, and location of the holes varied depending on the musical taste of the player. Though primarily a courting instrument played privately and for personal enjoyment, it also could be used in conjunction with chants, song, and hula. Kumu hula (dance masters), were said to be able to either make the flute sound as though it were chanting, or to chant as they played. Kumu hula Leilehua Yuen is one of the few contemporary Hawaiian musicians to perform with the nose flute in this manner. Into the 19th and early 20th centuries, young men still used the 'ohe hano ihu as a way to win the affection and love of a woman. Today, the \`ohe hano ihu is enjoying a resurgence of popularity. Two different oral traditions explain the use of the nose for playing the \`ohe hano ihu. According to one, the \`ohe hano ihu is played with air from the nose rather than from the mouth because a person's hƒÅ, breath, is expressive of the person's inner being. As the hƒÅ travels from the na\`ao, or gut, through the mouth, the hƒÅ can be used to lie. When the hƒÅ travels through the nose, it cannot lie. Therefore, if a young man loves a woman, that love will be expressed in the music he plays with his \`ohe hano ihu. According to the other tradition, the instrument is played with the nose to enable the player to softly sing or chant while playing. Modern folklore says that the Hawaiian flute expresses \\"aloha\\" because to hear the flute one must come close to the alo, \\"face\\" or \\"presence\\" of the player to hear the hƒÅ, \\"divine breath\\" and so the listener experiences \\"being in one another's presence sharing the divine breath.\\" While useful as a way to remember the contemplative and personal nature of the traditional Hawaiian flute, there is no actual etymological evidence, nor is there evidence in traditional chants or stories, to support this etymology. In the Hawaiian language, hƒÅ, breath, is unrelated to the word ha, a causative prefix. a search of cognate words in related languages also reveals no such etymologies for the word \\"aloha\\". According to the book \`Ohe, by Leilehua Yuen, the instrument was popularized in the 1970s by members of the Beamer family who played it during performances on tour in North America, as well as in the Hawaiian Islands. Segments of the children's educational TV show, Sesame Street, showing Keola Beamer and Mr. Snuffalupagus, one of the large puppet characters, playing \`ohe hano ihu brought the instrument to national attention. Winona Beamer, Keola Beamer's mother, a noted kumu hula, also taught the use of the \`ohe hano ihu in hula. Her hƒÅnai daughter, Maile Beamer Loo, continues to preserve and teach that legacy, and document such important aspects of Hawaiian musical and performing heritage through the Hula Preservation Society. Notable late 20th Century and early 21st Century musicians of the\`ohe hano ihu include Mahi Beamer, Nona Beamer, Keola Beamer, Kapono Beamer, Calvin Hoe, Nelson Kaai, Anthony Natividad, and Manu Josiah. = Other = The music that is considered popular or \\"underground\\" in Hawaii does not necessarily correspond to similar genres in mainland areas of the U.S.A. This is partly a result of Hawaiian music, which appeals to many generations; in contrast, music like heavy metal or punk rock appeals primarily to a more youthful generation, and is not considered as commercially attractive to tourism. Na mele paleoleo is an emerging form of Hawaiian rap. It is difficult to promote popular acts from the mainland due to its geographical isolation, and the smaller group of people interested in the music. Bruno Mars from Honolulu has 6 #1 Billboard Hot 100 hits, including \\"Uptown Funk\\" in 2015. Yvonne Elliman, from Honolulu, had a #1 Hot 100 hit with the disco song \\"If I Can't Have You\\" from Saturday Night Fever in 1978. Bette Midler, also from Honolulu, had a #1 Hot 100 hit with \\"Wind Beneath My Wings\\" in 1989. Glenn Medeiros had a #1 Hot 100 hit in 1990 with \\"She Ain't Worth It\\" ft. Bobby Brown. Tane Cain, who was raised in Hawaii, had a #37 Hot 100 hit with \\"Holdin' On\\" in 1982. =McDonald's NextNext Music: Sounds That Spark Change= In 2016, McDonald's of Hawaii launched the NextNext Music: Sounds That Spark Change competition and charity event that featured 40 Hawaii musicians, bands and artists. McDonald's consumers voted with NextNext vote cards through the McDonald's NextNext app with music downloads. The ten finalists were Emi Hart, Tahiti Rey, Jason Tom, Brooks Maguire, The Fresh Preps, Hook and Line band, Dennis and Christy Soares, Jonny Eureka, The Hollow Spheres, Mikey Fiyah. The musicians, bands and artists generated support for Ronald McDonald House Charities, Hawaii Island Humane Society, AccesSurf, People Attentive To Children, National Multiple Sclerosis Society, Hawaiian Music Hall of Fame, and Project Vision.

Over time, the concept or idea is reinforced to become a strong belief in many people's minds, and may be regarded by the members of the community as fact. Often, the concept or idea may be further reinforced by publications in the mass media, books, or other means of communication. The phrase \\"millions of people can't all be wrong\\" is indicative of the common tendency to accept a communally reinforced idea without question, which often aids in the widespread acceptance of factoids. A very similar term to this term is community-reinforcement, which is a behavioral method to stop drug addiction. In addiction treatment The community-reinforcement approach (CRA) is a behaviourist alcoholism treatment approach that aims to achieve abstinence by eliminating positive reinforcement for drinking and enhancing positive reinforcement for sobriety. CRA integrates several treatment components, including building the client's motivation to quit drinking, helping the client initiate sobriety, analyzing the client's drinking pattern, increasing positive reinforcement, learning new coping behaviors, and involving significant others in the recovery process. These components can be adjusted to the individual client's needs to achieve optimal treatment outcome. In addition, treatment outcome can be influenced by factors such as therapist style and initial treatment intensity. Several studies have provided evidence for CRA's effectiveness in achieving abstinence. Furthermore, CRA has been successfully integrated with a variety of other treatment approaches, such as family therapy and motivational interviewing, and has been tested in the treatment of other drug abuse. Community reinforcement and family training (CRAFT) is an adaptation of CRA that is aimed at giving the Concerned Significant Others (CSOs) of alcoholics skills to help them get the alcoholic into treatment. In other applications In Chris E. Stout's book The Psychology of Terrorism: Theoretical Understandings and Perspective, Stout explains how community reinforcement is present in the psychotic state of terrorists. \\"The individual would feel less charged, validated, courageous, sanctified, and zealous, and would feel exposed as an individual.\\" It is believed that the group mentality of a terrorist organization solidifies the mission of the group through communal reinforcement. Members are more likely to stay dedicated and follow through with the event of terror if they receive support from fellow terrorist members. An individual might abandon the mission in terror, but with the reinforcement of his peers, a member is more likely to stay involved.

The initial nations targeted were Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States with the embargo also later extended to Portugal, Rhodesia and South Africa. By the end of the embargo in March 1974, the price of oil had risen nearly 300%, from US$3 per barrel to nearly $12 globally; US prices were significantly higher. The embargo caused an oil crisis, or \\"shock\\", with many short- and long-term effects on global politics and the global economy. It was later called the \\"first oil shock\\", followed by the 1979 oil crisis, termed the \\"second oil shock\\". Background =American production decline= By 1969, American domestic output of oil could not keep pace with increasing demand. In 1925, oil had accounted for one-fifth of American energy use; by the time World War II started, one-third of America's energy needs was met by oil. Oil started to replace coal as a preferred fuel source. It was used to heat homes and generate electricity, and it was the only fuel that could be used for air transport. In 1920, American oilfields accounted for nearly two-thirds of global oil production. In 1945, US production had increased to just over two- thirds. The US had been able to meet its own energy needs independently in the decade between 1945 and 1955, but was importing 350 million barrels per year by the late 1950s, mostly from Venezuela and Canada. In 1973, US production had declined to 16.5% of global output. The costs of producing oil in the Middle East were low enough that companies could turn a profit despite the US tariff on oil imports. This hurt domestic oil producers in places like Texas and Oklahoma who had been selling oil at tariff-supported prices and now had to compete with cheap oil from the Persian Gulf region. The first American firms to take advantage of low production costs in the Middle East were Getty, Standard Oil of Indiana, Continental Oil and Atlantic Richfield. In 1959, President Dwight D. Eisenhower said \\"As long as Middle Eastern oil continues to be as cheap as it is, there is probably little we can do to reduce the dependence of Western Europe on the Middle East.\\" Eventually, at the behest of independent American producers, Eisenhower imposed quotas on foreign oil that would stay in place between 1959 and 1973. Critics called it the \\"drain America first\\" policy. Some scholars believe the policy contributed to the decline of domestic US oil production in the early 1970s. While US oil production declined, domestic demand was increasing at the same time, leading to inflation and a steadily rising consumer price index between 1964 and 1970. US surplus production capacity had declined from 4 million bpd to around 1 million bpd between 1963 and 1970, increasing American dependence on foreign oil imports. When Richard Nixon took office in 1969, he assigned George Shultz to head a committee to review the Eisenhower-era quota program. Shultz's committee recommended that the quotas be abolished and replaced with tariffs but Nixon decided to keep the quotas due to vigorous political opposition. Nixon imposed a price ceiling on oil in 1971 as demand for oil was increasing and production was declining, which increased dependence on foreign oil imports as consumption was bolstered by low prices. In 1973, Nixon announced the end of the quota system. Between 1970 and 1973 US imports of crude oil had nearly doubled, reaching 6.2 million barrels per day in 1973. Until 1973, an abundance of oil supply had kept the market price of oil lower than the posted price. =OPEC= The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was founded by five oil producing countries at a Baghdad conference on September 14, 1960. The five founding members of OPEC were Venezuela, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Kuwait. OPEC was organized after the oil companies slashed the posted price of oil, but the posted price of oil remained consistently higher than the market price of oil between 1961 and 1972. In 1963, the Seven Sisters controlled 86% of the oil produced by OPEC countries, but by 1970 the rise of \\"independent oil companies\\" had decreased their share to 77%. The entry of three new oil producers‚ÄîAlgeria, Libya and Nigeria‚Äîmeant that by 1970 81 oil companies were doing business in the Middle East. In the early 1960s Libya, Indonesia and Qatar joined OPEC. OPEC was generally regarded as ineffective until political turbulence in Libya and Iraq strengthened their position in 1970. Additionally, increasing Soviet influence provided oil producing countries with alternative means of transporting oil to markets. Under the Tehran Price Agreement of 1971, the posted price of oil was increased and, due to a decline in the value of the US dollar relative to gold, certain anti-inflationary measures were enacted.For a discussion about the impact of inflation on the purchasing power of oil revenues in the 1970s see In September 1973, Richard Nixon said, \\"Oil without a market, as Mr. Mossadegh learned many, many years ago, does not do a country much good\\", referring to the 1951 nationalization of the Iranian oil industry, but between October 1973 and February 1974 the OPEC countries raised by posted price fourfold to nearly $12. =End of Bretton Woods= On August 15, 1971, the United States unilaterally pulled out of the Bretton Woods Accord. The US abandoned the Gold Exchange Standard whereby the value of the dollar had been pegged to the price of gold and all other currencies were pegged to the dollar, whose value was left to \\"float\\" (rise and fall according to market demand). Shortly thereafter, Britain followed, floating the pound sterling. The other industrialized nations followed suit with their respective currencies. Anticipating that currency values would fluctuate unpredictably for a time, the industrialized nations increased their reserves (by expanding their money supplies) in amounts far greater than before. The result was a depreciation of the dollar and other industrialized nations' currencies. Because oil was priced in dollars, oil producers' real income decreased. In September 1971, OPEC issued a joint communiqu√© stating that from then on, they would price oil in terms of a fixed amount of gold. This contributed to the \\"oil shock\\". After 1971, OPEC was slow to readjust prices to reflect this depreciation. From 1947 to 1967, the dollar price of oil had risen by less than two percent per year. Until the oil shock, the price had also remained fairly stable versus other currencies and commodities. OPEC ministers had not developed institutional mechanisms to update prices in sync with changing market conditions, so their real incomes lagged. The substantial price increases of 1973‚Äì1974 largely returned their prices and corresponding incomes to Bretton Woods levels in terms of commodities such as gold. =The \\"oil weapon\\"= Arab oil producing countries had attempted to use oil as leverage to influence political events on two prior occasions‚Äîthe first was the Suez Crisis in 1956 when the United Kingdom, France and Israel invaded Egypt. During the conflict the Syrians sabotaged both the Trans-Arabian Pipeline and the Iraq‚ÄìBaniyas pipeline, which disrupted the supply of oil to Western Europe. The second instance was when war broke out between Egypt and Israel in 1967, but despite continued Egyptian and Syrian enmity against Israel, the embargo lasted only a few months. Most scholars agree that the 1967 embargo was ineffective. Although some members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) supported the use of oil as a weapon to influence the political outcome of the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict, Saudi Arabia had traditionally been the strongest supporter of separating oil from politics. The Saudis were wary of the tactic due to the availability of oil from non- Arab oil producing countries, and in the decades leading up to the crisis, the region's conservative monarchies had grown dependent on Western support to ensure their continued survival as Nasserism gained traction. On the other hand, Algeria, Iraq and Libya had strongly supported the use of oil as a weapon in the conflict. Arab newspapers like the Egyptian Al-Ahram, Lebanese An-Nahar and Iraqi Al-Thawra had historically been supportive of the use of oil as a weapon. On October 6, 1973, Egypt attacked the Bar Lev Line in the Sinai Peninsula and Syria launched an offensive in the Golan Heights, both of which had been occupied by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War. On October 12, 1973, US president Richard Nixon authorized Operation Nickel Grass, a strategic airlift to deliver weapons and supplies to Israel in order to replace its materiel losses,October 9, 1973 conversation (6:10-6:35 pm) between Israeli Ambassador to the United States Simcha Dinitz, Henry Kissinger, Brent Scowcroft, and Peter Rodman. Transcript George Washington University National Security Archive after the Soviet Union began sending arms to Syria and Egypt. The following day, on October 17, Arab oil producers cut production by 5% and instituted an oil embargo against Israel's allies: the United States, the Netherlands, Rhodesia, South Africa, and Portugal. Saudi Arabia only consented to the embargo after Nixon's promise of $2.2 billion in military aid to Israel. The embargo was accompanied by gradual monthly production cuts‚Äîby December, production had been cut to 25% of September levels. This contributed to a global recession and increased tension between the United States and its European allies, who faulted the US for provoking an embargo by providing assistance to Israel. OAPEC demanded a complete Israeli withdrawal from all territories beyond the 1949 Armistice border. Effectiveness of embargo The embargo lasted from October 1973 to March 1974. Since Israeli forces did not withdraw to the 1949 Armistice Line, the majority of scholars believe that the embargo was a failure. Roy Licklieder, in his 1988 book Political Power and the Arab Oil Weapon, concluded that the embargo was a failure because the countries that were targeted by the embargo did not change their policies on the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict. Licklieder believed that any long term changes were caused by the OPEC increase in the posted price of oil, and not the OAPEC embargo. Daniel Yergin, on the other hand, has said that the embargo \\"remade the international economy\\". Over the long term, the oil embargo changed the nature of policy in the West towards increased exploration, alternative energy research, energy conservation and more restrictive monetary policy to better fight inflation.

Effects =Immediate economic effects= A man at a service station reads about the gasoline rationing system in an afternoon newspaper; a sign in the background states that no gasoline is available. 1974 The effects of the embargo were immediate. OPEC forced oil companies to increase payments drastically. The price of oil quadrupled by 1974 from US$3 to nearly US$12 per barrel ($75 per cubic meter), equivalent in 2018 dollars to a price rise from $ to $ per barrel. This price increase had a dramatic effect on oil exporting nations, for the countries of the Middle East who had long been dominated by the industrial powers were seen to have taken control of a vital commodity. The oil-exporting nations began to accumulate vast wealth. Some of the income was dispensed in the form of aid to other underdeveloped nations whose economies had been caught between higher oil prices and lower prices for their own export commodities, amid shrinking Western demand. Much went for arms purchases that exacerbated political tensions, particularly in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia spent over 100 billion dollars in the ensuing decades for helping spread its fundamentalist interpretation of Islam, known as Wahhabism, throughout the world, via religious charities such as the al-Haramain Foundation, which often also distributed funds to violent Sunni extremist groups such as Al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Control of oil became known as the \\"oil weapon\\". It came in the form of an embargo and production cutbacks from the Arab states. The weapon was aimed at the United States, Great Britain, Canada, Japan and the Netherlands. These target governments perceived that the intent was to push them towards a more pro-Arab position. Production was eventually cut by 25%. However, the affected countries did not undertake dramatic policy changes. In the United States, scholars argue that there already existed a negotiated settlement based on equality between both parties prior to 1973. The possibility that the Middle East could become another superpower confrontation with the USSR was of more concern to the US than oil. Further, interest groups and government agencies more worried about energy were no match for Kissinger's dominance. In the US production, distribution and price disruptions \\"have been held responsible for recessions, periods of excessive inflation, reduced productivity, and lower economic growth.\\" Some researchers regard the 1973 \\"oil price shock\\" and the accompanying 1973‚Äì74 stock market crash as the first discrete event since the Great Depression to have a persistent effect on the US economy. The embargo had a negative influence on the US economy by causing immediate demands to address the threats to U.S. energy security. On an international level, the price increases changed competitive positions in many industries, such as automobiles. Macroeconomic problems consisted of both inflationary and deflationary impacts. The embargo left oil companies searching for new ways to increase oil supplies, even in rugged terrain such as the Arctic. Finding oil and developing new fields usually required five to 10 years before significant production. Gas stealers beware, 1974 OPEC-member states raised the prospect of nationalization of oil company holdings. Most notably, Saudi Arabia nationalized Aramco in 1980 under the leadership of Saudi oil minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani. As other OPEC nations followed suit, the cartel's income soared. Saudi Arabia undertook a series of ambitious five-year development plans. The biggest began in 1980, funded at $250 billion. Other cartel members also undertook major economic development programs. The average US retail price of a gallon of regular gasoline rose 43% from 38.5¬¢ in May 1973 to 55.1¬¢ in June 1974. State governments asked citizens not to put up Christmas lights. Oregon banned Christmas and commercial lighting altogether. Politicians called for a national gasoline rationing program. Nixon asked gasoline retailers to voluntarily not sell gasoline on Saturday nights or Sundays; 90% of gas station owners complied, which produced long lines of motorists wanting to fill up their cars while they still could. The embargo was not uniform across Europe. Of the nine members of the European Economic Community (EEC), the Netherlands faced a complete embargo, the UK and France received almost uninterrupted supplies (having refused to allow the US to use their airfields and embargoed arms and supplies to both the Arabs and the Israelis), while the other six faced partial cutbacks. The UK had traditionally been an ally of Israel, and Harold Wilson's government supported the Israelis during the Six- Day War. His successor, Ted Heath, reversed this policy in 1970, calling for Israel to withdraw to its pre-1967 borders. The EEC was unable to achieve a common policy during the first month of the embargo. It issued a statement on November 6, after the embargo and price rises had begun. It was widely viewed as pro-Arab, supporting the Franco-British line on the war. OPEC duly lifted its embargo from all EEC members. The price rises had a much greater impact in Europe than the embargo. Despite being relatively unaffected by the embargo, the UK nonetheless faced an oil crisis of its own‚Äîa series of strikes by coal miners and railroad workers over the winter of 1973‚Äì74 became a major factor in the change of government. Heath asked the British to heat only one room in their houses over the winter. The UK, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Norway banned flying, driving and boating on Sundays. Sweden rationed gasoline and heating oil. The Netherlands imposed prison sentences for those who used more than their ration of electricity. A few months later, the crisis eased. The embargo was lifted in March 1974 after negotiations at the Washington Oil Summit, but the effects lingered throughout the 1970s. The dollar price of energy increased again the following year, amid the weakening competitive position of the dollar in world markets. =Price controls and rationing= United States Oregon gasoline dealers displayed signs explaining the flag policy in the winter of 1973‚Äì74 Price controls exacerbated the crisis in the US. The system limited the price of \\"old oil\\" (that which had already been discovered) while allowing newly discovered oil to be sold at a higher price to encourage investment. Predictably, old oil was withdrawn from the market, creating greater scarcity. The rule also discouraged development of alternative energies. The rule had been intended to promote oil exploration. Scarcity was addressed by rationing (as in many countries). Motorists faced long lines at gas stations beginning in summer 1972 and increasing by summer 1973. In 1973, Nixon named William E. Simon as the first Administrator of the Federal Energy Office, a short-term organization created to coordinate the response to the embargo. Simon allocated states the same amount of domestic oil for 1974 that each had consumed in 1972, which worked for states whose populations were not increasing. In other states, lines at gasoline stations were common. The American Automobile Association reported that in the last week of February 1974, 20% of American gasoline stations had no fuel. Odd‚Äìeven rationing allowed vehicles with license plates having an odd number as the last digit (or a vanity license plate) to buy gas only on odd-numbered days of the month, while others could buy only on even-numbered days. In some states, a three-color flag system was used to denote gasoline availability at service stations‚Äîgreen for unrationed availability, yellow for restricted/rationed sales and red for out of stock. Gasoline ration stamps printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in 1974, but not used Rationing led to violent incidents, when truck drivers chose to strike for two days in December 1973 over the limited supplies that Simon had allocated for their industry. In Pennsylvania and Ohio, non-striking truckers were shot at by striking truckers, and in Arkansas, trucks of non-strikers were attacked with bombs. America had controlled the price of natural gas since the 1950s. With the inflation of the 1970s, the price was too low to encourage the search for new reserves. America's natural gas reserves dwindled from 237 trillion in 1974 to 203 trillion in 1978. The price controls were not changed, despite president Gerald Ford's repeated requests to Congress. =Conservation and reduction in demand= United States To help reduce consumption, in 1974 a national maximum speed limit of 55 mph (about 88 km/h) was imposed through the Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act. Development of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve began in 1975, and in 1977 the cabinet-level Department of Energy was created, followed by the National Energy Act of 1978. On November 28, 1995, President Bill Clinton signed the National Highway Designation Act, ending the federal 55 mph (89 km/h) speed limit which allowed states to restore their prior maximum speed limit. Year-round daylight saving time was implemented from January 6, 1974, to October 27, 1975, with a break between October 27, 1974 and February 23, 1975, when the country observed standard time. The move spawned significant criticism because it forced many children to travel to school before sunrise. The prior rules were restored in 1976. Potlatch, Washington, was turned into a revival hall. The crisis prompted a call to conserve energy, most notably a campaign by the Advertising Council using the tagline \\"Don't Be Fuelish\\". Many newspapers carried advertisements featuring cut-outs that could be attached to light switches, reading \\"Last Out, Lights Out: Don't Be Fuelish\\". By 1980, domestic luxury cars with a wheelbase and gross weights averaging 4,500 pounds (2,041 kg) were no longer made. The automakers had begun phasing out the traditional front engine/rear wheel drive layout in compact cars in favor of lighter front engine/front wheel drive designs. A higher percentage of cars offered more efficient four- cylinder engines. Domestic auto makers also began offering more fuel efficient diesel powered passenger cars as well. Although not regulated by the new legislation, auto racing groups voluntarily began conserving. In 1974, NASCAR reduced all race distances by 10%; the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 12 Hours of Sebring race were cancelled. In 1976, Congress created the Weatherization Assistance Program to help low-income homeowners and renters reduce their demand for heating and cooling through better insulation. =Alternative energy sources= wood in a fireplace for heat. A newspaper headline before her tells of the community's lack of heating oil. The energy crisis led to greater interest in renewable energy, nuclear power and domestic fossil fuels.The 1970s Energy Crisis According to Peter Grossman, American energy policies since the crisis have been dominated by crisis-mentality thinking, promoting expensive quick fixes and single-shot solutions that ignore market and technology realities. He wrote that instead of providing stable rules that support basic research while leaving plenty of scope for entrepreneurship and innovation, Congresses and presidents have repeatedly backed policies which promise solutions that are politically expedient, but whose prospects are doubtful. The Brazilian government implemented its \\"Pro√°lcool\\" (pro-alcohol) project in 1975 that mixed ethanol with gasoline for automotive fuel. Israel was one of the few countries unaffected by the embargo, since it could extract sufficient oil from the Sinai. But to supplement Israel's over-taxed power grid, Harry Zvi Tabor, the father of Israel's solar industry, developed the prototype for a solar water heater now used in over 90% of Israeli homes.At the Zenith of Solar Energy , Neal Sandler,BusinessWeek, March 26, 2008. =Macroeconomy= The crisis was a major factor in shifting Japan's economy away from oil-intensive industries. Investment shifted to industries such as electronics. Japanese auto makers also benefited from the crisis. Increased fuel costs allowed their small, fuel-efficient models to gain market share from the \\"gas-guzzling\\" American competition. This triggered a drop in American auto sales that lasted into the 1980s. Western central banks decided to sharply cut interest rates to encourage growth, deciding that inflation was a secondary concern. Although this was the orthodox macroeconomic prescription at the time, the resulting stagflation surprised economists and central bankers. The policy is now considered by some to have deepened and lengthened the adverse effects of the embargo. Recent research claims that in the period after 1985 the economy became more resilient to energy price increases. The price shock created large current account deficits in oil-importing economies. A petrodollar recycling mechanism was created, through which OPEC surplus funds were channeled through the capital markets to the West to finance the current account deficits. The functioning of this mechanism required the relaxation of capital controls in oil-importing economies. It marked the beginning of an exponential growth of Western capital markets. In 1974, seven of the 15 top Fortune 500 companies were oil companies, falling to four in 2014. =International relations= The crisis had a major impact on international relations and created a rift within NATO. Some European nations and Japan sought to disassociate themselves from United States foreign policy in the Middle East to avoid being targeted by the boycott. Arab oil producers linked any future policy changes to peace between the belligerents. To address this, the Nixon Administration began multilateral negotiations with the combatants. They arranged for Israel to pull back from the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights. By January 18, 1974, US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had negotiated an Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the Sinai Peninsula. The promise of a negotiated settlement between Israel and Syria was enough to convince Arab oil producers to lift the embargo in March 1974. and again during the 1979 energy crisis. United States America's Cold War policies suffered a major blow from the embargo. They had focused on China and the Soviet Union, but the latent challenge to US hegemony coming from the Third World became evident. In 2004, declassified documents revealed that the US was so distraught by the rise in oil prices and being challenged by under- developed countries that they briefly considered military action to forcibly seize Middle Eastern oilfields in late 1973. Although no explicit plan was mentioned, a conversation between U.S. Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger and British Ambassador to the United States Lord Cromer revealed Schlesinger had told him that \\"it was no longer obvious to him that the U.S. could not use force.\\" British Prime Minister Edward Heath was so worried by this prospect that he ordered a British intelligence estimate of US intentions, which concluded that America \\"might consider it could not tolerate a situation in which the U.S. and its allies were at the mercy of a small group of unreasonable countries\\", and that they would prefer a rapid operation to seize oilfields in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and possibly Abu Dhabi if military action was decided upon. Although the Soviet response to such an act would likely not involve force, intelligence warned \\"the American occupation would need to last 10 years as the West developed alternative energy sources, and would result in the 'total alienation' of the Arabs and much of the rest of the Third World.\\" NATO Western Europe began switching from pro-Israel to more pro-Arab policies.America, Russia, and the Cold War, 1945‚Äì1975, p. 280, Walter LaFeber, Wiley, 1975Far Eastern Economic Review, v.84, Apr‚ÄìJun 1974, p. 8, Review Publishing, 1974The New Tensions in Japan, Martin Collick, Richard Storry, p. 16, Institute for the Study of Conflict, 1974 This change strained the Western alliance. The US, which imported only 12% of its oil from the Middle East (compared with 80% for the Europeans and over 90% for Japan), remained staunchly committed to Israel. The percentage of US oil which comes from the nations bordering the Persian Gulf remained steady over the decades, with a figure of a little more than 10% in 2008.Afshin Molavi, \\"Obama, Gulf Oil and the Myth of America's Addiction\\", New America Foundation, The National (United Arab Emirates), January 21, 2009, . Retrieved August 16, 2009. Archived August 21, 2009. With the embargo in place, many developed countries altered their policies regarding the Arab-Israeli conflict. These included the UK, which refused to allow the United States to use British bases and Cyprus to airlift resupplies to Israel, along with the rest of the members of the European Community. Canada shifted towards a more pro-Arab position after displeasure was expressed towards Canada's mostly neutral position. \\"On the other hand, after the embargo the Canadian government moved quickly indeed toward the Arab position, despite its low dependence on Middle Eastern oil\\". Japan Although lacking historical connections to the Middle East, Japan was the country most dependent on Arab oil. 71% of its imported oil came from the Middle East in 1970. On November 7, 1973, the Saudi and Kuwaiti governments declared Japan a \\"nonfriendly\\" country to encourage it to change its noninvolvement policy. It received a 5% production cut in December, causing a panic. On November 22, Japan issued a statement \\"asserting that Israel should withdraw from all of the 1967 territories, advocating Palestinian self-determination, and threatening to reconsider its policy toward Israel if Israel refused to accept these preconditions\\". By December 25, Japan was considered an Arab-friendly state. Nonaligned nations The oil embargo was announced roughly one month after a right-wing military coup in Chile led by General Augusto Pinochet toppled socialist president Salvador Allende on September 11, 1973. The response of the Nixon administration was to propose doubling arms sales. As a consequence, an opposing Latin American bloc was organized and financed in part by Venezuelan oil revenues, which quadrupled between 1970 and 1975. A year after the start of the embargo, the UN's nonaligned bloc passed a resolution demanding the creation of a \\"New International Economic Order\\" under which nations within the global South would receive a greater share of benefits derived from the exploitation of southern resources and greater control over their self- development. Arab states Prior to the embargo, the geo-political competition between the Soviet Union and the United States, in combination with low oil prices that hindered the necessity and feasibility of alternative energy sources, presented the Arab States with financial security, moderate economic growth, and disproportionate international bargaining power.Ritchie Ovendale, The Origins of the Arab-Israeli Wars (New York: Pearson Longman, 2004), p. 184-191 and 197 The oil shock disrupted the status quo relationships between Arab countries and the US and USSR. At the time, Egypt, Syria and Iraq were allied with the USSR, while Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Iran (plus Israel) aligned with the US. Vacillations in alignment often resulted in greater support from the respective superpowers. When Anwar Sadat became president of Egypt in 1970, he dismissed Soviet specialists in Egypt and reoriented towards the US. Concerns over economic domination from increased Soviet oil production turned into fears of military aggression after the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, turning the Persian Gulf states towards the US for security guarantees against Soviet military action. The USSR's invasion of Afghanistan was only one sign of insecurity in the region, also marked by increased American weapons sales, technology, and outright military presence. Saudi Arabia and Iran became increasingly dependent on American security assurances to manage both external and internal threats, including increased military competition between them over increased oil revenues. Both states were competing for preeminence in the Persian Gulf and using increased revenues to fund expanded militaries. By 1979, Saudi arms purchases from the US exceeded five times Israel's.George C. Wilson \\"U.S. Military Sales To Saudis 5 Times Total For Israelis\\", Washington Post October 11, 1979, pg. A24 In the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution the Saudis were forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization via the radicalism of Islamism, a reality which would quickly be revealed in the Grand Mosque seizure in Mecca by Wahhabi extremists during November 1979, and a Shiite Muslim revolt in the oil rich Al-Hasa region of Saudi Arabia in December of the same year, which was known as the 1979 Qatif Uprising.Daniel Yergin, The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1991). Saudi Arabia is a near- absolute monarchy, an Arabic speaking country, and has a Sunni Muslim majority, while Persian speaking Iran since 1979 is an Islamist theocracy with a Shiite Muslim majority, which explains the current hostility between Saudi Arabia and Iran.Michael Rubin, Iran and Saudi Arabia's 'Hate-Hate' Relationship. (http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2011/10/11/iran-and-saudi- arabias-hate-hate-relationship/ ). CNN, October 11, 2011, 8:00 PM ET. =Automobile industry= The oil crisis sent a signal to the auto industry globally, which changed many aspects of production and usage for decades to come. Western Europe After World War II, most West European countries taxed motor fuel to limit imports, and as a result most cars made in Europe were smaller and more economical than their American counterparts. By the late 1960s, increasing incomes supported rising car sizes. The oil crisis pushed West European car buyers away from larger, less economical cars. The most notable result of this transition was the rise in popularity of compact hatchbacks. The only notable small hatchbacks built in Western Europe before the oil crisis were the Peugeot 104, Renault 5 and Fiat 127\\\\. By the end of the decade, the market had expanded with the introduction of the Ford Fiesta, Opel Kadett (sold as the Vauxhall Astra in Great Britain), Chrysler Sunbeam and Citro√´n Visa. Buyers looking for larger cars were increasingly drawn to medium-sized hatchbacks. Virtually unknown in Europe in 1973, by the end of the decade they were gradually replacing sedans as the mainstay of this sector. Between 1973 and 1980, medium-sized hatchbacks were launched across Europe: the Chrysler/Simca Horizon, Fiat Ritmo (Strada in the UK), Ford Escort MK3, Renault 14, Volvo 340 / 360, Opel Kadett, and Volkswagen Golf. These cars were considerably more economical than the traditional saloons they were replacing, and attracted buyers who traditionally bought larger vehicles. Some 15 years after the oil crisis, hatchbacks dominated most European small and medium car markets, and had gained a substantial share of the large family car market. United States Before the energy crisis, large, heavy, and powerful cars were popular. By 1971, the standard engine in a Chevrolet Caprice was a 400-cubic inch (6.5 liter) V8. The wheelbase of this car was , and Motor Trend's 1972 road test of the similar Chevrolet Impala achieved no more than 15 highway miles per gallon. In the 15 years prior to the 1973 oil crisis, gasoline prices in the U.S. had lagged well behind inflation. The crisis reduced the demand for large cars. Japanese imports, primarily the Toyota Corona, the Toyota Corolla, the Datsun B210, the Datsun 510, the Honda Civic, the Mitsubishi Galant (a captive import from Chrysler sold as the Dodge Colt), the Subaru DL, and later the Honda Accord all had four cylinder engines that were more fuel efficient than the typical American V8 and six cylinder engines. Japanese imports became mass-market leaders with unibody construction and front-wheel drive, which became de facto standards. From Europe, the Volkswagen Beetle, the Volkswagen Fastback, the Renault 8, the Renault LeCar, and the Fiat Brava were successful. Detroit responded with the Ford Pinto, the Ford Maverick, the Chevrolet Vega, the Chevrolet Nova, the Plymouth Valiant and the Plymouth Volar√©. American Motors sold its homegrown Gremlin, Hornet and Pacer models. Some buyers lamented the small size of the first Japanese compacts, and both Toyota and Nissan (then known as Datsun) introduced larger cars such as the Toyota Corona Mark II, the Toyota Cressida, the Mazda 616 and Datsun 810, which added passenger space and amenities such as air conditioning, power steering, AM-FM radios, and even power windows and central locking without increasing the price of the vehicle. A decade after the 1973 oil crisis, Honda, Toyota and Nissan, affected by the 1981 voluntary export restraints, opened US assembly plants and established their luxury divisions (Acura, Lexus and Infiniti, respectively) to distinguish themselves from their mass-market brands. Compact trucks were introduced, such as the Toyota Hilux and the Datsun Truck, followed by the Mazda Truck (sold as the Ford Courier), and the Isuzu-built Chevrolet LUV. Mitsubishi rebranded its Forte as the Dodge D-50 a few years after the oil crisis. Mazda, Mitsubishi and Isuzu had joint partnerships with Ford, Chrysler, and GM, respectively. Later, the American makers introduced their domestic replacements (Ford Ranger, Dodge Dakota and the Chevrolet S10/GMC S-15), ending their captive import policy. An increase in imported cars into North America forced General Motors, Ford and Chrysler to introduce smaller and fuel-efficient models for domestic sales. The Dodge Omni / Plymouth Horizon from Chrysler, the Ford Fiesta and the Chevrolet Chevette all had four-cylinder engines and room for at least four passengers by the late 1970s. By 1985, the average American vehicle moved 17.4 miles per gallon, compared to 13.5 in 1970. The improvements stayed, even though the price of a barrel of oil remained constant at $12 from 1974 to 1979. Sales of large sedans for most makes (except Chrysler products) recovered within two model years of the 1973 crisis. The Cadillac DeVille and Fleetwood, Buick Electra, Oldsmobile 98, Lincoln Continental, Mercury Marquis, and various other luxury oriented sedans became popular again in the mid-1970s. The only full-size models that did not recover were lower price models such as the Chevrolet Bel Air and Ford Galaxie 500. Slightly smaller models such as the Oldsmobile Cutlass, Chevrolet Monte Carlo, Ford Thunderbird and various others sold well. Economical imports succeeded alongside heavy, expensive vehicles. In 1976, Toyota sold 346,920 cars (average weight around 2,100 lbs), while Cadillac sold 309,139 cars (average weight around 5,000 lbs). Federal safety standards, such as NHTSA Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 215 (pertaining to safety bumpers), and compacts like the 1974 Mustang I were a prelude to the DOT \\"downsize\\" revision of vehicle categories. By 1977, GM's full-sized cars reflected the crisis. By 1979, virtually all \\"full-size\\" American cars had shrunk, featuring smaller engines and smaller outside dimensions. Chrysler ended production of their full-sized luxury sedans at the end of the 1981 model year, moving instead to a full front-wheel drive lineup for 1982 (except for the M-body Dodge Diplomat/Plymouth Gran Fury and Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue sedans). Decline of OPEC OPEC soon lost its preeminent position, and in 1981, its production was surpassed by that of other countries. Additionally, its own member nations were divided. Saudi Arabia, trying to recover market share, increased production, pushing prices down, shrinking or eliminating profits for high-cost producers. The world price, which had peaked during the 1979 energy crisis at nearly $40 per barrel, decreased during the 1980s to less than $10 per barrel. Adjusted for inflation, oil briefly fell back to pre-1973 levels. This \\"sale\\" price was a windfall for oil-importing nations, both developing and developed. The embargo encouraged new venues for energy exploration, including Alaska, the North Sea, the Caspian Sea, and the Caucasus. Exploration in the Caspian Basin and Siberia became profitable. Cooperation changed into a far more adversarial relationship as the USSR increased its production. By 1980, the Soviet Union had become the world's largest producer.\\"World: Saudis Edge U.S. on Oil\\" in Washington Post January 3, 1980, pg. D2Dusko Doder \\"Soviet Production of Gas, Oil Set Records Over 6 Months\\" in Washington Post August 14, 1980, pg. A24 Part of the decline in prices and economic and geopolitical power of OPEC came from the move to alternative energy sources. OPEC had relied on price inelasticity to maintain high consumption, but had underestimated the extent to which conservation and other sources of supply would eventually reduce demand. Electricity generation from nuclear power and natural gas, home heating from natural gas, and ethanol-blended gasoline all reduced the demand for oil. The drop in prices presented a serious problem for oil-exporting countries in northern Europe and the Persian Gulf. Heavily populated, impoverished countries, whose economies were largely dependent on oil‚Äîincluding Mexico, Nigeria, Algeria, and Libya‚Äîdid not prepare for a market reversal that left them in sometimes desperate situations. When reduced demand and increased production glutted the world market in the mid-1980s, oil prices plummeted and the cartel lost its unity. Mexico (a non-member), Nigeria, and Venezuela, whose economies had expanded in the 1970s, faced near-bankruptcy, and even Saudi Arabian economic power was significantly weakened. The divisions within OPEC made concerted action more difficult. , OPEC has never approached its earlier dominance.

Originally called Harrowsmith, the magazine was heralded as a back-to- the-land and environmental issues platform. In 1976, founder James M. Lawrence cut and paste the first issues together on a kitchen table in the tiny village of Camden East (pop. 256) in Ontario, Canada. Within two years, the magazine had over 100,000 subscribers and eventually became Canada's 8th largest magazine. Camden House Publishing Inc. was created in 1977 as the parent company for the Harrowsmith and Equinox magazines and later for many books. In 1988, Lawrence sold Harrowsmith to the Canadian media giant Telemedia, where it remained until 1996. Telemedia launched an American edition, and the words \\"Country Life\\" were tacked onto Harrowsmith's title. The American edition reached a paid circulation of 225,000 but folded as Telemedia began making changes to their publishing business. Editor Tom Cruickshank took the helm of Harrowsmith Country Life in 1996, after Telemedia sold Harrowsmith Country Life, and its sister publication Equinox, to Malcolm Publishing, a Montreal, company. Equinox ceased publishing in 2000 and its mailing list was sold to Canadian Geographic. Harrowsmith went on to celebrate 30 years of publishing in 2006. Harrowsmith TV exists as re-runs and Harrowsmith books can still be found. Some titles, such as the Harrowsmith Cookbook (three volumes) are still available through Amazon and Firefly Books. Telemedia no longer exists and many of its assets were sold to Transcontinental Media in 2000. In 2011, Harrowsmith Country Life published a single issue in March, and in August 2011 the magazine announced that it would cease publication just short of its 35th anniversary issue.Harrowsmith_Country_Life#cite_note-globemail_2011-1 It failed to notify subscribers that the magazine would suspend publishing and those subscribers who had paid for their magazines in advance did not have their money refunded. In the fall of 2012, after obtaining the licensing rights to Harrowsmith, Yolanda Thornton, a former employee, revived Harrowsmith magazine starting with its sister publication: Harrowsmith's Truly Canadian Almanac for 2013.Harrowsmith_Country_Life#cite_note- masthead_almanac-2 Moongate Inc. (Toronto, ON) which is also owned by Yolanda Thornton assumed the publishing for Harrowsmith. In the spring of 2013, a second issue was added: Harrowsmith's Gardening Digest.Harrowsmith_Country_Life#cite_note-masthead_garden-3 In 2015 the addition of two more titles saw the release of four issues that year: Harrowsmith's Gardening Digest, Harrowsmith's My Kind of Town, Harrowsmith's Homes and the annual 2015 Harrowsmith's Almanac. For the 2015 annual fall almanac edition (published September 2014), the title was shortened to Harrowsmith's Almanac. In 2015 and 2016, Harrowsmith embraced the digital market and reached a wider audience with a new format. Two print issues were published (spring and fall) and two online editions (summer and winter) were included in annual subscriptions. \\"Country Life\\" was dropped from the title. In 2017, Harrowsmith redesigned their website to create a virtual community beyond the magazine's pages. They released their first full-size magazine Winter edition in response to reader demand.

He was the leader of the Fiji coup of 2000, in which he and an elite unit of Fiji's military detained thirty-six members of parliament and held them hostage from May 19, 2000 to July 13, 2000. He is serving life imprisonment for his role in the coup. He was detained in Nukulau island before being sentenced.  Fiji coup of 2000  On May 19, 2000, a disparate gang led by Speight stormed the parliamentary complex and kidnapped Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and 35 other parliamentarians for the i Taukei (indigenous) rights, including several cabinet ministers. Announcing that he had deposed both the government and the President, Speight swore in serving ruling government member Timoci Silatolu as Prime Minister, and proclaimed Jope Seniloli president in place of Kamisese Mara. Seniloli has since been convicted of treason for aiding and abetting the coup. President Mara tried to resist Speight's takeover, but was abruptly removed himself on 29 May by Commodore Frank Bainimarama, the Commander of the Military who subsequently abrogated the constitution, made himself Prime Minister and swore in his own President, Ratu Epeli Nailatikau (Ratu Jope Seniloli's cousin). The overthrow of the government saw support for Speight's cause as outbreaks of violence occurred in Suva, Levuka, Naitasiri, Tailevu, Ra, Nadi, Yasawa, Serua, Namosi, and on July 7 an army base on Vanua Levu Island was overrun by his supporters. Fifteen soldiers and two of their officers defected to the rebels and George Speight built up a strong private army. On June 9, Speight announced that he had abolished Fiji's multi-racial Constitution. Three days later, Speight's car was sprayed with gunfire, but the army denied that soldiers were involved in an operation to kill him. On June 25, four female hostages were released. On July 13, Chaudhry was released following an agreement between the rebels and the military administration of Commodore Bainimarama. Claiming that he had signed the agreement \\"under duress,\\" Bainimarama promptly rescinded it. On 27 July, Speight was arrested with 369 of his followers and charged with treason.  Motives for the coup  Speight claimed to be a Fijian nationalist and a champion of indigenous rights. He attracted support from elements of the Fijian population who were angered by the results of the 1999 election, which had swept away a government dominated by ethnic Fijians and brought to power a multiracial government led by Mahendra Chaudhry, who became Fiji's first-ever Indo-Fijian Prime Minister. Hints that the Chaudhry government might institute some form of land reform also generated considerable resentment among sections of the indigenous population, despite constitutional guarantees that ethnic Fijian ownership of 83 percent of the land could not be changed without the support of 9 of the 14 senators appointed by the Great Council of Chiefs, a wholly indigenous body. The lead-up to the coup had seen politicians and other public figures play upon this resentment and foster public fear that native land might be alienated. Speight thus found a sizeable number of sympathizers when he launched the coup on 19 May. Speight's partner, Torika Rawlinson, told the student newspaper Wansolwara that the original intention had been to execute members of the deposed government the night before the coup actually took place. She denied others' reports that Indo-Fijian businessmen had been involved.  Elected to and expelled from Parliament  In August 2001, democracy was restored and in the subsequent election Speight was elected to the House of Representatives using the name of Ilikimi Naitini. He was elected as a Representative for the Tailevu North Fijian Communal constituency as a candidate of the Conservative Alliance Matanitu Vanua Party despite his confinement on Nukulau Island. Speight was prevented by the speaker of the Fiji parliament, Epeli Nailatikau, from taking up his seat in Parliament. That December he was expelled from Parliament for non-attendance. Sentence  On 18 February 2002, Speight was sentenced to death after pleading guilty to a charge of treason. However, the government of the Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase had abolished the death sentence in the House of Representatives on the day that Speight was sentenced. President Josefa Iloilo, who had replaced Mara following the coup, followed the advice of the Prime Minister and commuted Speight's sentence to life imprisonment. Speight started serving his sentence on Nukulau Island where he had been living in exile. Following the decision of the military government to close the Nukulau facility, Speight was transferred on 20 December 2006. He is currently serving his sentence at the Naboro Maximum Security Prison.  Purported change of heart  On 15 September 2004, a source close to the Fijian government revealed that Speight had renewed his faith in Christianity during his imprisonment. According to the source, Speight's faith had led to a change of heart towards the Indo-Fijian community, and that he wished to participate in the upcoming Fiji Week, a series of prayer meetings and multicultural programmes aimed at reconciling Fiji's ethnic communities, planned for the week of 4 October through 11 October. \\"He now feels inspired by the word of God and would like to take part in the week of reconciliation,\\" the source told the Australian Associated Press. This request for permission to leave his island prison to take part in the observances was refused, however. A spokesman for deposed Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry said that he would be prepared to meet with Speight in principle, provided that he reveal the identities of the persons who had planned and financed the coup. The Fiji Village news service reported on 29 January 2006 that Speight and his associates had indicated his willingness to face the government's proposed Reconciliation and Unity Commission and reveal what they knew about the planning, financing, and execution of the coup. This was an apparent reversal of his earlier vow to remain silent. Fiji Live quoted Speight as alleging that the real reason for the strident opposition of the military to the legislation establishing the proposed Commission was that their and, in particular, Bainimarama's own role in the coup plot would be in danger of being revealed. The latest information revealed by some of the CRW troops arrested with Speight suggest that Bainimarama may have been the real coup leader after giving the go-ahead at the last security council meeting on Friday May 12, 2000 at Valelevu. Bainimara's subsequent departure for Norway ensured that he was free from coup conspiracy. On his return not long after the takeover he sent a delegation made up of military spokesmen Colonel Filipo Tarakinikini, Colonel Etueni Caucau and acting Commander Colonel Tuatoko to express his full support for Speight and ex SAS Warrant Officer, Ilisoni Ligairi. Both men were unaware of the pre-coup arrangements set up by Bainimarama. A dispute arose, though, as to who should be in the caretaker government as Bainimarama expected to run the country with a few of his close advisers such as Colonel Jerry Waqanisau, Colonel Kacisolomoni, Colonel Paul Manueli and others. This conflict led to a 56-day rule by Bainimarama after which he was forced to step down by Speight and to return the office of the Presidency to civilian rule. Inside sources allege that Bainimarama manipulated his oblivious officers to finally achieve his pre-May 19, 2000 objectives of ruling the country. The University of the South Pacific journalism school in Fiji provided coverage of the upheaval on its website Pacific Journalism Online and newspaper Wansolwara until its website was temporarily shut down on May 29 during the martial law period. The students' coverage archive is at the University of Technology, Sydney, Australia.  Personal life  George Speight hails from Naivicula, about ten kilometers from Korovou in Tailevu Province. He is the son of Sam Speight (sometimes known as Savenaca Tokainavo), a prosperous farmer of ethnic Fijian and European descent. The elder Speight is a war veteran who served in the successful Malayan campaign. He subsequently served as a backbencher in Rabuka's governments throughout the 1990s. By the time his son attempted his coup in 2000, however, Sam Speight was an opposition member of Parliament, his Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei having lost power to the Indo-Fijian-led Labour Party of Mahendra Chaudhry in the elections of 1999. Speight has two sons, Jordan Speight (born 1991) and another son (born 1990) with Torika Rawlinson. Speight graduated with Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Business from Michigan's Andrews University. He subsequently settled in Australia, where he worked as a sales representative for the Computer Orchard, a Brisbane-based Apple Computer dealer, and later as a branch manager for Metway Bank before returning to Fiji in 1996. He then became chairman of Fiji Pine, Ltd. and of Fiji Hardwood Corporation, Ltd.. He also became a manager of Heath Fiji, Ltd. but resigned due to shareholder personality conflicts.

It details the exploits of the hero of a number of his books, Ijon Tichy, as he visits the Eighth World Futurological Congress at a Hilton Hotel in Costa Rica.Lem sets the story in a fictional republic of Costarikana (Costa Rica is called Kostaryka in Polish). In most foreign translations, except the English one by Michael Kandel, the name is rendered as \\"Costaricana\\", thus retaining its fictional reference. The book is Lem's take on the common science fictional trope of an apparently Utopian future that turns out to be an illusion.  Overview  The book opens at the eponymous congress. A riot breaks out, and the hero, Ijon Tichy, is hit by various psychoactive drugs that were put into the drinking water supply lines by the government to pacify riots. Ijon and a few others escape to the safety of a sewer beneath the Hilton where the congress was being held, and in the sewer he goes through a series of hallucinations and false awakenings, which cause him to be confused about whether or not what's happening around him is real. Finally, he believes that he falls asleep and wakes up many years later. The main part of the book follows Ijon's adventures in the future world ‚Äî a world where everyone takes hallucinogenic drugs, and hallucinations have replaced reality. Plot summary Ijon Tichy is sent to the Eighth World Futurological Congress in Costa Rica by professor Tarantoga. The conference is set to focus on the world's overpopulation crisis and ways of dealing with it. It is held at the Costa Rica Hilton in Nounas, which is 164 stories tall. Lem is fiercely satirical from the start, and absurdities abound at the Hilton with its guaranteed \\"BOMB-FREE\\" rooms and the extravagances of Tichy's suite, which include a palm grove and an \\"all-girl orchestra [that] played Bach while performing a cleverly choreographed striptease\\". The conference itself is no less absurd. Papers and presenters are too numerous to allow for full presentations. Instead, papers are distributed in hard copy and speakers call out paragraph numbers to call attention to their most salient points. In the middle of his first night at the conference, Tichy drinks some tap water in his hotel room, and his wild hallucinogenic trip begins, though it never becomes any more or less absurd than the brief glimpse of reality Lem presents in the beginning of the book (if indeed the congress is meant to be reality). He realizes the next day that the government has drugged the public water supply with \\"benignimizers\\", a drug that makes the victim helplessly benevolent. Events spiral out of control at the Hilton, which was already so chaotic that charred corpses from bombing attacks would be covered with tarps where they lay while guests went about their business. The government ends up bombing the hotel, and Tichy escapes into the sewer, where rats walk around on their hind legs. Tichy is evacuated from the scene by the military: first he escapes by jetpack, only to realise he is hallucinating (falling in the sewer water to find he never left). After returning to reality, he is rescued again and this time evacuated by helicopter, but during his rescue the helicopter crashes, and he awakes in the hospital, where he finds that his brain has been transplanted into the body of an attractive young black woman. Protesters attack the hospital, and Tichy is nearly killed again. This time when he wakes up, he finds that he has been transplanted into the body of an overweight, red-haired man, however this too is an illusion (again, broken when Tichy falls into the sewer water). When the military once again arrive to rescue everyone in the sewer Tichy refuses to move, believing that it is another illusion. He is then found by counter-revolutionaries, who shoot him. Awaking in another hospital, Tichy's mental state grows increasingly fragile as he cannot distinguish reality from hallucination (giving the staff inane nicknames, such as \\"Hallucinathan\\" and \\"Hallucinda\\"), and the medical staff make the decision to freeze him until a time when medicine can help his condition. He awakes in the year 2039, and at this point, the novel adopts the format of a journal that Tichy keeps to chronicle his experience in this new world. His future shock is so great that he finds he is being introduced to the world in small stages by the medical staff. In most regards, this future society is Utopian. Money is no object. One can simply go to the bank and request any sum and borrow it interest-free. There is no effort made to collect the debt, either, as most people take a drug that instills a sense of pride and work-ethic, which would disallow defaulting on the debt. Tichy learns that there is an inherent bias against defrostees, and that there are a great deal of words that he does not understand. Like cityspeak, and many other sci-fi futuristic languages, it is a mishmash of words with clear enough English roots, though Tichy is mystified by it. Also, mood is highly regulated by drugs. Tichy gets involved with a woman, and during an argument, she deliberately takes a drug called recriminol to make her more combative, which prolongs the tiff. Following their break-up, Tichy becomes deeply disillusioned with the \\"psychem\\" mentality, wherein drugs regulate every waking moment of the day. He resolves to stop taking any drugs and confides to his friend, professor Trottelreiner, that he can't stand this new world. Trottelreiner explains that the everyday drugs that Tichy is tired of are only the tip of the iceberg. Narcotics and hallucinogens are trifles compared to \\"mascons\\", which are so powerful that they mask whole swaths of reality. Trottelreiner explains, \\"mascon\\" derives from mask, masquerade, mascara: \\"By introducing properly prepared mascons to the brain, one can mask any object in the outside world behind a fictitious image‚Äîsuperimposed‚Äîand with such dexterity, that the psychemasconated subject cannot tell which of his perceptions have been altered, and which have not. If but for a single instant you could see this world of ours the way it really is‚Äîundoctored, unadulterated, uncensored‚Äîyou would drop in your tracks!\\" The professor then gives Tichy a flask of \\"up'n'at'm, one of the vigilanimides, a powerful countersomniac and antipsychem agent. A derivative of dimethylethylhexabutylpeptopeyotine\\". With his first sniff of up'n'at'm, Tichy watches as the gilded surroundings of the five-star restaurant they are in evaporates into a dingy concrete bunker, and his stuffed pheasant turns into \\"the most unappetizing gray-brown gruel, which stuck in globs to my tin ‚Äî no longer silver ‚Äî fork\\". But this first dose is just the beginning of Tichy's journey. He sees that people do not drive cars or ride in elevators, but they run in the streets and climb the walls of empty elevator shafts, which explains why everyone in this new world is so out of breath. Robots whip people in the street and protect order. Through successive doses of more and more powerful types of up'n'at'm, Tichy sees increasingly horrible visions of the world, climaxing in a frozen horrorscape where people sleep blissfully in the snow, and the police robots are revealed to be people who are convinced that they are robots. The frozen state of the world explains why he has always found the new world to be so cold. In a state of panic, Tichy realizes that he is \\"no longer safely inside the illusion, but shipwrecked in reality\\", and he desperately seeks the seat of power. He ascends in a skyscraper to encounter his acquaintance George P. Symington Esquire, who sits in a modest office and explains to Tichy that he and a few others employ mascons as a way of maintaining order: :\\"The year is 2098 ... with 69 billion inhabitants legally registered and approximately another 26 billion in hiding. The average annual temperature has fallen four degrees. In fifteen or twenty years there will be glaciers here. We have no way of averting or halting their advance ‚Äî we can only keep them secret.\\" :\\"I always thought there would be ice in hell,\\" I said. Tichy realizes his only course of action and tackles Symington, pushing them both out of the window. They plummet to the earth, but instead of colliding with the frozen ground, Tichy splashes into the black, stinking waters of the sewer beneath the Costa Rica Hilton, revealing that his suspicions were right all along: the whole future world he experienced was an illusion. He realizes that it is now the second day of the Eighth World Futurological Congress. Cultural influence The film The Congress is partially based on the novel Futurological Congress. Like Ijon Tichy, the actress is split between delusional and real mental states.Ari Folman on the Genius of Stanislaw Lem ‚Äì interview (March 2011) The title of the book was used for one episode of the German TV show Ijon Tichy: Raumpilot, which itself was rather based on the story \\"The Eighth Voyage\\" from Lem's The Star Diaries.

At times, a stripper may be hired to perform at a bachelor party or other private event. Modern Americanized forms of stripping minimize interaction by strippers with customers, reducing the importance of tease in the performance in favor of speed to undress (strip). Details. Not every stripper will end a performance completely nude, though full nudity is common where not prohibited by law. The integration of the burlesque pole as a nearly ubiquitous prop has shifted the emphasis in the performance toward a more acrobatic, explicit expression compared to the slow-developing burlesque style. Most strippers work in strip clubs. A \\"house dancer\\" works for a particular club or franchise, while a \\"feature dancer\\" tends to have her own celebrity, touring a club circuit making appearances. Entertainers (dancers) are often not actual employees of the club itself but perform as independent contractors. Until the 1970s, strippers in Western cultures were almost invariably female, performing to male audiences. Since then, male strippers have also become common, but strippers are still overwhelmingly female. Certain male and female strippers also perform for LGBT audiences as well as for both sexes in bisexual contexts. Before the 1970s, dancers of both sexes appeared largely in underground clubs or as part of a theatre experience, but the practice eventually became common enough on its own. Performances are usually fully choreographed, involve dance routines and a costume of some sort. The term \\"male stripper\\" has gone down in use in books in the 21st century. Work environment Strippers perform striptease for a number of reasons, predominantly to make money. The physical attractiveness and sex appeal of the dancer determines the business the stripper tends to generate. There are no job prerequisites; formal training is minimal, primarily on the job and provided by more senior dancers. Dancers learn a set of rules, such as: never leave money unattended; never leave the club with a customer; and never refuse a table dance. As long as she can \\"sell\\" herself, she is capable of becoming an exotic dancer. PDF. The image of strippers as known today evolved through the late 1960s and 1970s in the U.S. and international cultures. By the 1980s, the pole dancing and highly-explicit imagery associated with today's performers was widely accepted and frequently portrayed in film, television, and theater. In a bikini performance, both breasts and genital areas typically remain covered by revealing attire while dancers provide services and entertainment. Go-go dancers will retain their tops and bottoms for the duration of their performance. A stripper whose upper body is exposed but the genital areas remain obscured during a performance is said to be topless. Touching of strippers is not permitted in many localities. However, some dancers and clubs allow touching of dancers during private dances. If permitted, during a lap dance the dancer may dance sitting in the customers lap, clothed or topless. In parts of the USA, there are laws forbidding the exposure of female nipples, which have to be covered by pasties by the dancer. Due to the common practice of hiring strippers as contractors, not as full- time employees, strippers must deal with extreme job insecurity, unstable pay, no health benefits, and the requirement of paying fees to the club for technically renting their stage. This precarious employment is accepted because of the stigma associated with exotic dancing. Dancers use props such as make-up, clothing, costumes, and appealing fragrances to complete their character and maintain their \\"front\\". =Inside the club= Strippers, when working, are most likely to be found at strip clubs. An essential draw of the strip club is the live entertainment, which the vast majority of the time are the strippers. Dancers effectively entertaining customers are the key to generating revenue by keeping the customers on site and enticing them to be repeat visitors. House dancers work for a particular club or franchise. Feature dancers tend to have their own celebrity, touring a club circuit and making appearances. Porn stars will often become feature dancers to earn extra income and build their fan base. High-profile adult film performers Jenna Haze and Teagan Presley among others have participated in feature shows through the USA, as did now-retired stars such as Jenna Jameson. Entertainers (dancers) are often not actual employees of the club itself but allowed to perform as independent contractors for a predetermined house fee. During each set of one or more songs, the current performer will dance on stage in exchange for tips. Where legal (or legal restrictions are ignored), dancers may offer additional services such as lap dances or a trip to the champagne room for a set fee rather than a tip. Strippers can be contracted for performances outside the strip club environment. Some strippers will only strip for private engagements and do not have a regular affiliation with a strip club. Much like activities inside the club, different dancers have different comfort levels for services they will provide during a private party. Aside from advertising for striptease services outside the club, an unknown percentage of strippers also work in other aspects of the sex industry. This can include erotic and nude modeling, pornography, escorting, and in some cases prostitution. Outside the U.S., the use of strip clubs to facilitate sex for hire is much more common, and stripping is viewed in those settings as advertising for sexually oriented services performed in private areas of the club or off premises. Stage performance Most clubs have a dancer rotation where each dancer in turn will perform for one or more songs in a fixed sequence which repeats during a shift. More informal clubs will have dancers take turns when a stage becomes empty or have a free flow of entertainers where the stage has any number of entertainers who wander off and on at will. Feature entertainers are not usually part of the rotation, and have set times where they will perform that are advertised throughout the shift. If a DJ is present, they will emcee the rotation and typically announce the current dancer(s) on stage and possibly whom to expect in future sets. Tip collection During each set of one or more songs, the current performer will dance on stage in exchange for tips. Dancers collect tips from customers either while on stage or after the dancer has finished a stage show and is mingling with the audience. A customary tip (where customers can do so at the stage) is a dollar bill folded lengthwise and placed in the dancer's garter from the tip rail. Other common tip methods are to insert the dollar into the stripper's cleavage from the hand or mouth, or to simply place it or toss it onto the stage. Tipping during a stage performance is prohibited by some clubs due to restrictions in local ordinance or past incidents on the premises. Each club and dancer will have individual tolerance levels for customer interaction including tipping. Some clubs will have multiple stages on the premises that dancers will move between, but typically the dancer would collect for her time on the main stage during a rotation. Tips can also be collected during private dances. Private dance Where legal (or legal restrictions are ignored), dancers may offer additional services such as lap dances or a trip to the champagne room for a set fee rather than a tip. This fee will typically include a set fee for the room, for a set amount of time. Private dances in the main club areas most often take the form of table dances, lap and couch dances, and bed dances among others. An air dance is a particular form of private dance where little to no contact between the dancer and customer occurs. This class of dance spans the different categories above, and some dancers can perform air dances when more contact-heavy forms of dance were expected and paid for. Table dances are distinguished from other forms of dances in that they can be performed where the customer is seated on the main floor. Table dances also refer to a form of minimal touch private dance where the performer is physically located on a small table in front of the customer(s). Table dances should not be confused with table stages, where the stripper is at or above eye level on a platform surrounded by chairs and usually enough table surface for customers to place drinks and tip money. These stages are configured for close viewing of the striptease and are known for dancers lowering themselves from the stage onto customers during their set. Lap dances can be (and are) performed in all manner of seating, ranging from plain stools and kitchen- grade chairs to plush leather armchairs. They can also be performed with the customer standing in these designated areas. A service provided by many clubs is for a customer to be placed on stage with one or more dancers for a public lap dance. Occasions for this type of performance are bachelor parties and birthdays in the club among others. Bed dances are designed for the customer to be lying down with the entertainer(s) positioned on top of them. Bed dances are the least common of the three, and in many clubs, these are a more expensive option than a lap dance because of the novelty and increased level of contact between customer and service provider. A champagne room (also called a champagne lounge or champagne court) is a specialized VIP Room service offered by gentleman's clubs where a customer can purchase time (usually in half-hour increments) with an exotic dancer in a private room on the premises. Depending on the quality of the club, the room, which is away from the hustle and bustle of the main club, is well decorated and usually has its own bar. Clubs sell champagne by the glass or by the bottle for both the dancer and the customer. =Outside the club= Strippers can be contracted for performances outside the strip club environment. Some strippers will only strip for private engagements and do not have a regular affiliation with a strip club. Bachelor and bachelorette parties A bachelor party may involve activities beyond the usual party and social-gathering ingredients (often drinking alcohol and gambling), such as going to a strip club or hiring a stripper to perform in a private setting like a home or hotel. In some traditions, more hazing-like tests and pranks at the future groom's expense, which shows the whole thing is also a rite of passage from bachelorhood (associated with an adolescent lifestyle, often in the common past of most participants, e.g., in their student years) to \\"more responsible\\" marital life. These pranks can involve a stripper if the entertainer is willing. Bachelor parties have come to symbolize the last time when the groom is free of the influence of his new wife. Some women also participate in a similar party to be held for the bride-to-be. This is known as a bachelorette party or Hen party. Some also chose instead to hold a so-called Stag and Doe party in the US or a hag party or hag do in the UK (\\"hag\\" being a portmanteau \\"hen\\" and \\"stag\\"), in which both the bride and groom attend. The female equivalent of a stag party in Canada is often known as a \\"stagette\\", \\"doe\\", or \\"bachelorette\\". Private parties Private parties are popular events for which to hire strippers. There are many entertainment businesses that have strippers contracted for private performances. Some of these companies have a national presence, with strippers contracted in multiple states and some who work regionally over a multi-state area. Strippers will also do side work and handle their own agreements and payment arrangements. Written agreements are atypical in this type of transaction unless a formal, registered business is involved. They could also travel over significant (i.e. flight required) distances for private events and appointments, most of the time passing the cost of travel and accommodations onto the customer. Patrons at the clubs in which the strippers work are a primary source of customers for their work outside the club. Much like activities inside the club, different dancers have different comfort levels for services they will provide during a private party. Other activities Aside from advertising for striptease services outside the club, an unknown percentage of strippers also work in other aspects of the sex industry. This can include erotic and nude modeling, pornography, escorting, and in some cases prostitution (which is now illegal in all states other than Nevada within the U.S.). These activities are not mutually exclusive, meaning that a stripper who models on the side would be a stripper and a model. Adult industry trade shows often have strippers working, though many of them are affiliated with individual companies and not necessarily freelancers. More traditional industries have made use of go-go dancers to provide entertainment and act as bargirls or hostesses. The lack of explicit nudity makes go-go dancers more socially acceptable than topless and nude performers in public areas. There are also exhibitions, festivals, and competitions where independent strippers are more likely to be performing. Nudes-A-Poppin' is a popular festival scheduled annually which features both female and male dancers competing in erotic dance. Outside the U.S., the use of strip clubs to facilitate sex for hire is much more common, and stripping is viewed in those settings as advertising for sexually oriented services performed in private areas of the club or off premises. Performance While working, a stripper is not necessarily required to remove all of her or his clothing. Regardless of size, name, or location in the world, strip clubs can be full nude, topless or bikini. For any type of strip club there are exceptions based on the individual dancer and management, and clubs are classified based on typical performances, zoning, and advertised services. =Style of dress= In some localities, strippers are required to obtain permits to work in adult entertainment. During a bikini performance, both breasts and genital areas typically remain covered by revealing attire, while dancers provide services and entertainment. Go-go dancers will retain their tops and bottoms for the duration of their performance. A female stripper whose upper body is exposed, but whose genital areas remain obscured during a performance, is said to be topless. Strippers who uncover the genital areas along with other clothing during a performance are said to be dancing fully nude. The fully nude practice is banned in many jurisdictions, but many dancers work around these constraints by selective uncovering of the vulva, anus, or both, for short periods of time, followed by immediate replacement of the clothing. Details. Not all strippers are comfortable dancing topless or fully nude. Details. Bikini (Go-Go) In a bikini performance, both breasts and genital areas typically remain covered by revealing attire while providing services and entertainment. Go-go dancers will retain their tops and bottoms for the duration of their performance. What differentiates a bikini dancer from other types of performers is the degree to which her body is exposed. The stripper, in the case of a bikini performance, may begin with layers of clothing worn over the bikini which then would be removed during the course of the dance set. When a bikini performance is being performed, many dancers will forgo a garter because they can accept tips at various points in their outfit (typically at the waist or hip or over their ribcage). A bikini performance is far more likely to be performed by a female than a male given social norms throughout the world. It has been debated whether or not bikini clubs and performances should count as striptease, but there is little contention over its classification as exotic dance. The phrase Go-Go was adopted by bars in the 1960s in Tokyo, Japan. It was of lesser reputation until it was appropriated by American burlesque and striptease establishments, which in turn became known as go-go bars and the women working there known as Go-Go dancers. In many clubs, while a stripper is walking the floor she will be required to wear her full bikini top and bottom. When a stripper performs personal services (such as lap or bed dances) where she comes into contact with a customer, she would also be required to remain in her bikini in more restrictive club environments. Private dances in particular are scrutinized to ensure that no club policies or local ordinances are being violated during the performance. The additional clothing also acts as a deterrent to prevent a customer from exceeding the boundaries set by a particular dancer. On 19 June 1964, Carol Doda began go-go dancing topless at the Condor Club on Broadway and Columbus in the North Beach neighborhood of San Francisco. She became the world's most famous go-go dancer, and a prototype for the modern stripper, while dancing at the Condor for 22 years. Details. Topless Women are at times employed in adult-only venues to perform or pose topless in forms of commercial erotic entertainment. Such venues can range from downmarket strip clubs to upmarket cabarets, such as the Moulin Rouge. A stripper whose upper body is exposed but the genital areas remain obscured during a performance is said to be topless. Topless entertainment may also include competitions such as wet T-shirt contests in which women display their breasts through translucent wet fabric‚Äîand may end up removing their T-shirts before the audience. Strippers can engage in these alternate topless activities at sanctioned times inside the club or as independent contractors at outside venues. Not all strippers are comfortable dancing topless. In areas where choice in formats exist, exotic dancers express concern that the more they offer in their performance (nudity included) the more they stand to profit. Even the dancers that will go topless have been known to stay covered during a dance during slow periods in the club with few customers. This is particularly true if the customers do not appear to be engaged or actively tipping because they are not being compensated for their time on stage. The practice of topless dancing is banned in many jurisdictions, but strippers have been known to work around the constraints by selectively uncovering her breasts \\"peek-a- boo\\" style for short periods of time then replacing the clothing. For a male dancer, a bare chest is not considered in the same light and does not face the same legal restrictions. During a show where customer tipping is permitted, most strip clubs limit contact with a dancer's breasts to one way‚Äîfrom dancer to customer. Many clubs do not allow any breast contact, and some go so far as to place markers on stage that a dancer is not permitted to cross while nude. This physical separation enforces compliance with the no-touch policy. Full nudity thumb267pxHistorical marker at the original Condor Club site. Full text: \\"The Condor; Where it all began; The birthplace of the world's first topless & bottomless entertainment; Topless ‚Äì June 19, 1964 Bottomless ‚Äì September 3, 1969 Starring Ms. Carol Doda; San Francisco, California\\" Strippers who uncover the genital areas along with other clothing during a performance are said to be dancing fully nude. The practice is banned in many jurisdictions, but many dancers will work around the constraints by selectively uncovering her vulva, anus, or both for short periods of time then replacing the clothing. For a male dancer, exposing the penis or anus is equivalent. Many dancers prefer to leave their clothing on their bodies once they have shifted them from their private areas. In some cases this disguises blemishes or areas of their figure they are not comfortable with, or could simply be to prevent those parts of the outfit from being misplaced. Not all strippers are comfortable dancing fully nude. If viewed as a continuum, fewer dancers will dance topless than go-go and fewer still would dance fully nude. It has been reported when in direct competition with more conservative offerings, fully nude formats are seen by customers as a superior enough substitute for them to switch clubs. In areas where choice in formats exist, exotic dancers express concern that the more they offer in their performance (nudity included) the more they stand to profit. Still, strippers have been known to dance only at topless clubs because of their desire not to strip completely nude. Some clubs permit both nude stage dancing and fully nude lap dances. Where nude private dances are allowed with contact, some dancers choose to place some type of barrier (cloth or occasionally plastic) over the customer's lap as a precautionary measure. =Customer interaction= Strippers are focused on making money from customers. How dancers go about maximizing revenue varies. For customers they do not already know, dancers use factors such as clothing, shoes, age, and race to determine whom they wish to interact with. Dancers and owners are always in agreement on the objective of making money. Strip clubs are profit-oriented businesses like restaurants and other retail establishments and dancers are their primary enabler to encourage potential patrons to spend time in their establishment. The dancers continually interact with the customers in the club by walking around and attempting to solicit drinks and lap dances, usually scanning the floor of a club to find the most lucrative customer to target. While clubs can generate revenue through means such as cover charges and drink fees, dancers make most of their profit from giving lap dances or VIP dances where regulations allow. Otherwise, customer tips to dancers from a stage set are their primary form of payment per shift. The dancer qualifies a customer by sizing up their appearance and personal characteristics. Once the dancer identifies her mark, she approaches and attempts to create a false social relationship with her customer using tactical interactions and manipulations toward a result of monetary gain. Customers can make the first move and engage the dancer directly, but more experienced dancers will have seen most of their tactics already. Strippers appeal to masculine desires, but they can adapt to fit the needs of female patrons to view them as customers. Adapting the experience to the customer is an integral part of exotic dancing. =Mainstreaming= In the 21st century, as adult themes and work are becoming more commonplace, more of the population is attracted to this type of work. For example, a University of Leeds study, published by the British Journal of Sociology of Education, revealed that as many as one third of \\"strip club dancers are students, with many using the cash earned to support themselves throughout their studies\\" and likely to come from middle class backgrounds. The study also stated that \\"students were now a 'core supply group into the sex industries', with clubs even targeting freshers' week events with recruitment leaflets.\\" This is supported by a 2014 story in the New York Daily News regarding San Francisco strip clubs taking out recruitment ads in the university newspaper for the University of California at Berkeley, The Daily Californian. One distinction made is that many view working as a strip club dancer as a short-term means to address financial needs, while others view it as a profession and go on to other types of sex work such as performing in adult films. =Gender roles= Male strippers A male stripper in 2009 Until the 1970s, strippers in Western cultures were almost invariably female, performing to male audiences. Male and female strippers also perform for gay and lesbian audiences respectively, as well as for both sexes in pansexual contexts. The modern male stripper show usually involves full nudity, although sometimes they may retain underwear, especially g-strings, bikini briefs or thongs throughout the show, or only remove all clothing for a brief time. Performances are usually fully choreographed, involve dance routines and a costume of some sort. Prominent male strip groups include the Dreamboys in the UK & Chippendales in the US. A male stripper will likely perform at club, bar, workplace or private home with private advanced bookings or ladies nights being prevalent over strip clubs which is the norm for female strippers. This is different from the Chippendales scene that emerged to prominence in the 1980s with today's norm being one sole performer, or a series of individual performers rather than a group of strippers. Tewksbury argues that male strippers 'masculinise' the role; thus are not disempowered in the way that, he asserts, female strippers are. Sexuality and gender bias Ethnographic research has observed that strippers, regardless of sexual preference, have a tendency to treat female customers differently than males. Because of the non-physical motivations ascribed to female intimacy, dancers select women to approach who are smiling and sitting comfortably with open body language such as uncrossed arms, actively participating with the crowd, laughing and engaging with fellow customers, and applauding for dancers at the main stage also increase the likelihood they will be approached. Dancers tend to avoid women with unfriendly facial expressions or visibly hostile body language, again regardless of sexual orientation. In order to become approached, men must indicate financial potential through their appearance. Women must demonstrate their good attitude and willingness to participate in club activities. At that point, a woman's perceived profitability is also a factor in a dancer's decision to approach a female patron. The presence of male companionship has been cited in research as an indicator used by dancers to gauge the profitability of a female once she is perceived to be a customer. =In popular culture= The image of strippers as known today evolved through the late 1960s and 1970s in the U.S. and international cultures which embraced Americanized striptease, introduced into popular culture by the genre-defining performances of Carol Doda at the Condor Club in San Francisco, California. Film, television, and theater By the 1980s, Americans began to love the pole-dancing and highly sexual imagery associated with today's performers was widely accepted and frequently portrayed in film, television, and theater. =1980s‚Äì1990s= In addition to lesser-known videos, the 1980s also featured mainstream films involving strippers and their work as part of the central narrative. These included Flashdance (1983), which told the story of blue-collar worker Alexandra \\"Alex\\" Owens (Jennifer Beals), who works as an exotic dancer in a Pittsburgh bar at night and at a steel mill as a welder during the day. Blaze (1989) features Lolita Davidovitch as notorious stripper Blaze Starr. Starr herself appears in the film in a cameo role. Exotica (1994), directed by Atom Egoyan, is set in a Canadian lap-dance club, and portrays a man's (Bruce Greenwood) obsession with a schoolgirl stripper named Christina (Mia Kirshner). Showgirls (1995) was directed by Paul Verhoeven and starred Elizabeth Berkley and Gina Gershon. Striptease (1996), was an adaptation of the novel starring Demi Moore. The Players Club (1998) starred LisaRaye McCoy as a girl who becomes a stripper to earn enough money to enter college and study journalism. In Jekyll and Hyde (1997), the character of Lucy Harris (originally portrayed by Linda Eder) works as a prostitute and stripper in a small London club called The Red Rat, where she meets a multi-dimension man named Doctor Henry Jekyll, who turns into his evil persona Mr. Edward Hyde. Lucy performs the song \\"Bring on the Men\\" during a show at The Red Rat (which was later replaced with \\"Good 'n' Evil\\" in the Broadway production, some claiming \\"Bring on the Men\\" was too \\"risqu√©\\"). In Neighbours (1985), the character of Daphne is originally a stripper at Des's bucks party, and eventually goes on to marry him. Married... with Children (1987‚Äì97) often featured Al Bundy, Jefferson D'Arcy, and the NO MA'AM crew spending a night at the Nudie Bar. In The Sopranos (1999‚Äì2007) business was often conducted at the Bada Bing strip club. =2000s‚Äìpresent= Dancing at the Blue Iguana (2000) is a feature film starring Sandra Oh and Daryl Hannah. The female cast of the film researched the film by dancing at strip clubs and created their parts and their storylines to be as realistic as possible. Stripsearch (2001‚Äì), an ongoing Australian reality television show which centers around the training of male strippers. The Hot Chick (2002) stars Rachel McAdams, in her film debut, as a high school cheerleader who, after switching bodies with a small time criminal (Rob Schneider), starts working at a strip club called Pole Cat. The Raymond Revuebar: The Art of Striptease (2002) is a documentary, directed by Simon Weitzman. Los Debutantes (2003) is a Chilean film set in a strip club in Santiago. In Closer (2004), Natalie Portman plays Alice, a young stripper who arrives in London from America. Portman won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress ‚Äì Motion Picture for her performance. Rob Zombie's 2007 Halloween remake features Michael Myers' mother Deborah (played by Zombie's wife Sheri Moon Zombie), dancing to \\"Love Hurts\\" by Nazareth. I Know Who Killed Me (2007) stars Lindsay Lohan as Dakota Moss, an alluring stripper involved in the machinations of a serial killer, and features a long striptease sequence at a strip club. In Planet Terror (2007), Rose McGowan plays go-go dancer Cherry Darling who, after having her leg eaten by a zombie, uses an assault rifle as a prosthetic leg. In the two-part season 6 finale of Degrassi: The Next Generation, Alex Nunez resorts to stripping after she and her mother do not have enough money to pay the rent on their apartment. Darren Aronofsky's 2008 drama film The Wrestler features Marisa Tomei playing a stripper and single mother who is romantically pursued by professional wrestler Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson (Mickey Rourke).

Music and spoken word Strippers have been the inspiration for a number of musical artists, with several of the songs resulting in hit singles. An instrumental, \\"The Stripper\\", was a No. 1 hit on the U.S. pop singles charts for David Rose and His Orchestra in 1962. That song pre-dated the opening of what is considered to be the first modern strip club, Condor Club on Broadway in the U.S. city of San Francisco, California. \\"Private Dancer\\" by Tina Turner was an international hit and her second highest charting single reaching No. 7 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. \\"Girls, Girls, Girls\\" by M√∂tley Cr√ºe was also a Top 20 hit on the U.S. charts. T-Pain had a No. 5 hit on the Billboard chats with \\"I'm 'n Luv (Wit a Stripper)\\" in 2006. Hip hop artist Flo Rida had two No. 1 hits in the U.S. in the 2000s with \\"Right Round\\" and \\"Low\\". For both hip-hop artists, the depictions of strippers and expressions of lust are far more explicit than in songs released in earlier music eras. This is not limited to hip-hop, with contemporary songs in other styles of music sharing similar traits. \\"Worked Up So Sexual\\" by The Faint is graphic in its depiction of dancer rivalry (older dancers gag at what new talent seems to mean, smaller tits and younger limbs) and customers longing to bed them. Public acceptance of the music has not faltered, and many dancers perform to these and other songs depicting women in subjectively negative ways while on stage. Video games Duke Nukem 3D, released in 1996, became the original pioneer video game for the inclusion of strippers. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (2004) was the first video game of the saga to include strippers. Grand Theft Auto IV (2008) includes a strip club where the player can mingle with the strippers. In Grand Theft Auto V (2013) the character can visit Vanila Unicorn and takes lap dances with the strippers. In the online version, the player can flirt with the stripper by using their voice on the microphone. Legal issues From ancient times to the present day, striptease has been considered a form of public nudity and subject to legal and cultural prohibitions on moral and decency grounds. =Laws and court cases= Many U.S. jurisdictions have specific laws on the books related to striptease, with more being added increasing both complexity of enforcement and impact. For example, the classification of dancers as independent contractors has been challenged in court, successfully in Massachusetts in 2009. One of the more notorious local ordinances is San Diego Municipal Code 33.3610, specific and strict in response to allegations of corruption among local officials which included contacts in the nude entertainment industry. Among its provisions is the \\"six foot rule\\", copied by other municipalities in requiring that dancers maintain a six-foot distance while performing. Touching of performers is illegal in many U.S. states. However, some dancers and some clubs condone touching of dancers during private dances. This touching often includes the fondling of breasts, buttocks, and in rare cases the vaginal region. In some locales, dancers may give a customer a \\"lap dance\\", whereby the dancer grinds against the customer's crotch while they are fully clothed in an attempt to arouse them or bring them to climax. Other rules forbid \\"full nudity\\". In some parts of the USA, there are laws forbidding the exposure of female nipples, which have thus to be covered by pasties by the dancer (though not applied to the exposure of male nipples). In early 2010, the U.S. city of Detroit, Michigan banned fully exposed breasts in its strip clubs, following the example of Houston, Texas who began enforcing a similar ordinance in 2008. The Detroit city council has since softened the rules eliminating the requirement for pasties but kept other restrictions. Both municipalities were reputed to have rampant occurrences of illicit activity including prostitution linked to its striptease establishments within their city limits. In Britain in the 1930s, when the Windmill Theatre, London, began to present nude shows, British law prohibited performers moving whilst in a state of nudity. To get around that rule, models appeared naked in stationary tableaux vivants. To keep within the law, sometimes devices were used which rotated the models without them moving themselves. Fan dances were another device used to keep performances within the law. These allowed a naked dancer's body to be concealed by her fans or those of her attendants, until the end of an act, when she posed naked for a brief interval whilst standing stock still, and the lights went out or the curtain dropped to allow her to leave the stage. In 2010, Iceland outlawed striptease. Johanna Sigur√∞ardottir, Iceland's prime minister, said: \\"The Nordic countries are leading the way on women's equality, recognizing women as equal citizens rather than commodities for sale.\\" The politician behind the bill, Kolbr√∫n Halld√≥rsd√≥ttir, said: \\"It is not acceptable that women or people in general are a product to be sold.\\" =Collective bargaining= As the sex industry has grown and become a more established sector of national economies, sex workers‚Äîstrippers included‚Äîhave mobilized to negotiate or demand workplace rights. One means of collectivization pursued by strippers is the formation of labor unions, which involves formal membership. These strippers' unions have tended to focus on economic and workers' rights rather than civil rights, which constitutes a significant departure from the advocacy groups for prostitutes' rights that began in the 1970s and 1980s. PDF The stigma attached to sex work also creates another obstacle to organization because many strippers and other types of sex workers are uncomfortable with declaring their profession publicly, even in a movement to improve their work environment and benefits. One potential critique of the organization of strippers and sex workers of other types is that people in management positions in these industries, who are in a position to perpetuate the exploitation that sex workers face, can infiltrate these labor organizations and lobby for the maintenance of a status quo. Australia The Striptease Artists of Australia formed in 2002. The SAA successfully negotiated an industrial award with the AIRC in 2006. Despite this establishment of an industry-wide minimum standard for labor rights, changes to employment legislature under a Conservative government enabled employers to utilize loopholes such as employing strippers as sub-contractors. Another group, the Scarlet Alliance has been involved in advocacy and projects geared towards improving the standing of sex workers since its inception in 1989. While labor rights are an important part of this group's agenda, it is not a labor union. Britain The International Union of Sex Workers is a branch of the GMB, a major general union in Great Britain. Canada In the 1980s, the Vancouver Exotic Dancers Alliance formed and was active for about a decade. The Canadian Guild for Erotic Labour was established in 2004. United States The Lusty Lady of San Francisco is a notable example of collectivization of strippers in the U.S. When the strippers of the establishment successfully unionized in 1996 through the Erotic Dancers' Alliance, the owners of the club closed it. In response, the strippers formed a cooperative in 2003 to run the club themselves, now renamed the Looking Glass Collective.
