Directed by Douglas McGrath, the film stars Sarah Jessica Parker, Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear. It was released on September 16, 2011 and grossed $31 million against its $24 million budget.  Plot  Back from a business trip, Kate (Sarah Jessica Parker), receives a reminder from her daughter, Emily's (Emma Rayne Lyle) kindergarten bake sale for the next day. Didn‚Äôt want her daughter to feel different from other children, Kate wanted to bake something homemade, but the deli shop near her was out of baking supplies. Kate bought a store-baked pie and a glass pie holder and went home to distress it to make it more homemade like. Back home, she is greeted by her husband, Richard (Greg Kinnear). Kate and Richard attempted to have sex that night, but she fell asleep due to exhaustion. In the middle of the night, Kate went up to check on her children as she couldn‚Äôt sleep. She started making a mental list of tasks as she usually does which results in her insomnia. The next morning, she was greeted with a huge hug and laughter by her 2-year-old son, Ben (Theodore and Julius Goldberg). Unlike her daughter who is slightly older, who tends to display her dissatisfaction with Kate‚Äôs travelling and busy schedule. Whilst making breakfast, Kate notices Richard is well-dressed and realizes he is going to an important meeting. Kate pleads for Richard to stay put for 5 more minutes as she heads to bathe as the baby sitter, Paula, isn‚Äôt here to take over (Jessica Szohr). Richard is going to talk to Paula about her tardiness but is stopped by Kate, to ensure Paula‚Äôs willingness to stay put with the Reddy‚Äôs family. As per usual, Kate and Emily are once late again for circle time, much to the dismay of the teacher. Afterwards, Kate meets her good friend, Allison (Christina Hendricks), a single mother working as a lawyer who brings a tub of un-set JELL-O for the bake sale. They later encounter ‚Äúthe Momsters‚Äù ‚Äì Wendy Best (Busy Philipps) and Janine LoPietro (Sarah Shahi), who are the typical fit and highly involved stay-at-home mothers. The foursome have a rather awkward conversation, noting the fact that the 2 groups of women had nothing in common other than the fact that they are mothers of children going to the same school. At work, Kate‚Äôs boss, Clark Cooper (Kelsey Grammer) assigns a new project with Jack Abelhammer (Pierce Brosnan) to Kate rather than Bunce (Seth Meyers)‚Äì the ‚ÄúDOA‚Äù (Designated Office Asshole) who scores more project as he entertains clients with dance shows and drinks unlike Kate. After the meeting, Bunce tries to parent guilt Kate into dropping the project. The night before her meeting in NYC with Jack, Kates accidentally sends a sexually charged IM to Jack that is meant to be a joke for Allison. In the morning as Kate leaves her house with her children calling out to her, she cries from guilt towards her children. Later, Kate arrives at NYC and meets Jack with Momo (Olivia Munn) her junior research analyst who is opposed to Kate‚Äôs lifestyle and is highly career- driven. Kate apologizes to Jack for the IM and later on found out she has lice. Throughout the meeting with Jack, Kate scratches her head profusely but manages to conclude the meeting favorably. Before Emily‚Äôs 6th birthday celebration commences Kate, who has already accepted the project with Jack, hesitates in telling Richard about the good news given what it entails, and that Richard too has also successfully gotten a major project. Right before Richard opens the door to guests, Kate decides she could not hold it in anymore and blurts out with Richard standing emotionlessly at the front door. During the party, Richard‚Äôs mother, Marla (Jane Curtin) displays dismay with how both Kate and Richard are working and hopes that Kate could spend more time with the children. After the party, Kate reassures Richard that they would make it work, that nothing will fall through the cracks. Weeks past as Kate travels between Boston and NYC, seemingly perfectly juggling her personal life and her major project with Jack. After spending more time together, Kate is apparently impressed by Jack‚Äôs character, noting that he is vastly different from Bunce. Jack on the other hand, begins to grow admiration for Kate. During a dinner between Kate and Jack, Jack reveals that he was married once to someone he loved who fell sick and passed away. Leaving him leading a simpler life of being career-focused. Kate then revealed she wished to be considered as ‚ÄúBill‚Äù a guy rather than a working mother in the eyes of Jack. Jack sends Kate home by getting her a cab, kissed her cheek, leaving Kate dumbfounded for response. After that night, Kate becomes more conscious in her contacts with Jack to maintain professional while Jack signs off \\"XO\\" in his. After a team meeting in Boston, Momo revealed to Kate that she is pregnant and is dealing with it, alludes to an abortion. Kate tries to convince Momo that she too can achieve the best of both worlds. In the middle of her sentence, she freaks out realizing she is late in taking over Richard back home. She rushes home while calling Richard to apologize for being late as she already knew he has an important dinner. Finally, Kate reaches home to an unfamiliar face ‚Äì a new baby sitter who fell asleep while tending to the children. That night, Kate and Richard had a fight over the new baby sitter, who was unfamiliar to the family. After a meeting with Jack in Cleveland, Kate and Jack head to dinner and discuss that how despite travelling a lot, they spend most of their time in hotels and airports. Rather than enjoying the famous spots the places have to offer. Recalling a past conversation, Jack brings Kate to a bowling alley. Kate was impressed that a man like Jack turns out to be an excellent bowler. Back at the hotel as they are to part, Jack states he has more fun that night bowling with Kate than with his buddies in college. Recounting the memories with Jack, Kate reassures Allison that there is nothing between them, that they‚Äôre platonic friends. Allison of course is not buying that and joked about Kate is only allowed to cheat if she tells her everything. Before thanksgiving weekend, Kate informs Momo that she will be taking 5 days off from work to spend more time with her family at Atlanta. Momo reveals to Kate that she is planning to keep the baby much to Kate‚Äôs excitement. Later, Bunce taunts Kate for taking time off work and that he is ready to takeover from her anytime. Kate notes that Bunce is the kind of guy who will sweep in at the last minute to take credit for something that someone else has worked hard for. While in Atlanta, Kate as a gesture to Richard, decides to silence her phone and be fully present during the week with the family. All is going well as Kate prepares thanksgiving dinner for the family. Until after dinner, Kate can‚Äôt help but notices that her phone has been lighting up intensively but decides to ignore it due to her gesture to Richard and the family. That is until Momo finally call through to her about a work emergency. Kate rushes to her phone with Richard looking displease. Turns out, the pitch with Jack must take place the next day due to some scheduling conflict. Jack was willing to let Bunce takeover if Kate couldn‚Äôt make it. Richard who is annoyed wants Kate to stay. However, Kate is unwilling to let Bunce take the credit for the work she has done. Before Kate leaves, Ben finally spoke his first words, ‚ÄúBye Bye, Mama‚Äù. Everyone is thrilled while Marla notices the irony of it. Before the pitch, Momo experiences morning sickness and her conditions worsen with her falling asleep mid-presentation and projecting her baby‚Äôs ultrasound during the presentation. Momo apologizes to Kate and hope that she didn‚Äôt screw things up for her. Despite her initial worries, Kate is reassured by Jack that the pitch went well. Jack informs Kate that he will be having lunch with the investor and seems to have no intention of calling Kate along. Momo is angry that Jack didn‚Äôt account for Kate which is unfair as the project is very much both of theirs. Kate tries to play down the situation to Momo. However, much to both of their surprise, Jack returns and invites Kate to lunch since they are a team. The lunch with the investor went extremely well, but Jack later realizes he had tons of miss calls from Kate. The miss calls are from Richard, who couldn‚Äôt get in touch with Kate. He calls to inform Kate that Ben has fallen down the stairs and hits his head. Kate rushes back to join them in the hospital, after which Kate and Richard had a fight over what has happened. They conclude the fight with Richard stating that they don‚Äôt spend time together anymore. That night, Kate once again couldn‚Äôt sleep and decides to pull herself up together and stop making lists ‚Äì to be more spontaneous and stop planning for everything. The next morning, to comfort Emily, Kate promises to build a snowman with the family during the next snow. At work, Kate receives a phone call from Jack who flew from NYC to Boston for Kate with the good news that their project was funded that their fund is finally on a pilot program. He then confesses his romantic feelings for her. Kate appreciates his feelings for her but states that she is very much in love with Richard and only wants to be with him. Suddenly, it begins to snow. Recalling her promise to her daughter, Kate bid Jack farewell and rushes off to Emily‚Äôs kindergarten. Emily asks Richard if Kate will show up to fulfill her promise. However, Richard being dejected blatantly replied that she is working, implying she won‚Äôt. Kate finally shows up, looking around anxiously for Richard and the kids. Once their eyes meet, Kate and Richard walk to each other and Kate apologizes for prioritizing work. Realizing that family is much more important, that she has officially cut down her time on work and will not be disappointing her family anymore. Richard then in his way apologizes to Kate by bringing out a notepad with the actual list of tasks to do, implying that he will be taking on more responsibility and share the burden with Kate. At the top of his list, is to prioritize and work on his relationship with Kate. ‚ÄúThe Momsters‚Äù then appeared, with Kate proudly exclaiming that she indeed brought store-made pie to the bake sale. Afterwards, Kate and Richard hug and kiss as they hurried off to their children to build a snowman with them. Months later, Momo gives birth to a baby boy. Ben turns 3, Kate and Richard look happier than ever. Kate introduces Allison to Jack and that relationship seems to be going well.

Holmes is most famously known for being an Executive Producer for 343 Industries, studio responsible for blockbuster franchises based in Kirkland, Washington, the Microsoft Studios unit formed to coordinate the Halo franchise. Holmes left 343 in 2016 to pursue a career in indie game development. Biography=Early career= Holmes was born and grew up in British Columbia and attended Kitsilano Secondary School in Vancouver. Josh turned to game design after several years pursuing a career as a film actor in Los Angeles, including filming a television pilot. =EA Canada= Holmes got his start in the video-game business in 1995 at Electronic Arts‚Äô campus in Burnaby, Canada as a game tester, and a year later he was hired to make games. While there, he created the Def Jam series of fighting games, as well as the NBA Street series. His passion for storytelling was demonstrated when he worked on NBA Street as the lead designer, ensuring that even a sports game had a plot. After finishing Def Jam Vendetta, many ideas remained for another game, and in the development process early on that the gameplay would move away from the wrestling found in the original and be shaped by combat from other fighting games and genres. =Propaganda Games= In 2005, he co-founded Propaganda Games. While there he worked on the reboot of the Turok first person shooter game series. Propaganda Games was acquired by Disney Interactive shortly after it opened. In 2008, Holmes left Propaganda Games and Disney Interactive, citing creative differences. =343 Industries= He joined 343 Industries in 2009 and was an executive producer on Halo Waypoint and Halo: Reach. Holmes stated he was drawn to the challenge of working at 343 Industries because it was founded specifically to become the caretaker of the Halo series, with only approximately 25 people working there when he joined. The Halo Waypoint website was a labor of love, Holmes has stated, and he and his team were \\"blown away\\" by the number of people accessing the site. As part of the development of Halo: Reach, Holmes worked with Bungie who had made the previous Halo installments. One of Holmes' favorite aspects of Reach was the \\"melancholy feel you had that you were understanding the stakes of the challenge and things weren't necessarily going to end up all rosy\\". He was the creative director for Halo 4, and stated that early in the design process the design team was \\"on the road to play it too safe\\", and the team gained confidence over time to make changes from the original trilogy. Part of the redesign of Halo that Holmes initiated was the make the game faster paced, making both Master Chief and his enemies move more quickly, and include much larger game spaces for characters to explore. Visual changes included rebuilding all the characters \\"from scratch\\" to optimize their performances. An aspect of Halo 4s design that was preserved was the presenting of challenges to players, but not forcing it upon them and making the game linear. Holmes worked on introducing enemy cues and unique behaviors gradually and individually so that players had to fight creatively and effectively. Single player mode was imagined to be a training ground for multiplayer, and for success there to lead to continued membership in the Halo fan community. Holmes described his development strategy as \\"one game at a time\\", mentioning that even though Halo 4 is the first part of a trilogy, all focus was on the story and gameplay experience of the individual title. The game also was built to have a deeper resonance the more you know about the story, such as if a player had played the previous games, or had read the extended universe novels. After four years of designing Halo 4 and playing the game for thousands of hours, Holmes stated he still loves the game, particularly due to the work on the story and the freedom players have to \\"play with the world and explore\\". In November 2016, Holmes announced that he would be departing 343 Industries to pursue a career in indie game development. Design philosophy and influences Part of Holmes design is that the gameplay should be accessible to as many people as possible, including those who are new to established games such as Halo. This is thought to level the playing field in terms of multiplayer skill and increase the players satisfaction.

Although an architectural standout when new in 1883, by the late 1970s it was vacant, and remained so for three decades, vandalized and deteriorating. In 2009 the city demolished, for safety, most of what remained after a 1997 fire, but in 2012 a developer undertook to rebuild it for commercial occupancy, and the building re√∂pened in May 2015. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989, and was designated a New York City Landmark in 1993. The banking years The Mount Morris Bank was organized in December 1880 when Harlem was being transformed from a suburb into an urban residential neighborhood, connected to downtown commercial and residential districts by the new Manhattan Railway Company lines. The bank initially rented space at 133 East 125th Street, just west of Lexington Avenue. Construction began on its new building ‚Äì which was selected by competition and located at 81, 83, and 85 East 125th Street ‚Äì on April 3, 1883 and was completed on February 1, 1884, although the bank, occupying the main floor, moved in by late 1883. Like its plainer neighbors, the building was designed for a mix of commercial and residential use. The basement, partially above ground, was initially occupied by the Mount Morris Safe Deposit Company at #83, which built and owned the building. There were six apartments on four floors above the commercial space, plus an attic. The apartments ‚Äì called \\"The Morris\\" ‚Äì were completely separated from the banking portion of the building. They had their own entrance at #81 and were served by an elevator, but they barely lasted two decades: by the early twentieth century the apartments were converted into offices. Architects Lamb & Rich utilized rock-faced sandstone in the Romanesque Revival style for the bank portions of the structure and red Philadelphia brick cladding for the residential portion in the Queen Anne style. At the time, the New York Central Railroad ran in an open cut along Park Avenue, with a (below-grade) station at 125th Street. The building's location was thus convenient for commuters as well as for commerce. In 1889-90 the building was doubled in size using the adjacent lot on its north (Park Avenue) side, in an expansion designed by the original architects, which included a basement entrance at 1820 Park Avenue. In 1912, architect Frank A. Rooke removed the front stoops and stairs, which projected onto the public sidewalk, and rebuilt the entranceways. In 1913 the Mount Morris Bank became a branch of the Corn Exchange Bank, the first New York City bank to establish local branches. The Corn Exchange Bank merged with Chemical Bank in 1954 and became the Chemical Corn Exchange Bank. Chemical closed the branch in the mid 1960s and moved its operations to a new location nearby, following which various commercial tenants and a church occupied the building. New York City took title in 1972 for back taxes. Destruction and rebuilding The building in 2011 By the late 1970s, when properties were being abandoned all over the city, the Corn Exchange structure was vacant, and remained mostly empty for three decades, vandalized and deteriorating. It was sealed up in 1987 at the request of the local Community Board. In 1989 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The city's Landmarks Preservation Commission considered the structure for designation as an official landmark in 1984, but didn't act at that time; in 1993, however, they did designate it, asserting that it retained its architectural integrity to a surprisingly high degree. (By law, the commission's powers over a city-owned property are merely advisory.) A fire destroyed the mansard roof and the two floors enclosed by it in 1997. In 2003 a community activist paid $10,000 for the building, planning a culinary school, but she was unable to finance her project, and the idea was never executed. The city repossessed the building in 2000 and in 2009 demolished all but the basement and main floor, for safety's sake. Developer Artimus Construction purchased the structure in 2012 and undertook to rebuild it for commercial and retail occupancy. The design, by Danois Architects, is not intended to be an exact copy of the original, but rather strongly suggestive of it, and was approved by the Landmarks Preservation Commission in 2013. The Corn Exchange Building reopened with an art fair in May 2015.

He taught at St. Pauls' parish school before joining Patrick Keely's architectural firm in the 1850s as an apprentice carpenter. At that time Houghton lived at 57 Nelson Street in Brooklyn. In 1853, he worked on the Church of St. Mary Star of the Sea on Court Street.St. Mary Star of the Sea Walking Tour During the American Civil War he served as a paymaster for the United States Navy.

In 1896 he was appointed lighthouse keeper at Old Field Point, and in 1901 received an appointment at the New York Navy Yard. He edited the Journal of William Maclay and was the author of History of the United States Navy, which occasioned much controversy and brought about his dismissal from government employ, by order of President Roosevelt, in 1901. The ground of this action, following Maclay's refusal of an official request for his resignation, was a passage in the History stigmatizing Rear Admiral Winfield Scott Schley as a ‚Äúcaitiff, poltroon and coward‚Äù for his conduct in the naval fight off Santiago, Cuba on 3 July 1898.

It also became Johnson's first hit single after the song was nationally distributed by United Artists. It was recorded at United Sound Systems.Graham Betts. The Motown Encyclopedia. AC Publishing, 2014. Background In 1958, Marv Johnson was singing with a local group the Serenaders in Detroit. It was while performing at a carnival in Michigan that Johnson was noted by rising record label impresario Berry Gordy, who was looking to sign acts into his fledgling company. Originally the label was to be called Tammy Records, which he named after the Debbie Reynolds hit, \\"Tammy\\", that is until a record label of the same name took notice, forcing Gordy to alter the name to Tamla Records. After discovering Johnson, he convinced him to sign with Tamla and in February 1959, the 20-year-old Johnson co-wrote and recorded the song, \\"Come to Me\\". Gordy assembled several musicians, including bassist James Jamerson and drummer Benny Benjamin, and background vocalists the Rayber Voices, to contribute to the song with Johnson. Charts \\"Come to Me\\" was first distributed by Tamla in May 1959 and was a local hit in the Midwest. Since Tamla was still a local company and was unable to get national distribution to the record, Gordy sold rights of the song to United Artists who agreed to distribute the song nationally. The plan worked as the song began to be a national hit at the end of 1959. By early 1960, the song had reached number 30 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 6 on the national R&B; chart.[ Come to Me at Allmusic] Johnson would record in Motown's studios while recording for United Artists. Johnson returned to Motown in the late 1960s after his success peaked in the mid-1960s. In 1990, Johnson re-recorded the song for an album he recorded for Motorcity Records.

Loomis, and his wife Elizabeth (n√©e McLanahan). He was the brother of Stanley Loomis. He grew up in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, and attended Phillips Exeter Academy. He earned a B.A. from Princeton University in 1952, and an M.A. from Columbia University in 1955. He served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War before returning to teach English and American literature first at the University of Vermont and then at Dartmouth College, Hanover, where he remained from 1963 to his retirement in 1997. He served as chair of the department from 1977 to 1980. He completed his Ph.D. at Princeton in 1966.Obituary by Constance Martin in Arctic, vol. 62, no. 3, September 2009, pp. 361-62. In 1968, he led an expedition to Greenland, one of five expeditions to the Arctic he made during his lifetime. On this first trip, he received permission to disinter the body of Charles Francis Hall, a Cincinnati journalist who had made two attempts (1860‚Äì63 and 1864‚Äì69) to find the grave of Sir John Franklin, and who himself died in the course of an 1871 attempt to reach the North Pole. Rumours had suggested that Hall had not died of natural causes. Loomis received a Smithsonian grant to go to Greenland, dig up Hall‚Äôs body, take samples of the hair and fingernails, and send them for forensic analysis. Although he succeeded in doing so, the results of the analysis were not conclusive: the remains contained traces of arsenic, which could indicate poisoning, but since arsenic was a component of many medicines, it is possible that Hall had inadvertently overdosed himself. This research expedition inspired Loomis‚Äôs well-known book, Weird and Tragic Shores: The Story of Charles Francis Hall, Explorer, published by Knopf in 1971. A 2001 article by Sara Wheeler in the New York TimesSara Wheeler, \\"In Cold Blood?\\" New York Times, February 25, 2001 notes: The book has been maintained in print by the Modern Library and was the subject of a CBC television documentary in the early 1970s. In 1981, the National Geographic Society cited the book in its Atlas of the World by marking the location of Hall's grave on its map of Greenland and noting: Chauncey C. Loomis wrote many essays about the Arctic, most notably ‚ÄúThe Arctic Sublime,‚Äù which appeared in Nature and the Victorian Imagination, edited by U.C. Knoepflmacher and G.B. Tennyson (University of California Press, 1977). This article focuses on the watercolours and drawings of early Arctic explorers and their relationship to their journals and narratives. He also wrote many reviews of books about the North for the London Review of Books as well as articles about Thackeray, Joyce, Twain, and Stephen Crane for scholarly journals. In 1996, Loomis, with art historian Constance Martin, annotated and wrote the introduction for an illustrated edition of Arctic Explorations: The Second Grinnell Expedition in Search of Sir John Franklin, 1853 by Elisha Kent Kane (R.R. Donnelley & Sons, 1996). He was a lifelong member of the Arctic Institute of North America. Loomis was an avid fly fisherman and a keen photographer, and travelled to Peru, Kenya, and Sikkim, to photograph archeological sites, people, and wildlife. In 1964, he made a CBS documentary about muskoxen in Alaska, titled Wild River, Wild Beasts. In retirement, he served on many boards and through the Berkshire Taconic Community Foundation established a fund to help students from Berkshire County High School attend college. After his death, the Foundation received a $2 million bequest from his estate directed to a variety of education, health, social service, art and environmental organizations.Berkshire Taconic press release He died of lung cancer at Fairview Hospital in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, at the age of 78.

Ritter moved to Chicago and began to take a serious interest in art. He audited the night classes of Dr. Schroeder at the Chicago Art Institute. Ritter returned to Los Angeles where he later won a scholarship to the Art Center School (now, Art Center College of Design). He was introduced to figure painting under the tutelage of Stanley Reckless who had studied at the Philadelphia Academy of Art and taught in the tradition of Frank Duveneck and the Munich School. This tradition involved the classical study of anatomy and used live models for subjects. The Munich School is characterized by a naturalistic style and dark chiaroscuro.

The one-man show at the Newhouse Galleries was a particular success and led to portrait commissions. While attending a party thrown by a patron who commissioned a portrait of his daughter, Ritter got drunk and stripped off his clothes, calling the other attendees \\"phony baloneys\\". He returned to Los Angeles. Ritter met Hildegarde \\"Hilde\\" Sabena Meyer-Radon in 1942 when he saw her walking past his studio to take violin lessons from an instructor next door.

Because there was no waiting period for a marriage license in Mississippi, Hilde and Ritter traveled the next morning to Hernando, Mississippi, where they got a license and were married in a small chapel on April 9, 1943. The two had a six-week honeymoon in a Memphis hotel room while he completed the painting of General Lear. After the portrait was complete, Ritter returned to Camp Pickett but was reassigned to the 1st Battalion which was later re-designated as the 2829th Battalion. The 40th Engineers received additional training at Fort Pierce, Florida, and then deployed to the Gulf of Oran, Algeria, for further training. He took part in the invasion of Sicily. Based on his military service, Ritter became a US citizen on October 30, 1943.U.S. Naturalization Record Indexes, 1791-1992 He attained the rank of Technician Fourth Grade (T4) and served at both Regimental headquarters and the headquarters of the 1st/2829th Battalion. In October 1945 Ritter returned to Los Angeles to paint and to raise a family.  Post-war Southern California = 1945 to 1966 = When Ritter first returned from the war, he found himself unable to paint anything but morbid, gruesome paintings of death, darkness and despair for about a year. After this he began his most prolific period. He would regularly work long hours and he became known for his fine nude studies and clowns. Ritter and Hilde had two children while living in Hollywood: Christine was born in 1947 and Michael in 1948. Art critic Arthur Miller of the Los Angeles Times wrote in a 1947 review of Ritter's one-man show at the James Vigeveno Galleries in Westwood, California:By Arthur Miller. \\"Ritter Work Has Merit\\".

Ritter > has chosen to paint clowns, he explains, because 'In the clown one sees all > the emotions a man can express; to record him is to depict humanity itself.' Ritter moved the family to Don Pio Drive in Woodland Hills, California, in the early 1950s. The home included a studio building on a hilltop which, like all his studios, featured a pot-belly stove. In addition to his painting, Ritter was a talented landscaper and he terraced the front and rear hills with steps, paths and pools all made from slabs of broken concrete. At the urging of his brother-in-law, Stewart Potter, Ritter began selling his paintings in Las Vegas in February, 1950. The two made the trip from Los Angeles to Las Vegas in Ritter's 1949 Dodge Wayfarer, a yellow convertible with no rear seat and an extended trunk which would be packed with paintings. The two went from casino to casino without any success until they met Bill Moore, the owner of the Hotel Last Frontier. Ritter sold Moore 13 framed nudes for $1000 which would become the basis of the Silver Slipper Collection of paintings. Ritter and Potter would make additional trips to Las Vegas and sold additional paintings to the Hotel Last Frontier and its adjoining Silver Slipper Casino. They also sold paintings to other hotels, casinos and their employees. Shortly after this, Otto Eitel, owner of the Bismarck Hotel which was at the center of Chicago's Loop entertainment district, invited Ritter to do a one-man show at the Swiss Chalet Galleries and to paint a mural for the Bismarck Inn. This show was successful and led to numerous commissions including the \\"Mr Whimsey\\" clowns for the U.O. Colson Company. Ritter's wife and children stayed in Chicago with him for several months while he completed his commissions. Ritter was enjoying success with his clown and nude paintings but, at the same time, he felt trapped by this success. He was not painting the great works he imagined. For inspiration, in 1956 he moved his family to Mexico, primarily living in San Blas, Nayarit, a small town on the Pacific Coast of Mexico located between Mazatlan and Puerto Vallarta. Ritter wrote in a note published in the Los Angeles Times \\"the place is a paradise for landscape painters and living is cheap.\\"\\"NEWS AND VIEWS OF ART\\". Los Angeles Times. Feb 17, 1957, pg. E5 Ritter said later, \\"My time in San Blas was important to me. I developed a new conception of color and a self-assurance which made me a better painter.\\" After nearly a year in San Blas, Ritter returned to California in 1957 and purchased the house at 2321 Edgewater Way in the Santa Barbara Mesa neighborhood. Ritter again turned the yard into a remarkable garden. Hilde worked at the noted Brooks Institute of Photography while Ritter continued to paint steadily as his paintings commanded higher values. Most importantly, Ritter was, at last, free to paint the works he wanted to. Ritter's work was represented in continuing exhibitions at the Poulsen GalleriesDisplay Ad 91 -- \\"Poulsen Galleries\\".

Ritter was at the height of his commercial success but he disliked that the galleries were making money that he felt should be going to him. He had always had a somewhat stormy relationship with his dealers and preferred to deal directly with collectors. About this time, Ritter successfully set out to build a group of patrons who could provide financial security and independence, however, many of these collectors were demanding the familiar nudes and clowns that Ritter had tired of. In 1958, the Circus company in Los Angeles published and distributed five reproductions of mounted 8x10 inch paintings. The paintings included the clowns Dilly, Flim, Flam, Helter and Skelter.Portraits of clowns [graphic]. 5 reproductions of paintings ; mounted 8 x 10 in. Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division, Washington D.C. 1958 In 1963, Ritter had a show at the Poulsen Galleries in Pasadena, California. It was generally well-received with Scott McClean, the gallery director, stating \\"This is probably the first exhibit to show the whole range and variety of the work of a man who has been known for two specialties ‚Äì nudes and clowns. I think this broader view of Julian Ritter's work is long overdue.\\" But not all reviews of Ritter's work were glowing.

When she collapsed, Ritter insisted and doctors discovered she had cancer. She had a mastectomy and struggled for two years before succumbing to the disease. Hilde died January 22, 1966.California Death Index, 1940-1997 Ritter began drinking heavily. He later said, \\"I became a lousy cowardly drunk after my wife died. I had no respect for myself - morally, physically or spiritually. My mind and my body and my inner-self were too tired to conceive anything. I was burnt out.\\" = 1966 to 1985 = Ritter aboard his 45-foot yawl, Galilee, in the harbor at Puntarenas, Costa Rica. During 1965‚Äì66, Ritter painted a portrait of 17-year- old Lauren \\"Laurie\\" Kokx. He felt that he needed to get away from the Edgewater Way house that held so many memories of his wife, so he sold the house and its contents for $37,000. He bought a custom-built yawl still under construction in Morro Bay, California.By Shearlean Duke. \\"4 RESCUED; Ship Runs Into Bad Luck--Again 'Bewitched' Ship Runs Into Bad Luck Again\\". Los Angeles Times. February 7, 1976, p. OC1 Ritter named the boat Galilee, and with the assistance of a two-man crew, on February 2, 1968,\\"Seagoing Art Studio\\". Santa Barbara News-Press. February 3, 1968, p A-3 he sailed it to various ports including Acapulco, Mexico, where he was joined by Kokx. They sailed to Puntarenas, Costa Rica, where he painted for six months. He then sailed to the Galapagos Islands, Tahiti, Moorea and Bora Bora, sketching tropical scenes for later development as paintings. In December, 1968, a show was mounted at the Bernard Gallery in Los Angeles of works painted in Puntarenas that Ritter had sent home. With Kokx and another crew member, Ritter left Bora Bora for Hawaii on June 17, 1970, expecting a 30-day voyage. Serious problems arose with the boat's equipment, and it began to take on sea water. Continually bailing, Ritter and his crew drifted for 87 days, running out of food and water, fearing death. On September 14, 1970, the Galilee was rescued by the U.S. Navy combat stores ship, USS Niagara Falls.\\"On Rescue ship\\". Los Angeles Times'.' September 18, 1970, p. C4. Ship's doctor Philip A. Becker described the emaciated crew members as \\"living skeletons only four days away from death.\\"By Shearlean Duke. \\"The Galilee: Is It a Boat Bewitched?\\" Los Angeles Times. February 21, 1974, p. D1 Ritter and Kokx recuperated in Hawaii for a month, then returned to California. Although he was still recovering and underweight, Ritter gave a three-hour talk at a Los Angeles gallery about being lost at sea. In attendance were family members, patrons and his first wife. Ritter appeared on the TV game show To Tell the Truth along with two \\"impostor\\" contestants and the celebrity panelists in an episode that aired December 22, 1970. All three of the panelists picked Ritter since he was the only one of the three contestants who looked like he had been lost at sea without food.Sunday TV Guide. Los Angeles Times. December 20, 1970, pg L16 Ritter donated six of his clown paintings for an auction to raise money for a group working for the release of American prisoners of war held in North Vietnam. The auction was held mid-December 1970. Among the guests of honor was Francis Gary Powers whose U-2 spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union. One painting, a 24x36 oil, was reportedly sold for $3600. Ritter made the contribution out of sympathy for the prisoners and their families and personal gratitude to the Navy for his rescue.\\"ART NEWS :'Helix' Show Due at UCLA\\". Los Angeles Times. December 20, 1970, pg M61 Ritter said \\"I know what deprivation is after that ordeal. I can relate to the terrible suffering of those POWs.\\"\\"Art Auction Raises Funds to Help POWs\\". Los Angeles Times. December 14, 1970, pg SG6 Ritter and Kokx settled into a house in rural Summerland outside Santa Barbara for 15 years. Ritter's near-death experience catalyzed two years of intense painting. During this period, Ritter was arguably at the peak of his artistic expression. He was already a fulfilled artist who saw himself as a maestro and people treated him accordingly. His subject matter included paintings which were more mystical as he worked out the demons from the voyage, his loss of Hilde and his own alcoholism. To meet the demands of his collectors and his need for money, Ritter continued painting nudes, portraits and occasional clown compositions. Ritter had a show in late 1975 at the Howard E. Morseburg Galleries on Wilshire in Los Angeles which included some of this new work. The show was called \\"Julian's World\\" and consisted of 101 paintings and 16 drawings. This was Ritter's last major public exhibit. One painting which did stand out was a crucifixion: Ritter had posed and was photographed and then painted himself onto the cross in a self-portrait. Ritter preferred to sell directly to collectors so he could make more money. Ritter had a sufficient number of patrons at this point in his life so that he no longer needed to rely on gallery showings. However, many of these patrons were most interested in his commercial nudes and clowns rather than the more artistic paintings. Hawaii In the summer of 1984, Ritter and Kokx separated. In 1985, Ritter and his son Michael moved into a house in Kula, Hawaii, on the island of Maui. He suffered a debilitating stroke in December 1985. After a period of convalescence, Ritter began painting again. Although the stroke limited his painting ability, he wrote and he taught painting. In 1989, Michael commissioned a 30-minute video about the life and art of his father, titled Julian Ritter‚ÄîPalette of passion. It was written and produced by Keith Gilchrist and was filmed and directed by Christopher Gentsch. Ritter died at home on March 4, 2000, at the age of 90.  Religion and politics  Ritter was raised a Roman Catholic although he was not religious in his adult life ‚Äî Ritter led the life of a hedonistic artist. Some family members recount that he did frequent Catholic churches to reflect. Although his paintings were not overtly religious, many of his works did have a mystical quality. One example is \\"The Clown Funeral\\". In it, clowns are bearing one of their own, eyes closed but wearing a beautiful clown smile. Ritter appears in self- portrait in the painting. Some compare this painting to El Greco's \\"El Entierro Del Conde De Orgaz\\" (\\"The Burial of the Count of Orgaz\\").  Friends and patrons  Ritter had a number of interesting friends. George Morgan, the son of Frank Morgan (The Wizard of Oz), who was wealthy from the family business distributing Angostura Bitters, was a drinking buddy. John Coleman, who taught at Art Center, and his family were also close friends who visited the Edgewater Way house frequently. Ritter befriended Chick Rosenthal who lived in the same Hollywood bungalows in the 1930s and maintained that friendship until Rosenthal's death. Rosenthal accompanied Ritter to New York in a van in 1941 when Ritter was offered the one-man show at the Newhouse Galleries. Ritter began a long-term friendship with Rudolph Axford(Rudolph Axford dies at 79; Venice activist, boat restorer\\") from Venice, California, in the mid-1950s. Axford shared Ritter's conservative politics and love of boats, and was a Ritter patron who accumulated many pieces of his work. Greg Autry was another friend and patron. Autry met Ritter in 1983 after he purchased a fake Ritter in a Laguna Beach gallery. Autry both commissioned paintings and purchased other examples of Ritter's work. Autry purchased the Silver Slipper collection of Ritter's paintings from the Summa Corporation in a closed-bid auction in the late 1980s.  Art  Although Ritter was best known for his oil paintings of nudes, clowns and portraits, he also worked in other media including pen-and-ink with watercolor, charcoal and Cont√© crayons and painted other subjects including portraits, landscapes, and complex compositions. He also liked doing caricature, often drawing cartoons rather than sending letters to friends. Ritter's style changed over the course of his life. Art historian and award-winning author Phyllis Settacase Barton wrote of Ritter: > Labeling the work of Julian Ritter is not easy because his genius is not > readily defined. This is because for most of his life he has painted women > as though he were exploring a garden ‚Äì with eyes, lips and nipples painted > like blue, red and pink blossoms. His earlier work also includes lots of > clowns, many of which he painted with introspection and compassion ‚Äì > generally to the exclusion of their surroundings ‚Äì telling us that his mind, > heart and eye were in league with the human being beneath the costume, > behind the make-up.

One example of a mixed-media watercolor and chalk is \\"Bachelor's Housekeeping\\" painted in 1939. The painting was at the DeYoung Museum in San Francisco in 1963. DeYoung Museum Advanced \\"Search by Artist\\" for Julian Ritter. Retrieved April 10, 2011 Ritter had a steady presence in the Los Angeles art scene with exhibitions and showings from 1947 through 1975 when he had his last major gallery showing at the Howard E. Morseburg Galleries in Los Angeles. His work was typically on display in any given week at some gallery in Southern California as evidenced through display ads in the Sunday Los Angeles Times.Display Ad 86 -- \\"Art Center Gallery\\".

Los Angeles Times. December 15, 1963, pg B14\\"Calendar of Events\\". Los Angeles Times. January 21, 1965, pg SG12\\"This Week's Calendar\\". Los Angeles Times. February 13, 1966, pg B14 After this, Ritter had a sufficient number of patrons to support his lifestyle without the need for gallery showings. = Portraits = Ritter painted a number of prominent Californians. He also painted many actors, especially while employed at Warner Brothers where he would paint an actor in his current role. For instance, he painted Paul Muni in his role as Zola in The Life of Emile Zola. He also painted Ruby Keeler, Clara Bow, Claudette Colbert, Olivia de Havilland and Veronica Lake. = Nudes and showgirls = Ritter painted several variations of the horizontal nude pose. Other nudes include paintings of Janet Boyd, a successful Las Vegas showgirl, who he also painted as a showgirl in his painting \\"The Gibson Girl.\\" Boyd later wrote to Ritter: \\"...I only got to be with you a few years but wonderful memories I have and will cherish. Not every girl gets to be a Ritter model. I loved every moment posing for you. The early mornings working in the studio in Santa Barbara are happy memories for me. And because your works of me will keep me young and beautiful forever.\\" There were many other nudes using various models. Ritter painted a number of nudes of his first wife, the actress Francesca Chesley. Ritter also painted a couple of nudes of his second wife, Hilde. The latter remain in the family collection. He also painted many showgirl paintings, the most famous of which is \\"Ruby,\\" a painting of an African-American girl. He made several showgirl paintings using a model named LeeAnn which were also commercially successful. = Clowns = Although he had painted clowns before, Ritter started painting a series of unusual or tender clowns in the summer of 1948. His first visit to a circus was in 1949. Ritter said of his clown paintings \\"I don't need to see clowns. My clown portraits are more like human portraits in clown make-up. They are a combination of my imagination and my memory of faces, or even my own face.\\" Ritter was commissioned in the early 1950s by an art gallery on Ventura Blvd in the San Fernando Valley to paint a set of small 8\\"x10\\" clowns called the Helter Skelter Clowns. The clowns included Dilly, Dally, Flim, Flam, Pitter, Patter and Helter and Skelter. These were reproduced for the mass market in 1958. Ritter also painted a series of clowns based on \\"Mr. Whimsey,\\" a clown with his dog. The U.O. Colson Company of Illinois commissioned Ritter to paint a set of these paintings for a calendar. He painted several more \\"Mr. Whimsey\\" paintings, some of which were part of the Silver Slipper collection. Ritter also painted a number of clown compositions featuring groups of clowns (e.g.,\\"Clown Band and \\"Clown Funeral\\") and clown with nude or showgirl montages. Some of these feature a single clown with his arm around a showgirl, others portrayed a single nude surrounded by a variety of clowns and others were groups of clowns. Ritter tired of painting his commercially successful clowns and made the painting \\"Clown Funeral\\" to announce the end of his clown paintings. After that, he painted only the occasional clown composition or a clown painting commissioned by a patron. = Landscapes = Although he was known primarily as a figurative painter, Ritter painted a number of landscapes, particularly when he was in San Blas, Mexico, and when he made his Pacific voyage. Ritter said of the San Blas paintings that they informed him with a new sense of color. The South Pacific seemed to further transform Ritter's paintings in much the same manner as it had on Paul Gauguin decades earlier. Though these never achieved the commercial success of his nudes and clowns, they were arguably amongst his best paintings. = Lifescapes = Ritter was a man who lived in his emotions. His paintings have been described as a \\"visual record of his emotional life.\\" Nowhere is this more true than in the paintings art historian Phyllis Settacase Barton called \\"lifescapes.\\" It could be argued that the first of these lifescapes were the clown compositions. The painting, \\"Clown Band\\" is no less a joyful presentation of life than Ritter's later work, \\"God's Children.\\" \\"Clown Funeral\\" was a deeply introspective look with Ritter, in self-portrait, carrying the body of a fallen clown - his announcement that he was no longer interested in painting the clowns that had brought him so much commercial success. The montages of clown with either nudes or showgirls shows the duality in all of us - the sensuality and eroticism of the female form with the detached folly of the accompanying clown(s). But the true lifescapes were those works that Ritter painted when he had the patronage that allowed him to eschew dealing with galleries - Ritter finally started painting the great compositions which he saw in his visions. These works were described as \\"mystical looks into the core of existence and the meaning of life.\\" Many of these were painted during and after the voyage that almost took his life but which also opened his mind and heart to see deeper and more introspective subjects and expressions. Paintings of the voyage revealed the absolute terror in the hollowed-out eyes of the subjects. The mystical paintings revealed a faith that higher powers were at work. One critic wrote \\"Julian is a man who has seen life, absorbed it and now presents it.\\" Sweeping and majestic paintings presented the very essence of Ritter's emotions. \\"The Carousel\\" was a complicated composition exploring man's spiritual nature. Ritter dealt with man's hypocrisy in \\"The Sunday Preacher\\". Ritter's \\"Man on the Cross\\" was a deeply personal view into Ritter's emotions as he painted his self-portrait onto the cross. One critic wrote of the piece: \\"Undoubtedly, it is a daring and modern interpretation of life. It is a work which will cause considerable controversy. But what great artist hasn't caused that? What artist of any note has not or will not speak his own mind through his pictures?\\" When Ritter and Kokx separated in the summer of 1984, Ritter's work became more dark expressing the aloneness he felt in his partner's absence. Ritter's work changed again when he went to Maui, building again on the spiritual. Art historian Phyllis Settacase Barton wrote of these paintings: \\"In the glowing panoramic scenes, powerfully and prayerfully, Julian Ritter lets us in on some of his most intimate secrets, eases us into his precious discoveries and shares with us deepest concerns.\\" = Silver Slipper Casino collection = The Silver Slipper Casino collection started in February, 1950 when Ritter sold 13 framed nude paintings for $1000 to Bill Moore, the owner of the Last Frontier Hotel. By 1962, 33 paintings of nudes, showgirls, clowns and clown/nude montages adorned the walls of the upstairs theater. On April 4, 1955, the Last Frontier Hotel became the New Frontier Hotel under the management Jacob Kozloff. In 1967, Howard Hughes bought both the New Frontier Hotel and the Silver Slipper Casino. After Hughes' death, Howard Hughes' Summa Corporation sold both the Silver Slipper Casino and the Frontier Hotel to the Elardi family in 1988 and divested itself of its contents including the paintings which were auctioned off in a closed-bid auction. Greg Autry won the auction and continues to hold the collection which has not been seen for many years.The Las Vegas Strip: The Early Years.

WDLA UK, Lancaster UK, 2011. ISSN 1368-485X Design and development The Swing is a conventionally laid out ultralight/LSA aircraft with a single engine and high wing. The composite parts are built using a vacuum technology producing a sandwich structure. The fuel tank, engine mount and lift struts use melamine composites. The constant chord wings, carrying 3¬∞ of dihedral, are built from GRP composite with hard leading edges and fabric elsewhere. Each wing has a single lift strut with a short auxiliary strut joining it near the wing. The wings carry GRP mass-balanced ailerons and three-position plain flaps.Tacke, Willi; Marino Boric; et al: World Directory of Light Aviation 2015-16, page 78. Flying Pages Europe SARL, 2015. The fin of the Swing has a strongly swept leading edge and a nearly upright rudder. Early versions had an all moving, though braced, tailplane mounted about halfway up the fin but more recently this has been replaced by a fuselage mounted tailplane. Narrow near the tail, the fuselage increases in diameter to the cabin, placed under the wings. Cockpit width is . The cockpit features bulged, glazed doors to improve visibility and room. Dual controls are standard, the seating side by side. The early Swings were powered by either 60 kW (80 hp) Rotax 912 UL flat-four engine or the two-stroke twin-cylinder 49 kW (65 hp) Rotax 582 UL, driving propellers with two or more blades. Current (2010) aircraft have the 74 kW (99 hp) Rotax 912 ULS flat-four with a two-bladed propeller. The Swing has a fixed undercarriage, which may be of either tricycle or tailwheel configuration. The aircraft has been accepted in the United States as a special light-sport aircraft. Operational history Swings were produced for the Czech market until around 1997. Eleven had been sold by the time it became available in the United States from 2007. Thirteen had been produced by mid-2010.

Biography Slobodanka Stupar graduated from Applied Arts School in Belgrade (B.F.A.) She graduated School of Fine Arts at University of Belgrade (M.F.A.) She specialized at the School of Fine Arts in Athens. The work The separation of elementary metaphors and other figurative mechanisms, i.e. deconstruction, has become an effective tool for understanding and interpreting recent visual art. This is especially true where the artist has moved from a more \\"classical\\" form of expression, arising from an academic training, to a practice involving a visualized language and semantic composition mode of expression, of which Slobodanka Stupar is an example. This transition was all the more likely in her case given the freedom which she already had in using the graphic art medium, closer to experimentation than the reproduction of any standard approach. Even from the outset of her artistic career she had been leaning towards a reexamination of the expressive capabilities of visual art.Jovan Despotoviƒá, Slobodanka Stupar, Arti, vol. 39, may-july, p.p. 204-207, Athens, 1998 Combining the incompatible, to maintain any discourse (in this case visual) one has to remove or circumvent ordinary comprehensibility, or \\"sense\\"; to make something \\"apparent\\" the plastic narrative had to be reduced to the brink of unrecognizability in order to be \\"seen\\" as a new work. This is precisely the kind of work Stupar has been producing over the last few years. The works at this exhibition are among those which have emerged from this new understanding of the function of art works as self-sufficient structures of meaning, autonomously establishing the scope of their own significance.Jovan Despotoviƒá, Above and Below, (pref), Subjectil is Subjectil, (Slobodanka Stupar, monograph, Gallery \\"Belgrade\\", Belgrade, 2011) Grants and residencies * 1980‚Äì1981 Young Artists grant, Belgrade * 1983 \\"Mosa Pijade\\" grant for residence in London * 1985 Scholarship from Ministry of Education of Greece, Athens * 1991 The Grant of Fondation pour une Entraide Intellectuelle Europeene, Paris * 1996 Stiftung Kulturfonds, Haus Lukas, Ahrenshoop, (Germany) Awards and recognitions * 1987 October Salon Price for Graphic Art, Belgrade * 1987 Price for Sculpture from Art Colony Sisak, Sisak, (Croatia) * 1989 Purchase Price from the National University Library at XII Zagreb, Exhibition of Contemporary Yugoslav Drawing, Zagreb * 1990 Grand Prix at the IX Frechen International Graphic Triennial, Germany * 1993 2nd Prize at Biennial of Dry Point, U≈æice, (Yugoslavia) * 1997 Purchase Price from National Museum at Belgrade International Biennial of Graphic Art, Belgrade * 1999 Price at Fotowettbewerb Award 1999.

The game involves taking the role of Kenny Dalglish as he manages an English football team from the Football League Fourth Division right to the Football League First Division. Kenny Dalglish Soccer Manager is a spiritual successor to the 1982 video game Football Manager. Gameplay The game shows a job security rating as one of the statistics. The game is played mainly through icons and menus. A chairman can be consulted if players made the right decision while a physiotherapist can check for player injuries and the football scout can find players that can be recruited into the team. Match highlights can be either enable or disabled; but the results tell the identical story as the highlights. Prior to each game, players can be transferred to and from the reserves list in order to determine a starting lineup for each game. Each player is sorted by their offense and defense ratings in addition to their age and ability levels. Players are also reminded when a game is either a league game, a cup games, or a simple friendly match that doesn't determine anything. All transactions are done using the English pound currency. Even the attendance and amount of money earned from gate fees are tracked in the game. In the actual game itself, basic 16-color graphics help to keep track of the on-screen football action. Loans can be acquired from the in-game bank in order to keep the team afloat; owing too much money to the bank forces the board of directors to fire the player for financial incompetence. Reception Your Sinclair magazine gave the ZX Spectrum version of this video game a score of 85 out of 100 (the equivalent to 85% or a B letter grade).

She was best known as the coach of Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean, the 1984 Olympic champions, and also trained 1980 world champions Krisztina Reg≈ëczy and Andr√°s Sallay, and 1972 European champions Angelika and Erich Buck. Early life Betty Daphne Roberts was born in Reading, Berkshire on 22 March 1928, the daughter of William and Elizabeth Roberts. She grew up in London, where she attended a convent school. She originally wanted to become a ballet dancer and applied to the Royal Ballet School, but was turned down because they considered her too tall. She later developed an interest in ice skating and took lessons at the Queens Ice Rink in Bayswater. She joined the Blackpool Pleasure Beach ice show as a performer at the age of 16, where she met her future husband Roy Callaway, a principal skater there. Career In 1950 Callaway and Roy, now married, became skating coaches at Richmond Ice Rink in Twickenham. Callaway's pupils included Princess Anne who took lessons over three winters; Prince Charles also took lessons for approximately six weeks during a school holiday. The competitive skaters she trained included Yvonne Suddick and Roger Kennerson, who were three times medallists at the European Championships. Callaway became the national ice dancing trainer for West Germany in 1969, where she coached Angelika and Erich Buck to gold at the 1972 European Championships. After returning to the UK she coached Hungarian couple Krisztina Reg≈ëczy and Andr√°s Sallay, who were world champions and Olympic silver medallists in 1980. In 1978 Callaway began working with Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean, who had previously been coached by Janet Sawbridge. Torvill and Dean dominated ice dancing between 1981 and 1984, winning four consecutive World Championships and gold at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, where they received 12 maximum 6.0 marks for their free programme. They retired from amateur competition to turn professional after the Olympics, and Callaway stepped down as their coach. She was appointed MBE for services to ice dancing later that year. For the 1993‚Äì94 season Torvill and Dean returned to amateur competition following a change in the rules which allowed former professional skaters to regain amateur status, and teamed up with Callaway once again. They won the 1994 European title and took the bronze medal at the Lillehammer Olympics. During the 1990s Callaway coached Marika Humphreys, who won the British National Championships five times with various partners, and the Lithuanian couple Margarita Drobiazko and Povilas Vanagas.  Personal life  She married Roy Callaway (1917‚Äì2014) in 1949. The couple divorced in 1975, and in 1978 she married British Airways captain William Fittall. She was widowed in 1988 when Fittall died in a house fire. She was later reconciled with Roy Callaway and they remarried in 2003, remaining together until her death. Callaway was found dead at her home in Seer Green, Buckinghamshire on 27 June 2011. She had sustained a head injury thought to have resulted from a fall, and had been drinking according to toxicology reports. An inquest in September 2011 recorded a verdict of accidental death.

General election Harold Rushworth was originally declared the winner of the general election. Cause of by-election Supporters of Allen Bell filed a petition to the electoral court complaining of voting irregularities. Bell, however, claimed that he would take no part in any attempts to upset the election, leaving it up to his supporters. This petition was ultimately successful and it was announced by the court that a by-election should take place for the seat. Selection process Both Rushworth and Bell decided to run again for the seat. The Labour Party refused to put up a candidate, believing that the two candidates who had tied with each other should compete in the by-election. Result Rushworth won the by-election. This by-election clearly created much interest as the turnout was higher here than it was at the general election.

It premiered on September 25, 2011, after preview performances which began on July 21, 2011. The cost for production of the show was nearly $100,000,000, which included the cost of renovating the Dolby Theatre in which the show was housed. Iris was written and directed by French director-choreographer Philippe Decoufl√©. The show explored images from the history of cinema and featured elaborate choreography, acrobatics, and a variety of contemporary circus acts. The name of the show, Iris, comes from the camera diaphragm as well as from the colored iris of the human eye. In November 2012 it was reported that Iris would end its run at the Dolby Theatre on January 19, 2013 due to disappointing ticket sales. It was later reported that Cirque du Soleil looked into the possibility of taking Iris to other cities in the United States. Scenes from Iris would later be incorporated into the Cirque du Soleil show Paramour which debuted on Broadway in New York City on May 25, 2016. History Although Iris was in development for some time, the artists and creation team started preparations in Spain. At the beginning of March 2009, production and operations personnel started working in Montr√©al. During this time, the productions and the acrobatics continued to refine the show and artists continued training until the end of April when they moved to Los Angeles as well to continue preparing for the show's premiere. Cirque du Soleil employed 125 orchestral musicians to create the pre-recorded portions of the soundtrack. =In popular culture= * Acrobats from Iris performed the Kiriki act on America's Got Talent on September 14, 2011. Set and technical information Cirque du Soleil had to modify the stage in the theatre at a cost of , primarily to create stage lifts. To accommodate the lifts, deep pits were excavated. This changed the sets' space to measure from the high grid to the bottom of the pits. Cirque also removed seating from the theatre, reducing seat counts from 3400 to 2500, in order to give all spectators the same viewing experience. The creative team used 174 loudspeakers, 603 lighting features, 20 video projectors, and 166,000 watts of sound in the Iris production. The design of the \\"set suggests a fairground attraction inspired by Coney Island where movies were screened to an audience for the first time.\\" Cast The Iris troupe consists of 72 performers, including Olympic athletes. Principal characters include: * Buster: a composer in search of true love. * Scarlett: a na√Øve actress who longs to be a movie star. Acts According to the show creators, the acts of Iris are meant to evoke the sense of wonder of the cinema. * Aerial straps duo * Shadows and contortion * Hand to hand * Filmstrip * Kiriki: a modern version of Icarian games * Movie set * Trapeze and broom manipulation * Trampoline (The Rooftops) * Hand balancing * Aerial ball * Icarian Games Costumes Philippe Guillotel drew inspiration from numerous venues whose central theme was that of cinema. Through this extensive research into cinema's history his design team was able to create costumes which impress upon the viewer the evolution of color film. The team created a few unusual costumes for the hybrid characters: * The two camera men have cameras mounted on their head or chest. Their live camera footage becomes part of the show at times. * The sound man wears a large carbon fiber cone. * The screen man has a screen that tucks inside his stomach. * Another character's costume was inspired by the first sound equipment used to detect the sounds of bombs. The primary materials for this show included soft Lycra, silk stretch nylon, and natural cottons and linens. Philippe also used leather and high-tech materials such as carbon fiber for accent pieces, but stayed true to the use of the primary material selection. * The influence of Dick Tracy can be seen in the rooftops act, especially in the coloring of the costumes. * One female character, portrayed by actress Ekaterina Pirogovskaya, wears a skirt based on the zoetrope and praxinoscope that showed two boxers fighting as the skirt twirled. * The aerial ballet act costumes are made of nearly one million Swarovski crystals. * The costumes for the Icarian games, or Kiriki, characters are inspired by the costumes worn in Georges M√©li√®s films. * In addition to the hybrid characters of the camera men, sound man, screen man, and the sound equipment persona, there are also two chairs, a lamp, a table, and moose head on a wall that are personified. * In addition to cinema itself, some of the costumes pay tribute to the other professions associated with it, including screenwriters, makeup artists, cinematographers, carpenters, decorators, painters, electricians, and lighting designers. Music Iris' soundtrack was created by Danny Elfman. The music is created by pre-recorded music from a blend of 100 orchestral musicians (the largest in Cirque du Soleil's history) spread over both large and small ensembles, mixed with the show's eight live, in-house musicians.

Dalglish would also become famous for winning the FA Cup while playing and managing for the same team. The Australian magazine PC PowerPlay gave this game a rating of 5% in its February 1990 issue. Gameplay While the red player is rushing towards the ball, some of the guys on the blue team are trying to stop him. This was Dalglish's second licensed game and a side-scroller with a team in red playing against a team in blue. The skill level is divided into nine levels so that rookies can play against video game veterans. Passing the ball is similar to the Kick Off series except that it's only possible to make long passes; making quick passing purely a matter of luck. The ball bounces excessively; making it very difficult to shoot on target for less than 30 yards. Matches can last anywhere from 10 to 90 minutes; there are no leagues or tournaments to play against other teams. There are digitized photos of Dalglish himself; inspiring players to achieve goals and to have \\"good results.\\" Oddly enough, the player must type in the name (city, county, official nickname, etc.) of his team as well as the opponent's. This means that players can have their local weekly football club play against Manchester United or Chelsea with no difference in gameplay. Kenny Dalglish always gives the player valuable advice; expert players can choose to ignore it.

The episode follows the investigation of the death of a police officer killed in the line of duty. When detectives learn that his fellow officers delayed coming to his aid because he was gay, the district attorney's office prosecutes three of them for his death. \\"Manhood\\", the 21st episode of season 3, originally aired on May 12, 1993.Becker, p. 197 Plot NYPD police officer Rick Newhouse is killed when he is caught alone in a crossfire trying to break up a drug deal. Two units fail to arrive in time to back him up despite his repeated calls. Detectives Lennie Briscoe and Mike Logan quickly arrest a suspect, Lucio Martinez. In his statement, Martinez claims that a police car was parked just around the corner from the scene of the shooting. The detectives discover that Newhouse's service record has gone from spotless to very poor in a matter of months and suspect that he was left to die as payback for failing to overlook corruption in his precinct. Newhouse's commander, Captain Tom O'Hara, vehemently denies any corruption and tells the detectives and Captain Don Cragen that he personally demanded the suspension of four officers -- Rhodes, Harley, Davis and Weddeker -- for arriving late to the scene. Briscoe notices a transfer request on O'Hara's desk from Newhouse's partner, Craig McGraw, and finds it strange that he would want to be among strangers immediately after his partner's death. They talk with McGraw but he gives them nothing. They then search Newhouse's apartment and realize that backup was slow to arrive because Newhouse was gay. Ben Stone and Paul Robinette interview O'Hara and Sergeants Harley and Rhodes, all of whom deny that they knew Newhouse was gay. They interview McGraw, who gives them an anti-gay flier that had circulated at his precinct. After interviewing Officer Weddeker and learning that Harley and Rhodes deliberately delayed their cars' arrivals at the shooting, they indict Rhodes, Harley and Davis for second- degree murder. At trial, McGraw testifies that the officers in his precinct knew that he and Newhouse were gay, and that they both faced harassment because of it. Defense attorney Gordon Schell changes his strategy, offering psychiatric testimony to support a form of the gay panic defense: The officers, Schell argues, were \\"upholding the very values of the society that they've sworn to protect\\". Stone counters that homophobia is no more acceptable than hatred based on race, nationality, religion or politics, and that police officers who allow their own prejudices to interfere with their duties should be held accountable. Nevertheless, the jury acquits the defendants.

Moriarty felt that the original summation was weak and suggested that Stone should deliver a variation on Martin Niem√∂ller's famous First they came ... statement, relating the defendants' hatred for gay people to hatred for other groups that might include the jurors. Nathan agreed and rewrote the summation.Courrier and Green, p. 205 Gay media scholar Ron Becker analyzed \\"Manhood\\" in terms of how it played to the heterosexual majority. By placing the series' protagonists on the pro-gay side, the episode positions the viewers with the small minority of Americans who support gay rights. Stone and Adam Schiff's shock at the verdict is meant to inspire similar incredulity in the viewer and a comparison of the police who left the gay officer to die and the jury that acquitted them to the Ku Klux Klan further encourages the viewer to consider him- or herself enlightened on gay issues. \\"Manhood\\" won a 1993 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Dramatic Television Episode.Tropiano, p. 83 Green and Nathan were nominated for an Emmy Award for their script.

As part of an HBO televised broadcast, the split-site double-header included WBA junior welterweight Championship Amir Khan vs. Paul McCloskey, Khan fighting from his native England. Build Up Berto came off a TKO victory over Freddy Hernandez. Berto successfully defended his WBC welterweight title, stopping Hernandez at 2:07 of the first round. He hammered Hernandez (29-2) with a left hook, then floored him with a straight right during the co-feature fight of the Juan Manuel Marquez-Michael Katsidis lightweight championship bout. While Ortiz's last battle ended up being a draw against Lamont Peterson that could have delay that desire on the Amir Khan-Marcos Maidana junior welterweight title fight undercard. Peterson went down for the first time from a right hand that finished a four-punch combination. Peterson got up quickly and did not appear hurt. But he was moments later from another punch and he grabbed on to Ortiz as they tumbled to the mat. Whether Ortiz had a good or bad performance on December 11, there's no doubt that both Andre Berto and Victor Ortiz are two of the hottest prospects in any division. Both rapper 50 Cent and #2 P4P boxer in the world Floyd Mayweather, Jr. were sitting in ring side. Negotiations The fight was sanctioned as a world title fight in the welterweight division, where the weight limit is 147 pounds. However, Berto's camp agreed to fight at a catchweight of \\"145 pounds plus one\\" to accommodate Ortiz, who was moving up from the 140 lb division. The fight Although Ortiz was the fighter moving up in weight, on fight night he was 161 on HBO's unofficial scale while Berto was 156. At Friday's weigh in, Ortiz weighed in at the contracted catchweight of 146 pounds, while Berto weighed 145.5. Ortiz outpointed Andre Berto to take Berto‚Äôs welterweight title. Ortiz took the fight to Berto (27-1, 21 KOs) from the beginning and almost never let up. Berto fired back throughout the fight but wasn't able to fully cope with the challenger‚Äôs relentless pressure and hard, accurate punches. The knockdowns started almost immediately, Ortiz sending Berto down to one knee‚Äîand hurting him‚Äîwith a combination in the first round. Berto returned the favor in the second with a right to the chin, forcing Ortiz to touch the canvas with his glove. Ortiz won the next three rounds by continuing to fire punches, many of which landed. Again, Berto punched back but couldn‚Äôt keep pace. In the sixth round, Ortiz dropped his left hand and Berto landed a huge right about two minutes into the round, putting Ortiz on his back. Ortiz survived and put Berto down with a short left with a few seconds remaining in the round. Ortiz controlled the remainder of the fight as he had most of the first six rounds, pounding Berto inside with hard shots to the body and head as Berto failed to keep up. On April, 2016, the pair had a rematch, with Berto reversing his loss to Ortiz by way of a fourth-round technical knockout win.

The 1st, 2nd and 4th Squadrons are inactive. The 3rd Squadron is assigned to the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division. History The 61st Cavalry traces its lineage to the 601st Tank Destroyer Battalion. The 601st was activated 19 August 1941 and deployed to England on 2 August 1942. In North Africa, the battalion participated in the battles of Ousseltia Valley, Sbeitla, Kasserine Pass, Mateur, and El Guettar, for which it was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for destroying 37 tanks in 24 hours. The battalion conducted its first amphibious assault at Salerno on 9 September 1943, with the 36th Infantry Division and 1st Ranger Battalion. It fought through Salerno until 30 September 1943. The 601st conducted its second amphibious assault at Anzio Beachhead where they destroyed 42 enemy tanks and countless enemy personnel. In Southern France, SSG Clyde Choate of C Company, 601st Tank Destroyer Battalion was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions near the town of Bruy√©res, France, on 25 October 1944. During the 16-day battle at Colmar, the battalion succeeded in destroying 18 enemy tanks and dozens of enemy fortifications. The 601st was awarded its second Presidential Unit Citation for the battalion's actions and valor. In intense fighting outside of Colmar, Second Lieutenant Audie Murphy earned the Medal of Honor by single-handedly defeating a German attack atop a 601st M10 Tank Destroyer. During the latter days of the German campaign, the 601st Reconnaissance Company ranged far ahead of the advancing US forces. It helped keep the disorganized remnants of the German army within the allied zone of advance from consolidating and re-organizing. The 601st earned 10 campaign streamers in WW II and 2 Presidential Unit Citations. After brief occupation duties in Europe, the 601st Tank Destroyer Battalion was deactivated. On 16 August 2004, 1st Squadron 61st, Cavalry Regiment was activated as part of the 4th BCT, 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. The activation was part of the Army‚Äôs transformation towards a modular force. In November 2005, the 1st Squadron 61st Cavalry Regiment deployed to Operation Iraqi Freedom. The squadron was assigned an area of responsibility in southeast Baghdad that consisted of over 1,500 square kilometers and over 1 million people. The AO included the restive towns of Jisr Diyala and Salman Pak, as well as several areas where the enemy had been quite active since 2003. The squadron conducted over 1,000 combat patrols and executed numerous raids and search and attack operations. Soldiers of the 1st Squadron 61st Cavalry found and cleared over 200 improvised explosive devices as well as numerous caches. The squadron detained over 200 insurgents including over 20 division-level high-value targets. The soldiers of the squadron also permanently removed many insurgents from the fight. The squadron had the highest number of detainees sentenced to long-term incarceration and highest number of high-value individuals killed or captured for a battalion-sized unit for all of Multi-National Division - Baghdad. Beginning in 2007, there were no more RSTA battalions in the US Army, only cavalry units. So, the 1-61 CAV included C Company in 2004‚Äì07, which was changed to C Troop (dismounted cavalry) in 2007; A Troop and B Troop remained mounted cavalry.

He was also the founder of Kelly & Co. (later Kelly's Directories Ltd.), which published the Kelly's Directory, a sort of Victorian-era \\"Yellow Pages\\" that listed all businesses, tradespeople, local gentry, landowners, charities, and other facilities located in a particular village, city or town. In many sources, both contemporary and modern, his name is spelled Frederick. He should not be confused with his identically-named eldest son. Inspector of Letter Carriers He began working for the Post Office in 1819. In 1835 or 1836 he became a chief inspector of letter carriers. His exact title varied over the years because in the early 19th century there were three separate services with separate corps of letter-carriers: twopenny-post (for mail within London; renamed the London District Post Office in 1844); inland (for domestic mail outside London); and foreign (for overseas mail). Although the foreign letter-carriers had been abolished by 1835, with their duties carried out by the other two services, the (by then renamed) General Post and London District letter-carriers remained separate until 1855, with separate chief inspectors. Before that date, Kelly was inspector of only the inland or general-post letter carriers. Kelly lost his government post in 1860 when the office of Inspector-General of Letter Carriers was abolished. Post Office Directory When he began his job as inspector of letter-carriers, Kelly took over the production of the Post Office London Directory. This directory had been started in 1799 by two inspectors of letter-carriers named Sparke and Ferguson, with the approval of the then joint Postmasters General, Lords Auckland and Gower. This date was later the basis for the claim \\"Kelly's Directories Ltd., established 1799\\" sometimes printed on the front cover of a Kelly's Directory, although this preceded Mr. Kelly's involvement by several decades. The first edition had been called \\"The New Annual Directory; for the Year 1800\\", but in 1801 the name had changed to \\"The Post-office annual directory\\". Another inspector, Benjamin Critchett, joined in 1803; Sparke and Ferguson dropped from the list of authors in 1806 and Critchett and took over publication (in co-authorship with William Woods between 1810 and about 1827); the name changed to \\"Post Office London Directory\\" in the mid-1810s. Critchett died in September 1836, and when Kelly took over his post, he had to purchase the copyright of the directory from Critchett's widow. The directory was in effect a private enterprise, although produced with the patronage of the Post Office and using labour of government-employed letter carriers as gatherers of data and as a sales force, something that Critchett's private-sector competitors had petitioned against in vain. In 1845‚Äì1847, Kelly was sharply criticised by some members of Parliament, particularly Thomas Duncombe, and accused of using his office for his private benefit and for requiring letter- carriers to assist in gathering information for the directory. Duncombe also presented a petition from Jonathan Duncan complaining of abuses by Kelly. In 1847, the Chancellor of the Exchequer Charles Wood declared that Kelly could not use government employees in connection with his directory. Kelly then relied on his own employees to collect information for the directory, which he had already begun hiring in 1844. Expansion Working with family members, including his brother Edward Robert Kelly, and William Kelly who ran the printing press, Frederic Kelly expanded his directories to include cities and towns other than London, beginning in 1845. Over the rest of nineteenth century, his company bought out or put out of business several rival publishers of directories. The company branched into other publications, such as the Handbook to the Titled, Landed and Official Classes (1875). Well after Frederic Kelly's death, the company name Kelly and Co. was replaced by the new company Kelly's Directories Limited in 1897. Even after leaving his position at the post office, Kelly retained the copyright of the directory and continued to use the name \\"Post Office Directory\\"; his company even tried to claim exclusive rights to use \\"Post Office\\" in the name of a directory but lost the court case it brought over this issue (Kelly v. Byles, in 1879‚Äì80). Kelly was also the plaintiff in the 1866 case Kelly v. Morris, accusing a competitor of pirating his compilation of information. Family A dearth of biographical information was noted by a contemporary biographer of Men of the Time Frederic Kelly is listed in Men of the Time, fifth (1862) through eighth (1872) editions, but not the ninth (1875) and subsequent editions. However, in the Journal of the Galway Archeological and Historical Society, E. Festus Kelly traces the family back to the original O'Kelly. He was the son of Festus Kelly (c. 1759 ‚Äì 7 October 1831) country Galway, formerly a captain in the 96th Regiment of Foot. His brother Edward Robert Kelly is recorded as being born in 1817 and the 4th son of Colonel Festus Kelly of Middlesex. He resided at Chessington Lodge and at 32, Bedford Square, London; at his death his residence was given as Oakhurst, Castlebar Hill, Ealing. He married Harriet, daughter of John Richards of Maida Vale. His elder son was the Rev. Frederic Festus Kelly, vicar of Camberwell, Surrey (1838‚Äì1918), whose children (his grandchildren) included the painter Sir Gerald Festus Kelly and Rose Edith Kelly, who married Aleister Crowley. His second son was the barrister and politician John Richards Kelly, who inherited his share and interests in the copyright of the Post Office Directory. His elder daughter Harriet married the Rev. Hector Norton, vicar of Great Bentley, on 21 May 1867; his second daughter Fanny married Frederick William Headland on 10 August 1865. There was also a daughter named Rosa.

The STAI measures two types of anxiety ‚Äì state anxiety, or anxiety about an event, and trait anxiety, or anxiety level as a personal characteristic. Higher scores are positively correlated with higher levels of anxiety. Its most current revision is Form Y and it is offered in 40 languages. It was developed by psychologists Charles Spielberger, R.L. Gorsuch, and R.E. Lushene. Their goal in creating the inventory was to create a set of questions that could be applied towards assessing different types of anxiety. This was a new development because all other questionnaires focused on one type of anxiety at the time. Spielberger also created other questionnaires, like the STAI, that assessed other emotions. These are the State-Trait Anger Scale (STAS), State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI), and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC). The STAI can be utilized across a range of socio-economic statuses and requires a sixth grade reading level. It is used in diagnoses, in both clinical and other medical settings, as well as in research and differentiating between anxiety and depression. History Charles Spielberger was not alone in creating the STAI, R.L. Gorsuch, and R.E. Lushene also contributed to its development. It underwent revision to its current form in 1983. It was developed as a method to assess the two types of anxiety, state and trait, in the fields of practice and research. The inventory was developed in a way so that it could be one set of questions that when given the proper direction, could be applied towards the assessment of a specific type of anxiety. Some of the information used in the inventory was taken from other forms of measurement, and in the case of The Affect Adjective Check List (AACL), was even subject to the slight change of its current adjectives. After the inventory had been developed it underwent research to determine if it could be concluded as a valid source of assessment before it could be taken any further. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory The State Trait Anxiety Inventory is a test/questionnaire given to adults that shows how strong a person‚Äôs feelings of anxiety are. It is offered and translated in twelve languages: English, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish, and Thai. It was developed to provide both short and reliable scales based on a person's answers to access state and trait anxiety. Feelings of unease, worry, tension, and stress can be defined as anxiety. It is usually accompanied by a situation that causes these feelings for example, a big test or interview. It can also be caused by anxiety disorders such as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) or Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). The STAI tests two different types of anxiety, state and trait anxiety. State anxiety (S-anxiety) can be defined as fear, nervousness, discomfort, etc. and the arousal of the autonomic nervous system induced by different situations that are perceived as dangerous. This type of anxiety refers more to how a person is feeling at the time of a perceived threat and is considered temporary. Trait anxiety (T-anxiety) can be defined as feelings of stress, worry, discomfort, etc. that one experiences on a day to day basis. This is usually perceived as how people feel across typical situations that everyone experiences on a daily basis. Forms This inventory is made up of 40 questions, and distinguishes between a person‚Äôs state anxiety and their trait anxiety. The two forms of anxiety are separated in the inventory, and both are given their own 20 separate questions. When participants rate themselves on these questions, they are given a 4-point frequency scale. The frequency scales differ between the two types of anxiety. There are two main forms of the Inventory, Form X and Form Y. Form X of the STAI was revised from the original STAI to develop a better way of measuring both state and trait anxieties. This was done in order to better differentiate between patients suffering from anxiety and depressive disorders when being diagnosed. By revising the STAI, many questions from the original inventory were replaced. Form Y of the STAI was constructed by replacing items from Form X. By doing so, Form Y in turn has better defined state and trait anxiety factors. The major difference between Form X and Form Y is that Form Y has a better simple structure, as well as the anxiety factors being better differentiated and stable than Form X. This form of the STAI is currently being used more often than the original Form X. Scoring The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory is one of the first tests to assess both state and trait anxiety separately. Each type of anxiety has its own scale of 20 different questions that are scored. Scores range from 20 to 80, with higher scores correlating with greater anxiety. The creators of this test separated the different anxieties so both scales would be reliable. This means the S-anxiety scale would only measure S-anxiety and the T-anxiety scale would only measure T-anxiety, the ultimate goal in creating this test. They found they could not achieve this if the questions were the same to examine both types of anxiety. Each scale asks twenty questions each and are rated on a 4-point scale. Low scores indicate a mild form of anxiety whereas median scores indicate a moderate form of anxiety and high scores indicate a severe form of anxiety. Both scales have anxiety absent and anxiety present questions. Anxiety absent questions represent the absence of anxiety in a statement like, ‚ÄúI feel secure.‚Äù Anxiety present questions represent the presence of anxiety in a statement like ‚ÄúI feel worried.‚Äù More examples from the STAI on anxiety absent and present questions are listed below. Each measure has a different rating scale. The 4-point scale for S-anxiety is as follows: 1.) not at all, 2.) somewhat, 3.) moderately so, 4.) very much so. The 4-point scale for T-anxiety is as follows: 1.) almost never, 2.) sometimes, 3.) often, 4.) almost always. Uses The various State-Trait tests each evaluate different emotions. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory measures anxiety by assessing someone‚Äôs state and trait anxiety. The STAI was one of the first tests to examine state and trait anxiety at the same time. There are two forms of the STAI, one for children, and for adults. The scale is useful for many different socio- economic backgrounds and groups and anyone that has the equivalence of a sixth grade reading level, it therefore can be utilized for many people. Clinicians use this in diagnosing patients in a clinical setting. It is also used to diagnose clinical anxiety in surgical and other medical patients as well as in mental health patients. The STAI, itself, assesses anxiety but also can be used to make a discrimination when wondering whether a patient is experiencing anxiety or depression. This inventory is used in research projects. Various journal articles have used the STAI in conducting research and comparing different ethnic groups, age groups, etc. regarding anxiety. Additional scales There is also a State Trait Anxiety Inventory for children, or the STAIC. The STAIC distinguishes between how prone a child is to anxious behavior and emotional anxiety. It is very similar to the STAI, and is based on the same concept as the adult measure. This measure is used for children in the upper elementary and junior high school ages, between the ages of 9‚Äì12. It includes two sets of 20 questions, 20 questions for A-State anxiety and 20 questions for A-Trait anxiety, that is easily read, and if needed can be verbally read to younger children. Spielberger also developed a few other scales, the State-Trait Anger Scale, the State-Trait Personality Inventory, and the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory. =State-Trait Anger Scale (STAS)= Anger is an emotional state when feelings can vary in intensity, from irritation, to annoyance, to the extremes of fury or rage. This differs from hostility and aggression in that anger is much less complex than hostility or aggression, while both of these states can include feelings of anger. The STAS is very similar in format to the STAI. However, this scale was formed instead to measure anger as an emotional state and how prone to anger people are. This scale measures both state and trait anger, it is similar to the STAI in assessing state and trait emotions. State anger (S-Anger) is a psychobiological state or condition. This state consists of varying intensities of anger. It is assumed that S-Anger would change over time, based on the situations of the person. Trait anger (T-Anger) is defined by the individual differences in how often that S-Anger was experienced over time. =State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI)= The STAXI provides objective and shortly scored measures of a person‚Äôs experience, expression, and control of anger. It consists of 44 items, which make up 7 scales. These scales measures six components of anger: # S-Anger: 10 questions # T-Anger: 10 questions # AX/In: 8 questions; This measures individual differences in how often feelings of anger are experienced and are held in and not acted on. # AX/Out: 8 questions; This measures individual differences in how often feelings of anger are acted upon towards people or objects. # AX/Con: 8 questions; This measures individual differences in how often a person tries to control their outward expression of anger. # AX/Ex: 24 questions; This provides a general view of how often anger is being experienced and expressed. =Six-item State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6)= There is a short-form version of the state scale, consisting of six items chosen for reliability and validity. It is designed to be administered in circumstances that prohibit the use of the full-form, and produces scores that are comparable to using the full version.

(Reprinted from the Philadelphia Inquirer, February 10, 2008) History The Atlantic City and Shore Railroad, also known as the Shore Fast Line opened in 1906, connecting Atlantic City to Somers Point. In 1907, the line extended into Ocean City, and continued operations until 1946, when the bridge across the Great Egg Harbor Bay burned. On January 18, 1948, service along the Shore Fast Line was discontinued and replaced by a bus line. In the 1970s, cities along the former railroad line began removing the track in the 1970s, and converting into a walking path by adding street lights and stop signs. The portion in Linwood was named after George K. Francis, the city's mayor from 1952 to 1971. The bike path originally existed from Somers Point to southern Linwood. After planning for 10 years, the city of Northfield constructed its bike path in 2000 after receiving a $391,930 grant from the state of New Jersey. On the northern end, the path connects with U.S. Route 30 along local roads in Pleasantville, although the city applied for a grant to build an extension. Pleasantville built portion of its bike path in 2001 at the cost of $178,182 from various grants. The bike path is planned to connect with the newly built bridge along New Jersey Route 52 via Central Avenue, adjacent to Somers Mansion. The state of New Jersey provided a $200,000 grant to extend the path along Central Avenue, with the city of Somers Point covering the remaining $50,000 of the cost. The city applied for another $200,000 grant to finish the project.Landau, J. (n.d.). Bike Paths Lead to Communities Finding Themselves.

Biography=Early life= Kauffman was born on April 11, 1924, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. She moved with her parents to Cuba and was raised in Havana, where she resided until she was 22 years old. She began her entertainment career in Cuba as a child singer at the age of 8, when she thought of becoming an opera singer. Kauffman's parents entered her in a radio contest when she was eleven and a half years old. The contest was looking for a girl to appear on the daily children's radio show, La Escuelita. Kauffman won the contest and began appearing on the radio with the Cuban comic team, Agapito y Timoteo. Kauffman earned her lifelong nickname, Vitola, while working in Cuban radio. Her nickname is based on the vitola of Cuban cigars. =Career= Kauffman transitioned to comedy and moved to Mexico in 1943, shortly before she turned 23 years old. In 2007, Kauffman told the newspaper, El Universal, that though she was raised in Canada and Cuba, she emphasized that, \\"Soy mexicana\\" (I am Mexican), after more than 60 years of residing in the country. She made her Mexican debut at the Teatro Arbeu in Mexico City in 1943. Kauffman met Germ√°n Vald√©s, who was better known as Tin-Tan, while working at the Teatro Arbeu. Kauffman and Tin-Tan developed a close professional relationship which spanned both of their careers. The two often appearing opposite one another on screen and stage. In 1946, Kauffman launched her film career in the 1946 movie, Se acabaron las mujeres, directed by Ram√≥n Pe√≥n. She co-starred in the 1949 Mexican film, El Rey del Barrio, opposite Silvia Pinal and Tin-Tan. Kauffman also starred or appeared in films throughout the Golden Age of Mexican cinema, including the 1950 film, Tambi√©n de Dolor se Canta, starring Pedro Infante and films opposite Adalberto Mart√≠nez. Kauffman married three times, with each marriage ending in divorce. She had four sons and a daughter during her three marriages. Her eldest sons, actor Humberto Elizondo and David, were born during her first marriage to Mexican diplomat, Humberto Elizondo Alardine. Her two other sons from her second marriage, Mois√©s and Abraham, died in separate accidents during the 1980s. Kauffman retired from acting and comedy when she was 72 years old. She explained that she realized she was tired while waiting to go on stage for a performance in New York City. She claimed that she decided to retire on the same day of that particular New York performance. Kauffman also came to believe that audiences no longer laughed at her jokes as they once did earlier in her career. Fannie Kauffman died in the early morning of February 21, 2009, of natural causes at a hospital in Mexico City at the age of 84. Kauffman had been named a recipient of the 2008 Golden Ariel, the highest award in the Mexican film industry, shortly before her death. She was awarded the Ariel Award posthumously. She was survived by three of her five children, including Mexican actor, Humberto Elizondo. Selected filmography *Sinbad the Seasick (1950) * Oh Darling! Look What You've Done!

It is raised off the ground and usually anchored/supported on its shorter length sides by brackets. It can also be held up by columns or pillars. A shelf is also known as a counter, ledge, mantel, or rack. Tables designed to be placed against a wall, possibly mounted, are known as console tables, and are similar to individual shelves. A shelf can be attached to a wall or other vertical surface, be suspended from a ceiling, be a part of a free-standing frame unit, or it can be part of a piece of furniture such as a cabinet, bookcase, entertainment center, some headboards, and so on. Usually two to six shelves make up a unit, each shelf being attached perpendicularly to the vertical or diagonal supports and positioned parallel one above the other. Free-standing shelves can be accessible from either one or both longer length sides. A shelf with hidden internal brackets is termed a floating shelf. A shelf or case designed to hold books is a bookshelf. The length of the shelf is based upon the space limitations of its siting and the amount of weight which it will be expected to hold. The vertical distance between the shelves is based upon the space limitations of the unit's siting and the height of the objects; adjustable shelving systems allow the vertical distance to be altered. The unit can be fixed or be some form of mobile shelving. The most heavy duty shelving is pallet racking. In a store, the front edge of the shelf under the object(s) held might be used to display the name, product number, pricing, and other information about the object(s). Materials Adjustable shelving made from Dexion steel slotted angle Shelves are normally made of strong materials such as wood, bamboo or steel, though shelves to hold lighter-weight objects can be made of glass or plastic. DIY shelves can even be made from an old door, colored pencils or books. Pipe shelving Pipe shelving can be used in a home, business, store or restaurant. It consists mainly of wood boards resting on black or galvanized steel gas pipe. Copper pipe can be used but it is not recommended for heavy duty shelves. Pipe shelving can also be modified to be used as retail clothing displays and wall shelves. Pipe shelving supports rest on the floor with floor flanges (these need not be attached) and attaches to the wall with flanges that are directed backwards. Many different designs exist and some companies make these shelves for commercial and residential applications and others make these shelves as diy projects. Pipe shelving is mainly attached to a wall but some companies have designed free standing units. Pipe shelving has even been used in reclamation projects such as shipping container architecture and was used by Marriott hotels in a bar project. Proportions for hanging on a wall When hanging shelves on a wall, home designers generally try to ensure that the shelf should be no wider than 1.4 x bracket's width and no wider than 1.2 x bracket's height. Spacing brackets for a long shelf should be no more than 4 x shelf-breadth between each bracket - this holds true for normal materials used at home. Length and size of screws holding the shelf to the wall differ depending on the material of the wall. A good rule of thumb for concrete walls is that the screw should go into the wall at least at least as far as 1/10th the width of the shelf. But there are shelf systems where a brace is hung on the wall onto which brackets are attached without screws. Etymology The word shelf is from the Old English scylfe; akin to Low German schelf shelf and Old Norse -skjalf bench.

Early life and career Gene Scott was born in Buhl, Idaho. He earned his Ph.D. in Philosophies of Education at Stanford University in 1957 and subsequently served as an ordained minister for nearly five decades. During his career, Scott served as a traveling teacher for the Pentecostal Assemblies of God, the president of the Full Gospel Fellowship of Churches and Ministers International for nine years and, for a combined total of 35 years, as the pastor for the Protestant Wescott Christian Center and Faith Center. For the last 15 years of his ministry, Scott held weekly Sunday Bible teaching services at the Los Angeles University Cathedral in Los Angeles, California. In 1975, Scott was elected pastor of Faith Center, a 45-year-old church of congregational polity in Glendale, California. Faith Broadcasting Network was the first Christian television station and the first to provide 24-hour Christian programming. Scott added a nightly live television broadcast to the network, the Festival of Faith. In 1983, the University Network began broadcasting the first twenty-four-hour religious television network via satellite to North America and much of Mexico and the Caribbean. Affiliate television and radio stations broadcast Scott's services and nightly teachings. Ministry= Early years = Though raised a minister's son, he rebelled against tradition early in life and became agnostic in college. His search for faith caused him to change majors on every degree. ‚ÄúA hard study of the resurrection of Christ led to a firm faith,‚Äù and Dr. Scott's journey back to faith is laid out in his summation under the title: ‚ÄúA Philosopher Looks at Christ.‚Äù He went on to complete a Ph.D. in Philosophies of Education at Stanford University in 1957; his Doctoral Dissertation dealt with the theology of Reinhold Niebuhr. He taught at Evangel College (now Evangel University), then assisted Oral Roberts in establishing Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma. = Assemblies of God = Scott eventually joined the Assemblies of God, a Pentecostal denomination, and served overseas as a missionary for several years.

(1968), The Message of the Church, p. 7. Focusing on human frailties of Old Testament prophets and New Testament apostles, he concluded that the message of the church (his assigned theme for the occasion) was, \\"the message of a Person--Jesus Christ and Him crucified. It needs to be told from the Word, and it needs to be experienced, and it needs to be seen.\\"Champion et al.

Faith Center owned four broadcast stations: KHOF-TV channel 30 in San Bernardino, California, KHOF-FM 99.5 in Los Angeles, California, KVOF-TV channel 38 in San Francisco, California, and WHCT channel 18 in Hartford, Connecticut. These stations comprised F.B.N., the Faith Broadcasting Network. Broadcasting In 1975, Scott began nightly live broadcasts, and eventually satellite broadcasts extended his services and talk shows to many countries.Austin Chronicle: Print an Article Scott became known as much for his stage persona as he was for his preaching skills. He would fill chalkboards with scriptural passages in the original Greek, Hebrew or Aramaic during his exegesis as to their meanings. During his live fundraising broadcasts, Scott typically stared into the camera and told his viewers to get on the telephone and give if they felt as though the spirit called for it, often wearing one of a variety of hats, such as an English pith helmet or a sombrero. He often played a videotape of The Statesmen Quartet singing the lively hymn \\"I Wanna Know\\" repeatedly to get viewers to contribute. Scott showed disdain for other religious broadcasters like Jerry Falwell and Jimmy Swaggart, and bristled when people referred to him as a televangelist, preferring to be regarded as a teacher and pastor. = Los Angeles University Cathedral = University Cathedral marquee In 1989, Scott was approached by Bruce Corwin, then president of Miracle on Broadway and chairman of the Metropolitan Theatres Corporation, to restore the United Artists flagship theatre in downtown Los Angeles. In 1990, Scott and his congregation moved their Sunday service to the building, which he renamed the Los Angeles University Cathedral. According to the Los Angeles County Recorder's office and North American title report, Scott acquired ownership of the building through his entity the Wescott Christian Center in December 2002. Both the buildingCity of Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument (HCM) Report Entry #523 and the neon \\"Jesus Saves\\" signs are designated historic monuments. Portions of the Dr. Gene Scott Bible Collection containing Bibles, other books, and manuscripts, were formerly held at the building. = University Network = In 1975, Scott began a series of broadcasts which resulted in the creation of the University Network. By 1983, this network was broadcasting his sermons 24 hours a day via satellite to the United States and Canada, as well as to much of Mexico and the Caribbean. By 1990, his network was available to 180 countries, and by 1992 his sermons were being broadcast in several languages on AM, FM and shortwave radio. Drawing from nearly 30 years of recorded programming,Thevolcanodog.com Scott's radio, satellite and television ministry continues to be broadcast, although on different stations and at different times. Notable members of congregation Among Scott's volunteer cadre of telephone-answering \\"Voices of Faith\\" was Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman Wes Parker. During a 1982 broadcast (index number S-1086-3), Parker spoke with Scott publicly for over 20 minutes, stating that before coming across Scott's television program, he had never understood or felt drawn toward Christianity. He said that it was Scott's intelligent and fact-based approach to teaching that earned his respect and allowed him to build faith. He also said that his earlier exposures to Christianity had had no effect, because they were mostly based on simplistic platitudes such as \\"God is love\\" which he found unconvincing. Actor Don DeFore was also a member of his congregation. Continuing broadcast presentation During the years following Scott's death, his surviving wife and successor, Pastor Melissa Scott, has purchased many hours of time over broadcast, cable, and satellite television for the presentation of one-hour programs of his messages from his later years, as well as many recent lectures by herself from Faith Center. Still available are the 24-hour satellite, internet, and shortwave radio broadcasts, carrying the raw network feed, featuring three decades of Scott's recorded teachings. Starting in 2005, Melissa Scott led the Los Angeles church until it was sold, and she now leads the Glendale church. She is seen weekly on her own national television broadcast. She refers to Scott as her mentor.Dr. Gene Scott's Bio on Pastor Melissa Scott.com Posthumous publication of writings As of Oct. 14, 2019, 14 volumes of \\"The Dr. Gene Scott Pulpit\\" have been published by Dolores Press for Pastor Melissa Scott.

Previous attempts  Folsom prison saw numerous escape attempts; the first one occurring shortly after the first inmates arrived in the 1880s, and the most recent in 2010. There were several escapes before this attempt, as well as after. Throughout Folsom's violent and bloody history, numerous riots and escape attempts have resulted in both inmate and staff deaths.  Attempt  Approximately 40 inmates had been waiting to talk to Warden Larkin concerning upcoming parole hearings when seven of the inmates suddenly attacked him. As they took him into the yard, guards started firing. In the commotion that followed Officer Martin and Warden Larkin were both stabbed to death. Officer Martin died at the scene and Warden Larkin died of his wounds five days later. The inmates involved in the attack were said to have used shanks, prison-made knives, to attack the Warden and the officer. Also, a prison-made wooden semiautomatic pistol, carved and meant for use in the attack, was found. One of the seven inmates who attempted to escape was Ed Davis, a notable prisoner, and he was wanted for the murder of Officer James Hill, of the Marlow, Oklahoma, Police Department, on April 20, 1931.Newton, Michael.

He studied art at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, bringing back ideas from the Munich Secession movement to Zagreb. He is best known for his work in public and government buildings in Zagreb, and paintings in churches in his native Slavonia in north-east Croatia.  Biography  Ivan Ti≈°ov was born in the village of Vi≈°kovci near ƒêakovo. He attended elementary school in the village, and continued his education at the School of Crafts in Zagreb. He attended the School of Applied Arts in Vienna, and received a scholarship to the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich. From 1895, he was a vocational teacher, and professor of painting and drawing at the Academy of Fine Arts, Zagreb where he worked for the rest of his life. \\"Worship\\" (Bogo≈°tovlje) by Ivan Ti≈°ov on the ceiling of the Croatian Institute of History (Hrvatskom institutu za povijest) in Zagreb While he was still studying in Vienna, Ti≈°ov received a commission to paint four allegorical works on the ceiling of the Golden Hall in Zagreb, under the titles of worship, theology, art and science. With his picture of Art, also known as Music, Ti≈°ov won a bronze medal at the Millennium Exhibition in Budapest in 1896. Ti≈°ov painted many portraits, working directly with brush, without sketches and drawings achieving an amazing likeness. He painted his wife Ana Neuh√§user, Vladimir Vidriƒá, Grga Martiƒá and many others. By the end of the century, Ti≈°ov's painting showed the influence of Vlaho Bukovac. His pictures became darker with contrasting yellow, blue and green. Themes were taken from his native Slavonia, such as the painting \\"Under the Maple\\" (Pod javorom) which is one of his most beautiful works. In later years, folklore would replace mythology. In addition, Ti≈°ov worked on wall paintings in Kri≈æevci and Bjelovar, in St. Catherine and other churches. He spent a year (1913‚Äì1914), training in Paris at the Acad√©mie Julian, to prepare for making decorations in the University Library in Zagreb. He died in Zagreb on 20 September 1928.  Legacy  Ivan Ti≈°ov's paintings of worship, theology, art and science decorate the ceilings in the Croatian Institute of History in Zagreb. Although largely in the shadow of the other greats of Croatian art at the time (primarily Vlaho Bukovac, his work has an essentially timeless quality. He was a skilled colourist, and his work contains originality of composition, yet lacks the freedom of expression that marks other contemporary painters. However, as much of his painting was large government orders, and for the church - altar paintings in the Roman Catholic Church, the Orthodox Iconostasis of the Church of Saint Nicholas in Paƒçetin, the foyer ceiling of the Croatian National Theatre, and the \\"Golden Hall\\" building of the Department of Religion and Education of the Government of Zagreb - that should not be too surprising. His paintings mark the late classical period and its transition towards secession style in painting.

St Jude celebrates Qurbono in Malayalam and English and serves members of the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church in the Delaware Valley.  History  The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, paved the way for many Indians to immigrate into the US. During the early 1970s many Malankara Catholics began to migrate to the US and settle in different parts of the country. Many of them choose Philadelphia as their new home town, but Malankara Liturgical Services were not available A Malankara community became possible when Benedict Mar Gregorios OIC, the Archbishop of Trivandrum and the head of the Malankara Catholic Hierarchy, visited United Stare of America and Canada in August, 1982 and established prayer groups in major North American cities. Regular prayer meetings were held at the residence of members and Holy Masses were celebrated as and when Malankara priests were available. The presence of Ignatius Thangalathil OIC, a Malankara missionary priest on special assignment in New York, helped in the formation of a Malankara Community in early 1983. The subsequent visits of the Archbishop in 1993 and 1994 helped the community. Then the Malankara Catholic Mission of North America was inaugurated in New York in 1984. In March 1985, Archbishop Mar Gregorios, in consultation with John Cardinal Krol, Archbishop of Philadelphia, appointed John Kalloor (now Yoohanon Mar Chrysostom) as pastor of the Malankarites in Philadelphia and Washington. The Malankara Catholic Community in Philadelphia then had regularly scheduled Malankara Liturgy celebrated at Incarnation of Our Lord Church. While organizing the community, Fr. Kalloor initiated the Malankara Catholic Youth Movement (MCYM), which became the cornerstone of building of the parish. Varghese Edathil, the successor of Fr. Kalloor, took charge of the community on March 30, 1987. He served as an associate pastor of the Incarnation and spiritual director of the Malankara faithful. Malankara Children‚Äôs League was inaugurated for youngsters, and religious instruction classes were initiated. At the urging of Mar Gregorios, Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, Archbishop of Philadelphia, officially established the Malankara Catholic Mission of Philadelphia on May 2, 1988. Fr. Alexander Panamkunil was the successor of Fr. Varghese and took charge as the Associate pastor of Incarnation and spiritual director of Malankara Catholics in October 1991. Geevarghese Mar Timotheos, Bishop of Thiruvalla and Cyril Mar Baselious visited the community. In April 1995, Rev. John Kalloor succeeded Fr. Alexander as the parochial vicar of Incarnation church and spiritual director of the Malankara Catholic Mission. Two family conferences of the Malankaraites of the Eastern regions, (New York, New Jersey, Washington and Philadelphia) were conducted at Philadelphia (1993, 1995) to discuss and evaluate issues pertaining to Malankaraite life in the US. The second Family conference was directed by Mar Thimotheos. 21st century The name \\"St Jude\\" was chosen by Archbishop of Tiruvilla Thomas Mar Koorilos. On October 31, 2008, the current site of the parish was purchased. St Jude Syro Malankara Catholic Church consists of 85 families with over 300 members. Holy Qurbono, prayer meetings, and Malankara Qurbono are held in English. Sunday School classes are held before Sunday Mass. There was a YMCL (Young Malankara Catholic League), later discontinued and merged with Sunday School, consisting of 38 youngsters between the ages of 7 and 20. Altar servers are trained to carry on the Malankara Liturgy; they take turns in serving.  Vicars  *Rev. Fr. John Kalloor (Yoohanon Mar Chrysostom) (1983‚Äì1987) *Rev. Fr.

He is best remembered as a radio broadcaster on medical subjects, particularly on The Body Program for ABC which he wrote and presented from 1971 to 1982. He was the author of a number of books based on those programmes, and several biographies for the Australian Dictionary of Biography. History Hackett was born in Cork, Ireland, son of a successful general practitioner. He was the founding chairman of the Irish National Blood Transfusion Service. He migrated to Adelaide, South Australia in 1958 to take up a position as deputy director of the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science (IMVS) at the University of Adelaide. Broadcasting As a distraction from his administrative duties, he sent some scripts to Dr. Peter Pockley, director of science programs for the ABC, which resulted in five talks on \\"blood\\" for the radio science program Insight commencing January 1967. His weekly \\"The Body Program\\" running from 1971 to 1982, was well received, with its amalgam of medical information, poetry, wit, irreverence and bawdiness, all delivered with Hackett's friendly cultured voice. Scripts from many of these programs have formed the basis of several books published by the ABC and elsewhere. An mp3 download of his final broadcast is available here Science Show tribute. He had resigned from the IMVS to further his interests in broadcasting and other ventures, including a (failed) private blood bank. Other interests He was at various times chairman of the board of the Art Gallery of South Australia, chairman of the Crafts Council of South Australia and president of the College of Pathologists of Australia. He was appointed to the ABC board in 1973, became deputy chairman in 1974, then acting chairman on 10 November 1975, when Professor Richard Downing died of a heart attack. This was the day before the overthrow of the Whitlam government and Hackett was to prove a staunch defender of the ABC in the face of budget cuts by the succeeding Fraser Coalition government. His stint as acting chairman lasted only six months: he was summarily dismissed and replaced by Sir Henry Bland.Williams, Robyn And Now For Something Completely Different p.244 Viking (imprint of Penguin Books) 1995 Personal life Hackett married a nurse, Eileen Carroll, born in Swaziland of Irish parents.

His father died when he was 8 or 9 years old, and since his mother had already died, he was adopted by his paternal uncle, U.S. Congressman Daniel Sheffey (1770-1830), a Federalist and lawyer who had moved to Staunton. Hugh Sheffey entered Yale College at the end of the freshman year, after his uncle's death. Graduating in 1835, Hugh Sheffey taught for a few years in Southside Virginia, as well as read law with the Hon. Thomas S. Gholson in Brunswick. Hugh was the middle of five brothers. His eldest brother Daniel Henry Sheffey (1812-1871) was blind and traveled extensively with a black companion; his next eldest brother Dr. James White Sheffey Sr. (1813-1876) remained in southwest Virginia, became a delegate to the Virginia Secession Convention of 1861 and later the Virginia House of Delegates; his younger brother Dr. Lawrence Brengeler Sheffey Sr. (1818-1866) practiced in Huntsville, Alabama; his youngest brother Robert Sayers Sheffey (1820-1902) became a prominent and idiosyncratic circuit-riding Methodist evangelist in Appalachia.

Their marriage lasted more than four decades and they had at least two daughters: Sara Louisa Sheffey (b. 1850): and Margaret (Maggie) Sheffey (b. 1851).Sara Louisa had left the household by the 1880 census. The household included had 4 servants in 1880, but 3 in the 1870 census. Unlike previous censuses, 28 year old Maggie Sheffey was listed as a niece rather than a daughter in 1880, and as having been born in West Virginia. Widowed, Louisa Sheffey survived her husband by less than a month. In 1877 Washington and Lee University awarded Hugh Sheffey an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws; his alma mater did likewise in 1880. Career In 1840 Sheffey began practicing law in Staunton.

However, there are some intriguing parallels between the movie and the later civil war, particularly the similarities between the fictional General Dittling and the real-life Generalissimo Francisco Franco. During the war, Franco was part of the Spanish Confederation of Autonomous Right-wing Groups. He later became the dictatorial ruler of Spain. In 1969, in a surprise move, the monarchist-leaning Franco designated Prince Juan Carlos de Borb√≥n as his successor. When Franco died in 1975, he was indeed succeeded by the prince as King Juan Carlos I. ReferencesBibliography * Sutton, David R. A chorus of raspberries: British film comedy 1929-1939.

The malfunction is expected to setback the program with DRDO going back to the drawing board. Development The Advanced Towed Artillery Gun System (ATAGS) project was started in 2013 by DRDO to replace older guns in service in the Indian Army with a modern 155mm artillery gun. DRDO laboratory Armament Research and Development Establishment (ARDE) partnered with private players Bharat Forge Limited, Mahindra Defence Naval System, Tata Power Strategic Engineering Division and public sector unit Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) for this purpose. The development of the gun took about 4 years and is expected to be complete by March 2017. The delay in completion of the project was attributed to realization of ordnance and recoil system and supply issue with manufacturing of sub-systems. The gun is expected to start user trials in 2017 and production is expected to start in 2019. It was first publicly showcased at 68th Republic Day parade on 26 January 2017.  Design  The gun consists of a barrel, breech mechanism, muzzle brake and recoil mechanism to fire 155 mm calibre ammunition with a firing range of 48 km.

He also played internationally for the England Futsal side. He was most recently the assistant manager at Redditch United. Career Sykes was a product of the youth setups at both Hereford United and Mansfield Town. He had originally begun his career with Westfields who received a club record fee of ¬£4,000 from Mansfield for his services in 1992. He made his senior debut for Mansfield in a Football League match against Walsall, scoring on his debut. He turned down the offer of a new contract from manager Andy King to attend university in Cheltenham at the University of Gloucestershire. During this time he played for defunct Hellenic League club Endsleigh, and also for the reserves at Cheltenham Town. He signed for Forest Green Rovers in March 1996 and was part of their successful double league winning side that won back-to-back promotions into the Football Conference in 1998 under Frank Gregan. In 1999, Sykes reached the final of the FA Trophy with Forest Green at Wembley Stadium but the club lost 1‚Äì0 against Kingstonian. He finished as top goal scorer in the competition that season and scored in the semi final second leg against St Albans City. He then joined fellow Conference side Nuneaton Borough, ruling out the opportunity to sign for Stevenage Borough. His first goal for Nuneaton Borough came on 28 August 2000 in a 4‚Äì2 away defeat against Morecambe. He helped the club to an FA Cup giant killing against Stoke City however he returned to Forest Green on loan in March 2001 until the end of the season. He made 7 appearances on loan back at Forest Green scoring 2 goals, the first of which again came against Morecambe in April 2001. He missed the club's 2001 FA Trophy final defeat against Canvey Island at Villa Park because he had been cup tied from playing for Nuneaton in a previous round. Sykes returned to Nuneaton for the 2001‚Äì02 campaign but re-joined Forest Green permanently under the management of former England international Nigel Spink in January 2002. This was a swap deal with Lee Howey moving the other way. His two final goals for Nuneaton Borough came in one match on 18 September 2001 when his brace helped Nuneaton to a point in an away game against Doncaster Rovers. He made his third debut for the club in a 1‚Äì1 away draw against Dagenham & Redbridge on 19 January 2002. In November 2002, he featured in Forest Green's 0-0 FA Cup first round draw with Exeter City which was broadcast live on Match of the Day.

It is located on the banks of the Godavari River at the city of Nanded in the state of Maharashtra, India. The gurdwara within the complex is known as Sach-Khand (Realm of Truth). The structure is built at the place where Guru Gobind Singh left his earthly life. The inner room of the gurdwara is called the Angitha Sahib and is built over the place where Guru Gobind Singh was cremated in 1708. The gurdwara was built between 1832 and 1837 by order of Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1780‚Äì1839). History Aarti prayers in Hazur Sahib Nanded Hazur Sahib marks the site where Guru Gobind Singh had his camp in 1708. The Guru held his court and congregation here and was convalescing after being attacked by two would-be assassins. One of the attackers stabbed the Guru, and was killed by him with a single stroke of his talwar (curved sword). The other was killed by his followers as he tried to escape. The Guru's wound was deep, but initially healed after being stitched by an English surgeon sent by Bahadur Shah I, who served as his doctor, and Dara Shikoh before him.http://satguru.weebly.com/european-surgeon-who-attended-satguru-gobind- singh-in-1708.html However the wound re-opened a few days later when the Guru was stringing a bow for one of his Sikhs and the Guru merged into the Primal (Joti Jot) after declaring the Guru Granth Sahib as his successor. The Sikhs built a room over the platform where Guru Gobind Singh would sit while holding his court and installed the Guru Granth Sahib on it. They called it Takhat Sahib. Guru Gobind Singh, while conferring Guruship on the holy Book, had himself named Nanded as \\"Abchalnagar\\" (literally \\"Steadfast city\\") after the first word of a hymn read at random on the occasion. In October 2008, the 300th-anniversary celebration of the Guruship of Guru Granth Sahib took place here. This site is now one of five Takhats which are places of primary importance to the Sikhs. The other four takhats are: Akal Takhat at Amritsar, Takhat Keshgarh Sahib at Anandpur, Takhat Patna Sahib in Bihar and Takhat Damdama Sahib in Talwandi Sabo, Bhatinda, Punjab. Sachkhand (literally \\"region of Truth\\") had been used by Guru Nanak to mean the abode of God. Ranjit Singh had the present building of the Takhat Sahib constructed with money, artisans, and labor sent from Punjab during the early 1830s. Around the same time, the Nizam of Hyderabad State a Muslim ruler of the Deccan Region raised a contingent of Northern Sikhs as part of his army. Most of these men settled permanently in Hyderabad State and also devout Hindus of the Deccan embraced Sikhism in the 19th century. Hindus also have high regard for the Guru Gobind Singh and gurudwara. The control of Takhat Sachkhand Sri Hazoor Sahib, which had formerly passed into the hands of Udasi Sikh priests was regained by the Sikhs under the influence of the Singh Sabha Movement of the late nineteenth century. Some of the 'rituals and ceremonies connected with working' are peculiar to this Takhat Sahib. In 1956 an Act was passed by the legislature of Hyderabad under which the management of the Takhat Sahib and other historical Gurdwaras was legally placed under a 17-member Gurudwaras Board and a five- member Managing Committee. The Takht houses both the Sri Guru Granth Sahib ji and the Sri Dasam Granth. This follows the pattern of Takht Sri Patna Sahib. Nanded is the holy city where Baba Banda Singh Bahadur had his ashram and Baba Banda Singh started his journey of Khalsa victory from Nanded only, has a very high place in the national history of India. This shrine differs from other historical places of Sikh worship, here all ancient customs which were practised at the time of the Guru are still practiced, for example, sandal- wood tilak is still applied on the foreheads of priests and local devotees. The most important aspect of this holy shrine is that there are two sanctum sanctorum here. While all the functions are carried out by the priests in the outer room, the inner room is a vault which houses priceless objects, weapons and other personal belongings of the Guru. No one except the head priest can enter this holy vault.http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020427/windows/site.htm Panorama view of Hazur Sahib Nanded 300th anniversary celebrations In 2008, the 300th Gurudomship ceremony of Guru Granth Sahib and 300th Joti Jot anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh were celebrated on a grand scale at Hazoor Sahib, Nanded.
