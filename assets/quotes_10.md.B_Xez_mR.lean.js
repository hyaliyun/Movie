They are most often a consequence of portal hypertension, commonly due to cirrhosis; people with esophageal varices have a strong tendency to develop severe bleeding which left untreated can be fatal. Esophageal varices are typically diagnosed through an esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Pathogenesis banding, showing ulceration at the site of bandingleft The upper two thirds of the esophagus are drained via the esophageal veins, which carry deoxygenated blood from the esophagus to the azygos vein, which in turn drains directly into the superior vena cava. These veins have no part in the development of esophageal varices. The lower one third of the esophagus is drained into the superficial veins lining the esophageal mucosa, which drain into the left gastric vein, which in turn drains directly into the portal vein. These superficial veins (normally only approximately 1 mm in diameter) become distended up to 1‚Äì2 cm in diameter in association with portal hypertension. Normal portal pressure is approximately 9 mmHg compared to an inferior vena cava pressure of 2‚Äì6 mmHg. This creates a normal pressure gradient of 3‚Äì7 mmHg. If the portal pressure rises above 12 mmHg, this gradient rises to 7‚Äì10 mmHg. A gradient greater than 5 mmHg is considered portal hypertension. At gradients greater than 10 mmHg, blood flowing through the hepatic portal system is redirected from the liver into areas with lower venous pressures. This means that collateral circulation develops in the lower esophagus, abdominal wall, stomach, and rectum. The small blood vessels in these areas become distended, becoming more thin- walled, and appear as varicosities. In situations where portal pressures increase, such as with cirrhosis, there is dilation of veins in the anastomosis, leading to esophageal varices. Splenic vein thrombosis is a rare condition that causes esophageal varices without a raised portal pressure. Splenectomy can cure the variceal bleeding due to splenic vein thrombosis. Varices can also form in other areas of the body, including the stomach (gastric varices), duodenum (duodenal varices), and rectum (rectal varices). Treatment of these types of varices may differ. In some cases, schistosomiasis also leads to esophageal varices. Histology Axial CT showing esophageal varices in liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension Dilated submucosal veins are the most prominent histologic feature of esophageal varices. The expansion of the submucosa leads to elevation of the mucosa above the surrounding tissue, which is apparent during endoscopy and is a key diagnostic feature. Evidence of recent variceal hemorrhage includes necrosis and ulceration of the mucosa. Evidence of past variceal hemorrhage includes inflammation and venous thrombosis. Prevention X-ray of a person with dilated, snake like varicose veins in their esophagus secondary to pulmonary hypertension. In ideal circumstances, people with known varices should receive treatment to reduce their risk of bleeding. The non-selective Œ≤-blockers (e.g., propranolol, timolol or nadolol) and nitrates (e.g., isosorbide mononitrate (IMN) have been evaluated for secondary prophylaxis. Non-selective Œ≤-blockers (but not cardioselective Œ≤-blockers like atenolol) are preferred because they decrease both cardiac output by Œ≤1 blockade and splanchnic blood flow by blocking vasodilating Œ≤2 receptors at splanchnic vasculature. The effectiveness of this treatment has been shown by a number of different studies. However, non- selective Œ≤-blockers do not prevent the formation of esophageal varices. When medical contraindications to beta-blockers exist, such as significant reactive airway disease, then treatment with prophylactic endoscopic variceal ligation is often performed. Treatment In emergency situations, care is directed at stopping blood loss, maintaining plasma volume, correcting disorders in coagulation induced by cirrhosis, and appropriate use of antibiotics such as quinolones or ceftriaxone. Blood volume resuscitation should be done promptly and with caution. The goal should be hemodynamic stability and hemoglobin of over 8 g/dl. Resuscitation of all lost blood leads to increase in portal pressure leading to more bleeding. Volume resuscitation can also worsen ascites and increase portal pressure. (AASLD guidelines) Therapeutic endoscopy is considered the mainstay of urgent treatment. The two main therapeutic approaches are variceal ligation (banding) and sclerotherapy. In cases of refractory bleeding, balloon tamponade with a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube may be necessary, usually as a bridge to further endoscopy or treatment of the underlying cause of bleeding (ie: portal hypertension). Esophageal devascularization operations such as the Sugiura procedure can also be used to stop complicated bleeding. Methods of treating the portal hypertension include: transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), distal splenorenal shunt procedure, or liver transplantation. Nutritional supplementation is necessary if the person has been unable to eat for more than four days. Terlipressin and octreotide for one to five days have also been used.

He was the first governor of Georgia. He was also a great-grandfather of Martha Bulloch Roosevelt, and great-great-grandfather of Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th President of the United States. Bust of Bulloch at the Washington-Wilkes Historical Museum Early life Bulloch was born in 1730 in Charleston, South Carolina. He was the son of James Bulloch (1701‚Äì1780) and Jean (n√©e Stobo) Bulloch. After receiving his education in Charleston, he began to practice law and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the South Carolina militia. The Bulloch family moved to the Province of Georgia in 1758, where in 1764 Bulloch moved to Savannah. He was elected to the colonial legislature in 1768. Revolution Bulloch was an early supporter of the revolution in Georgia as a member of the Friends of Liberty. He served as President of the 1st and 2nd Provincial Congresses of Georgia, and was a delegate in 1775 to the Continental Congress. There, he won John Adams's praise for his \\"Abilities and Fortitude\\". In the Continental Congress, he was a member of the Secret Committee, which was responsible for gathering war supplies. Speaking to the Provincial Congress, Bulloch said, \\"This is no time to talk of moderation; in the present instance it ceases to be a virtue.\\" Bulloch is also recorded as having been a Freemason in Georgia. His name is listed on the 1779 Masonic rolls of Solomon's Lodge No. 1 at Savannah along with George Walton, John Adam Treutlen, James Jackson, Nathaniel Pendelton, and General Samuel Elbert. Bulloch would have been a signer of the Declaration of Independence, but decided to return to Georgia to aid the revolution there. He wrote to John Adams, \\"Such a series of Victory having attended the American Arms, emboldens us further to trust in Providence, that has so remarkably interposed in our behalf, and we cannot but entertain the most sanguine Hopes, of still preserving our most invaluable Liberties.\\" Adams was disappointed that Bulloch would not be able to sign the Declaration, saying, \\"I was greatly disappointed, Sir, in the information you gave me, that you should be prevented from revisiting Philadelphia.\\" In 1776, Bulloch fought under the command of Colonel Lachlan McIntosh in the Battle of the Rice Boats and the Battle of Tybee Island. On June 20, 1776, he was chosen to be the first President and Commander-in-Chief of Georgia under the state's temporary republican government. When he signed the state constitution on February 20, 1777, his position transferred from president to governor of Georgia. He was thus Georgia's first chief executive under a proper constitutional government, but the third chief executive in all, following the brief tenures of presidents William Ewen and George Walton. Personal life On October 10, 1764, Bulloch was married to Mary De Veaux (1748‚Äì1818), the daughter of Ann (n√©e Fairchild) De Veaux and Col. James De Veaux, a prominent Savannah landowner. Together, they were the parents of: * William Bellinger Bulloch (1777‚Äì1852), who later represented Georgia in the United States Senate. Bulloch died in Savannah while preparing to defend against the British invasion of Georgia in 1777. There is some speculation that he was poisoned, although this has never been proven. His death was a severe blow, as his was the only leadership that united the Whig factions in the troubled young state. He is buried in Savannah's Colonial Park Cemetery. Legacy The gravesite of Archibald Bulloch within Colonial Park Cemetery in Savannah, Georgia. Archibald's great-great-grandson was President Theodore Roosevelt. His great- great-great granddaughter was First Lady of the United States Eleanor Roosevelt. Theodore Roosevelt's son Archibald was named after his ancestor.

It is down- line from London Liverpool Street and is situated between Stratford and . Its three-letter station code is MYL and it is in fare zone 3. The station was opened in 1873 as Maryland Point by the Great Eastern Railway. It was renamed Maryland in 1940. The station is currently managed by TfL Rail. Train services call at Maryland as part of the -Liverpool Street stopping \\"metro\\" service. In the future the TfL Rail service will be re-branded as the Elizabeth line as part of the Crossrail project. Eventually, the Elizabeth line service will be extended beyond Liverpool Street to Paddington and onwards to and Heathrow Airport. History The station was opened by the Great Eastern Railway on its main line out of Bishopsgate on 6 January 1873 with the name Maryland Point. It was fully rebuilt in 1891 when the line capacity was expanded.The Newham Story: Maryland Point Its name was shortened to Maryland on 28 October 1940.\\"News in Brief\\", The Times, 23 October 1940, p. 2. New station buildings, designed by Thomas Bennett, were opened in 1949. Of the four platforms, only the two serving the stopping \\"metro\\" lines are in regular operation, the others being used only when necessary during engineering works or temporary train path diversions. The station is one of the primary rail access points for the residential areas in the north of Stratford and the south of Leytonstone in east London. The area surrounding the station has seen much redevelopment in the 21st century, with ongoing improvements underway related to the nearby Olympic Park. Notably, the \\"twisted clock\\" timepiece/sculpture formerly installed outside Stratford station was relocated to Maryland. Maryland was closed between 27 July and 12 August 2012, during the 2012 Olympic Games, as it would have been unable to cope with the large numbers of spectators who would have used it to access the venues nearby at the Olympic Park. Services The typical off-peak service is of six trains per hour to , and six to . On Sundays the service is reduced to four trains per hour in each direction. The services are currently operated by TfL Rail. Maryland was added to the planned Crossrail route in 2006 after campaigning by Newham Council, the London Transport Users Committee and others. At , the platforms are too short for Crossrail's new trains which will be over in length, and extending the platforms is impossible due to geographical constraints. Crossrail has therefore committed to providing a full service, making use of selective door operation such that doors on some end carriages will not open at Maryland. An agreement was also reached about improving access to the station. Crossrail's precursor TfL Rail took control of the present \\"metro\\" service at the end of May 2015 from Abellio Greater Anglia and the new trains were introduced in June 2017.

The Apostolic Pardon is given by a priest, usually along with Viaticum (i.e. reception of Communion by a dying person, see Pastoral Care of the Sick, USA numbers 184, 187, 195, 201). It is not usually given as part of the sacrament of Anointing of the Sick. However, if the Anointing of the Sick is given with Viaticum, in exceptional circumstances or an emergency, it may be given then. (See Pastoral Care of the Sick, United States numbers 243, 265). According to the Church, a person who is properly disposed by being in the state of grace - i.e., the person has committed no known and unconfessed mortal sins - who receives the Apostolic Pardon gains the complete pardon of all temporal punishment due to sin that has already been forgiven by the reception of absolution and the doing of penance, i.e., a plenary indulgence. The Apostolic Pardon does not forgive sins by the act of absolution; it deals only with the punishment (purgation) due for those sins that have already been sacramentally forgiven. However, the Sacrament of Penance, or Reconciliation, which does forgive sins, is usually administered along with the Apostolic Pardon as a part of the Last Rites. The Church's ritual book on the Pastoral Care of the SickPastoral Care of the Sick, Rites of Anointing and Viaticum uses the term \\"Apostolic Pardon\\" for what elsewhere, for instance in the Enchiridion Indulgentiarum, is called the \\"Apostolic Blessing with attached plenary indulgence\\".Enchiridion Indulgentiarum, \\"Aliae concessiones\\", 12 Priests are urged to impart it to the dying, but if a priest cannot be had, the Church grants a plenary indulgence, to be acquired at the moment of death, to any rightly disposed Christian who in life was accustomed to say some prayers, with the Church itself supplying the three conditions normally required for gaining a plenary indulgence (Confession, Communion and prayers for the Pope's intentions).Edward McNamara, \\"Indulgences at the Point of Death\\", in ZENIT, 15 October 2013Brian Mullady, \\"Repetition of Apostolic Blessing with Plenary Indulgence?\\" Form The current form of the Apostolic Pardon usually takes one of two forms; * Latin: \\"Ego facult√°te mihi ab Apost√≥lica Sede trib√∫ta, indulg√©ntiam plen√°riam et remissi√≥nem √≥mnium peccat√≥rum tibi conc√©do, in n√≥mine Patris, et F√≠lii, + et Sp√≠ritus Sancti.

The First Evil first appeared in the third season episode \\"Amends\\", and became the main antagonist of the seventh and final season. A being manifested from all evil in existence, the First is an incorporeal entity that can assume the appearance of any person who has died (however briefly)- including vampires and humans who have been resurrected. Over the course of the series, and depending upon its audience, it takes various guises as a method of deception and manipulation - for example, the First usually appears as Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) to the Slayer and her allies, but it also assumes the forms of Warren Mears, Spike, Drusilla and Jonathan Levinson on multiple occasions, among a variety of other forms taken less frequently. Its only real weakness is that it is non-corporeal, and can therefore not do real physical damage. It is, however, expert at psychological manipulation, and can act through its servants, such as the Bringers, Turok-Han, Caleb or whatever person it can manage to influence. Biography Character history The First Evil claims to be the source and embodiment of all that is evil. For technical purposes, the First Evil is neither male, female, demon, nor god; it is a \\"power\\". The First is older than demons, even the Old Ones, who themselves existed long before the first humans; it is older than the written word, the Big Bang and transcends all realities and dimensions; it is older than any other evil being and may even be the very first entity ever to have existed. It is said that the First lurked in the darkness long before the universe was even created and shall remain long after the universe ends. Few have heard of it and even fewer believe in its existence. The entity cannot affect the world on a physical level. Its power lies in its ability to deceive, torment and manipulate others. It can take the form of anyone who has died (or as an enormous, phantasmic demon with large horns and long, talon-shaped fingers), and it can choose to be seen and heard by just one person or by multiple people. The First has a deep understanding of human nature and it uses this knowledge to drive others to madness, murder and/or suicide. The First makes its initial appearance in the series as a monster of the week that Angel must face in the episode \\"Amends\\". It tries to drive the vampire to kill Buffy by reminding him of his \\"true\\" nature (Angelus) and it sets about accomplishing this by appearing to him as some of his victims: Daniel, Margaret, Travis and Jenny Calendar. It claims that it is responsible for Angel's return from Hell, and suggests that Angel can end his sufferings by turning evil again and killing Buffy, but instead he chooses to kill himself using the sunrise. His suicide is only averted by a freak snowstorm unheard of in Southern California. Episodes of the spin-off series Angel later suggest that Angel was returned from hell and his life saved by divine intervention from the heavenly Powers That Be. Later, the First makes its presence known again in the seventh season by tormenting the vampire Spike, who like Angel has come into possession of a soul; tricking the former villain Andrew Wells into awakening the Hellmouth beneath Sunnydale High; and dispatching its agents, the Bringers, to kill young women around the world with the potential to succeed Faith as the current Slayer. When Buffy's allies Giles and Anya query the First's sudden rise in activity with a mystical third party, they learn that the First is able to act in this way because of an anomaly in the Slayer line caused by Buffy's recent resurrection, providing an outlet for the First to wipe out all the Slayers. Though incorporeal, the First is effective in prompting suicides, deceiving various members of the Buffy's gang, and releasing evil monsters from the Hellmouth. Later in season seven, the audience is introduced to the First's right-hand-man, the supernaturally strong misogynistic ex-priest Caleb, as well as its army of primordial Turok- Han vampires living beneath the Hellmouth. In the series finale, Buffy and her allies take the fight to the First by opening the Hellmouth and using magic to activate every potential Slayer in Buffy's army. With additional help from a magical amulet, the gang destroy the First's army, the Sunnydale Hellmouth, and the surrounding town. Powers and abilities Neither male or female, living or dead, the First is pure power. It is the darkness inside the hearts and souls of all living creatures. While the First has no physical body and is therefore extremely difficult to kill, it also cannot truly interact with the physical world. Certain people are able to interact and even become one with the First, such as Caleb. The First appears in the physical world as dead people, including vampires, humans who have died, and dead people who have been resurrected. This allows the First to impersonate people for the purpose of manipulating others. For instance, the First appears as Warren to get Andrew to kill Jonathan during \\"Lessons,\\" as Eve to more easily attack the Potentials during \\"Showtime,\\" and as Buffy to amplify Spike's torture throughout Season 7. The First seems also to know mannerisms, information and details of the life of whoever it imitates. This is best shown in \\"Conversations with Dead People\\" as the First appears to Dawn as her mother Joyce, appears to Andrew as Warren and appears to Willow as Cassie Newton, in an attempt to manipulate them all into serving its purpose. As essentially the source of all evil, the First has knowledge of every monster and dark ritual in existence. This was exemplified by the runes the Bringers carved into Spike's chest to summon the Turok-Han. As the First is said to be eternal, existing before time and believed to be the only thing remaining after the end of time, it is infinitely patient. A defeat it suffers is nothing more than a minor setback. In Chaos Bleeds, the First displayed the ability to possess people, open portals, teleport beings across dimensions and, according to Sid, conjure a duplicate dummy body for him and trap his soul inside. Appearances The First Evil has appeared in 16 canonical Buffyverse episodes: Buffy the Vampire Slayer' *Season 3 (1998) **\\"Amends\\" (as Daniel, Margaret, Jenny Calendar, and Travis‚Äìname revealed in the shooting scripts). *Season 7 (2002‚Äì2003) **\\"Lessons\\" (as Warren Mears, Glory, Adam, The Mayor, Drusilla, The Master, and Buffy Summers) **\\"Selfless\\" (as Buffy Summers) **\\"Conversations with Dead People\\" (as Warren Mears, Cassie Newton, and Joyce Summers) **\\"Sleeper\\" (as Buffy Summers and Spike) **\\"Never Leave Me\\" (as Buffy Summers, Spike, Warren Mears, and Jonathan Levinson) **\\"Bring on the Night\\" (as Spike and Drusilla) **\\"Showtime\\" (as Buffy Summers and Eve) **\\"First Date\\" (as Jonathan Levinson and Nikki Wood) **\\"Get It Done\\" (as Chloe) **\\"Storyteller\\" (as Warren Mears) **\\"Dirty Girls\\" (as Buffy Summers and Betty) **\\"Empty Places\\" (as Buffy Summers) **\\"Touched\\" (as Richard Wilkins and Buffy Summers) **\\"End of Days\\" (as Buffy Summers) **\\"Chosen\\" (as Buffy Summers and Caleb). The First appears in the non-canonical video game Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Chaos Bleeds as the main antagonist, having helped occultist magician Ethan Rayne escape military confinement to enact a plan for world domination. Buffy and her friends pursue the First over multiple realities and across the centuries, eventually \\"dispersing it across dimensions\\" to stop its plans to consume the universe with evil. Bringers of the First Evil The Bringers of the First Evil, or Harbingers of Death, are the acolytes of the First Evil. They are humans who have been corrupted by the First and undergone rituals that include self-mutilation: their eyes and tongues are removed, and their eyelids covered by rune-like scars; yet they are perfectly aware of their surroundings. It is implied that the First's high priest, Caleb, has played an important role in indoctrinating the Bringers. He possesses extensive knowledge of their habits (such as knowing that they pant instead of sweating) and refers to them as \\"my boys\\". Indeed, The Harbingers of Death themselves refer to him as their \\"teacher\\". The Bringers also have a poisonous aura which is capable of rendering earth and living beings sterile: : For they are the harbingers of death, nothing shall grow above or below them, no seed shall flower, neither in Man nor... Despite their apparent disabilities, Bringers are swift assassins capable of highly organized attacks thanks to their collective consciousness, which is under the control of the First. Besides their deadly fighting skills, Bringers are also capable of summoning manifestations of the First to haunt people, and create psychic links between dreamers through their dark rituals. In season 7, The First declared war on the Slayer line. The Bringers became assassins of Potential Slayers around the world. When the First set up camp in Sunnydale, Bringers begin to swarm the town to hunt down arriving Potentials and to unearth the Scythe, a mystic weapon created by Guardians: ancient, powerful women who cared for the Slayer.

In this serial, the Doctor (Patrick Troughton) and his travelling companion Jamie (Frazer Hines), shortly after losing the TARDIS, are transported to 1866, where the Daleks force the Doctor to help them in their latest plot to implement the human factor into Dalek brains in order to 'humanise' themselves into even deadlier living weapons. This serial marked the debut of Deborah Watling as the Doctor's new companion, Victoria Waterfield. It is also notable for introducing the Dalek Emperor. Only episode two, the episode in which Victoria first appears, is held in the BBC archives; the other six remain missing. Evil was initially intended to be the last Dalek story on Doctor Who. Writer Terry Nation, the creator of the Daleks, was trying to sell the Daleks to American television at the time and it was intended to give them a big send-off from the series. However, this was not to be the Doctor's last encounter with them. Aside from a few cameos, the Daleks did not properly return to the series until Day of the Daleks in 1972. In 1993, readers of DreamWatch Bulletin voted The Evil of the Daleks as the best ever Doctor Who story in a special poll for the series' thirtieth anniversary. Plot In 1966 London, the Second Doctor and Jamie watch helplessly as the TARDIS is loaded onto a lorry and driven away from Gatwick Airport. The trail leads them to an antique shop run by Edward Waterfield, who sells Victorian-style antiques that curiously seem as though they were still new. Waterfield is being coerced by the Daleks, who appear in a secret room of his shop through a time machine, and exterminate his mutinous employee Kennedy. Investigating the store, the Doctor and Jamie succumb to a booby trap that gasses them, and are dragged into the time machine by Waterfield. They wake up to find that they have been transported to 1866, and are in the house of Theodore Maxtible, Waterfield's partner. The two had been trying to invent a time machine using mirrors and static electricity, when the Daleks emerged from their time cabinet. The Daleks then took Waterfield's daughter, Victoria Waterfield, hostage and forced Waterfield to travel a century forward in time to lure the Doctor into a trap by stealing the TARDIS. Waterfield is obviously fearful for his daughter's safety and his own, but Maxtible seems to be cooperating with the Daleks for his own reasons. The Daleks threaten to destroy the TARDIS unless the Doctor helps them by conducting an experiment to isolate the \\"Human Factor\\", the unique qualities of human beings that have allowed them to consistently resist and defeat the Daleks. Once the Doctor has isolated the Human Factor, he will implant it into three Daleks, who will then become the precursors of a race of \\"super\\" Daleks, with the best qualities of humans and Daleks. To that end the Daleks want the Doctor to test Jamie by sending him to rescue Victoria, who is being kept in the house. The Doctor is strangely cooperative with the Daleks, manipulating Jamie into the rescue mission but not telling him of the nature of the test. Jamie manages to rescue Victoria, but she is taken prisoner again and transported through the time cabinet. The Doctor, observing how Jamie accomplished the rescue, distils the Human Factor, but continues to harbour suspicions that there is more to the experiment than just this. Once the Human Factor is implanted in the three Daleks, they become completely human in personality and seem almost childlike, although the Doctor says their mentalities will mature quickly. This was the Doctor's intent all along: that the human factor would lead to \\"human\\" Daleks that would be friendly to humanity. He christens the three Alpha, Beta and Omega, but they soon return through the time cabinet to Skaro, the Daleks' home planet. Meanwhile, Waterfield has discovered that Maxtible has betrayed them all to the Daleks, hoping that he will be able to learn the alchemical secret of transmuting base metals into gold. However, Maxtible, who has travelled to Skaro through the mirror cabinet, is discovering just how ruthless the Daleks are and how empty their promises can be; he is tortured for his failure to bring the Doctor to them. Jamie, Waterfield and the Doctor are locked out of the time cabinet, but manage to use the Daleks' own short-range time machine to make the journey to Skaro before a Dalek bomb destroys Maxtible's house. The trio find their way into the Dalek city and are brought before the imposing Dalek Emperor, who reveals the true reason behind the experiments and the capture of the TARDIS: by isolating the human factor, the Doctor has succeeded in isolating the \\"Dalek Factor\\" as well. The Daleks will use the \\"Dalek Factor\\"‚Äîthe qualities that make the Daleks relentless killing machines‚Äîto reconvert the \\"human\\" Daleks. In addition, the Emperor wants the Doctor to use the TARDIS to spread the Dalek Factor throughout human history, turning all humanity into Daleks. The Doctor knows that the Emperor realises that he would die before complying with this order, and so is concerned about why the Emperor seems so confident. Maxtible is tricked into walking through an archway that infuses him with the Dalek Factor, mentally turning him into a Dalek. He hypnotises the Doctor and lures him through the arch as well, apparently converting him. However, the Doctor is feigning his conversion and secretly plants a device on the arch while the Daleks hunt for the three \\"human\\" Daleks. As one still remains to be found, the Doctor suggests that all the Daleks be put through the conversion arch so that the \\"human\\" Dalek will once again be infused with the Dalek Factor. As the first batch of Daleks go through the arch, the Doctor frees the others. The arch did not work on the Doctor because it was calibrated for humans, and he is not one. The Doctor has also substituted the Human Factor for the Dalek Factor on the arch, so the Daleks that go through will become \\"human\\" and rebel against the Emperor. The Emperor calls out his Black Daleks as the rebellion spreads and the City falls into chaos. Waterfield throws himself in front of a Black Dalek blast meant for the Doctor; the Doctor promises that Victoria will be taken care of, and Waterfield dies content. The Emperor is attacked by the \\"human\\" Daleks. While the Doctor and his companions escape, Maxtible rushes back into the exploding city, screaming of the everlasting glory of the Dalek race. The Doctor tells Jamie that they will be taking the now-orphaned Victoria along on their travels. Jamie, Victoria and the Doctor watch the Dalek City in flames from the top of a hill as the civil war continues. The Doctor pronounces this the end of the Daleks ‚Äì the final end. However a pulsating light is seen coming from the Emperor, indicating that the Dalek is still alive. Production Cast notes Patrick Troughton only appears in pre-filmed insert scenes for the fourth episode, as he was on holiday. Likewise Deborah Watling only appears in a pre-filmed scene in episode three. John Bailey, who played Edward Waterfield, had previously appeared in The Sensorites, and would later appear in The Horns of Nimon. Anneke Wills and Michael Craze were both contracted up to episode 2 of The Evil of the Daleks to appear as Polly and Ben. However, it had been decided during the previous serial that the characters would be dropped; consequently both actors had their contracts paid up and were released after episode 2 of The Faceless Ones. Missing episodes This story was wiped from the BBC's archives in the late 1960s. Episodes 1 to 6 were wiped in August 1968, and episode 7 wiped in September 1969. Only episode 2 remains, in a telerecording found at a car boot sale then returned to the archive in May 1987. In 2004, analysis of the repeated clip used in The Wheel in Space episode six revealed it to be from episode one rather than episode two, as had been long believed. This, however, only constitutes a few frames of recovered footage. The discovery of a behind-the-scenes film, The Last Dalek, made by the special effects team as they worked on the story's conclusion, facilitated a recreation of the climactic battle scenes. This recreation, along with the entire film, have been made available in different forms on various Troughton releases, and has often been used to fill in for the missing climax of Episode 7 on some releases, to give fans an idea of what it looked like when it first aired. In addition, tele-snaps and off-air audio recordings made by fans upon the original broadcasts exist for the entire story. Broadcast and reception Episode is missing The story was repeated in 1968 at the end of Season 5 (08/06/68 to 22/06/68 and 13/07/68 to 03/08/68 allowing for a two-week break for coverage of the 1968 Wimbledon tennis championships) at 5.15pm. At the end of The Wheel in Space, the Doctor used a telepathic display machine to show new companion Zoe Heriot the sort of monsters she would face if she joined the TARDIS crew, and shows a clip from the end of episode 1 of The Evil of the Daleks. Over the following weeks (bridging the gap between Seasons 5 and 6) the entire story was shown, narration over the opening scene of episode 1 reminding viewers of the reason for the repeat. This was the only time any Doctor Who episodes (other than the first episode) were reshown in the 1960s. The repeat viewing figures were 6.3, 5.0, 6.3, 5.0, 5.1, 4.5, 5.2 million viewers respectively. Ironically, Zoe herself would never encounter the Daleks on television; decades later, the Big Finish Productions audio story Fear of the Daleks would tell of an encounter between Zoe and the Daleks, set immediately after the Doctor's telepathic re- run. Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping gave the serial a positive review in The Discontinuity Guide (1995), describing it as \\"a grandiose production which papers over its scientifically implausible aspects with a confident swagger.\\" In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker noted how The Evil of the Daleks played tribute to the series' past, and praised Whitaker's writing and the production values. In 2009, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times awarded it five stars out of five and wrote that the story \\"boasts an intriguing mystery, well-drawn characters, atmospheric settings and thrilling set-pieces\\", though it did have an \\"overly elaborate\\" plot. He particularly praised Jamie, as well as the incidental music. On stage In 2006 the BBC and the Terry Nation estate licensed a charity stage version of the serial. It was adapted and directed by Nick Scovell, who also starred as the Doctor. Production was by Rob Thrush, who provided the Dalek voices, and the orchestral score was by Martin Johnson. The production ran at the New Theatre Royal, Portsmouth between 25 and 28 October 2006, playing to sell-out houses during its five-night run. ¬£15,000 was raised towards the restoration of the theatre, with an additional ¬£550 going to Children in Need. Commercial releases In print Virgin Books published a novelisation of this serial by John Peel in August 1993. To date it is the last serial of the original series to be novelised under the Target Books banner. Afterwards, only two serials (Resurrection of the Daleks and Revelation of the Daleks), due to complex licensing, were unavailable for adaptation until they were both adapted by Eric Saward for BBC Books. In 1994, Science Fiction Chronicles Don D'Ammassa reviewed the novelisation as \\"one of the rarest segments; I'm not even sure the film still exists. That will make it doubly interesting to fans of the series.\\" Home media As with all missing episodes, off-air recordings of the soundtrack exist due to contemporary fan efforts. In 1992 a set was released on audiocassette, accompanied by linking narration from the Fourth Doctor, Tom Baker. However, due to problems with background music clearance the scenes set in the Tricolour in episode one had to be deleted. Subsequently, better quality copies of the soundtrack emerged and in 2003, the remastered soundtrack was re-released with the excised scenes restored (albeit with the song \\"Paperback Writer\\" changed to \\"Hold Tight!\\") and with new narration by Frazer Hines. This CD release contains bonus tracks featuring the end of Episode 7 without narration, raw dialogue and sound effect recordings and the narrated opening to Episode 1 from the 1968 repeat. The serial was originally released on CD in the Doctor Who: Daleks collector's tin, alongside the soundtrack to The Power of the Daleks and a bonus disc featuring My Life as a Dalek, a historical documentary presented by Mark Gatiss; it was re-issued individually in 2004. Hines' narrated version is scheduled for release on vinyl in July 2019. To promote the vinyl release, an exclusive EP of the CD's bonus tracks was bundled with the \\"Deluxe Edition\\" of Doctor Who Magazine issue 539. In 1992, the sole surviving episode was featured in the Daleks: The Early Years VHS. In November 2004, the same episode was released on DVD as part of the Lost in Time box set.

It was proposed by Hugo Steinhaus and proved by Stefan Banach (explicitly in dimension 3, without bothering to automatically state the theorem in the n-dimensional case), and also years later called the Stone‚ÄìTukey theorem after Arthur H. Stone and John Tukey. Naming A ham sandwich The ham sandwich theorem takes its name from the case when and the three objects to be bisected are the ingredients of a ham sandwich. Sources differ on whether these three ingredients are two slices of bread and a piece of ham , bread and cheese and ham , or bread and butter and ham . In two dimensions, the theorem is known as the pancake theorem to refer to the flat nature of the two objects to be bisected by a line . History According to , the earliest known paper about the ham sandwich theorem, specifically the case of bisecting three solids with a plane, is by . Beyer and Zardecki's paper includes a translation of the 1938 paper. It attributes the posing of the problem to Hugo Steinhaus, and credits Stefan Banach as the first to solve the problem, by a reduction to the Borsuk‚ÄìUlam theorem. The paper poses the problem in two ways: first, formally, as \\"Is it always possible to bisect three solids, arbitrarily located, with the aid of an appropriate plane?\\" and second, informally, as \\"Can we place a piece of ham under a meat cutter so that meat, bone, and fat are cut in halves?\\" Later, the paper offers a proof of the theorem. A more modern reference is , which is the basis of the name \\"Stone‚ÄìTukey theorem\\". This paper proves the -dimensional version of the theorem in a more general setting involving measures. The paper attributes the case to Stanislaw Ulam, based on information from a referee; but claim that this is incorrect, given Steinhaus's paper, although \\"Ulam did make a fundamental contribution in proposing\\" the Borsuk‚ÄìUlam theorem. Two-dimensional variant: proof using a rotating-knife The two-dimensional variant of the theorem (also known as the pancake theorem) can be proved by an argument which appears in the fair cake-cutting literature (see e.g. Robertson‚ÄìWebb rotating-knife procedure). For each angle \\\\alpha\\\\in[0,180^\\\\circ], we can bisect pancake #1 using a straight line in angle \\\\alpha (to see this, translate [move] a straight line in angle \\\\alpha from -\\\\infty to \\\\infty; the fraction of pancake #1 covered by the line changes continuously from 0 to 1, so by the intermediate value theorem it must be equal to 1/2 somewhere along the way). This means that we can take a straight knife, rotate it at every angle \\\\alpha\\\\in[0,180^\\\\circ] and translate it appropriately for that particular angle, such that pancake #1 is bisected at each angle and corresponding translation. When the knife is at angle 0, it also cuts pancake #2, but the pieces are probably unequal (if we are lucky and the pieces are equal, we are done). Define the 'positive' side of the knife as the side in which the fraction of pancake #2 is larger. Define p(\\\\alpha) as the fraction of pancake #2 at the positive side of the knife. Initially p(0)\\\\geq 1/2. When the knife is at angle 180, the knife is upside-down, so p(180)\\\\leq 1/2. By the intermediate value theorem, there must be an angle in which p(\\\\alpha)=1/2. Cutting at that angle bisects both pancakes simultaneously. n-dimensional variant: proof using the Borsuk‚ÄìUlam theorem The ham sandwich theorem can be proved as follows using the Borsuk‚ÄìUlam theorem. This proof follows the one described by Steinhaus and others (1938), attributed there to Stefan Banach, for the case. In the field of Equivariant topology, this proof would fall under the configuration-space/tests-map paradigm. Let denote the objects that we wish to simultaneously bisect. Let be the unit -sphere embedded in -dimensional Euclidean space \\\\mathbb{R}^n, centered at the origin. For each point on the surface of the sphere , we can define a continuum of oriented affine hyperplanes (not necessarily centred at 0) perpendicular to the (normal) vector from the origin to , with the \\"positive side\\" of each hyperplane defined as the side pointed to by that vector (i.e. it is a choice of orientation). By the intermediate value theorem, every family of such hyperplanes contains at least one hyperplane that bisects the bounded object : at one extreme translation, no volume of is on the positive side, and at the other extreme translation, all of 's volume is on the positive side, so in between there must be a translation that has half of 's volume on the positive side. If there is more than one such hyperplane in the family, we can pick one canonically by choosing the midpoint of the interval of translations for which is bisected. Thus we obtain, for each point on the sphere , a hyperplane that is perpendicular to the vector from the origin to and that bisects . Now we define a function from the -sphere to -dimensional Euclidean space \\\\mathbb{R}^{n-1} as follows: :vol of on the positive side of , vol of on the positive side of , ‚Ä¶, vol of on the positive side of . This function is continuous. By the Borsuk‚ÄìUlam theorem, there are antipodal points and on the sphere such that . Antipodal points and correspond to hyperplanes and that are equal except that they have opposite positive sides. Thus, means that the volume of is the same on the positive and negative side of (or ), for . Thus, (or ) is the desired ham sandwich cut that simultaneously bisects the volumes of . Measure theoretic versions In measure theory, proved two more general forms of the ham sandwich theorem. Both versions concern the bisection of subsets of a common set , where has a Carath√©odory outer measure and each has finite outer measure. Their first general formulation is as follows: for any suitably restricted real function f \\\\colon S^n \\\\times X \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}, there is a point of the -sphere such that the surface , dividing into and , simultaneously bisects the outer measure of . The proof is again a reduction to the Borsuk-Ulam theorem. This theorem generalizes the standard ham sandwich theorem by letting . Their second formulation is as follows: for any measurable functions over that are linearly independent over any subset of of positive measure, there is a linear combination such that the surface , dividing into and , simultaneously bisects the outer measure of . This theorem generalizes the standard ham sandwich theorem by letting and letting , for , be the -th coordinate of . Discrete and computational geometry versions A ham-sandwich cut of eight red points and seven blue points in the plane. In discrete geometry and computational geometry, the ham sandwich theorem usually refers to the special case in which each of the sets being divided is a finite set of points. Here the relevant measure is the counting measure, which simply counts the number of points on either side of the hyperplane. In two dimensions, the theorem can be stated as follows: :For a finite set of points in the plane, each colored \\"red\\" or \\"blue\\", there is a line that simultaneously bisects the red points and bisects the blue points, that is, the number of red points on either side of the line is equal and the number of blue points on either side of the line is equal. There is an exceptional case when points lie on the line. In this situation, we count each of these points as either being on one side, on the other, or on neither side of the line (possibly depending on the point), i.e. \\"bisecting\\" in fact means that each side contains less than half of the total number of points. This exceptional case is actually required for the theorem to hold, of course when the number of red points or the number of blue is odd, but also in specific configurations with even numbers of points, for instance when all the points lie on the same line and the two colors are separated from each other (i.e. colors don't alternate along the line). A situation where the numbers of points on each side cannot match each other is provided by adding an extra point out of the line in the previous configuration. In computational geometry, this ham sandwich theorem leads to a computational problem, the ham sandwich problem. In two dimensions, the problem is this: given a finite set of points in the plane, each colored \\"red\\" or \\"blue\\", find a ham sandwich cut for them. First, described an algorithm for the special, separated case. Here all red points are on one side of some line and all blue points are on the other side, a situation where there is a unique ham sandwich cut, which Megiddo could find in linear time. Later, gave an algorithm for the general two-dimensional case; the running time of their algorithm is , where the symbol indicates the use of Big O notation. Finally, found an optimal -time algorithm. This algorithm was extended to higher dimensions by where the running time is o(n^{d-1}). Given sets of points in general position in -dimensional space, the algorithm computes a -dimensional hyperplane that has an equal number of points of each of the sets in both of its half-spaces, i.e., a ham-sandwich cut for the given points. If is a part of the input, then no polynomial time algorithm is expected to exist, as if the points are on a moment curve, the problem becomes equivalent to necklace splitting, which is PPA-complete. A linear-time algorithm that area-bisects two disjoint convex polygons is described by . Generalizations The original theorem works for at most collections, where is the number of dimensions. If we want to bisect a larger number of collections without going to higher dimensions, we can use, instead of a hyperplane, an algebraic surface of degree , i.e., an ()‚Äìdimensional surface defined by a polynomial function of degree : Given \\\\binom{k+n}{n}-1 measures in an ‚Äìdimensional space, there exists an algebraic surface of degree which bisects them all. (). This generalization is proved by mapping the ‚Äìdimensional plane into a \\\\binom{k+n}{n}-1 dimensional plane, and then applying the original theorem. For example, for and , the 2‚Äìdimensional plane is mapped to a 5‚Äìdimensional plane via: :.  See also  * Exact division References *. *. . *. *. *. *. . *. *.

It was a joint effort of Canadian Department of Communications, who designed and built the satellite, NASA who tested, launched and operated the satellite, and European Space Agency (ESA) who provided the 1200 watts solar panels and other devices. The three agencies shared the satellite and the data from the experiments. Although the launch of the ATS-6 spacecraft in 1974 marked the end of NASA's program of experimental communications satellites. The NASA participated in a Canadian satellite venture known initially as \\"Cooperative Applications Satellite-C\\" and renamed Hermes. This joint effort involved NASA and the Canadian Department of Communications. NASA's Lewis Research Center provided the satellite's high-power communications payload. Canada designed and built the spacecraft; NASA tested, launched, and operated it. Also, the European Space Agency provided one of the low-power traveling-wave tubes and other equipment. Hermes was launched 17 January 1976 and operated until October 1979.  Launch  It was launched on 17 January 1976, from Cape Canaveral in Florida by a Delta 2914 rocket. Designed for a two-year mission it was the basis of experiments past its intended lifetime until October 1979 when a system failure broke all contacts with it. Unlike most communications satellites of the period, which had spin-stabilized bodies covered with solar cells, the Hermes CTS was three-axis stabilized and had its solar panels spread out on two huge \\"wings\\".  Satellite  The satellite was meant to test the practical aspects of a high powered satellite using large antennas beaming television signals directly to homes equipped with small antennas, and two-way communications with mobile stations. When it was launched it was the most powerful communications satellite in existence. This three-axis stabilized satellite was designed as a test vehicle to carry communications- related equipment. The purpose of its launch into an equatorial, Earth- synchronous orbit was: * to demonstrate new technology, * to conduct communications technological experiments, * to develop new communications methodology in conjunction with ground-based components. The spacecraft was a short (1.17-m) right cylinder (1.8-m diameter) with two parallel (1.72-m apart) plane surfaces symmetrically truncating the curved surface. These plane surfaces were also parallel to the cylinder axis. Relatively long, narrow (1.3- by 6.5-m) solar arrays were extendable from mechanisms mounted on the parallel plane sides.  Communications Experiments  * Super high frequency (12 and 14 GHz) - Transmitter Experiment Package (TEP): this communications experiment consisted of a 20-W low-power super high frequency (SHF) communications transponder, a 200-W high-power SHF transmitter package, an SHF beacon, and antenna subsystems. The purpose of this experiment was: 1) to evaluate technical performance of the components and 2) to evaluate overall technical operation of the system. Both types of tests were done over a 2-year period. Reference was sometimes made to the two different types of evaluation as two different experiments. Evaluation of the overall operation was then referred to as a \\"communication system\\" experiment. * Solar Array Technology Experiment (SATE): this experiment was to study the mechanical, dynamic, and electrical properties of a new type of extendable solar array over an extended time period. The two 1.3- x 6.5-m arrays were unfolded from their packs by unfurling a supporting tube that was attached to the extremity of the array. * Attitude Control System Experiment: this was a technology experiment to evaluate the dynamics of spacecraft mechanical flexibility on ACS (attitude control system) operation and to demonstrate that attitude control flight performance was in accordance with stability and control theory. * Canadian Communications Experiments: this experiment involved investigation of practical techniques for use of the satellite communications systems being tested. It included communication techniques for use in medicine, education, community development and interaction, and data transmission. It also included development of compatible ground facilities. About 30 different experiments by over 20 different organizations have been approved by a joint working group, which approved and coordinated Canadian and American experiments for this satellite equipment. * United States User Experiments: this experiment involved explanation of future possible uses of high-powered communications satellites. Experimentation by 13 different experimenters involved medicine, education, community services, special services, and communications technology. The CTS satellite also made history as being the first communications satellite used for video art, by artist Keith Sonnier in 1977 for his 2-part piece titled \\"Send/Receive Satellite Network\\", in which video and character generator text and graphics were fed over the satellite between the East and West Coasts of the United States. This marked the first time that satellite communication technology was used for video art. NASA cooperated with Sonnier's project and provided a satellite uplink truck for access to the CTS satellite. The piece was produced in two parts, \\"Phase I\\", which was a critique of satellite technology and whether it would become accessible to the public rather than the commercial and military purposes for the technology at that time, using feeds sent over the satellite by the artist and other participants, and \\"Phase II\\", which featured excerpts of the feeds sent. Several communities in the Canadian wilderness participated in a series of realistic tests of its capacities. Experiments in telemedicine for Emergency medical services, teleconferencing and community TV were conducted. The satellite was also used in May 1978 to televise Stanley Cup hockey playoffs to Canadian diplomats in Peru to demonstrate its international capacity. This was the first direct-to-home satellite television broadcast in the world. It covered about 40% of the Earth's surface, from its geostationary orbit. In Canada alone, 37 tests were done using a family of 27 ground terminals. The experiments led to the creation of the hybrid Anik B satellite which was both a standard Anik model and a platform for pilot projects of direct broadcast TV. In 1987, Canada's Department of Communications and NASA received an Emmy Award for developing direct broadcast TV satellite technology with the Hermes CTS program.

In most cases, trademark dilution involves an unauthorized use of another's trademark on products that do not compete with, and have little connection with, those of the trademark owner. For example, a famous trademark used by one company to refer to hair care products might be diluted if another company began using a similar mark to refer to breakfast cereals or spark plugs. Dilution is a basis of trademark infringement that applies only to famous marks. With a non-famous mark, the owner of the mark must show that the allegedly infringing use creates a likelihood of confusion as to the source of the product or service being identified by the allegedly infringing use: it is highly unlikely a likelihood of confusion will be found if the products or services are in unrelated markets. With a famous mark, any other use has the potential for confusion, since consumers may assume affiliation with the owner of the mark regardless of the product or service. Background Trademark law traditionally concerned itself with situations where an unauthorized party sold goods that are directly competitive with or at least related to those sold by the trademark owner. A trademark is diluted when the use of similar or identical trademarks in other non-competing markets means that the trademark in and of itself will lose its capacity to signify a single source. In other words, unlike ordinary trademark law, dilution protection extends to trademark uses that do not confuse consumers regarding who has made a product. Instead, dilution protection law aims to protect sufficiently strong trademarks from losing their singular association in the public mind with a particular product, perhaps imagined if the trademark were to be encountered independently of any product (e.g., just the word Pepsi spoken, or on a billboard). Requirements for protection The strength required for a trademark to deserve dilution protection differs among jurisdictions, though it generally includes the requirement that it must be distinctive, famous, or even unique. Such trademarks would include instantly recognizable brand names, such as Coca-Cola, Kleenex, Kool-Aid, or Sony, and unique terms that were invented (such as Exxon) rather than surnames (such as Ford or Zamboni) or ordinary words in language. Some jurisdictions require additional registration of these trademarks as defensive marks in order to qualify for dilution protection. Another way of describing the necessary strength of a trademark may establish some basis for dilution protection from a consumer-confusion standpoint. Truly famous trademarks are likely to be seen in many different contexts due to branching out or simple sponsorship, to the extent that there may be very few markets, if any, that a consumer would be surprised to see that famous trademark involved in. A prime example may be the past involvement of Coca-Cola in clothing lines. Blurring and tarnishment Dilution is sometimes divided into two related concepts: blurring, or essentially basic dilution, which \\"blurs\\" a mark from association with only one product to signify other products in other markets (such as \\"Kodak shoes\\"); and tarnishment, which is the weakening of a mark through unsavory or unflattering associations. Not all dilution protection laws recognize tarnishment as an included concept. Laws by country Canada  In Canada, the legal basis can be found in s. 22 of the Trade-marks Act: It is commonly acknowledged that goodwill is constituted by the reputation of a trade mark and its persuasive effect. = Application of Section 22 by Canadian Courts = In the Clairol case,Clairol International Corp. v. Thomas Supply & Equipment Co. Ltd., (1968) 55 C.P.R. 176, [1968] 2 Ex. C.R. 552 the court stated that goodwill can be depreciated through \\"reduction of the esteem in which the mark itself is held or through the direct persuasion and enticing of customers who could otherwise be expected to buy or continue to buy goods bearing the trade mark\\". The court added that the test of confusion is irrelevant here and that the \\"test is the likelihood of depreciating the value of the goodwill attaching to the trade mark\\" and that this result could be obtained without actual deception/confusion. S. 22 thus steps where confusion fails to tread. Even if there is no actual risk that the consumer might be confused between the two products, the trade mark owner will still be able to prevent another person from using his/her trade mark if that use is likely to depreciate the value of the trade mark. In the Veuve Clicquot case,Veuve Clicquot Consardin v Boutiques Cliquot Lt√©√© the trade mark of the famous French champagne was used by a small chain of women's clothing store that was trading in eastern Quebec and Ottawa. According to the court, s. 22 applies even where a defendant's wares or services do not compete with the plaintiff's and their mark are not identical. The marks were not identical (\\"Cliquot\\" and \\"Veuve clicquot\\") and the risk of confusing the champagne brand and a clothing store was low. However the court ruled that the only element needed was the ability of an average consumer to recognize the first distinctive character. Even if the trade mark is not that well known, the fact that a significant goodwill is attached to it might be enough for the court to find the use by another person unlawful. However, in that particular case, the court claimed that the plaintiff Veuve Clicquot failed to prove that the linkage between Champagne and clothing was likely to cause depreciation. In the Perrier case,Source Perrier v. Fira-Less Marketing Co. Limited, [1983] 2 F.C. 18 the plaintiff, a French company, was the bottler and distributor of spring water. It sought an injunction to restrain another company base in Ontario from advertising and distributing bottled water in association with the name \\"Pierre eh!\\" claiming that the value of the goodwill attached to the French trade mark would likely be depreciated. The plaintiff succeeded on section 22 to stop the use of \\"Pierre Eh!\\" on bottled water. = Proving depreciation of goodwill= The plaintiff has to prove the elements of section 22, particularly that the use would likely depreciate the value of the goodwill of the claimant's mark. A precision has been made by Vaver, that the fact \\"that the use could well cause depreciation is not enough. The use must actually have caused depreciation\\". = Limits to the use of Section 22 = The use of Section 22 was restricted in the Clairol case to the use \\"in the technical trade-mark sense\\". For example, unions are allowed to use the trade mark to caricature because caricature or criticism is not a trade mark infringement, nor event a use of the trade mark, if it occurs outside \\"the normal course of trade\\". (see also The Michelin v CAW case. In that case, the court rejected the trade mark infringement argument because no one was planning on using the trade mark to sell a product). United States Prior to specifically targeted laws being adopted, dilution protection was used in some U.S. jurisdictions to attack domain name infringement of trademarks (see Cybersquatting). For example, in the 1998 case of Panavision International v. Toeppen, defendant Dennis Toeppen registered the domain name www.panavision.com, and posted aerial views of the city of Pana, Illinois on the site. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that trademark dilution occurred when potential customers of Panavision could not find its web site at panavision.com, and instead were forced to search through other (less obvious) domain names. The fact that potential customers might be discouraged from locating Panavision's legitimate website, coupled with evidence that Toeppen was in the business of registering domain names for profit, led the court to find that Toeppen's conduct \\"diminished the capacity of the Panavision marks to identify and distinguish Panavision's goods and services on the Internet\\", and thus constituted dilution. Lately, the Trademark Dilution Revision Act of 2006 (H.R. 683), was signed into law, which overturned Moseley v. V Secret Catalogue, Inc., . Moseley held the plaintiff needed to prove actual dilution under the Federal Trademark Dilution Act (\\"FTDA\\"). The new law revises the FTDA, requiring the plaintiff to show only that the defendant's mark is likely to cause dilution.Trademark Dilution Revision Act of 2006, , amending However, the revision also reduced the universe of marks falling under its protection, requiring that marks be nationally well known to qualify for protection from dilution. For example, when Wolfe's Borough Coffee, Inc., a New Hampshire-based coffee company, sold its coffee under the trademarks that included the words \\"Charbucks Blend\\" and \\"Mr. Charbucks,\\" Starbucks Corporation sued, claiming that the use of the word \\"Charbucks\\" diluted the \\"Starbucks\\" mark by both blurring and tarnishment. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals decided that marks need not be \\"substantially similar\\" under the FTDA for dilution to occur when other factors supporting a finding of dilution, such as the distinctiveness of the famous mark and the degree of its recognition, were present. In its decision, the court found that these other factors may be sufficient to support a dilution claim and remanded the case to the district court in order to determine whether dilution had in fact occurred. The district court ruled that sales of Charbucks did not violate the trademark and could continue.

Topics This Seder (order, or division) of the Mishnah is known as Kodashim (‚Äúsacred things‚Äù or ‚Äúsanctities‚Äù), because it deals with subjects connected with Temple service and ritual slaughter of animals (shehitah). The term kodashim, in the Biblical context, applies to the sacrifices, the Temple and its furnishings, as well as the priests who carried out the duties and ceremonies of its service; and it is with these holy things, places and people that Kodashim is mainly concerned. The title Kodashim is apparently an abbreviation of Shehitat Kodashim (\\"the slaughter of sacred animals\\") since the main, although not the only subject of this order is sacrifices. The topics of this Seder are primarily the sacrifices of animals, birds, and meal offerings, the laws of bringing a sacrifice, such as the sin offering and the guilt offering, and the laws of misappropriation of sacred property. In addition, the order contains a description of the Second Temple (tractate Middot), and a description and rules about the daily sacrifice service in the Temple (tractate Tamid). The order also includes tractate Hullin, which concerns the slaughter of animals for non-sacrificial use, as well as other dietary laws applying to meat and animal products. Although Hullin is about the slaughter of animals for non-sacrificial, and therefore unsanctified purposes, because the rules about the proper slaughter of animals and birds, and their ritual fitness for use were considered to be an integral part of the concept of holiness in Judaism, they were also included in the order regarding ‚Äúholy things‚Äù. Contents Seder Kodashim comprises eleven tractates, with a total of 90 chapters, as follows: * Zevachim (‚ÄúSacrifices‚Äù), with fourteen chapters, and originally called Shehitat Kodashim (\\"slaughtering of the holy animals\\") deals with the sacrificial system of the Temple period, namely the laws for animal and bird offerings, and the conditions which make them acceptable or not, as specified in the Torah, primarily in the book of Leviticus ( and on). * Menachot (\\"Meal Offerings\\"), comprising thirteen chapters, deals with the rules regarding the preparation and presentation of grain-meal and drink offerings, including the meal-offering that was burnt on the altar and the remainder that was consumed by the priests as specified in the Torah ( and on); the bringing of the omer of barley (), the two loaves (), and the showbread (). * Hullin or Chullin (\\"Ordinary or Mundane\\"), also called also Shehitat Hullin (\\"slaughtering of non-consecrated animals\\"), has twelve chapters and deals with the laws for slaughtering animals and birds for meat for ordinary use, as opposed to sacred use, with other rules relating to the eating of meat, and with the dietary laws in general. * Bekhorot (\\"Firstborns\\"), consists of nine chapters and deals mainly with the sanctification and redemption of human and animal firstborns, as specified in the Torah (, and ), and the tithing of cattle (). * Arakhin (\\"Dedications\\" or ‚ÄúEstimations‚Äù), with nine chapters, deals with the rules for determining the amount which must be paid in fulfilment of a vow to dedicate to the Temple the 'market-value' or 'worth' of a person, field or object in accordance with the Torah (), or voluntary contributions to the upkeep of the Temple, and also with laws relating to the Jubilee year (). * Temurah (\\"Substitution\\"), comprising seven chapters, outlines the rules about the substitution of one sacrificial animal for another in accordance with the Torah‚Äôs instructions (). * Keritot (\\"Excisions\\"), with six chapters, deals with the transgressions for which the penalty is karet, meaning, sins punishable by premature or sudden death, or being cut off from the community of Israel, if done deliberately, and the type of sin-offering sacrifice that had to be offered to effect atonement if the transgression was committed in error. * Me'ilah (‚ÄúSacrilege‚Äù or \\"Trespass\\"), with six chapters, deals with laws concerning disrespectful treatment of property belonging to the Temple or using holy objects in a prohibited manner, and with restitution for the misappropriation of Temple property, in accordance with . * Tamid (\\"The Daily Sacrifice\\", lit. ‚ÄúThe Continual [Offering]‚Äù), with seven chapters (in most editions), outlines the Temple service for the daily morning and evening sacrifice, known as the Korban Tamid, in accordance with the Torah ( and ). * Middot (\\"Measurements\\" or ‚ÄúDimensions‚Äù), comprises five chapters containing descriptions of the Second Temple‚Äôs architecture including its courts, gates and halls; its furnishings such as the Altar; and an account of the service of the priestly workshifts in the Temple. * Kinnim (\\"Nests\\"), with three chapters, deals with the instructions regarding the offering of birds, in penitence for certain offences and certain conditions of uncleanness, as described in the Torah (, and ); and discusses the case in which birds belonging to different persons or to different offerings have become mixed up with one another; the name of the tractate (nests) refers to the pairs of birds prescribed in the Torah as offerings (). Structure This Seder, or order, has eleven tractates, arranged, like most of the orders of the Mishnah, mostly in descending sequence according to the number of chapters. The traditional reasoning for the order of the tractates according to Maimonides, beyond the ordering according to number of chapters, is that Zevahim is first as it deals with the main physical purpose of the Temple, namely, animal sacrifices. Menahot continuing the subject of offerings, and so is placed next, according to the scriptural order and the status of meal-offerings as supplementary to the meat offerings. After dealing with offerings to the Temple, Hullin follows, dealing with the related topic of \\"secular\\" slaughter for meat. Bekhorot, Arakhin and Temurah all discuss auxiliary laws of sanctity and follow the order in which they appear in the Torah. Keritot then follows, as it largely discusses the offering for the transgression of certain commandments, and Me'ilah follows that as it also deals with transgressions of sanctity, although of a lighter nature. After dealing with laws, two mostly descriptive tractates were added, Tamid discussing the daily sacrifice and Middot which overviews the Temple in Jerusalem. Finally, Kinnim was placed last as its laws deal with accidental and rarely occurring situations. In the Babylonian Talmud the sequence of the treatises follows the general order except that Bekorot is before Hullin, and ·∏≤innim is placed before Tamid and Middot. Talmud and Tosefta As part of the Mishnah, the first major composition of Jewish law and ethics based on the Oral Torah, Kodashim was compiled and edited between 200‚Äì220 CE by Rabbi Yehudah haNasi and his colleagues. Subsequent generations produced a series of commentaries and deliberations relating to the Mishnah, known as the Gemara, which together with the Mishna are the Talmud, one produced in the Land of Israel 300‚Äì350 CE (the Jerusalem Talmud), and second, more extensive Talmud compiled in Babylonia and published 450‚Äì500 CE (the Babylonian Talmud). In the Babylonian Talmud, all the tractates have Gemara for all their chapters except for Tamid which has it only for three chapters and Middot and Kinnim which don't have any Although the subject matter was no longer directly relevant to life in the Babylonian academies, the Gemara was motivated by the idea that the study of the laws of the Temple service is a substitute for the service itself. Also, the rabbinic sages wanted to merit the rebuilding of the Temple by paying special attention to these laws. However, in the modern Daf Yomi cycle and in the printed editions of the Babylonian Talmud, the Mishnah for the last two tractates are added at the end, to ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù the order. The Jerusalem Talmud has no Gemara on any of the tractates of Kodashim. Maimonides, however, mentions of the existence of a Jerusalem Talmud Gemara to Kodashim; however, it is doubtful he had seen it, as he is not known to have cited it anywhere. Nonetheless, this order was a subject of study in the Talmudic academies of the Land of Israel, as many statements contained in the Gemara of the Babylonian Talmud are attributed to the rabbinic scholars known as Amoraim in the Land of Israel. The assumption is that there was once a Jerusalem Talmud Gemara to Kodashim but that it has been lost.The Jerusalem Talmud on Kodashim, claimed to have been discovered by Solomon Leb Friedlander and of which he published several tractates under the title Talmud Yerushalmi Seder Kodashim (Szinervaralja 1907-8), was proven to be a forgery. See H. L. Strack, Introduction to the Talmud and Midrash (English ed.), Philadelphia, 1931, pp. 68 and 266, n. 16. There is a Tosefta for the tractates Zevahim, Hullin, Bekhorot, Arakhin, Temurah, Me'ilah, and Keritot. Tamid, Middot and Kinnim have no Tosefta.

Morton, was a U.S. Republican Party politician from Indiana. He served as the 14th Governor (the first native-born) of Indiana during the American Civil War, and was a stalwart ally of President Abraham Lincoln. During the war, Morton thwarted and neutralized the Democratic-controlled Indiana General Assembly. He exceeded his constitutional authority by calling out the militia without approval, and during the period of legislative suppression he privately financed the state government through unapproved federal and private loans. He was criticized for arresting and detaining political enemies and suspected southern sympathizers. As one of President Lincoln's \\"war governors\\", Morton made significant contributions to the war effort, more than any other man in the state, and earned the lifelong gratitude of former Union soldiers for his support. During his second term as governor, and after being partially paralyzed by a stroke, he was elected to serve in the U.S. Senate. He was a leader among the Radical Republicans of the Reconstruction era, and supported numerous bills designed to reform the former Southern Confederacy. In 1877, during his second term in the Senate, Morton suffered a second debilitating stroke that caused a rapid deterioration in his health; he died later that year. Morton was mourned nationally and his funeral procession was witnessed by thousands. He is buried in Indianapolis's Crown Hill Cemetery. Early life Family and background Morton's house in Centerville Morton was an Indiana native born in Wayne County near the small settlement of Salisbury on August 4, 1823, to James Throck and Sarah Miller Morton.Gugin and St. Clair, p. 140 His grandfather had shortened the family's surname, Throckmorton, to Morton, but the males in the family carried Throck as a middle name. He was named for Oliver Hazard Perry, the victorious Commodore in the Battle of Lake Erie.Woollen, p. 129 Morton disliked his name from an early age, and before beginning his political career he shortened it to Oliver Perry Morton, dropping the middle names of Hazard and Throck. His mother died when he was three, and he was raised by his maternal grandparents. He spent most of his young life living with them in Ohio. Morton returned to eastern Indiana as a young man, and joined his family at Centerville. Leaving school at the age of fifteen, Morton briefly worked as an apothecary's clerk, but left after a dispute with the proprietor and apprenticed as a hat maker. After four years in the hat-making business he became dissatisfied and quit to enroll at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, where he studied for two years and was initiated into Beta Theta Pi fraternity. He then briefly attended Cincinnati College to continue his law studies. In 1845 he returned to Centerville and was admitted to the Indiana bar in 1846. Morton formed a law practice with Judge Newman and became a successful and moderately wealthy attorney. Morton married Lucinda Burbank in 1845. The couple had five children, but only two survived infancy.Woollen, p. 131 Early political career In 1852 Morton campaigned and was elected to serve as a circuit court judge, but resigned after only a year; he found that he preferred to practice law. By 1854 he was active in Indiana politics. Initially, Morton was an anti-slavery Democrat, but living in a region dominated by the Whig Party he had little hope of furthering a political career without changing his party affiliation. Passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854), which repealed the Missouri Compromise's ban on slavery in the western territories, beyond Missouri, had a divisive effect on both parties. As the Democrats divided over the issue, Morton took a stand with the Free Soil supporters and opposed the Act. Under the influence of U.S. Senator Jesse D. Bright, the state's Democrats expelled their anti-slavery members, including Morton, from the Indiana state convention in 1854. That same year Morton joined with other political factions to form the People's party, the forerunner to the state's Republican party.Gugin and St. Clair, p. 141Woollen, p. 130 By February 1856 Morton had made his way to the newly formed Republican party at the national level as a member of the resolutions committee to the preliminary national convention that met in Pittsburgh.Thornbrough, p. 73 He also served as a delegate to the 1856 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia. Thirty- two-year-old Morton became the People's/Republican candidate for governor of Indiana in 1856. His Democratic opponent was Ashbel P. Willard, a popular state senator. Despite a hard-fought campaign that for the first time brought Morton to the attention of voters around the state, Willard defeated him in the general election by fewer than 6,000 votes, amid charges on both sides of fraudulent voting.Thornbrough, pp. 72 and 76‚Äì77 Radical Republican George W. Julian, who detested Morton, contended that Morton did not take a strong enough position against slavery, and, as conservative former Whigs claimed, he had been too lenient on the issue in a state where southern-born residents wanted nothing to do with blacks or abolitionism. Despite these criticisms, Morton's anti-slavery speeches made him popular among the Republicans in Indiana. Noted for his \\"plain and convincing\\" manner of speaking, Morton's contemporaries said he was not \\"eloquent or witty\\", but rather \\"logical and reasonable\\". By 1858, the People's party had officially adopted the name of Republican, and in 1860 the Republicans nominated Morton for lieutenant governor of Indiana on a ticket with the more conservative former Whig, Henry S. Lane, as its gubernatorial candidate.Thornbrough, p. 81 Savvy Republican politicians thought that Morton would be seen as too radical and could not carry the former Know-Nothing vote in the southern half of the state, while a man of Whig antecedents like Lane would. Because both men had strong support within the party, and neither had much desire to make open war on one another, a compromise was arranged, giving Lane the gubernatorial nomination and Morton the nomination for lieutenant governor. Both nominees understood that if they carried the state and a Republican majority was elected to the state legislature in the fall, the Indiana General Assembly would choose Lane for a seat in the U.S. Senate and Morton would become the successor to the Indiana governorship.Thornbrough, pp. 86‚Äì87 The campaign focused primarily on the prevailing issues of the nation, including homesteading legislation, tariffs, and the looming possibility of civil war.Thornbrough, p. 94 Lane and Morton won in the state's general election and the Republicans gained control of the state legislature. As it had been pre-arranged with the candidates, on the day after Lane's inauguration as governor, the General Assembly chose him to fill a U.S. Senate seat. Lane resigned immediately and Morton succeeded him to become the fourteenth governor of Indiana on January 18, 1861, and its first governor to be born in the state.Woollen, p. 132Gugin and St. Clair, pp. 140‚Äì41 Governor Oliver P. Morton after his first stroke War effort Morton served as governor of Indiana for six years (1861‚Äì1867) and strongly supported the Union during the Civil War. While others urged compromise and conciliation, Morton demanded an end to concession discussions, with no further compromise, and, if necessary, the use of force to preserve the Union. In a speech he delivered on November 22, 1860, Morton declared: \\"If it is worth a bloody struggle to establish this nation, it is worth one to preserve it.\\"Thornbrough, p. 101 He was also a staunch supporter of President Abraham Lincoln's conduct of the war.Madison, p. 156 Morton, who was not in favor of conciliation, believed his role as Indiana's governor was \\"to denounce treason and uphold the cause of the Union.\\"Thornbrough, p. 102 Morton also believed that war was inevitable and began to prepare the state for its outbreak during his early tenure as governor. Morton appointed men to positions in state government who opposed any compromise with the southern states. He also established without legislative permission a state arsenal, where up to 700 men produced ammunition, and made many other preparations for the impending war.Woollen, pp. 132‚Äì133Thornbrough, p. 107 Three days after the war began on April 12, 1861, at the Battle of Fort Sumter in South Carolina, Governor Morton telegraphed President Lincoln offering 10,000 volunteers from Indiana under arms to help suppress the rebellion. By the end of April, about 12,000 Hoosier volunteers had signed up to fight for the Union, exceeding the state's initial quota of six regiments (4,683 men).Thornbrough, p. 104Woollen, p. 133Gray, p. 158 In a special session of the Indiana General Assembly held on April 24, 1861, Morton called for Indiana's politicians to set aside party considerations and unite in defense of the Union. He also received the state legislature's authority to borrow and spend funds to purchase arms and supplies for Indiana's troops.Thornbrough, p. 106‚Äì07 Among Lincoln's \\"war governors\\", who were critically important in the early prosecution of the war, \\"no governor played his role more valiantly or effectively than did Morton.\\" Although Morton's efforts were not without controversy and garnered significant opposition from his political adversaries, his greatest strength during the war was his ability to raise volunteers and money for the Union army and to equip them for battle. Morton also successfully suppressed Indiana's Confederate sympathizers.Gray, p. 144 As the leader of the Republicans in the state, he confronted the Peace Democrats, especially the \\"Copperheads\\".Kenneth M. Stampp, Indiana Politics during the Civil War (1949) Lincoln and Morton maintained a close alliance during the war, although Lincoln was wary at times of Morton's ruthlessness. Lincoln also recognized the Indiana governor had significant fears, once remarking that Morton was \\"a good fellow, but at times he is the skeeredest person I know.\\"Gugin and St. Clair, p. 142 Morton was especially afraid that Kentucky, across the Ohio River from Indiana's southern border, would secede from the Union and pose a threat to Indiana's security.Thornbrough, p. 108‚Äì09 Morton went to great lengths to ensure that Indiana contributed as much as possible to the war effort. He was not afraid to criticize others if he felt Indiana's interests were being overlooked. Morton frequently clashed with federal authorities and military leaders over recruitment policies, regimental assignments, appointment of military leaders, purchases of supplies, and the care given to sick and wounded soldiers, among other issues. Although he wanted Indiana to receive as much recognition as other states, Morton's political opponents often challenged his efforts. Governor Morton once complained to Lincoln that \\"no other free state is so populated with southerners\\", which he believed kept him from being as forceful as he wanted to be.Sharp p. 94 In 1862 Morton attended the Loyal War Governors' Conference in Altoona, Pennsylvania, organized by Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Gregg Curtin, that gave Lincoln the support needed for his Emancipation Proclamation.Foulke V1, p. 346 Emancipation and the conscription of men to fight a protracted war became major issues that divided Republicans and Democrats during Morton's tenure as governor.Madison, p. 161 Conflict with the General Assembly Although Morton was able to keep the state united during the first phase of the war, once emancipation became an issue in 1862, the Republicans suffered a major defeat in the mid-term elections, and Morton lost the support of the strong Democratic majority in the legislature. Before the new legislature convened in 1863, Morton began circulating reports that the Democrats intended to seize control of the state government, secede from the Union, and instigate riots. The Democrats responded with harsh criticisms of Morton and Lincoln, the conduct of the war, and the issues of emancipation and the loss of constitutional rights, among others. Accusations on both sides created a tense atmosphere that only worsened relation between the two parties and guaranteed further confrontations.Gugin and St. Clair, p. 144‚Äì45Thornbrough, p. 183‚Äì85 Morton had already made several unconstitutional moves by acting on his own authority without legislative approval, including the establishment of the state arsenal, and the Democrats drafted legislation that attempted to reduce his authority. When Democrats in the state legislature sought to remove the state militia from Morton's command and transfer it to a state board of Democratic commissioners, the governor immediately disbanded the Indiana General Assembly. He feared that once in control of militia, the Democrats might attempt to force him from office and secede from the Union. Morton issued secret instructions to Republican legislators, asking them to stay away from Indianapolis, the state capital, to prevent the General Assembly from attaining the quorum needed to pass any legislation. All but four Republicans fled to Madison, Indiana, where they could quickly flee into Kentucky if the Democrats attempted to force their return to Indianapolis.Gugin and St. Clair, p. 154Gray, pp. 160‚Äì161Foulke V1, p. 237, 325Thornbrough, p. 186 Without the enactment of an appropriations bill, the state government would not have funds to operate, and the Democrats assumed that Morton would be forced to call a special session and recall the Republicans. The Democrats hoped to once again press their measures to weaken the governor, but Morton was aware of their plans. Going beyond his constitutional powers, Morton solicited millions of dollars in federal and private loans. Morton's move to subvert the state legislature was successful; he was able to privately fund the state government and the war effort in Indiana. Former Hoosier James Lanier of the New York banking firm of Winslow, Lanier and Company loaned Morton funds to pay interest on the state's debt until the state government could resume its revenue collecting efforts.Gray p.163Woollen, p. 134Thornbrough, p. 188 Morton's moves caused considerable rage among the Democrats, who launched a vicious attack on the governor. He responded by accusing his Democratic opponents of treason. Following the suppression of the General Assembly in 1862, Morton asked General Henry B. Carrington for assistance in organizing the state's levies for service. He also established an intelligence network under Carrington's leadership to deal with rebel sympathizers affiliated with the Knights of the Golden Circle, and, beginning in 1863, the American Knights, which merged with the Sons of Liberty. Members of these secret groups included Democrats and others who supported states-rights and opposed the Union cause during the war. Carrington succeeded in keeping the state secure, but his operatives also carried out arbitrary arrests, suppressed freedom of speech and freedom of association, and generally maintained repressive control over the southern-sympathetic minority.Foulke V1, p. 409Thornbrough, p. 215‚Äì16 In an incident that would later be referred to as the Battle of Pogue's Run, Morton had soldiers disrupt a Democratic state convention, where many leaders of the Democratic Party were arrested, detained, or threatened.Bodenhamer, pp. 441‚Äì443 Morton also urged pro-war Democrats to abandon their party in the name of unity for the duration of the war, and met with some success. Former governor Joseph A. Wright was among the Democrats who had been expelled from the party in 1854, and in an attempt to show his bipartisanship, Morton appointed him to the U.S. Senate.Gray p.159 In reaction to Morton's actions against dissenters, the Indiana Democratic Party called Morton a \\"Dictator\\" and an \\"Underhanded Mobster.\\" Republicans countered that the Democrats were using \\"treasonable and obstructionist tactics in the conduct of the war\\". Morton illegally‚Äîwithout approval from the state legislature‚Äîcalled out the state militia in July 1863 to counter Morgan's Raid, an incident where Confederate raiders under Confederate General John Hunt Morgan crossed the Ohio River into southern Indiana. Large-scale support for the Confederacy among Golden Circle members and southern Hoosiers in general declined after Morgan's raiders ransacked many homes bearing the banners of the Golden Circle, despite their proclaimed support for the Confederate cause. After Hoosiers failed to support Morgan's troops in significant numbers, Morton slowed his crackdown on Confederate sympathizers within the state, theorizing that because the Copperheads had failed to come to Morgan's aid in large numbers, they would similarly fail to aid a larger invasion.Rhodes, pp. 316‚Äì317 Despite his controversial actions, one notable thing historians record from this period during Morton's first term as governor was the honesty with which the government was run. All of the borrowed money was accounted for with no political corruption and repaid in the years after the war. It was by these honest actions that Morton was able to avoid repercussions when the state legislature reconvened after Morton's reelection, this time with a new Republican majority. Second term In 1864 the war was nearing its end, but many Hoosiers were war weary and saw no end in sight as they prepared for the state's next gubernatorial election. Indiana's constitution prohibited a governor to serve more than four years in any eight-year period, but Morton was elected as Indiana's lieutenant governor in 1860 and had only been completing Lane's term, so he claimed that was eligible to run for governor in the upcoming election. The Democrats were furious and launched a bitter campaign against Morton, who did not do a great deal of campaigning. Instead, he successfully returned about 9,000 active-duty soldiers home on leave to vote in the election, presumably for Morton, \\"the soldier's friend\\", and his fellow Republicans.Gugin and St. Clair, p. 147 Morton was reelected to office, defeating Democrat and longtime friend Joseph McDonald by more than 20,000 votes. Although the campaign was conducted in time of war, with both parties strongly opposing the other, both Morton and McDonald remained friends after the campaign and later served together in the U.S. Senate.Woollen, pp. 134‚Äì135 Many Democrats claimed that Morton had rigged the election because Republicans retook the majority in both houses of the Assembly. Morton was partially crippled by a paralytic stroke in October 1865 which incapacitated him for a time. For treatment, Morton traveled to Europe where he sought the assistance of several specialists, but none were able to help his paralysis. During his recovery, Lieutenant Governor Conrad Baker served as acting governor. With the war ending, Baker oversaw the demobilization of most of the state's forces. Morton returned to the governorship in March 1866, but he was never again able to walk without assistance.Woollen, p. 135 Senator Thomas Nast asks Morton and three other huffy-looking inflationist senators, Simon Cameron, John A. Logan, and Matthew Carpenter, to pardon him for his caricatures, Harper's Weekly, June 6, 1874 First term In 1867, Morton was elected by the Indiana General Assembly to serve as a U.S. Senator. He resigned from his post as governor that same year and turned over the leadership of the state government to Lieutenant Governor Baker. In the U.S. Senate, Morton became a member of the foreign affairs committee and quickly grew to become a Republican leader. He was also made chairman of the Committee of Privileges and Elections. Because of his stroke, Morton always sat while delivering his speeches, but he was noted by other senators for his effectiveness in speaking and debating.Woollen, p. 137 Morton's close observers saw a man of untiring activity, \\"of unfaltering determination, quick as well as far-seeing...\\" Restless and full of energy, one newspaper commentated, \\"He accommodated himself with a kind of cynical indifference to his crippled body, as to a house badly out of repair, and dragged it about with him as a snail does a shell.\\" As a U.S. Senator, \\"he excused himself from no duties; acted as chairman and member of several committees; was never absent from his seat, and was ready for debate at all times.\\"New York Herald, November 2, 1877. Unfriendly sources described Morton in exceedingly negative terms. \\"With a superabundance of the quality called 'force,' Senator Morton possesses one of the most terrible natures in public life,\\" and as news correspondent George Alfred Townsend described him: \\"A dark, determined, brooding and desperate mind is reflected in his warthy complexion and introspective eyes. His powerful frame, prematurely wrecked, yet carrying alive the savage will, towers on his crutch, and in his very hobble is the tyrant's pace.... He wants to be terrible for the sake of freedom. His conscience and fortitude are thus fed from his fanaticism. Like all bloody bigots, he thinks he feels God's mercy moving in him.\\"\\"Gath,\\" Cincinnati Enquirer, December 29, 1876. Morton, who served in the U.S. Senate during Reconstruction, supported much of the Radical Republican program for re-making the former Confederate states. Early in his first term, Morton supported legislation to eliminate all civil government in the southern states and impose a military government.Foulke V2, p. 1 He also supported legislation to void the southern states' constitutions‚Äîin nearly every case imposed in 1865 without being submitted to the voters‚Äîand to require elections for representatives to state constitutional conventions that would be charged with writing new ones. In addition, he voted in favor of provisions declaring that the new state constitutions would go into effect only if adopted by a majority of registered voters, not just those voting in the special elections that called for the constitutions' adoption. At the same time, he favored stringent restrictions on former Confederates who were permitted to vote, in particular those who had taken an oath to support the United States Constitution, and had served the Confederate States of America in a political office or in its military.Foulke V2, p. 8 During the impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson, Morton voted in favor of conviction, as did most moderate and all Radical Republicans, and openly voiced his disappointment at Johnson's acquittal. Although Morton delivered a speech in the fall of 1865 arguing that the recently freed slaves were unready for the vote, and once worked to end Indiana's so-called \\"Black Laws\\" that restricted blacks' basic civil rights, and the state constitutional provision forbidding their entry into the state, he reversed his position after the war. By 1866 Morton had come to share the general Republican belief that the only means of guaranteeing loyalty to governments protective of black civil rights must be through giving adult males of every race the franchise. As he explained, \\"I confess, and I do it without shame, that I have been educated by the great events of War.\\" He championed the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, and when the Democrats began to resign en masse from the Senate during its debate to prevent a quorum, Morton engineered a maneuver that kept the bill in the docket and allowed it to be passed.Woollen, p. 138Lockridge, 325‚Äì332Gugin and St. Clair, pp. 148‚Äì49 U.S. Senator George Frisbie Hoar once judged Morton as a man with \\"little regard for Constitutional scruples.\\" Not that Morton would have willfully flouted his oath to uphold the U.S. Constitution, but Hoar added, \\"he believed that the Constitution should be interpreted in the light of the Declaration of Independence, so as to be the law of life to a great, powerful, and free people. To this principle of interpretation, all strict or narrow criticism, founded on its literal meaning, must yield.\\"George F. Hoar, Autobiography, 2:94. If so, Hoar's assessment put Morton in the same category as U.S. Senator Charles Sumner, who openly declared the Declaration's decree that all men were created equal the defining words by which all constitutional duty should be judged. After President-elect Ulysses S. Grant's inauguration in 1869, Morton became one of the Grant administration's most able and reliable floor leaders. Morton helped shepherd through the bill readmitting Virginia to representation in Congress and voted in favor of the treaty annexing Santo Domingo to the United States. Later, he countered Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Charles Sumner of Massachusetts in a bitter debate over the president's motives and intentions towards the Caribbean nation and its people.Cincinnati Daily Gazette, December 12, 21, 22, 1870. In the Senate Morton argued in favor of the Enforcement Act (1871), also known as the so-called Ku-Klux Act, that gave the president expanded power to oppose terrorism in the Deep South. Morton, known as a masterful waver of the \\"bloody shirt\\", was unstinting in his efforts to connect the Democrats to wartime treason and peacetime violence, and generally could be relied on to provide a ready and strong defense of the federal government's right to intervene and enforce the protection of the civil rights of black Americans. Morton championed the right of Louisiana's black leader, Pinckney B. S. Pinchback, to a seat in the U.S. Senate, although the effort was unsuccessful. Morton voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1875, and had his strongest support in 1876 among black Republicans in an increasingly \\"solid South\\". The Grant administration, who recognized Morton as a powerful friend, offered him the position of Minister to Great Britain, replacing John Lothrop Motley, but Morton declined. Because the Indiana General Assembly was controlled by the Democrats, Morton feared a Democrat would be elected to his U.S. Senate seat. In 1874 similar concerns caused him to refuse invitations to accept a nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States. (Later, Grant recalled that concerns over Morton's ill health alone had kept him from proposing Morton for Chief Justice, but Grant may have mistaken. Well-advised sources at the time heard that the Senator from Indiana had been offered a place on the Supreme Court, unofficially, and Justice David Davis took the credit for convincing Grant that the rigor of the job would cause Morton a physical breakdown).New York Herald, November 3, 1877; David Davis to Benjamin H. Bristow, January 3, 1874, Benjamin Helm Bristow Papers, Library of Congress; William D. Foulke, Oliver P. Morton, 2:339-340. Second term Morton was reelected to the U.S. Senate in 1873, and began his second term in 1874. His stand on paper money added to his controversial reputation. During a time of serious economic hardship and deflation, Morton favored a bill that would have added more paper currency to the money supply. He began his second term by leading the Senate's support for an inflation bill that President Grant vetoed.Woollen, p. 136 Morton's action was politically astute. In Indiana the demands for easy money topped the Democrats' list of priority issues, and in the fall of 1874, they carried the state's elections largely on that basis. However, within a year, Morton joined other Republicans in supporting the Specie Payment Resumption Act, which effectively suspended new currency issues and gave the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury the authority to withdraw currency from circulation. In 1876 Morton was a contender for the Republican nomination for president at the party's National Convention in Cincinnati, Ohio. Richard W. Thompson offered Morton's name to the delegation at a nominee, but Morton's position on issuing paper money to inflate the currency, combined with his failing health, hurt his bid for the nomination among the convention delegates. However, neither of these issues made as much difference as Morton's association with the deeply discredited and scandal-ridden Grant administration. Morton's nomination would have made the Republicans vulnerable on both the Reconstruction and corruption issues. In addition, Grant's supporters had an alternative choice in U.S. Senator Roscoe Conkling of New York. Between the two nominees, the \\"stalwart\\" Republican bloc was divided, with no prospect of coming together because Conkling and Morton detested one another. When the balloting began, Morton's vote total placed him second to James G. Blaine, but Morton had slipped to fourth place by the sixth ballot. Blaine's opponents could only stop Morton's nomination by uniting behind a candidate acceptable to reform-minded delegates and the stalwart bloc. On the seventh ballot nearly all the anti-Blaine delegates, including Morton's, united to give Rutherford B. Hayes the Republican nomination.Foulke V2, pp. 397‚Äì98 Morton ranked as one of the strongest members of the so-called \\"stalwart\\" faction of the Republican party: those members most deeply committed to protecting and preserving Republican governments in the South. Not surprisingly, during the winter of 1876‚Äì77, Morton was among the most aggressive supporters of Hayes's right to the presidency in a close election. When Morton was placed on the Electoral Commission, the group that determined the outcome of the election, there was never any doubt that his vote would be cast for Hayes. After Hayes's supporters made overtures to southern Democrats, offering assurances that the president-elect would take no active role in propping up Republican governors in Louisiana and South Carolina, there were fears that Morton might cause difficulties. In one speech Morton made it clear that the Democrats must make guarantees of fair play and equal rights for southern blacks, before he would support Hayes's program. The guarantees were given, or at least promises were made. To the general surprise of many, Hayes's policy withdrew military support from the Republican governments in those two states, and Morton proved to be one of the president's strongest defenders, urging that his fellow Republicans show patience and give the so- called \\"New Departure\\" time to prove itself. Death In 1877 Morton was named to lead a committee to investigate charges of bribery made against La Fayette Grover, a newly elected U.S. Senator from Oregon. The committee spent eighteen days in Oregon holding hearings and investigations. On the return trip, Morton detoured to San Francisco for a rest and visit. After dinner on the night of August 6, Morton suffered a severe stroke that paralyzed the left side of his body. The next day he was taken by train to Cheyenne, Wyoming Territory, where he was met by his brother-in-law, John A. Burbank, the former governor of the Dakota Territory. Morton was accompanied by him to the home of his mother-in-law in Richmond, Indiana, where he stayed until October 15, then he was moved to his own home in Indianapolis to recover. He remained at Indianapolis, surrounded by his family, until his death on November 1, 1877. Morton's remains were laid in state at the Indiana Statehouse, before their removal to Indianapolis's Roberts Park Methodist Church, where his funeral service was held.Wissing, et al, p. 63 The service was attended by many dignitaries from across the United States, and President Hayes ordered all flags to half-staff. Because the church could not hold the large crowd, thousands of mourners waited outside and followed in a long procession to witness the burial at Indianapolis's Crown Hill Cemetery. Legacy Oliver P. Morton in U.S. Statuary Hall Morton remains \\"the most powerful, important, and controversial governor in Indiana history.\\"Madison, p. 157 To his admirers and supporters, Morton was a decisive, effective, ambitious, and energetic leader as governor of Indiana during the Civil War; his detractors would describe him as a wily and power-hungry politician, who shifted his stance on issues to suit prevailing views for his own political gain. Although his tactics were controversial, and on occasion unconstitutional, he remained a dominant political figure from 1861 to 1877. As one of Lincoln's \\"war governors\\", Morton was most successful in recruiting and equipping Union troops during the Civil War, and became known as \\"the soldier's friend\\", in tribute to his crucial efforts in supplying and supporting the Union soldiers in the field. Morton was also known for standing firm against his political opponents, whom he often antagonized by his ruthlessness, and they frequently responded with severe criticism of his actions.Gugin and St. Clair, p. 139Madison, p. 156‚Äì57, 161‚Äì62, and 164 Policies and criticism Morton had many critics during his long tenure in government service. They derided the manner in which he ran Indiana's state government during the Civil War and criticized his open suppression of the freedom of speech, arrests and detentions of his political opponents, and violations of the state and federal constitutions on more than one occasion. Morton justified his forceful actions as \\"a necessary wartime measure\\" to protect Indiana and defend the Union.Madison, p. 162 In the U.S. Senate he became one of the foremost defenders of Republican governments in the southern states. Recent historiography of Reconstruction has found Morton among the most consistent supporters of the cause of equal justice under the law.Woollen, p. 143 Morton was a formidable personality, detested by his enemies, and vilified in opposition newspapers. According to one account, Morton had no leavening wit, no humor, no breadth of intellect, no sparkle of conversation, to attract those who disagreed with him politically. Another Republican was said to have declared, \\"His presence is a deadly poison\\" and \\"He is a sphinx; and I am repressed into dumbness when trying to hold a conversation with that man.\\"Chicago Times, April 15, 1876. According to a southern newspaper that opposed his actions, Morton was \\"a vice-reeking Hoosier bundle of moral and physical rottenness, leprous ulcers and caustic bandages, who loads down with plagues and pollutions the wings of every breeze that sweeps across his loathsome putrefying carcass.\\"Raleigh Sentinel, February 18, 1876. Other critics and political opponents called him a tyrant and a bully, highlighting his ruthlessness in denouncing, even defaming his enemies, and spreading rumors that he had been a shameless womanizer, forcing himself on every female applicant for favor at the governor's mansion. One Democratic journalist wrote, \\"There is not, probably, in this country, a more conscienceless, corrupt, and utterly profligate man in public life than Morton\\" and \\"He is rotten physically, morally and politically.\\"Milwaukee Daily News, April 16, 1873. It was even alleged that his paralysis came from some unspeakable social disease, brought on by his habits. When the Senator declared himself in favor of woman suffrage, the Saint Paul Pioneer was not surprised. \\"Why shouldn't Morton espouse the woman's cause?\\" it asked. \\"It is woman that has made him what he is -- so the gossips say.\\"Saint Paul Daily Pioneer, June 3, 1874. A much fuller, scurrilous, and very likely untrue account of Morton's private life can be found in the Chicago Times, April 15, 1876. None of his critics could make charges of corruption stick. Senator Morton was among the earliest to refuse any share in the so-called \\"back pay\\" that Congress awarded its members in 1873, and returned his money to the U.S. Treasury as soon as it was given to him. Morton was untouched by the Cr√©dit Mobilier scandal. A hostile Democratic House scoured the official files for some evidence of bribe-taking or shakedowns in awarding Civil War contracts, and came up empty-handed. For others, despite holding many positions that angered his opponents, Morton was highly regarded for remaining clean of graft during the war period when corruption was commonplace. For his honest conduct he was offered the thanks of the Indiana General Assembly and others on numerous occasions. After Morton learned that President Grant had nominated his son, John M. Morton, for Registrar of the Land Office in Dakota Territory, the Senator immediately wrote to ask that the selection be withdrawn, protest that he could not afford to have any relative appointed to any political office.Oliver P. Morton to Ulysses S. Grant, April 13, 1869, Ulysses S. Grant Papers. After the poor decision-making of Senators Jesse D. Bright and Graham N. Fitch, Morton succeeded in raising Indiana to national prominence during his lifetime. The state and its citizens were once the common subject of jokes to the eastern states, but much of that ceased after the Civil War.Woollen, p. 144 Memorials Morton is memorialized in the United States Capitol as one of Indiana's two statues in the National Statuary Hall Collection (Oliver P. Morton). A 1926 statue of Governor Morton by George Brewster serves as the Indiana State Memorial at Vicksburg National Military Park in Vicksburg, Mississippi, in honor of his role as a powerful wartime governor. There are two statues of Morton in downtown Indianapolis. A statue on the east side of the Indiana Statehouse, facing Capitol Avenue, by sculptor Rudolf Schwarz was dedicated in 1907. The other statue, created by sculptor Frank Simmons, was installed in 1864 on Monument Circle, when it served as a city park, and was moved to its new location to become part of the Circle's Indiana Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument around 1899.Greiff, pp. 12, 164‚Äì65 A statue of Morton stands on the second floor of the Wayne County Courthouse in Richmond, Indiana, where a previous high school was named for him; the central section of the current high school is named Morton Hall in his honor. Morton Senior High School in Hammond, Indiana, home of the Morton Governors, is named after him.Woollen, p. 145‚Äì146 The annual yearbook of Centerville Senior High School in Centerville, Indiana, is called The Mortonian in honor of Gov. Morton. Morton County, Kansas, and Morton County, North Dakota, are named in his honor. The Oliver P. Morton House at Centerville was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

It is located in the Pou Senchey District, west of Phnom Penh, the nation's capital. History Phnom Penh airport's former name was Pochentong International Airport (). On 6 July 1995, the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) signed a concession agreement with the French‚ÄìMalaysian joint venture company Soci√©t√© Concessionaire d'A√©roport (SCA), to operate Phnom Penh (PNH) ‚Äì Pochentong International Airport. In return for a 20-year concession, SCA‚Äî70 per cent owned by Groupe GTM and 30 per cent by Muhibbah Masterron of Malaysia‚Äîcommitted to a $100 million improvement program that includes the construction of a new runway, terminal and cargo buildings, hangars, installation of a Cat III level Instrument Landing System (ILS) and associated approach lighting. The Berger Group was selected by the RGC to provide independent engineering services during the concession, to audit the design and to advise on the practicality and cost of the concession's proposed improvements. The Berger team also supervised the initial works to accommodate widebody aircraft such as 747s, including asphalt concrete runway overlays; installation of new ILS, metrological equipment, runway lighting and generator and power systems; and construction of a new fire station, taxiway and turn-pad extensions. Following the successful completion of the initial works, the Berger team provided design review and independent engineering services for the construction of a new terminal building to accommodate growing tourist traffic. The $20 million terminal building includes four mobile aerobridges, over 1000 auto parking spaces and VIP and CIP facilities. Facilities Overview The airport is at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 05/23 with an asphalt surface measuring . The airport has two terminal buildings ‚Äì one for international and one for domestic operations. Recently, it added a new facility for VIP service. The international terminal has four aerobridges built in 2003. Three more aerobridges were added during the passenger terminal expansion in 2016‚Äì2017. The airport's design capacity is 5 million people per year. Expansion In 2014, Cambodia Airports announced a $100 million project to expand the passenger terminals at Phnom Penh and Siem Reap international airports to accommodate continued strong passenger growth. The project saw the extension of the parking lots and terminals, more check-in and immigration counters, and new baggage handling systems. Additionally, the commercial areas were enlarged to allow for more retail shops, new restaurants and food and beverage outlets, and mezzanine lounges to cater to first class and business travellers. The expansions will allow the airport to double its capacity to handle 5 million passengers a year from 2.5 million passengers.

Outside the arrival hall, passengers can take a taxi provided by the Airport Taxi Association or book a ride from Grab, a ride-hailing app. In April 2018, trains operated by Royal Railway Cambodia began running express from Phnom Penh International Airport (parking area) to Phnom Penh Railway Station (City Center). Trains run every 30 minutes and the journey takes roughly 30 minutes. A one-way trip costs USD$2.50. There is also the city bus and an airport express bus. Accidents and incidents * On 3 December 1973, Douglas DC-3 XW-PHV of Air Union was reported to have crashed shortly after take-off. * On 19 January 1975, Douglas C-47A XU-HAK, Douglas DC-3 XU-KAL of Khmer Hansa and Douglas C-47A N86AC of South East Asia Air Transport were all destroyed in a rocket attack on the airport. * On 22 February 1975, Douglas C-47A XU-GAJ of Khmer Hansa was damaged beyond economic repair in a rocket attack. * On 10 March 1975, a Douglas DC-3 of Samaki Airlines was damaged beyond economic repair in a rocket attack. * On 11 March 1975, a Douglas DC-3 of Khmer Hansa was damaged beyond economic repair in a rocket attack. * In March 1975, Vickers Viscount XW-TDN of Royal Air Lao crashed at Phnom Penh International Airport. The pilot was not qualified to fly the aircraft. All four people on board were killed. Accident aircraft also reported as XW-TFK with a date of 15 March. * On 11 April 1975, a Douglas DC-3 (possibly XW-PKT) of Sorya Airlines was hit by shrapnel shortly after take-off. The aircraft was destroyed by fire and two of the three occupants were killed. The same day, Douglas C-47B XW-TFB of Air Cambodge was damaged beyond economic repair in a rocket attack. * 3 September 1997: Vietnam Airlines Flight 815, operated by a Tupolev Tu-134 crashed on approach to Pochentong Airport, killing 65 of the 66 passengers on board. The aircraft was entirely destroyed. The aircraft was flying from Ho Chi Minh City to Phnom Penh. The Tupolev was approaching the Phnom Penh airport runway in heavy rain from 2,000 meters; at this point the control tower ordered the pilot to attempt an approach from the west due to a wind pick-up. The crew then lost communication with the tower, and three minutes later the aircraft collided at low level with trees, damaging the left wing. The aircraft then slid 200 yards into a dry rice paddy before exploding. Pilot error was later identified as the cause of the crash; the pilot continued his landing descent from an altitude of 2,000 meters to 30 meters even though the runway was not in sight, and ignored pleas from his first officer and flight engineer to turn back. When the aircraft hit the trees, the pilot finally realized the runway was not in sight and tried to abort the approach; the flight engineer pushed for full power, but the aircraft lost control and veered left; the right engine then stalled, making it impossible to gain lift. Future In January 2018, the Cambodian government approved a proposal to build a new airport to serve Phnom Penh that will cost an estimated US$1.5 billion. The new international airport will replace the existing Phnom Penh International Airport, with initial plans having the facilities being constructed on partially reclaimed land adjacent to Boueng Cheung Loung, a large lake in Kandal province about 30 kilometres south of Phnom Penh. Cambodia Airport Investment, a joint venture 90 percent owned by Overseas Cambodia Investment Corporation (OCIC), one of the country‚Äôs largest real estate developers, and 10 percent by the government‚Äôs State Secretariat of Civil Aviation, plans to invest the $1.5 billion to construct the new airport. The OCIC will invest US$280 million, while unspecified \\"foreign banks\\" will provide US$1.1 billion in funding. The OCIC will own 90 per cent of the shares in the completed airport, with the rest going to the SSCA While the construction plans are still in the early stages of development, the 4F class airport will be capable of handling large long-haul aircraft and will reportedly cover an area of around 2,600 hectares, which would make it one of the largest airports in the world.

FSG is known for publishing literary books, and its authors have won numerous awards, including Pulitzer Prizes, National Book Awards, and Nobel Peace Prizes. The publisher is currently a division of Macmillan, whose parent company is the German publishing conglomerate Holtzbrinck Publishing Group.  Founding  Farrar, Straus, and Company was founded in 1945 by Roger W. Straus Jr. and John C. Farrar. The first book was Yank: The G.I. Story of the War, a compilation of articles that appeared in Yank, the Army Weekly, then There Were Two Pirates, a novel by James Branch Cabell. The first years of existence were rough until they published the diet book Look Younger, Live Longer by Gayelord Hauser in 1950. The book went on to sell 500,000 copies and Straus said that the book carried them along for awhile. In the early years, Straus and his wife Dorothea, went prospecting for books in Italy. It was there that they found the memoir Christ Stopped at Eboli by Carlo Levi and other rising Italian authors Alberto Moravia, Giovanni Guareschi and Cesare Pavese. Farrar, Straus also poached or lured away authors from other publishers‚Äîone was Edmund Wilson, who was unhappy with Random House at the time but remained with Farrar, Straus for the remainder of his career. In 1950, the name changed to Farrar, Straus & Young (for Stanley Young, a playwright, author (at Farrar & Rinehart,) a literary critic for the New York Times, and an original stockholder and board member) Merger In 1953, Pellegrini & Cudahy merged with Farrar, Straus & Young. Robert Giroux joined the company in 1955, and after he later became a partner, the name was changed to Farrar, Straus and Giroux. Giroux had been working for Harcourt and had been angered when Harcourt refused to allow him to publish Salinger's Catcher in the Rye. Giroux brought many literary authors with him including Thomas Merton, John Berryman, Robert Lowell, Flannery O'Connor, Jack Kerouac, Peter Taylor, Randall Jarrell, T.S. Eliot, and Bernard Malamud. Alan Williams described Giroux's \\"Pied Piper sweep\\" as \\"almost certainly the greatest number of authors to follow, on their own initiative, a single editor from house to house in the history of modern publishing.\\" In 1964, Straus named Giroux chairman of the board and officially added Giroux's name to the publishing company. Sale Straus continued to run the company for twenty years after his partner Farrar died, until 1993 when he sold a majority interest of the company to the privately owned German publishing conglomerate Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group. Straus offered FSG to the Holtzbrinck family because of their reputation for publishing serious works of literature. Jonathan Galassi is president and publisher. Andrew Mandel joined in 2004 as deputy publisher. Eric Chinski is editor-in- chief. In 2008, Mitzi Angel came from Fourth Estate in the UK to be publisher of the Faber and Faber Inc. imprint. Other notable editors include Sean McDonald, Ileene Smith, Alex Star, Amanda Moon, and Sarah Crichton (eponymous publisher of her own imprint). In February 2015 FSG and Faber and Faber announced the end of their partnership. All books scheduled for release and previously released under the imprint will be moved to the FSG colophon by August 2016.

Service's (1874-1958) poems. It was published in 1907 in Songs of a Sourdough. (A \\"sourdough\\", in this sense, is a resident of the Yukon.) It concerns the cremation of a prospector who freezes to death near Lake Laberge (spelled \\"Lebarge\\" by Service), Yukon, Canada, as told by the man who cremates him. The Poem The night prior to his death the title character, who is from the fictional town of Plumtree, Tennessee, asks the narrator \\"to swear that, foul or fair, you'll cremate my last remains\\". The narrator knows that \\"A pal's last need is a thing to heed\\", and swears he will not fail to cremate him. After McGee dies the following day, the narrator winds up hauling the body clear to the \\"marge [shore, edge] of Lake Lebarge\\" before he finds a way to perform the promised cremation aboard a derelict steamer called the Alice May. Much to the narrator's horror, he later discovers Sam's ghost in the makeshift crematorium, enjoying the warmth. Robert Service based the poem on an experience of his roommate, Dr. Leonard S. E. Sugden, who had cremated a corpse in the firebox of the steamer Olive May. A success upon its initial publication in 1907, the poem became a staple of traditional campfire storytelling in North America throughout the 20th century. An edition of the poem, published in 1986 and illustrated by Ted Harrison, is read widely in Canadian elementary schools. The reality behind the fiction Although the poem was fiction, it was based on people and things that Robert Service actually saw in the Yukon. Lake Laberge is formed by a widening of the Yukon River just north of Whitehorse and is still in use by kayakers. The Alice May was based on the derelict stern-wheeler the Olive May that belonged to the Bennett Lake & Klondike Navigation Co. and had originally been named for the wife and daughter of Albert Sperry Kerry Sr. It was abandoned after it struck a rock near Tagish, which is about 50 kilometres south of Lake Laberge. Dr. Sugden used its firebox to cremate the body of Cornelius Curtin (who had died of pneumonia). The remains were then shipped to his family for burial. (Although a boat named Alice May sank on Lake Laberge, that happened a decade after the publication of the poem.) William Samuel McGee (b 1868, Lindsay, Ontario, - d 1940, Beiseker, Alberta) was primarily a road builder but did indulge in some prospecting. Like others, McGee was in San Francisco, California, at the time of the Klondike Gold Rush and in 1898 left for the Klondike. In 1904, Service, who was working in the Canadian Bank of Commerce (the predecessor of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce) branch in Whitehorse, saw McGee's name on a form and used it in his poem as it was a rhyme for \\"Tennessee\\". In 1909 McGee traveled south of the Yukon to build roads, including some in Yellowstone National Park. Eventually, McGee and his wife moved to live with their daughter outside of Beiseker. However, in 1930 McGee returned to the Yukon to try prospecting along the Liard River, but met with no success. He did however return with an urn that he had purchased in Whitehorse. The urns, said to contain the ashes of Sam McGee, were being sold to visitors. McGee spent the rest of his life at his daughter's farm where he died in 1940 of a heart attack. Today On 17 August 1976, Canada Post issued \\"Robert W. Service, Sam McGee\\" as an 8¬¢ stamp designed by David Charles Bierk. In 1995, Canadian band Weeping Tile (Sarah Harmer) released Eepee, featuring the song ‚ÄúWestray‚Äù, borrowing lines from The Cremation of Sam McGee, with slight changes to the lyrics written to reference the Westray mine disaster. Coal replaces gold in this version of the tale. Johnny Cash's reading of the poem was National Public Radio's song of the day on May 9, 2006. Cash's \\"The Cremation of Sam McGee\\" was released along with a vast collection of personal archive recordings of Johnny Cash on the two-disc album Personal File. Some believe Cash misreads the occasional word (such as \\"toil for gold\\" instead of \\"moil for gold\\") and accidentally transposes a few lines, but there are printed versions of the poem with \\"toil\\" used in place of \\"moil\\". Canadian folksinger/songwriter Stompin' Tom Connors created an uptempo song summarizing the tale in the early 1970s on his album Stompin' Tom Meets Big Joe Mufferaw. The poem was anthologized in the Oxford Book of Narrative Verse (1983). The NFB (National Film Board of Canada) released an animated film in 1990 of the poem, read by Max Ferguson and using Ted Harrison's illustrations.

As a form of cremation, a body is placed upon or under the pyre, which is then set on fire. In discussing ancient Greek religion, \\"pyre\\" (the normal Greek word for fire anglicized) is also used for the sacred fires at altars, on which parts of the animal sacrifice were burnt as an offering to the deity.  Materials  Pyres are crafted using wood. The composition of a pyre may be determined through use of charcoal analysis. Charcoal analysis helps to predict composition of the fuel and local forestry of the charcoal being studied.  Ireland  Specifically, in the Bronze Age, pyre materials were gathered based on local abundance and ease of access to the wood although materials were also selected due to the specific properties, potential traditional purpose, or due to economical reasons. In Templenoe, pyres typically consisted of oak and fruit wood compositions.  Poland  From analyzing three necropolises, in Kokot√≥w, Paw≈Çowice and Korytnica, it seems that Polish pyres consisted of primarily Scots pine, birch, and oak trees, as pines, birch, and oak were dense in local woodlands. All parts of the tree were used including the trunk, branches, twigs, and even pine cones. During WWII, pyres were used in German death camps on Polish territory, such as Treblinka.  Pyre remains in Britain  Worked antler and bone objects, along with flint and flake tools, and copper-alloys are most commonly found in pyre cremation remains. The copper-alloys leave a blue-green stain and are typically fused to the ribs, arms, and other areas where jewelry is commonly worn. = Analysis of bone fragment size = A study was done on the bone fragments of cremations to show that not only will movement of the bone fragments cause breakage but also environmental factors play a part. After studying cremation remains in urns that had been tightly sealed and had no evidence of environmental disturbance it was found that on average bigger bone fragment sizes were observed meaning less bone breakage had occurred. It was concluded that if cremated bone is placed in an urn before burial the original bone fragment size will be preserved. This study was intended to explain that more cautionary measures should be taken during and after any cremation occurs and to educate those who are studying cremated bone that the size of the fragments will be smaller than there were right after cremation. Uses The funeral pyre of Chan Kusalo (the Buddhist high monk of Northern Thailand) at Wat Chedi Luang, Chiang Mai, Thailand The tiered funeral pyre of Burmese Buddhist Monk at Pa-Auk Village, Mon State. Traditionally, pyres are used for the cremation of the dead in the Hindu and Sikh religions, a practice which dates back several thousands of years. Funeral pyres were also used in Viking and Roman culture. Secular Pyres and bonfires are used in celebrations and remembrance in services. Examples of these are Guy Fawkes Night in the United Kingdom and some Commonwealth countries, where the 'Guy', either seen as an effigy of Guy Fawkes or the Pope, is burned. Funeral pyres were used by the Nazis to cremate the bodies of 1,500,000+ prisoners in Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka extermination camps, as opposed to the crematoria used in other camps. Pyres have also been used to dispose of large quantities of livestock in agriculture, particularly those infected with disease. Pyres are lit around the clock in Varanasi, India as it is considered one of the oldest standing cities. Hindu's believe that by resting the ashes of the dead in the Ganges river in at Varanasi, the dead will achieve Moksha. Hindus will travel great lengths in order to perform ritualistic duties such as praying, attending to their dead, or to die.  Sati practice in India  In the early 19th century, some Hindu groups practiced Sati (also known as suttee). Sati is the act of immolation of the widow to honor devotion to the recently deceased husband. This involves being burned alive on the pyre or even being buried alive. Environmental impacts of pyres Environmental impact in Southern Asia Buddhist monks procession in front of a pyre in Laos Chakrabarty RK, et al. examined the environmental effects of Southern Asia's funeral pyres in their study, ‚ÄúFuneral pyres in South Asia: Brown carbon aerosol emissions and climate impacts. Environmental Science & Technology Letters.‚Äù The heating of the atmosphere from carbonaceous aerosols resulting from human activities is a significant contributor to climate change in South Asia. In this region, fossil fuel use and residential biofuels have been documented to be the primary emitter of light-absorbing black carbon aerosols. The study determined the emitted organic carbon contributed 40% to smoke absorption of visible solar radiation, about 92 Gg annually. A second study examined the carbonaceous fractions associated with indoor PM2.5/PM10 during Asian cultural and ritual burning practices. (Dewangan, et al.) This study concluded drastically higher levels of biomass burning markers within burial rituals performed indoors compared to levels collected for residential indoors and ambient outdoors, with levels reaching three-eightfold higher levels of carbonaceous aerosols. These high chemical levels were also found to correlate to higher aerosol fraction levels during winter months in both Muslim Holy Shrines and marriage places. The study concluded PM concentrations were significantly higher in indoor-ritual locations and suggested further studies and actions be taken to investigate risk and health assessment and calls for regulatory agencies to propose new guidelines for indoor cultural/ritual locations. Environmental impacts in India A traditional Hindu funeral pyre takes six hours and burns 500‚Äì600 kilogrammes (1,102‚Äì1,323 pounds) of wood to burn a body completely. Every year fifty to sixty million trees are burned during cremations in India, which results in about eight million tonnes of carbon dioxide or greenhouse gas emissions. Air pollution, deforestation and large quantities of ash, which are later thrown into rivers, adding to the toxicity of their waters, pose great environmental problems. Green Revolution Foundation under the parent organisation of Sarthak Charitable Trust, a Delhi- based [NGO] working to reduce the environmental impact of funeral pyres, claims to have created an alternative of wood that reduces cutting of trees. It helps in saving environment. Also it promotes Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. As a result, the cost is reduced significantly and emissions are cut by up to 60%. Legality of open-air pyres In ancient times burning bodies was a practiced form of burial. Even today people tend to bury the dead or cremate them. Open- air cremations, known as funeral pyres, are uncommon and even illegal in some countries, particularly in the Western World, because it is considered taboo. While cremation is commonplace, open air cremations in the United Kingdom were considered to be unlawful under the Cremation Act 1902. The law was created to prevent the creation of a private cremation industry and because of issues concerning property. But at the time environmental concerns did not play any factor in the creation of the law. On February 2010, A Hindu man named Davender Ghai was granted permission to be cremated on a traditional open-air pyre, when a court of appeals in the United Kingdom ruled them legal inside of a building with an open roof and away from roads or homes. In the U.S., a group in Crestone, Colorado, a part of the Crestone End of Life Project, obtained legal permission to perform \\"open-air cremations\\". Others have attempted to open up more outdoor funeral pyres but have faced disapproval. Crestone, Colorado is the only place where open-air cremations are legal in the United States. They can perform around 12 a year, regardless of religion and families can be involved in the process if they would like. At this time, the group only allows people who are part of the local community to choose this alternative burial.  Roman pyres  In the time leading up to second century C.E., popular funeral practices in Rome consisted of cremation with a pyre. Ideal funeral practices meant burning an ornamental pyre for the deceased, that would burn with enough heat and a long enough time to only leave ashes and small bone fragments. Having to use another's pyre was a sign of poverty or emergency cases. The process of constructing and properly burning a funeral pyre is a skilled task. Often, pyres would not burn with enough heat to properly cremate human remains. Pyres had to be maintained by stoking the flame and raking the pyre to allow good oxygen flow. Ancient literature refers to the skilled job of an ustor, meaning a professional pyre builder derived from the Latin word uro which means, to burn. However, regardless of professional build, pyres were unpredictable and would go wrong on a regular basis. The Elder Pliny writes of extreme cases in which bodies have been thrown from the pyre from the force of the flames. Other cases, described by Plutarch, involving deceased victims of poisoning, resulted in the human body bursting open and dousing the pyre.. Retrieved 28 November 2018.  Forensic evaluation of pyres  A study conducted by Alunni, et al. examined the forensic science behind cremations on wooden pyres. The study concluded the average pyre does not completely destroy a human body effectively, and differences in suicide via pyres are evident in the remains. A pyre suicide shows signs of remains being more charred rather than completely oxidized by high temperatures, are in anatomically correct positions, poor bone fragmentation, and is without suspicious burn patterns compared to an individual murdered via pyre. Cremated remains are different from traditional human remains in the sense that their physical appearance including bone vary in color, fragmentation, and differ from their original shape and dimension. This is why forensic experimental studies are necessary to fully understand the differences the body undergoes in a pyre. Coloring of bones before cremation is dependent on oxygen exposure, duration, and temperature. The bone color can range from black to brown or an oxidized white color. The type of bone and method of cooling may also alter the bone form. Cooling is also an important consideration, as if the remains are cooled via water increases warping. This knowledge is a consideration for archaeologists to understand the remains from pyres.

It was signed into law on 30 May 1941. Background The most important changes introduced by the amendment included restrictions on the right to habeas corpus, an extension of the right of the government to declare a state of emergency, changes to provisions on the reference of bills to the Supreme Court by the President and various changes that were needed to bring the official Irish text of the constitution into line with the English text. An unusual aspect of the Second Amendment was that it introduced a change to Article 56 of the Transitory Provisions even though that article was no longer a part of the official published text of the constitution. The Second Amendment was not submitted to a referendum. Under Article 51 of the Transitory Provisions, the constitution could be amended during the initial period of 1938 to 1941 without the need for a referendum and so the Second Amendment could be adopted in the same manner as any other law. The amendment was adopted partly as the last chance to implement a list of desired changes before the provisions of Article 51 lapsed. The amendment was enacted during the Fianna F√°il government of √âamon de Valera. Overview of changes The Second Amendment introduced the following changes to the constitution: *Reference of bills to the Supreme Court: Altered Article 26, which deals with the referral by the president of a bill to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality. Most importantly, the amendment introduced a requirement that when ruling on a bill referred to it by the president under his reserve powers, the Supreme Court can issue only one opinion, and no dissenting opinions are permitted. That was in keeping with the practice in many civil law supreme courts and was intended to promote legal certainty. However, the provision that was added by Article 26 applies only for presidential references of bills, and the Supreme Court may still issue dissenting opinions in all other circumstances. A further alteration to Article 34 provided that a law that has survived a reference to the Supreme Court can never again have its constitutionality challenged. *Habeas corpus: Altered Article 40, dealing with habeas corpus. Before the Second Amendment, detained individuals had the constitutional right to apply to any High Court judge for a writ of habeas corpus and to as many High Court judges as they wished. Since the Second Amendment, prisoners have a right to apply to only one judge, and once a writ had been issued, the President of the High Court has the authority to choose the judge or a panel of three judges to decide the case. The amendment also added that when the High Court believes someone's detention to be invalid because of the unconstitutionality of a law, it must refer the matter to the Supreme Court and may release the individual only on bail in the interim. Another new provision gave the High Court authority to defer a death sentence while it was considering a writ of habeas corpus. That particular provision became defunct with the abolition of capital punishment and has since been removed by the Twenty-first Amendment in 2002. *National emergency: Altered Article 28 so that an officially-declared \\"time of war or armed rebellion\\" could be ended only by a resolution of both houses of the Oireachtas. *Irish text: Made various changes to the official Irish text to bring it into line with the English text. That was necessary because while the constitution was being drafted, D√°il √âireann made a number of changes to the English text while accidentally neglecting to make equivalent changes to the Irish document. Rectifying that problem was especially important because under the constitution, the Irish text has precedence over the English text. *Presidential vacancies: Altered Article 12.3.3¬∫, which provides that in the event of the death, resignation or permanent incapacity of the president, a presidential election must occur within 60 days. The phrase \\"(whether occurring before or after he enters upon his office)\\" was added to clarify that the requirement would apply even if the president-elect had not yet assumed office. The Second Amendment also introduced to Article 14, which deals with the temporary exercise of the powers of the president by the Presidential Commission or the Council of State, a slight change to the wording to clarify that the organs may exercise not only the president's constitutional duties but also any additional duties that are conferred upon the president by law. *Senate: Altered Article 18 to clarify that senators nominated by the Taoiseach must be nominated by the Taoiseach who is appointed after the general election that is held immediately before the election of Seanad √âireann. An alteration was also made to the text of Article 24.2, which deals with the procedure if the time for the consideration of a bill in the Senate has been abridged. *Promulgation of laws: Introduced minor changes to Article 25, altering the precise procedure to be used in the signing, promulgation and enrolment of laws. It also added a new provision allowing the Taoiseach to enrol an official copy of the constitution with the registrar of the Supreme Court. *Reference of bills to the people: Introduced minor changes to the procedure for the reference of bills to the people under the reserve powers of the president. For example, it provided that the signatures on a petition to the president for a referendum must be verified in accordance to the law. *In camera court hearings: Altered Article 34 to provide that in \\"special and limited cases\\", a court may administer justice in camera. *Transitory Provisions: Altered Article 56 to clarify the protections given to employees who had begun working for the government before the constitution was enacted. The change was unusual because by 1941, most of the Transitory Provisions, including Article 56, had been removed from all official published texts of the constitution. The provisions required their own omission on the grounds that they would no longer be relevant. However, most of the Transitory Provisions continued to have force of law and so could still be changed by a constitutional amendment.

Sports career Greek national team for the Inter-Allied Games in Paris, 1919. Kalafatis is seated, second from right. Being a big athletic talent, he distinguished himself in track and field sports. But football was his big passion. He played for Ethnikos G.S. Athens and when his later club Panellinios decided to discontinue its football team, Kalafatis together with 40 other athletes broke away and established in February 1908 the first team of Panathinaikos, named Podosfairikos Omilos Athinon (Football Club of Athens) at the time. Kalafatis appointed the Englishman John Cyril Campbell as coach for the new team. It was the first time that a foreigner was appointed as the coach of a Greek team. Apart from Giorgos Kalafatis, other establishing members of POA were: his brother Alexandros, who was the first president, Emmanouel Chrysis, Dimitris Doukakis, Periklis Mpoumpoulis, Granitsas, Mantzakos, Papageorgiou, Gaetas, Demertzis, Stavropoulos, Paschos, Misakian, Reppas, Sapounias and Garoufalias. In 1919, he was a member of the Greek national team that participated in the Inter- Allied Games in Paris. In Paris, Kalafatis collected information also about basketball and volleyball (sports unknown then in Greece) and after his return to Athens, started his efforts on creating new teams with Panathinaikos. He was also a player/manager for Greece in the 1920 Olympic Games in Antwerp. Kalafatis played football until the early 1920s. After he retired, he remained in Panathinaikos as an official. Personal life He was born in Exarcheia, Athens, which was a few hundred meters away from Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium. The family of Kalafatis was from Dilinata, a village in the island of Cephalonia. While being an athlete, he graduated also from the Health Department of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. He pursued a career in the Hellenic Navy, taking part in the Balkan Wars and in World War I and reaching up to the rank of rear admiral. He died on 19 February 1964.

It has been found throughout the continent, but particularly at or near coastal areas. It is smaller than the Pacific gull (Larus pacificus), which also lives in Australia. The silver gull should not be confused with the herring gull, which is called \\"silver gull\\" in many other languages (scientific name Larus argentatus, German Silberm√∂we, French Go√©land argent√©, Dutch zilvermeeuw), but is a much larger, robust gull with no overlap in range. Taxonomy It has traditionally been placed in the genus Larus, as is the case with many gulls, but is now placed in the genus Chroicocephalus. Hartlaub's gull (C. hartlaubii) of South Africa was formerly sometimes considered to be subspecies of the silver gull. There are three subspecies: * C. n. forsteri (Mathews, 1912) ‚Äì north and northeast Australia, New Caledonia, Loyalty Islands * C. n. novaehollandiae (Stephens, 1826) ‚Äì southern Australia and Tasmania * C. n. scopulinus (Forster, JR, 1844) or red-billed gull ‚Äì New Zealand Description Juvenile (first winter) The head, body, and tail are white. The wings are light grey with white-spotted, black tips. Adults range from 40‚Äì45 cm in length. Mean wingspan is 94 cm. Juveniles have brown patterns on their wings, and a dark beak. Adults have bright red beaks--the brighter the red, the older the bird. Distribution and habitat Silver gulls are found in all states of Australia, as well as New Zealand and New Caledonia. It is a common species, having adapted well to urban environments and thriving around shopping centres and garbage dumps. Their successful adaption to urban habitats have seen their population increase in areas of human activity, with the availability of nesting grounds the only limiting factor on population growth. Silver gulls have twice been recorded in the United States; one bird was shot in August 1947 at the mouth of the Genesee River, Lake Ontario, and another was photographed in Salem County, New Jersey, in autumn 1996. Both are believed to have escaped from captivity.*American Ornithologists' Union (2000): Forty-second supplement to the American Ornithologists' Union Check- list of North American Birds.

Behaviour Egg and nestlings in nest at Phillip Island Nature Park, Victoria Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae - MHNT The silver gull has a sharp voice consisting of a variety of calls. The most common call is a harsh, high pitched 'kwarwh'. Feeding The silver gull naturally feeds on worms, fish, insects and crustaceans. It is a successful scavenger, allowing increased numbers near human settlements. Breeding Breeding occurs from August to December, typically in large colonies on offshore islands. The nest is located on the ground and consists of seaweed, roots, and plant stems. The nests may be found in low shrubs, rocks and jetties. Typical clutch size is one to three eggs. Often two broods are raised in a year, and both adults share nest-building, incubation and feeding.

Tumescence usually refers to the normal engorgement with blood (vascular congestion) of the erectile tissues, marking sexual excitation, and possible readiness for sexual activity. The tumescent sexual organ in men is the penis and in women is the clitoris and other parts of the genitalia like the vestibular bulbs. Terminology Detumescence is the reversal of this process, by which blood leaves the erectile tissue, returning the erectile tissue to the flaccid state.Bella Anthony J, Lue Tom F, \\"Chapter 38.

Sammon. \\"A prepaid healthcare scheme in rural Africa.\\" Tropical doctor 30.3 (2000): 151-154  Nocturnal penile tumescence testing  Regularly, men who experience erectile dysfunction are given a nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT) test, usually over a three-day period. Such a test detects the presence of an erection occurring during sleep using either: # a small portable computer connected to two bands placed around the shaft of the penis which records penile tumescence, # a band of paper tape with perforations (similar to coil postage stamps) that is fit snugly around the shaft of the penis and will break at the perforations during penile tumescence. The goal of nocturnal penile tumescence testing is to determine whether a man can experience an erection while sleeping after reporting he is unable to experience an erection while awake. If a man does obtain an erection while sleeping, but cannot obtain one while awake, a psychological cause or a medication side effect is usually suspected. Otherwise, if a man does not obtain an erection in either state, a physiological cause is usually suspected.

Established by the Sisters of Mercy in 1954 as a boarding school for girls, it is now a co-educational day school. Mercedes is an International Baccalaureate (IB) school, and offers the PYP, MYP, and IB Diploma programmes as well as the South Australian Certificate of Education (SACE).  History  Strathspey, . It was established by the Sisters of Mercy in 1954. The purchase of the site at Springfield brought to fruition the dream of finding a healthier environment for the girls' boarding school until that time part of Saint Aloysius College in Angas Street, Adelaide. With the eighty boarders on opening day were sixty day scholars, mostly girls but with a group of boys in the infant section. After twenty-one years the boarding school was phased out when rising costs and a decline in the rural economy made it financially beyond the means of the very families it was created to serve. In 1976 the school became co- educational with the first intake of boys in the Year 8 and numbers have grown. The Mercedes property was originally part of the Springfield Estate. It was sold to Sir John Duncan, (father of Sir Walter, Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives for many years) who planned the house in 1891 and built it in 1899. The family home was named Strathspey after his childhood home in Scotland. The Duncans eventually bequeathed the property to the Presbyterian Church and it became St Andrew's Residential College attached the University of Adelaide. In 1939 the property was sold to Mr and Mrs F. W. Cornell and it once again became a private residence. Archbishop Reynolds, first Archbishop of Adelaide, was in Dublin in 1879 asking for sisters of his diocese when a group of sisters returned from Buenos Aires, forced by revolution to leave their home for twenty-four years. Some were the original Irish sisters but many were South American girls who left behind their families and homes. Accepting the Archbishop's invitation the twenty-four sisters arrived in Adelaide on the 3 May 1880. In 1953 the property was bought by the Sisters of Mercy, and approved by Xavier Dalton. Mercedes, the Spanish word for mercy, was chosen by the sisters to commemorate the circumstances of the Mercy foundation in Adelaide. About Mercedes Student life Many of the students who study at Mercedes College live in the eastern suburbs of Adelaide and Adelaide Hills, because of the easy access by public transport. Mercedes College uses the Adelaide Metro bus service to transport nearby students. House system As with most Australian schools, Mercedes College utilises a house system. At first there were two houses (McAuley and Fitzpatrick), but as enrolment numbers increased, two more houses were added. There are currently four houses, each named after memorable Mercy Sisters. The current houses are McAuley, Fitzpatrick, Dalton and Barry.

Phineas left a memoir of his activities which is preserved in the British Library and was published in 1918. Family background Born at \\"Deptford Strond\\", he was the second son of Peter Pett of Deptford, his elder brother being named Joseph. Thomas Fuller, in his Worthies of England states: \\"I am credibly informed that the mystery of Shipwrights for some descents hath been preserved successfully in families, of whom the Petts about Chatham are of singular regard.\\" It is likely that Robert Holborn, cited as working with Peter Pett of Deptford at this time was a relative of Richard Hoborn, 'Cousin of Commissioner Pett'. Peter Pett of Deptford was the son of Peter of Harwich (d.1554). His sister married John Chapman, Master Shipwright, whose own son Richard was born in 1620 and Master Shipwright of Woolwich and Deptford dockyards. the shipwright who was to build the Ark, raised in the Pett household, \\"as in all probability was Mathew Baker\\" with whom, from 1570, Peter Pett was associated in the works at Dover.‚Äô Phineas's father's first wife, Elizabeth Paynter, had given him a daughter, Lydia, and four sons; their mother died around 1543. Peter Pett of Deptford married his second wife Elizabeth Thornton, the sister of Naval Captain Thornton, and they had eight further children. The three sons were Phineas, Peter and Noah. Elizabeth died, the widow of Peter, in 1597. Life of Phineas Pett Phineas had been sent to the Free School at Rochester for three years and then moved to a private school in Greenwich, until in 1586 aged 16 he entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge. On his father's death in 1589, Phineas was left destitute. Yet by 1601 Phineas had been appointed assistant to the Master Shipwright at Chatham; over the years his good services, particularly in fitting out the Fleet in six weeks, won support for him at court. Phineas Pett first met the young Prince Henry in 1604, through the good graces of the Earl of Nottingham, William Howard, the Lord High Admiral. Pett made a miniature ship for the Prince at Chatham. The keel was 28 feet and the breadth 12 feet, and was finished \\"battlement-wise\\" like the Ark Royal. On 22 March Pett presented the ship to Prince Henry, who named it the Disdain and \\"entertained it with great joy, being purposely made to disport himself withal.\\"Perrin, ed., Autobiography of Phineas Pett, NRS (1918), pp.21‚Äì23: Birch, Thomas, Life of Henry Prince of Wales, Dublin (1760), pp.39‚Äì40, London (1760), pp.38‚Äì39: from BL MSS Harl. 6279. On 26 April 1604, James I of England gave Phineas, described as a servant of Prince Henry, a grant of a shilling a day. The grant also mentions Phineas's elder brother, Joseph.Perrin, ed., Autobiography of Phineas Pett, NRS (1918), pp.173‚Äì5 Phineas and Joseph were named in the royal charter for the incorporation of masters and wardens of the \\"Art and Mystery of Shipbuilding in England\\" in April 1605.Perrin, ed., Autobiography of Phineas Pett, NRS (1918), pp.177‚Äì9 In 1607, Pett made and gave a model of a ship intended for Prince Henry to Howard. Howard thought the model good enough for the direct attention of King James and the Prince. He arranged for a presentation in the presence of both at Richmond Palace on 12 November 1607. The model was set up in a private room off the Long Gallery, in an arched frame curtained with crimson taffeta. King James being likewise impressed and \\"exceedingly delighted with the sight of the model\\" placed the task of constructing a full-size replica of the ship in Pett's charge.Perrin, ed., Autobiography of Phineas Pett, NRS (1918), p.31-2: Birch, Thomas, Life of Prince Henry, London (1760), 96‚Äì7, Dublin (1760), p.80 In 1610, Phineas's wife gave birth to their son, Peter, and in the same year, his (step) Aunt Lydia died. In his diary for 1616, he records that he was 'elected and sworn Master of the Corporation of Shipwrights at our common hall and meeting place at Redriff.' From sometime around 27 March 1616, Pett expected to profit from a commission by Sir Walter Raleigh to build him a vessel of 500 tons for ¬£500. Admiral Howard permitted Pett to lay her keel on the galley dock at Woolwich, with the consent of King James. In 1631, he was appointed a commissioner of the King for making \\"a general survey of the whole navy at Chatham.\\" For this and other works Pett was promoted by Charles to be a principal officer of the Navy, receiving ¬£200 per annum. His patent was sealed on 16 January 1631. In the same year the King, Charles I of England, visited Woolwich to view the launch of the Vanguard, which Pett had built. The king honoured Phineas by participating in a banquet at his lodgings. Pett was later the First Commissioner at Chatham and held this same post from 1631 until his death in 1647.Perrin, p. 146 In June 1634 Phineas made a model ship on wheels for the four-year-old Prince Charles, for use in the long gallery at St James's Palace.Perrin, ed., Autobiography of Phineas Pett, NRS (1918), p.156 Phineas lived for ten years after the Sovereign of the Seas was launched.

The communion of saints (), when referred to persons, is the spiritual union of the members of the Christian Church, living and the dead, excluding therefore the damned. They are all part of a single \\"mystical body\\", with Christ as the head, in which each member contributes to the good of all and shares in the welfare of all. The earliest known use of this term to refer to the belief in a mystical bond uniting both the living and the dead in a confirmed hope and love is by Saint Nicetas of Remesiana (c. 335‚Äì414); the term has since then played a central role in formulations of the Christian creed.Nicetas of Remesiana, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Belief in the communion of saints is affirmed in the Apostles' Creed. The word \\"sanctorum\\" in the phrase \\"communio sanctorum\\" can also be understood as referring not to holy persons, but to holy things, namely the blessings that the holy persons share with each other, including their faith, the sacraments and the other spiritual graces and gifts they have as Christians.William Barclay, The Plain Man Looks at the Apostles Creed, pages 10-12Catechism of the Catholic Church, 948  History  The concept of the communion of saints is linked with Paul's teaching, as in and , that in Christ Christians form a single body.The communion of saintsOrthodox Church of the Mother of God: Glossary CJoseph Sollier, \\"The Communion of Saints\\" in Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1908) The New Testament word ·ºÖŒ≥ŒπŒøœÇ (hagios) translated into English as \\"saint\\" can refer to Christians, who, whatever their personal sanctity as individuals, are called holy because they are consecrated to God and Christ. This usage of the word \\"saints\\" is found some fifty times in the New Testament.Biblehub: hagios The Heidelberg Catechism, citing , and , claims that all members of Christ have communion with him, and are recipients of all his gifts.Heidelberg Catechism, Lord's Day 21, Q55 And the Catechism of the Catholic Church states: \\"'Since all the faithful form one body, the good of each is communicated to the others.... We must therefore believe that there exists a communion of goods in the Church. But the most important member is Christ, since he is the head.... Therefore, the riches of Christ are communicated to all the members, through the sacraments.' 'As this Church is governed by one and the same Spirit, all the goods she has received necessarily become a common fund.'\\"Catechism of the Catholic Church, 947 The persons who are linked in this communion include those who have died and whom pictures as a cloud of witnesses encompassing Christians on earth. In the same chapter, says Christians on earth \\"have come to Mount Zion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable angels in festal gathering, and to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to a judge who is God of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect.\\"John E.

Maas, Gabriel Odonnell, Spiritual Traditions for the Contemporary Church (Abingdon Press 1990), p. 369A Great Cloud of Witnesses: The Communion of Saints  Western Christianity   Roman Catholic Church  In Catholic terminology, the communion of saints exists in the three states of the Church, the Churches Militant, Penitent, and Triumphant. The Church Militant () consisting of those alive on earth; the Church Penitent () consisting of those undergoing purification in purgatory in preparation for heaven; and the Church Triumphant () consisting of those already in heaven. The damned are not a part of the communion of saints. Christians belonging to the Roman Catholic Church ask the intercession of saints in heaven, whose prayers are seen as helping their fellow Christians on earth (cf. ).It‚Äôs Biblical to Ask Saints to Pray for Us. Ignitum Today. Published: 15 September 2013 According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church:  Lutheran Churches  Martin Luther defined the phrase thus: Lutheranism affirms that the Church Militant and Church Triumphant share a common goal and thus do pray for one another. The Book of Concord, the official compendium of Lutheran doctrine teaches: \\"... we know that the ancients speak of prayer for the dead, which we do not prohibit; but we disapprove of the application ex opere operato of the Lord's Supper on behalf of the dead.\\" The largest Lutheran denomination in the United States, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, \\"remembers the faithful departed in the Prayers of the People every Sunday, including those who have recently died and those commemorated on the church calendar of saints\\". In Funeral rites of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, \\"deceased are prayed for\\" using \\"commendations: 'keep our sister/brother ... in the company of all your saints. And at the last ... raise her/him up to share with all the faithful the endless joy and peace won through the glorious resurrection of Christ our Lord.'\\" The response for these prayers for the dead in this Lutheran liturgy is the prayer of Eternal Rest: \\"rest eternal grant him/her, O Lord; and let light perpetual shine upon him/her\\".  Methodist Churches  In Methodist theology, the communion of saints refers to the Church Militant and Church Triumphant. The Rev. Katie Shockley explains the communion of saints in the context of the Methodist sacrament of the Eucharist: The communion of saints is celebrated in Methodism during Allhallowtide, especially on All Saints' Day. Methodist theology affirms the \\"duty to observe, to pray for the Faithful Departed\\". He \\"taught the propriety of Praying for the Dead, practised it himself, provided Forms that others might.\\" It affirms that the 'saints in paradise' have full access to occurrences on earth.  Anglican Communion  The Anglican Communion holds that baptized Christians \\"are ‚Äòknit together‚Äô with them ‚Äòin one communion and fellowship in the mystical body of [Christ]‚Äô.\\" The Church of Ireland teaches that: In Anglican liturgy, \\"worship is addressed to God alone\\" and the Anglican Communion \\"does not pray to the saints but with the saints\\". However, Anglicans pray for (the dead), because we still hold them in our love, and because we trust that in God's presence those who have chosen to serve him will grow in his love, until they see him as he is.\\"  Reformed Churches  The Westminster Confession, which articulates the Reformed faith, teaches that the communion of saints includes those united to Christ--both the living and the dead.  Eastern Christianity   Eastern Orthodoxy  = Greek Orthodox Church = In Greek Orthodoxy, \\"the Church is also a communion of saints, an assembly of angels and men, of the Heaven and of the earth ... divided into what is known as the Church Militant and the Church Triumphant\\". The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America teaches that \\"Through the work of the Holy Trinity all Christians could be called saints; especially in the early Church as long as they were baptized in the name of the Holy Trinity, they received the Seal of the Spirit in chrismation and frequently participated in the Eucharist.\\" Theologians classify six categories of saints within Eastern Orthodoxy:  Oriental Orthodoxy  = Armenian Orthodox Church = The Armenian Orthodox Church understands the communion of saints to have a twofold sense: \\"first, of the union of members of the Church with the Head Christ; and, secondly, of the mutual help and support of these same members in obtaining enjoying, and preserving the common good things or graces of the Church.\\"  Comparison of views  Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Methodist and Orthodox churches practice praying for the dead (as they interpret ). Reformed Churches do not pray for the dead. The Anglican tradition has been ambivalent about prayers for the dead historically, sometimes embracing and other times rejecting the practice.

After some years of retirement, he was entrusted with a mission to the Prussian court (1800-1803), where he endeavoured in vain to effect an alliance with Austria. He had greater success as envoy at Saint Petersburg (1803-1805), where he played a large part in the formation of the third coalition against Napoleon (1805). Notwithstanding the failure of this alliance, he was made foreign minister and, in conjunction with Archduke Charles of Austria, pursued a policy of quiet preparation for a fresh trial of strength with France. In 1808, he abandoned the policy of procrastination and, with the help of Metternich, at that time ambassador to Paris, hastened the outbreak of a new war. Stadion was encouraged by news from Spain regarding the rising of the Spanish population against French occupation and the defeat of a French army by Spanish general Francisco Castanos at Bailen. He was instrumental in persuading Emperor Francis of Austria to attempt to arouse popular resistance to Napoleon in Austria and Germany. The war that began in 1809 pitted Austria alone on the continent against Napoleonic France. The campaign saw the first major defeat of Napoleon at Aspern by the Archduke Charles, brother of the Emperor. Nonetheless, the French recovered and inflicted a decisive defeat on the Austrians at Wagram, one of the largest battles of the Napoleonic Wars. The unfortunate results of the campaign of 1809 compelled his resignation. He was succeeded as Foreign Minister by Klemens von Metternich, whom the Emperor had recalled from Paris. Nonetheless, in 1813, he was commissioned to negotiate the convention which finally overthrew Napoleon. The historian Robert A. Kann called him \\"a man of outstanding gifts, perhaps the foremost diplomat in imperial Austrian history\\" (A History of the Habsburg Empire, 1526-1918, p. 211). The last ten years of his life were spent in a strenuous and partly successful attempt to reorganize the disordered finances of his country. As minister of finance (1815-1824), he founded Austria's central bank Oesterreichische Nationalbank in 1816. He died in Baden, Austria; his son, Franz Stadion, Count von Warthausen, was a prominent liberal statesman of the 1840s.

It was built in 1831 and crosses the River Cam between the college's Third Court and New Court. The architect was Henry Hutchinson. It is named after the Bridge of Sighs in Venice, although they have little architecturally in common beyond the fact that they are both covered. The bridge, a Grade I listed building, is one of Cambridge's main tourist attractions and Queen Victoria is said to have loved it more than any other spot in the city. History Until the early 19th century, all Cambridge colleges were located in the east side of the River Cam. St. Johns college (rapidly expanding at the time) became the first to add accommodation on the west side, an area known as the Backs, with the construction of the New Court. The new buildings and the bridge linking them with the original college buildings, were designed in 1827 by Henry Hutchinson in the fashionable Gothic Revival style. Construction was completed in 1831, shortly before his death. On two separate occasions, students have pulled the prank of dangling a car under the bridge. In the first incident (in June 1963), a 1928 Austin 7 was punted down the river using four punts that had been lashed together, then hoisted up under the bridge using ropes. The second incident (in 1968) a Bond or Reliant Regal three-wheeler car was dangled under the bridge. In neither case was the bridge damaged. The bridge was apparently a favourite spot of former Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, having photos taken there when he was a student, in 1974 and 2000. The bridge was a filming location for Elizabeth: The Golden Age in 2007 and The Theory of Everything in 2014.

However, Hertford Bridge was never intended to be a replica of the Venetian bridge, and instead it bears a closer resemblance to the Rialto Bridge in the same city. There is a false legend saying that many decades ago, a survey of the health of students was taken, and as Hertford College's students were the heaviest, the college closed off the bridge to force them to take the stairs, giving them extra exercise. However, if the bridge is not used, the students actually climb fewer stairs than if they do use the bridge.Fun Fact (#16) about the Bridge on OxfordCityGuide.com Building The bridge links together the Old and New Quadrangles of Hertford College (to the south and the north respectively), and much of its current architecture was designed by Sir Thomas Jackson. It was completed in 1914, despite its construction being opposed by New College. The building on the southern side of the bridge houses the college's administrative offices, whereas the northern building is mostly student accommodation. The bridge is always open to members of the college, who can often be seen crossing it. The bridge is Grade II listed.

It is defined as the time it takes for one bit to be ejected from a network interface controller (NIC) operating at some predefined standard speed, such as 10 Mbit/s. The time is measured between the time the logical link control sublayer receives the instruction from the operating system until the bit actually leaves the NIC. The bit time has nothing to do with the time it takes for a bit to travel on the network medium but has to do with the internals of the NIC. To calculate the bit time at which a NIC ejects bits, use the following: bit time = 1 / NIC speed To calculate the bit time for a 10 Mbit/s NIC, use the formula as follows: bit time = 1 / (10 * 10^6) = 10^-7 = 100 * 10^-9 = 100 nanoseconds The bit time for a 10 Mbit/s NIC is 100 nanoseconds. That is, a 10 Mbit/s NIC can eject 1 bit every 0.1 microsecond (100 nanoseconds = 0.1 microseconds).

Reinhard Bendix built bridges between American and European sociology, he did regard himself as a mediator. Bendix introduced to American sociologists a new perspective, the comparative- historical studies, moving beyond their local boundaries. The constellations of legitimating ideas were not mere reflections of life conditions, or social structure, but independent and real forces. In his terms Americans better understand their own history through its relation to the histories of European nations. The methodological problems raised by such comparisons could inspire him to propose a philosophy of history, but it was not his goal.

Today, most of its members work in academia, while around 20 percent of them work in government, business, or non-profit organizations. ASA publishes ten academic journals and magazines, along with four section journals. Among these publications, the American Sociological Review is perhaps the best known, while the newest is an open-access journal titled Socius: Sociological Research for a Dynamic World. Contexts is one of their magazines, designed to share the study of sociology with other disciplines as well as the public.

Ultimately, a consensus was reached that the time had come for a society of sociologists in the U.S. In early December, the professor and eight others wrote to about 300 people inviting them to a special session during the American Economic Association (AEA) and American Political Science Association meetings later that month to discuss the potential formation of a sociological society. On December 27th, approximately 50 people, including one woman, gathered in McCoy Hall at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, and, by its end, the group would motion to form a new society of sociologists. Though there would be debate as to integrating this new society with an existing organization, such as the AEA, the group would ultimately decide that the new society ought to be an independent entity. = The committee = At the end of the day of the initial meeting, those gathered at the meeting formed a five-person committee to develop a plan for the new society and how it should be governed. The committee members would re-convene the next afternoon to review the proposed structure of the society. Council members would include Edward A. Ross, W.F. Wilcox, Albion Small, Samuel Lindsay, D. C. Wells, and William Davenport. The following men would be elected officers of the new society: * Lester Frank Ward, President * William Graham Sumner, First Vice President * Franklin Giddings, Second Vice President * C.W.A. Veditz (the professor), Secretary and Treasurer When the committee left Baltimore, the birth of the American Sociological Society was complete, a Constitution had been adopted, officers were elected, and plans were made for the second Annual Meeting of the new Society.  1905-1980  In 1981, in celebration the Association's 75th anniversary, Lawrence J. Rhoades prepared a 90-page publication entitled A History of the American Sociological Association, 1905-1980, commonly referred to as the \\"1981 Rhoades History.\\" The publication provides a brief overview of the founding and early years of the Association, as well as highlights of key activities and events in the decades since.\\"History.\\" American Sociological Association, The ASA Story. Retrieved on 31 March 2020. In 1953, during the Annual Meeting in Berkeley, California, each of the (living) past presidents of the Society would compose a voice recording to address the coming generation of sociologists.\\"A 1953 Recording of the American Sociological Society Past Presidents.\\" American Sociological Association. Retrieved 31 March 2020.  1981-2011  = 100-Year Anniversary = In 2005, in celebration of the Association's 100-year anniversary, ASA would publish a 201-page book entitled A History of the American Sociological Association, 1981-2004. The publication picks up where the 1981 Rhoades history concludes, continuing the story and capturing the Association's history from 1981 through 2004. It is the culmination of over two years of detailed research by Katherine J. Rosich. The objective of this volume would be to describe and report on the major events in the life of ASA during the last two decades of the 20th century, leading up to a new century and millennium, as well as to commemorate the ASA's 100th anniversary in 2005. = The \\"ASA Wikipedia\\" Initiative = In the fall of 2011, the ASA launched its \\"Sociology in Wikipedia\\" initiative. Erik Olin Wright, President of the ASA, called for improvement in sociological entries in Wikipedia. He asked that professors and students to get more involved by having Wikipedia-writing assignments in class. The basic goal set forth by the initiative would be to make it easier for sociologists to contribute to Wikipedia, and for sociologists to become better involved in the writing and editing processes to ensure that social science articles are up-to-date, complete, accurate, and written appropriately. In conjunction with the Wikimedia Foundation and a research group at Carnegie Mellon University, the ASA developed its Wikipedia Portal in an attempt to achieve the initiative‚Äôs goal through providing tutorials on how to contribute; video discussions of norms and procedures; and lists of articles and subject areas that need improvement. The Portal would also provide instructions for professors on how to use Wikipedia writing assignments for academic courses.  Code of Ethics  The ASA is governed by a code of ethics and ethical standards, which has been revised since 1970, with the first ASA code of ethics being written in 1970. The Committee on Professional Ethics worked to write this code and upon completing and approving it in 1997, the code focused on three goals, which would be to make the code more educative, accessible/easier to use, and more helpful for sociologists to understand ethical issues.  Publications   ASA Style Guide  ASA style is a widely accepted format for writing university research papers that specifies the arrangement and punctuation of footnotes and bibliographies. Standards for ASA style are specified in the ASA Style Guide, which is designed to aid authors in preparing manuscripts for ASA journals and publications.  ASA Academic Journals and Magazines  The association publishes the following academic journals and magazines: The ASA also publishes Footnotes, a newsletter aimed at the association's members. Footnotes was established in 1979 and is published five times per year.  Organizational structure   ASA Officers  President **Vice President **Secretary ***Council-Members-At Large *President-Elect **Vice President- Elect = Presidents = The following persons have been presidents of the American Sociological Association:  Regional Associations  The ASA is aligned with several regional associations, as well as various state-based, international, cause-oriented, and academic associations. The regional Associations associated with the ASA include: *District of Columbia Sociological Society *Eastern Sociological Society *Mid-South Sociological Association *Midwest Sociological Society *New England Sociological Association *North Central Sociological Association *Pacific Sociological Association *Southern Sociological Society * Southwestern Sociological Association Membership There are five different types of membership categories: * Regular membership * Student members * Associate members * International associate members * Emeritus members ASA Members may also join special interest sections at an additional cost to their membership. Sections Members of the ASA belong to sections devoted to specific subfields, such as Social Psychology or Medical Sociology, for example. Each section has its own set of officers and committees that organize sessions at the annual conference and present awards to section members for their achievements, among other things. Some sections also operate their own academic journals, such as Society and Mental Health edited by the Section on the Sociology of Mental Health, or Sociology of Race & Ethnicity edited by the Section for Racial and Ethnic Minorities. The association comprises the following specialist sections: Entry to the ASA conference, Boston, 2008  Meetings  The Annual Meeting of the ASA is held each August to provide opportunity for professionals involved in the study of society to share knowledge and new directions in research and practice. It provides networking outlets for nearly 3,000 research papers and 4,600 presenters. The meeting is spread across four days and covers 600 program sessions. All ASA Committees and Task Forces meet during the annual meeting. The ASA Council and several Constitutional Committees meet mid-year during the winter months in Washington D.C. Awards Every year, in August, the ASA presents awards to individuals and groups deserving of recognition. The awards presented are: * Distinguished Scholarly Book Major ASA Award * Dissertation Major ASA Award * Excellence in the Reporting of Social Issues Major ASA Award * Jessie Bernard Major ASA Award * Cox-Johnson-Frazier Major ASA Award * Award for the Public Understanding of Sociology Major ASA Award * Distinguished Career Major ASA Award for the Practice of Sociology * Distinguished Contributions to Teaching Major ASA Award * W.E.B. Du Bois Career of Distinguished Scholarship Award Additionally, the Sections of the ASA administer separate multiple awards, which are presented each August during the Annual Meeting.  Controversies  In 1993, then-doctoral student Rik Scarce was jailed for more than five months as a result of following the ASA's code of ethics. Scarce's Ph.D. research was on the radical environmental movement. Based on an FBI investigation of an Animal Liberation Front break-in, federal prosecutors argued in court that Scarce may have engaged in conversations with individuals believed to be involved with the incident. Prosecutors demanded that Scarce testify to a federal grand jury about those conversations, but Scarce refused to answer three dozen questions, citing the ASA Code of Ethics and the First Amendment as his reasoning for remaining unresponsive.Rik Scarce. (2003). Contempt of Court: A Scholar's Battle for Free Speech from behind Bars. . Scarce's refusal to answer resulted in a contempt of court citation and 159 days spent in jail. He was never suspected of wrongdoing and‚Äîin keeping with contempt of court practice‚Äîhe was never read his Miranda rights, arrested, or tried. In early 2010, ASA publicly expressed outrage over a controversy involving Frances Fox Piven and Glenn Beck, asking Fox News to stop Beck's comments.American Sociological Association: ASA Officers Respond to Attacks on Frances Fox Piven. January 24, 2011. An article written by Piven concerning mobilization of unemployed individuals had spurred the commentary by Beck. ASA suggests in their public statements that the line should be drawn at name calling and that political commentators should instead rely on gathering evidence related to the topics and then drawing the proper conclusions. In January 2012, a United States district court ordered Boston College to turn over material from the \\"Belfast Project\\", an oral history project pertaining to the violence in Northern Ireland. Boston College filed an appeal in February 2012, challenging the district court's decision. ASA became involved in the case to help protect human participants from the subpoena of confidential project research data. The statement by the ASA council cited the potential damage this ruling would have on social science research by stifling the ability to study controversial topics. ASA is looking for an affirmation by the court for confidentiality in research.

Kalapana is an American pop band from Honolulu, Hawaii. They are known for their songs \\"Naturally\\" and \\"The Hurt\\". History Early history (1973 - 1986) In 1973, childhood friends David John (DJ) Pratt and Carl James Malani Bilyeu auditioned at the Rainbow Villa for Cecilio & Kapono. Malani was soloing at the Oar House in Hawaii Kai and DJ was downstairs at Chuck's in Sunlight with Kirk Thompson. They got together in DJ's grandfather's garage with Bryant Mackey Feary, another solo act, playing at the Oar House. They wrote songs, rehearsed, and at one point discussed the meaning of Kalapana. The literal translation of the word \\"Kalapana\\" is \\"sprouting money\\". Kirk said the meaning was \\"beat of the music\\", but he wanted \\"Dove\\" anyway. DJ thought it meant \\"Black Sand\\". Regardless, they named themselves Kalapana, playing their first gig at Chuck's in Hawaii Kai. They became a regular band at a club called \\"The Toppe Ada Shoppe\\". They opened concerts for Earth, Wind & Fire, Batdorf & Rodney, The Moody Blues, Sly & The Family Stone, and Cecilio & Kapono. They released their first, self-titled album, Kalapana, which included Jackie Kelso on sax and flute, Bill Perry on bass and Larry Brown on drums. Kalapana performed a three-concert event at the Waikiki Shell during the span of June 25‚Äì27, 1976, where 25,000 people attended. In 1977, they helped select the entrants for the \\"Home Grown\\" album project. Kalapana won several Nani Awards, the predecessor to the Na Hoku Hanohano Awards. They were nominated for four categories and received \\"Best Performance by a duo or group\\", and \\"Best Male Vocalist\\" for Mackey, who had split from the group and joined Billy Kaui (Country Comfort). The group reorganized to include Randy Aloya, replacing Mackey, who was pursuing a solo career, DJ, Malani, Kirk, Michael and Alvin. The reorganized group included Kimo Cornwell (formerly with Beowolf and later with Hiroshima) on keyboards, toured in Japan and released \\"Kalapana Live In Japan\\" (Sun Plaza), \\"Northbound\\", and \\"Kalapana Alive at Yokohama\\". DJ, as Kalapana, also released \\"Hold On\\" and a solo LP \\"Branded\\". In 1983 Bilyeu, Feary, Thompson, Fejarang, Paulo and Aloya played a one-night \\"Kalapana Live Reunion\\" concert at the Waikiki with Hawaii guitarist John Rapoza standing in for Pratt. Kalapana then went dormant for several years while the various members pursued separate projects. Hurricane and Pony Canyon (1986 - 1999) In 1986, Kalapana reunited as a quintet‚ÄîBilyeu, Feary and Pratt plus Gaylord Holomalia (keyboards) and Kenji Sano (electric bass) -- and recorded a successful \\"come back\\" album, Hurricane. Kalapana presented the album at a release party at Rascal Discoth√®que in Waikiki. The invitations were sent out with singles from the album; roses and T-shirts were given away at the venue. For the \\"Hurricane\\" concert, the band wore suits. For the song \\"Living Without You\\", the band was brought out wearing white zoot suit dinner jackets with red velvet bow ties. Kenji, Mackey, Malani, and DJ performed choreography during the concert while Gaylord anchored the group on keyboards. Kalapana released \\"Lava Rock\\" in 1987, and performed with Hiroshima, a Japanese-American group from southern California, and Anri, musicians from Japan; Kalapana played at the grand opening of the Hard Rock Cafe in Honolulu. They performed in the Philippines for crowds of 10,000 people at two sold-out concerts, toured Japan, the West Coast US, Tahiti, Samoa, Guam, Saipan, and outer islands; their first feature length video of the Lava Rock Concert was taped at the Waikiki Shell. Kalapana toured Japan with Michael Paulo, who was then with Al Jarreau's band, and Tris Imboden, the drummer for Chicago. Following, Kalapana had a five-album deal with Pony Canyon Records. In 1997, Kalapana released the Hawaii version of \\"Captain Santa Island Music\\" with liner notes by international radio DJ Kamasami Kong. More recently, Kalapana released in Japan another CD titled \\"The Very Best of Kalapana\\", which is a compilations of 20 of their songs. After battling drugs, drug treatment programs, and relapses, Mackey Feary was sentenced to prison. On February 20, 1999, Feary hanged himself in his jail cell. Feary's problems, and eventual suicide, called attention to the patterns of drug addiction and mental health and treatment needs. Post-Feary era (1999 onward) During the summer of 1999, Kalapana released \\"Love Under the Sun\\", the title song for FM Nagoya's compilation CD, which was used for FM Nagoya's Summer Campaign. Also, they recorded the theme song for the Asahi Super Cup, a series of sailboat races held off the coast of Oahu. Both recordings were done at TK Disc Studios, which are Japanese recording artist/producer Tetsuya Komuro's recording studios in Hawaii. In November 2002, the group released the studio album The Blue Album. Two songs off of the said album feature Maurice Bega on vocals. Guest artists included the group Chant singing background vocals on \\"Ten Years After\\" (written by Komuro), Tris Imboden from the band Chicago on \\"Another Lonely Night\\", Michael Paulo on saxophone, and Pauline Wilson and Garin Poliahu on drums. James Studer appears throughout the CD with arrangements and keyboards. Kalapana continues to tour and record in Japan and the West Coast. The releases, to date, on Pony Canyon are: \\"Back In Your Heart Again\\", \\"Kalapana Sings Southern All-Stars\\", and \\"Walk Upon the Water\\". The fourth LP, \\"Full Moon Tonight\\", was released at the time of the royal wedding in Japan in June 1995, and included a new version of \\"Hawaiian Wedding Song\\" done R & B style. Their latest album on Pony Canyon Records, \\"Captain Santa Island Music\\", consists of songs written for a clothing line in Japan. Each album contains new arrangements of Kalapana classics and newly written songs. As of 2009, the band members were Malani, DJ, bassist Kenji Sano, and keyboardist Gaylord Holomalia. Kalapana received the Hawaii Academy of Recording Arts Lifetime Achievement Award in 2011. The recipients were Bilyeu, Feary (posthumously), Pratt, Thompson, Fejarang, Paulo, Aloya, Holomalia and Sano. Legal Action to Gain Ownership of Recordings and Compositions (2017-18) The early recordings of Kalapana were originally released on Abattoir Records, a label based in Los Angeles and owned by Ed Guy. However, Guy never paid any royalties, and the band received nothing from Guy for approximately forty years. In June 2017, the original members of the band (with Feary's son and heir Sebastian Feary) sued Guy in federal court in Los Angeles, for rescission of the mid-1970s agreements. The case was settled quickly, and Guy transferred all of his rights back to the band, including all music publishing rights. As a result, the band took control of the recordings and all the music publishing and arranged for a full box set and \\"best of\\" package to be released. These two collections were released on November 30, 2018, by Manifesto Records. On Sunday, November 20, 2016, Kalapana, performed in Honolulu with the Honolulu Youth Symphony with a line-up of Bilyeu, Pratt, Holomalia, Aloya (bass guitar), John Valentine (guitar), Garin Poliahu drums and Todd Yukumoto (sax). On December 27, 2018, Malani died of a heart attack on Kaua'i, at the age of 69.

This physiological response model was first formulated by William H. Masters and Virginia E. Johnson, in their 1966 book Human Sexual Response.Masters & Johnson Human Sexual Response, Bantam, 1981 ; 1st ed. 1966 Since then, other human sexual response models have been formulated. Excitement phase The excitement phase (also known as the arousal phase or initial excitement phase) is the first stage of the human sexual response cycle, which occurs as a result of physical or mental erotic stimuli, such as kissing, making out, or viewing erotic images, that leads to sexual arousal. During this stage, the body prepares for sexual intercourse, initially leading to the plateau phase. There is wide socio-cultural variation regarding preferences for the length of foreplay and the stimulation methods used. Physical and emotional interaction and stimulation of the erogenous zones during foreplay usually establishes at least some initial arousal. Excitement in both sexes Among both sexes, the excitement phase results in an increase in heart rate, breathing rate, and a rise in blood pressure. A survey in 2006 found that sexual arousal in about 82% of young females and 52% of young males arises or is enhanced by direct stimulation of nipples, with only 7‚Äì8% reporting that it decreased their arousal.The Journal of Sexual Medicine, Vol 3, May 2006. by Roy Levin. Vasocongestion of the skin, commonly referred to as the sex flush, will occur in approximately 50-75% of females and 25% of males. The sex flush tends to occur more often under warmer conditions and may not appear at all under cooler temperatures. During the female sex flush, pinkish spots develop under the breasts, then spread to the breasts, torso, face, hands, soles of the feet, and possibly over the entire body. Vasocongestion is also responsible for the darkening of the clitoris and the walls of the vagina during sexual arousal. During the male sex flush, the coloration of the skin develops less consistently than in the female, but typically starts with the epigastrium (upper abdomen), spreads across the chest, then continues to the neck, face, forehead, back, and sometimes, shoulders and forearms. The sex flush typically disappears soon after orgasm occurs, but this may take up to two hours or so and, sometimes, intense sweating will occur simultaneously. The flush usually diminishes in reverse of the order in which it appeared. An increase in muscle tone (myotonia) of certain muscle groups, occurring voluntarily and involuntarily, begins during this phase among both sexes. Also, the external anal sphincter may contract randomly upon contact (or later during orgasm without contact). Excitement in males In males, the beginning of the excitement phase is observed when the penis becomes partially or fully erect, often after only a few seconds of erotic stimulation. The erection may be partially lost and regained repeatedly during an extended excitement phase. Both testicles become drawn upward toward the perineum, notably in circumcised males where less skin is available to accommodate the erection. Also, the scrotum can tense and thicken during the erection process. Excitement in females In females, the excitement phase can last from several minutes to several hours. The onset of vasocongestion results in swelling of the woman's clitoris, labia minora and vagina. The muscle that surrounds the vaginal opening grows tighter and the uterus elevates and grows in size. The vaginal walls begin to produce a lubricating organic liquid. Meanwhile, the breasts increase slightly in size and nipples become hardened and erect.  Plateau phase  The plateau phase is the period of sexual excitement prior to orgasm. The phase is characterised by an increased circulation and heart rate in both sexes, increased sexual pleasure with increased stimulation and further increased muscle tension. Also, respiration continues at an elevated level. Both men and women may also begin to vocalize involuntarily at this stage. Prolonged time in the plateau phase without progression to the orgasmic phase may result in sexual frustration.  Plateau in males  During this phase, the male urethral sphincter contracts (so as to prevent urine from mixing with semen, and to guard against retrograde ejaculation) and muscles at the base of the penis begin a steady rhythmic contraction. Males may start to secrete seminal fluid or pre- ejaculatory fluid and the testicles rise closer to the body.  Plateau in females  The plateau stage in females is basically a continuation of the same changes evident in the excitement stage. The clitoris becomes extremely sensitive and withdraws slightly, and the Bartholin glands produce further lubrication. The tissues of the outer third of the vagina swell, and the pubococcygeus muscle tightens, reducing the diameter of the opening of the vagina. Masters and Johnson refer to the changes that take place during the plateau stage as the orgasmic platform. For those who never achieve orgasm, this is the peak of sexual excitement. Orgasm phase Orgasm is the conclusion of the plateau phase of the sexual response cycle and is experienced by both males and females. It is accompanied by quick cycles of muscle contraction in the lower pelvic muscles, which surround both the anus and the primary sexual organs. Women also experience uterine and vaginal contractions. Orgasms are often associated with other involuntary actions, including vocalizations and muscular spasms in other areas of the body and a generally euphoric sensation. Heart rate is increased even further.  Orgasm in males  In males, orgasm is usually associated with ejaculation. Each ejection is accompanied with continuous pulses of sexual pleasure, especially in the penis and loins. Other sensations may be felt strongly among the lower spine or lower back. The first and second convulsions are usually the most intense in sensation and produce the greatest quantity of semen. Thereafter, each contraction is associated with a diminishing volume of semen and a milder sensation of pleasure.  Orgasm in females  Orgasms in females can vary widely from woman to woman. The overall sensation is similar to that of the male orgasm. They are commonly associated with an increase in vaginal lubrication, a tightening of the vaginal walls and overall pleasure. Resolution phase The resolution phase occurs after orgasm and allows the muscles to relax, blood pressure to drop and the body to slow down from its excited state. The refractory period, which is part of the resolution phase, is the time frame in which usually a man is unable to orgasm again, though women can also experience a refractory period.  Resolution in males  Masters and Johnson described the two-stage detumescence of the penis: In the first stage, the penis decreases from its erect state to about 50 percent larger than its flaccid state. This occurs during the refractory period. In the second stage (and after the refractory period is finished), the penis decreases in size and returns to being flaccid. It is generally impossible for men to achieve orgasm during the refractory period. Masters and Johnson argue that this period must end before men can become aroused again.  Resolution in females  According to Masters and Johnson, women have the ability to orgasm again very quickly, as long as they have effective stimulation. As a result, they are able to have multiple orgasms in a relatively short period of time. Though generally reported that women do not experience a refractory period and thus can experience an additional orgasm, or multiple orgasms, soon after the first, some sources state that men and women experience a refractory period because women may also experience a period after orgasm in which further sexual stimulation does not produce excitement. For some women, the clitoris is very sensitive after climax, making additional stimulation initially painful. After the initial orgasm, subsequent orgasms for women may also be stronger or more pleasurable as the stimulation accumulates. Gender similarities and differences During the phase of sexual arousal, there is increased blood pressure in the genitals. This leads to swelling of the penis (above) or clitoris and labia (below). Masters and Johnson argue that, despite some minor differences, sexual responses in both men and women are fundamentally similar. However, researchers have argued that there are many differences between men and women in terms of their response. First, Masters and Johnson put forth one model for men, but three different models for women. They stated that men's sexual response only differs in terms of duration; showing different models would, thus, be repetitive. Women, on the other hand, they state can have responses that differ in both intensity and duration. These variations can pose problems because psychologists have argued that not everyone fits this model; for example, most women do not orgasm during penetrative sexual intercourse.Basson, R. (2000). The female sexual response: A different model. Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy 26, 51‚Äì65. Masters and Johnson also equate a man's erection with a woman's vaginal lubrication during the excitement phase; Roy Levin states that this observation is false. A woman's clitoris is the anatomical parallel to a man's penis. As a result, clitoral swelling would be the equivalent of a man's erection.Levin, R. J. (2008). Critically revising aspects of the human sexual response cycle of Masters and Johnson: Correcting errors and suggesting modifications. Sexual and Relationship Therapy 23(4), 393-399. Another aspect is the lack of concordance between subjective sexual arousal and genital arousal. Research by Meredith L. Chivers and J. Michael Bailey indicates that men tend to show category-specific arousal; that is, they are sexually aroused by their preferred gender. However, women show category non-specificity: Their genitals show arousal to both preferred and non-preferred genders.Chivers, M. L. & Bailey, J. M. (2005). A sex difference in features that elicit genital response. Biological Psychology, 70, 115-120.Chivers, M. L. (2005). A brief review and discussion of sex differences in the specificity of sexual arousal. Sexual and Relationship Therapy, 20(4), 377-390. Even though women reported being subjectively aroused to, for example, a man and woman engaging in sexual activity, their genitals also show sexual arousal to two men engaging in sexual activity, two women doing so, and even non-human animals having sex. Overall, Masters and Johnson's model appears to be a better example of men's sexual response than women's.Giles, K. R. & McCabe, M. P. (2009). Conceptualizing women's sexual function: Linear vs. circular models of sexual response. Journal of Sexual Medicine 6, 2761-2771. Criticisms There has been much research conducted based on Masters and Johnson's model. However, inaccuracies have been found in the descriptions of the stages of sexual response. For example, Roy Levin identified a few areas of the model that had not been touched upon.Levin, R. (2008). Critically revisiting aspects of the human sexual response cycle of Masters and Johnson: Correcting errors and suggesting modifications. Sexual and Relationship Therapy 23(4), 393-399. First, Masters and Johnson state that only the vagina is lubricated during the arousal stage; Levin argues that the labia produce their own lubricant. Levin also presents research which shows that the first signs of physiological arousal in women is increased blood flow to the vagina, not lubrication. He also dispels information about men and their sexual response; Masters and Johnson report that pleasure was positively associated with the volume of ejaculate released, but Rosenberg, Hazzard, Tallman and Ohl gave a group of men a questionnaire and found that significantly more men reported that physical pleasure was associated with the strength of the ejaculation compared to the volume.Rosenberg, M. T., Hazzard, M. A., Tallamn, C. T., & Ohl, D. A. (2006). Is the amount of physical pleasure with ejaculation related to volume or strength and force of ejaculation? The Journal of Sexual Medicine 3(s1), 14-69. Moreover, some researchers have found that some men can have multiple orgasms, despite what Masters and Johnson had reported.Hartman, W. & Fithian, M. (1984). Any man can: The multiple orgasmic technique for every loving man. New York: St. Martin‚Äôs Press.Zilbergeld, B. (1992). The new male sexuality. New York: Bantam Books. Some researchers have also criticized how Masters and Johnson define sexual response solely in terms of physiology; for example, Everaerd, and Laan have found that sexual arousal can be defined as an emotional state in both men and women.Both, S., Everaerd, W., Laan, E. (2003). Modulation of spinal reflexes by aversive and sexually appetitive stimuli. Psychophysiology, 40, 174-183. Other researchers have stated that there is a lack of concordance between women's subjective sexual arousal and their genital arousal. Rosemary Basson argues that this model poorly explains women's sexual response, especially for those who are in long-term relationships.Basson, R. (2001). Using a different model for female sexual response to address women‚Äôs problematic low sexual desire. Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy, 27, 395-403. Other models Shortly after Masters and Johnson published their book, several scholars criticized their model of the human sexual response cycle. For example, Helen Singer Kaplan argued that Masters and Johnson only evaluated sexual response from a physiological perspective, and that psychological, emotional, and cognitive factors need to be taken into consideration. As a result, she proposed her model of the sexual response cycle which includes three phases: desire, excitement, and orgasm. She argues that these three phases are interconnected, yet they have different neurophysiological mechanisms.Kaplan, H. S. Disorders of Sexual Desire. New York: Brunner/Mazel, Inc., 1979 Similarly, Paul Robinson argued that the excitement and plateau phases are the same; he criticizes Masters and Johnson's work for not clearly distinguishing when the excitement phase ends, and when the plateau phase begins.Robinson, P. The Modernization of Sex: Havelock Ellis, Alfred Kinsey, William Masters and Virginia Johnson. New York: Harper & Row, Publishers, 1976 Another model that has been put forth is the incentive-motivation model. The model explains that the desire for sex comes from an interaction between a sensitive sexual response system and stimuli that are present in the environment. Researchers argue that this model supports the idea that sexual desire is not spontaneous. Furthermore, this model implies that the case is not that one has sex because one feels sexual desire; rather, the case is that one feels sexual desire because one has sex.Laan, E. & Both, S. (2008). What makes women experience desire? Feminism & Psychology 18(4), 505-514. Rosemary Basson proposed an alternative model of sexual response. She argues that the linear model is good at explaining men's sexual response but it poorly explains women's sexual responses; thus, she puts forth a circular model. She states that closeness or attachment to a partner increases the effectiveness of sexual stimulation. This leads to enhanced sexual arousal, which may ultimately result in orgasm. Consequently, this positive sexual arousal continues the sexual desire that women feel, and this desire increases intimacy with the partner. Other researchers have attempted to evaluate women's sexual functioning in terms of this new model but have found contradictory results. In one study conducted by Giles and McCabe, they found that the linear model of sexual response was a good predictor of women's sexual functioning (and dysfunction), while the circular model was a poor predictor.Giles, K. R. & McCabe, M. P. (2009). Conceptualizing women's sexual function: Linear vs. circular models of sexual response. The Journal of Sexual Medicine 6, 2761-2771. Once they modified the pathways of the model, the circular model then became a good predictor of sexual functioning. In another study looking at Malaysian women, researchers found that the circular model was actually a good predictor of women's sexual desire and arousal.Sidi, H., Naing, L., Midin, M., and Nik Jaafar, N. R. (2008). The female sexual response cycle: Do Malaysian women conform to the circular model? The Journal of Sexual Medicine 5, 2359‚Äì2366. More research needs to be done in this area to show whether the circular model more accurately describes women's sexual response. Sexual dysfunctions The human sexual response cycle set the foundation for studying and categorizing sexual dysfunctions in men and women.Masters, W. H. & Johnson, V. E. (1970). Human Sexual Inadequacy. Toronto; New York: Bantam Books.Kaplan, H. S. (1974). The New Sex Therapy: Active Treatment of Sexual Dysfunctions. New York: Brunner/Mazel, Publishers, Inc. There are four main categories of sexual dysfunctions: desire disorders, arousal disorders, orgasm disorders, and sexual pain disorders. They are still categorized as such in the DSM-IV-TR. Recent research however, suggests that the current model of sexual response needs to be revised to better treat these dysfunctions. One reason is that there is considerable overlap between sexual dysfunctions in women.Balon, R., Segraves, R. T., & Clayton, A. (2007). Issues for DSM-V: Sexual dysfunction, disorder, or variation along normal distribution: Toward rethinking DSM criteria of sexual dysfunctions. American Journal of Psychiatry, 164(2), 198-200. One study found that in patients with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), 41% of women had at least one other sexual dysfunction and 18% had diagnoses in all 3 categories (that is, in desire, arousal, and orgasm disorders).Segraves, R. T. & Segraves, K. B. (1991). Hypoactive sexual desire disorder: Prevalence and comorbidity in 906 subjects. Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy, 17, 55-58. Another issue is that, among women, there is a discrepancy between desire and arousal. After Cynthia Graham critically evaluated female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD), she found that women reported that, contrary to Masters and Johnson's model, sexual arousal sometimes preceded sexual desire; at other times, desire presented before arousal.Graham, C. A. (2009). The DSM diagnostic criteria for female sexual arousal disorder. Archives of Sexual Behavior, 39, 240-255. Because of the high comorbidity rates between HSDD and FSAD, she would like to merge them to make the category \\"Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder.\\" Hartmann and colleagues summarize their views of the current model of the sexual response cycle and conclude that \\"by simply expanding and continuing DSM-IV criteria and the traditional response cycle classification systems, it is impossible to come to diagnostic categories and subtypes that adequately reflect real-life female sexual problems\\".Hartmann, U., Heiser, K., Ruffer-Hesse, C., & Kloth, G. (2002). Female sexual desire disorders: Subtypes, classification, personality factors and new directions for treatment. World Journal of Urology, 20, 79-88.

Its local government area is the City of Melbourne. Carlton is known nationwide for its Little Italy precinct centered on Lygon Street, for its preponderance of 19th century Victorian architecture and its garden squares including the Carlton Gardens, the latter being the location of the Royal Exhibition Building, one of Australia's few man-made sites with World Heritage status. Due to its proximity to The University of Melbourne, the CBD campus of RMIT University and the Fitzroy campus of Australian Catholic University, Carlton is also home to one of the highest concentrations of university students in Australia. History Carlton was founded in 1851 at the beginning of the Victorian Gold Rush, with the Carlton Post Office opening on 19 October 1865.. In the 1930s, many of the homes on the streets in Carlton were known to be slum pockets and owned by poor residents. In the 1960s, residents were forced to sell their homes to the Housing Commission of Victoria, since then some areas of Carlton have been under residential and commercial redevelopment, while other areas survived and have remained remarkably intact. Squizzy Taylor an Australian gangster was wounded in a gunfight with a rival gangster, John \\"Snowy\\" Cutmore, in 1927 at a house in Barkly Street, Carlton and later died at St Vincent's Hospital. In the 1970s, Carlton was the site of three green bans, one on abandoned land where local residents wanted a park and a developer wanted a warehouse, now the Hardy-Gallagher Reserve (named after Labor councillor Fred Hardy and Norm Gallagher). Another which converted a vacant lot on Cardigan street to a park and another that saved local terrace housing. The Carlton Magistrates' Court closed on 1 February 1985. Urban structure Housing Double storey terraces on Drummond street, typical of much of Carlton's residential districts Housing commission in Carlton. Carlton is characterized by medium- to high-density housing, with a mix of apartments and student accommodation, attached and semidetached terraces mostly from the Victorian era and mix-use buildings Apartments (83.2%) are the most common form of housing. Carlton's apartments are low incomes, including crisis and student accommodation, with Housing Commission of Victoria towers and modern student apartment buildings. The two main housing commission estates are between Lygon and Rathdowne Streets, and between Nicholson and Canning Streets. These are configured as a mixture of 4 and 5-storey walk-up flats and 22-storey high-rise towers which are in the process of being redeveloped as mixed-tenure housing. 76.8% of Carlton's housing is rented, the vast majority of which is concentrated in these apartment towers. The development of new apartment buildings to accommodate international student market since the late 1990s has transformed the once low-rise skyline of Swanston Street, so that its predominant height is about 10‚Äì11 storeys. Some strata-titled apartments are clustered fronting suburb's parks and gardens. Semi-detached housing makes up most of the remaining occupied private dwellings (14.7%). Much of this type of housing is the suburb's remaining stock of terrace houses which proliferated in the Victorian era. Today these homes are highly sought after, attract high prices and have been the primary of gentrification. Many are contained within heritage overlays and have individual heritage listings. Some of the best examples of this style can be found on Drummond Street, a long wide boulevard flanked by grand homes, including Rosaville (no46 built 1883), Drummond Terrace (no 93-105 built 1890‚Äì91), Lothian Terrace (no175-179 built 1865‚Äì69), Terraces at 313&315 (1889). Though many terraces in Carlton no longer function as residences and have either been converted for mixed-use or facaded as part of larger developments. In the 12-month period to January 2020 Carlton reported a median house price of A$620,000 for a two bedroom unit. Public spaces Carlton Gardens Carlton's public spaces were planned in the Victorian era and notably are all garden squares. These are rectilinear green spaces surrounded by buildings, based on a model fashionable in Europe. There are five main garden squares within the suburb ‚Äì Carlton Gardens, University Square, Lincoln Square, Argyle Place and MacArthur Place. The largest of these squares is the 26 hectare Carlton Gardens, planned for the World Exhibition. Lincoln Square on Swanston Street has a Bali Memorial, commemorating the victims of the 2002 Bali bombings officially opened on 12 October 2005, the third anniversary of the explosion that killed 202 innocent people, including 88 Australians. The northern part of Argyle Square, adjacent to Lygon Street, has been redeveloped into an Italian style piazza, known as Piazza Italia, in a joint project between the City of Melbourne and its twin city, Milan. A giant sundial is the main feature of the piazza. Little Italy Little Italy, Melbourne, also sometimes referred to as the \\"Italian Precinct\\" or simply \\"Lygon Street\\", is a \\"Little Italy\\" cultural precinct centred around Lygon Street in Carlton. Lygon Street is home to a large concentration of Italian restaurants, and is the birthplace of Melbourne's \\"caf√© culture\\". Culture Arts La Mama Theatre The famous La Mama Theatre is located in Carlton. It is noted for its energy, which is typical of the early Australian theatre scene in the 1970s. Besides that, Cinema Nova on Lygon Street shows many Australian and international art-house films, while Readings Bookstore has been a hub for literary and musical connoisseurs since the 1970s. The 1977 cult-classic novel Monkey Grip by Helen Garner is set in Carlton and its surroundings. Landmarks and heritage Royal Exhibition Building on Rathdowne Street Carlton is home to some of Melbourne's most historically significant buildings such as Melbourne Trades Hall and the World Heritage Site of the Carlton Gardens, the Royal Exhibition Building and the ruins of the old Carlton Brewery, a collection of buildings constructed between 1864 and 1927, all listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. The Carlton Gardens are also home to the Melbourne Museum. Carlton has many 19th century public buildings. The Carlton Club, which was built in 1889 by Inskip & Robertson, is notable for its decorative Australian native kangaroo gargoyles and polychrome Florentine arches. The Carlton Post Office and Police Station are both fine Renaissance Revival styled buildings. The Carlton Court House on Drummond Street was designed in the Gothic style by G.B.H Austin and constructed between 1888 and 1889. The Lygon Buildings on Lygon Street were built in 1888 in the Mannerist style. Carlton Gardens Primary School, on Rathdowne Street, opened in 1884. The Police Station (no330 built 1878), Court House (no345-355 built 1887‚Äì88) and Medley Hall (no48 built 1892‚Äì93) are other notable heritage buildings. Sport Carlton is the home of the Australian rules football club, the Carlton Football Club (known as 'the Blues'), who are based at their former home ground, the Princes Park Football Ground, in nearby North Carlton. The club plays home games at the Docklands Stadium and the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Lygon Street, Grattan Street and Queensberry Street were part of the route of the marathon in the 2006 Commonwealth Games, which was hosted in Melbourne. Lygon and Cardigan Streets are part of the seventh course of the annual cycling tour, Jayco Herald Sun Tour. Economy and commerce Lygon Street, which runs through the heart of Carlton, is a centre of Italian culture and cuisine. It is popular among Melburnians and foreigners alike for its numerous restaurants, especially Italian restaurants. Lygon Street has six specialist gelaterias, and several continental cake cafes. Although Lygon Street is most renowned for its cafes and restaurants, it is also home to some notable retail stores including Readings bookstore. Demographics In the 2016 Census, there were 18,535 people in Carlton. 27.3% of people were born in Australia. The most common countries of birth were China 22.6%, Malaysia 6.4%, Indonesia 3.1%, India 2.6% and Singapore 2.3%. 33.8% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 25.7%, Cantonese 4.3%, Indonesian 2.8%, Somali 2.3% and Arabic 2.1%. The most common responses for religion was No Religion at 47.5%. The area is noted for its diverse population that has been the home in earlier days of Jewish and Italian immigrants. A large number of low-income residents live in the substantial public housing estates that were built during the 1960s. Carlton also has a sizeable tertiary student population, local and international, due to its proximity to the University of Melbourne and RMIT University. 61.8% of Carlton residents were attending an educational institution. Of these, 68.6%, or 7,852 residents, were attending a university or tertiary institution. Politics Carlton falls within the federal electorate of Melbourne (currently held by Adam Bandt of The Greens) and the state electorate of Melbourne (currently held by Ellen Sandell of The Greens). A traditional working-class suburb, it traditionally saw a high vote for the ALP. However, like many other inner-city suburbs undergoing a process of gentrification, The Greens have been gaining an increasing share of the vote. The suburb contains three polling booths (Carlton, Carlton Central and Carlton South), which collectively produced the following primary-vote results at the 2019 federal election: Greens 2534 or 62.58%; Labor 668 or 16.5%; Liberal 605 or 14.94%; Reason 212 or 5.24% and United Australia 30 or 0.74%. Infrastructure Education Alan Gilbert Building, University of Melbourne at University Square in Carlton Due to Carlton's close proximity to the Parkville campus of the University of Melbourne, many university-owned buildings can be found around Carlton, as a result of the university's expansion through the years. This includes the University Square redevelopment, where the state-of-the-art Law and ICT buildings and a new underground carpark are located. However, the University's continued expansion into Carlton is opposed by some residents. Two of the University's residential colleges are located in Carlton; Medley Hall is located on Drummond Street, while Graduate House is on Leicester Street. Graduate House is a residential college for graduate students only and does not admit any undergraduate students. Melbourne Business School, Melbourne Law School and part of RMIT University's City Campus are also located in Carlton. Victoria and Tasmania's Catholic seminary, Corpus Christi College, is located on Drummond Street. The college accommodates forty seminarians who are studying to become priests. Primary education is provided by two schools; Carlton Gardens Primary School and Carlton Primary School. CGPS was founded in 1884 and is one of Melbourne's oldest schools and the closest to the Melbourne CBD. The Melbourne University Regiment (MUR) is based in Grattan Street, Carlton. MUR serves to train potential officers in the Australian Army Reserve. MUR was founded in 1884 as D company, 4th Battalion of the Victorian Rifles, and changed to its current name and role in 1948. Famous alumni include Sir John Monash, Sir Robert Menzies, Sir Ninian Stephen, Barry Humphries, and Andrew Peacock..Melbourne University Regiment Health Carlton is also very well serviced by the health sector. The Royal Women's Hospital and the new Royal Dental Hospital provide high quality health care. It is also a centre of biomedical research. The Cancer Research Institute and the Australian College of Optometry all have their premises in Carlton. Carlton is the home of NETS (Victoria) which provides emergency transport of sick newborns between hospitals throughout Victoria and from Tasmania. It was also the home of Cancer Council Victoria for many years before moving to St Kilda Rd. Places of worship There are a number of churches in Carlton, which serve the spiritual needs of Carlton residents. St Jude's Church, on Lygon Street, is one of the most active and well attended Anglican churches in the Greater Melbourne area. Other churches in the area include the bluestone Church of All Nations (a Uniting Church) in Palmerston Street dating from 1860, a Romanian Orthodox Church on Queensberry Street, a Salvation Army Church, the Sacred Heart Catholic Church, Chinese Church of Christ and the Christian Chapel of the Church of Christ, built in 1865. The Catholic seminary is located on the site of St George's Catholic Church, Carlton's oldest surviving building, dating from 1855. Lygon Street Church of Christ built 1865. Transport Z3 tram near the corner of Elgin and Lygon Streets Carlton is served by many of Melbourne's tram routes, running along Swanston Street and terminating at Melbourne University. Routes 1 and 6 continue through to Carlton North and beyond via Lygon Street. Buses serve Carlton via Lygon, Elgin, and Rathdowne Streets. There are currently no trains to Carlton, with the closest station being Melbourne Central Station. There were talks and proposals of extending the City Loop to service Carlton, but no concrete plans have been proposed. Rod Eddington's East West Link Needs Assessment does mention however, that there will be subway(s) in Carlton, as a part of the proposed 17 km metro tunnel.\\"melbourne metro ‚Äì ‚Äònew generation‚Äô rail tunnel\\" Notable residents * Newman-Morris, Sir John (1879 - 1957), medical practitioner and humanitarian * Ritchie, Sir Thomas Malcolm (1894 - 1971), electrical engineer and Liberal Party president * Sir Carleton Kemp Allen (1887 - 1966), scholar * Kalev Vann (1956‚Äì2011), Australian rules footballer * Very Rev Alexander Yule (1830-1907) Moderator of Victoria in 1891 and of the Federal Assembly of Australia in 1901 See also *St Jude's Church, Carlton References External links *Australian Places: C En *Melbourne University Regiment Restaurant districts and streets in Australia Suburbs of Melbourne Little Italys in Australia Slums in Australia Green bans ","title":"Carlton, Victoria"},{"id":"702659","text":"Bankwest, previously known as The Bank of Western Australia, is an Australian full-service bank based in Perth, Western Australia. It was sold in October 2008 to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia for 2.1 billion and operates as a division of its parent company. Bankwest also has offices in Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney.  History  Bankwest Tower in Perth, the company's former headquarters In 1895, the Government of Western Australia established the Agricultural Bank of Western Australia as a rural lender to support the State's farming industries. Despite its name, it was technically not a bank, in that it did not collect deposits from the public, its liabilities being government bonds. It was a government instrumentality that lent exclusively to farmers. In 1945, the Agricultural Bank became a full trading bank and changed its name to the Rural and Industries Bank of Western Australia (also known as R&I; Bank). This enabled it to expand its retail and commercial banking services throughout the state. In 1956 it became a savings bank, and in 1985 the first Sydney branch opened. The bank was incorporated in 1990, and then in 1994 changed its name to the Bank of Western Australia Limited, with the trading name Bankwest, in preparation for privatisation. In December 1995, the Bank of Scotland acquired the bank, and as part of the sale agreement, offered 49 per cent of the shares in Bankwest to the public. Bankwest shares listed on the Australian Stock Exchange on 1 February 1996. In 2001, Halifax Group (a large UK financial institution) merged with Bank of Scotland to form HBOS plc. HBOS then acquired all the outstanding shares of Bankwest, making it HBOS's wholly owned subsidiary. In 2003, Bankwest announced the acquisition of API Finance from Australian Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (API) for $300m in line with its industry specialisation growth strategy in the business banking segment. Late in 2006, Bankwest announced it would be leaving their landmark tower, in favour of a new complex at Raine Square. In early June 2008, reports began to circulate that HBOS intended to sell Bankwest. In September 2008, Lloyds TSB bought HBOS in a deal worth over ¬£12.2 billion. This was followed in October 2008 when, with significant problems of their own, HBOS/Lloyds TSB agreed to the sale of Bankwest and St Andrews Insurances to Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) for an initial purchase price of 2.1 billion. Products and services Bankwest offers a full range of banking products, including loans (home loans, car credits, personal loans), credit cards transaction and savings accounts.http://bankchart.com.au/catalogue/banks/id/23 In 2007, Bankwest launched the Bankwest Regular Saver account for individuals. In 2012 Bankwest launched the Student Edge debit card linked to their Student account. In 2016, Bankwest terminated its share trading platform and all Bankwest online share trading accounts were closed on 31 May 2016.https://bankwest.coretrading.com.au/public/homepage/announcements.aspx?id=bkwstannouncement14  Branch closures  On 18 July 2018, Bankwest announced plans to close 29 branches in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland from 17 August to 7 September. Bankwest managing director Rowan Munchenberg said an overwhelming number of its customers were choosing to bank online, prompting the closure of the stores.  Controversies  In December 2011, a former Bankwest commercial client Geoff Shannon started an action group and website called \\"Unhappy Banking\\",Unhappy Banking web site after losing \\"all of [his] company and personal assets due to the predatory conduct of Bankwest\\". The group claims that Bankwest \\"moved aggressively to reduce its exposure to small- and medium- sized commercial property clients\\" after being taken over by the Commonwealth Bank in 2008. After lobbying by Unhappy Banking, a Senate Inquiry was announced into banking practices on 14 March 2012. In August 2013 Shannon lost his case against Bankwest, with Supreme Court Judge Sackar referring to Shannon as an \\"unreliable witness\\".

He served several months after statehood in 1890 and then became one of the state's first United States Senators. Early life Lena Shoup Laura and Margaret Shoup Born in Kittanning, Pennsylvania, northeast of Pittsburgh, Shoup was educated in the public school system. He moved to Galesburg, Illinois, in 1852 and farmed with his father. He married Magdelena \\"Lena\\" Darnutzer of Iowa on June 15, 1868, and they had three sons and three daughters, Lena, Laura and Margaret. Career After being devastated financially in the Panic of 1857, Shoup moved to Colorado Territory in 1859 to engage in mining and merchandising near Pikes Peak and later in Denver. During the Civil War, he enlisted with the independent scouts working in New Mexico Territory, Colorado Territory, and Texas. Shoup was commissioned as a second lieutenant when the Third Colorado Cavalry was formed in 1861 and was mustered out as a colonel in December 1864. He took part in the Battle of Apache Canyon in New Mexico Territory during the Civil War and the Sand Creek massacre during the Colorado War.Page 148 and pages 162 and 163, Life of George Bent: Written From His Letters, by George E. Hyde, edited by Savoie Lottinville, University of Oklahoma Press (1968), hardcover, 390 pages; trade paperback, 280 pages (March 1983) After the war, Shoup moved to Virginia City, Montana Territory, and then settled across the continental divide in Salmon, a city in Idaho Territory that he helped found. He owned general merchandise stores in both locations. Shoup was appointed commissioner to organize Lemhi County, and in 1874 he was elected to the territorial legislature. With few interruptions, he served on the Republican National Committee for Idaho from 1880 to 1904. In April 1889, President Benjamin Harrison appointed Shoup governor of Idaho Territory, a position he held until July 1890, when Idaho became a state and Idaho Territory ceased to exist. Shoup was elected the state's first governor in October. He served as governor of the new state for only a few weeks. In November 1890 the Idaho Legislature elected him to the U.S. Senate. Shoup resigned as governor in December to take his Senate seat and was succeeded by lieutenant governor N. B. Willey. In the U.S. Senate for over a decade, from 1890 to 1901, Shoup had many interests, including pensions, education, and military affairs. He was chairman of the Committee on Territories. In that position he advocated liberal and just treatment of the Native Americans. Shoup was reelected to a full six-year term in the Senate by the state legislature in January 1895, but was defeated in January 1901 by Democrat Fred Dubois, and retired from public life and resided in Boise. Two years later at age 66, Shoup made a final attempt to return to the U.S. Senate, but bowed out of the four-man race for the Republican nomination in the legislature in January 1903. He gave his support to fellow Pennsylvania native Weldon Heyburn of the Silver Valley, who defeated Boise attorney William Borah for the nomination and Democrat James Hawley of Boise for the seat. Four years later, Borah easily won the other U.S. Senate seat, and served for nearly 33 years. Death Shoup died in Boise, Idaho at the age 68 on December 21, 1904, and was given a state funeral in Idaho. He is interred in Boise's Pioneer Cemetery, alongside his wife Lena, who died in Salmon, Idaho in 1927. Legacy NSHC) In 1910, the state of Idaho donated a marble statue of Shoup to the National Statuary Hall Collection at the U.S. Capitol. It was joined by a statue of Senator Borah (1865‚Äì1940) in 1947. The unincorporated community of Shoup, Idaho on the Salmon River, northwest and downstream of Salmon, was named for him in 1882. During World War II, a Liberty ship named S.S. George L. Shoup (hull #2004) was launched at the Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation in Portland in May 1943. A new men's dormitory at the University of Idaho in Moscow was named for him in 1958. Shoup's papers were donated to the University of Idaho, having been gathered by his son William and presented by his grandson, G. Elmo Shoup.

It is a special pawn that can only occur immediately after a pawn makes a move of two squares from its starting square, and it could have been captured by an enemy pawn had it advanced only one square. The opponent captures the just-moved pawn \\"as it passes\\" through the first square. The result is the same as if the pawn had advanced only one square and the enemy pawn had captured it normally. The en passant capture must be made on the very next turn or the right to do so is lost. En passant capture is a common theme in chess compositions. The en passant capture rule was added in the 15th century when the rule that gave pawns an initial double-step move was introduced. It prevents a pawn from using the two-square advance to pass an adjacent enemy pawn without the risk of being captured. Conditions Animation of 1‚Ä¶d5 and 2.exd6e.p. A pawn on its fifth may capture an enemy pawn on an adjacent that has moved two squares in a single move, as if the pawn had moved only one square. The conditions are: * the capturing pawn must be on its fifth rank; * the captured pawn must be on an adjacent file and must have just moved two squares in a single move (i.e. a double-step move); * the capture can only be made on the move immediately after the enemy pawn makes the double-step move; otherwise, the right to capture it en passant is lost. { align=\\"center\\" -valign=\\"top\\" + Example of en passant    } En passant is a unique privilege of pawns‚Äîother pieces cannot capture en passant. It is the only capture in chess in which the capturing piece does not replace the captured piece on its square. Notation In either algebraic or descriptive chess notation, en passant captures are sometimes denoted by \\"e.p.\\" or similar, but such notation is not required. In algebraic notation, the capturing move is written as if the captured pawn advanced only one square; for example, ...bxa3 or ...bxa3e.p. (see beginning illustration). Examples In the opening There are some examples of en passant in chess openings. In this line from Petrov's Defence, White can capture the pawn on d5 en passant on his sixth move. :1. e4 e5 :2. Nf3 Nf6 :3. d4 exd4 :4. e5 Ne4 :5. Qxd4 d5 (diagram) :6. exd6e.p. Another example occurs in the French Defence after 1.e4 e6 2.e5, a move once advocated by Wilhelm Steinitz. If Black responds with 2...d5, White can capture the pawn en passant with 3.exd6e.p. Likewise, White can answer 2...f5 with 3.exf6e.p. An example is from this game by Steinitz and Bernhard Fleissig. :1. e4 e6 :2. e5 d5 :3. exd6e.p. Unusual examples In the diagram, if Black plays 1...g5+, it seems to checkmate White, but it is in fact a blunder. Black overlooks that White can counter this check with the en passant capture 2. fxg6e.p.#, which cross-checks and checkmates Black. This game is a draw if neither side errs. { align=\\"right\\" -valign=\\"top\\" + Gundersen vs. Faul, 1928   } Another example is this game between Gunnar Gundersen and Albert H. Faul. Black has just moved his pawn from f7 to f5. White could capture the f-pawn en passant with his e-pawn, but instead played: :13. h5+ Kh6 14. Nxe6+ The bishop on c1 effects a discovered check. 14...Kh7 results in 15.Qxg7. :14... g5 15. hxg6e.p.# The en passant capture and discovered checks place Black in checkmate (from White's rook on h1, even without help from White's bishop). An en passant capture is the only way a double check can be delivered without one of the checking pieces moving, as in this case. The largest known number of en passant captures in one game is three, shared by three games; in none of them were all three captures by the same player. The earliest known example is a 1980 game between Alexandru Sorin Segal and Karl Heinz Podzielny.A. Segal vs. K. Podzielny, Dortmund 1980. Published by 365Chess.com. Retrieved on 2009-12-05. In chess compositions En passant captures have often been used as a theme in chess compositions, as they \\"produce striking effects in the opening and closing of lines\\". In the 1938 composition by Kenneth S. Howard, the move 1. d4 introduces the threat of 2.d5+ cxd5 3.Bxd5#. Black can capture the d4-pawn en passant in either of two ways: * The capture 1... exd3e.p. shifts the e4-pawn from the e- to the d-file, preventing an en passant capture after White plays 2. f4. To stop the threatened mate (3.f5#), Black can advance 2... f5, but this allows White to play 3. exf6e.p. with checkmate due to the decisive opening of the . * If Black plays 1... cxd3e.p., White exploits the newly opened a2‚Äìg8 diagonal with 2. Qa2+ d5 3. cxd6e.p.# An example showing the effect en passant captures have on pins is this 1902 composition by Sommerfeldt:Open chess diary by Tim Krabb√© - #234 The move :1. d4 threatens 2.Qf2#. The moves of the black e-pawn are restricted in an unusual manner. The en passant capture 1...exd3e.p.+ is illegal (it exposes the king to check), but :1... e3+ is legal. This, however, removes the black king's access to e3, allowing :2. d5# Historical context Allowing the en passant capture, together with the introduction of the two-square first move for pawns, was one of the last major rule changes in European chess, and occurred between 1200 and 1600. (Spanish master Ruy L√≥pez de Segura gives the rule in his 1561 book Libro de la invencion liberal y arte del juego del axedrez ) and a change to the rules on pawn promotion. In most places the en passant rule was adopted at the same time as allowing the pawn to move two squares on its first move, but it was not universally accepted until the Italian rules were changed in 1880. The motivation for en passant was to prevent the newly added two-square first move for pawns from allowing a pawn to evade capture by an enemy pawn. Asian chess variants, because of their separation from European chess prior to that period, do not feature any of these moves. Threefold repetition and stalemate The possibility of an en passant capture is relevant to the claim of a draw by threefold repetition. Two positions with the same configuration of pieces, with the same player to move, are for this purpose considered different if there was an opportunity to make an en passant capture in the first position, and that opportunity no longer exists in the second position. In his book on chess organization and rules, International Arbiter Kenneth Harkness wrote that it is frequently asked if an en passant capture must be made if it is the only legal move. This point was debated in the 19th century, with some arguing that the right to make an en passant capture is a \\"privilege\\" that one cannot be compelled to exercise. In his 1860 book Chess Praxis, Howard Staunton wrote that the en passant capture is mandatory in that instance. The rules of chess were amended to make this clear. Today, it is settled that the player must make that move (or resign). The same is true if an en passant capture is the only move to get out of check.

Auditory perception has advantages in temporal, spatial, amplitude, and frequency resolution that open possibilities as an alternative or complement to visualization techniques. For example, the rate of clicking of a Geiger counter conveys the level of radiation in the immediate vicinity of the device. Though many experiments with data sonification have been explored in forums such as the International Community for Auditory Display (ICAD), sonification faces many challenges to widespread use for presenting and analyzing data. For example, studies show it is difficult, but essential, to provide adequate context for interpreting sonifications of data. Many sonification attempts are coded from scratch due to the lack of a flexible tool for sonification research and data exploration History The Geiger counter, invented in 1908, is one of the earliest and most successful applications of sonification. A Geiger counter has a tube of low-pressure gas; each particle detected produces a pulse of current when it ionizes the gas, producing an audio click. The original version was only capable of detecting alpha particles. In 1928, Geiger and Walther M√ºller (a PhD student of Geiger) improved the counter so that it could detect more types of ionizing radiation. In 1913, Dr. Edmund Fournier d'Albe of University of Birmingham invented the optophone, which used selenium photosensors to detect black print and convert it into an audible output. A blind reader could hold a book up to the device and hold an apparatus to the area she wanted to read. The optophone played a set group of notes: g c' d' e' g' b' c e. Each note corresponded with a position on the optophone's reading area, and that note was silenced if black ink was sensed. Thus, the missing notes indicated the positions where black ink was on the page and could be used to read. Pollack and Ficks published the first perceptual experiments on the transmission of information via auditory display in 1954. They experimented with combining sound dimensions such as timing, frequency, loudness, duration, and spacialization and found that they could get subjects to register changes in multiple dimensions at once. These experiments did not get into much more detail than that, since each dimension had only two possible values. John M. Chambers, Max Mathews, and F.R. Moore at Bell Laboratories did the earliest work on auditory graphing in their \\"Auditory Data Inspection\\" technical memorandum in 1974. They augmented a scatterplot using sounds that varied along frequency, spectral content, and amplitude modulation dimensions to use in classification. They did not do any formal assessment of the effectiveness of these experiments. In 1976, philosopher of technology, Don Ihde, wrote, \\"Just as science seems to produce an infinite set of visual images for virtually all of its phenomena--atoms to galaxies are familiar to us from coffee table books to science magazines; so 'musics,' too, could be produced from the same data that produces visualizations.\\" This appears to be one of the earliest references to sonification as a creative practice. In the 1980s, pulse oximeters came into widespread use. Pulse oximeters can sonify oxygen concentration of blood by emitting higher pitches for higher concentrations. However, in practice this particular feature of pulse oximeters may not be widely utilized by medical professionals because of the risk of too many audio stimuli in medical environments. In 1992, the International Community for Auditory Display (ICAD) was founded by Gregory Kramer as a forum for research on auditory display which includes data sonification. ICAD has since become a home for researchers from many different disciplines interested in the use of sound to convey information through its conference and peer-reviewed proceedings.

Often, an increase or decrease in some level in this information is indicated by an increase or decrease in pitch, amplitude or tempo, but could also be indicated by varying other less commonly used components. For example, a stock market price could be portrayed by rising pitch as the stock price rose, and lowering pitch as it fell. To allow the user to determine that more than one stock was being portrayed, different timbres or brightnesses might be used for the different stocks, or they may be played to the user from different points in space, for example, through different sides of their headphones. Many studies have been undertaken to try to find the best techniques for various types of information to be presented, and as yet, no conclusive set of techniques to be used has been formulated. As the area of sonification is still considered to be in its infancy, current studies are working towards determining the best set of sound components to vary in different situations. Several different techniques for auditory rendering of data can be categorized: * Acoustic Sonification Barrass S.

Scan Journal of Media Arts Culture, Macquarie University online The present offerings for sonification software are relatively few, with many offerings either taking the form of specified programs for sonification of data or functions built into existing frameworks. Some examples of these are: * SoniPy, an open source Python framework * Sonification Sandbox, a Java program to convert datasets to sounds * xSonify, a Java application to display numerical data as sound * Sound and sonification functions in the Wolfram Language * audiolyzR, an R package for data sonification * Data-to-Music API, a browser-based JavaScript API for real-time data sonification * Mozzi, a sonification synth for the open source Arduino platform In addition to the software listed above, other tools commonly used to build sonifications include: * Csound * Max * Pure Data * SuperCollider An alternative approach to traditional sonification is \\"sonification by replacement\\", for example Pulsed Melodic Affective Processing (PMAP). In PMAP rather than sonifying a data stream, the computational protocol is musical data itself, for example MIDI. The data stream represents a non-musical state: in PMAP an affective state. Calculations can then be done directly on the musical data, and the results can be listened to with the minimum of translation.

It is available either directly as a liquid or as an impregnated wadding pad. History Brasso originated in Britain in about 1905. Because of the hydrocarbon components in the mixture it had a flash point of 72 ¬∞F (Abel Close test) and so was classed by railway companies as dangerous goods. This classification allowed the railway companies to charge more for distributing Brasso around the country. Reckitt's appealed to the companies asking for the polish to be recategorized in the hope of reducing costs, but the railways disagreed. As a result of this in 1913 the case was taken to Railway and Canal Commissioners for a decision. After a hearing lasting two days the commissioners decided in favour of the railway companies, and Brasso remained classed as a dangerous substance for the purposes of railway transport.Railway And Canal Commission.\\" Times [London, England] 22 May 1913: 22. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 13 Sept. 2018. In the early 20thC Reckitt & Sons' senior traveller, W.H. Slack, visited the company's Australian branch, where he discovered such a product in use. Samples from Australian and US producers were then analysed by Reckitt's chemists, and by 1920 liquid polish under the trademark \\"Brasso\\" was being sold, initially to railways, hospitals, hotels, and large shops. The polish grew in popularity in Britain, becoming widely available, eventually replacing the previous paste-style polishes. It has undergone very few changes in either composition or package design over the past century. Cans are often collected as a typical example of classic British advertising design. In the US, the current Brasso product is not the same as the legacy product. The manufacturer, Reckitt Benckiser, has not produced the impregnated wadding version of the product for many years. The formula changed in 2008 to comply with US volatile organic compounds law, and the metal bottle was replaced by a plastic one. In 2010, Brasso brought out a new product, Brasso Gadgetcare. Gadgetcare is a versatile, non-abrasive gel that can be used on everything from LCD TV screens, laptop screens, computers, smart phones, and PDAs. The plastic bottle is 50ml and is sold with a microfibre cloth. Ingredients The label of Australian Brasso lists \\"Liquid Hydrocarbons 630g/L; Ammonia 5g/L\\", whereas the material safety data sheet for Brasso in North America lists: isopropyl alcohol 3‚Äì5%, ammonia 5‚Äì10%, silica powder 15‚Äì20% and oxalic acid 0‚Äì3% as the ingredients. However, the Australian version contains kaolin instead of silica for abrasives. The online data sheet for Brasso wadding in the UK lists the ingredients as C8-10 Alkane/Cycloalkane/Aromatic Hydrocarbons, Quartz, C14-18 and C16-18 unsaturated Fatty acids, Kaolinite, Aqua, Ammonium Hydroxide and Iron Hydroxide. Brasso liquid lists a slightly different mix; C8-10 Alkane/Cycloalkane/Aromatic Hydrocarbons, Quartz, Kaolin, C12-20 Saturated and Unsaturated Monobasic Fatty Acids, Aqua and Ammonium Hydroxide. Also available are ingredients in a discontinued recipe for Brasso. Wadding: C8-10 Alkane/Cycloalkane/Aromatic Hydrocarbons, Quartz, Ammonium Tallate and Colorant. Liquid: C8-10 Alkane/Cycloalkane/Aromatic Hydrocarbons, Quartz, Kaolin and Ammonium Tallate.  Other applications  Brasso can also be used to polish out scratches in plastics: *It is used to polish CDs, DVDs, screens, and pools to repair scratches. It is a mild solvent and an extremely fine abrasive, so when applied to the reflective surface of the disc and rubbed radially (in straight lines between the edge and centre), it can smooth scratches and reduce their effect.Understanding and Servicing CD Players, Ken Clements, p 177Big Book of Apple Hacks, Chris Seibold, p 584 ‚Äì 585Restoring a Damaged CD *Brasso can also be used on Lego minifigures to remove markings. *Brasso has also been used by watch enthusiasts to polish scratches out of acrylic crystals on watches.

For most of his time on the series, Greene's role was that of a mediator and occasional authority figure, and he was considered the main character of the series for the first eight seasons. Greene was also the only original character to die. Early life Mark Greene, an only child, was raised by his mother, Ruth, and father, David. David Greene served in the United States Navy, and thus the family moved frequently and lived all over the country, including: Jacksonville, Florida, Norfolk, Virginia, Corpus Christi, Texas, Washington D.C., Kings Bay, Georgia, and Hawaii, where they spent three years, David's longest assignment. Mark had a very strained relationship with his father, and was decidedly closer to his mother. He would often act out in an attempt to upset his father, and aimed his goals in the opposite of what his father wanted. Mark thought his father's Navy career mattered more to him than his family, only to later learn that David was on track to be an Admiral and turned down the chance in order to come home and help Mark with a bully. The most memorable time of his childhood was when his family was in Hawaii, a time he would later recreate with daughter Rachel during the last few weeks of his life. While still in high school, Greene met and soon after developed a romantic relationship with Jennifer (Jen). Presumably their relationship lasted the duration of their time in college, and at some point around the time Greene was at medical school, he married Jennifer. His daughter, Rachel was born shortly afterwards. While in medical school, he met future colleague Doug Ross. He then completed his internship and residency in the Emergency Department of County General Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, from there he was awarded the position of Chief Resident of the Emergency Department. While there, Greene developed close friendships with Dr. Doug Ross, a pediatrician, Dr. Susan Lewis, an ER resident, and nurse manager, Carol Hathaway. Although Greene enjoys working the ER, his marriage has been strained by the many nights on call, and the long hours, and wife Jen's decision to complete law school. History  In the pilot episode, which takes place on St. Patrick's Day 1994, Dr. Greene, the chief resident, is awakened in the first scene to help his long-time friend Doug, the emergency pediatric fellow who often comes in to sober up on his nights off. Also, his close friendship with Susan is shown as they confide in each other about their personal lives while on break. During the same episode, Jen gets Mark to visit a private practice near the hospital to explore the possibility of leaving his job at the ER and get more family- friendly hours. Greene decides the \\"clean\\" medicine isn't his cup of tea. Back at the ER, Greene removes a hangnail from an older woman, who wanted him to remove it despite the fact she'd be charged $180. Later during the night, Greene has to urge everyone to get back to work when Carol is rushed into the ER after a shocking suicide attempt. During the first season, Dr. Greene's marriage becomes increasingly shaky. When offered an attending physician's position by David Morgenstern, Greene readily accepts, much to Jen's chagrin. As a newly admitted member of the bar, Jen has been clerking for a judge in Milwaukee, and becomes increasingly tired of commuting and living separately to accommodate Greene's job. She begins an affair with a coworker, and the marriage soon ends, with Rachel and Jen leaving Chicago first for Milwaukee and later for St. Louis. In \\"Love's Labor Lost\\", Greene makes miscalculations in treating a pregnant woman that lead to her death in childbirth, and the after-effects of this case linger long into Season 2. Mark and Susan have their picture taken in a photo booth (1996). In \\"A Miracle Happens Here\\", a Christmas episode, Greene explains that he is the son of an agnostic Jew and a lapsed Catholic. He lights a Hanukkah candle for a Holocaust survivor.Season 2, Episode 10. Greene understands some Yiddish.The expression Loch in kop. Greene's career becomes more difficult as he needs to make decisions that periodically alienate his friends, such as selecting Dr. Kerry Weaver for Chief Resident over another applicant, which angers Susan Lewis because the other applicant is a good friend of hers and because she bristles under Kerry's demanding, sometimes harsh leadership style. Greene's friendship with Dr. Ross becomes strained as his administrative tasks often put him at odds with Doug's wild ways and he is disgusted by Doug's personal problems to the point where he briefly overrules and belittles Doug's abilities as a physician before reconciling with his friend. His love life takes a more drastic downward spin when his feelings for Dr. Lewis increase, but she leaves the hospital for a job in Phoenix, Arizona. He suffers emotionally again after he is savagely attacked in the ER men's room in the episode \\"Random Acts\\". The attack is initially believed to be a retaliatory act to avenge the death of a patient who may have been \\"mistreated\\" by Dr. Greene because of the patient's race. Later, though, it is strongly implied that his assailant was a psychotic individual who was randomly attacking doctors. It is not known who the assailant was or what the assailant's intentions were. Greene buys a gun and uses it to scare a crowd of punks on a train but tosses the gun in the river soon afterwards. He struggles through a large part of Season 4 but comes to terms with his attack in Season 5 when he helps Nigerian-born janitor Mobilage Ekabo reveal his memories of torture by talking about the attack with him, allowing him to obtain political asylum and avoid deportation. With the passing of Doug's father comes the re-entrance of Mark's parents. He and Doug travel to California to settle Doug's father's affairs (Doug's father and new wife were both killed in a car wreck) and take a side trip to visit Mark's parents, who live in another part of California. His relationship with his father David is still strained, and his mother suffers from a string of medical conditions associated with aging. Mark also finds out that his mother viewed his birth as a mistake, as she didn't know his father well and got married quickly when she got pregnant. Mark's distrust of the Navy puts him at odds with David when he and Mark fight over whether Ruth should be treated in a base hospital or a civilian hospital. Ruth eventually dies and Mark goes to her funeral, leaving him on edge when he clashes with Kerry Weaver over Robert Romano's successful drive for the chief of staff position. Greene's personal life after his marriage ends is tumultuous. He follows in Doug's playboy footsteps, having several flings and an affair with Nurse Chuny Marquez, and setting up three dates in one day. He has a brief relationship with a needy desk clerk, Cynthia Hooper (played by Mariska Hargitay in season 4). Hooper leaves him after she finds out Greene doesn't really love her. Greene eventually meets British surgeon, Elizabeth Corday. Corday is in Chicago on an exchange program, under the guidance of Dr. Romano. Romano's advances on Corday fail, as does her relationship with Peter Benton. Eventually, Greene and Elizabeth begin dating in Season 5, finally forming a stable and happy relationship. During Season 6, Greene discovers that his father is suffering from advanced lung cancer. After David realizes that he can no longer live alone, he moves to Chicago and stays with Mark. After an awkward first meeting, he warms up to Elizabeth very quickly. Father and son reach an emotional bonding that heals the difficult relationship from Mark's youth, and David eventually succumbs to his cancer. Mark and Elizabeth begin a more serious relationship and move in together. Greene later buys a house, and he and Elizabeth get married and have a daughter, Ella. Their happiness is threatened, though, when the abusive father of a patient goes on a killing rampage after losing his son to social workers. In a bid to get his son back, he kills and injures a number of people and attempts to go after Elizabeth and Ella. After being shot by an armed bystander, he is brought to the ER. During his treatment, Greene takes him aboard an elevator to go to an operating room. The patient goes into cardiac arrest when alone in the elevator with Greene, who withholds defibrillation and allows him to go into ventricular fibrillation and die. He later falsifies records to show that he did attempt to save the patient. Elizabeth suspects what Mark did but lets the matter drop. Later, Rachel appears in Chicago unannounced, citing arguments with her mother, and moves in with Mark and a very reluctant Elizabeth. She sneaks out of the house at night and uses drugs, which clouds her relationship with Elizabeth. Death While suturing a patient's wound, Greene loses control of his faculties and is temporarily unable to speak. After a CT scan and a biopsy, he is diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, that is thought to be inoperable. Embarrassed, Greene briefly tries to hide his condition, but his cover is blown when he has a seizure while arguing with Carter. With little time, Greene seeks a second opinion from an eminent New York City neurosurgeon, Dr. Burke. Greene is told that the tumor is near a critical section of his brain but hasn't \\"invaded\\" it yet and they can perform an operation on New Year's Eve 2000. Greene's surgery is performed by Burke and things appear to be positive, although it takes him a while to return to his old self. A year or so later, however, Greene finds out his tumor has returned, and Dr. Burke both confirms this and says he cannot operate again because the tumor regrowth is now in part of his brain where an operation would render Greene completely vegetative. While chemo treatment will only allow Greene to live for another 5‚Äì6 months, Burke points out: \\"You should have been dead a year ago, Mark. You got married, saw your daughter be born - I'd say that was time well spent.\\" At this point, Rachel has run away from Jenn in St. Louis and is staying with Mark and Elizabeth. Though she vehemently denies it, her recreational drug use becomes apparent when her baby sister Ella gets hold of some ecstasy in her backpack and nearly dies after ingesting it in the episode \\"Damage is Done\\". When Rachel shows up, Mark can barely control his anger at her, berating her for repeatedly lying to him and for putting Ella in danger. However, he sees her remorse and fear for Ella are genuine; knowing Elizabeth is angry enough for both of them, he hugs Rachel when she starts to cry. When Mark refuses to throw Rachel out of the house, Elizabeth says she won't return home with Ella as long as Rachel is there and leaves home with Ella and moves into a hotel. Unwilling to tell Elizabeth about his condition, Mark stays with Susan during the course of his chemotherapy and radiation treatments. Elizabeth later finds out the truth and wants to come home, but Mark tells her she shouldn't pretend to be his wife just because he's sick; however, she returns anyway and begins helping Mark as his terminal illness advances. Mark suffers more medical problems and his time in the ER comes to an end. Eventually, however, he resigns himself to his fate and decides to halt the debilitating chemo, deciding he would rather have three good final months than twice that suffering from his treatments. On his last day in the ER, he meets with the same older woman that viewers saw on the first episode of ER. She again has a hangnail, and complains about how painful it is. Greene tells her that he has an inoperable tumor, asks another doctor to treat her, and tells the patient not to return to the ER again. He leaves the ER, stops his chemotherapy treatments, tells John Carter that he will now \\"set the tone\\" and takes Rachel on a last-minute trip to Hawaii to rebuild his relationship with her and relive happier times. After several moves around the island and some conflict with a surly Rachel, Mark suffers from increased symptoms, including a seizure while walking with Rachel, prompting her to call Elizabeth, who comes to Hawaii with Ella. One night, Rachel comes to her father's room while he sleeps. Mark awakens and smiles at Rachel, telling her with slurred speech that he was just dreaming of her and how she used to love balloons. He tells her that he was trying to think of a piece of advice that every father should tell his daughter, and tells her to be generous with her time, her love, and her life. Rachel tells her father that she remembers a lullaby that Mark used to sing her when she was a baby and slips a pair of headphones on his head and plays Israel Kamakawiwo'ole's rendition of \\"Over The Rainbow\\" for him as he smiles and falls back asleep. While the song plays, he is seen walking through an empty ER. The next morning, Elizabeth discovers that he has died. In the episode \\"The Letter\\", Carter discovers two faxes that had arrived earlier, both sent by Elizabeth. He reads the first one to the staff. It is a letter that Greene had written about his sentiments about the Chicago County ER where he had worked for many years, and the staff he had worked with throughout the years. They begin happily discussing his letter until someone notices that Carter is holding the second fax, visibly upset. He informs them that the second is a brief letter written by Elizabeth, notifying them that Mark had died that morning around 6 A.M., \\"‚Ä¶ at sunrise, his favorite time of the day.\\" She explains that she sent the first letter to show the staff at the ER what he thought of them. As the staff responds sadly to this news, Frank asks if he should post the second fax on the staff bulletin board, and Carter tells him to post both of them. The letter and the news of his passing sends many of the ER's staff that day into emotional turmoil, with Kerry Weaver going from second-guessing Abby's posting of the letter (she quickly changes her mind and says it should stay up) to crying and stating her regrets to Sandy Lopez that she's lost a friend. This portion of the episode closely models the scene at the end of the film Mister Roberts, when Jack Lemmon's character, Ensign Pulver, reads two similar letters connected with the title character's death. It was also revealed in the episode by Susan Lewis that he died at the age of 38, making his birth year end 1963 or 1964. At the close of the episode, as the staff rush out to the ambulance bay to handle incoming casualties, the wind blowing through the open door tears one page of Greene's letter off the bulletin board. Greene's body is returned to Chicago, where he is buried. Many of his friends and colleagues come to the funeral: John Carter, Peter Benton, Kerry Weaver, Abby Lockhart, Luka Kovaƒç, Susan Lewis, Jing-Mei Chen, Robert Romano, Jerry Markovic, Lydia Wright, Frank Martin, Donald Anspaugh, William \\"Wild Willy\\" Swift (played by Michael Ironside in 1994), Haleh Adams, Michael Gallant, Cleo Finch, Jen, Rachel, Ella, and Elizabeth. After the funeral, Rachel asks Elizabeth if she can visit to see Ella; Elizabeth responds \\"Of course, she's your sister.\\" Rachel then suddenly asks the driver to pull over: she walks to a bunch of balloons attached to a fence, takes a purple one and slowly lets go of it, watching it rise toward the sky. Rachel goes back to living with her mother in St. Louis, but later returns to Chicago when the time comes to select a college, as well as asking a bemused Elizabeth to help her acquire effective birth control pills. In the April 2009 ER series finale, she returns to County General to interview for a spot as a med student, showing that she has become a responsible young woman and followed in Mark's footsteps. Epilogue Dr. Mark Greene was written out of the series because actor Anthony Edwards had decided that he wanted to move on to other opportunities. Greene was shown in an old Christmas photo in Season 10's \\"Freefall,\\" alongside Abby and Drs. Lewis, Carter, and Kovac. He also appears in photos included in the slideshow shown at Dr. Carter's farewell party in the Season 11 episode \\"The Show Must Go On\\". Greene was also heard in a voice-over telling Carter that he needed to \\"set the tone\\" in the ER (which, incidentally, was what Dr. Morgenstern told Dr. Greene in the pilot episode). In the Season 12 episode \\"Body and Soul,\\" he is mentioned during a flashback to 2002, when Dr. Pratt tells his patient, Nate Lennox (James Woods), that the reason the ER has few staff working is because they are at Greene's funeral. In Season 14's \\"Blackout,\\" Nurse Chuny Marquez says that she can't believe the ER is going to be led by Pratt and Morris and says how she remembers when Mark Greene and Doug Ross used to run the place. Nurse Sam Taggart then says, \\"Who?\\", since she started working in the ER long after they had left.  Return to the series  In 2008, ER producers announced that Edwards would reprise his role for the series' final season, with Dr. Greene appearing in flashbacks in the episode \\"Heal Thyself\\" shedding light on Dr. Catherine Banfield's (played by Angela Bassett) past. On November 13, 2008, over 6 years after his exit from the show, Anthony Edwards returned as Dr. Mark Greene. The flashback episode took place in 2002, just months before Greene's death and revealed an encounter he had with Catherine Banfield, 6 years before she began working in that same emergency room. He was treating Banfield's son Darryl who had a debilitating disease which turned out to be leukemia. The story appeared to take place at the point in Season 8 when Mark and Elizabeth were reconciling after she learned his tumor had recurred. Greene takes on the mysterious case to save the 5 year old. He has a run-in with Kerry Weaver and Robert Romano about putting this case ahead of his chemo treatment which took a toll on him throughout that day. Darryl dies in the ER but it was Greene's heroic actions that triggered Catherine in the present day to help save a young girl from drowning, and may have also inspired her to work full-time at County. During their encounter, Cate kept pressing Greene, who told her to stop being a doctor and to start being a mother. Cate gave the same advice to the young girl's mother. In the season 15 episode The Book of Abby, long-serving nurse Haleh Adams shows the departing Abby Lockhart a closet wall where all the past doctors and employees have put their locker name tags. Among them, the tag \\"Greene\\" can be seen.

Undammed along its entire length, the river is the fourth longest free-flowing river in the contiguous United States. There is extensive use of its waters for irrigation. Its course furnishes habitat for diverse species, including wild steelhead and Chinook salmon runs.\\"John Day Subbasin Plan\\", p. 31 However, the steelhead populations are under federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) protections, and the Chinook salmon have been proposed for such protection. The river was named for John Day, a member of the Pacific Fur Company's overland expedition to the mouth of the Columbia River that left Missouri in 1810. Day struggled through eastern Oregon during the winter of 1811‚Äì12. While descending the Columbia River in April 1812, he and Ramsay Crooks were robbed and stripped naked by Native Americans at the mouth of the river that now bears his name, forcing them to hike back to friendly Umatilla Indians under extreme conditions. The absence of dams on the river causes its flow to greatly fluctuate throughout the year depending on snowpack and rainfall within the watershed. The highest flow recorded at a gauge on the lower John Day was on January 2, 1997. The lowest flow was no flow at all, which occurred on September 2, 1966; from August 15 to September 16, 1973; and on nine days in August 1977. The average flow at the gauge is . Drainage basin Through its tributaries, the river drains much of the western side of the Blue Mountains, flowing across the sparsely populated arid part of the state east of the Cascade Range in a northwest zigzag, then entering the Columbia upstream from the Columbia River Gorge. It flows through exceptionally scenic canyons in its upper course, with several significant paleontological sites along its banks.\\"John Day Subbasin Plan\\", p. 201 Elevations within the watershed range from at the river's mouth to more than in the Strawberry Mountains. The main branch of the John Day River rises in the Strawberry Mountains in eastern Grant County. The North Fork heads on the western slope of the Elkhorn Mountains in northeastern Grant County. The Middle Fork rises near the crest of the Blue Mountains on the eastern edge of Grant County. The South Fork's source is in northern Harney County, about south of the Grant County line. The main, south and middle forks each have their heads in different parts of the Malheur National Forest, while the North Fork's source is located within in the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest. The main fork flows initially north, then west through the John Day Valley and through the cities of Prairie City, John Day and Mount Vernon. At Dayville, in western Grant County, it is joined from the south by the South Fork John Day River, then flows north through Picture Gorge and the Sheep Rock Unit of the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument. At Kimberly in northwestern Grant County, it is joined from the east by the North Fork John Day River (which had already joined with the Middle Fork John Day River above Monument, Grant County, Oregon). The river then flows west across Wheeler County. At the county line with Jefferson County it flows north, past the Clarno Unit of the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument. As it approaches the Columbia River in north- central Oregon it flows in an increasingly meandering course, forming the boundary between Sherman County to the west and Gilliam County to the east. The John Day River joins the Columbia from the southeast approximately northeast of Biggs. The mouth of the river is on the narrow Lake Umatilla reservoir, formed on the Columbia by the John Day Dam, approximately downstream from the mouth of the John Day. Recreation and ecosystem The John Day is navigable by rafts and other small river craft by boaters who obtain permits provided by the BLM. Its lower course is used for irrigation of cropland and ranching. In 1988, the United States Congress designated of the river from Service Creek to Tumwater Falls as Wild and Scenic for its recreational opportunities. The segment of the river is a popular destination for anadromous steelhead and warm water bass fishing, as well as whitewater rafting. In addition to wild spring chinook salmon and bass, the river furnishes habitat for Columbia River redband trout, bull trout, and westslope cutthroat trout.\\"John Day Subbasin Plan\\", p. 52 There are no hatchery salmon or steelhead released in the John Day River.

Herman missed the and seasons to serve in World War II, but returned to play in with the Dodgers and Boston Braves (after being traded mid-season). At 37, he was considered prime managerial material by the new owners of the Pittsburgh Pirates. On September 30, 1946, Herman was traded to Pittsburgh with three marginal players (outfielder Stan Wentzel, pitcher Elmer Singleton and infielder Whitey Wietelmann) for third baseman Bob Elliott and catcher Hank Camelli.

Then he moved to the American League (AL) as the third-base coach of the Boston Red Sox for five years (1960‚Äì64), before managing the Red Sox to lackluster records in and ; his 1965 Boston club lost 100 games. After his firing by the Red Sox in September 1966, he coached for the California Angels (1967) and San Diego Padres (1978‚Äì79) and served in player development roles with the Padres and Oakland Athletics. Herman finished his 1,922-game big-league career with a .304 batting average, 1,163 runs scored, 2,345 hits, 486 doubles, 82 triples, 47 home runs, 839 runs batted in, 737 bases on balls and 428 strikeouts. Defensively, he recorded an overall .968 fielding percentage. He won four NL pennants (in , , , and ) but no World Series championships as a player (although he was a coach on the 1955 World Series champion Brooklyn Dodgers). His record as a Major League manager was 189-274 (.408). Herman holds the NL records for most putouts in a season by a second baseman and led the league in putouts seven times. He also shares the Major League record for most hits on opening day, with five, set April 14, 1936. Later life Herman in 1978 Herman moved to Palm Beach Gardens, Florida in 1968.

This technique relies on the psychological phenomenon of reactance, in which a person has a negative emotional reaction to being persuaded, and thus chooses the option which is being advocated against.Reverse Psychology.

The one being manipulated is usually unaware of what is really going on. Among children Susan Fowler, an author writes \\"Beware that such strategies [of reverse psychology] can backfire. Children can sense manipulation a mile away.\\" She instead recommends leading by example. The psychology professor John Gottman advises against using reverse psychology on teens, with the presumption that they will rebel, stating that \\"such strategies are confusing, manipulative, dishonest, and they rarely work\\".John Gottman, The Heart of Parenting (London 1997) p. 21, p. 179 and p. 212 Reverse psychology is often used on children due to their high tendency to respond with reactance, a desire to restore threatened freedom of action. Some parents feel that the best strategy is sometimes \\"reverse psychology\\": telling children to stay in the house when you really want them to choose to go outside and play.Eliot R.

Adorno and Horkheimer Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer characterized the effect of the culture industry as \\"psychoanalysis in reverse\\". Their analysis began with the dialectic which operated in Germany when heirs of the Romantic movement became seekers of \\"Strength through Joy\\", only to have their movement co-opted by a combination of the mass media and National Socialism. A modern example begins with the \\"fitness and jogging\\" boom in the United States in the 1970s. The \\"running craze\\" at the Boston Marathon and in California, dialectically, was the thesis that one did not have to be \\"Rocky\\" in a sweaty gym to be physically fit, and that body acceptance was the key to effective aerobic training. The culture industry responded to the thesis with major advertising campaigns from Calvin Klein and others, using images featuring exceptionally toned models. People compared themselves to these models, which created a sense of competition, and many high school students avoid jogging because of the resultant body shame. The culture industry mass-produces standardized material. This would not be dangerous if the material was meaningless, but it frequently offers and reinforces ideals and norms representing implied criticism of those who fail to match up. Empirical studies show that mass culture products can lower confidence and self-esteem, and cause humiliation among men and women whose particular characteristics fall outside the normalised range for appearance, behaviour, religion, ethnicity etc. Similarly, advertising frequently seeks to create a need to buy by showing differences between actual and ideal situations. The intention is usually to induce dissatisfaction with the present situation and to induce expectations of satisfaction through the acquisition of products which will transform the actual reality into the idealized reality. Hence, if the peer group buys, all those who cannot afford the products will feel additional unhappiness and frustration until they eventually join the group. Thus, sometimes the process of advocacy for the one outcome intends to produce the opposite outcome as the motivation for purchase. However, more often than not, the cause and effect is unintended. Marxist logic applied to the culture industry indicates that it is, per se, a dialectic in which declining profit margins and increasing costs make investors anxious for \\"sure things\\". Repeating winning formulas and stereotyping create the lowest common denominator products with the lowest costs. But the less creative the input, the more likely it becomes that roles will be cast in ways which match, rather than challenge, common prejudices which can inadvertently (or quite deliberately) damage the esteem of those in the marginalized groups.Adorno, Theodor W.

Hooper batted left-handed and threw right-handed. Hooper was born in Bell Station, California, and he graduated from Saint Mary's College of California. He played for major league teams between 1909 and 1925, spending most of that time with the Boston Red Sox and finishing his career with the Chicago White Sox. Hooper was often known for his defensive skills, and he was among the league leaders in defensive categories such as putouts by a right fielder. During several seasons with Boston, he teamed up with Duffy Lewis and Tris Speaker to form the Golden Outfield, one of the best outfield trios in baseball history. Hooper is also one of only two members of four separate Red Sox World Series championship teams (1912, 1915, 1916, 1918). He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1971.  Early life  Hooper was born on August 24, 1887, in Bell Station, California.Zingg, p. 28. His family had migrated to California as many other families from the United States due to the California Gold Rush.Zingg, p. 13. His father, Joseph \\"Joe\\" Hooper, was born in Morrell, Prince Edward Island in Canada.Zingg, p. 14. Joe was the fourth child and second boy born to English-born William Hooper, Harry's grandfather, and his Portuguese wife Louisa. Harry was the youngest child in his family of four; he had a sister named Lulu and twin brothers named George and Charlie.Zingg, p. 29. Hooper's mother, Mary Katherine (Keller), was from Frankfurt, Germany.Ancestry of Harry Hooper (1887‚Äì1974) Hooper's two older brothers had been forced to quit school early to work on the family farm, but Hooper showed an affinity for school, especially in math. One of Hooper's teachers helped to convince his parents to allow Hooper to attend a high school in Oakland.Zingg, p. 38. After graduating from the high school affiliated with Saint Mary's College of California, Hooper graduated from college there with an engineering degree. At St. Mary's Hooper had demonstrated his skills both academically and on the ballfield.Zingg, p. 39 Baseball career Minor leagues Hooper was a pitcher when he signed with the Oakland Commuters in 1907 to begin his minor league career, but he converted to a position player role. In 41 games with Oakland, he hit for a .301 batting average in 156 at bats. He spent the next year with the Sacramento Senators, hitting .344 in 77 games. His contract with Sacramento also provided him with work as a railroad surveyor when he was not playing baseball. Hooper did not know it at first, but his manager in Sacramento, Charles Graham, was a scout for the Boston Red Sox. Graham helped to arrange a meeting between Hooper and Red Sox owner John I. Taylor. Hooper was signed to a $2,800 contract with Boston.Gay, p. 76. Boston Red Sox 1912 baseball card of Hooper Breaking into the majors with the Red Sox in 1909, Hooper played in 81 games and hit .282. Between 1910 and 1915, he teamed with Tris Speaker (CF) and Duffy Lewis (LF) to form the Golden Outfield, one of the finest outfield trios in baseball history. Religious differences may have been the biggest challenge for the Golden Outfield. At the time, a common Protestant sentiment was that Catholics would move to their communities and change the established culture. Speaker, who was a Protestant, once went a year without speaking to Hooper or Lewis, who were both Catholic. Though Hooper was a hard competitor on the field, he became known for his likable personality and sense of humor, which contrasted with Speaker's tough exterior.Gay, p. 77. Hooper became a favorite with the fans and he established a reputation as a clutch player. He became known as a top-caliber defensive right fielder and a solid leadoff hitter. He invented a maneuver known as the \\"rump-slide\\" for catching shallow fly balls. In 1910 Hooper played 155 games and hit .267 in a league-leading 688 plate appearances, marking the first of 11 consecutive seasons where he had at least 564 plate appearances. He led all AL outfielders with 30 assists that season, but he also committed a league- high 18 errors. In 130 games the next year, Hooper hit .311; the outfield trio of Hooper, Lewis and Speaker hit .315 combined. Hooper's batting average dropped to .242 in 1912. Boston won the 1912 World Series, during which Hooper made a catch that The Pittsburgh Press referred to as one of the finest plays in baseball history. The paper noted that Hooper \\"does not seek the limelight. He is reserved and bashful, and every action of his upon the baseball field plainly shows these qualities.\\" On May 30, 1913, Hooper became the first player to hit a home run to lead off both games of a doubleheader, a mark only matched by Rickey Henderson, Brady Anderson, and Ronald Acuna, Jr. over 80 years later. In 1914, he recorded 230 putouts in right field, which was the first of several seasons in which he finished in the top three in that category among right fielders. On October 13, 1915, in Game 5 of the 1915 World Series, he became the second player to hit two home runs in a single World Series game. Duffy contributed a third home run as the Red Sox won another world championship four games to one. Hooper was also the captain of the Red Sox in 1919.\\"Two Homers Hit Thrice\\". October 12, 1923. The New York Times. 12. Hooper became known for talking Boston manager Ed Barrow into converting Babe Ruth from a pitcher to an outfielder. Chicago White Sox Before the 1921 season, the media questioned whether Hooper would re-sign with the Red Sox for the coming season, saying that Hooper may have been disappointed not to be given an opportunity at manager. Since 1919, Red Sox owner Harry Frazee had been getting rid of expensive veteran players in what has been called a \\"fire-sale\\". Hooper was traded to the Chicago White Sox in March 1921 in exchange for Shano Collins and Nemo Leibold. Newspaper accounts said that Hooper had not been warned about the trade, that he would demand a higher salary from the White Sox and that he was prepared not to play unless the team met his demands. Hooper had some of his best offensive production with the White Sox. He hit over .300 in three out of the five seasons he spent with the team and he hit a career-high 11 home runs and 80 runs batted in during the 1922 season. In 1922 and again in 1924, Hooper was involved in eight double plays, which led the league for outfielders in both of those seasons. In 1925, Hooper asked for his release from Chicago so that he could pursue a position as a manager. Hooper was a career .281 hitter with 75 home runs, 817 RBI, 1429 runs, 2466 hits, 389 doubles, 160 triples, 375 stolen bases and 1136 bases on balls in 2309 games. Defensively, Hooper finished his career with a .966 fielding percentage playing at all three outfield positions. He holds the Red Sox franchise records for most triples (130) and stolen bases (300), as well as Fenway Park records for triples (63) and stolen bases (107). Hooper is only one of two players (Heinie Wagner being the other) to be a part of four Red Sox World Series championships. He hit better than .300 five times in his career and compiled a .293 batting average (27-for-92) in four World Series appearances. Outside baseball Early in his baseball career, Hooper became involved in business interests that were unrelated to baseball. His original interest was peach orchards in Capitola, California. He later purchased additional orchards in Yuba City, and he also began to produce artichokes and pomegranates. Hooper received a military draft exemption as a farmer in 1917, but his land was mostly maintained by his father or by foremen that he hired.Zingg, pp. 154-155. Given Hooper's hands-off approach to his business dealings, he relied heavily on the advice of others. Over the years, he entered into several business opportunities that lost money, including investments in an insurance agency, in oil drilling, and in juice processing. However, he was successful enough with local property investments that he avoided financial strain. Hooper married the former Esther Henchy in 1912 and they had three children, named John, Harry Jr, and Marie. His son John played minor league baseball under Lefty Gomez in Binghamton, New York. Later life Following his retirement from baseball, Hooper lived in Capitola and opened a real estate firm. He was named player-manager for San Francisco's minor league team in the Pacific Coast League in 1927. Hooper coached the baseball team at Princeton University for two seasons in the 1930s. He elected to leave the university when, in a cost-cutting measure prompted by the Great Depression, the administration proposed that his $5,000 annual salary be reduced by 40 percent.Zingg, p. 216. He was appointed postmaster in Capitola in 1933. He held that position for 24 years. He was active in civic affairs through the chamber of commerce and the improvement club. \\"He was one of Capitola's most prominent local citizens. Whenever something was going on in Capitola from the 1920s to the 1960s, he was involved,\\" local museum curator Frank Perry said. In 1939 he agreed to coach Boston's professional indoor baseball league team. He remained active in later life, enjoying hunting, fishing and following the San Francisco Giants and the Red Sox. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, John Hooper spearheaded a letter-writing campaign to get his father inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame via the Veterans Committee. Hooper was selected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1971. Hooper died at the age of 87 in Santa Cruz, California. He had been healthy enough to attend that summer's Baseball Hall of Fame induction ceremonies and he had gone duck hunting less than a month before he died. Hooper had surgery for a circulatory issue three weeks before his death, but he seemed to have recovered well from that procedure. Harry Hooper Jr said that Hooper had died of old age. He said that Hooper was the oldest living member of the Hall of Fame before his death. In popular culture Hooper Beach in Capitola is named for Harry Hooper. In 2014, the Capitola History Museum created an exhibit highlighting Hooper's importance in the development of the city. The television series The Simpsons made reference to Hooper in the episode \\"Homer at the Bat\\", where Mr. Burns has Hooper as playing center field for his company's all-star softball team. His assistant Smithers has to point out that all the players Mr. Burns had selected are long dead.

Alpenl√§ndische Dachsbracke) is a small breed of dog of the scent hound type originating in Austria. The Alpine Dachsbracke was bred to track wounded deer as well as boar, hare, and fox. It is highly efficient at following a trail even after it has gone cold. The Alpine Dachsbracke is very sturdy, and Austria is said to be the country of origin. Description Appearance This small dog has a slight resemblance to a Dachshund, with short legs (although longer than a dachshund's) and a long body. The coat is dense, short but smooth except for the tail and neck. The round eyes have a lively expression. Being very sturdy, the Alpine Dachsbracke is visibly robust and has a big boned structure. Preferred colors in competition are dark deer red with or without black hairs lightly interspersed. Black with red-brown markings on the head, chest, legs, feet, and tail are also permitted, as well as a white star on the chest (according to the American Rare Breed Association). The ideal height for dogs is 37‚Äì38 cm, and the ideal height for bitches is 36‚Äì37 cm. Strong limbs and feet, with black toenails and tight toes as well as strong elastic skin are features that judges look for in competition. They also look for a trotting gait. The top coat should be very thick, the undercoat dense and both closefitting to the body. The Alpine Dachsbracke weighs from 15 to 18 kg (33 to 40 lb) and stands from 34 to 42 cm (13 to 16 in) at the withers. It is often compared with the dachshund, as they are very similar in appearance. Temperament Used effectively to track wounded deer, this breed could work even in harsh terrain and high altitude. It makes a good companion, although it is primarily a hunter and therefore is kept mostly by hunters. It has a fearless, friendly and intelligent personality. Most Alpine Dachsbrackes are excellent with children and good with dogs and other pets, though they may exhibit a strong prey drive typical of many scent dogs. History Alpine Dachsbrackes, as with the other Bracke, can be dated back to the middle of the 19th century. The Dachsbrache were bred down in size by crossing the larger dogs with Dachshunds. It once was a favorite of German royalty. During the 1880s, Alpine Dachsbrackes accompanied Crown Prince Rudolf of Habsburg on hunting trips to Egypt and Turkey. The F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale recognizes the Alpine Dachsbracke in Group 6 Scenthounds, Section 2 ‚ÄúLeash Hounds‚Äù with the Bavarian Mountain Scenthound (Bayrischer Gebirgsschweisshund, no. 217) and the Hanoverian Scenthound (Hannover'scher Schweisshund, no. 213).F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale Group 6 The only major kennel club in the English- speaking world to recognise the Alpine Dachsbracke is the United Kennel Club (US) in their Scenthound Group, but they use the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale breed standard.

Its remarkable durability, high lifting power, and ability to take off and land from poor runways have given it a long service life. The An-2 was produced up to 2001 and remains in service with military and civilian operators around the world. The An-2 was designed as a utility aircraft for use in forestry and agriculture. However, the basic airframe is highly adaptable and numerous variants of the type have been developed; these include hopper-equipped versions for crop-dusting, scientific versions for atmospheric sampling, water-bombers for fighting forest-fires, flying ambulances, float-equipped seaplane versions and lightly armed combat versions for dropping paratroops.Harpole, Tom. \\"Antonovs in America\\" p2 p3 Air & Space/Smithsonian, August 2012.

Antonov designed a large single bay biplane of all-metal construction, with an enclosed cockpit and a cabin with seats for twelve passengers. The first prototype, designated SKh-1 and powered by a Shvetsov ASh-21 radial engine, flew on 31 August 1947. The second prototype was fitted with a more powerful Shvetsov ASh-62 engine, which allowed the aircraft's payload to be significantly increased from , and in this form it was ordered into production.Gunston 1995, p. 20. On the static display of \\"Oldtimer Fliegertreffen\\" Hahnweide 2011 Initial Soviet production was at State Factory 473 in Kiev, Ukrainian SSR, where the bulk of up to 5,000 units had been produced by 1960. Later Soviet production (after 1965, of model An-2M especially) was at State Factory 464 at Dolgoprudniy, Russian SFSR. After 1960, however, most An-2s were constructed at Poland's WSK factory in Mielec; it is believed that over 13,000 aircraft were built in Poland before principal manufacturing activity ended during 1991. However, up until 2001, limited production was undertaken using remaining stocks of components, spares and maintenance coverage, such as a small batch of four aircraft that were produced for Vietnam. Grzegorz Ho≈Çdanowicz: Polskie M28 uszczelniƒÖ Wietnam in: Raport-WTO nr.12/2003, p.23 China also builds the An-2 under licence as the Shijiazhuang Y-5. It has been occasionally and erroneously reported that there was East German production of the An-2, however, while An-2s often underwent extensive refurbishment in East German facilities, no new aircraft were constructed there. The An-2 is commonly used as a light utility transport, parachute drop aircraft, agricultural work and other tasks suited to a large slow biplane. Its slow flight and good short field performance make it suited for short, unimproved fields, and some specialized variants have also been built for cold weather and other extreme environments. The Guinness Book of World Records states that the 45-year production run for the An-2 was for a time the longest ever for any aircraft and challenged the well over two decades-long run of the much lighter, late-1920s origin Polikarpov Po-2 biplane it was intended to replace. But the An-2's production duration run record was exceeded by the four-turboprop, 1954-origin, Lockheed C-130 Hercules military transport. Further development Closeup of a private An-2TP During the early 1980s, Antonov experimented with a development of the An-2 powered by a modern turboprop engine. The unit used was a Glushenkov engine. Aircraft fitted with this engine had a longer, more streamlined nose to accommodate it. It received the designation of Antonov An-3. During 2013, Antonov announced that it had successfully flown for the first time a new version of the An-2, dubbed the An-2-100, which was fitted with a three-blade reversible propeller and a Motor Sich MS-14 turboprop running on kerosene rather than Avgas, which is no longer produced in CIS countries.Gethin, Howard. \\"Antonov flies turboprop-powered An-2-100.\\" Flight Global, 5 August 2013. That same year, the company stated that it had received orders for upgrading \\"hundreds\\" of the An-2 planes still in operation in Azerbaijan, Cuba and Russia to the An-2-100 upgrade version. The Siberian Research Institute of Aviation (SIBNIA) has test flown a highly modified Antonov An-2 with carbon fibre winglet-like braces and carbon fibre wing structures. It was equipped with a five-bladed turboprop engine, most probably the Honeywell TPE331 already installed on a modernized version of the An-2 that entered service in 2014. According to Russian aviation company Sukhoi, this aircraft was built to demonstrate the aerodynamic and structural changes that were planned for an eventual An-2 replacement announced on 10 June 2015. The autoclave-cured carbonfibre composite materials ‚Äì including wing panels, spars and ribs ‚Äì were produced by the Novosibirsk Aviation Plant. Sukhoi says the design change improved the speed of the An-2 by 50%, and testing also has shown the minimum flying speed of the aircraft is \\"close to zero\\".

The Antonov An-2 is a mass-produced single-engine biplane that has been commonly used as a utility and agricultural aircraft. It is deliberately furnished with a minimum of complex systems. The crucial wing leading edge slats that give the aircraft its slow flight ability are fully automatic, being held closed by the airflow over the wings. Once the airspeed drops below , the slats will extend because they are on elastic rubber springs. Under typical conditions, the take-off is complete within while the landing run requires ; these figures will vary dependent upon various factors, such as the aircraft's take- off/landing weight, the external air temperature, surface roughness, and headwind. The An-2 is equipped with various design features which make it suitable for operation in remote areas with unsurfaced airstrips. It is fitted with a pneumatic brake system (similar to those used on heavy road vehicles) to stop on short runways, along with an air line attached to the compressor, so the pressure in the tires and shock absorbers can be adjusted without the need for installing specialised equipment. The batteries, while sizable, are relatively easy to remove, so the aircraft does not need a ground power unit to supply power for starting the engine. Likewise, there is no need for an external fuel pump to refuel the aircraft as it is provided with an inbuilt onboard pump, which allows the tanks to be filled from simple fuel drums. Antonov An-2 (An2-TP) The An-2 has no stall speed, a fact which is quoted in the operating handbook. A note from the pilot's handbook reads: \\"If the engine quits in instrument conditions or at night, the pilot should pull the control column full aft and keep the wings level. The leading-edge slats will snap out at about and when the airplane slows to a forward speed of about , the airplane will sink at about a parachute descent rate until the aircraft hits the ground.\\" As such, pilots of the An-2 have stated that they are capable of flying the aircraft in full control at (as a contrast, a modern Cessna four- seater light aircraft has a stall speed of around ). This slow stall speed makes it possible for the aircraft to fly backwards relative to the ground: if the aircraft is pointed into a headwind of roughly , it will travel backwards at whilst under full control. The An-2's ability, looks and flying characteristics, and its status as one of the world's biggest single-engined production biplanes, mean that demand for the An-2 is increasing in Western Europe and the United States, where they are prized by collectors of classic aircraft, making it an increasingly common sight at airshows. Many western countries prohibit the use of the An-2 commercially because the aircraft has not been certified by the relevant national aviation authorities. These restrictions vary by country, but all prevent the An-2 being used for any 'for profit' purpose, with the exception of the United States, where An-2s imported since 1993 are limited to experimental certification, but PZL-built An-2s are exempt from this restriction due to a bilateral agreement with Poland. Operational history Military service Hryvna depicting the An-2 airplane An AN-2 of the Laos air force The An-2 was adopted in bulk by both the Soviet Air Force and other Eastern Bloc military forces. It was first used in a military context during the Korean War of the early 1950s. The Vietnam People's Air Force (VPAF) was another prolific user of the AN-2; during the Vietnam War, the service occasionally used the type as an attack aircraft. During the 1960s, a single An-2 that was attempting to engage South Vietnamese naval units was shot down by a United States Air Force McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II fighter, under the control of an Air Intercept Controller on the . On 12 January 1968, a clandestine TACAN site (call sign: Lima Site 85/Phou Pha Ti) installed by the United States Air Force in Northern Laos for directing USAF warplanes flying from Thailand to Vietnam was attacked by three North Vietnamese An-2s. A pair of An-2s fired on the outpost using a mixture of machine guns and rockets while a third An-2 orbited overhead to survey the assault. An Air America Bell UH-1B, XW-PHF that had been resupplying the site gave chase to the two attacking aircraft; using an AK-47, the American crew (Ted Moore Captain, Glen Wood Kicker) succeeded in shooting down one of the An-2s while the second aircraft was forced down by combined ground and air fire, eventually crashing into a mountain. The surviving Antonov returned to its home base, Gia Lam, near Hanoi. During the Croatian War of Independence in 1991, a number of aged An-2 biplanes previously used for crop-spraying were converted by the Croatian Air Force to drop makeshift barrel bombs; they were also used to conduct supply missions to the town of Vukovar and other besieged parts of Croatia.Mader 1996, p.145. The chief advantage for the An-2 was that they could take off and land in small or improvised airstrips; they were also frequently used to drop supplies by parachute on isolated garrisons. At least one AN-2 was shot down on 2 December 1991 over Vinkovci, eastern Slavonia, by a Serbian surface to air missile (SAM) emplacement which purportedly launched a salvo of SA-6s at the aircraft.Maga≈°, Branka and ≈Ωaniƒá, Ivo (2001). The war in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, 1991‚Äì1995. Taylor & Francis, p. 58. Following the shootdown, the flights over Serbian lines ceased, due to the presence of Serb SA-6's. The previous radar guided AA systems were avoided by keeping the airplane's speed below 140 km/h, the speed of objects that radars were programmed to erase from the screen. Reportedly, North Korea has operated a number of the AN-2s. The Korean People's Army Special Operation Force is known to use the An-2 to facilitate the infiltration of paratroopers.Bermudez, Joseph S. Jr., \\"North Korean Special Forces\\", Jane's Publishing Company, Surrey, United Kingdom, 1988. It has been speculated that in wartime, these aircraft could possibly be used to deliver troops behind enemy lines for sabotage operations. As October, 2020 during the ongoing 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict Azerbaijan Forces have been operating unmanned AN-2 for surveillance and bombing of Armenian defenses, however the type of the drone remaining unknown for Armenian sources. Armenian forces revealed footage of the alleged shotdown of Azerbaijani An-2, according to video evidence at least seven An-2 have been shotdown. https://www.urdupoint.com/en/world/nagorno-karabakh- republic-claims-downed-azerb-1042185.html  Civil aviation  Operation Barnstormer (May 2006). Over the years, dozens of nations and companies alike have employed the An-2 in civil roles. The type was heavily used throughout the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc nations; in particular, Russian airline Aeroflot has operated a large number of the An-2s. During the Soviet era, the An-2 was used as a short-range airliner in Estonia, performing regular flights between the towns of Kuressaare and K√§rdla, which reside on separate islands, Saaremaa and Hiiumaa. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the various communist states of Eastern European, most airlines in these regions have been withdrawing their An-2s from service. This is due to some of these aircraft being over 40 years old, as well as a result of the decline in the production of avgas to fuel the type. Private operators are typically still using the An-2s, as their stability, capacity and slow-flying ability has made them relatively popular for some functions, such as for skydiving. Whilst their relatively high noise levels, increasing maintenance costs, high fuel consumption and unsophisticated nature (the pre-flight checks alone take between 30 and 40 minutes) has rendered them obsolete for the majority of commercial routes in Europe, the large number of aircraft available means that unit prices are especially low in comparison to contemporaries (being available from as little as US$30,000 for a serviceable example). The price factor has made them highly attractive for continued use in the developing world, where their ability to carry large loads into short airstrips makes them assets to airlines on a budget. Many ex-Aeroflot An-2s have since found work with regional airliners across Africa, Central and South America, Cuba and southeast Asia. In recent years, the An-2 has also gained popularity in the U.S. and Canada, where it has often been used as a bushplane. Because of their reliability and robustness, several operators have continued to use the type to conduct scheduled passenger service between airstrips in Western countries; one example of such use being the air service between the North Sea islands of Sylt and F√∂hr. As of 2015, there were thousands of An-2s remaining in operation around the world, including over 1,500 in Russia, 294 in Kazakhstan and 54 in Ukraine. Variants An-2 variants Antonov An-2E WIG passenger cabin Soviet / Polish production * Izdeliye F ‚Äì The in-house designation for the An-2NAK observation aircraft which was later re-designated An-2K and/or An-2F.Gordon,Yefim & Komissarov, Dmitry. ‚ÄúAntonov An-2‚Äù. Midland. Hinkley. 2004. * Izdeliye K ‚Äì A prototype weather reconnaissance/research aircraft with an observers cockpit immediately forward of the fin above the rear fuselage. First flown on 21 March 1948 'Izdeliye K' was found to be under-powered and unable to carry out its intended mission at high altitude, the aircraft was abandoned after a landing accident in October 1948. The concept was resurrected in 1954 as the 'An-2ZA' / 'An-6 Meteo'. * Izdeliye T ‚Äì The original design concept originated at OKB-153 in Novosibirsk. * Izdeliye Sh ‚Äì The in-house designation for the 'Izdeliye T' (presumably to confuse spies or infiltrators) design project at Novosibirsk. * SKh-1 ‚Äì the original designation of the An-2 used during the design phase of the project before the OKB had been named after Antonov. * An-2A ‚Äì Developed from the An-2A for use as a Balloon interceptor to intercept reconnaissance balloons from, US intelligence assets, over-flying the USSR. The prototype was converted from a Kiev built An-2 (c/n 110347315) using the Turbo-charged Ash-62IR/TK of the 'An-6 Meteo' and a combined searchlight/gun turret mounted on top of the rear fuselage, which mounted either a single Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-23 23 mm calibre twin-barrelled cannon or a single Afanas'yev A-12.7 12.7 mm calibre heavy machine-gun. * An-2E (Ekranoplan ‚Äì wing in ground effect)The Antonov An-2E prototype ekranoplan (first use of the designation) ‚Äì One of a series of projects from the early 1970s for WIG (Wing In Ground effect) derivatives of the An-2, designed at the TsLST (Tsentral'naya Laboratoriya Spasatel'noy Techniki ‚Äì central laboratory for new types of rescue equipment). * An-2E (second use of the designation) ‚Äì An Ekranoplan conversion () of an An-2P (RA-84692). The fuselage was retained and a large trapezoidal monoplane wing having extended wingtips with approx 45¬∞ dihedral, attached to the lower wing attachment points. The prototype conversion was intended to be a floatplane; however, its first public appearance was as a landplane with the standard An-2 undercarriage. Jointly developed by the Moscow Aviation Institute, MARZ (Moskovskiy Aviaremontnyy Zavod ‚Äì Moscow Aircraft Overhaul Plant) and The TSZP-Saturn research institute the An-2E was also known as EA-00078. Power was supplied by the standard ASh-62IR radial engine with AV-2 propeller, but production versions were intended to be powered by automotive diesel engines of around . * An-2F ‚Äì Developed concurrently with the An-2 prototype, 'Izdeliye F' was an experimental artillery-observation aircraft with a twin- tail, ventral observer's position and dorsal defensive machine-gun position. The initial service designation of An-2NAK was changed to An-2F once post test flight modifications had been carried out. Two prototypes were built, with the first completed in the summer of 1948, but flight testing was delayed to April 1949 due to the need to incorporate modifications called up from the standard An-2 flight test programme. The flight test of the An-2F showed that the aircraft met all the requirements of the specification, but helicopters were demonstrating that they could perform the artillery correction role without the need to provide fixed base airstrip for them to operate from, thus the An-2F was not proceeded with and the two prototypes were retained by the Antonov bureau for hack duties with one later serving as a flying wind tunnel to investigate para-dropping from the Antonov An-8 twin-turboprop transport. * An-2F (second use of designation) ‚Äì A VTOL project with vertical thrust to be provided by a Mikulin AM-9 turbojet in the rear fuselage. * An-2F (third use of the designation) ‚Äì A proposed photo-mapping aircraft project, from the early 1990s, similar to the An-2PF equipped with one of five alternate cameras. Overall control was to have been by IBM 286 computer and the camera could be augmented or replaced by a thermal imaging system, Infra-Red imaging system, AP-6E autopilot, LDI-3 laser rangefinder and/or a GPS global positioning system. * An-2G (a.k.a. An-2Geo) ‚Äì During 1974 WSK-Mielec developed a geo-physical survey aircraft for the Polish State Geophysical Survey Agency (Pa≈Ñstwowe Przedsiƒôbiorstwo Poszukiwa≈Ñ Geofizycznych), with equipment for measuring magnetic fields, radiation and other instruments for prospecting. Adapted to fly in tropical latitudes at low altitude the 'An-2G' could fly for six hours and two were used for survey work in Nigeria in 1974. * An-2L (Lesozashchita ‚Äì forestry protection) ‚Äì A fire bomber variant with three cassettes each holding 120 ampoules, containing 1litre (34 fl.oz.) of fire-retardant which were dropped as required. Trials revealed that this system was inefficient and further work was abandoned. * An-2LL (Letayuschaya Laboratoriya ‚Äì flying laboratory) ‚Äì Any of a number of An-2s used as testbeds for various equipment. One An-2SKh (RA-70547), modified by the State Research Institute of Aircraft Systems. (GosNII AS ‚Äì Gosudarstvennyy Nauchno- Issledovatel'skiy Institut Aviatsionnykh Sistem), for environmental research, had a lateral observation blister which has often caused the aircraft to be misidentified as an An-2PF. * An-2LP (Lesopozharnyy ‚Äì forest firefighter) ‚Äì A single prototype converted from an An-2V floatplane, with 630 litre(139 Imp.Gal.) water tanks in each float for dropping on fires. The water tanks could be re-filled in flight, as the aircraft skimmed the surface of suitable bodies of water. Prior to dropping an alkaline wetting agent (NP-1 Sulphanol) was added to the water which was released through the scoops which also picked up the water to refill the tanks. Ten production aircraft were built seeing service in the Siberian and Far East regions of the USSR. * An-2LV (Lesnoj Vodnyj ‚Äì forest hydroplane) ‚Äì A firefighting waterbomber. * An-2M (Polish:[samolot] Morski ‚Äì seaplane) ‚Äì Polish production of the An-2V floatplane, designated An-2M, (not to be confused with the Soviet designation An-2M). Also known as the An-2W. * An-2M (Modifitsirovannyy ‚Äì modified) ‚Äì The designation An-2M was also used in the USSR for a much improved agricultural crop-sprayer/duster. The An-2M featured an all-duralumin welded and bonded fuselage, lockable tailwheel, enlarged fibre-glass hopper, Shvetsov ASh-62 radial engine with power take off to an auxiliary gearbox to drive the dusting/sprayignequipment, an angular fin of increased area and a hermetically sealed cockpit with no access to the cabin/hopper area. The hopper capacity was increased 42% to 2,000 litres (440 Imp.gal.) delivering product through an outlet enlarged to with dry product being fed to two dusting outlets at the tips of the lower wings. Due to lack of capacity at the Kiev factory and WSK- Mielec the An-2M was manufactured at DMZ N0.464 (Dolgoproodnyy Machinery Factory No.464) to the north of Moscow. * An-2P (Polish: Pasa≈ºerski ‚Äì passenger) (Russian: Passazhirskiy ‚Äì passenger) ‚Äì Soviet and Polish production of a standard passenger variant. Soviet production An-2P's had 10 permanently installed seats in a heated insulated cabin. Polish production aircraft had 12‚Äì14 seats, two jump seats for children and a baby cot. A total of 837 An-2P's were built. * An-2P (Protivopozharnij ‚Äì fire-fighting with water) ‚Äì A fire-fighting aircraft with a dumpable hopper filled with water and/or retardant. * An-2PD-5 (Polish: Pasa≈ºerski [samolot] Dyspozycyjny ‚Äì executive aircraft's) ‚Äì The production version of the 'An-2PD-6', featuring almost identical interior furnishings with a work table and reading light replacing one of the chairs. * An-2PD-6 (Polish: Pasa≈ºerski [samolot] Dyspozycyjny ‚Äì executive aircraft's) ‚Äì A prototype six seat VIP variant of the An-2P produced at WSK-Mielec in 1970, featuring a folding table, mini-bar, pantry and toilet. * An-2PF ‚Äì Soviet production An-2 aircraft configured for photo-mapping/survey tasks with camera hatches protected by sliding hatches on the undersurface of the fuselage. * An-2PF ‚Äì A joint request from the Polish State mapping Agency (Pa≈Ñstwowe Przedsiƒôbiorstwo Kartografii) led to Polish production of eight 'An-2PF' aircraft configured for photo-mapping/survey tasks with camera hatches protected by sliding hatches on the undersurface of the fuselage. * An-2PK ‚Äì A polar research aircraft developed by WSK-Mielec with heated skis, insulated cabin and an additional cabin heater. * An-2PRTV ‚Äì A single Polish production An-2, (SP-TVN, c/n1G 15944), modified as a television broadcast relay aircraft for the Polish Radio and Television Co. (Polskie Radio i Telewizja). * An-2R (Polish: Rolniczy ‚Äì agricultural) ‚Äì WSK-Mielec manufactured agricultural variant with tank for 1.300 kg of liquid or powdered chemicals. * An-2RA ‚Äì A projected up-graded Agricultural aircraft, based on the An-2R, developed at WSK-Mielec. * An-2RT (ReTranslyator ‚Äì relay installation) ‚Äì A single An-2 was converted to a telemetry relay station, for missile development work, relaying telemetry from test missiles to a ground station. * An-2TPS (Transportno-Passazhirskiy Sanitarnyy ‚Äì cargo/passenger medical) ‚Äì Polish production of ambulance aircraft derived from An-2TP aircraft with three stretchers each side and two medical attendants. * An-2S (Sanitarnyy ‚Äì medical) ‚Äì The An-2S was an adaptation of the standard An-2T cargo plane with up to six stretcher patients or three stretchers and six walking wounded along with attendants and support equipment. * An-2SKh (Sel'skoKhozyaistvennyy ‚Äì agricultural) ‚Äì The agricultural version optimised for crop-spraying and crop-dusting. A metal construction chemical hopper was installed in the cabin near the centre of gravity, feeding a spreader through a 300mm orifice. The original spreader was replaced in 1975 by a standardised RTSh-1 three channel spreader which increased distribution width from to . Liquid chemicals could be sprayed using an interchangeable system which delivered chemical to spraybars via a ram air turbine driven regulator pump to give coverage wide. Powdered or granulated chemicals were loaded through a hatch in the roof of the cabin and liquid chemical through a special connector on the port side of the fuselage. Early An-2SKh's were typically limited to a 6,000-hour life, as opposed to a normal life of 12,000 hours, due to the corrosive effects of the chemicals. The introduction of epoxy based corrosion protection systems partly alleviated the situation, allowing the agricultural An-2s to continue flying for much longer. Five An-2SKh aircraft were converted to firefighters, from 1954, by pressurising the hopper filled with water and/or retardant and ejecting it from a nozzle in place of the dusting/spraying equipment, single aircraft were allocated to Civil Air Directorates across the country but proved relatively ineffectual. * An-2T (Transportnyy ‚Äì cargo) ‚Äì The baseline first production model for cargo and mail carriage. * An-2TP (Transportno-Passazhirskiy ‚Äì cargo/passenger) ‚Äì A convertible passenger/cargo version, with tip-up seats for ten, released in 1949. * An-2TD (Transportno-Desantnyy ‚Äì cargo/paratrooper) ‚Äì paratrooper version with 12 seats, static line attachment cables and drop signalling lights. * An-2V (Vodnyy ‚Äì water-based) ‚Äì A seaplane version of the baseline An-2 fitted with twin floats supported on wire-braced struts at the undercarriage attachment points and rear fuselage. Floatplane An-2s manufactured in Kiev were designated An-4 but there is little evidence that this designation was widely used. At least one An-2V. AN-2V Video * An-2V (Vysotnyy ‚Äì high altitude) ‚Äì Six aircraft were built, at the Kiev factory, as weather reconnaissance An-2V's for use at high altitude. Powered by the ASh-62IR/TK turbo-charged engine, they differed from the 'An-6 Meteo' by not having the observers cockpit forward of the fin. * An-2VA ‚Äì water bomber. * An-2W (Wodnosamolot ‚Äì seaplane) ‚Äì Polish production of the An-2V, also sometimes designated An-2M (not to be confused with the improved variant). * An-2ZA (Zondirovaniye Atmosfery ‚Äì atmosphere sampling) ‚Äì The initial designation for a high altitude meteorological research re-designated as the 'An-6 Meteo'. * AN-2-100An-2-100 Modification of the design first flown in 2013 with a modern 3-bladed reversible propeller and a 1500shp Motor Sich MS-14 turboprop engine running on kerosene rather than Avgas. * An-3 (first use of the designation) ‚Äì A radical redesign of the An-2A to intercept reconnaissance balloons from US intelligence assets, over-flying the USSR. With a high aspect ratio monoplane high-set wing, turbo-charged ASh-62IR/TK and a combined searchlight/gun turret mounted on top of the rear fuselage. * An-3 (second use of designation) ‚Äì In an effort to replace the An-2SKh, after the poor performance of the abortive WSK-Mielec M-15 Belphegor, it was proposed to fit a turboprop engine on an all new fuselage featuring a hunchback for the cockpit and An-2M tail surfaces. This design was not carried through and a less ambitious re-design resulted in the third and final use of the An-3 designation. * An-3 (third use of designation) ‚Äì The prototype An-3 with a Glushenkov TVD-20 (1,054 kW/1,432 shp) turboprop engine, sealed cockpit with separate entrance door above lower wing leading edge and air conditioning to improve the cockpit environment. Two prototypes were built (CCCP-06131 and CCCP37901) with a third registration (CCCP26700) which is believed to be a re- registration of one of the other two registrations. The flight tests and trial s progressed well and the two prototypes set no less than six World Records for payload to altitude in their class. Due to the collapse of the USSR initial plans for production and variants were shelved until 1993 when production of converted aircraft began, as the An-3T, at the Omsk 'Polyot' factory. ** An-3T ‚Äì Due to the large number of surplus An-2s available the An-3T was not produced from scratch but by converting aircraft which had at least 50% of their life remaining. All the aircraft were re-registered and given new construction numbers. ** An-3TK ‚Äì A convertible passenger /cargo version with six foldable twin seats. ** An-3SKh ‚Äì An agricultural version tested with one of the original prototypes but with no known production conversions. ** An-3P ‚Äì A forest fire fighting water bomber with a tank installed in the fuselage. ** An-3S ‚Äì A projected ambulance version with six stretchers and two medical attendants. ** An-3D ‚Äì Projected military troopship version with tip-up seats for paratroopers. * An-4 ‚Äì This designation was used for An-2V seaplanes produced at Kiev, but does not seem to be used much. This is either due to very limited production at Kiev or operators not making the distinction between the An-2V and An-4. * An-6 ‚Äì A transport aircraft fitted with the Shvetsov Ash-62IR/TK turbo-charged engine was produced for use in mountainous areas at high altitudes. An unknown number were delivered to the Tajik Civil Aviation Directorate and the Polar directorate for use in the far north of the USSR and to support the USSR's Antarctic research stations.An-6 Meteo *An-6 Meteo ‚Äì After the failure of 'Izdeliye K', the Antonov bureau was tasked with developing the 'An-2ZA' high-altitude weather reconnaissance aircraft based on the An-2. Featuring the same observers cockpit, forward of the vertical stabiliser above the rear fuselage, used on 'Izdeliye K', power was supplied by a turbo-charged Shvetsov Ash-62IR/TK which enabled the 'An-2ZA' to carry out its intended high-altitude research role. On 9 June 1954 OKB-153 test pilot V.A. Kalinin and Flight Engineer V.I. Baklaykin set a World altitude record for Class C-1e-1 () at which had not been broken by 2004. The 'An-2ZA' was re-designated 'An-6 Meteo' early in its career and continued to fly until a take-off accident in September 1958 caused extensive damage. * Grach-2 (Grach-Rook) ‚Äì Students from the SKB MAI (Studencheskoye Konstruktorskoye Byuro Moskovskii Aviatsionii Institut [Sergo Ordjonikidze] ‚Äì student construction bureau Moscow Aviation Institute [Sergo Ordjonikidze]) studied agricultural aircraft utilising the WIG effect. Their first effort, named Grach-2, was a standard An-2 fuselage mated to low-set inverted gull. reverse-delta monoplane wings with couter, constant chord, dihedral sections and fitted with a t-tail. * Grach-3 ‚Äì The second projected WIG agricultural aircraft from the SKB MAI was the Grach-3. This aircraft was to have been similar to the Grach-2 but utilising a centre section with near constant chord which allowed the tailplane to be dispensed with and pitch controlled by elevators at the rear of the centre section. * Lala-1 ‚Äì A research prototype with an open-frame rear fuselage, twin tail and twin tailwheels supported by struts under the rear of the fuselage pod. An Ivchenko AI-25 turbofan engine was fitted in the rear of the fuselage pod for use as a development model for the WSK-Mielec M-15 Belphegor agricultural aircraft. * SibNIA TVS-2MS ‚Äì Turboprop conversion of An-2 by Siberian Aeronautical Research Institute (SibNIA) using Honeywell TPE331-12UHR engine. First flown 5 September 2011. Deliveries to the Aerial Forest Protection Service began in 2014, with six flying by August 2014 and 16 in service by early 2017. * SibNIA TVS-2-DT - Fitted with new composite wings (with no bracing struts or wires) and tail. First flight 10 June 2015. * SibNIA TVS-2-DTS - TVS-2-DT fitted with new all- composite fuselage.

Operators Specifications (An-2) Antonov An-2 Accidents and incidents As of 19 December 2017 there have been 622 An-2 hull-loss accidents, claiming a total of 774 lives. One of the most recent accidents occurred around 15:00 on 2 July 2017 in the Black Sea, when an Antonov An-2R operated by Albatros crashed in the Kiliya District, Ukraine during an aerial application flight; both pilots survived. In the first known post-WWII act of suicide by pilot, on September 26, 1976, Russian national Vladimir Serkov made an unauthorized takeoff with an Antonov An-2 (Reg # USSR-79868) from Novosibirsk-Severny Airport and crashed the aircraft into the stairwell of an apartment complex at Stepnaya st., house 43 / 1, where his ex- wife's parents lived, in an attempt to kill his ex-wife. After completing two laps around the scene, Serkov attempted to pilot the plane to the parents' apartment where his wife and two-years-old son were visiting. The aircraft pierced the stairwell between the 3rd and 4th floors, and being fueled with 800 liters of gasoline, ignited a large fire inside the stairwell that ultimately spread to damage 30 total apartments. Firefighters were on scene in five minutes, taking 57 minutes to extinguish the blaze. A four-year-old and two six-year-old children were killed at the scene from burns sustained. Another four-year-old child died eight days later as a result of burns sustained. In total, 11 residents were injured as a result of fire burns. Serkov's ex-wife (and her parents) and his toddler son were not injured in the incident. See also References Citations Bibliography * Gunston, Bill.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed June 8, 2011 in southern Manitoba in Canada and northeastern North Dakota in the United States. It drains an area (about 8500 square kilometers) of the prairie country along the Canada‚ÄìUS border, threading the Manitoba-North Dakota border eastward to the Red River. Via the Red River, Lake Winnipeg and the Nelson River, it is part of the watershed of Hudson Bay. It rises in several streams on the eastern side of the Turtle Mountains on both sides of the international border. The streams converge near Neelin, Manitoba and flow initially northeast, then southeast along the west side of the Pembina Hills into Cavalier County in northeastern North Dakota. It flows east, just south of the border, past Walhalla and Neche. It joins the Red River from the west just south of Pembina, approximately south of the international border. It receives the Tongue River from the south approximately upstream from its mouth on the Red. The main tributaries of the Pembina River are Badger Creek and Long River. Some of the numerous minor tributaries include the Mary Jane, Pilot, Crystal, and Snowflake Creeks. The Pembina River ranges in depth from at mid-channel. The full width of the river is highly variable, ranging from to as much as in other areas.Fisheries Enhancement Evaluation for the Pembina River. 1997. MES Environmental There are numerous wetlands and prairie potholes in this watershed. The elevation of the watershed ranges from above sea level in the southwestern corner of the watershed, down to adjacent to the Pembina River in the southeastern corner of the watershed. The watershed is level through the central and eastern regions, however the elevation rises roughly in the radius around the Turtle Mountain Provincial Park. Water flow rates in the Pembina River watershed are highly variable. Data from hydrometric stations are used to monitor river flow rates and lake levels, for flood forecasting, and water management investigations. Water levels typically peak during spring run-off and rapidly declines generally in a few days. Groundwater contribution to stream flow normally ensures the river runs throughout the year. The months of March, April and May account for 68 percent of the run-off in a given year. Annual spring run-off rates are highly variable. In Neche, ND the lowest annual volume recorded was 356-m (2870 acre-ft) in 1939. The highest recorded volume was 94,400 hectare-m (765,000 acre-ft) in 1997.Pembina River Basin Watershed Management Plan 2005 flow volumes for Pembina River at Neche Environment Canada has a water quality monitoring station is maintained at the south-east corner of the watershed, near the International Boundary. Information from this station is collected regularly and is used to analyze for numerous variables including pesticides, metals, nutrients, general chemistry, and bacteria. A study conducted in 2001 Jones, G., N. Armstrong. 2001. Long-term trends in total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations in Manitoba streams. Manitoba Conservation Report No. 2001-07. 154 pp. found that over a 25-year period (1974‚Äì99) phosphorus concentrations had increased by 52 percent in the Pembina river. This increase in phosphorus is likely a result of increased nutrient input from a combination of wastewater treatment, agricultural inputs, and atmospheric depositions. Elevated phosphorus concentrations promote excessive algal bloom growth, which have many undesirable outcomes for the watershed and the entire Lake Winnipeg basin.

He has served as president of the West Coast branch of PEN, and as a member of the Board of Directors of the Writers Guild of America; he was also on the faculty of the American Film Institute and the Sundance Institute.About-us, Pajamas Media, accessed January 7, 2009. His many journalistic articles have appeared in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Los Angeles Times, Commentary, Real Clear Politics and City Journal, among others. Simon has also been a Hoover Institute Media Fellow. Simon's most recent work - The GOAT - was published September 2019. A Faust-like story set in the world of professional tennis, it was described as his best novel by The New Criterion. As of December 1, 2019, Mr. Simon has moved his journalism exclusively to The Epoch Times as their Senior Political Analyst. PJ Media Simon served as CEO of PJ Media until 2013 and is currently its CEO Emeritus. PJ Media is a media company and operator of an eponymous conservative opinion and commentary website. Founded in 2004 by a network primarily, but not exclusively, made up of conservatives and libertarians led by Simon, it was originally intended as a forum \\"with the intention of... aggregating blogs to increase corporate advertising and creating our own professional news service\\" but now includes an online television service, PJTV, as well.. PJ Media's name, formerly Pajamas Media, is derived from a dismissive comment made by former news executive vice- president Jonathan Klein of CBS during the Killian documents affair involving then-CBS anchorman Dan Rather in the fall of 2004: \\"You couldn't have a starker contrast between the multiple layers of checks and balances at 60 Minutes and a guy sitting in his living room in his pajamas\\".. PJ Media was sold to Salem Communications in March 2019. Simon continues his affiliation with the company as co-founder and CEO Emeritus. Books Moses Wine Series =The Big Fix= Roger L. Simon began to develop the idea for Moses Wine when Alan Rinzler, who was working as an editor at Straight Arrow Books, a venture by Rolling Stone, suggested that a book Simon had written about a veteran of the Bay of Pigs Invasion who goes crazy and kidnaps the son of a radical lawyer, had poor commercial prospects. Rinzler suggested that Simon do something \\"more Rolling Stone.\\" In response, Simon, who had recently been exploring the works of Raymond Chandler and Ross Macdonald came up with the idea of updating the private-eye genre with a \\"hip, \\"political,\\" and edgy \\"longhair.\\" Six weeks later, Simon had finished the first Moses Wine novel, \\"The Big Fix.\\" At the time, Simon was living in Echo Park, California, where many of the stories in the Moses Wine series take place. Moses Wine was different from other fictional detectives that Simon saw as devoid of ethnicity, family, friends, or interests outside of work. In Moses Wine, Simon created a character that was proudly Jewish, divorced, and given to smoking marijuana. The cases taken on by Moses Wine were also unconventional. \\"The Big Fix\\" focused on the case of an Abbie Hoffman-like radical prankster who attempts to derail the presidential candidacy of a liberal democrat. \\"The Big Fix\\" won several awards and became a best-seller. It was later turned into a popular movie starring Richard Dreyfuss in 1978 for which Simon wrote the screenplay. =Raising the Dead= In \\"Raising the Dead,\\" Wine is retained by an Arab organization to prove that it had nothing to do with a terrorist attack. Most of the story takes place in Israel and Los Angeles, where a young member of a militant Jewish group has gone underground. Responding to speculation that he had uncovered information related to the killing of Alex Odeh, a regional director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination League who had spoken out regarding the takeover of an Italian cruise-ship by Palestinians, Simon said that while he had visited Israel twice and talked to Jews and Arabs in the West Bank, he had not made any inquiries about the case. Simon said, \\"This is not fact, this is fiction. If I had accidentally uncovered any information, I would have gone right to the FBI. It's a capital case.\\" =California Roll= At the start of California Roll Wine is feeling his age and recovering from a mid-life crisis when he is invited to Silicon Valley by Alex Wiznitsky, a young genius known as the Wiz, who wants him to become head of security for Tulip, a computer company that rose from backstreet obscurity into the Fortune 500 in only three years. Soon after, one of the Wiz's collaborators, another genius known as the Last Nerd, has disappeared. Wine eventually follows the case to Japan where roughly half the story takes place. The Straight Man In \\"The Straight Man\\" Wine has quit his posh job in corporate security and is back in West Los Angeles where he is half-heartedly doing private detective work from his apartment while trying to cure his mental angst with regular visits to a psychiatrist. This psychiatrist, himself disabled and using a wheelchair, asks Wine to investigate a possible murder. The dead man, Mike Ptak, was the husband of a patient being treated by the psychiatrist. =Moses Wine as autobiography= Simon says that the books are partially autobiographical. He said, \\"the series reflects where I was and where I am. It's my diary. I have to have some new thing happening in my life that engages me. I wrap a mystery around that. That's why there aren't more books. I've always been told that I should be doing one every year-and-a-half. I can't. I can't treat it like a television series, every week a new mystery.\\"Dick Lochte, \\"The second coming of Moses Wine; Roger L Simon‚Äôs semiautobiographical novels about the edgy, radical sleuth are being reissued.\\" Los Angeles Times, May 22, 2000 =Non-Fiction Books= =Turning Right at Hollywood and Vine: The Perils of Coming Out Conservative in Tinseltown= First published as \\"Blacklisting Myself,\\" this short memoir was Simon's first book-length work of non-fiction. It describes his gradual political turn from left to right as well as many personal adventures in movie business working with such well known figures as Richard Dreyfuss, Richard Pryor, Woody Allen and Paul Mazursky. =I Know Best: How Moral Narcissism Is Destroying Our Republic, If It Hasn't Already= An outgrowth of Simon's political writing, this book explains how moral narcissism is a threat to our republic. Unlike the conventional narcissism of a Greek youth transfixed by his handsome reflection in a pool, this is a narcissism of ideology. What you proclaim are your ideas and values, Simon warns, not their results are what makes you \\"good.\\" The first chapter of this book was reprinted in Commentary magazine. Screenplays Besides \\"The Big Fix\\", among Simon's other screenwriting credits are Bustin' Loose, with Richard Pryor, Enemies, A Love Story with Anjelica Huston and Ron Silver, My Man Adam which Simon also directed, and Scenes from a Mall, with Woody Allen and Bette Midler. Simon also received story credit on A Better Life, a movie about an undocumented immigrant working as a gardener in Los Angeles while struggling to keep his son away from gangs. The film was directed by Chris Weitz; lead actor Demi√°n Bichir was nominated for a 2012 \\"Best Actor\\" Academy Award. Awards Simon was nominated for an Academy Award for co-writing the screenplay of the 1989 film Enemies, a Love Story based on the novel by Nobel Prize winner Isaac Bashevis Singer. The Moses Wine novels have been nominated for the Edgar Awards from the Mystery Writers of America. The Big Fix received the John Creasey Award for best first crime novel from the Crime Writers of Great Britain. Political views Simon remained conventionally liberal until the 1990s when he began asking questions in response to events such as the O.J. Simpson murder trial. Simon, a former civil rights activist in the 1960s, said he was shocked by \\"the kind of essential dishonesty to justice\\" of Simpson's acquittal. Simon said, \\"I found the use of racial politics in the O.J. trial so repellent to me, morally, but also, I couldn't believe it was happening right there in front of my eyes. It started to shake up some things. And then came 9/11.\\" Simon experienced a political transformation in which he felt alienated from what he saw as the excesses of the Left after the realities of the September 11 attacks affected him. He jokes, \\"I may be the first American writer who was profiled both by Mother Jones and National Review.\\" He supports same-sex marriage and the War on Terror, and contends that those issues are linked. He also edits a weblog. In 2005 he founded, with jazz guitarist Charles Johnson, webmaster of the Little Green Footballs weblog, a startup company called Pajamas Media. Pajamas Media, now known as PJ Media, expanded in 2008 into Internet television with Pajamas TV, now known as PJTV. Simon, with screenwriter Lionel Chetwynd, hosts PJTV's \\"Poliwood\\" show, covering the intersection of politics and Hollywood. Simon's first non-fiction book, Blacklisting Myself: Memoir of a Hollywood Apostate in the Age of Terror, was published by Encounter Books in February 2009. It was republished in 2011 with additional material under the title Turning Right at Hollywood and Vine: The Perils of Coming Out Conservative in Tinseltown In May 2015, Simon began writing the Diary of a Mad Voter blog for PJ Media to cover the presidential election of 2016, interviewing major candidates in print and video. Simon's recent book -I Know Best: How Moral Narcissism Is Destroying Our Republic, If It hasn't Already - was published by Encounter Books in June 2016. Education and personal life Born to a Jewish family in New York City, New York, on November 22, 1943, Simon is a graduate of Dartmouth College and the Yale School of Drama. He has been married three times. He is currently married to Sheryl Longin, who wrote the screenplay for Dick, a film spoof of events in the Watergate political scandal. In 1997 Simon directed the feature film Prague Duet based on a script he wrote with Longin. They currently live in Nashville, TN with their daughter.

Huggins played second base for the Cincinnati Reds (1904‚Äì1909) and St. Louis Cardinals (1910‚Äì1916). He managed the Cardinals (1913‚Äì1917) and New York Yankees (1918‚Äì1929), including the Murderers' Row teams of the 1920s that won six American League (AL) pennants and three World Series championships. Huggins was born in Cincinnati. He received a degree in law from the University of Cincinnati, where he was also captain on the baseball team. Rather than serve as a lawyer, Huggins chose to pursue a professional baseball career. He played semi-professional and minor league baseball from 1898 through 1903, at which time he signed with the Reds. As a player, Huggins was adept at getting on base. He was also an excellent fielding second baseman, earning the nicknames \\"Rabbit\\", \\"Little Everywhere\\", and \\"Mighty Mite\\" for his defensive prowess and was later considered an intelligent manager who understood the fundamentals of the game. Despite fielding successful teams for the Yankees in the 1920s, he continued to make personnel changes in order to maintain his teams' superiority in the AL. He was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1964. Early life Huggins was born on April 19, 1879, in Cincinnati, where his father, an Englishman, worked as a grocer. His mother was a native of Cincinnati. He had two brothers and one sister. Huggins attended Woodward High School, Walnut Hills High School, and later the University of Cincinnati, where he studied law and played college baseball for the Cincinnati Bearcats baseball team. A shortstop, he was named team captain of the Bearcats in 1900. Seeing him consumed with baseball, his law professors summoned him to justify why they should keep him in the law program. Huggins' father, a devout Methodist, objected to his son playing baseball on Sundays. But Huggins played semi-professional baseball in 1898 for the Cincinnati Shamrocks, a team organized by Julius Fleischmann, where he played under the pseudonym \\"Proctor\\" due to his father's opposition and his amateur status. In 1900, he played for Fleischmann's semiprofessional team based in the Catskill Mountains, the Mountain Tourists, leading the team with a .400 batting average. After receiving his law degree from Cincinnati, Huggins realized that he could make even more money playing baseball, and as such William Howard Taft, one of Huggins' law professors, advised him to play baseball. He was admitted to the bar, but never practiced law. Professional career Early playing career (1899‚Äì1903) Huggins began his playing career in minor league baseball with the Mansfield Haymakers of the Class B Interstate League in 1899. He continued his minor league apprenticeship with the St. Paul Saints of the American Association from 1901 through 1903. After starting his career as an exclusively right-handed hitter, he began to bat from the left side in 1902 in response to his offensive struggles in the 1901 season while also moving to second base during his time at St. Paul. Miller Huggins' 1909 baseball card Huggins handled 19 fielding chances, 11 putouts and nine assists, without committing an error in a game with the Saints in 1902; the previous Major League Baseball (MLB) record being 18, set by Fred Dunlap in 1882. In 1903, he pulled off the first delayed steal in recorded baseball history. Cincinnati Reds (1904‚Äì1909) Fleischmann, part-owner of the Cincinnati Reds of the National League (NL), kept an eye on Huggins while he played for St. Paul. The Reds duly purchased his contract from the Saints before the 1904 season. He made his MLB debut on April 15, 1904, and proved very adept at getting on base. He batted .264 with the Reds that season and improved in the 1906 season, finishing with a .292 batting average and 41 stolen bases, while spending considerable time developing his upper-body strength. Although Huggins hoped to be selected as Ned Hanlon's successor as Cincinnati's manager after the 1907 season, the Reds instead went with John Ganzel. In 1908, he played with the Reds in the Cuban-American Major League Clubs Series. Hampered by a broken ankle and torn ligaments in his shoulder, he slumped to .209 in 1909. St. Louis Cardinals (1910‚Äì1917) Before the 1910 season, the Reds traded Huggins, along with Frank Corridon and Rebel Oakes, to the St. Louis Cardinals in return for Fred Beebe and Alan Storke. He set an MLB record on June 1, 1910 with six plate appearances but no at bats, with four walks and two sacrifice flies. In the same year, he batted .265 for the Cardinals and led the NL in walks. Huggins with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1912 On July 13, 1911, he tied the NL record for successful fielding chances in a game with 16. At the end of the season, he finished sixth in the voting for the Chalmers Award for Most Valuable Player. In 1912, he hit over .300 for the first time in his career. Huggins became player-manager for the Cardinals after the 1912 season, succeeding Roger Bresnahan, with team owner Helene Hathaway Britton preferring his \\"gentlemanly\\" manner over Bresnahan's rougher personality.Koppett, p. 84 With the acquisition of speed in a trade with the Pittsburgh Pirates, including Dots Miller, Art Butler, Cozy Dolan and Chief Wilson, the Cardinals contended for the NL pennant in 1914. Finishing in third place, it was the Cardinals' best finish since 1876, but they fell back to sixth in 1915 and last in 1916. When Britton sold the team after that season, she offered Huggins a chance to buy a part of the team. While he was attempting to raise money from the Fleischmann family, Britton sold the team to a group headed by Samuel Breadon, who hired Branch Rickey to run the team's day-to-day operations in the front office. Huggins had coached the young Rogers Hornsby, helping him to correct his batting stance, and Hornsby duly succeeded him as the team's starting second baseman in 1917 as Huggins ended his playing career. He managed the team during 1917, the last year of his contract, but was not retained. New York Yankees (1918‚Äì1929) With the New York Yankees of the American League (AL) not performing well, Yankees owners Jacob Ruppert and Tillinghast L'Hommedieu Huston sought to replace \\"Wild\\" Bill Donovan as manager. Ban Johnson, AL president, suggested Huggins to Ruppert as a replacement for Donovan. Huston, who had been in Europe at the time that Ruppert had made the appointment, disliked Huggins and wanted to hire Wilbert Robinson, his drinking buddy.Smelser, p. 194 Ruppert himself had been put off by Huggins' wool cap and practice of smoking pipes in public, which he felt was the mark of the working class. However, Ruppert interviewed Huggins upon Johnson's recommendation, and agreed that Huggins knew much about baseball. Ruppert offered the job to Huggins, who initially did not want to take the position, as the Yankees were in no better a position than the Cardinals. J. G. Taylor Spink of The Sporting News eventually convinced Huggins to accept the offer, and he signed a two-year contract. The hiring of Huggins drove a wedge between the two co-owners that culminated in Huston selling his shares of the team to Ruppert in 1922.Koppett, p. 85 Having taken charge Huggins did not shy away from making personnel changes. Upon taking over the Yankees, he stressed fundamental baseball, drilling the Yankees in the art of the bunt. Huggins also made his first player transaction, acquiring Del Pratt and Eddie Plank from the St. Louis Browns trading Nick Cullop, Joe Gedeon, Fritz Maisel, Les Nunamaker, Urban Shocker and $15,000 ($ in current dollar terms), a move that led to criticism in the press. In Huggins' first season with the Yankees, the team finished fourth in the AL. After that season, he obtained Ernie Shore, Dutch Leonard and Duffy Lewis from the Boston Red Sox, for Ray Caldwell, Frank Gilhooley, Slim Love, and Roxy Walters. The following year he traded Pratt, Muddy Ruel, Hank Thormahlen and Sammy Vick to the Red Sox for Waite Hoyt, Harry Harper, Mike McNally and Wally Schang. Huggins signed a one-year contract to remain with the Yankees for a reported $12,000. Huston continually took the side of his players in any argument they had against Huggins, criticizing Huggins in the press when the Yankees lost the pennant in 1920. Meanwhile, Ruppert was at best a lukewarm advocate of Huggins. Babe Ruth resisted Huggins' discipline; he did not respect Huggins due to his small stature, soft-spoken nature, and inability to fight, and Huggins was unable to enforce punishments on Ruth, despite being well educated. The Yankees finished third in the AL in 1919 and 1920. Huggins signed a one-year contract to remain with the team in 1921. Huggins with the Yankees in 1922 Coming into the 1921 season, Huggins was still experiencing criticism in the press. Hugh Fullerton wrote that \\"in the past Huggins has not shone as a leader of men\\".Smelser, p. 196 By that season, Huggins developed Aaron Ward, Wally Pipp, and Bob Shawkey. The Yankees won their first AL pennant in 1921, reaching the World Series for the first time in franchise history, silencing his critics in the press. However, they lost the 1921 World Series to the New York Giants. In response, Huggins sought to add more pitching talent. Before the 1922 season, Huggins acquired Johnny Mitchell from the Vernon Tigers of the Pacific Coast League and traded fan favorite Roger Peckinpaugh along with Rip Collins, Bill Piercy, and Jack Quinn to the Red Sox for Everett Scott, Bullet Joe Bush, and Sad Sam Jones. By this time, Ruppert hired Ed Barrow as the team's business manager, and he aided Huggins in player transactions. The Yankees repeated as AL champions that season, but lost the 1922 World Series, again to the Giants. With the newly gained confidence of his owners, Huggins was retained as manager. The Yankees won their first World Series in 1923, preventing the Giants from repeating as champions for the third consecutive season. They were unable to retain their title the following season however, finishing second in the AL to the Washington Senators. Huggins had come to regret his trade of Urban Shocker to the Browns. In St. Louis, the spitballer Shocker had come into his own as a starter, racking up four straight 20-win seasons in the years 1920‚Äì23 and leading the American League with 27 wins in 1921 and strikeouts the following year, when he won 24 games. Shocker was reacquired for Bullet Joe Bush, Milt Gaston and Joe Giard in December 1924. However, through 42 games of the 1925 season, the Yankees struggled, falling to seventh place in the eight-team AL, games out of first place. Huggins made wholesale changes to the Yankees' lineup, as he replaced Ward at second base with Howard Shanks, catchers Steve O'Neill and Wally Schang with Benny Bengough, and, most notably, Pipp with Lou Gehrig at first base, beginning Gehrig's record consecutive games played streak. Among the team's regulars, only Babe Ruth, Joe Dugan, and Bob Meusel remained in the lineup. However, the team continued to struggle; amid rumors that he might replace Huggins, Ruppert stated that \\"Miller Huggins will be manager as long as he cares to be\\". The Yankees fell to seventh place in the AL that season. With Ruppert's full support, Huggins' duties with the Yankees included keeping Ruth in line. Unafraid of his star player, Huggins and Ruth often clashed.Smelser, p. 195 Huggins suspended Ruth indefinitely on August 29, 1925 for \\"misconduct off the playing field\\", while also fining him $5,000 ($ in current dollar terms), and as it was an away game in St. Louis, Ruth was ordered to pay his own way back to New York. The actual reason was because he arrived late for batting practice after yet another night out the night before, though it was a culmination of his pranks and insistence of recruiting less able teammates to go clubbing with him, causing them to nurse hangovers. Ruth responded by claiming Ruppert would rescind the fine and suspension, and that he would never play for Huggins again, believing that Ruppert would side with him over Huggins. However, Ruppert insisted that the fine would stand and that Ruth would be suspended for as long as Huggins desired. After apologizing to Huggins and Ruppert, Ruth was reinstated on September 5. Ruth did not challenge Huggins' authority again. Huggins restructured the team for the 1926 season, giving starting jobs to Mark Koenig and Tony Lazzeri. That season, Huggins won his fourth pennant with the Yankees in 1926, marking the first time that a team won a pennant after finishing seventh the year prior. However, the Yankees lost the 1926 World Series to the Cardinals in seven games. Winning the pennant once again in the 1927 season, Huggins matched Cap Anson's mark of five pennants in seven seasons. That year, the Yankees benefited from the development of George Pipgras and Wilcy Moore, and set an American League record with 110 regular season victories, winning the AL by 19 games. The Yankees swept the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1927 World Series. This team became known as Murderers' Row, and is considered the one of the greatest teams in baseball history. Huggins remained confident in his team's ability to repeat as AL champions in 1928 season. Huggins supplemented his team by acquiring Bill Dickey from the minor leagues. He acquired Stan Coveleski, who was attempting to return to his peak years, but released him in August when the former star continued to struggle. The Yankees reached the 1928 World Series, winning their sixth pennant in eight years, and defeated the Cardinals 4 games to 0. This was the first time a team swept their opponents in consecutive World Series'.Koppett, p. 90 Huggins continued to tinker with his roster during the offseason. He traded Dugan, Mike Gazella, Rosy Ryan and Pat Collins, and acquired Lyn Lary from the Pacific Coast League. He tried Lary at third base and Leo Durocher at shortstop, while he attempted to acquire George Uhle and Ed Morris, but was unsuccessful in both cases. The Yankees fell behind the Philadelphia Athletics in the standings during the 1929 season and as it became clear that the Yankees would not win the AL pennant in 1929, Huggins began consulting with coaches Art Fletcher and Bob Shawkey about the future of the team, including how to replace Bob Meusel in left field. However, by August 1929 Huggins began losing weight and complained of feeling ill. Death The monument dedicated to Huggins by the New York Yankees in Monument Park Huggins fell ill on September 20, 1929, and checked into Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center for erysipelas. His condition was complicated by the development of influenza with high fever. The Yankees' club physician, in consultation with other doctors, decided to administer blood transfusions. But despite their best efforts, Huggins died at the age of 50 on September 25, 1929 of pyaemia. The American League canceled its games for September 27, the day of his funeral,Steinberg, Steve. Society of American Baseball Research Biography Project entry for Miller Huggins. (retrieved January 28, 2019)baseball-reference.com, MLB Scores and Standings Friday, September 27, 1929. (retrieved January 28, 2019) and his viewing at Yankee Stadium drew thousands of tearful fans. A moment of silence was held for Huggins before the start of Game 4 of the 1929 World Series (at Philadelphia's Shibe Park, after which the A's overcame an 8‚Äì0 Cubs advantage with 10 runs in the last of the seventh for a spectacular 10‚Äì8 come-from-behind victory and a 3‚Äì1 Series advantage). He was interred in Spring Grove Cemetery in his native Cincinnati. The Yankees found it difficult to replace Huggins. Art Fletcher managed the team for its final 11 games of the 1929 season, but he did not want to manage the team full-time. After the season, Ruppert offered the job in turn to Fletcher, Donie Bush and Eddie Collins, all of whom declined. Eventually, \\"Bob the Gob\\" Shawkey agreed to serve as the Yankees manager for the 1930 season, leading the team to a third-place finish. Playing and managing profile Huggins was listed at and . His small stature inspired the nicknames \\"Mighty Mite\\" and the \\"Mite Manager\\". He was also known as \\"Rabbit\\" and \\"Little Everywhere\\" for his ability to cover ground in the infield. An excellent leadoff batter and defensive second baseman, he ended his playing career with a .265 batting average and .956 fielding percentage. He led the league in walks four times and regularly posted an on-base percentage near .400. He scored 100 or more runs three times and regularly stole 30 or more bases for 324 lifetime steals. On the downside, in 1914 he set the single season caught-stealing record in the National League, when he was thrown out 36 times (as opposed to 32 successful steals). Huggins finished his managerial career with a 1413‚Äì1134 record. His 1413 wins as a manager ranks 23rd all-time (as of the start of the 2012 season). He learned his managerial strategy by observing Hanlon and Bresnahan. His managerial style at first emphasized speed, base-stealing, hit- and-run plays and \\"slap\\" (i.e., contact) hitting, but the acquisition of superstar slugger Ruth dictated a change of emphasis towards power and not giving away outs.Koppett, p. 88 For the slugging Yankees of the 1920s, he recruited power hitters and consistent (as opposed to brilliant) pitchers. Legacy In 1915, umpire and sportswriter Billy Evans, writing about the scarcity of competent second basemen in baseball, listed Huggins, Collins, Pratt, Johnny Evers, and Nap Lajoie as the best in the game. He later wrote that Huggins was \\"one of the greatest managers I have ever met\\". Bill James ranked Huggins as the 37th best second baseman of all time in 2001 in his The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract. The Yankees dedicated a monument to Huggins on May 30, 1932, placing it in front of the flagpole in center field at Yankee Stadium. Huggins was the first of many Yankees legends granted this honor, which eventually became \\"Monument Park\\", dedicated in 1976. The monument calls Huggins \\"A splendid character who made priceless contributions to baseball.\\" The Yankees also named a field at Al Lang Stadium, their spring training home, after Huggins. Huggins was included on the ballot for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1937, 1938, 1939, 1942, 1945, 1946, 1948, and 1950, failing to receive the number of votes required for election on those occasions. Named in the Honor Rolls of Baseball in 1946, the Veterans Committee elected Huggins to the Hall of Fame in February 1964, and he was posthumously inducted that summer. Personal life Huggins was a private man who kept to himself. He lived in Cincinnati during the winters while playing for the Reds and Cardinals, but began to make St. Petersburg, Florida his winter home while managing the Yankees. Huggins did not marry, and lived with his sister while in Cincinnati. Huggins invested in real estate holdings in Florida, although he sold them in 1926 (three years before the stock market crash, fortunately for him) as they took too much of his time away from baseball. He enjoyed playing golf and billiards in his spare time. He was portrayed by Ernie Adams in The Pride of the Yankees, Fred Lightner in The Babe Ruth Story, and Joe Ragno in The Babe.

His son, Frederick Richard Mallet was a geologist who worked in India. Early life Mallet was born in Dublin, on 3 June 1810, the son of factory owner John Mallet. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, entering it at the age of 16 and graduating in science and mathematics in 1830 at the age of 20. Career Following his graduation, he joined his father's iron foundry business and helped build the firm into one of the most important engineering works in Ireland, supplying ironwork for railway companies, the Fastnet Rock lighthouse, and a swing bridge over the River Shannon at Athlone. He also helped manufacture the characteristic iron railings that surround Trinity College and which bear his family name at the base. Mallet was elected to the Royal Irish Academy in 1832 at the early age of 22. He also enrolled in the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1835 which helped finance much of his research in seismology. In 1838 he became a life member of the Royal Geological Society of Ireland, and acted as its President from 1846-48\\\\. From 1848‚Äì1849 he constructed the Fastnet Rock lighthouse, southwest of Cape Clear. Seismological work On 9 February 1846 he presented to the Royal Irish Academy his paper, \\"On the Dynamics of Earthquakes\\", which is considered to be one of the foundations of modern seismology. He is also credited with coining the word \\"seismology\\" and other related words e.g. the isoseismal map, which he used in his research. He also coined the term epicentre. From 1852 to 1858, he was engaged (with his son, John William Mallet) in the preparation of his work, The Earthquake Catalogue of the British Association (1858), and carried out blasting experiments to determine the speed of seismic propagation in sand and solid rock. On 16 December 1857, the area around Padula, Italy, was devastated by the Great Neapolitan earthquake which caused 11,000 deaths. At the time it was the third largest known earthquake in the world and has been estimated to have been of magnitude 6.9 on the Richter Scale. Mallet, with letters of support from Charles Lyell and Charles Darwin, petitioned the Royal Society of London and received a grant of ¬£150 to go to Padula and record at first hand the devastation. The resulting report was presented to the Royal Society as the Report on the Great Neapolitan Earthquake of 1857. It was a major scientific work and made great use of the then new research tool of photography to record the devastation caused by the earthquake. In 1862, he published the \\"Great Neapolitan Earthquake of 1857: The First Principles of Observational Seismology\\" in two volumes; he brought forward evidence to show that the depth below the Earth's surface, from where the impulse of the Neapolitan earthquake originated, was about 8-9 geographical miles. One of Mallet's papers was Volcanic Energy: an Attempt to develop its True Origin and Cosmical Relations, in which he sought to show that volcanic heat may be attributed to the effects of crushing, contortion and other disturbances in the crust of the earth; the disturbances leading to the formation of lines of fracture, more or less vertical, down which water would find its way, and if the temperature generated be sufficient volcanic eruptions of steam or lava would follow. Other work Mallet's Mortar with 36-inch shells which would have contained 480 lb (217 kg) of gunpowder. During the Crimean War he designed a mortar of calibre capable of throwing a shell a distance of . The huge mortar was built in sections to allow transport, but was too late to be used in action. An example has been preserved at the Royal Artillery base in Woolwich and one is displayed before the Royal Armouries Fort Nelson near Portsmouth. Mallet was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1854, and in 1861 moved to London, where he became a consulting engineer and edited The Practical Mechanic's Journal. He was awarded the Telford Medal by the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1859, followed by the Cunningham Medal of the Royal Irish Academy for his research into the theory of earthquakes in 1862 and the Wollaston medal of the Geological Society of London in 1877, the Geological Society's highest award. Blind for the last seven years of his life, he died at Stockwell, London, on 5 November 1881 and is buried at West Norwood Cemetery.

(L√ºttich is the German name for the city of Li√®ge in Belgium, where the Germans had won a victory in the early days of August 1914 during World War I.) The offensive is also referred to in American and British histories of the Battle of Normandy as the Mortain counterattack. The assault was ordered by Adolf Hitler, to eliminate the gains made by the First United States Army during Operation Cobra and the subsequent weeks, and by reaching the coast in the region of Avranches at the base of the Cotentin peninsula, cut off the units of the Third United States Army which had advanced into Brittany. The main German striking force was the XLVII Panzer Corps, with one and a half SS Panzer Divisions and two Heer Panzer Divisions. Although they made initial gains against the defending U.S. VII Corps, they were soon halted and the Allies inflicted severe losses on the attacking troops, eventually destroying most of the German tanks involved in the attack. Although fighting continued around Mortain for six days, the American forces had regained the initiative within a day of the opening of the German attack. As the German commanders on the spot had warned Hitler in vain, there was little chance of the attack succeeding, and the concentration of their armoured reserves at the western end of the front in Normandy soon led to disaster, as they were outflanked to their south and the front to their east collapsed, resulting in many of the German troops in Normandy being trapped in the Falaise Pocket. Background On 25 July 1944, following six weeks of attritional warfare along a stalemated front, American forces under Lieutenant General Omar Bradley mounted an attack code- named Operation Cobra, which broke through the German defenses near Saint- L√¥.Van der Vat, p.163 Almost the entire western half of the German front in Normandy collapsed, and on 1 August, American forces captured Avranches. With the capture of this town at the base of the Cotentin peninsula, and an intact bridge at Pontaubault nearby, the American forces had \\"turned the corner\\"; the German front could no longer be anchored against the sea at its western end and American forces could advance west and south into Brittany.D'Este, p.409 The U.S. Third Army, commanded by Lieutenant General George S. Patton, was activated the same day.D'Este, p.408 Despite German air attacks against the bridge at Pontaubault, Patton pushed no less than seven divisions across it during the next three days, and units of his army began advancing almost unopposed towards the Brittany ports.Wilmot, p.399 Beginning on 30 July, the British Second Army, under Lieutenant-General Miles C. Dempsey, mounted a supporting attack (code-named Operation Bluecoat) on the eastern flank of the American armies. Much of the German armored reserves being rushed west to halt the American breakthrough were diverted to face this new threat. Meanwhile, the U.S. continued its attacks to widen the corridor around Avranches. Although the Germans held the vital road junction of Vire, U.S. VII Corps, under Major General J. Lawton Collins, captured Mortain, east of Avranches, on 3 August. The next day, although U.S. VIII Corps continued to advance west through Brittany toward the ports of Brest and Lorient, Bradley ordered Patton to drive eastward with the main body of the U.S. Third Army, around the open German flank and into the German rear areas.Wilmot, p.400 U.S. XV Corps advanced no less than during the next three days, and by 7 August they were approaching Le Mans, formerly the location of the headquarters of the German 7th Army, and still an important logistic center. German command and decisions Generalfeldmarshall G√ºnther von Kluge was the German supreme commander in the West. After Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel was injured by Allied aircraft on 17 July, Kluge also took over direct command of Army Group B, the formation conducting the battle in Normandy. He had warned Hitler on 22 July that the collapse of the front was imminent, but Hitler continued to order him to stand fast. On 2 August, Hitler sent a directive to Kluge ordering \\"an immediate counter-attack between Mortain and Avranches\\".D'Este, p. 414 General Walter Warlimont‚Äîthe Deputy Chief of Staff at OKW, the German armed forces headquarters‚Äîwas also sent to Kluge's headquarters to ensure these orders were complied with. Kluge suggested that there was no chance of success, and the German forces in Normandy should retire to the Seine River, pivoting on the intact defences south of Caen, but on 4 August, Hitler categorically ordered the attack to be launched. He demanded that eight of the nine Panzer Divisions in Normandy be used in the attack, and that the Luftwaffe commit its entire reserve, including 1,000 fighters.Wilmot, p.401 According to Hitler, three qualifications had to be met for the attack to proceed. \\"Von Kluge must believe in it. He must be able to detach enough armour from the main front in Normandy to create an effective striking force, and he must achieve surprise\\".Lewin, p. 338 Although ordered to wait \\"until every tank, gun and plane was assembled\\", Kluge and SS General Paul Hausser (commanding the German 7th Army, which held the western part of the front) decided to attack as soon as possible, before the overall situation deteriorated further. The main striking force assigned was the XLVII Panzer Corps, commanded by General Hans Freiherr von Funck. Instead of eight Panzer Divisions, only four‚Äîone of them incomplete‚Äîcould be relieved from their defensive tasks and assembled in time; the 2nd Panzer Division, 116th Panzer Division, the 2nd SS Panzer Division and part of the 1st SS Panzer Division, with a total of about 300 tanks.Fey, p.145 The Panzer Corps was supported by two Infantry Divisions and five Kampfgruppen, formed from the remnants of the Panzer Lehr Division and four equally battered infantry divisions. Kluge ordered the attack to be mounted on the night of 6/7 August. To avoid alerting American forces to the attack, there would be no preparatory artillery bombardments. The intention was to hit the U.S. 30th Infantry Division, commanded by Major-General Leland Hobbs, east of Mortain,Van Der Vat, p.164 then cut through American defenses to reach the coast. Had surprise been achieved, the attack might well have succeeded, but Allied decoders at Ultra had intercepted and decrypted the orders for Operation L√ºttich by August 4.D'Este, p.415 As a result, Bradley was able to obtain air support from both the US 9th Air Force and the RAF.D'Este, p.416 German attacks American forces in Mortain, August 1944 At 22:00 on 6 August, von Funck reported that his troops were still not concentrated, and the commander of the 116th Panzer Division \\"had made a mess of things\\".Wilmot, p.402 In fact, this officer (Gerhard von Schwerin) had been so pessimistic about the operation that he had not even ordered his tank units to take part. This delay disjointed the German attack, but on the German left flank, the SS Panzer troops attacked the positions of the American 30th Infantry Division east of Mortain shortly after midnight. The Germans achieved temporary surprise, as the Ultra documents had arrived at U.S. First Army Headquarters too late to alert the troops to the immediate assault.D'Este, p.419 They briefly captured Mortain but were unable to breach the lines of the 30th Division, as the 2nd Battalion of the 120th Infantry Regiment commanded Hill 314, the dominant feature around Mortain.D'Este, p.418 Although cut off, they were supplied by parachute drops. Of the 700 men who defended the position until 12 August, over 300 were killed or wounded.Mortain, Hill 314 in 2009. Position of the 2nd Battalion/120th Infantry Regiment which was surrounded by the 2nd SS Panzer Division. To the north, the 2nd Panzer Division attacked several hours later, aiming south-west toward Avranches. It managed to penetrate several miles into the American lines, before being stopped by the 35th Infantry Division and a combat command of the 3rd Armored Division only short of Avranches. The German High Command ordered the attacks to be renewed before the afternoon, so that Avranches could be taken.Fey, p.146 Allied air strikes‚Äîthe offensive stalls By noon of 7 August, the early morning fog had dispersed, and large numbers of Allied aircraft appeared over the battlefield. With the advance knowledge of the attack provided by Ultra, the U.S. 9th Air Force had been reinforced by the RAF Second Tactical Air Force. Despite assurances by the Luftwaffe that German forces would have adequate air support, the Allied aircraft quickly achieved complete control of the airspace over Mortain. The Luftwaffe reported that its fighters were engaged by Allied aircraft from the moment they took off, and were unable even to reach the battlefield.Wilmot, p.404 In the open ground east of Mortain, the German Panzers became exposed targets, especially for rocket-firing Hawker Typhoon fighter bombers of the RAF. Traditional accounts of the Allied fighter bomber attacks in the Battle of Mortain accepted the claims of the pilots of over two hundred destroyed German tanks. However, subsequent detailed studies of the battlefield showed that most of the destroyed German armor were knocked out by gunfire from ground forces and that the main effect of the Allied air attacks had been to destroy the unarmored vehicles and troops in the German offensive, as well as forcing the German armor to disperse to cover. The accuracy of the rockets and bombs of the Allied fighter-bombers was simply too poor to destroy more than a few of the German tanks, although fear of being incinerated inside a tank should a rocket or bomb actually strike a tank did cause some of the inexperienced German tank crews to abandon their tanks intact while under air attack.Gooderson, 1997 pp. 111‚Äì117 In one British study, it was found that the average Typhoon pilot firing a barrage of all eight rockets had only a four percent chance of striking a target the size of a tank.Gooderson, 1997 p. 76 American counter-moves Allied and Axis attacks and counter-attacks from 6‚Äì7 August 1944 Through 7 August, American troops had continued to press south near Vire, on the right flank of the German attack. The 116th Panzer Division‚Äîwhich was supposed to advance in this sector‚Äîwas actually driven back. In the afternoon, the 1st SS and 116th Panzer Divisions made renewed attacks, but the flanks of the Mortain positions had been sealed off, allowing the American VII Corps to contain the German advance. Meanwhile, Bradley had sent two armoured combat commands against the German southern (left) flank. On 8 August, one of these (from the U.S. 2nd Armored Division) was attacking the rear of the two SS Panzer Divisions. Although fighting would continue around Mortain for several more days, there was no further prospect of any German success.D'Este, p. 420 The Germans issued orders to go on to the defensive along the entire front, but poorly communicated orders resulted in this being impossible to achieve, with some German forces retreating, and others preparing to hold their ground.Fey, p.147 As the U.S. First Army counter- attacked German units near Mortain, units of Patton's 3rd Army were advancing unchecked through the open country to the south of the German armies, and had taken Le Mans on 8 August. The same day, the First Canadian Army attacked the weakened German positions south of Caen in Operation Totalize and threatened to break through to Falaise, although this attack stalled after two days. In desperation, Hitler ordered the attacks against Mortain to be renewed with greater intensity, demanding that the 9th Panzer Division, almost the only formation opposing Patton's advance east from Le Mans, be transferred to Mortain to take part in the attack. General Heinrich Eberbach‚Äîcommander of Panzergruppe West‚Äîwas ordered to form a new headquarters, named \\"Panzer Group Eberbach\\", to command the renewed offensive.Wilmot, p. 414 Kluge‚Äîwho feared he was about to be implicated by the Gestapo in the 20 July Plot‚Äîacquiesced in this apparently suicidal order.Cawthorne, p.125 Eberbach's proposed counter- attack was soon overtaken by events, and was never mounted. Aftermath By 13 August, the offensive had fully halted, with German forces being driven out of Mortain. The Germans had lost 120 tanks and assault guns to Allied counter- attacks and air strikes, more than two-thirds of their committed total.Fey, p.150 As Hitler ordered German forces in Normandy to hold their positions, the U.S. VII and XV Corps were swinging east and north toward Argentan. The German attack west left the 7th Army and Panzergruppe West in danger of being encircled by Allied forces. As American forces advanced on Argentan, British and Canadian forces advanced on Falaise, threatening to cut off both armies in the newly formed Falaise Pocket. Although American casualties in Operation L√ºttich were significantly lighter than in previous operations, certain sectors of the front, notably the positions held by the 30th Division around Mortain, took severe casualties. By the end of 7 August alone, nearly 1,000 men of the 30th Division had been killed. Estimates for American casualties from 6‚Äì13 August vary from 2,000-3,000 fatalities, with an unknown number of wounded.Cawthorne, p. 126 On 14 August, Canadian forces launched Operation Tractable, in conjunction with American movements northwards to Chambois. On 19 August, a brigade of the Polish 1st Armoured Division linked up with forces of the 90th U.S. Infantry Division, sealing off some 50,000 German troops in the pocket. By 21 August, German attempts to reopen the gap had been thwarted, and all German troops trapped in the pocket surrendered to Allied forces, effectively putting an end to the German 7th Army.Cawthorne, p. 129 Footnotes References * Buisson, Jules and Gilles (1946) Mortain et sa bataille, 2‚Äì13 ao√ªt 1944.

It was discovered on 24 September 1960, by Dutch astronomer couple Ingrid and Cornelis van Houten, and Dutch‚ÄìAmerican astronomer Tom Gehrels during the Palomar‚ÄìLeiden survey at Palomar Observatory in California, United States. It was later named after Epimetheus from Greek mythology.  Classification and orbit  The S-type asteroid is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest groups of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.0‚Äì2.4 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,211 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.09 and an inclination of 4¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation, as the previous identifications, and , made at Johannesburg and Uccle in 1942 and 1950, respectively, remained unused.  Physical characteristics   Rotation period  Two divergent rotational lightcurves of Epimetheus were obtained from photometric observations. They gave a rotation period of 10.9 and 28.6 hours with both having a brightness variation of 0.04 magnitude ().  Diameter and albedo  According to the survey carried out by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Epimetheus measures 7.7 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.27, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.24 ‚Äì derived from 8 Flora, the largest member and namesake of its orbital family ‚Äì and calculates a diameter of 8.2 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 12.6.  Survey designation  The survey designation \\"P-L\\" stands for Palomar‚ÄìLeiden, named after Palomar Observatory and Leiden Observatory, which collaborated on the fruitful Palomar‚ÄìLeiden survey in the 1960s. Gehrels used Palomar's Samuel Oschin telescope (also known as the 48-inch Schmidt Telescope), and shipped the photographic plates to Ingrid and Cornelis van Houten at Leiden Observatory where astrometry was carried out. The trio are credited with the discovery of several thousand minor planets.  Naming  This minor planet is named for the Titan in Greek mythology, Epimetheus, who opened Pandora's box, which contained all the illnesses and ailments of mankind (also see 55 Pandora). Epimetheus is also a moon of Saturn, which was discovered by Voyager 1 in 1980. Epimetheus is the brother of Prometheus after whom the minor planet 1809 Prometheus was named. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 20 February 1976 ().

History The Arizona State Highway system was introduced on September 9, 1927, by the State Highway Commission (formed on August 11 of the same year). It incorporated the new federal aid system and also the U.S. Highway system. The 1927 plan included 27 state routes, most of which were simply dirt roads. Until 1942, the state route marker signs contained a Native American swastika that were used by Navajos, but were removed after the U.S.'s entry into World War II against Nazi Germany which had a reversed swastika as its emblem and became strongly negatively associated with the Nazis. The modern system was introduced and adopted in the 1950s. Arizona state highway marker used from the late 1920s to the early 1940s. Present-day state route marker Designations and nomenclatures The Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) internally recognizes Interstate Highways, U.S. Highways and Arizona Highways as all being separate types of highway designations. State highways within Arizona are referred to as Arizona State Routes or State Routes, with the prefix \\"SR\\" being used for abbreviations. ADOT also recognizes seven different types of suffixed routes for the U.S. Highways and State Routes. The recognized suffixes consist of the following with \\"(Number)\\" filling in for a numeric designation: *Alternate (A) ‚Äì Referred to as \\"State Route (Number)A\\" and abbreviated as \\"SR (Number)A\\". *Business Route (B) ‚Äì Referred to as \\"State Business Route (Number)\\" and abbreviated as \\"SR (Number)B\\" or \\"SR (Number) Bus.\\". *Loop Route (L) ‚Äì Referred to as \\"State Loop Route (Number)\\" and abbreviated as \\"SR (Number)L\\". Despite often having \\"Loop\\" within their titles, SR 101, SR 202 and SR 303 are not considered \\"Loop Routes\\" by ADOT, nor are Interstate Business Loops. To date, SR 89L has been the only Loop Route recognized by ADOT. *Spur (S) ‚Äì Referred to as \\"State Route (Number) Spur\\" and abbreviated as \\"SR (Number)S\\" or \\"SR (Number) Spur\\". *Truck (T) - Referred to as \\"State Route (Number) Truck\\" and abbreviated as \\"SR (Number) Truck\\". *Temporary (X) - Publicly referred to as \\"State Route (Number) Temporary\\" or \\"State Route (Number)T\\" and abbreviated \\"SR (Number)T\\". Internally referred to as \\"State Route (Number)X\\" and abbreviated \\"SR (Number)X\\". *Wye Leg (Y) - Referred to as \\"State Route (Number)Y\\" and abbreviated \\"SR (Number)Y\\". U.S. Highways can also use the same suffixes listed above. Usually the suffixed routes are recognized by ADOT as U.S. Highways. For example, the Alternate route of U.S. Route 89 (US 89) is referred to as U.S. Route 89A (US 89A) instead of State Route 89A (SR 89A). The only exception to this rule is SR 93X, which is a suffixed route of US 93. Suffixed routes for Interstates are a different story. Although the suffixed routes are signed with Interstate green Business shields, they are recognized by ADOT as suffixed State Routes. In the field, Interstate 10 business routes are signed as Interstate 10 Business Loop or Interstate 10 Business Spur, while they are referred to by ADOT as \\"State Business Route 10\\" (SR 10B) and \\"State Route 10 Spur\\" (SR 10 Spur). The same principle applies with business routes for all other Interstates in Arizona. Designations listed under Highway Logs and GIS data however, use the Arizona Transportation Information System (ATIS) nomenclature. The ATIS designation for a non-suffixed state route is \\"S (Number)\\". The number at the end is always three digits long. As such, all two digit routes are referred to under the ATIS terminology as \\"S 0(Number)\\". SR 260 and SR 79 are known under ATIS nomenclature as \\"S 260\\" and \\"S 079\\" respectively. U.S. Highways replace the prefix \\"S\\" used by State Routes under the ATIS nomenclature with \\"U\\" while Interstate Highways use the prefix \\"I\\". Suffixed routes under ATIS always have the internally applied suffix between the prefix. State Business Route 79 under ATIS nomenclature is referred to as \\"SB079\\" and SR 93X is \\"SX093\\". State Routes Unbuilt routes Some routes listed here were eventually constructed using other route numbers. Arizona Parkways, Historic and Scenic Roads Official marker for roads under the Arizona Parkways, Historic and Scenic Roads program. Currently, the Arizona Department of Transportation recognizes 26 state designated routes under the Parkways, Historic and Scenic Roads Program.

Early years Qui√±ones (birth name: Francisco Mariano Qui√±ones Qui√±ones) was born into a wealthy family of landowners in San Germ√°n, Puerto Rico, and at a young age developed his lifelong love for literature and journalism. He was sent to Europe where he attended private schools. After he finished his secondary education (high school), he went on to university studies in Bremen, Germany, France, and New York. When Qui√±ones returned to Puerto Rico in 1848, he went to work for the family business.Biography Abolitionist In 1865, the Spanish Crown requested from the municipalities of Puerto Rico recommendations for new laws and Qui√±ones was elected representative for San Germ√°n. In 1867, Qui√±ones represented Puerto Rico before the \\"Overseas Information Committee\\" meeting in Spain. Together with Segundo Ruiz Belvis and Jos√© Juli√°n Acosta, he demanded the abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico and also protested over the injustices practiced by the governor General Palacio in the island. Politician When Qui√±ones returned to the island, he joined the Puerto Rican Liberal Reformist Party and in 1871 was elected as representative in front of the Spanish Courts. In Spain he continued his fight for the abolition of slavery. In 1887, Qui√±ones joined the Autonomist Party headed by Luis Mu√±oz Rivera. There were some disagreements between Mu√±oz and some of the members which led to a rupture in the party. Among those who abandoned the party were Qui√±ones and Jos√© Celso Barbosa, who went on to form the Orthodox Autonomist Party. On February 10, 1898, Spain granted Puerto Rico the rights to self-determination, which was considered the first step towards independence. Qui√±ones was named President of Puerto Rico's first Cabinet by General Mac√≠as. In 1898, after the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War when Puerto Rico became a colonial territory of the United States, Qui√±ones joined the Puerto Rican Republican Party founded by Jos√© Celso Barbosa and which championed the idea of converting Puerto Rico into a state of the U.S..

It drains part of the Cascade Range east of Eugene and flows westward into the southernmost end of the Willamette Valley. It is named for Donald McKenzie, a Scottish Canadian fur trader who explored parts of the Pacific Northwest for the Pacific Fur Company in the early 19th century.McArthur, pp. 628‚Äì629Mackenzie, p. 91 As of the 21st century, six large dams have been built on the McKenzie and its tributaries.\\"About the McKenzie Watershed\\". McKenzie Watershed Council. Retrieved January 9, 2010. Course The McKenzie River originates as the outflow of Clear Lake in the high Cascades of eastern Linn County in the Willamette National Forest. (Clear Lake is fed by Ikenick Creek and Fish Lake Creek, the latter of which flows from Fish Lake. Fish Lake's main tributary is Hackleman Creek, which drains the north side of Browder Ridge east of Tombstone Pass. U.S. Route 20 crosses the pass and follows Hackleman Creek.) The McKenzie River flows south from Clear Lake, paralleled by Oregon Route 126, and goes over the Sahalie and Koosah waterfalls to Carmen Reservoir, a man-made lake from which the river is then diverted into a tunnel to Smith Reservoir.General course info from USGS topographic maps accessed via the \\"GNIS in Google Map\\" feature of the USGS Geographic Names Information System website; and Sullivan, pp. 170‚Äì173 Between Carmen Reservoir and Tamolitch Falls, the riverbed is dry for because lava from Belknap Crater buried that stretch of the river about 1,600 years ago.

It then flows south into Trail Bridge Reservoir, where the Smith River enters from the right. After passing through Trail Bridge Dam, the river enters Lane County. The McKenzie continues south to Belknap Springs, where it turns west and flows past the community of McKenzie Bridge. It receives the South Fork McKenzie River about three miles east of Blue River. (The South Fork rises near the Pacific Crest Trail in the Three Sisters Wilderness and flows north-northwest for about through Cougar Reservoir and Cougar Dam.) After the South Fork confluence, the main stem of the McKenzie River continues west through a narrow valley in the mountains, receiving the Blue River from the north at the community of Blue River. The McKenzie then passes Vida and continues to Leaburg and Walterville. The McKenzie valley widens as the river continues west, receiving the Mohawk River from the northeast just north of Springfield. Emerging from the Cascade foothills, the McKenzie enters a broad floodplain. It joins the Willamette River from the east north of Eugene.Risley, et al., p. 4 Watershed Cougar Dam and reservoir on the South Fork McKenzie River The McKenzie River drains a region of about and is one of the primary tributaries of the Willamette River. Elevations in the watershed range from at the summit of the South Sister to at the McKenzie's mouth on the Willamette River north of Eugene. The upper basin, in the high Cascades, consists of granular, permeable igneous rocks that are geologically young, while most of the middle and lower McKenzie valley in the Western Cascades is made of the remnants of older, more weathered volcanic rocks. Major watersheds bordering the McKenzie basin include the Calapooia; the South, Middle and North Santiam rivers to the north; the Middle Fork Willamette River to the south; and the Deschutes River to the east. Most of the watershed is lightly populated; about 70 percent of it is public land managed by the U.S. Government, of which about 39 percent is the Three Sisters Wilderness. Over 96 percent of the basin is forested, just under 4 percent is devoted to agricultural use--mainly farms and orchards on the lower floodplain --and the remainder is residential or industrial.Morgenstern, et al., p. 2 Most of the public land is part of the Willamette National Forest and is important for logging and recreation. The river is the sole tap water source for the cities of Eugene and Springfield, fulfilling the water needs of about 200,000 people. The Eugene Water & Electric Board (EWEB) utility draws the water at river mile (RM) 11 or river kilometer (RK) 18 in Springfield. Water quality in the river is rated good to excellent, with better quality upstream than downstream. Principal sources of contaminants in the McKenzie are agriculture and residential development, including septic systems.Morgenstern, et al., p. 67 Small amounts of herbicides detected in the river and some of its tributaries may be from aerial spraying by timber companies for forestry. The region has a temperate climate with wet winters and dry summers. About 90 percent of precipitation in the watershed comes between October and May. Precipitation in the basin varies greatly with elevation; about fall annually in the Willamette Valley, while the Three Sisters in the high Cascades can receive in a year. Above , about 35 percent of precipitation falls as snow, and at and higher, over 75 percent of precipitation is snowfall. At these elevations, melting snow beginning in the spring season brings more cold water out of springs under the permeable rock, increasing the McKenzie's flow and maintaining cold water temperatures in the river and its tributaries. Along the lower McKenzie, however, winter rain slides easily off the less permeable rock and erodes sediment into the river.Risley, et al., p. 6 Engineering There are six major dams in the McKenzie River watershed‚Äîthree on the river and three each on a different tributary of the McKenzie.Risley, et al., p. 3 The three dams on the McKenzie's main stem form Carmen Reservoir, Trail Bridge Reservoir, and Leaburg Reservoir, respectively.Williams, Gerald W. \\"McKenzie River\\". The Oregon Encyclopedia. Portland State University. Retrieved January 11, 2011. The other dams in the watershed are the Smith River dam on the Smith River in the upper basin, Cougar Dam on the South Fork McKenzie River, and Blue River Dam on the Blue River. The Carmen Diversion Dam is the uppermost dam on the McKenzie, located less than south of Clear Lake, the McKenzie River's source. Water from Carmen Reservoir is diverted southwest through a tunnel to Smith Reservoir on the Smith River. Through both the Smith River and another tunnel, water in Smith Reservoir moves south to the Carmen Power Plant, then into Trail Bridge Reservoir‚Äîwhich the McKenzie joins‚Äîand through the power-producing Trail Bridge Dam. The engineered system is called the Carmen-Smith Hydroelectric Project, and it has been used by the Eugene Water & Electric Board since 1963 to generate electricity for EWEB customers. The system's generating capacity is 114 megawatts (MW). EWEB also owns and manages two power-producing canals farther downstream along the McKenzie River. The Walterville Canal, completed in 1910, and the Leaburg Canal, completed in 1930, each contain water diverted from the McKenzie to produce electricity. Most of the water is returned to the river after power production.Risley, et al., pp. 8, 10 Communities The McKenzie at Nimrod The eastern portion of Oregon Route 126 passes through the valley of the McKenzie River, closely following the river for much of its route. The stretch of the river from the edge of the Springfield metro area eastward to the Cascades is known as the McKenzie Valley. The following communities, listed west to east, are in the valley: Cedar Flat, Walterville, Deerhorn, Leaburg, Vida, Nimrod, Finn Rock, Blue River, Rainbow, McKenzie Bridge, and Belknap Springs. History For about 8,000 years, the McKenzie River has been home to Native Americans. In more recent history, Kalapuya and Molala tribes lived nomadically in the summer and spent winters in the lower valley. This way of life continued until the mid-19th century, when many natives died of disease or were relocated to reservations. The first recorded exploration of the river occurred in the spring of 1812, when the Pacific Fur Company reached the McKenzie via the Willamette River, as part of a larger exploration led by Donald McKenzie. The company had established a post in 1811 at Fort Astoria at the mouth of the Columbia River for the Astor Expedition. McKenzie, the following spring, formed a party to explore the Willamette River. The party found a large tributary of the Willamette River and named it after McKenzie. However, much of the McKenzie River remained largely unvisited by white settlers and explorers until October 1853, when a group of Oregon Trail settlers became lost trying to cross the Cascades into the Willamette Valley via the Elliott Cutoff. In 1910, travelers completed the first automobile crossing over McKenzie Pass. However, crossing along the river was limited to summer because winter conditions closed the pass. Year-round travel was not possible until 1960, with the completion of a road over Santiam Pass. Flora and fauna Northern spotted owl in the McKenzie watershed Fish in the McKenzie River and some of its tributaries include spring Chinook salmon, mountain whitefish, and bull, cutthroat and rainbow trout. Dippers, mergansers, bald eagles, ospreys, and various ducks feed on the fish. The threatened northern spotted owl inhabits dense forest on the west side of the upper McKenzie basin in Linn County. Forests of Douglas fir, western hemlock, and western red cedar cover the vast majority of the watershed. Recreation The McKenzie River is popular for boating‚Äîespecially fishing, kayaking, and whitewater rafting. The McKenzie River dory (or drift boat), specifically designed for use in whitewater, was first developed on the Mckenzie in the 1940s; adaptations of this design quickly grew in popularity on other Western rivers such as the Rogue and the Colorado. Boating is also common on Blue River Reservoir and Cougar Reservoir. Hiking and mountain biking are popular activities on trails in the McKenzie watershed. Trails include the McKenzie River National Recreation Trail, which follows much of the upper McKenzie.

Carboxyhemoglobin or carboxyhaemoglobin (symbol COHb or HbCO) is a stable complex of carbon monoxide and hemoglobin (Hb) that forms in red blood cells upon contact with carbon monoxide (CO). Carboxyhemoglobin is often mistaken for the compound formed by the combination of carbon dioxide and hemoglobin, which is actually carbaminohemoglobin. Exposure to small concentrations of CO hinder the ability of Hb to deliver oxygen to the body, because carboxyhemoglobin forms more readily than does oxyhemoglobin (HbO2). CO is produced in normal metabolism and is also a common chemical. Tobacco smoking (through carbon monoxide inhalation) raises the blood levels of COHb by a factor of several times from its normal concentrations. Affinity of Hb for CO Hemoglobin contains four heme groups each capable of reversibly binding to one oxygen molecule. Oxygen binding to any of these sites causes a conformational change in the protein, facilitating binding to each of the other sites. Carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin at the same sites as oxygen, but approximately 210 times more tightly. Normally, oxygen would bind to hemoglobin in the lungs and be released in areas with low oxygen partial pressure (e.g. active muscles). When carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin, it cannot be released as easily as oxygen. The slow release rate of carbon monoxide causes an accumulation of CO- bound hemoglobin molecules as exposure to carbon monoxide continues. Because of this, fewer hemoglobin particles are available to bind and deliver oxygen, thus causing the gradual suffocation associated with carbon monoxide poisoning. Carbon monoxide as a poison Since COHb releases carbon monoxide slowly, less hemoglobin will be available to transport oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Conversion of most Hb to COHb results in death - known medically as carboxyhemoglobinemia or carbon monoxide poisoning. Smaller amounts COHb lead to oxygen deprivation of the body causing tiredness, dizziness, and unconsciousness. COHb has a half-life in the blood of 4 to 6 hours. This time can be reduced to 70 to 35 minutes with administration of pure oxygen (the lower number applying when oxygen is administered with 4 to 5% CO2 to cause hyperventilation). Additionally, treatment in a hyperbaric chamber is a more effective manner of reducing the half-life of COHb than administering oxygen alone. This treatment involves pressurizing the chamber with pure oxygen at an absolute pressure close to three atmospheres, allowing the body's fluids, instead of the crippled hemoglobin bonded to CO, to absorb oxygen and to pass free oxygen on to hypoxic tissues. In effect, the need for hemoglobin in the blood is (partially) bypassed. Supplemental oxygen takes advantage of Le Chatelier's principle to quicken the decomposition of carboxyhemoglobin back to hemoglobin: HbCO + O2 ‚áå Hb + CO + O2 ‚áå HbO2 \\\\+ CO COHb increases risk of blood clot. It is thought that through this mechanism, smoking increases the risk of having thromboembolic disease. Pregnant smokers may give birth to babies of a lower birth mass. In addition to vasoconstriction of the placenta, another theory is that since fetal hemoglobin takes up carbon monoxide more readily than in an adult, therefore the fetus of a smoker will suffer from mild hypoxia, potentially retarding its development. Carbon monoxide as normal biological metabolite and potential pharmaceutical In biology, carbon monoxide is naturally produced by the action of heme oxygenase 1 and 2 on the heme from hemoglobin breakdown. This process produces a certain amount of carboxyhemoglobin in normal persons, even if they do not breathe carbon monoxide. Following the first report that carbon monoxide is a normal neurotransmitter in 1993, as well as one of three gasses which naturally modulate inflammatory responses in the body (the other two being nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide), carbon monoxide has received a great deal of clinical attention as a biological regulator. In many tissues, all three gases are known to act as anti-inflammatories, vasodilators and encouragers of neovascular growth. However, the issues are complex, as neovascular growth is not always beneficial, since it plays a role in tumor growth, and also the damage from wet macular degeneration, a disease for which smoking (a major source of carbon monoxide in the blood, several times more than natural production) increases the risk from 4 to 6 times. Studies involving carbon monoxide have been conducted in many laboratories throughout the world for its anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties. These properties could potentially be used to prevent the development of a series of pathological conditions including ischemic reperfusion injury, transplant rejection, atherosclerosis, severe sepsis, severe malaria or autoimmunity. Clinical tests involving humans have been performed. , however, the results had not yet been released. Based on the therapeutic potential of carbon monoxide, pharmaceutical efforts have focused on development of carbon monoxide-releasing molecules and selective heme oxygenase inducers.

AP5 blocks the cellular analog of classical conditioning in the sea slug Aplysia californica, and has similar effects on Aplysia long-term potentiation (LTP), since NMDA receptors are required for both. It is sometimes used in conjunction with the calcium chelator BAPTA to determine whether NMDARs are required for a particular cellular process. AP5/APV has also been used to study NMDAR-dependent LTP in the mammalian hippocampus.Gustafsson B., Wigstr√∂m H., Abraham W.C., and Huang Y.Y. Long-Term Potentiation in the Hippocampus Using Depolarizing Current Pulses as the Conditioning Stimulus to Single Volley Synaptic Potentials. Journal of Neuroscience. 1987 March;7(3):774-780 In general, AP5 is very fast-acting within in vitro preparations, and can block NMDA receptor action at a reasonably small concentration. The active isomer of AP5 is considered to be the D configuration, although many preparations are available as a racemic mixture of D and L-isomers. It is useful to isolate the action of other glutamate receptors in the brain, i.e., AMPA and kainate receptors. AP5 can block the conversion of a silent synapse to an active one, since this conversion is NMDA receptor-dependent. AP5 was developed by Jeff Watkins and Harry Olverman.

It is found in coastal saltwater marshes and, in Florida, also on inland waters. The nest is a well-concealed cup in trees or shrubs near water; three to five eggs are laid. The male boat-tailed grackle is long and weighs . Adult males have entirely iridescent black plumage, a long dark bill, a pale yellowish or brown iris, and a long keel-shaped tail. The adult female is much smaller at long and a weight of . She is also distinguished by her shorter tail and tawny-brown coloration, which covers the body apart from the darker wings and tail. The wingspan in adult birds is . In standard measurements, this species measures along the wing bone, in tail length, along the culmen, and along the tarsus. On average, the boat-tailed grackle weighs about 10% more than the closely related great-tailed grackle, although the male great-tailed grackle has an even longer tail. Young males are black but lack the adult's iridescence. Immature females are duller versions of the adult female and have blotches or spots on the breast. The eye color of the boat-tailed grackle varies with range. Gulf Coast and inland birds have dark eyes, whereas Atlantic birds have pale eyes. The boat-tailed grackle was first described by French naturalist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1819. Its specific epithet major means \\"larger\\" in Latin. Despite its restricted range, there are four subspecies of the boat-tailed grackle, differing in size and iris color. The boat-tailed grackle was once considered the same species as the great-tailed grackle. The great-tailed species is generally quite similar of slightly smaller body size but has a longer tail and lacks this species' distinct domed head shape. The common grackle, with which the boat-tailed species often overlaps along the Atlantic coastline, is noticeably smaller and shorter-tailed, as well as lacking the domed head shape.

It is roughly northeast of Twentynine Palms. Prior to 2015, the town's business district contained a post office, a historic restaurant-motel, and a Route 66 tourist shop. The Salt Ponds of Amboy at sunset Roy's Caf√© & Motel Geography The town is south of the Granite Mountains, Providence Mountains, and the Mojave National Preserve. Adjacent to the south is the landmark Amboy Crater, and beyond to the southeast the Bullion Mountains. To the south is Bristol Dry Lake and the community of Cadiz, California. Amboy was once a major stop along the famous Route 66, but has seen much lower visitation since the opening of Interstate 40 to the north in 1973. Amboy is home to Roy's Motel and Caf√©, a Route 66 landmark. The town has a total of 10 surviving buildings and a population of far fewer than the advertised 20. According to the Los Angeles Times, the town's population is approximately four. A resident interviewed in a short 2014 documentary also gives the population as four, all of whom are men. Amboy is located in ZIP code 92304 and area codes 442 and 760. History Although Amboy was first settled in 1858, the town was not established until 1883. Lewis Kingman, a locating engineer for the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad, created the town as the first of a series of alphabetical railroad stations that were to be constructed across the Mojave Desert. In 1926, Amboy became a boom town after the opening of U.S. Route 66. In 1938, Roy's Motel and Caf√© opened and prospered due to its isolated location on the route. By 1940, Amboy's population had increased to 65. Its growth was tied not only to tourists, but also to the Santa Fe Railroad over which freight trains still run today between Kingman, Arizona and the BNSF Railway Barstow, California yard. During the Great Depression and World War II, tourism declined nationally. But the remaining travelers' need for lodging, meals and gasoline kept the town busy. The town remained this way until the opening of Interstate 40 in 1973, which bypassed Amboy.History of Amboy, California Retrieved on 2010-1-12 Attractions Amboy Crater, as viewed from the east Nearby craters Two extinct volcanoes are located to the west of Amboy.

Both Roy's and the surrounding town were once owned by Buster Burris, one of Route 66's most famous characters who purchased Roy's from his father-in-law Roy Crowl, the man for whom the property is named, in 1938 and ran the town until 1995.Mike Anton, Destiny in the desert, Los Angeles Times, January 17, 2007. In 1938, Roy Crowl opened \\"Roy's\\" as a service station on Route 66 in Amboy. Roy, together with his wife Velma, owned the town. In the 1940s Roy teamed up with Herman \\"Buster\\" Burris who married his daughter Betty. Together they expanded the business, keeping it open 24 hours a day and adding the motel to the service station and caf√©. Business boomed in the deluge of motor tourists after World War II. The routing of the old National Trails Highway (1914) and its better-traveled successor, Route 66 through Amboy saw a steady growth of business, especially at Roy's. The complex was so busy during summer vacation that Burris placed classified ads in other states to bring in employees. Roy's Motel and Caf√© Buster sold the town in 1995, and moved to Twentynine Palms where he died in 2000. The town was owned by investors Walt Wilson and Tim White who mainly used it for photo shots and to host movie companies. After the two lost it in foreclosure, it was repossessed by Bessie Burris, Buster's widow. Bessie sold the property in February 2005 to Albert Okura, owner of the Juan Pollo restaurant chain, who offered $425,000 in cash and promised to preserve the town and reopen Roy's. The deal included about 490 acres, including the town as well as Amboy and Route 66 landmark Roy's Motel and Caf√©, the church, post office, three gas pumps, two dirt airstrips and other buildings in the town. Okura also plans to open a museum, much like he has with the original McDonald's location in San Bernardino, turning it into an unofficial museum. Okura reportedly got the idea of buying a town from the real estate agent who sold him his first home, who shared that he regretted not buying a town when he had the opportunity and recounts the story in his book, Albert Okura: The Chicken Man with a 50 Year Plan. Unlike Timothy White and Walt Wilson, who bought (and later defaulted on) the town and Roy's Motel and Cafe prior to Okura's purchase and marketed the town as a ghost-town location for film and television productions, Okura plans on restoring the town for Route 66 tourists and sees the purchase of the town as part of his \\"destiny\\". On April 28, 2008, Roy's reopened. The renovations and repairs cost $100,000. Albert Okura also planned to open a caf√© and mini-mart at the same location;Roys Gas Station Reopens-The Guzzler Blogspot Retrieved on 2010-1-12 as of 2014, the restaurant remains closed for lack of an adequate potable water supply. As of 2015 the motel is closed as well. A gift shop is open in the caf√©, and gas is available on request. The motel has been used as a stage for art exhibits. Roy's has attracted some well-known regulars. Actors Harrison Ford and Anthony Hopkins have autographed photos on the walls of the restaurant and visit whenever their schedules allow.

This type of alert is generally regarded as having been named in memory of Adam Walsh, the 6-year-old son of John Walsh (the host of Fox's America's Most Wanted). Adam was abducted from a Sears department store in Hollywood, Florida in 1981. A search was undertaken by Adam's mother, grandmother, and store employees, and public address calls were made for him every 10 to 15 minutes. After approximately 90 minutes of fruitless searching, local law enforcement was called. Sixteen days later, Adam's severed head was found; his body was never recovered. Today, many department stores, retail shops, shopping malls, supermarkets, amusement parks, hospitals, and museums participate in the Code Adam program. Legislation enacted by Congress in 2003 now mandates that all federal office buildings and PXs on military bases adopt the program. Walmart, along with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) and the departments of several state Attorneys General, has offered to assist in training workshops in order for other companies to implement the program. Process Companies that do implement the program generally place a Code Adam decal at the front of the business. Employees at these businesses are trained to take the following six steps, according to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children: # If a visitor reports a child is missing, a detailed description of the child and what they are wearing is obtained. Specifically, what color and type of shoes the child is wearing; due to how in department stores and other stores selling clothing in particular, it is easier to change a child's clothes but far harder to find different shoes. Additionally, all exterior access to the building is locked and monitored; anyone approaching a door is turned away. The child's name is not requested and is to be ignored if provided. # The employee goes to the nearest in-house telephone and pages Code Adam, describing the child's physical features and clothing. As designated employees monitor front entrances, other employees begin looking for the child. # If the child is not found within 10 minutes, law enforcement is called. # If the child is found and appears to have been lost and unharmed, the child is reunited with the searching family member. # If the child is found accompanied by someone other than a parent or legal guardian, reasonable efforts to delay their departure will be used without putting the child, staff, or visitors at risk. Law enforcement will be notified and given details about the person accompanying the child. # The Code Adam page will be canceled after the child is found or law enforcement arrives.

This happened whilst the train was still moving fast. In railway signalling, a token is a physical object which a train driver is required to have or see before entering onto a particular section of single track. The token is clearly endorsed with the names of the section it belongs to. A token system is more commonly used for single lines because of the greater risk of collision in the event of a mistake being made by a signaller or traincrew, than on double lines.  Principle  Examples of single line tokens: Tablet on left, key token on right The operation of a bidirectional single track line has obvious dangers, the most serious of which is the possibility of two trains colliding from opposite directions. The simplest method of controlling such a line is to have only one train operational, on the basis that a single train cannot collide with itself. Such a system is known as \\"one-train working\\". This system is used on some branches of rail networks, and on heritage railways. The main disadvantage is that it restricts the number of train movements that can be made. For a larger railway system, it becomes exceptionally limiting in the level of operations that it allows, with the increased risk of mistakes being made, possibly leading to a collision. Instead, reliance is placed not on employing only one train but on having a single physical object available for the single track section, and ruling that a driver may enter the single line section only if in physical possession of that object. That object is known as a token, and is marked to indicate to which single track section it belongs.  Forms of token  Tokens have existed in a variety of physical forms: * staff * tablet * ball * key  Token systems   Token only  The token system was developed in Britain in the 19th century, to enable safe working of single-line railways. If a branch line is a dead end with a simple shuttle train service, then a single token is sufficient. The driver of any train entering the branch line (or occupying any part of it) must be in possession of the token, and no collision with another train is possible. One Train Only token used by Indian Railways For convenience in passing it from hand to hand, the token was often in the form of a staff, typically long and diameter, and is referred to as a train staff. Such a staff is usually literally a wooden staff with a brass plate stating the two signal boxes between which it is valid. In UK terminology, this method of working on simple branch lines was originally referred to as One Engine in Steam (OES), and later One-Train Working (OTW). However the system was used on long through lines as well; R H Dutton, Chairman of the London and South Western Railway explained in 1876 the slow journey time between Exeter and Plymouth by saying, \\"the cause of the delay is the stopping at every station on the staff system. That really does cause a great delay because if the staff is not there, the train must stop while a man is sent on a horse to get it [from the other end of the section]\\"; quoted in Williams.Williams, R A; The London & South Western Railway, volume 2; David & Charles, Newton Abbot; 1973;  Staff and ticket  Using only a single token does not provide convenient operation when consecutive trains are to be worked in the same direction. The simple token system was therefore extended: if one train was to be followed by another in the same direction, the driver of the first train was required to be shown the token, but not take possession of it (in theory he was supposed to physically touch the token, but this was not strictly followed). The driver was given a written authority to enter the single line section, referred to as the ticket. they could then proceed, and a second train could follow. In the earliest days the second train could proceed after a designated time interval, as on double lines at the time. However, following the Armagh rail disaster of 1889, block working became mandatory. Seeing the train staff provided assurance that there could be no head-on collision. To ensure that the ticket is not issued incorrectly, a book of numbered tickets is kept in a locked box, the key to which is permanently fastened to the token, or is the token. In addition, the lock prevents the token being removed until the ticket box is closed, and it cannot be closed unless the book of tickets is in the box. Once a ticket is issued, its number is recorded in a Train Register book, and the token is locked in a secure place. This system is known as staff and ticket. In a variation on this principle, called divisible train staff, a section of the token referred to as the ticket portion was designed to be removed and handed to the driver instead of a paper ticket.  Electric token  Electric staff instruments manufactured by Webb and Thompson Neale's token instrument manufactured by Westinghouse Brake & Signal Co. The staff and ticket system was still too inflexible for busy lines, as it did not allow for the situation where the train intended to carry the actual token was cancelled or running very late. To provide for this, the electric train token system was developed. Each single-line section is provided with a pair of token instruments, one at the signal box at each end. A supply of identical tokens is stored in the instruments, which are connected by telegraph lines. A token can be removed from one instrument only if both signalmen co-operate in agreeing to the release. Once a token has been removed, another cannot be removed until the token which is \\"out\\" is replaced in either instrument. (There are variations on this sequence of events.) By this means, it can be ensured that at any one time, only one token is available to be issued to a driver. Tokens belonging to adjacent sections have different configurations to prevent them being inserted into the wrong instrument. Nevertheless, in the Abermule train collision in 1921, lax working procedures allowed the safeguards provided by the electric token system to be circumvented; a driver was handed a token for the wrong section, and proceeded on the mistaken belief that the token was correct. To try to prevent this, the UK Board of Trade Railway Inspectorate recommended that the signals controlling entry to the single line section (starting or section signals) were locked at danger unless a token had been released from the relevant token instrument.UK Board of Trade Accident Report, Abermule, 8 April 1921 This was not universally adopted and many single line sections continued without such safeguards well into the 1960s.  Collection of the token  In a basic railway situation, the token can be collected personally by the driver at the start of their work on a branch line, and surrendered by them at the end of their work there. Where the single line section is part of a through route, then it is likely that each passing train would require to surrender and collect a token at each token station. Where the trains stop at every station this is a convenient arrangement, but where some trains run through without requiring to make a call (i.e. express trains), it was necessary for the signalman to exchange tokens with the fireman (in the case of steam trains) as the train passed at slow speed. In the case of driver-only operated trains, a dead-mans hold over button was provided, so the driver could exchange the token without the emergency brake being applied. A large staff could be handed over without any special apparatus, but if the system in use employed miniature staffs, tablets or key tokens, these were usually placed in a leather pouch attached to a hoop, and the fireman could put their arm through the hoop held up by the signalman, and vice versa as the locomotive ran past. In UK practice the permitted speed for this was in daylight, but there are stories of drivers anxious to make up lost time when running late, and passing the exchange point at much higher speeds; bruised upper arms were common among signalmen and firemen on such lines. Fixed token exchange apparatus was used on some railways. Trackside equipment was fitted near each signal box to hold the pouch containing the token and to receive the token pouch that was being given up.Staff Exchangers in New South Wales Australian Railway History, August, 2004 pp318-319  Automatic exchange  Certain railways developed mechanical systems that enabled faster handover, using catcher devices that could be extended from the locomotive cabside just before the train passed the exchange point and which automatically retracted clear after the actual exchange. These enabled handover speeds of ; examples of such systems include the Whitaker system on the Somerset & Dorset Joint Railway, and the Manson system on the Great North of Scotland Railway. When the Aberdeen to Inverness passenger service was converted to diesel multiple unit operation in the late 1950s, the train-borne equipment was fixed adjacent to the train guard's compartment, and he was responsible for managing the mechanical handover; a special buzzer code enabled him to confirm to the driver that the correct token had been successfully received. Mechanical staff exchangers were also used where trains did not stop on the single line sections of the Main South, Main North and North Coast lines of the New South Wales Government Railways in Australia. On the Victorian Railways automatic staff exchangers survived on the North Eastern, Western, and Geelong-Ballarat lines till as recently as the late 1980s. On the South Australian Railways, auto staff exchangers were used on the former broad-gauge line between Adelaide and Port Pirie. In all these Australian states both steam and later diesel electric locomotives were fitted with auto exchangers. In New Zealand the New Zealand Railways (with most lines single track) used several systems; the Winter‚Äôs block system, Sykes‚Äô lock and block working; and on the North Island Main Trunk and on other lines e.g. the Wairarapa Line the Tyer‚Äôs Electric Train Tablet with the No 7 instrument, for which tablet exchangers were developed by Wynne (after trials of the Australian design by Quirke). The tablet system allowed for banking engines used for steep sections with a separate bank engine key.  Electronic token systems  Developments in electronic systems have led to the development of electronic token systems. Trains are able to run over consecutive single-track sections, with the operation being controlled by radio from a central control room. Every train carries an electronic unit that receives and sends an encrypted block of data which represents the token. The system is designed so that the control centre cannot issue a new token for a section of line until the current one is 'returned'. Trains cannot send tokens to each other. This system allows the whole line to operate without any additional signalling personnel, and has functioned without major incident. The Ternkey System  essentially a hybrid between conventional token working and internet technology - is in use on the Isle of Man Steam Railway between Castletown and Port Erin.  Variations   Intermediate block posts  In certain circumstances it was convenient to shorten the single line sections by providing an intermediate signal box equipped with token instruments without providing a passing loop there. This was done if there was, for example, an important siding connection at the intermediate location. It also enabled following through trains to run at closer headways, but did not facilitate opposing movements. Because of the greater risk of collision in the event of irregular working, the practice was deprecated in the UK, although some examples did exist for example at Beddington Lane on the Wimbledon - West Croydon line before resignalling. Usually in such cases special interlocking was provided between the two instruments at the intermediate signal box to ensure that trains could not be accepted from opposing directions at the same time. A disaster at such an intermediate location occurred on the Somerset & Dorset Joint Railway at Foxcote, near Radstock, in the Foxcote collision of 1876. This occurred before the S&DJR; was equipped for token working and was relying on block instruments only - a catalogue of errors led to two passenger trains entering the same section from opposite ends.  Long section working  In double line working, at times when traffic is light it is convenient to \\"switch out\\" an intermediate signal box, allowing the signal boxes on either side to communicate directly for train control. On single lines this is more complicated because of the train tokens being identified with single line sections, but the difficulty can be overcome by some form of long section working.https://www.signalbox.org/block/absolute10.htm A simple system used separable train staffs which fit together when intermediate block posts are closed, so that a driver receives the train staff for two or more consecutive sections from the first signalman. An alternative system employs special long- section token systems; when long section working is to be instituted, all the short section tokens must be in their respective instruments; by switching to the long-section method, tokens for the long section can then be obtained in the ordinary way. Obviously all the long-section tokens must be restored before the normal working can be resumed.  Unattended operation  Token instruments can be arranged for unattended operation, when they are operated by the train crew at intermediate crossing loops or at the terminus of the line. This system is widely found in Australia, where traffic density on many lines is low. In the UK it is known as the \\"No-signalman key token system\\". Examples on the UK national network are the North Devon Line, where the system was brought into use on 1 December 1987, the Heart of Wales Line (commissioned in 1986NSTR Signalling http://www.railsigns.co.uk; retrieved 2009-03-04 ), the Matlock branch in Derbyshire and the Liskeard to Looe line in Cornwall. On the latter, the train guard not only operates the Tyer's No.9 electric token instrument controlling the upper section of the branch, but operates the points as well. The lower section is operated on the \\"One Engine in Steam\\" principle with a simple wooden staff. Possession of the staff is required to unlock the ground frame controlling the points at Coombe Junction, where the two sections meet. There is no other signalling on the branch except to control entry and exit to and from the main line.  Token interlinking  After early experience with token systems, it became customary for the starting signal at token stations to be interlinked with the token instrument; on withdrawal of a token, the starting signal lever was released for one pull. Sometimes an intermediate siding is provided on the single line section, and the token itself, or a key fixed to the end of it, unlocks the points for shunting there. The token is locked in the apparatus there, and the driver cannot retrieve the token until the points have been set to the through running position and locked again. In special situations where the sidings at the intermediate location are extensive, the equipment is arranged for the shunting train to be put wholly inside the sidings, clear of the main line; in this situation an intermediate token instrument can be provided, enabling the driver to surrender the token so that normal through working can take place on the single line while their train is at the sidings. A corresponding arrangement sometimes applied where permanent way maintenance was carried out by motorised trolley. Usually this used special \\"occupation key\\" instruments which were interlocked with the normal token instruments and provided at intermediate places where the trolley might be off-tracked (or stored overnight).  Working by pilotman  A variation of the token system is working by pilotman, where the place of the token is taken by a person who is designated the pilotman. This system is instituted if there is a failure of the token apparatus, a signal failure within a single line section, or on double lines when one line is blocked and traffic is to be worked in both directions over the remaining line. The pilotman (identified by a red armband with \\"PILOTMAN\\" in white letters) rides in the cab with the driver, or if another train is due to follow, the pilotman must issue the driver with a single line working ticket and authorise him to enter the section. The signalman must not clear the starting signal until instructed by the pilotman to do so. The pilotman must ride with the driver if it is the last train to run in that direction. Thus pilotman working is analogous to the \\"staff and ticket\\" system, described above, where the pilotman himself becomes the token and his verbal instruction is the equivalent of the ticket. It is sometimes necessary to provide the pilotman with a personal locomotive to cater for disruptions to the service. In such a case the pilotman's locomotive is usually coupled to the front of the actual train, but practice may vary depending on local track layout, types of trains etc. The use of a pilotman for such purposes pre-dates the use of tokens.  Present-day use  Until the late 20th century, the token system was standard on British single-track lines and it still remains on a number of lines there as well as elsewhere, such as the line between and Stranraer in south west Scotland. Traditional token systems are also in use on heritage railways in Britain, for example on the Mid Hants Railway and the West Somerset Railway which is fitted throughout with Tyer's electric token instruments. The Bluebell Railway has short section token working between adjacent boxes and long section working available between Sheffield Park and Kingscote. The token system was in use on the Hurstbridge railway line, Melbourne, Australia between Greensborough and Eltham (Miniature Electric Staff) and Eltham and Hurstbridge (Train Staff and Ticket) until replaced by electronic signalling in early 2013. The Greensborough to Eltham section was abolished on 31 January 2013, along with half of the Eltham to Hurstbridge section, as far as Diamond Creek. The final Diamond Creek to Hurstbridge section was abolished on 22 March 2013. The Puffing Billy Railway in Melbourne, Victoria, has used a staff and ticket system since it was originally opened from Upper Ferntree Gully to Gembrook. The current line from Belgrave to Gembrook has permanent staff stations at Belgrave, Menzies Creek, Lakeside and Gembrook. A temporary staff station exists at Emerald town to allow trains to pass at Emerald on busy days. For the Emerald temporary staff to be activated, the Menzies Creek to Lakeside staff is required to be locked away at Menzies Creek. A similar situation occurs with Cockatoo station, whereby for it to be enacted as a Temporary Staff Station, the Lakeside to Gembrook staff is required to be locked away at Lakeside. The token method of working is sometimes still used for temporary situations such as through engineering works or where the signalling system has yet to be provided. In December 1981, a new underground line was opened in Melbourne, Australia which provided a circular service around the city's central business district. Although normal services were not to begin for some time, for two months special services operated on Sundays to allow people to try the new line, and for this period the line operated with a train staff, although there was no provision for tickets to be used. A very unusual token working was instituted on the line between Pakenham and Traralgon in Victoria, Australia for several months in 2006 whilst the line was being upgraded. During this period, the line was closed during the day, but opened each night to allow a few goods trains through. The line is double track between Pakenham and Moe (except for a short single track section). Three staffs were provided for the 100 km length, one each for the sections Pakenham--Warragul, Warragul --Moe, and Moe--Traralgon. The first two of these are partly or totally double-track sections, but the staffs in this case were applicable to both tracks, the effect being that only one of the tracks could be used at a time. The token system is still regularly used on the present-day State Railway of Thailand system. Although most use occurs in regional areas, some use appears in the capital city, Bangkok, such as the Makkasan to Khlong Tan section etc.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5mvSgTFutA&feature;=plpp Sri Lanka Railways uses a tablet exchanging system on the up-country railway line.

One day in 1958 while observing athletes running on the track with a friend, Davis, who had never run before, nor attended schools in his youth with sports programs other than basketball and football, decided that he could beat the athletes he saw on the track. He approached track coach Bill Bowerman, who would later become the founding father of the Nike, Inc., and asked to join the track team. Bowerman, who needed high jumpers, had Davis try his hand at that event. Among Davis' first attempts at the high jump, he jumped 6-0. Recalls Davis, \\"I had no form. I had no style. I just jumped.\\" He also hit 23-0 in the long jump with little effort, though Davis was flustered by the sprinting events, relating \\"I didn't even know how to get in the starting blocks\\". In his first competitive event, Bowerman entered Davis in the 220-yard dash and the 440-yard dash in the Pacific Coast Conference championships, both of which Davis won, missing the school record by two tenths of a second in the latter event. According to Davis, Bowerman made the first pair of Nike shoes for him, contradicting the claim that they were made for Phil Knight. Says Davis, \\"I told Tom Brokaw that I was the first. I don't care what all the billionaires say. Bill Bowerman made the first pair of shoes for me. People don't believe me. In fact, I didn't like the way they felt on my feet.

Legal translation may also imply that it is a specific type of translation only used in law, which is not always the case. As law is a culture-dependent subject field, legal translation is not necessarily linguistically transparent. Intransparency in translation can be avoided somewhat by use of Latin legal terminology, where possible, but in non-western languages debates are centered on the origins and precedents of specific terms, such as in the use of particular Chinese characters in Japanese legal discussions.Mizuno, Makiko (2018). Linguistic Study of Court Interpreting in Lay Judge Trials in Japan. In David G. Hebert (Ed.), International Perspectives on Translation, Education and Innovation in Japanese and Korean Societies. Cham: Springer, p.207-222. Intransparency can lead to expensive misunderstandings in terms of a contract, for example, resulting in avoidable lawsuits. Legal translation is thus usually done by specialized law translators. Conflicts over the legal impact of a translation can be avoided by indicating that the text is \\"authentic\\" i.e. legally operative on its own terms or instead is merely a \\"convenience translation\\", which itself is not legally operative. Courts only apply authentic texts and do not rely on \\"convenience\\" translations in adjudicating rights and duties of litigants.  Source text and target text  Most legal writing is exact and technical, seeking to precisely define legally binding rights and duties. Thus, precise correspondence of these rights and duties in the source text and in the translation is essential. As well as understanding and precisely translating the legal rights and duties established in the translated text, legal translators must also bear in mind the legal system of the source text (ST) and the legal system of the target text (TT) which may differ greatly from each other. This is a challenge because it requires that the translator have substantial legal knowledge as well as the multiple legal systems that can exist in one language. Examples of different legal systems include Anglo- American common law, Islamic law, or customary tribal law for examples. Apart from terminological lacunae (lexical gaps), textual conventions in the source language are often culture-dependent and may not correspond to conventions in the target culture (see e.g. Nielsen 2010). Linguistic structures that are often found in the source language may have no direct equivalent structures in the target language. The translator therefore has to be guided by certain standards of linguistic, social and cultural equivalence between the language used in the source text (ST) to produce a text (TT) in the target language. Those standards correspond to a variety of different principles defined as different approaches to translation in translation theory. Each of the standards sets a certain priority among the elements of ST to be preserved in TT. For example, following the functional approach, translators try to find target language structures with the same functions as those in the source language thus value the functionality of a text fragment in ST more than, say, the meanings of specific words in ST and the order in which they appear there.  Translation issues  The usage of transcription in the context of linguistic discussions has been controversial. Typically, two kinds of linguistic records are considered to be scientifically relevant. First, linguistic records of general acoustic features, and secondly, records that only focuses on the distinctive phonemes of a language. While transcriptions are not entirely illegitimate, transcriptions without enough detailed commentary regarding any linguistic features used has a great chance of the content being misinterpreted. An example that highlights this complication with transcription is displaying dialect in writing. The fundamental problem with this situation is that the transcribed product is not simply a spoken language in its written form, but a language the transcriber is responsible for writing down and a language that has been transcribed by someone other than the speaker, no matter the level of understanding the transcriber has for the spoken language. It is important to note that any transcription is an interpretation of the speech no matter how detailed it is, and will be selective in what it includes or leave out. Because of this reason, it is important to strategically choose the form of transcription in order to properly represent the spoken language in a written form. Different approaches to translation should not be confused with different approaches to translation theory. The former are the standards used by translators in their trade while the latter are just different paradigms used in developing translation theory. Few jurists are familiar with terms of translation theory. They may ask interpreters and translators to provide verbatim translation. They often view this term as a clear standard of quality that they desire in TT. However, verbatim translation usually is undesirable due to different grammar structures as well as different legal terms or rules in different legal systems. When it comes to translating, it can be difficult to find the correct words to translate the same information given because not all words that are translated can have the same meaning. There are many cultures around the world that the legal translation has to be exact. It is important that Legal Translators be able to interpret one word from a given language to another while still being able to maintain the same impact and meaning of the legal word.  Bilingual law dictionaries  Legal translators often consult specialized bilingual or polyglot law dictionaries. Care should be taken, as some bilingual law dictionaries are of poor quality and their use may lead to mistranslation. Bilingual legal dictionaries tend to largely be a source of reference for interpretation, rather than a source of literal equivalent translations of legal terminology. Translating legal text from one language to another becomes a challenge for legal experts because there is a level of freedom to translating texts that retain meaning and not necessarily maintaining equivalent semantic structure. There is also a debate between experts to either restrict the legal language to the target text for professional use or to broaden legal language for the use and comprehension of the public, specifically in societies with bilingual law system.

She has lived in different places in Europe, the United States and Japan. Since the mid-nineties, she has mostly lived abroad ‚àí first in Paris, now in Berlin.  Career  At the beginning of her writing career, until the 1980s, she published poems and short stories, thus becoming rather well known in her country. In 1995, she received the Icelandic National Prize for Literature for her novel Hjartasta√∞ur (Heart Place). In this novel, the author describes the difficult relationship between a mother living alone with her teenage daughter and the young girl. The text is integrating some elements of a road movie, because the protagonists are on a journey through Iceland from Reykjav√≠k to the east coast. At the same time, a gang of drug dealers, friends of the daughter, are in hot pursuit. This sounds a bit like a crime novel, but the author is more interested in the psychology of the relationship and in descriptions of Iceland's south and its nature, for example a sandstorm. Her first novel T√≠ma√æj√≥furinn (The Thief of Time, 1986) was also a big success. In this novel, the love between two teachers is in the center of the story. The woman is rather experienced and living in the High Society because of her family background, whereas her younger colleague is married and more concentrated on his work than she. The style of the novel is interesting: Poems are integrated in the text. In 1998, the novel was turned into a film in France under the title Stolen Life directed by Yves Angelo.

The cape is in Nordkapp Municipality in Troms og Finnmark county, Norway. The European route E69 highway has its northern terminus at North Cape, which makes it the northernmost point in Europe that can be accessed by car and makes the E69 the northernmost public road in Europe. The plateau is a popular tourist attraction. The cape includes a with a large flat plateau on top, where visitors, weather permitting, can watch the midnight sun and views of the Barents Sea to the north. North Cape Hall, a visitor centre, was built in 1988 on the plateau. It includes a caf√©, restaurant, post office, souvenir shop, a small museum, and video cinema. Geography Nordkapp latitude The steep cliff of the North Cape is located at , about from the North Pole. Nordkapp is often inaccurately referred to as the northernmost point of Europe. However, the neighbouring Knivskjellodden Cape actually extends further north. Furthermore, both of these points are situated on an island (Mager√∏ya), albeit one connected by road to the mainland. The northernmost point of mainland Europe is located at Cape Nordkinn () which lies about further south and about to the east. That point is located near the village of Mehamn on the Nordkinn Peninsula. The northernmost point of Europe including islands is hundreds of kilometres further north, either in Russia's Franz Josef Land or Norway's Svalbard archipelago, depending on whether Franz Josef Land is considered to be in Europe or in Asia. The North Cape is the point where the Norwegian Sea, part of the Atlantic Ocean, meets the Barents Sea, part of the Arctic Ocean. The midnight sun can be seen from 14 May to 31 July. The sun reaches its lowest point between 12:14 am and 12:24 am (00:14 and 00:24) during those days. Gripsholm at Nordkapp Transport The North Cape is reached by European route E69 highway through the North Cape Tunnel, an undersea tunnel connecting the island of Mager√∏ya to the mainland. The EuroVelo bicycle routes EV1, EV7 and EV11 connect the North Cape to Sagres, Portugal, Malta and Athens, respectively. Several cruise ships visit North Cape every year. Honningsv√•g is one of the main stops of the Hurtigruten coastal ships. Regular buses run from the nearby town of Honningsv√•g to the North Cape (), and coaches meet the many cruise ships that call at the port of Honningsv√•g.

The road to North Cape is kept open during winter and is accessible to regular vehicles and drivers that both can cope with the hard snow and wind conditions that may occur in winter. Before this, E69 was the only winter-closed E-route in Europe. History Contemporary map of the Battle of North Cape The North Cape was named by the Englishman Steven Borough, captain of the Edward Bonaventure, which sailed past in 1553 in search of the Northeast Passage. Early tourism The North Cape became a popular tourist destination during the last decades of the nineteenth century, especially after King Oscar II's visit in 1873. Regular coastal steamer routes from Germany to Northern Norway established in this period facilitated these visits, and Thomas Cook & Son began arranging tours to the destination as early as 1875. Tourists who climbed the cape would often do so using a path equipped with wired ropes from Hornviken. They would often celebrate the visit with the writing of postcards, so-called \\"Cape cards\\", gazing at the midnight sun. Monuments and buildings A granite column was erected commemorating the visit of King Oscar II of Sweden in 1873 and the visit of German Emperor Wilhelm II (in 1891) was also marked with a memorial. In 1891‚Äì92, an octagonal wooden building was erected on top of the cape, later named \\"Stoppenbrinck's\\" (or \\"Stoppenbrink's\\") \\"Champagne Pavilion\\". World War II In 1943, the Battle of North Cape was fought in the Arctic Ocean off this cape, where the German battleship Scharnhorst was eventually sunk by gunfire from the British battleship HMS Duke of York and torpedoes from the Norwegian destroyer HNoMS Stord, and other ships of the British Navy. Road access A road to the North Cape was first built in 1956. Admission fee controversy As of 2011, an adult ticket to the North Cape visitor centre cost between . Often there is fog (since the plateau is above the common cloud base), which obscures the view. There is no discount for this situation, but the full price ticket is valid for multiple entries within 48 hours. In 2000, and again in 2011, the Norwegian Ministry of the Environment responded to pressure from interest groups and asked Nordkapps VEL, the company that maintains the site, to reduce the admission fee to the plateau. Nordkapps VEL responded that the 8,000 daily visitors and distant location places great demands on the operations, maintenance, and security of the facilities and natural features of the large site. The fee was not lowered, and has since been slightly increased although visitors arriving by foot, bicycle, or other non-motorized vehicles are nowadays offered free entrance.

The ethics of neuroscience comprises the bulk of work in neuroethics. It concerns the ethical, legal and social impact of neuroscience, including the ways in which neurotechnology can be used to predict or alter human behavior and \\"the implications of our mechanistic understanding of brain function for society... integrating neuroscientific knowledge with ethical and social thought\\". Some neuroethics problems are not fundamentally different from those encountered in bioethics. Others are unique to neuroethics because the brain, as the organ of the mind, has implications for broader philosophical problems, such as the nature of free will, moral responsibility, self-deception, and personal identity.Farah Martha J., Neuroethics: An Introduction with Readings, 2010 Examples of neuroethics topics are given later in this article (\\"Key issues in neuroethics\\"). The origin of the term \\"neuroethics\\" has occupied some writers. Rees and Rose (as cited in \\"References\\" on page 9) claim neuroethics is a neologism that emerged only at the beginning of the 21st century, largely through the oral and written communications of ethicists and philosophers. According to Racine (2010), the term was coined by the Harvard physician Anneliese A. Pontius in 1973 in a paper entitled \\"Neuro-ethics of 'walking' in the newborn\\" for the Perceptual and Motor Skills. The author reproposed the term in 1993 in her paper for Psychological Report, often wrongly mentioned as the first title containing the word \\"neuroethics\\". Before 1993, the American neurologist Ronald Cranford has used the term (see Cranford 1989). Illes (2003) records uses, from the scientific literature, from 1989 and 1991. Writer William Safire is widely credited with giving the word its current meaning in 2002, defining it as \\"the examination of what is right and wrong, good and bad about the treatment of, perfection of, or unwelcome invasion of and worrisome manipulation of the human brain\\".Safire, W.

The field is so young that any attempt to define its scope and limits now will undoubtedly be proved wrong in the future, as neuroscience develops and its implications continue to be revealed. At present, however, we can discern two general categories of neuroethical issue: those emerging from what we can do and those emerging from what we know. In the first category are the ethical problems raised by advances in functional neuroimaging, psychopharmacology, brain implants and brain-machine interfaces. In the second category are the ethical problems raised by our growing understanding of the neural bases of behavior, personality, consciousness, and states of spiritual transcendence. Historical background and implications of neuroscience ethics Primitive societies for the most part lacked a system of neuroethics to guide them in facing the problems of mental illness and violence as civilization advanced. Trepanation led through a tortuous course to \\"psychosurgery\\". Basic neuroscience research and psychosurgery advanced in the first half of the 20th century in tandem, but neuroscience ethics was left behind science and technology. Medical ethics in modern societies even in democratic governments, not to mention in authoritarian ones, has not kept pace with the advances of technology despite the announced social \\"progress\\"; and ethics continues to lag behind science in dealing with the problem of mental illness in association with human violence. Unprovoked \\"pathological\\" aggression persists, reminding us daily that civilization is a step away from relapsing into barbarism. Neuroscience ethics (neuroethics) must keep up with advances in neuroscience research and remain separate from state-imposed mandates to face this challenge. A recent writer on the history of psychosurgery as it relates to neuroethics concludes: \\"The lessons of history sagaciously reveal wherever the government has sought to alter medical ethics and enforce bureaucratic bioethics, the results have frequently vilified medical care and research. In the 20th century in both the communist USSR and Nazi Germany, medicine regressed after these authoritarian systems corrupted the ethics of the medical profession and forced it to descend to unprecedented barbarism. The Soviet psychiatrists and Nazi doctor's dark descent into barbarism was a product of physicians willingly cooperating with the totalitarian state, purportedly in the name of the \\"collective good\\", at the expense of their individual patients.\\" This must be kept in mind when establishing new guidelines in neuroscience research and bioethics. Important activity since 2002  There is no doubt that people were thinking and writing about the ethical implications of neuroscience for many years before the field adopted the label \\"neuroethics\\", and some of this work remains of great relevance and value. However, the early 21st century saw a tremendous surge in interest concerning the ethics of neuroscience, as evidenced by numerous meetings, publications and organizations dedicated to this topic. In 2002, there were several meetings that drew together neuroscientists and ethicists to discuss neuroethics: the American Association for the Advancement of Science with the journal Neuron, the University of Pennsylvania, the Royal Society, Stanford University, and the Dana Foundation. This last meeting was the largest, and resulted in a book, Neuroethics: Mapping the Field, edited by Steven J. Marcus and published by Dana Press. That same year, the Economist ran a cover story entitled \\"Open Your Mind: The Ethics of Brain Science\\", Nature published the article \\"Emerging ethical issues in neuroscience\\". Further articles appeared on neuroethics in Nature Neuroscience, Neuron, and Brain and Cognition. Thereafter, the number of neuroethics meetings, symposia and publications continued to grow. The over 38 000 members of the Society for Neuroscience recognized the importance of neuroethics by inaugurating an annual \\"special lecture\\" on the topic, first given by Donald Kennedy, editor-in-chief of Science Magazine. Several overlapping networks of scientists and scholars began to coalesce around neuroethics-related projects and themes. For example, the American Society for Bioethics and Humanities established a Neuroethics Affinity Group, students at the London School of Economics established the Neuroscience and Society Network linking scholars from several different institutions, and a group of scientists and funders from around the world began discussing ways to support international collaboration in neuroethics through what came to be called the International Neuroethics Network. Stanford began publishing the monthly Stanford Neuroethics Newsletter, Penn developed the informational website neuroethics.upenn.edu, and the Neuroethics and Law Blog was launched. Several relevant books were published during this time as well: Sandra Ackerman's Hard Science, Hard Choices: Facts, Ethics and Policies Guiding Brain Science Today (Dana Press), Michael Gazzaniga's The Ethical Brain (Dana Press), Judy Illes' edited volume, Neuroethics: Defining the Issues in Theory, Practice and Policy (both Oxford University Press), Dai Rees and Steven Rose's edited volume The New Brain Sciences: Perils and Prospects (Cambridge University Press) and Steven Rose's The Future of the Brain (Oxford University Press). 2006 marked the founding of the International Neuroethics Society (INS) (originally the Neuroethics Society), an international group of scholars, scientists, clinicians, and other professionals who share an interest in the social, legal, ethical and policy implications of advances in neuroscience. The mission of the International Neuroethics Society \\"is to promote the development and responsible application of neuroscience through interdisciplinary and international research, education, outreach and public engagement for the benefit of people of all nations, ethnicities, and cultures\\". The first President of the INS was Steven Hyman (2006‚Äì2014), succeeded by Barbara Sahakian (2014‚Äì2016). Judy Illes is the current President, who like Hyman and Sahakian, was also a pioneer in the field of neuroethics and a founder member of the INS. Over the next several years many centers for neurotics were established. A 2014 review of the field lists 31 centers and programs around the world; some of the longest running include the Neuroethics Research Unit at the Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal (IRCM), the National Core for Neuroethics at the University of British Columbia in 2007, the Center for Neurotechnology Studies of the Potomac Institute for Policy Studies, the Wellcome Centre for Neuroethics at the University of Oxford; and the Center for Neuroscience & Society at the University of Pennsylvania. Since 2017, neuroethics working groups across multiple organizations have published a spate of reports and guiding principles. In 2017, the Global Neuroethics Summit Delegates prepared a set of ethical questions to guide research in brain science, published in Neuron. In December 2018, The Neuroethics Working Group of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative proposed incorporating Neuroethics Guiding Principles into the research advanced by the Initiative. In December 2019, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) confirmed a set of neuroethics principles and recommendations; now this interdisciplinary group is developing a toolkit for implementation, moving from the theoretical to the practical.https://www.oecd.org/science/recommendation-on-responsible- innovation-in-neurotechnology.htm In early 2020, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) developed a neuroethical framework to facilitate the development of guidelines for engineers working on new neurotechnologies.https://standards.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee- standards/standards/web/documents/presentations/ieee-neurotech-for-bmi- standards-roadmap.pdf Sources of information The books, articles and websites mentioned above are by no means a complete list of good neuroethics information sources. For example, readings and websites that focus on specific aspects of neuroethics, such as brain imaging or enhancement, are not included. Nor are more recent sources, such as Walter Glannon's book Bioethics and the Brain (Oxford University Press) and his reader, entitled Defining Right and Wrong in Brain Science (Dana Press). We should also here mention a book that was in many ways ahead of its time, Robert Blank's Brain Policy (published in 1999 by Georgetown University Press). The scholarly literature on neuroethics has grown so quickly that one cannot easily list all of the worthwhile articles, and several journals are now soliciting neuroethics submissions for publication, including the American Journal of Bioethics ‚Äì Neuroscience, BioSocieties, the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, and Neuroethics. The web now has many sites, blogs and portals offering information about neuroethics. A list can be found at the end of this entry. Key issues Neuroethics encompasses a wide range of issues, which can only be sampled here. Some have close ties to traditional biomedical ethics, in that different versions of these issues can arise in connection with organ systems other than the brain. For example, how should incidental findings be handled when a presumed healthy research subject is scanned for neuroscience research and the scan reveals an abnormality? How safe are the drugs used to enhance normal brain function? These are neuroethical issues with clear precedents in traditional bioethics. They are important issues, and luckily we can call upon society's experience with the relevant precedents to help determine the best courses of action in the present cases. In contrast, many neuroethical issues are at least partly novel, and this accounts for some of the intellectual fascination of neuroethics. These relatively newer issues force us to think about the relation between mind and brain and its ethical implications. Brain interventions The ethics of neurocognitive enhancement, that is the use of drugs and other brain interventions to make normal people \\"better than well\\", is an example of a neuroethical issue with both familiar and novel aspects. On the one hand, we can be informed by previous bioethical work on physical enhancements such as doping for strength in sports and the use of human growth hormone for normal boys of short stature. On the other hand, there are also some arguably novel ethical issues that arise in connection with brain enhancement, because these enhancements affect how people think and feel, thus raising the relatively new issues of \\"cognitive liberty\\". The growing role of psychopharmacology in everyday life raises a number of ethical issues, for example the influence of drug marketing on our conceptions of mental health and normalcy, and the increasingly malleable sense of personal identity that results from what Peter D. Kramer called \\"cosmetic psychopharmacology\\". Nonpharmacologic methods of altering brain function are currently enjoying a period of rapid development, with a resurgence of psychosurgery for the treatment of medication refractory mental illnesses and promising new therapies for neurological and psychiatric illnesses based on deep brain stimulation as well as relatively noninvasive transcranial stimulation methods. Research on brain-machine interfaces is primarily in a preclinical phase but promises to enable thought-based control of computers and robots by paralyzed patients. As the tragic history of frontal lobotomy reminds us, permanent alteration of the brain cannot be undertaken lightly. Although nonpharmacologic brain interventions are exclusively aimed at therapeutic goals, the US military sponsors research in this general area (and more specifically in the use of transcranial direct current stimulation) that is presumably aimed at enhancing the capabilities of soldiers. Brain imaging In addition to the important issues of safety and incidental findings, mentioned above, some arise from the unprecedented and rapidly developing ability to correlate brain activation with psychological states and traits. One of the most widely discussed new applications of imaging is based on correlations between brain activity and intentional deception. Intentional deception can be thought of in the context of a lie detector. This means that scientists use brain imaging to look at certain parts of the brain during moments when a person is being deceptive. A number of different research groups have identified fMRI correlates of intentional deception in laboratory tasks, and despite the skepticism of many experts, the technique has already been commercialized. A more feasible application of brain imaging is \\"neuromarketing\\", whereby people's conscious or unconscious reaction to certain products can purportedly be measured. Researchers are also finding brain imaging correlates of myriad psychological traits, including personality, intelligence, mental health vulnerabilities, attitudes toward particular ethnic groups, and predilection for violent crime. Unconscious racial attitudes may be manifest in brain activation. These capabilities of brain imaging, actual and potential, raise a number of ethical issues. The most obvious concern involves privacy. For example, employers, marketers, and the government all have a strong interest in knowing the abilities, personality, truthfulness and other mental contents of certain people. This raises the question of whether, when, and how to ensure the privacy of our own minds. Another ethical problem is that brain scans are often viewed as more accurate and objective than in fact they are. Many layers of signal processing, statistical analysis and interpretation separate imaged brain activity from the psychological traits and states inferred from it. There is a danger that the public (including judges and juries, employers, insurers, etc.) will ignore these complexities and treat brain images as a kind of indisputable truth. A related misconception is called neuro-realism: In its simplest form, this line of thought says that something is real because it can be measured with electronic equipment. A person who claims to have pain, or low libido, or unpleasant emotions is \\"really\\" sick if these symptoms are supported by a brain scan, and healthy or normal if correlates cannot be found in a brain scan. The case of phantom limbs demonstrate the inadequacy of this approach. Memory dampening While complete memory erasure is still an element of science-fiction, certain neurological drugs have been proven to dampen the strength and emotional association of a memory. Propranolol, an FDA-approved drug, has been suggested to effectively dull the painful effects of traumatic memories if taken within 6 hours after the event occurs. This has begun the discussion of ethical implications, assuming the technology for memory erasure will only improve. Originally, propranolol was reserved for hypertension patients. However, doctors are permitted to use the drug for off- label purposes‚Äîleading to the question of whether they actually should. There are numerous reasons for skepticism; for one, it may prevent us from coming to terms with traumatic experiences, it may tamper with our identities and lead us to an artificial sense of happiness, demean the genuineness of human life, and/or encourage some to forget memories they are morally obligated to keep. Whether or not it is ethical to fully or partially erase the memory of a patient, it is certainly becoming a more relevant topic as this technology improves in our society. Stem cell therapy Most of the issues concerning uses of stem cells in the brain are the same as any of the bioethical or purely ethical questions you will find regarding the use and research of stem cells. The field of stem cell research is a very new field which poses many ethical questions concerning the allocation of stem cells as well as their possible uses. Since most stem cell research is still in its preliminary phase most of the neuroethical issues surrounding stem cells are the same as stem cell ethics in general. More specifically the way that stem cell research has been involved in neuroscience is through the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and brain tumors. In these cases scientists are using neural stem cells to regenerate tissue and to be used as carriers for gene therapy. In general, neuroethics revolves around a cost benefit approach to find techniques and technologies that are most beneficial to patients. There has been progress in certain fields that have been shown to be beneficial when using stem cells to treat certain neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. A study done in 2011 showed that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be used to aid in Parkinson's research and treatment. The cells can be used to study the progression of Parkinson's as well as used in regenerative treatment. Animal studies have shown that the use of iPSCs can improve motor skills and dopamine release of test subjects with Parkinson's. This study shows a positive outcome in the use of stem cells for neurological purposes. In another study done in 2011 used stem cells to treat cerebral palsy. This study, however, was not as successful as the Parkinson's treatment. In this case stem cells were used to treat animal models who had been injured in a way that mimicked CP. This brings up a neuroethical issue of animal models used in science. Since most of their \\"diseases\\" are inflicted and do not occur naturally, they can not always be reliable examples of how a person with the actual disease would respond to treatment. The stem cells used did survive implantation, but did not show significant nerve regeneration. However, studies are ongoing in this area. As discussed, stem cells are used to treat degenerative diseases. One form of a degenerative disease that can occur in the brain as well as throughout the body is an autoimmune disease. Autoimmune diseases cause the body to \\"attack\\" its own cells and therefore destroys those cells as well as whatever functional purpose those cells have or contribute to. One form of an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system is multiple sclerosis. In this disease the body attacks the glial cells that form myelin coats around the axons on neurons. This causes the nervous system to essentially \\"short circuit\\" and pass information very slowly. Stem cells therapy has been used to try to cure some of the damage caused by the body in MS. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been used to try and cure MS patients by essentially \\"reprogramming\\" their immune system. The main risk encountered with this form of treatment is the possibility of rejection of the stem cells. If the hematopoietic stem cells can be harvested from the individual, risk of rejection is much lower. But, there can be the risk of those cells being programmed to induce MS. However, if the tissue is donated from another individual there is high risk of rejection leading to possibly fatal toxicity in the recipient's body. Considering that there are fairly good treatments for MS, the use of stem cells in this case may have a higher cost than the benefits they produce. However, as research continues perhaps stem cells will truly become a viable treatment for MS as well as other autoimmune diseases. These are just some examples of neurological diseases in which stem cell treatment has been researched. In general, the future looks promising for stem cell application in the field of neurology. However, possible complications lie in the overall ethics of stem cell use, possible recipient rejection, as well as over- proliferation of the cells causing possible brain tumors. Ongoing research will further contribute in the decision of whether stem cells should be used in the brain and whether their benefits truly outweigh their costs. The primary ethical dilemma that is brought up in stem cell research is concerning the source of embryonic stem cells (hESCs). As the name states, hESCs come from embryos. To be more specific, they come from the inner cell mass of a blastophere, which is the beginning stage of an embryo. However, that mass of cells could have the potential to give rise to human life, and there in lies the problem. Often, this argument leads back to a similar moral debate held around abortion. The question is: when does a mass of cells gain personhood and autonomy? Some individuals believe that an embryo is in fact a person at the moment of conception and that using an embryo for anything other than creating a baby would essentially be killing a baby. On the other end of the spectrum, people argue that the small ball of cells at that point only has the potential to become a fetus, and that potentiality, even in natural conception, is far from guaranteed. According to a study done by developmental biologists, between 75‚Äì80% of embryos created through intercourse are naturally lost before they can become fetuses. This debate is not one that has a right or wrong answer, nor can it be clearly settled. Much of the ethical dilemma surrounding hESCs relies on individual beliefs about life and the potential for scientific advancement versus creating new human life.  Disorders of consciousness  Patients in coma, vegetative, or minimally conscious state pose ethical challenges. The patients are unable to respond, therefore the assessment of their needs can only be approached by adopting a third person perspective. They are unable to communicate their pain levels, quality of life, or end of life preferences. Neuroscience and brain imaging have allowed us to explore the brain activity of these patients more thoroughly. Recent findings from studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging have changed the way we view vegetative patients. The images have shown that aspects emotional processing, language comprehension and even conscious awareness might be retained in patients whose behavior suggests a vegetative state. If this is the case, it is unethical to allow a third party to dictate the life and future of the patient. For example, defining death is an issue that comes with patients with severe traumatic brain injuries. The decision to withdraw life-sustaining care from these patients can be based on uncertain assessments about the individual's conscious awareness. Case reports have shown that these patients in a persistent vegetative state can recover unexpectedly. This raises the ethical question about the premature termination of care by physicians. The hope is that one day, neuroimaging technologies can help us to define these different states of consciousness and enable us to communicate with patients in vegetative states in a way that was never before possible. The clinical translation of these advanced technologies is of vital importance for the medical management of these challenging patients. In this situation, neuroscience has both revealed ethical issues and possible solutions. Pharmacological enhancement Cosmetic neuro-pharmacology, the use of drugs to improve cognition in normal healthy individuals, is highly controversial. Some case reports with the antidepressant Prozac indicated that patients seemed \\"better than well\\", and authors hypothesized that this effect might be observed in individuals not afflicted with psychiatric disorders. Following these case reports much controversy arose over the veracity and ethics of the cosmetic use of these antidepressants. Opponents of cosmetic pharmacology believe that such drug usage is unethical and that the concept of cosmetic pharmacology is a manifestation of naive consumerism. Proponents, such as philosopher Arthur Caplan, state that it is an individual's (rather than government's, or physician's) right to determine whether to use a drug for cosmetic purposes. Anjan Chatterjee, a neurologist at the University of Pennsylvania, has argued that western medicine stands on the brink of a neuro- enhancement revolution in which people will be able to improve their memory and attention through pharmacological means. Jacob Appel, a Brown University bioethicist, has raised concerns about the possibility of employers mandating such enhancement for their workers.Jason Kirby. Going to Work on Smart Drugs. Maclean's. October 1, 2008. The ethical concerns regarding pharmacological enhancement are not limited to Europe and North America, indeed, there is increasing attention given to cultural and regulatory contexts for this phenomenon, around the globe. Politics of neuromarketing The politics of neuromarketing is this idea of using advertisements to convince the mind of a voter to vote for a certain party. This has already been happening within the elections throughout the years. In the 2006 reelection of Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, he was double digits off in the voting in comparison to his Democratic opponent. However, Schwarzenegger's theme in this campaign was whether or not the voters would want to continue Schwarzenegger's reforms or go back to the days of the recalled governor, Gray Davis. In normal marketing, voters would use \\"detail, numbers, facts and figures to prove we were better off under the new governor\\". However, with neuromarketing, voters followed powerful advertisement visuals and used these visuals to convince themselves that Schwarzenegger was the better candidate. Now, with political neuromarketing, there exists a lot of controversy. The ethics behind political neuromarketing are debatable. Some argue that political neuromarketing will cause voters to make rash decisions while others argue that these messages are beneficial because they depict what the politicians can do. However, control over political decisions could make voters not see the reality of things. Voters may not look into the details of the reforms, personality, and morality each person brings to their political campaign and may be swayed by how powerful the advertisements seem to be. However, there are also people that may disagree with this idea. Darryl Howard, \\"a consultant to two Republican winners on November 2, says he crafted neuromarketing-based messages for TV, direct mail and speeches for Senate, Congressional and Gubernatorial clients in 2010\\". He says that these advertisements that were presented, show honesty and continues to say how he and other politicians decide which advertisements are the most effective. Neurological treatments  Neuroscience has led to a deeper understanding of the chemical imbalances present in a disordered brain. In turn, this has resulted in the creation of new treatments and medications to treat these disorders. When these new treatments are first being tested, the experiments prompt ethical questions. First, because the treatment is affecting the brain, the side effects can be unique and sometimes severe. A special kind of side effect that many subjects have claimed to experience in neurological treatment tests is changes in \\"personal identity\\". Although this is a difficult ethical dilemma because there are no clear and undisputed definitions of personality, self, and identity, neurological treatments can result in patients losing parts of \\"themselves\\" such as memories or moods. Yet another ethical dispute in neurological treatment research is the choice of patients. From a perspective of justice, priority should be given to those who are most seriously impaired and who will benefit most from the intervention. However, in a test group, scientists must select patients to secure a favorable risk-benefit ratio. Setting priority becomes more difficult when a patient's chance to benefit and the seriousness of their impairment do not go together. For example, many times an older patient will be excluded despite the seriousness of their disorder simply because they are not as strong or as likely to benefit from the treatment. The main ethical issue at the heart of neurological treatment research on human subjects is promoting high-quality scientific research in the interest of future patients, while at the same time respecting and guarding the rights and interests of the research subjects. This is particularly difficult in the field of neurology because damage to the brain is often permanent and will change a patient's way of life forever. Neuroscience and free will Neuroethics also encompasses the ethical issues raised by neuroscience as it affects our understanding of the world and of ourselves in the world. For example, if everything we do is physically caused by our brains, which are in turn a product of our genes and our life experiences, how can we be held responsible for our actions? A crime in the United States requires a \\"guilty act\\" and a \\"guilty mind\\". As neuropsychiatry evaluations have become more commonly used in the criminal justice system and neuroimaging technologies have given us a more direct way of viewing brain injuries, scholars have cautioned that this could lead to the inability to hold anyone criminally responsible for their actions. In this way, neuroimaging evidence could suggest that there is no free will and each action a person makes is simply the product of past actions and biological impulses that are out of our control. The question of whether and how personal autonomy is compatible with neuroscience ethics and the responsibility of neuroscientists to society and the state is a central one for neuroethics. However, there is some controversy over whether autonomy entails the concept of 'free will' or is a 'moral-political' principle separate from metaphysical quandaries. In late 2013 U.S. President Barack Obama made recommendations to the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues as part of his $100 million Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative. This Spring discussion resumed in a recent interview and article sponsored by Agence France-Presse (AFP): \\"It is absolutely critical... to integrate ethics from the get-go into neuroscience research,\\" and not \\"for the first time after something has gone wrong\\", said Amy Gutmann, Bioethics Commission Chair.\\" But no consensus has been reached. Miguel Faria, a Professor of Neurosurgery and an Associate Editor in Chief of Surgical Neurology International, who was not involved in the Commission's work said, \\"any ethics approach must be based upon respect for the individual, as doctors pledge according to the Hippocratic Oath which includes vows to be humble, respect privacy and doing no harm; and pursuing a path based on population- based ethics is just as dangerous as having no medical ethics at all\\". Why the danger of population-based bioethics? Faria asserts, \\"it is centered on utilitarianism, monetary considerations, and the fiscal and political interests of the state, rather than committed to placing the interest of the individual patient or experimental subject above all other considerations\\". For her part, Gutmann believes the next step is \\"to examine more deeply the ethical implications of neuroscience research and its effects on society\\".

Grey succeeded his grandfather Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn in 1440. He married Lady Katherine Percy, who was also a great-granddaughter of John of Gaunt by his third wife, Katherine Swynford, and also a descendant of King Edward III of England through his second son, Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence. Knighthood Edmund Grey was knighted following service in Aquitaine in October 1440. He attended the royal council between 1456 and 1458. Active militarily in the Wars of the Roses, he especially played a decisive role in the Battle of Northampton by switching his allegiance from the Lancastrian to the Yorkist cause. For this action he was rewarded by Edward IV with a grant of the manor of Ampthill, ownership of which had come into dispute between Grey, Ralph Lord Cromwell and Henry Holland Duke of Exeter.

Following the resignation of then-chancellor Bruce Poulton in 1989, Monteith was named interim chancellor, a position that he was thereafter named to on a permanent basis. He inherited an intercollegiate sports program in turmoil that had been recently penalized by the NCAA. By the time he completed his service as chancellor, the program was stable and graduation rates of student-athletes had increased dramatically. In spite of difficult statewide budgetary conditions throughout his chancellorship, Monteith presided over a strong period of growth and advancement at NC State. The university's research campus, the Centennial Campus, grew from a single building housing the university's College of Textiles to a multi-tenant campus housing academic, corporate, and government researchers. Plans were developed then for a public golf course and executive center, as well as a new alumni building. Under Monteith's leadership, the office of the provost (chief academic officer) underwent major changes, resulting in significant new responsibilities and power. Academic honor programs were also enhanced, with the addition of a First Year College, a chapter of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society, and the Park Scholarship program, a prestigious full-expense merit scholarship, similar to the Morehead Scholarship at sister institution UNC Chapel Hill. He led the transformation of the university library, dramatically improving its ranking among research libraries from next to last place to 32nd the year he left. In addition, the College of Management was established during his tenure and NCSU also became the first Atlantic Coast Conference member to become accredited by the NCAA. On his retirement, Monteith was succeeded as chancellor of NCSU by Marye Anne Fox. The Engineering Graduate Research Center on centennial campus was renamed Monteith Research Center in his honor by the NCSU Board of Trustees. NCSU Libraries Special Collections Research Center currently houses Larry King Monteith's manuscript collection.

It is situated between a mountain range and the sea. The nearby mountain Kirkjufell forms a small peninsula. Kirkjufell, one of the most famous mountains in Iceland is the landmark of Grundarfj√∂r√∞ur and visible from all angles in town. Overview The town received the right to do commerce in 1786. Around 1800, French merchants came to Iceland and lived in Grundarfj√∂r√∞ur, where they constructed a church and a hospital of their own. The town has become rich through the fishing industry, and this wealth shows in the style of the original, luxurious houses being built. The road to nearby Stykkish√≥lmur crosses a big lava field, called Berserkjahraun. The name of the lava field comes from the Eyrbyggja saga, according to which two Berserkers were slain here by their master, because one of them fell in love with his master's daughter. Twin town * Paimpol, France. Grundarfj√∂r√∞ur and Paimpol in Brittany in northwest France have strong historical connections. Between 1852 and 1935, French sailors from Paimpol and the surrounding region sailed to Iceland to catch cod. The connection between the two towns was sealed in a formal friendship and Grundarfj√∂r√∞ur has been twinned with the French town Paimpol since 2004.https://www.grundarfjordur.is/is/eng/grundarfjordur- municipality/grundarfjordur-twin-town-paimpol Port and Fisheries The harbor is the district's lifeline. Excellent harbor facilities and favorable natural conditions have encouraged the growth of the fishing sector. Well- established fishing companies operate in Grundarfj√∂r√∞ur. They possess quotas for a variety of species, which means that fishing activity is evenly distributed throughout the year. The industry has been developed with a view to the future and today, Grundarfj√∂r√∞ur's harbor is one of the 10 largest quota-fishery harbors in the country with the biggest demersal catch in West Iceland being landed here. Tourism Nature, community life, and the area's history have attracted many tourists from both Iceland and abroad to visit Grundarfj√∂r√∞ur. Grundarfj√∂r√∞ur is the perfect place for discovering Sn√¶fellsnes as it is so centrally located. There are also a number of activities on offer from Grundarfj√∂r√∞ur such as horseback riding, kayaking, whale watching, glacier tours, birdwatching boat tours, and sea angling.

Among its alumni throughout history are forty-two college and university presidents, seven Governors and members of U.S. Congress, and the 40th President of the United States, Ronald Wilson Reagan, class of 1932. Ronald Reagan is the only president born, raised and educated in the state of Illinois. Reagan's relationship with his alma mater began in 1928 when he entered as a freshman from Dixon, Illinois, at age 17. Following his graduation on June 10, 1932, with a joint major in economics and sociology, Reagan returned for visits on twelve recorded occasions. He served on the board of trustees for three terms, stayed connected to his fraternity Tau Kappa Epsilon, communicated with his football coach and mentor Ralph \\"Mac\\" McKinzie, and helped support fund-raising drives including with his own financial commitments to the college. Reagan gave three commencement addresses at Eureka College in 1957, 1982 and 1992. He dedicated the Melick Library building in 1967 and the Reagan Physical Education Center in 1970. When he died in 2004, Eureka College was one of three officially designated recipients of memorial gifts by his family.

Kapiolani Park - Hawaii The yellow-fronted canary was formerly placed in the genus Serinus, but phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences found that genus to be polyphyletic. The genus was therefore split and a number of species including the yellow-fronted canary were moved to the resurrected genus Crithagra Swainson 1827. This bird is a resident breeder in Africa south of the Sahara Desert. Its habitat is open woodland and cultivation. It nests in trees, laying three or four eggs in a compact cup nest. It has been introduced to the Hawaiian Islands, where it is found on western Hawaii, southeastern Oahu and Molokai. The yellow-fronted canary is a common, gregarious seedeater. It is 11‚Äì13 cm in length. The adult male has a green back and brown wings and tail. The underparts and rump are yellow, and the head is yellow with a grey crown and nape and a black malar stripe.

Gameplay Title screen of the game The player initially controls Buster Bunny in the effort to rescue Babs Bunny from her kidnapper, Montana Max. Before each world, the player can select an alternate character that they can switch into if they find a star ball. The three alternate characters are Dizzy Devil, Furrball, and Plucky Duck. Dizzy, Furrball, and Plucky have unique abilities that Buster lacks: Plucky can briefly fly, Dizzy can destroy walls and most enemies with his spin mode, and Furrball can climb many vertical surfaces, slowly sliding down them rather than plunging down. However, Buster can jump higher than others. There are six worlds in the game, with three levels each: The Hills, The Wetlands, The Trees, Downtown, Wackyland (unlike the rest, this world only has one level), and Montana Max's Mansion. Aiding Buster is Hamton, who will give Buster an extra lives for 30 carrots each. The second level in each world concludes with an enclosed area where the player must avoid Elmyra and exit through the door; if the player is grabbed by Elmyra, they must start the world over. The third level in each world concludes with a boss battle. Duck Vader (a parody of Darth Vader) makes a cameo appearance as a secret boss if the number of carrots collected in any level is odd multiple of eleven.

Near Eastern archaeology is a regional branch of the wider, global discipline of archaeology. It refers generally to the excavation and study of artifacts and material culture of the Near East from antiquity to the recent past. Definition The description \\"Near Eastern\\" for this branch of archaeology is highly Eurocentric and Americocentric, reflecting the origins and growth of the field in Western academic traditions. However, in the absence of better solutions, and the continued heavy involvement of Western academics, the term has taken hold and remains in frequent use. The definition of the Near East is usually based on the Fertile Crescent; the region between the Nile Valley (modern Egypt) and Mesopotamia (modern Iraq). Also usually included are Iran, the Arabian peninsula and its islands, Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), Cyprus and North Africa west of Egypt. The history of archaeological investigation in this region grew out of the 19th century discipline of Biblical archaeology, efforts mostly by Europeans to uncover evidence for Biblical (Old and New Testaments) narratives. Much archaeological work in this region is still influenced by that discipline, although within the last three decades there has been a marked tendency by some archaeologists to dissociate their work from Biblical frameworks. Near Eastern Archaeology is a term with a wide, often generalised application, and is frequently divided into further regional sub-branches, the archaeology of modern states in the region or along broad thematic lines. Regions can be loosely defined, but are often based on recognizable entities that evidence cultural cohesion and coincide with topographical zones. Scholars may differ on the way the region is divided. Regional divisions also may change from period to period. The most common fields of study are Biblical archaeology dealing with the region and history of the Bible; Assyriology dealing with Mesopotamia; Egyptology dealing with the ancient history of what is today Egypt and parts of the Sudan; and prehistoric archaeology which is not tied to a region but instead deals with the origins of culture before the invention of writing. Geographic subdivisions Egyptology is one example of a specialized branch that deals with the Nile Valley cultures of Egypt and associated regions in sub-Saharan Africa, the Sinai Peninsula to the east, and parts of North Africa. It includes language studies, history and archaeology and their related disciplines. Nowadays, there is much work also done on the prehistoric archaeological record and its practitioners are best described as prehistorians. The name Levant (or Syria-Palestine) is used to refer to the area adjacent to the east coast of the Mediterranean. The southern region included in this term encompasses Israel, the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and part of Jordan. Palestine was its ancient Roman and Byzantine name and was also in use during the Crusades (1095‚Äì1291), the period of Ottoman rule (1517-1917) and the British Mandate (1918‚Äì1948). The same region is also called the Holy Land, the Land of Israel, and Canaan because of biblical associations. The foregoing names can be perceived as having political overtones, meaning that the more neutral, geographically based term the southern Levant has become popular with archaeologists who wish to refer to this area without prejudice or political orientation. In many contexts the Sinai Peninsula is also considered to be part of the southern Levant, although it is part of the modern state of Egypt. Archaeologically, it is distinguished from the heartland of Egypt, the Nile Valley and Delta. The term northern Levant can be used to refer to Lebanon, the Syrian littoral and portions of the Mediterranean coast of Turkey in the province of Hatay. More usually, these regions are included in greater Syria, a name used to refer to the whole area between Anatolia, Mesopotamia and Arabia. The Mediterranean coast of Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic and parts of Northern Israel are also known as Phoenicia, after the ancient kingdom. However, this term suffers from the same problems as Canaan and equivalents and so is generally now only used in a strict historical sense. The landmass of Anatolia, most of modern Turkey, is bordered by several seas and includes parts of Northern Mesopotamia. The Tigris and Euphrates rise in Turkey and flow south into Iraq. Cyprus (ancient Alashiya), a large island in the eastern Mediterranean was a separate cultural entity during most periods of human occupation. However, its proximity to both Anatolia and the northern and southern Levant was responsible for influences from and to both these regions. This was especially the case as Cyprus was an important source of copper for much of the region. Mesopotamia (\\"The Land of Two Rivers\\") is considered to begin more or less near the modern border with Iraq and refers to the flat valley of the southern Tigris and Euphrates rivers and their tributaries. These rivers empty into the Shatt al-Arab waterway that separates Iraq from Iran. Sumerology is a very specialized discipline that deals with the history, language and archaeology of ancient Sumer (southern Mesopotamia), mostly during the 4th and 3rd millennium BCE. Assyriology deals with the Assyrians who succeeded the Sumerians and covers much of the region while that language was still in use. Iran, sometimes known as Persia, includes a large plateau and its periphery, including the Zagros Mountains. Sub-disciplines of this region deal mostly with the languages, history and archaeology of regions within this large area.

The Arabian Peninsula and its offshore islands is a separate geographical zone that has contacts with Sinai, the well-watered regions to the north, and by sea with the far-east. Organisations Due to the historic interest in the archaeology of the Near East, especially due to the Biblical links of the area, there are a large number of organisations dedicated to the archaeological investigation of the region. These include the American Schools of Oriental Research which publishes the journal Near Eastern Archaeology Magazine, the Council for British Research in the Levant which publishes the journal Levant, and The Netherlands Institute for the Near East which publishes the journal Bibliotheca Orientalis.

He was managing director and head of the drafting department of the shipbuilding company Harland and Wolff in Belfast, Ireland. He is best remembered for being the naval architect that was in charge of the plans for the ocean liner , and was on board the ship during her maiden voyage. He perished along with more than 1500 others when the ship sank after hitting an iceberg, and his body was never recovered. Early life Thomas (second from right) with family, circa 1895. Thomas Andrews was born on 7 February 1873 at Ardara House, Comber, County Down, in Ireland, to The Rt. Hon. Thomas Andrews, a member of the Privy Council of Ireland, and Eliza Pirrie. Andrews was a Presbyterian of Scottish descent, and like his brother considered himself British. His siblings included John Miller Andrews, the future Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, and Sir James Andrews, the future Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland. Thomas Andrews lived with his family in Ardara, Comber. In 1884, he began attending the Royal Belfast Academical Institution until 1889 when, at the age of sixteen, he began a premium apprenticeship at Harland and Wolff where his uncle, the Viscount Pirrie, was part owner. Andrews with wife, Helen Barbour, and daughter, Elizabeth Law Barber Andrews Harland and Wolff At Harland and Wolff, Andrews began with three months in the joiners' shop, followed by a month in the cabinetmakers' and then a further two months working on the ships. The last eighteen months of his five-year apprenticeship were spent in the drawing office. He worked tirelessly during the day and continued his studies in the evening hours. In 1901, boarding at 11 Wellington Place, after working his way up through the many departments of the company, he became the manager of the construction works. That same year, he also became a member of the Institution of Naval Architects. In 1907, he was appointed the managing director and head of the drafting department at Harland and Wolff. By that point, Andrews had earned a reputation as a genius in the field of ship design. During his long years of apprenticeship, study, and work, he had become well-loved in the company and amongst the shipyard's employees. His kindness and generosity was well-documented. He was always willing to acknowledge the hard work of other people, and his wife recalled that he had of himself \\"the humblest opinion of anyone I ever knew.\\"¬´ The character of Thomas Andrews ¬ª, Thomas Andrews Shipbuilder. Consult√© le 21 avril 2011 On 24 June 1908, he married Helen Reilly Barbour, daughter of textile industrialist John Doherty Barbour and sister to Sir John Milne Barbour- known as \\"Milne\\". Their daughter, Elizabeth Law-Barbour Andrews (known by her initials, \\"ELBA\\"), was born on 27 November 1910. The couple lived at Dunallan, 12 Windsor Avenue, Belfast, now numbered 20.NationalArchives.ieUlster History Cycle It is known that Andrews took Helen to view the RMS Titanic one night, shortly before Elizabeth was born. RMS Titanic In 1907, Andrews began to oversee the plans for three new ocean liners for the White Star Line: the RMS Olympic, the RMS Titanic and the RMS (later HMHS) Britannic. All three ships were designed by William Pirrie and general manager Alexander Carlisle along with Andrews to be the largest, safest and most luxurious ships at sea. As he had done for the other ships he had overseen, Andrews familiarised himself with every detail of Olympic, Titanic and Britannic, in order to ensure that they were in optimal working order. Andrews's suggestions that the ship have 48 lifeboats (instead of the 20 it ended up with) as well as a double hull and watertight bulkheads that went up to B deck, were overruled. Andrews headed a group of Harland and Wolff workers called the guarantee group, who went on the maiden voyages of their ships in order to observe ship operations and spot any necessary improvements. Titanic was no exception, so Andrews and the rest of his Harland and Wolff group travelled from Belfast to Southampton on Titanic for the beginning of her maiden voyage on 10 April 1912. During the voyage, Andrews took notes on various improvements he felt were needed, primarily cosmetic changes to various facilities. However, on 14 April, Andrews remarked to a friend that Titanic was \\"as nearly perfect as human brains can make her.\\" On 14 April at 11:40 PM, Titanic struck an iceberg on the ship's starboard side. Andrews was in his cabin, planning changes he wanted to make to the ship, and barely noticed the collision. Captain Edward J. Smith had Andrews summoned to help examine the damage. Andrews and Captain Smith discussed the damage to the ship shortly after the collision and toured the damaged section of the ship, receiving several reports of the vessel's damage. Andrews determined that the first six of the ship's 16 watertight compartments were rapidly flooding, which is more than the four that the vessel was supposed to withstand. He relayed this information to Captain Smith, stating that it was a 'mathematical certainty' that ship will sink and adding that in his opinion, the vessel had only about an hour before foundering. He also informed Smith of the severe shortage of lifeboats on board the ship. As the evacuation began, Andrews tirelessly searched staterooms telling the passengers to put on lifebelts and go up on deck. Many survivors testified to have met or spotted Andrews several times. Fully aware of the short time the ship had left and of the lack of lifeboat space for all passengers and crew, he continued to urge reluctant people into the lifeboats in the hope of filling them with as many people as possible. Titanic foundered at 2:30 a.m, and Andrews perished along with more than 1500 others. His body was never recovered. Death Andrews was reportedly last seen by John Stewart, a steward on the ship, after approximately 2:10 a.m. Andrews was standing alone in the 1st-class smoking room with his arms folded, his lifebelt lying on a nearby table. He was staring at a Norman Wilkinson painting over the fire place that depicted the entrance to Plymouth Sound, which Titanic had been expected to visit on her return voyage.The painting is often incorrectly shown on television and in movies as depicting the entrance to New York Harbor. It was an error made by Walter Lord in his research. Stewart asked him: \\"Aren't you going to have a try for it, Mr. Andrews?\\" Andrews didn't answer or move, apparently in a state of shock. ¬´ The sinking of the Titanic ¬ª, Thomas Andrews Shipbuilder. Consult√© le 21 avril 2011 Although this has become one of the most famous legends of the Titanic disaster ‚Äì published in a 1912 book (Thomas Andrews: Shipbuilder by Shan Bullock) and thereby perpetuated ‚Äì there is circumstantial evidence to show that Stewart, in fact, left the ship in lifeboat No. 15 at approximately 1:40 a.m.,On a Sea of Glass: The Life & Loss of the RMS Titanic by Tad Fitch, J. Kent Layton & Bill Wormstedt. Amberley Books, March 2012. pp 321-323 half an hour before his reputed sighting of Andrews. Another sighting of Andrews was around 2:00 a.m., where he was seen on the back of the boat deck. The crowd had begun to stir, but some women remained reluctant to leave the ship. To be heard and to draw attention to himself, Andrews waved his arms and called to them in a loud voice.. This didn't do anything, so he began frantically throwing deck chairs into the ocean for people to use as floation devices. On two newspaper accounts, steward Cecil William N Fitzpatrick claimed to have seen Andrews and Captain Smith together on the bridge having a conversation, and that he later saw both men jumped overboard just before the bridge was submerged. Legacy Unionist banner in Belfast commemorating Thomas Andrews On 19 April 1912, his father received a telegram from his mother's cousin, who had spoken with survivors in New York: \\"INTERVIEW WITH TITANIC'S OFFICERS. ALL UNANIMOUS THAT ANDREWS DIED A HEROIC DEATH, THINKING ONLY OF OTHER'S SAFETY. EXTEND HEARTFELT SYMPATHY TO ALL.\\" Newspaper accounts of the disaster labelled Andrews a hero. Mary Sloan, a stewardess on the ship, whom Andrews persuaded to enter a lifeboat, later wrote in a letter: \\"Mr. Andrews met his fate like a true hero, realising the great danger, and gave up his life to save the women and children of the Titanic. They will find it hard to replace him.\\" A short biography was produced within the year by Shan Bullock at the request of Sir Horace Plunkett, a member of Parliament, who felt that Andrews' life was worthy of being memorialised. In his home town, Comber, one of the earliest and most substantial memorials for a single victim of the Titanic disaster was built. The Thomas Andrews Jr. Memorial Hall was opened in January 1914. The architects were Young and McKenzie with sculpted work by the artist Sophia Rosamond Praeger. The hall is now maintained by the South Eastern Education Board and used by The Andrews Memorial Primary School. An Ulster History Circle blue plaque is located on his house in Windsor Avenue, Belfast. Today, the SS Nomadic is the sole surviving ship designed by Andrews, and Asteroid 245158 Thomasandrews was named in his honour in 2004. Family After Thomas's death, Helen remarried; she died 22 August 1966 in Northern Ireland and is buried in the Barbour family mausoleum at Lambeg.

Unlike a standard pickup truck, the El Camino was adapted from the standard two-door Chevrolet station wagon platform and integrated the cab and cargo bed into the body. Introduced in the 1959 model year in response to the success of the Ford Ranchero pickup, its first run lasted only two years. Production resumed for the 1964‚Äì1977 model years based on the Chevelle platform, and continued for the 1978‚Äì1987 model years based on the GM G-body platform. Although based on corresponding General Motors car lines, the vehicle is classified in the United States as a pickup.https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id;=3659&id;=2440&id;=1520&id;=27324 GMC's badge engineered El Camino variant, the Sprint, was introduced for the 1971 model year. Renamed Caballero in 1978, it was also produced through the 1987 model year. History Origin The concept of a two-door vehicle based on a passenger car chassis with a tray at the rear began in the United States in the 1920s with the roadster utility (also called \\"roadster pickup\\" or \\"light delivery\\") models. Ford Australia was the first company to produce a coup√© utility as a result of a 1932 letter from the wife of a farmer in Victoria, Australia, asking for \\"a vehicle to go to church in on a Sunday and which can carry our pigs to market on Mondays\\". Ford designer Lew Bandt developed a suitable solution, and the first coup√© utility model was released in 1934. Bandt went on to manage Ford's Advanced Design Department, being responsible for the body engineering of the XP, XT, XW, and XA series Ford Falcon utilities. General Motors‚Äô Australian subsidiary Holden also produced a Chevrolet coup√© utility in 1935, Studebaker produced the Coup√© Express from 1937 to 1939. The body style did not reappear on the American market until the release of the 1957 Ford Ranchero. Both the coup√© utility and the similar open-topped roadster utility continued in production, but the improving economy of the mid- to late-1930s and the desire for improved comfort saw coup√© utility sales climb at the expense of the roadster utility until, by 1939, the latter was all but a fading memory. The mid-1955 introduction of Chevrolet's Cameo Carrier pickup truck helped pave the way for the El Camino. Although it was a model variant of Chevrolet's Task Force light-duty pickup, the Cameo offered an array of car-like features that included passenger-car styling, fiberglass rear fenders, two-tone paint, a relatively luxurious interior, as well as an optional V8 engine, automatic transmission, and power assists. As always, there was a GMC version offered during the same time, called the GMC Suburban with the same features offered on the Chevrolet. In 1957 a special version was made for GMC to be shown at national car shows called the Palomino, which had a Pontiac V8 installed, borrowed from the 1957 Star Chief. Other pickup truck producers, including Dodge, Ford, Studebaker, and International, began to offer flush-side cargo boxes on some of their 1957 models, such as the Dodge C Series, and the Studebaker E-series Deluxe. However, Ford also introduced the 1957 Ranchero, and established a new market segment in the U.S. market of an automobile platform based coup√© utility. In 1959, Chevrolet responded with the El Camino to compete with Ford's full-sized Ranchero. The original El Camino and Ranchero would compete directly only in the 1959 model year.The Editors of Consumer Guide File:55 Chevrolet Cameo Carrier (front).jpg1955 Chevrolet Cameo Carrier File:GMC Suburban 1955 Pickup 100 RSideFront Lake Mirror Cassic 16Oct2010 (14690586529).jpg1955 GMC Suburban File:Chevrolet Cameo 1956 Pickup LRear Lake Mirror Cassic 16Oct2010 (14874856814).jpg1956 Chevrolet Cameo Carrier rear view File:1957 GMC Suburban Carrier.jpg1957 GMC Suburban File:GMC Suburban 1957 Palomino Pickup 100 show truck RSideFront Lake Mirror Cassic 16Oct2010 (14690584709).jpg1957 GMC Palomino File:GMC Suburban 1958 Pickup 100 LSideFront Lake Mirror Cassic 16Oct2010 (14876890302).jpg1958 GMC Suburban File:GMC Suburban 1959 Pickup 100 solitary example RRear Lake Mirror Cassic 16Oct2010 (14876889092).jpg1959 GMC Suburban rear view First generation (1959‚Äì1960) The El Camino was introduced for the 1959 model year two years after the Ford Ranchero. According to Chevrolet stylist Chuck Jordan, GM Harley Earl had suggested a coup√© pickup in 1952. Like the Ranchero, it was based on an existing and modified platform, the new-for-1959 Brookwood two-door station wagon, itself based on the completely redesigned, longer, lower and wider full-sized Chevrolet. Highly stylized, it initially sold 50% more briskly than the more conservative Ranchero, some 22,000 to 14,000. Unlike the Brookwoods wagon and a sedan delivery variant, the El Camino was available with any full-sized Chevrolet drivetrain. It came in a single trim level, its exterior using the mid-level Bel-Air's trim, and the interior of the low-end Biscayne. Its chassis featured Chevrolet's \\"Safety-Girder\\" X-frame design and a full-coil suspension, both introduced in the 1958 model year. The wheel-base was longer, and overall length for all 1959 Chevrolets was up to . The El Camino's payload rating ranged from , with gross vehicle weights ranging from depending on powertrain and suspension. The somewhat soft passenger car suspension of the base model left the vehicle level without a load, in contrast the Ranchero, where standard 1100-pound rated heavy duty rear springs gave it a distinct rake when empty. The quirky Level Air suspension option, in its second and final year, was listed as available, but was almost never seen on any Chevrolet model, much less an El Camino. The 1959 El Camino was promoted as the first Chevrolet pickup built with a steel bed floor instead of wood. The floor was a corrugated sheetmetal insert, secured with 26 recessed bolts. Concealed beneath it was the floor pan from the Brookwood two-door wagon, complete with foot wells. Box capacity was almost . Among the performance engines offered were a 283-cid Turbo-Fire V8 with two- or four-barrel carburetion, several Turbo-Thrust 348-cid V8s with four-barrel or triple two- barrel carburetors producing , and 250- and 290-bhp 283-cube Ramjet Fuel Injection V8s. Hot Rod magazine conducted a test of an El Camino equipped with the hottest powertrain combination available in early 1959‚Äîa , triple-carb, solid-lifter 348 V8 mated to a four-speed. Staff testers clocked 0-60 mph times of around seven seconds, estimated top speed at , and predicted 14-second/100-mph quarter-mile performance with a rear-axle ratio suitable for drag racing installed. A total of 22,246 El Caminos were produced for 1959. That bested the count of 21,706 first-year Rancheros made in 1957 and the 14,169 Ford sedan pickups built in direct competition for the 1959 model year. But 1960 would be a different story. The similar but less flamboyant 1960 model started at $2366 for the six-cylinder model; another $107 for a V8 with the two-barrel 283. At first glance, the exterior once again had a Bel Air look, with that series' bright-metal \\"jet\\" appliqu√© and narrow trailing molding used to accent the rear quarters. Inside, Biscayne/Brookwood appointments also persisted. The seat was now covered in striped-pattern cloth with vinyl facings. Available interior trim shades were once again gray, blue, and green. Floor coverings were in medium-tone vinyl. Mid-1959 powertrain availability was carried over with minimal changes for 1960: The base 283-cid V8 was detuned a bit for fuel economy and was now rated at , and the fuel- injected engines were officially gone. Orders plummeted by a third, to just 14,163, at which point Chevrolet discontinued the model; meanwhile, Ford moved 21,027 Rancheros, which were now based on the brand-new Falcon compact. The pioneering American sedan pickups just did not connect with enough car-buying Americans. Perhaps these early \\"crossovers\\" didn't carry enough passengers; in a time when baby-boomer families dominated the market, three across was the best they could offer. Cargo volume was meager compared with pickup trucks. The low-level trim and marketing efforts focused almost exclusively on commercial customers may have inhibited sales, as well.

The 1964 model was similar to the Chevelle two-door wagon forward of the B-pillars and carried both \\"Chevelle\\" and \\"El Camino\\" badges, but Chevrolet marketed the vehicle as a utility model and Chevelle's most powerful engines were not available. Initial engine offerings included six-cylinder engines of 194 and 230 cubic inches with horsepower ratings of , respectively. The standard V8 was a 283 cubic-inch Chevrolet small block with two-barrel carburetor and with optional engines including a 283 with four-barrel carburetor and dual exhausts. Added to the El Camino's option list during the course of the 1964 model year were two versions of the 327 cubic-inch small block V8 rated at ‚Äîthe latter featuring a higher compression ratio of 10.5:1, larger four-barrel carburetor and dual exhausts.1964 El Camino brochure El Caminos also featured Air shocks in the rear, as well as fully boxed frames. The shocks were continued over all generations, the frames only thru 1967.Owner observation =1965= The 1965 El Camino received the same facelift as the '65 Chevelle, with a more pronounced V-shaped front end, and a higher performance L79 version of the 327 engine rated at that was also available in Chevelles. Most of the other engines were carried over from 1964, including the 194 and 230 cubic-inch Turbo Thrift sixes, the 283 cubic-inch Turbo-Fire V8 and 327 cubic-inch Turbo-Fire V8s of .1965 El Camino brochure =1966= In 1966, GM added a V8 engine to the lineup rated from 325 to . The 1965 327 would run low 15s in the 1/4 mile (at some 90 mph), while 1966 to 1969 models were easily into the mid- to upper-14s. New sheetmetal highlighted the 1966 El Camino, identical to the Chevelle. A new instrument panel with horizontal sweep speedometer was featured. Inside, the standard version featured a bench seat interior and rubber floor mat from the low-line Chevelle 300 series, while the Custom used a more upscale interior from the Chevelle Malibu with plusher cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl bench seats and deep twist carpeting, or optional Strato swivel bucket seats with console. A tachometer was optional. =1967= The 1967 El Camino followed the Chevelle's styling facelift with a new grille, front bumper, and trim. Air shocks remained standard equipment on the El Camino, allowing the driver to compensate for a load. The 1967 model year also brought the collapsible steering column and options of disc brakes and Turbo Hydramatic 400 3-speed automatic transmission. It was the second year the 396 (L35, L34, and L78) could be had in the El Camino (both 13480 300 Deluxe base and 13680 Malibu series). Since the L35 396/325 hp engine was the base for the SS396 series, the number of L35 engines reported sold by Chevrolet in 1967 (2,565) were sold in one of the two El Camino series, which were the only other series the engine could be ordered in. Since the L34 () & L78 () were available in either El Camino series as well as the two SS396 body styles, there is no way of knowing how many of these optional engines went to which body style. Chevrolet does report 17,176 L34 and 612 L78 engine options were sold in 1967 Chevelles, but there is no breakdown of body styles. The TH400 3-speed automatic was now available as an option (RPO M40) with the 396 engine in both the SS396 series and the 396-equipped El Caminos. The 3-speed manual transmission remained the standard transmission with a heavy duty (RPO M13) also available along with the 2-speed Powerglide and either M20 wide ratio or M21 close ratio 4-speed transmissions. Although there was no actual factory El Camino Super Sport until 1968, many owners have \\"cloned\\" '67 SS396s using 1967 Chevelle SS396 badges and trim. Chevelle EL CAMINO.jpg1965 Chevrolet El Camino 1967 Chevrolet El Camino 22.09.20 JM (3).jpg1967 Chevrolet El Camino Third generation (1968‚Äì1972) Chevrolet introduced a longer El Camino in 1968, based on the Chevelle station wagon/four-door sedan wheelbase (, overall length: ); it also shared Chevelle Malibu exterior and interior trims. The interior was revamped including cloth and vinyl or all- vinyl bench seats and deep twist carpeting. All-vinyl Strato bucket seats and center console were an $111 option. Power front disc brakes and Positraction were optional. A new, high-performance Super Sport SS396 version was launched. The Turbo-Jet 396 was offered in or versions. Returning to the official options list for the first time since late 1966 was the L78. It had solid lifters, big-port heads, and an 800 cfm Holley four-barrel on a low-rise aluminum manifold. A three-speed manual was standard with all engines, and a four-speed or automatic was optional. In 1968, the SS was a separate model (the \\"SS-396\\"). The 1969 models showed only minor changes, led by more-rounded front-end styling. A single chrome bar connected quad headlights, and a slotted bumper held the parking lights. New round instrument pods replaced the former linear layout. For the first time, the Chevrolet 350 V8 was used in an El Camino. The Super Sport group included a 396-cubic-inch V8 beneath a double-domed hood, along with a black-out grille displaying an SS emblem. More potent editions of the 396 engine, developing also made the options list. Options included power windows and locks. Curiously, back-up lights moved from the rear bumper to the tailgate, where they were ineffective when the gate was down. The 1970 models received sheet metal revisions that gave the bodies a more squared-up stance, and interiors were also redesigned. The new SS396, which actually displaced (although all emblems read 396) was available. Chevrolet's largest and most-powerful engine of the time was also put into a select few El Caminos. The LS6 454 CID engine, rated at and of torque, gave the El Camino 1/4-mile times in the upper 13-second range at around . The 1971 El Camino got fresh front-end styling (again shared with the Chevelle) that included large Power-Beam single-unit headlights, a reworked grille and bumper, and integral park/signal/marker lights. For 1971, mandated lower- octane unleaded fuel necessitated a reduction in engine compression, and GM's A.I.R. system, a \\"smog pump\\", was added to control tailpipe emissions. Power and performance were reduced. Engine offerings for 1971 included the 250-6, small-block V8s of 307 and 350 cubic inches; and big block V8s of 402 and 454-cubic-inch displacements. Horsepower ratings of those engines for 1971 ranged from 145 for the six to 365 for the RPO LS5 454 ‚Äì all in gross figures. The LS6 454 V8 was gone forever. A rebadged El Camino, the GMC Sprint debuted in 1971. It shared the same engine and transmission offerings as its Chevrolet counterpart. The 1972 El Caminos wore single-unit parking and side marker lights on their front fenders, outside of a revised twin-bar grille, but little changed. For 1972, horsepower measurements were switched to the \\"net\\" figures as installed in a vehicle with all accessories and emission controls hooked up. Engine offerings included the 250-6, a 307 V8, a 350-cubic-inch V8, and big block V8s of 402 and 454 cubic-inch displacements. The 402-cubic-inch (still known as a 396) produced ; the 454 managed to put out under the net rating system. Super Sport equipment could now be ordered with any V8 engine, including the base 307-cubic-inch version. All 1972 El Caminos with the 454 ci engine have a \\"W\\" as the fifth digit in the VIN, and the 454 was only available with Super Sport trim. Fourth generation (1973‚Äì1977) For 1973, the El Camino was redesigned. Matching the Chevelle line and using the wagon chassis, it was the largest El Camino generation. Energy-absorbing hydraulic front bumper systems on these vehicles added more weight. There were two different trim levels of El Caminos during this period. The base model and SS option shared interior and exterior appointments with the Chevelle Malibu, while the El Camino Classic (introduced for 1974) shared its trim with the more upscale Chevelle Malibu Classic. The chassis design was as new as the bodies with a wider wheel track, front and rear. The left wheel was adjusted to have slightly more positive camber than the right, which resulted in a more uniform and stable steering feel on high-crown road surfaces while maintaining excellent freeway cruise stability. Clearances for spring travel were also improved for a smoother ride over all types of surfaces; the coil springs at each wheel were computer-selected to match the individual car's weight. Front disc brakes were now standard on all '73 El Caminos. Additional new features were an acoustical double-panel roof, tighter-fitting glass, flush-style outside door handles, molded full-foam seat construction, flow-through power ventilation system, inside hood release, refined Delcotron generator and sealed side-terminal battery, a larger fuel tank, and \\"flush and dry\\" rocker panels introduced first on the redesigned 1971 full-size Chevrolets. New options included swivel bucket seats (with console) and Turbine I urethane (backed by steel) wheels, as was the instrument gauge cluster.1973‚Äì1977 Chevrolet El camino brochures A benefit of the new body designs was much better visibility to which the unusually thin windshield pillars contributed. A structural improvement was a stronger design for the side door guard beams. El Caminos shared the \\"Colonnade\\" frameless door glass with other Chevelles, and would continue this feature into the next generation as well. The 307 2-barrel V8 with was the base engine. Options included a 350 2-barrel V8 with , a 350 4-barrel V8 with , and a 454 4-barrel V8 with . Hardened engine valve seats and hydraulic camshafts made these engines reliable for many miles, and allowed them to accept the increasingly popular unleaded regular gasoline. The three-speed manual transmission was standard; 4-speed manual and Turbo Hydra- Matic 3-speed automatic transmissions were optional. Crossflow radiators and coolant reservoirs prevented overheating.1973 Chevrolet Chevelle Brochure 1973 El Camino 1973 El Camino SS The SS, then a trim option, included a black grill with SS emblem, bodyside striping, bright roof drip moldings, color-keyed dual sport mirrors, special front and rear stabilizer bars, rally wheels, 70-series raised white-lettered tires, special instrumentation and SS interior emblems. The SS option was available with a 350 or 454 V8 with the 4-speed or Turbo Hydra-Matic transmissions. Also it was not widely known, but a Laguna S-3 front end could be fitted on these cars, and was available through the Central Office Production Option (COPO) system as code 6H1. It was not widely ordered by many however, more than likely due to limited information both on the part of customers and many dealers at the time. Cars of the 70's ‚Äì By the Editors of Consumer Guide The 1974 El Caminos sported an elongated, Mercedes-type grille. Inside, the new top-of-the-line El Camino Classic featured luxurious interiors with notchback bench seats (or optional Strato bucket seats) upholstered in cloth or vinyl, carpeted door panels and woodgrain instrument panel trim. The 350 V8 became the base engine and a 400 V8 engine was new this year. The 454, the top engine, was available with the Turbo Hydra-Matic 400 automatic or 4-speed manual transmission. The 1975 models featured a new grill, providing a fresh appearance. Suspension upgrades offered a quieter ride, and radial-ply tires became standard. Dual remote mirrors, new twin sport mirrors, intermittent wipers, and cruise control were among new convenience features this year. The 1975 high energy ignition (HEI) provided spark to the spark plugs with minimal maintenance and increased power. The larger distributor cap also provided better high-RPM performance by decreasing the likelihood of the spark conducting to the wrong terminal. The 250-cubic- inch in-line six of was offered as the base engine. The 454-cubic-inch V8, downrated yet again to , made it into 1975 as an El Camino option, but this would be its last go-around. It was not available in California, and the optional four-speed stick was no longer offered. Buyers could now choose an Econominder instrument package that included a vacuum gauge to point out when optimum fuel economy was being attained. 1977 El Camino Classic For 1976, El Camino Classic models now featured the new rectangular headlights that other high-end GM cars were sporting. These were quad units in stacked arrangement. The base model retained the previously used dual round headlights. Engines included the base 250 I6 engine, a new 305-cubic-inch V8, two- and four-barrel 350s (with availability still depending on California delivery), and the 400-cubic-inch V8, still good for . All engines except the 250 I6 came with the Turbo Hydra-matic automatic transmission as the only transmission available. The 250 I6 came with a 3-speed manual or an optional Turbo Hydra- matic. The 1977 models were little changed, except the 400 V8 was gone. The El Camino Classic was again the top model and the SS option continued.1973‚Äì77 El Camino brochures Fifth generation (1978‚Äì1987) The 1978 through 1987 El Caminos were produced in four trim levels: Classic, Black Knight (1978)/Royal Knight (1979‚Äì83), Conquista and Super Sport, and shared chassis components with the Chevrolet Malibu. Chevrolet 90¬∞ V6 and Buick V6 engines were used for the first time. The optional 305 cubic-inch small block V8 was rated at , and from 1982‚Äì1984, the Oldsmobile-sourced diesel engine was also optional. A new, trimmer El Camino was unveiled in 1978, adopting the new, more sharp-edged Malibu styling, and a one-inch longer wheelbase of . The front end sheet metal and doors were shared with the Malibu, and the rear tailgate and bumper was shared with the Malibu station wagon. For the first time, though, the El Camino had a unique chassis ‚Äì it was shared with no other Chevrolet. The front end featured a new single rectangular headlight design. The base engine was a 200-cubic-inch (3.3-liter) V6 that developed , except in California where, to meet emissions standards, the 231-cubic-inch Buick engine was the base engine. Two upgrades could be ordered: a 305-cubic-inch V8 with , or a 350-cubic-inch V8 with that was only available in El Caminos and Malibu station wagons. It was not available on Malibu passenger cars (with exception to coupe and sedan Malibu 9C1 police vehicles). Among GM makes, at least, the era of bigness was fading into history, overtaken by a new age of efficiency and economy. The 1979 model got minimal changes following its debut as a redesigned \\"new-size\\" model in 1978. Alterations to the 1979 El Camino amounting to little more than a new divided grille. However, a \\"small-block\\" 267-cubic-inch (4.4-liter) V8 joined the options list and slotted between the standard 3.3-liter V6 and the optional 5.0-liter four-barrel V8. The 350-cubic-inch (5.7-liter) V8, developing was again available. Both three- and four-speed manual transmissions had floor shifters. The 1980 El Camino started out the 1980s with few changes, though engine choices were shuffled a little. The base V6 displaced 229 cubic inches, up from 200 the year before. Horsepower increased from . Optional again were a 267-cubic-inch V8 with and a 305 V8, now with (down five). The 350 with offered in 1979 was dropped. A three speed floor shifted manual transmission was standard, but most got the optional three- speed automatic. The 1981 models received a new horizontal tube grill. The 1981 engines mostly continued from 1980, but now used GM's Computer Command Control (CCC) emission system. The base 229-cubic-inch V6 made (down from ), as did the California-only 231-cubic-inch Buick V6. Optional engines were the 267-cubic-inch V8 with and The 305-cubic-inch V8, now with . The three-speed automatic added a lock-up torque converter to aid highway mileage. =1982-1984 = The 1982 (through the final 1987) El Camino sported a new frontal appearance with a crosshatch grille flanked by quad rectangular headlights. New under the hood for 1982 was a 5.7-liter (350-cubic-inch) Diesel V8, which was also offered in Chevrolet's full-size cars. Though mileage with the diesel was commendable, it was an expensive option and would eventually amass a dismal repair record. Gasoline-engine choices were unchanged, except Chevrolet's 229-cubic-inch (3.8-liter) V6 was now standard in California-bound cars, replacing Buick's 231-cubic-inch V6. In 1983, the 4.4-liter V8 was gone, leaving the 5.0-liter version as the only optional gas V8. The standard engine was again Chevrolet's 3.8-liter V6 with , though California cars, once again, got a Buick V6 with similar specifications. Continuing on the options list was the 5.7-liter V8 Diesel with . The sister Malibu sedan and wagon were discontinued after the 1983 model year. The 1983‚Äì87 El Camino SS was offered as a conversion (completed by Choo-Choo Customs Inc., of Chattanooga, Tennessee) to include the aerodynamic front end similar to the Monte Carlo SS, but did not receive the L69 engine package. =1985-1987= GM shifted El Camino production to Mexico, and the new fuel- injected 4.3 L V6 became the base engine through 1987. El Camino production ended quietly in late 1987. Some model year 1987's (420 El Caminos and 325 GMC Caballeros) are listed as new car retail deliveries in calendar year 1988 based on their date of first retail sale. Speculation in online forums indicates 3GCCW80H2HS915586 \\"may\\" be the final vehicle. The GM Media Archive/Heritage Center confirmed that no MY 1988 El Caminos or Caballeros were produced. 1979 El Camino 1982‚Äì1987 El Camino South Africa 1971 Chevrolet El Camino (South Africa) A range of Chevrolet models, based on the Holden HK, was introduced onto the South African market in 1969.Louis F.

This was a styling exercise for a possible Pontiac version of the El Camino; the concept never reached production. In 1992, GM unveiled an El Camino concept, basically a pickup variant of the Chevrolet Lumina Z34. The concept received mixed, mostly negative reviews, mostly because of its front wheel drive layout. 2010 Pontiac G8 ST concept at the 2008 alt= During the 1995 model year, GM had a concept El Camino based on the full-size Caprice station wagon using the grille of a 1994‚Äì96 Impala SS; this concept was destined for production, but was shelved when GM decided to discontinue the B-platform car line at the end of 1996. The Pontiac G8 ST was shown at the New York International Auto Show in March 2008. Based on the Holden Commodore Ute, it shared the G8 platform with a cargo bed. The Sport Truck had the same , 6.0-liter V8 used in the G8 GT, as well as the 3.6-liter, direct-injection V6. The G8 ST was slated for release as a 2010 model, but in January 2009, GM announced to dealers the G8 ST was cancelled due to budget cuts and restructuring. In 2011, GM again considered bringing back the El Camino under the Chevrolet brand as early as 2015.

Most of the dead were reportedly shot in their backs. The march had been organized by the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party to commemorate the abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico by the governing Spanish National Assembly in 1873, and to protest the U.S. government's imprisonment of the Party's leader, Pedro Albizu Campos, on sedition charges. An investigation led by the United States Commission on Civil Rights put the blame for the massacre squarely on the U.S.-appointed governor of Puerto Rico, Blanton Winship. Further criticism by members of the U.S. Congress led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to remove Winship in 1939 as governor. Governor Winship was never prosecuted for the massacre and no one under his chain of command ‚Äì including the police who took part in the event, and admitted to the mass shooting ‚Äì was ever prosecuted or reprimanded. The Ponce massacre remains the largest massacre in post-Spanish imperial history in Puerto Rico. It has been the source of many articles, books, paintings, films, and theatrical works. Chronology of events Carlos Torres Morales, a photo journalist for the newspaper El Imparcial was covering the march and took this photograph when the shooting began. Several days before the scheduled Palm Sunday march, the Nationalists had received legal permits for a peaceful protest from Jos√© Tormos Diego, the mayor of Ponce. According to a 1926 Puerto Rico Supreme Court ruling, government permits were not necessary for the use of plazas, parks or streets for meetings or parades. As a courtesy to the Ponce municipal government, the Nationalists nevertheless requested the permit. Upon learning about the march, the U.S.-appointed governor of Puerto Rico, General Blanton Winship, ordered the new Insular Police Chief, Colonel Enrique de Orbeta, to contact Mayor Tormos and have him cancel the parade permit. He ordered the police chief to increase the police force in the southern city, and to stop, \\"by all means necessary\\", any demonstration conducted by the nationalists in Ponce. Without notice to the organizers, or any opportunity to appeal, or any time to arrange an alternate venue, the permits were abruptly withdrawn, just before the protest was scheduled to begin. Following Governor Winship's orders, Colonel de Orbeta went to Ponce where he concentrated police units from across the island sporting \\"the latest riot control equipment\\", among which he included the machine gunners in the island. Winship intended to crush the activities of the Nationalists and their leader, Pedro Albizu Campos. Police Chief de Orbeta and Insular Police officers, immediately after the massacre The Insular Police, a force somewhat resembling the National Guard, was under the direct military command of Governor Winship and ultimate responsibility for the massacre fell on Winship, who controlled the National Guard and Insular Police, and ordered the shootings. Police Chief Guillermo Soldevilla of the municipality of Juana D√≠az, with 14 policemen, took a position in front of the marchers. Chief Perez Segarra and Sgt. Rafael Molina, commanding nine policemen armed with Thompson submachine guns and tear gas bombs, stood in the back. Chief of Police Antonio Bernardi, heading 11 policemen armed with machine guns, stood in the east; and another group of 12 police, armed with rifles, was placed in the west. According to some reports, police numbered \\"over 200 heavily armed\\" guards. The \\"Viva la Rep√∫blica, Abajo los Asesinos\\" (English: \\"Long live the Republic, Down with the Murderers!\\") message which cadet Bol√≠var M√°rquez Telechea wrote with his blood before he died. As La Borinque√±a, Puerto Rico's national song, was being played, the Ponce branch of the Cadets of the Republic under the command of Tom√°s L√≥pez de Victoria and the rest of the demonstrators began to march. The Insular Police started firing on the marchers ‚Äì killing 17 unarmed civilians, two policemen, and wounding some 235 civilians, including women and children. Police firing went on for over 15 minutes. The dead included 17 men, one woman, and a young girl. Some of the dead were demonstrators/cadets, while others were passersby. As of 2009, only two survivors were known to be alive, siblings Fernando and Beatriz V√©lez. The flag-bearer of the Cadets of the Republic was shot and killed during the massacre. A young girl, Carmen Fern√°ndez proceeded to take the flag, but was shot and gravely injured. A young Nationalist cadet named Bol√≠var M√°rquez dragged himself to the wall of Santo Asilo de Damas and wrote with his blood the following message before dying:Jose Enrique Ayoroa Santaliz. La Masacre de Ponce: Breve relacion de hechos y algunos de sus personajes. Ponce, Puerto Rico: Ponce Massacre Museum. March 2011. Many were chased by the police and shot or clubbed at the entrance of their houses as they tried to escape. Others were taken from their hiding places and killed. Leopold Tormes, a member of the Puerto Rico legislature, claimed to reporters that a policeman had murdered a nationalist with his bare hands.Denis, Nelson Antonio. War Against All Puerto Ricans, Revolution and Terror in America's Colony, p. 263, Nation Books; ; Dr. Jos√© Gandara, a physician who assisted the wounded, testified that wounded people running away were shot, and that many were again wounded by the clubs and bare fists of the police. No arms were found in the hands of the civilians wounded, nor on the dead ones. About 150 of the demonstrators were arrested immediately afterward; they were later released on bail. Official version of the events The next day, Winship radioed Washington and reported, officially, that the Nationalists had initiated the shooting.Radiogram from Blanton Winship to Ernest Gruening, Director of the Division of Territories and Insular Possessions, Department of the Interior. 23 March 1937. Arthur Garfield Hayes Collection. Seeley G. Mudd Research Library. Princeton University. Part of his radiogram report stated that \\"two shots were fired by the Nationalists ... with Nationalists firing from the street, and from roofs and balconies on both sides of the street ... [the police] showed great patience, consideration and understanding of the situation, as did the officers and men under him [the Police Chief].\\" The following day, as a result of this misinformation, the New York Times and Washington Post reported that a Nationalist political revolt had claimed the lives of more than eighteen people in Puerto Rico.Rodriguez- Perez, Katherine. Reports on the Ponce Massacre: How the U.S. Press Protected U.S. Government Interests in the Wake of Tragedy. Wesleyan Scholar (2010), pg. 10. The Puerto Rican senator Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n traveled to the city of Ponce to investigate the event. After examining the photograph taken by Carlos Torres Morales of El Imparcial, which had not yet been published, he wrote a letter to Ruth Hampton, an official at the Department of the Interior. He said that the photograph showed that the policemen were not shooting at the uniformed Nationalists (Cadets), but at a terrified crowd in full flight. Investigation and the Hays Commission former Spanish Army barracks in Ponce, Puerto Rico (December 1937). Initial investigations of the event differed on whether the police or the marchers fired the first shots. Governor Winship applied pressure on the district attorney's office in charge of the investigation. He requested that the public prosecutor from Ponce, Rafael P√©rez Marchand, \\"arrest more Nationalists\\", and that no charges be filed against the police. The prosecutor resigned as a result of being denied the opportunity to conduct a proper investigation. A Puerto Rican government investigation into the incident drew few conclusions. A second, independent investigation ordered by the United States Commission on Civil Rights led by the ACLU's Arthur Garfield Hays, together with Puerto Rican citizens Fulgencio Pi√±ero, Emilio Belaval, Jos√© Davila Rice, Antonio Ayuyo Valdivieso, Manuel D√≠az Garc√≠a, and Francisco M. Zeno took place. This investigation concluded that the events on 21 March constituted a massacre and mob action by the police. The report harshly criticized the repressive tactics and massive civil rights violations by Governor Winship. After viewing the photograph taken by Carlos Torres Morales, Hays in his report to the American Civil Liberties Union questioned why the governor's investigation had not used the photography, which was among two that were widely published. According to Hays, the photograph clearly showed 18 armed policeman at the corner of Aurora and Marina streets, ready to fire upon a group of innocent bystanders.Ruby A. Black. \\"Ponce Massacre\\" Report is Before Senate Committee: Describes Men, Women and Children Being Shot in Back, Clubbed to Death by Island Police\\", Oshkosh Daily Northwestern, 19 June 1937, pg. 3. The image showed the white smoke in the barrel of a policeman's revolver as he fired upon the unarmed people. The Hays Commission questioned why the policemen fired directly at the crowd, and not at the Nationalist Cadets. Casualties Relatives of those killed in the Ponce massacre standing by the police bullet-ridden wall at the Nationalist Party headquarters in Ponce. The following are the names of those killed: Aftermath Lack of convictions In the aftermath of the massacre, no police officer was convicted or sentenced to jail. No police were demoted or suspended and Governor Winship never issued a public apology. Reaction in the U.S. Congress The Ponce massacre reverberated through the U.S. Congress. On the House floor, Congressman John T. Bernard expressed his shock and outrage. He said: \\"The police in Ponce, probably with the encouragement of the North American police chief and even the governor, opened fire on a Palm Sunday Nationalist march, killing seventeen and wounding more than two hundred.\\"Extension of Remarks of the Honorable Congressman John T. Bernard of Minnesota in the Congressional Record, 75th Congress, 1st Sessiondate=14 April 1937volume=81pages=934‚Äì936 Congressman Vito Marcantonio joined in the criticism, filing charges against Governor Winship with President Roosevelt. In his speech before Congress titled \\"Five Years of Tyranny\\", Congressman Vito Marcantonio reported that \\"Ex-Governor Blanton Winship, of Puerto Rico, was summarily removed by the President of the United States on May 12, 1939\\" after charges were filed against Mr. Winship with the President. In his speech, the Congressman detailed the number of killings by the police and added, \\"the facts show that the affair of March 21 in Ponce was a massacre ... Governor Winship tried to cover up this massacre by filing a mendacious report\\" and the congressman called Governor Winship a \\"tyrant\\". Attempt on Governor Winship's life The year following the Ponce massacre, on 25 July 1938, Governor Winship wanted to mark the anniversary of the US 1898 invasion of Puerto Rico with a military parade. He chose the city of Ponce to demonstrate that his \\"Law and Order\\" policy had been successful against the Nationalists. During the parade, shots were fired at the grandstand where Winship and his officials were sitting in an attempt to assassinate him. It was the first time that an attempt was made on the life of a Governor of Puerto Rico. Winship escaped unharmed but two men were killed, and 36 people were wounded. The dead included the Nationalist √Ångel Esteban Antongiorgi and National Guard Colonel Luis Irizarry. The Nationalist Party denied participation in the attack, but the government arrested several Nationalists and accused nine of \\"murder and conspiracy to incite violence.\\" Among the nine Nationalists charged and convicted were Tom√°s L√≥pez de Victoria, captain of the Ponce branch of the Cadets of the Republic, and fellow cadets Elifaz Escobar, Santiago Gonz√°lez Castro, Juan Pietri and Prudencio Segarra. They served eight years in the Puerto Rico State Penitentiary. The four were pardoned by the next full-term US-appointed governor, Rexford Guy Tugwell. Winship tried to repress the Nationalists. Jaime Ben√≠tez Rexach, a student at the University of Chicago at the time and later long-time chancellor of the University of Puerto Rico, wrote to President Roosevelt stating, \\"Governor [Winship] himself through his military approach to things has helped keep Puerto Rico in a unnecessary state of turmoil. He seems to think that the political problem of Puerto Rico limits itself to a fight between himself and the Nationalists, that no holds are barred in that fight and that everybody else should keep out.\\" Winship was replaced in 1939. Puerto Rican Civil Liberties Association The Ponce Massacre Museum in Ponce A major consequence of the Ponce shootings and the Hayes Commission was the creation in Puerto Rico of a chapter of the ACLU on 21 May 1937. It was named Asociaci√≥n Puertorrique√±a de Libertades Civiles (Puerto Rican Association of Civil Liberties). Its first president was Dr. Tom√°s Blanco, attorneys Felipe Col√≥n D√≠az and Dr. Antonio Fern√≥s-Isern were its vice-presidents, the treasurer was In√©s Mendoza, the Secretary was attorney Vicente G√©igel Polanco, and the association's legal counsel was attorney Ernesto Ramos Antonini. Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n and many leaders from Ponce, including attorney P√©rez Marchand and some of the members of the Hayes Commission, were also among the founders. Legacy Today, the Ponce massacre is commemorated annually. Ponce Massacre Museum The Institute of Puerto Rican Culture, an agency of the Government of Puerto Rico, operates the Ponce Massacre Museum. It is located at the intersection where the events took place (corner of Marina and Aurora streets). The museum houses photographs and various artifacts from the Ponce massacre.

Situated on the western edge of Warwickshire near the border with Worcestershire it is southeast of Redditch and northwest of Stratford-upon-Avon. The Roman road of Ryknild Street, now the A435, passes through the village on its eastern edge, parallel to the River Arrow. The name derives from the Old English leah, being a meadow or pasture, where horses, stod, are kept. Studley is sometimes claimed to be the largest village in England, however, this is incorrect as it is not even the largest village in Warwickshire. Although Polesworth and Bulkington are larger, by population, they could be classed as a suburban. The United Kingdom Census 2001 reported Studley's population as being 6,624, decreasing to 5,879 at the 2011 Census.  History  The manor of Studley is recorded twice in the Domesday Book mostly as part of the lands of William son of Courbucion; who was appointed Sheriff of Warwick soon after 1086; where it reads, \\"In Ferncombe Hundred in Stodlei (Studley) 4 hides. Land for 11 ploughs. In lordship 2; 3 slaves. 19 villagers with a priest and 12 smallholders have 9 ploughs. A mill at 5s; meadow, 24 acres; a salt house which pays 19 packloads of salt; woodland 1 league long and ¬Ω a league wide. The value was and is 100s. Swein held it freely.\\" A further holding is listed as part of the land of William Bonavallet \\"William holds 1 hide in Stodlei from William. Land for 2 ploughs. In lordship 1 plough. Meadow 4 acres; woodland 3 furlongs long and 2 furlongs wide. Value 10s. Godric held it freely.\\"Domesday Book for Warwickshire, Phillimore edited by John Morris It is the site of both a castle, not the 19th-century house called Studley Castle, and the remains of a medieval priory. The Augustinian priory was founded in the 12th century by Peter CorbizunWilliam Dugdale, The Antiquities of Warwickshire, 1656 but was closed at the dissolution under Henry VIII and was used as a source of stone for other local buildings. Nothing remains today apart from the use of the name priory in a few local building names such as Priory Farm, which now much modernised, embodies a few fragmentary portions of a conventual building. A gabled west wall of stone rubble contains the remains of a large 14th-century window. A few medieval sculptured fragments are built on to the walls.A History of the County of Warwick: Volume 3: Barlichway hundred (1945), pp. 175-187. URL: http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=57007  Economy  Studley is also known for being the site of a sewing needle and surgical needle making industry. This specialisation started when Elizabeth I permitted a number of Huguenot refugees to settle here, bringing this rare craft with them. From the 19th century, precision-made surgical needles were in demand, and, with advances in manufacturing technology, such was the demand that over 3,000 workers were employed. In 1977 the old factory where needles were made was burnt down, and the production of \\"Aero\\" needles moved to a nearby site. The original factory site now contains a supermarket, other retail outlets, and housing. One of the streets in the village is named \\"Crooks Lane\\", ostensibly because the crooked needles from the original factory were dumped at the end of this lane, but the road was there before the village had a needle factory. Governance Studley is a ward of Stratford on Avon District Council and represented by Councillors Justin kerridge, Conservative and Hazel Wright, Liberal Democrat. Nationally it is part of Stratford-on-Avon (UK Parliament constituency), whose current Member of Parliament is Nadhim Zahawi of the Conservative Party. It is included in the West Midlands electoral region of the European Parliament, following the 2014 elections the seven members are; Philip Bradbourn OBE, (who died in December 2014) and Anthea McIntyre (Conservative), Neena Gill and Sion Simon (Labour) and Jim Carver, Bill Etheridge and Jill Seymour (UK Independence). Geography Studley is surrounded on the north, east and west by hills rising to about 500 ft. The River Arrow flows across the south-west corner, through flat ground, but the country north and east of the brook is for the most part undulating and well wooded. The main village lies on the west bank of the river, along the Roman Rykneild Way, which is now the A435, Alcester-Birmingham main road. The fact that the church and the site of the castle are about half a mile away on the opposite side of the river indicates that the original settlement was, at some distance from the Roman road. At Washford, half a mile north of Studley village, the main road bears right from the Rykneild Street and continues through the hamlet of Mappleborough Green and up Gorcott Hill, which marks the northern extremity of the parish. The Rykneild Street (which between Washford and Ipsley diverges considerably from its original line) was, until the end of the 18th century, the main road to Birmingham; the present road between Spernall Ash (on the southern boundary of Studley parish) and Digbeth in Birmingham was turnpiked by an Act of 1721. Notable buildings Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Studley, Warwickshire The parish church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin consists of a chancel, nave, south aisle and west tower. It features a 12th-century north wall and window of Norman date, fine surviving examples of opus spicatum or herringbone masonry, a medieval rood screen, Elizabethan era table and dug out chest, Jacobean era pulpit and brasses and other points of interest.Old Warwickshire Churches, W Hobart Bird 1936 The survey of the clergy by the puritans in 1586 described the then vicar, Thomas Penford as; \\"dumbe & vnlearned, a verie aged man, he can scarce reade, yet he hath learning enough for 2 benefices ; for he reapeth the fruite of Studley & Coughton both, he hath of late gotten him a certaine hireling to serue his turne at both places, one Robt.

As well as boasting a number of football teams, including Studley BKL and Studley Juniors, founded a few years ago by Kevin Sanders and Mike Imms, (formed when the Redditch United Youth Teams broke away and were taken on by Studley BKL), the village also gives its name to Studley Musical Theatre and Operatic group which has been going for over 100 years. They perform twice a year, once in April in a spring show, performing Oliver in 2010 and Fiddler on the Roof in April 2011 and a summer concert. Just outside the village on the Birmingham road is Studley Cricket Club, home to a thriving social and sports club, members of the Birmingham and District Premier League, (top of the regional midlands structure). The club is open all year round with a growing social membership and has relaunched its junior section for 2011. There is also a large mixed sports and social club in Eldorado Close (Studley Sports & Social Club, commonly known as the Entaco). This is home to a number of football teams across its 2 pitches, as well as being one of the bases of Redditch Entaco Cricket Club. The club also sports a number of tennis courts and a high quality bowling green, whilst the clubhouse boasts a large function room and is the base for a number of other local clubs and charities to hold their meetings alongside its established social memberships.

Aircraft engine controls are also considered as flight controls as they change speed. The fundamentals of aircraft controls are explained in flight dynamics. This article centers on the operating mechanisms of the flight controls. The basic system in use on aircraft first appeared in a readily recognizable form as early as April 1908, on Louis Bl√©riot's Bl√©riot VIII pioneer-era monoplane design. Cockpit controls  Primary controls  instrument panel of a Cessna 182D Skylane Generally, the primary cockpit flight controls are arranged as follows:Langewiesche, Wolfgang. Stick and Rudder: An Explanation of the Art of Flying, McGraw-Hill Professional, 1990, , . * a control yoke (also known as a control column), centre stick or side-stick (the latter two also colloquially known as a control or joystick), governs the aircraft's roll and pitch by moving the ailerons (or activating wing warping on some very early aircraft designs) when turned or deflected left and right, and moves the elevators when moved backwards or forwards * rudder pedals, or the earlier, pre-1919 \\"rudder bar\\", to control yaw, which move the rudder; left foot forward will move the rudder left for instance. * throttle controls to control engine speed or thrust for powered aircraft. The control yokes also vary greatly amongst aircraft. There are yokes where roll is controlled by rotating the yoke clockwise/counterclockwise (like steering a car) and pitch is controlled by tilting the control column towards you or away from you, but in others the pitch is controlled by sliding the yoke into and out of the instrument panel (like most Cessnas, such as the 152 and 172), and in some the roll is controlled by sliding the whole yoke to the left and right (like the Cessna 162). Centre sticks also vary between aircraft. Some are directly connected to the control surfaces using cables, others (fly-by-wire airplanes) have a computer in between which then controls the electrical actuators. Bl√©riot VIII at Issy-les-Moulineaux, the first flightworthy aircraft design to have the initial form of modern flight controls for the pilot Even when an aircraft uses variant flight control surfaces such as a V-tail ruddervator, flaperons, or elevons, to avoid pilot confusion the aircraft's flight control system will still be designed so that the stick or yoke controls pitch and roll conventionally, as will the rudder pedals for yaw. The basic pattern for modern flight controls was pioneered by French aviation figure Robert Esnault- Pelterie, with fellow French aviator Louis Bl√©riot popularizing Esnault- Pelterie's control format initially on Louis' Bl√©riot VIII monoplane in April 1908, and standardizing the format on the July 1909 Channel-crossing Bl√©riot XI. Flight control has long been taught in such fashion for many decades, as popularized in ab initio instructional books such as the 1944 work Stick and Rudder. In some aircraft, the control surfaces are not manipulated with a linkage. In ultralight aircraft and motorized hang gliders, for example, there is no mechanism at all. Instead, the pilot just grabs the lifting surface by hand (using a rigid frame that hangs from its underside) and moves it. Secondary controls In addition to the primary flight controls for roll, pitch, and yaw, there are often secondary controls available to give the pilot finer control over flight or to ease the workload. The most commonly available control is a wheel or other device to control elevator trim, so that the pilot does not have to maintain constant backward or forward pressure to hold a specific pitch attitudeThom,1988. p. 87. (other types of trim, for rudder and ailerons, are common on larger aircraft but may also appear on smaller ones). Many aircraft have wing flaps, controlled by a switch or a mechanical lever or in some cases are fully automatic by computer control, which alter the shape of the wing for improved control at the slower speeds used for take-off and landing. Other secondary flight control systems may be available, including slats, spoilers, air brakes and variable-sweep wings. Flight control systems Mechanical de Havilland Tiger Moth elevator and rudder cables Mechanical or manually operated flight control systems are the most basic method of controlling an aircraft. They were used in early aircraft and are currently used in small aircraft where the aerodynamic forces are not excessive. Very early aircraft, such as the Wright Flyer I, Bl√©riot XI and Fokker Eindecker used a system of wing warping where no conventionally hinged control surfaces were used on the wing, and sometimes not even for pitch control as on the Wright Flyer I and original versions of the 1909 Etrich Taube, which only had a hinged/pivoting rudder in addition to the warping- operated pitch and roll controls.Taylor, 1990. p. 116. A manual flight control system uses a collection of mechanical parts such as pushrods, tension cables, pulleys, counterweights, and sometimes chains to transmit the forces applied to the cockpit controls directly to the control surfaces. Turnbuckles are often used to adjust control cable tension. The Cessna Skyhawk is a typical example of an aircraft that uses this type of system. Gust locks are often used on parked aircraft with mechanical systems to protect the control surfaces and linkages from damage from wind. Some aircraft have gust locks fitted as part of the control system.Thom,1988. p. 153. Increases in the control surface area required by large aircraft or higher loads caused by high airspeeds in small aircraft lead to a large increase in the forces needed to move them, consequently complicated mechanical gearing arrangements were developed to extract maximum mechanical advantage in order to reduce the forces required from the pilots.Taylor, 1990. p. 118. This arrangement can be found on bigger or higher performance propeller aircraft such as the Fokker 50. Some mechanical flight control systems use servo tabs that provide aerodynamic assistance. Servo tabs are small surfaces hinged to the control surfaces. The flight control mechanisms move these tabs, aerodynamic forces in turn move, or assist the movement of the control surfaces reducing the amount of mechanical forces needed. This arrangement was used in early piston-engined transport aircraft and in early jet transports.Thom,1988. p. 86. The Boeing 737 incorporates a system, whereby in the unlikely event of total hydraulic system failure, it automatically and seamlessly reverts to being controlled via servo-tab. Hydro-mechanical The complexity and weight of mechanical flight control systems increase considerably with the size and performance of the aircraft. Hydraulically powered control surfaces help to overcome these limitations. With hydraulic flight control systems, the aircraft's size and performance are limited by economics rather than a pilot's muscular strength. At first, only-partially boosted systems were used in which the pilot could still feel some of the aerodynamic loads on the control surfaces (feedback). A hydro-mechanical flight control system has two parts: *The mechanical circuit, which links the cockpit controls with the hydraulic circuits. Like the mechanical flight control system, it consists of rods, cables, pulleys, and sometimes chains. *The hydraulic circuit, which has hydraulic pumps, reservoirs, filters, pipes, valves and actuators. The actuators are powered by the hydraulic pressure generated by the pumps in the hydraulic circuit. The actuators convert hydraulic pressure into control surface movements. The electro-hydraulic servo valves control the movement of the actuators. The pilot's movement of a control causes the mechanical circuit to open the matching servo valve in the hydraulic circuit. The hydraulic circuit powers the actuators which then move the control surfaces. As the actuator moves, the servo valve is closed by a mechanical feedback linkage - one that stops movement of the control surface at the desired position. This arrangement was found in the older-designed jet transports and in some high-performance aircraft. Examples include the Antonov An-225 and the Lockheed SR-71. =Artificial feel devices= With purely mechanical flight control systems, the aerodynamic forces on the control surfaces are transmitted through the mechanisms and are felt directly by the pilot, allowing tactile feedback of airspeed. With hydromechanical flight control systems, however, the load on the surfaces cannot be felt and there is a risk of overstressing the aircraft through excessive control surface movement. To overcome this problem, artificial feel systems can be used. For example, for the controls of the RAF's Avro Vulcan jet bomber and the RCAF's Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow supersonic interceptor (both 1950s-era designs), the required force feedback was achieved by a spring device.The Arrowheads, pages 57-58, 83-85 (for CF-105 Arrow only). The fulcrum of this device was moved in proportion to the square of the air speed (for the elevators) to give increased resistance at higher speeds. For the controls of the American Vought F-8 Crusader and the LTV A-7 Corsair II warplanes, a 'bob-weight' was used in the pitch axis of the control stick, giving force feedback that was proportional to the airplane's normal acceleration. =Stick shaker= A stick shaker is a device (available in some hydraulic aircraft) that is attached to the control column, which shakes the control column when the aircraft is about to stall. Also in some aircraft like the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 there is/was a back-up electrical power supply that the pilot can turn on to re-activate the stick shaker in case the hydraulic connection to the stick shaker is lost. =Power-by-wire= In most current systems the power is provided to the control actuators by high- pressure hydraulic systems. In fly-by-wire systems the valves, which control these systems, are activated by electrical signals. In power-by-wire systems, the power is carried to the actuators by electrical cables. These are lighter than hydraulic pipes, easier to install and maintain, and more reliable. Elements of the F-35 flight control system are power-by-wire. The actuators in such an electro-hydrostatic actuation (EHA) system are self-contained hydraulic devices, small closed-circuit hydraulic systems. The overall aim is towards more- or all-electric aircraft and an early example of the approach was the Avro Vulcan. Serious consideration was given to using the approach on the Airbus A380. Fly-by-wire control systems A fly-by-wire (FBW) system replaces manual flight control of an aircraft with an electronic interface. The movements of flight controls are converted to electronic signals transmitted by wires (hence the term fly-by-wire), and flight control computers determine how to move the actuators at each control surface to provide the expected response. Commands from the computers are also input without the pilot's knowledge to stabilize the aircraft and perform other tasks. Electronics for aircraft flight control systems are part of the field known as avionics. Fly-by-optics, also known as fly-by-light, is a further development using fiber optic cables. Research Several technology research and development efforts exist to integrate the functions of flight control systems such as ailerons, elevators, elevons, flaps, and flaperons into wings to perform the aerodynamic purpose with the advantages of less: mass, cost, drag, inertia (for faster, stronger control response), complexity (mechanically simpler, fewer moving parts or surfaces, less maintenance), and radar cross section for stealth. These may be used in many unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and 6th generation fighter aircraft. Two promising approaches are flexible wings, and fluidics. Flexible wings In flexible wings, much or all of a wing surface can change shape in flight to deflect air flow much like an ornithopter. Adaptive compliant wings are a military and commercial effort. The X-53 Active Aeroelastic Wing was a US Air Force, NASA, and Boeing effort. Active Flow Control In active flow control, forces in vehicles occur via circulation control, in which larger more complex mechanical parts are replaced by smaller simpler fluidic systems (slots which emit air flows) where larger forces in fluids are diverted by smaller jets or flows of fluid intermittently, to change the direction of vehicles. In this use, active flow control promises simplicity and lower mass, costs (up to half less), and inertia and response times. This was demonstrated in the Demon UAV, which flew for the first time, in the UK, in September 2010.

History Royal Marine Commandos attached to 3rd Division move inland from Sword Beach on the Normandy coast, 6 June 1944. 5th RM Battalion The 5th RM Battalion was originally raised for a brief period at the end of World War I (September 1918-February 1919), and was again raised on 2 April 1940 following mass mobilisation and the influx of \\"hostilities only\\" (HO) marines. The battalion was raised at Cowshot Camp in Brookwood (now part of the Pirbright Camp complex), being incorporated into 101 RM Bde, along with the 1st RM Battalion. Between August and October 1940 the battalion took part in operations in Dakar. On return until August 1943 the battalion conducted extensive training in Wales, Scotland, the Isle of Wight and Burley, where the battalion reformed as 45 RM Commando on 1 August 1943. It was commanded between March 1940 and February 1942 by Arnold Reading. 45 RM Commando After reforming and retitling, the unit transitioned to the Commando role as a formed unit, by- passing the individual volunteer and selection process undertaken by Army Commando candidates. Personnel undertook, and completed, the Commando Basic Training Course at Achnacarry, Scotland. As part of the 1st Special Service Brigade, the Commando participated in Operation Overlord (the D-Day Normandy landings), before going on to move through Europe into Germany, including Brachterbeek on 23 January 1945. During the Ardennes Offensive, the retitled 1st Commando Brigade was given the task of holding a stretch of the River Meuse; it was during this period of operations that Lance Corporal H. Harden, a medical orderly of the RAMC attached to 45 (RM) Commando, won the Victoria Cross. Post-World War II reorganisation Following the Second World War both 1st Commando Brigade (Nos 3, 4 and 6 Army Commandos and 45 RM Commando) and 2nd Commando Brigade (Nos 2 and 9 Army Cdos and 40 and 43 RM Cdos) disbanded, leaving 3 Cdo Bde (then comprising 1 and 5 Army Cdos and 42 and 44 RM Cdos) in place in the Far East. 3 Cdo Bde reorganised, disbanding 1 and 5 Army Cdos, and took on 45 RM Cdo, which joined the Bde in Hong Kong, from the UK, in January 1946. In order to preserve the heritage of a 2 Cdo Bde unit, as well as that of 1 Cdo Bde (45 RM Cdo), 44 Commando was retitled 40 Commando (which had been disbanded in UK in October 1945) and took on 40 RM Cdo's colours, battle honours and traditions, albeit with 44 RM Cdo's manpower. The three remaining commandos were restyled 40, 42 and 45 Commandos RM in March 1946. 1940s/1950s Royal Navy Westland Whirlwind helicopters taking the first men of 45 Royal Marine Commando into action at Port Said from HMS Theseus. The Commando unit was based in Hong Kong between January 1946 and May 1947, conducting internal security duties, as part of 3 Cdo Bde RM. Between May 1947 and December 1948 the Commando moved to Malta, during which time it deployed to Libya, Palestine, Suez and Jordan. The Commando unit returned to Hong Kong in December 1948 and from there deployed to Malaya between 1950 and 1952 taking part in operations during the Emergency. Between 1952 and 1959 the Commando was once again based in Malta. In September 1955 45 Commando was deployed to Cyprus to undertake anti-terrorist operations against the EOKA guerrillas during tensions between the Greek and Turkish inhabitants of the island. The EOKA were a small, but powerful organisation of Greek Cypriots, who had great local support from the Greek community. The unit travelled to the Kyrenia mountain area of the island and in December 1955 launched Operation Foxhunter, an operation to destroy EOKA's main base.French, p. 134 Then in 1956 the unit deployed to Egypt as part of the response to the Suez Crisis, conducting the first helicopter assault in history. 1960s Between 1960 and 1967 the Commando was based in Aden, from where it conducted 10 operational tours in the Radfan during the Aden Emergency. The Commando unit also deployed briefly to Kuwait following an Iraqi threat to her Independence in 1961. In January 1964, part of the Tanzanian Army mutinied. Within 24 hours elements of 45 Commando had left Bickleigh Camp, Plymouth, Devon, and were travelling by air to Nairobi, Kenya, continuing by road into Tanzania. At the same time, Commandos aboard HMS Bulwark sailed to East Africa and anchored off-shore from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The revolt was put down and the next six months were spent in touring Tanzanian military out-posts disarming military personnel. The last elements of the Commando left Aden on 29 November 1967 to return to the UK for the first time since the end of World War II. They set up home in Stonehouse Barracks, Plymouth. 1970s/1980s In 1970 the Commando began Arctic training for the first time, taking on the role of Britain's mountain and Arctic warfare experts (joined later by the other Commandos). 45 Cdo RM deployed to Norway for the first of many winters in 1971, which coincided with a move of the unit from Stonehouse, Plymouth to the old Naval Air Station, RNAS Arbroath (now RM Condor) in Arbroath, Scotland, where the unit still remains. This period in the unit's history is characterised by the alternation of Northern Ireland tours and winters in Norway, protecting NATO's northern flank.Fowler, p. 25 =Falklands War= Following the Argentine invasion of 2 April 1982, 45 Cdo RM, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Andrew F. Whitehead RM, had their Easter leave cancelled and hastily deployed to the Falklands, travelling in a mix of Royal Navy (RN) and Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) ships. Having made a tactical landing at Red Beach, Ajax Bay on 21 May 1982, the men of 45 Cdo RM yomped across East Falkland, via Port San Carlos, New House, Douglas Settlement, Teal Inlet and Mount Kent to take part in the Battle for Port Stanley. They conducted a night attack on the Two Sisters feature over the 11/12 June 1982, during which the Commando unit lost 8 men killed and 17 wounded. The Argentinians surrendered on 14 June 1982. Lt. Col Whitehead was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). 1990s A British Royal Marine from 45 Commando watches for enemy tanks and armoured personnel carriers from behind his anti-armour weapon as part of Combined Joint Task Force Exercise '96. The Commando unit deployed to Northern Iraq on Operation Haven at the end of the Gulf War, where it spent 2 months in the Zakho area, withdrawing at the end of June. In 1993 The Commando unit was deployed to Belize for the last operational jungle tour in that country. In a mirror image of its 1961 deployment to Kuwait, the Commando returned on Operation Driver in 1994, in support of Kuwait, following some threatening troop movements by the Iraqis on their side of the border. In 1998 the Commando unit was redirected from an exercise in Belize, to assist Nicaragua and Honduras following the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch. 2000s Ground crew with the Commando Helicopter Force huddle from the downwash of a Sea King helicopter on exercise in Norway.

At the turn of the Millennium, the Commando unit was deployed to Kosovo under KFOR as part of 3 Cdo Bde RM on Operation Agricola IV. From April 2002, the unit deployed to Afghanistan on Operation Jacana, and also took part in Operation Telic 1, the 2003 invasion of Iraq. X-Ray Company Group was attached to the Special Boat Service (SBS), Whiskey Company Group attached to the Special Air Service (SAS). In September 2003, 45 Commando was granted the Freedom of Angus in recognition of their service in Iraq and Afghanistan and contribution to the local economy of Arbroath, where they are based. In January 2004 the unit deployed to Northern Ireland (Operation Banner) for 6 months in support of peacekeeping operations, returning home in June. On return, it became the Spearhead Lead Commando, a role assumed on a rotational basis. The Lead Commando is at a high level of readiness, able to deploy at short notice on operations worldwide.Ministry of Defence annual report 2005-2006 In September 2004, whilst still Lead Commando unit, the Group deployed to the United States on Exercise BLACKHORSE. This was split into two phases, the first of which took place with the United States Marines Corps Ground-Air Combat Centre at 29 Palms, California. This 900 square miles of desert, allowed realistic live firing, involving artillery and air strikes. The second phase took place at the Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Centre, high in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. An early snowfall meant the Commando was able to carry out cold weather warfare training, operating between 7000 and . 2006 saw the Unit deploy to Norway for further Arctic training which culminated with a NATO led exercise. The focus switched to preparation for deploying to Afghanistan on Operation HERRICK 5 in late 2006. This deployment saw the Commando take on a number of different roles, the principal one being that of the Operational Mentoring and Liaison Team (OMLT). The OMLT task was to work alongside the Afghan National Army and develop it into a self-sufficient organisation. The Unit returned from Afghanistan in April 2007. October 2008 saw the Commando unit return to Afghanistan as Northern Battle Group in Helmand Province on Operation HERRICK 9. The operational area of responsibility was the Upper Sangin Valley which extended for 80 km along the length of the Helmand River. The Battle Group was in excess of 1200 strong, half of whom came from 45 Commando. April/May 2009 saw the return of the Commando to Arbroath in Scotland for reorganisation ahead of a winter deployment to Norway to practice cold weather and amphibious tactics. 2010s 45 Commando deployed to Afghanistan again, as part of 3 Commando Brigade, for 6 months in March 2011 on Operation Herrick 14.

The word gaberdine or gabardine has been used to refer to a particular item of clothing, a sort of long cassock but often open at the front, since at least the 15th century, in the 16th becoming used for outer garments of the poor. Etymology The modern use of the term for a fabric rather than a garment dates to Thomas Burberry, who invented the fabric & revived the name in 1879, and patented it in 1888. It has been used with a general meaning of \\"closely woven cloth\\" since at least 1904. Although its origin is unknown, the word may be related to the word kaba, a type of coat reaching to the knees with wide sleeves worn by Muslim men in Puraniya, a region of India. There is another kind of coat, called a qabƒÅ, that is mentioned in Sufƒ´ scripture, which is an ordinary coat, as opposed to a religious coat. Fabric The fibre used to make the fabric is traditionally worsted wool, but may also be cotton, texturised polyester, or a blend. Gabardine is woven as a warp-faced steep or regular twill, with a prominent diagonal rib on the face and smooth surface on the back. Gabardine always has many more warp than weft yarns.Kadolph (2007), pp. 240, 472Cumming (2010), p. 248.Picken (1957), p. 145 Cotton gabardine is often used by bespoke tailors to make pocket linings for business suits, where the pockets' contents would quickly wear holes in flimsy pocket lining material. Clothing made from gabardine is generally labelled as being suitable for dry cleaning only, as is typical for wool textiles. Gabardine may also refer to the twill-weave used for gabardine fabric, or to a raincoat made of this fabric. History Gabardine was invented in 1879 by Thomas Burberry, founder of the Burberry fashion house in Basingstoke, Hampshire, England and patented in 1888. The original fabric was worsted wool or worsted wool in combination with cotton, and was waterproofed using lanolin[Royal Society of Chemistry] before weaving. It was tightly woven and water-repellent but more comfortable than rubberised fabrics. The fabric takes its name from the word \\"gaberdine\\", originally a long, loose cloak or gown worn in the Middle Ages, but later signifying a rain cloak or protective smock-frock.Cumming (2010), p. 88. Burberry clothing of gabardine was worn by polar explorers, including Roald Amundsen, the first man to reach the South Pole, in 1911 and Ernest Shackleton, who led a 1914 expedition to cross Antarctica. A jacket made of this material was worn by George Mallory on his ill-fated attempt on Mount Everest in 1924.\\"Replica clothes pass Everest test\\". BBC News. Gabardine was also used widely in the 1950s to produce colourful patterned casual jackets, trousers and suits. Companies like J. C. Penney, Sport Chief, Campus, Four Star and California Trends were all producing short-waisted jackets, sometimes reversible, commonly known as weekender jackets.

Throughout his life, Mattick continually criticised Bolshevism, Vladimir Lenin and Leninist organisational methods, describing their political legacy as \\"serving as a mere ideology to justify the rise of modified capitalist (state-capitalist) systems, which were [...] controlled by way of an authoritarian state\\".  Early life  Born in Pomerania in 1904 and raised in Berlin by class-conscious parents, Mattick was already at the age of 14 a member of the Spartacists' Freie Sozialistische Jugend. In 1918, he started to study as a toolmaker at Siemens AG, where he was also elected as the apprentices' delegate on the workers' council of the company during the German Revolution. Implicated in many actions during the revolution, arrested several times and threatened with death, Mattick radicalized along the left and oppositional trend of the German communists. After the \\"Heidelberg\\" split of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD; a successor to the Spartacist League) and the formation for the Communist Workers Party of Germany (KAPD) in the spring of 1920, he entered the KAPD and worked in the youth organization Rote Jugend, writing for its journal. In March 1920 he participated in street fighting against the rightist Kapp Putsch, in which his lifelong friend Reinhold Klingenberg was shot and lost a leg.Roth, Gary. Marxism in A Lost Century: A Biography of Paul Mattick, (Brill, 2014), p. 27. In 1921, at the age of 17, Mattick moved to Cologne to find work with Klockner for a while, until strikes, insurrections and a new arrest destroyed every prospect of employment. He was active as an organizer and agitator in the KAPD and the AAU in the Cologne region, where he got to know Jan Appel among others. He also established contacts with intellectuals, writers and artists working in the AAUE founded by Otto R√ºhle. These included the Cologne Progressives, a group formed around Franz Seiwert. With the continuing decline of radical mass struggle and revolutionary hopes, especially after 1923, and having been unemployed for a number of years, Mattick emigrated to the United States in 1926, whilst still maintaining contacts with the KAPD and the AAUE in Germany.  In the United States  In the United States, Mattick carried through a more systematic theoretical study, above all of Karl Marx. In addition, the publication of Henryk Grossman's principal work, Das Akkumulations - und Zusammenbruchsgesetz des Kapitalistischen Systems (1929), played a fundamental role for Mattick, as Grossman brought Marx's theory of accumulation, which had been completely forgotten, back to the centre of debate in the workers' movement. To Mattick, Marx's \\"critique of political economy\\" became not a purely theoretical matter but rather directly connected to his own revolutionary practice. From this time, Mattick focused on Marx's theory of capitalist development and its inner logic of contradictions inevitably growing to crisis as the foundation of all political thoughts within the workers' movement. Towards the end of the 1920s, Mattick had moved to Chicago, where he first tried to unite the different German workers' organisations. Taking night classes to improve his English, Mattick fell into the orbit of the Proletarian Party, a cliquish grouping of independent Marxists which had been successively drummed out of the Socialist Party (in 1919) and the Communist Party (in 1920), now going it alone with their own party organization. Mattick participated in their meetings and contributed to their party publications for several years, during which he also sometimes spoke in the nighttime lecture series at the bohemian Dil Pickle Club, an IWW hangout.Roth, Gary. Marxism in a Lost Century, (Brill, 2014), p. 134. In 1931, under the sponsorship of a local federation of German- speaking socialist clubs and sports groups, he took over as editor of the defunct German-language Chicagoer Arbeiter-Zeitung, a newspaper steeped in radical tradition and at one time edited by August Spies and Joseph Dietzgen. Mattick put out 10 monthly issues between February and December 1931, writing much of the paper's content himself, but the paper failed to achieve a large enough readership to be self-sustaining, and folded at the end of the year.Roth, Gary. Marxism in a Lost Century. For a period, he joined the Industrial Workers of the World (known as the IWW or Wobblies), who were the only revolutionary union organization existing in America that, in spite of national or sectoral differences, assembled all workers in One Big Union, so as to prepare the general strike to bring down capitalism. However, the golden age of the Wobblies' militant strikes had already passed by the beginning of the thirties, and only the emerging unemployed movement again gave the IWW a brief regional development. In 1933, Paul Mattick drafted a programme for the IWW trying to give the Wobblies a more solid 'Marxist' foundation based on Grossman's theory, although it did not improve the organization's condition. In 1934, Mattick, some friends from the IWW as well as some expellees from the Leninist Proletarian Party formed the United Workers Party, later to be renamed Group of Council Communists. The group kept close contacts with the remaining small groups of the German/Dutch Left communism in Europe and published the journal International Council Correspondence, which through the 1930s became an Anglo-American parallel to the R√§tekorrespondenz of the Dutch GIC(H). Articles and debates from Europe were translated along with economic analysis and critical political comments of current issues in the United States and elsewhere in the world. Apart from his own factory work, Mattick organized not only most of the review's technical work but was also the author of the greater part of the contributions which appeared in it. Among the few willing to offer regular contributions was Karl Korsch, with whom Mattick had come into contact in 1935 and who remained a personal friend for many years from the time of his emigration to the United States at the end of 1936. As European council communism went underground and formally \\"disappeared\\" in the second half of the 1930s, Mattick changed Correspondence's name from 1938 to Living Marxism and from 1942 to New Essays. Like Karl Korsch and Henryk Grossman, Mattick had some contact with Max Horkheimer's Institut fur Sozialforschung (the later Frankfurt School). In 1936, Mattick wrote a major sociological study on the American unemployed movement for the Institute, although it remained in the Institute's files, to be published only in 1969 by the SDS publishing house Neue Kritik.  World War II and after  After the United States' entry into World War II and the post-war Mccarthyism, the left in America experienced repression. Mattick retired at the beginning of the 1950s to the countryside, as part of the rustic \\"back to the land\\" colony clustered around Scott Nearing near Winhall, Vermont, where he managed to survive through occasional jobs and his activity as a writer. In the postwar development Mattick took part in only small and occasional political activities, writing small articles for various periodicals from time to time. From the forties and up through the fifties, Mattick went through a study of John Maynard Keynes and compiled a series of critical notes and articles against Keynesian theory and practice. In this work, he developed Marx's and Grossman's theory of capitalist development further to meet the new phenomena and appearances of the modern capitalism critically. With the general changes of the political scene and the re-emergence of more radical thoughts in the sixties, Paul Mattick made some more elaborated and important political contributions. One main work was Marx and Keynes: The Limits of Mixed Economy from 1969, which was translated into several languages and had quite an influence in the post-1968 student movement. Another important work was Critique of Herbert Marcuse: The one-dimensional man in class society, in which Mattick forcefully rejected Marcuse's thesis that the proletariat, as Marx understood it, had become a mythological concept in advanced capitalist society. Although he agreed with Marcuse's critical analysis of the ruling ideology, Mattick demonstrated that the theory of one dimensionality itself existed only as ideology. Marcuse subsequently affirmed that Mattick's was the best critique to which his book was subjected.  Later life  Up through the seventies, many old and new articles by Mattick were published in different languages for various publications. In the academic year 1974-75, Mattick was engaged as visiting professor at the \\"Red\\" University-Center of Roskilde in Denmark. Here, he held lectures on Marx' critique of political economy, on the history of the workers movement and served as critical co-referent at seminars with other guests such as Maximilien Rubel, Ernest Mandel, Joan Robinson and others. In 1977, he completed his last important lecture tour of the University of Mexico City. He spoke in West Germany only twice: in 1971 at Berlin and in 1975 at Hanover. In his last years, Mattick thus succeeded in getting a small audience within the new generations for his views. In 1978, a major collection of articles from over forty years appeared as Anti-Bolshevik Communism. Mattick died in February 1981 leaving an almost finished manuscript for another book, which was later edited and published by his son, Paul Mattick, Jr., as Marxism - Last Refuge of the Bourgeoisie?.

Structure of a twill. The offset at each row forms the diagonal pattern. Structure of a twill Twill is a type of textile weave with a pattern of diagonal parallel ribs. It is one of three fundamental types of textile weaves along with plain weave and satin. It is made by passing the weft thread over one or more warp threads then under two or more warp threads and so on, with a \\"step,\\" or offset, between rows to create the characteristic diagonal pattern. Because of this structure, twill generally drapes well.  Classification  Twill weaves can be classified from four points of view: # According to the stepping: #* Warp-way: 3/1 warp way twill, etc. #* Weft-way: 2/3 weft way twill, etc. # According to the direction of twill lines on the face of the fabric: #* S-twill, or left-hand twill weave: 2/1 S, etc. #* Z-twill, or right-hand twill weave: 3/2 Z, etc. # According to the face yarn (warp or weft): #* Warp face twill weave: 4/2 S, etc. #* Weft face twill weave: 1/3 Z, etc. #* Double face twill weave: 3/3 Z, etc. # According to the nature of the produced twill line: #* Simple twill weave: 1/2 S, 3/1 Z etc. #* Expanded twill weave: 4/3 S, 3/2 Z, etc. #* Multiple twill weave: 2/3/3/1 S, etc. Structure In a twill weave, each weft or filling yarn floats across the warp yarns in a progression of interlacings to the right or left, forming a pattern of distinct diagonal lines. This diagonal pattern is also known as a wale. A float is the portion of a yarn that crosses over two or more perpendicular yarns. A twill weave requires three or more harnesses, depending on its complexity and is the second most basic weave that can be made on a fairly simple loom. Twill weave is often designated as a fraction, such as , in which the numerator indicates the number of harnesses that are raised (and thus threads crossed: in this example, two), and the denominator indicates the number of harnesses that are lowered when a filling yarn is inserted (in this example, one). The fraction is read as \\"two up, one down\\" (the fraction for plain weave is .). The minimum number of harnesses needed to produce a twill can be determined by totaling the numbers in the fraction; for the example described, the number of harnesses is three. Twill weave can be identified by its diagonal lines. Characteristics herringbone Diamond twill, with weaving edge (left), blue warp, red weft Twill fabrics technically have a front and a back side, unlike plain weave, whose two sides are the same. The front side of the twill is called the technical face and the back the technical back. The technical face side of a twill weave fabric is the side with the most pronounced wale; it is usually more durable and more attractive, is most often used as the fashion side of the fabric, and is the side visible during weaving. If there are warp floats on the technical face (i.e. if the warp crosses over two or more wefts), there will be filling floats (the weft will cross over two or more warps) on the technical back. If the twill wale goes up to the right on one side, it will go up to the left on the other side. Twill fabrics have no \\"up\\" and \\"down\\" as they are woven. Sheer fabrics are seldom made with a twill weave. Because a twill surface already has interesting texture and design, printed twills (where a design is printed on the cloth) are much less common than printed plain weaves. When twills are printed, this is typically done on lightweight fabrics. Soiling and stains are less noticeable on the uneven surface of twills than on a smooth surface, such as plain weaves, and as a result twills are often used for sturdy work clothing and for durable upholstery. Denim, for example, is a twill. The fewer interlacings in twills as compared to other weaves allow the yarns to move more freely, and therefore they are softer and more pliable, and drape better than plain-weave textiles. Twills also recover from creasing better than plain-weave fabrics do. When there are fewer interlacings, the yarns can be packed closer together to produce high-count fabrics. With higher counts, including high-count twills, the fabric is more durable, and is air- and water-resistant. Twills can be divided into even-sided and warp-faced. Even-sided twills include foulard or surah, herringbone, houndstooth, serge, sharkskin, and twill flannel. Warp- faced twills include cavalry twill, chino, covert, denim, drill, fancy twill, gabardine, and lining twill.

It can also be conceptualised as abnormal or supernormal profit. In practice, identifying and measuring (or collecting) resource rent is not straightforward. At any point in time, rent depends on the availability of information, market conditions, technology and the system of property rights used to govern access to and management of resources. Categories of rent Rent can be categorised into different kinds depending on how it is created. In general one can distinguish three different kinds of rent, which can also occur together: differential, scarcity, and entrepreneurial rent. * Differential rent (also called quality or Ricardian rent) arises because of differences in the quality of similar goods or inputs (e.g. production sites). Consider two companies that extract coal of identical quality. The market price of coal is $50/t. Company X operates at a production site where it is very easy to extract coal. Its costs (including normal returns) amount to $20/t. Company Y operates at a site where it is relatively difficult to extract coal. Its costs (including normal returns) amount to $30/t. Company X will ‚Äòcreate‚Äô more resource rent because of the more accessible resource. * Scarcity rent The marginal opportunity cost imposed on future generations by extracting one more unit of a resource today. Scarcity rent is one of two costs the extraction of a finite resource imposes on society. The other is marginal extraction cost--the opportunity cost of resources employed in the extraction activity. Scarcity rent is the cost of \\"using up\\" a finite resource because benefits of the extracted resource are unavailable to future generations. Efficiency is achieved when the resource price--the benefit society is willing to pay for the resource today--is equal to the sum of marginal extraction cost and scarcity rent. * Entrepreneurial rent (also called quasi-rent or Schumpeterian rent) can accrue due to entrepreneurial skills or managerial investments. A company may invest in advertising, training of employees, and so forth. These investments can result in a higher price (brand) or lower costs (better technology). Consider the ‚Äúproduction‚Äù of rock lobster where the costs to produce one rock lobster (i.e. paying for labour, the nets, and the like, and including normal profit) amount to $3. Assume the rock lobster is sold for $5 on the market. Resource rent here amounts to $2. However, assume the fisher has managed to decrease the costs for catching rock lobster from $3 to $2. This could be due to his/her entrepreneurial skills and more efficient use of labour and capital. Resource rent increases from $2 to $3.

According to the theoretical model of perfect competition, abnormal profits are unsustainable because they stimulate new supply, which forces down prices and eliminates the abnormal profit.

In principle, there are three kinds of abnormal profit: *Monopoly profit *Resource rent *Intramarginal rent. Business writer Michael Porter and Anita M. McGahan undertook an empirical study of the \\"emergence and sustainability of abnormal profits\\" in 2003, in which they concluded that both industry structure and firm performance were determinants of whether abnormal profits could be sustained by firms.Porter, M. and McGahan, A., The emergence and sustainability of abnormal profits, Strategic Organization, Vol. 1, No. 1 (February 2003), pp. 79-108 See also *Economic rent *War profiteering *Windfall profits *Excess profits tax References Profit Monopoly (economics) ","title":"Abnormal profit"},{"id":"703112","title":"William Borah"},{"id":"703113","text":"Henry Sweet (15 September 1845 ‚Äì 30 April 1912) was an English philologist, phonetician and grammarian.Concise Oxford Companion to the English Language, as hosted on encyclopedia.com As a philologist, he specialized in the Germanic languages, particularly Old English and Old Norse. In addition, Sweet published works on larger issues of phonetics and grammar in language and the teaching of languages. Many of his ideas have remained influential, and a number of his works continue to be in print, being used as course texts at colleges and universities. Life and work Henry Sweet was born in St. Pancras in London. He was educated at Bruce Castle School and King's College School, London.'SWEET, Henry MA, PhD, LLD', in Who Was Who 1897‚Äì1915 (London: A. & C. Black, 1988 reprint, ) In 1864, he spent a short time studying at Heidelberg University. Upon his return to England, he took up an office job with a trading company in London. Five years later, aged twenty-four, he won a scholarship in German and entered Balliol College in Oxford. Sweet neglected his formal academic coursework, concentrating instead on pursuing excellence in his private studies. Early recognition came in his first year at Oxford, when the prestigious Philological Society (whose President he was destined to become later on) published a paper of his on Old English. In 1871, still an undergraduate, he edited King Alfred's translation of the Cura Pastoralis for the Early English Text Society (King Alfred's West-Saxon Version of Gregory's Pastoral Care: With an English Translation, the Latin Text, Notes, and an Introduction), his commentary establishing the foundation for Old English dialectology. He graduated, nearly thirty years old, with a fourth-class degree in literae humaniores. Subsequent works on Old English included An Anglo-Saxon Reader (1876), The Oldest English Texts (1885) and A Student's Dictionary of Anglo-Saxon (1896). Sweet, like his contemporary Walter Skeat, felt under particular pressure from German scholars in English studies who, often state-employed, tenured, and accompanied by their comitatus of eager graduate students, \\"annexed\\" the historical study of English. Dismayed by the \\"swarms of young program-mongers turned out every year by German universities,\\" he felt that \\"no English dilettante can hope to compete with them‚Äîexcept by Germanizing himself and losing all his nationality.\\"The Oldest English Texts, ed. Henry Sweet (London: EETS, 1885), p. v. See further Richard Utz, Chaucer and the Discourse of German Philology (Turnhout: Brepols, 2002), pp. 67-69. In 1877, Sweet published A Handbook of Phonetics, which attracted international attention among scholars and teachers of English in Europe. He followed up with the Elementarbuch des gesprochenen Englisch (1885), which was subsequently adapted as A Primer of Spoken English (1890). This included the first scientific description of educated London speech, later known as received pronunciation, with specimens of connected speech represented in phonetic script. In addition, he developed a version of shorthand called Current Shorthand, which had both orthographic and phonetic modes.Sweet, Henry: A Manual of Current Shorthand, Orthographic and Phonetic (Oxford: Clarendon, 1892). Online version from Rider University His emphasis on spoken language and phonetics made him a pioneer in language teaching, a subject which he covered in detail in The Practical Study of Languages (1899). In 1901, Sweet was made reader in phonetics at Oxford.The Columbia Encyclopedia, as hosted on encyclopedia.com The Sounds of English (1908) was his last book on English pronunciation. Other books by Sweet include An Icelandic Primer with Grammar, Notes and Glossary (1886), The History of Language (1900; 1995: ; 2007: ), and a number of other works he edited for the Early English Text Society. Sweet was also closely involved in the early history of the Oxford English Dictionary. Despite the recognition he received for his scholarly work, Sweet never received a university professorship, a fact that disturbed him greatly, although he was appointed reader. He had done poorly as a student at Oxford, he had annoyed many people through bluntness, and he failed to make every effort to gather official support.Howatt, Anthony Philip Reid; Widdowson, Henry George: A History of English Language Teaching. Oxford University Press (2004), pp. 198‚Äì207. (Online text) His relationship with the Oxford University Press was often strained. Sweet died on 30 April 1912 in Oxford, of pernicious anemia; he left no children.Kunitz, Stanley; Haycraft, Howard: British Authors of the Nineteenth Century. The H. Wilson Company (1936), p. 598. Other interests In Who's Who, 1911, Sweet gave his recreations as: Legacy Sweet has retained a reputation as \\"the man who taught Europe phonetics\\". His work established an applied linguistics tradition in language teaching which has continued without interruption to the present day. A bibliography and Collected Papers were published by H. C. Wyld. In the preface to his play Pygmalion, George Bernard Shaw, after describing Sweet, stated that \\"[Henry] Higgins is not a portrait of Sweet, to whom the adventure of Eliza Doolittle would have been impossible; still, as will be seen, there are touches of Sweet in the play.\\" The Henry Sweet Society for the History of Linguistic Ideas (founded 1984) is named after him.

Along with Andr√© Derain and Henri Matisse he is considered one of the principal figures in the Fauve movement, a group of modern artists who from 1904 to 1908 were united in their use of intense colour.Freeman, Judi, et al. The Fauve Landscape, pp.13‚Äì14. Abbeville Press, 1990. Vlaminck was one of the Fauves at the controversial Salon d'Automne exhibition of 1905. Life Photograph of Andr√© Derain (left) and Vlaminck (right), 1942 Maurice de Vlaminck was born on Rue Pierre Lescot in Paris. His father Edmond Julien was Flemish and taught violin and his mother Jos√©phine Caroline Grillet came from Lorraine and taught piano. His father taught him to play the violin.Melikian, Souren. \\"Vlaminck: Expressing mood with color\\", International Herald Tribune, 11 July 2008. Retrieved 13 July 2008. He began painting in his late teens. In 1893, he studied with a painter named Henri Rigalon on the √éle de Chatou.Freeman, page 319. In 1894 he married Suzanne Berly. The turning point in his life was a chance meeting on the train to Paris towards the end of his stint in the army. Vlaminck, then 23, met an aspiring artist, Andr√© Derain, with whom he struck up a lifelong friendship. When Vlaminck completed his army service in 1900, the two rented a studio together, the Maison Levanneur, which now houses the Cneai,Cneai for a year before Derain left to do his own military service. In 1902 and 1903 he wrote several mildly pornographic novels illustrated by Derain.Freeman, p.319. He painted during the day and earned his livelihood by giving violin lessons and performing with musical bands at night.

After viewing the boldly colored canvases of Vlaminck, Henri Matisse, Andr√© Derain, Albert Marquet, Kees van Dongen, Charles Camoin, and Jean Puy, the art critic Louis Vauxcelles disparaged the painters as \\"fauves\\" (wild beasts), thus giving their movement the name by which it became known, Fauvism.Louis Vauxcelles, Le Salon d'Automne, Gil Blas, 17 October 1905. Screen 5 and 6. Gallica, Biblioth√®que nationale de France, In 1911, Vlaminck traveled to London and painted by the Thames. In 1913, he painted again with Derain in Marseille and Martigues. In World War I he was stationed in Paris, and began writing poetry. Eventually he settled in Rueil-la-Gadeli√®re, a small village south-west of Paris. He married his second wife, Berthe Combes, with whom he had two daughters. From 1925 he traveled throughout France, but continued to paint primarily along the Seine, near Paris. Resentful that Fauvism had been overtaken by Cubism as an art movement Vlaminck blamed Picasso \\"for dragging French painting into a wretched dead end and state of confusion\\". During the Second World War Vlaminck visited Germany and on his return published a tirade against Picasso and Cubism in the periodical Comoedia in June 1942. A gifted story teller, Vlaminck wrote many autobiographies, which were somewhat marred either by vagueness or lack of absolute truthfulness.Freeman, pages 123, 319 Vlaminck died in Rueil-la-Gadeli√®re on 11 October 1958. Artistic career Town on the Bank of a Lake, c.1909, oil on canvas, 81.3 x 100.3 cm, Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg Le pont de Poissy, c.1910, oil on canvas, 46.4 x 54.9 cm Village, c.1912, oil on canvas, 73.7 x 92.1 cm (29 x 36 1/4 in.), Art Institute of Chicago Two of Vlaminck's groundbreaking paintings, Sur le zinc (At the Bar) and L'homme a la pipe (Man Smoking a Pipe) were painted in 1900. For the next few years Vlaminck lived in or near Chatou (the inspiration for his painting houses at Chatou), painting and exhibiting alongside Derain, Matisse, and other Fauvist painters. At this time his exuberant paint application and vibrant use of colour displayed the influence of Vincent van Gogh. Sur le zinc called to mind the work of Toulouse-Lautrec and his portrayals of prostitutes and solitary drinkers, but does not attempt to probe the sitter's psychology‚Äîa break with the century-old European tradition of individualized portraiture. According to art critic Souren Melikian, it is \\"the impersonal cartoon of a type.\\" In his landscape paintings, his approach was similar. He ignored the details, with the landscape becoming a vehicle through which he could express mood through violent colour and brushwork. An example is Sous bois, painted in 1904. The following year, he began to experiment with \\"deconstruction,\\" turning the physical world into dabs and streaks of colour that convey a sense of motion. His paintings Le Pont de Chatou (The Chatou Bridge), Les Ramasseurs de pommes de terre (The Potato Pickers), La Seine a Chatou (The River Seine at Chatou) and Le Verger (The Orchard) exemplify this trend. Artistic influences Vlaminck's compositions show familiarity with the Impressionists, several of whom had painted in the same area in the 1870s and 1880s. After visiting a Van Gogh exhibit, he declared that he \\"loved Van Gogh that day more than my own father\\".Freeman, pp.15-21 From 1908 his palette grew more monochromatic, and the predominant influence was that of C√©zanne. His later work displayed a dark palette, punctuated by heavy strokes of contrasting white paint. Some of his works are held at the Minneapolis Institute of Art.

Fictional character biography Death on the cover of graphic novel The Death of Captain Marvel (1982). Art by Jim Starlin. Death is an abstract entity, the embodiment of the end of life in the Marvel Universe, and the opposite of Eternity, the embodiment of the universe.Quasar #19 - 25 (Feb. - Aug. 1991) Death is predominantly depicted as a skeleton cloaked in a black or purple robe, and at times appears as a Caucasian human female. A storyline in the title Captain Marvel showcases Thanos' scheme to conquer the universe, as the character becomes determined to prove his love for Death by destroying all life. Although Thanos obtains the artifact the Cosmic Cube and succeeds in taking control of the universe, Death abandons the character when he is defeated by the combined might of Captain Marvel, Drax the Destroyer and the Avengers.Captain Marvel #26 - 33 (Jun. - Jan. 1973 - 1974) Two Marvel Annuals feature Thanos as he tries to \\"woo\\" Death back (courtesy of the Infinity Gems with which he plans to extinguish every star in the galaxy), but the character is killed in a final battle with the Avengers, Captain Marvel and Adam Warlock.Avengers Annual #7 + Marvel Two-In- One Annual #2 (1977) When Captain Marvel is dying from cancer, Thanos returns to the character in a vision and introduces him to the entity Death. Marvel willingly surrenders his life and embraces the entity.The Death of Captain Marvel (Apr. 1982) In Marvel's first limited series Contest of Champions, Death agrees to a game of strategy with the Elder of the Universe the Grandmaster. The Grandmaster wins the game and Death provides him with the power (via the Golden Globe of Life) to resurrect the Collector,Killed by the entity Korvac in Avengers #175 (Sep. 1978) a fellow Elder. Only then does Death reveal that the Golden Globe is an empty instrument that needs to be powered by a life-force equal to that of the being who is to be restored. To resurrect the Collector, the Grandmaster sacrifices his life and takes the Collector's place in the Realm of the Dead.Contest of Champions # 1 - 3 (Jun - Aug. 1982) In the limited series Secret Wars II the entity the Beyonder takes human form and visits Earth. It decides to \\"save\\" mankind, and in doing so destroys Death, but is then shown there is a need for Death and recreates the entity.Secret Wars II #6 (Dec. 1985) In an Avengers Annual the Grandmaster reveals his sacrifice was a ruse as he is able to steal Death's powers and via another deception tricks the entity into banishing all Elders from the Realm of the Dead, effectively rendering them immortal.Avengers Annual #16 (1987) The threads of this storyline continue in the title Silver Surfer where a group of eleven Elders conspires to use the Infinity Gems to kill the cosmic entity Galactus and thereby destroy reality itself. After their plan is thwarted, Galactus devours five of the Elders, assuming that his status as a being who transcends Death and Eternity means that he does not have to abide by Death's vow. However, Galactus finds the Elders difficult to absorb and Death is displeased that Galactus has chosen to ignore her vow.Silver Surfer vol.3, #10 (April 1988) Subsequently, when three Elders ‚Äì the Astronomer; Possessor and Trader ‚Äì threaten to use the Infinity Gems to prevent the In- Betweener from hurling Galactus (with their brother Elders still inside him) into a black hole, the conceptual being responds by summoning Death and forcing her to negate the three Elders against her will, a transgression that Death finds heinous.Silver Surfer vol. 3, #17 (Nov. 1988) The limited series The Thanos Quest reveals that Death perceives an imbalance in the universe and a gradual shift towards life rather than death, the entity resurrects Thanos. Thanos successfully collects the Infinity Gems, and attempts to converse with Death on its own level. The irony is the character is now superior to Death, and as such Death may not speak with him (a fact relayed via one of Death's minions).Thanos Quest #1 - 2 (Sep. - Oct. 1990) The story continues in a consecutive limited series The Infinity Gauntlet, in which Thanos then wipes half the beings in the universe from existence as proof of his love for Death; the entity remains and watches as he battles Earth's metahumans, but after they are defeated, Death joins the cosmic pantheon in trying to defeat Thanos. Though the cosmic entities are unsuccessful, Thanos eventually loses the Infinity Gems and is defeated.Infinity Gauntlet #1 - 6 (July - Dec. 1991) The mercenary Deadpool is depicted having a humorous exchange with the entity in a self-titled Annual. Deadpool becomes infatuated with Death after he has a number of near-death experiences.Deadpool/Death '98 (1998) During the Funeral for a Freak storyline, Death appears to reciprocate the feeling, and a jealous Thanos prevents Deadpool from dying and joining the entity by cursing him with immortality.Deadpool vol. 2, #61 - 64 (Feb. - May 2002) In the second volume of Captain Marvel, Death reunites with Thanos to confront the Death God Walker, who tries unsuccessfully to court Death. Death hides within the body of Marlo Chandler (the girlfriend of Rick Jones) in an attempt to escape Walker. The entity eventually destroys Walker and then leaves the body of Marlo, although Marlo retains a connection to Death which (in extreme circumstances) allows her to access the cosmic powers of Death.Captain Marvel vol. 2, #17 - 19 (Feb. - Mar. 2001) The limited series Avengers: Celestial Quest continues to explore the relationship between Death and Thanos, as the entity reveals to Thanos that their energies merged when he was resurrected, creating an offspring called the Rot. Death and Thanos work together to destroy their offspring, and it is at this time that Death finally addresses Thanos and admits to feeling \\"love\\" for him.Avengers: Celestial Quest #1 - 8 (Sep. 2001 - Apr. 2002) The pair also share a kiss in the limited series Marvel: The End, moments before Thanos, possessing the artifact the Heart of the Universe, recreates the universe minus a critical flaw that would have destroyed it.Marvel: The End #1 - 6 (May - Aug. 2003) During the limited series Annihilation, Thanos joins the fight to stop the Annihilation Wave, and during the war is killed by his old foe Drax the Destroyer. When the hero Nova is near death from injuries sustained in battle, he glimpses Death and Thanos standing together watching him.Annihilation #6 (Mar. 2007): Annihilation #1 - 6 (Oct. 2006 - Mar. 2007) The second volume of the Guardians of the Galaxy features a new development: Phyla-Vell, the heroine Quasar, agrees to become the new avatar of Oblivion (an aspect of Death) in exchange for the freedom of lover Heather Douglas.Guardians of the Galaxy #12 (May 2009) In The Thanos Imperative, the Captain Marvel of the Cancerverse, called Lord Mar-Vell, using a ritual to the Many-angled ones that involves sacrificing the Avatar of Death, is able to destroy Death's M-body and remove her from his universe.Thanos Imperative vol. 1, #3 (October 2010) In the last issue of this six-part mini-series, it is revealed that Thanos, upon coming back to life, has been completely removed from the realm of death and can no longer die. In a twist he appears to accept Lord Mar-Vell's proposal to be a sacrifice so the Many-angled ones can invade the 616 universe; however, this proves a trap set by Death herself in order to get close to Mar-Vell. By destroying him, she kills every living thing in the Cancerverse, initiates its and the Fault's collapse, and even injures the Many-angled ones to such a degree that it will take them eons to heal.Thanos Imperative vol. 1, #6 (January 2011) During the Chaos War storyline, Daimon Hellstrom mentions to Hercules that Death has fled their reality upon Amatsu-Mikaboshi triumphing in the realms of the dead, causing the souls of the deceased to be unleashed upon the Earth, and rendering the victims of the siege, whose injuries might otherwise prove fatal, merely locked in a deathless limbo.Chaos War #2 Following the Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy storyline, Death has appeared in Las Vegas under the guise of Marlo Chandler to talk with Ben Reilly - the clone of Spider-Man, recently brought back to life and spending some time acting as the new Jackal - initially instructing him to go after a duo of teen punks randomly shooting civilians around the city, claiming that she is testing what he will do about this discovery. Ben manages to find the criminals, shooting one of them twice with his own gun but avoiding causing fatal injuries, but when he is attacked by his \\"brother\\" and fellow clone Kaine after the death of a girl Reilly had been trying to treat for a serious illness, Marlo appears and kills Kaine with a single touch.Ben Reilly: The Scarlet Spider #6 \\"Marlo\\" subsequently identifies herself as Death and explains that she has an \\"interest\\" in Reilly as no other person has been brought back to life so often. She reveals that he has \\"died\\" so many times that his soul has become corrupted and if he undergoes one more resurrection, he will likely suffer so much spiritual damage that his soul will be broken for good. She offers Reilly the chance to restore Cassandra Mercury's daughter Abigail or Kaine to life before she departs. When Reilly asks her to save both of them and kill him instead, Death not only heals the other two, but also restores Reilly to a healthy physical appearance. Death also affirms that he has made a start on his efforts to redeem himself of his sins as the Jackal and to become a hero again.Ben Reilly: The Scarlet Spider #7 However, after Ben Reilly brutally beats a civilian who was responsible for the theft of food donations to a charity drive,Ben Reilly: The Scarlet Spider #10 Death reveals that the healing of his scars only remains so long as Reilly does not compromise his status as a hero, with the aforementioned beating leading to him regaining scars around his right eye.Ben Reilly: The Scarlet Spider #11 Powers and abilities Death is an abstract entity, possessing nigh infinite power and knowledge. The character occasionally appears as a humanoid female so as to be able to be perceived by lesser beings, and resides inside a pocket dimension known as the Realm of Death.Thanos Quest #1 (1990) Other versions Earth X In the series Earth X, Death used the secret that Thanos' mother was a Skrull to trick him into believing she is his mother. When the deception is revealed, Thanos uses the Ultimate Nullifier to destroy Death.Earth X #0-12 (March 1999 - April 2000) In other media Television The character was featured in the Silver Surfer animated series, voiced by Lally Cadeau. Due to Fox's broadcast standards, this version was depicted as a female personification of chaos known as Lady Chaos. Thanos would talk to a statue of Lady Chaos.

Jabal al-Druze (, jabal ad-dur≈´z, Mountain of the Druze), officially Jabal al-Arab (, jabal al-  øarab, Mountain of the Arabs), is an elevated volcanic region in the As- Suwayda Governorate of southern Syria. Most of the inhabitants of this region are Druze, and there are also small Muslim and Christian communities. Safaitic inscriptions were first found in this area. The State of Jabal Druze was an autonomous area in the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon from 1921 to 1936. In the past, the name Jabal al-Druze was used for a different area, located in Mount Lebanon. Geology Map of Jabal al-Druze The Jabal al-Druze volcanic field, the southernmost in Syria, lies in the Haurun-Druze Plateau in SW Syria near the border with Jordan. The most prominent feature of this volcanic field is 1800m-high Jabal al-Druze (also known variously as Jabal ad Duruz, Djebel Al-Arab, Jabal Druze, Djebel ed Drouz). The alkaline volcanic field consists of a group of 118 basaltic volcanoes active from the lower- Pleistocene to the Holocene (2.6 million years ago to present). The large SW Plateau depression is filled by basaltic lava flows from volcanoes aligned in a NW-SE direction.

Date: November 12, 1921 to February 6, 1922 The Washington Naval Conference, was a disarmament conference called by the United States and held in Washington, DC from November 12, 1921 to February 6, 1922. It was conducted outside the auspices of the League of Nations. It was attended by nine nations (the United States, Japan, China, France, Britain, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, and Portugal) regarding interests in the Pacific Ocean and East Asia. Soviet Russia was not invited to the conference. It was the first arms control conference in history, and Kaufman shows that it is studied by political scientists as a model for a successful disarmament movement. Held at Memorial Continental Hall, in Downtown Washington,On the Trail of Military Intelligence History: A Guide to the Washington, DC, Area it resulted in three major treaties: Four-Power Treaty, Five-Power Treaty (more commonly known as the Washington Naval Treaty), the Nine-Power Treaty, and a number of smaller agreements. These treaties preserved the peace during the 1920s but were not renewed in the increasingly-hostile world of the Great Depression. Background The world's popular mood was peace and disarmament throughout the 1920s. Women had just won the right to vote in many countries, and they helped convince politicians that money could be saved, votes won, and future wars avoided by stopping the arms race.Michael J. Turner, Britain and the World in the Twentieth Century (2010) p. 10 Across the world, leaders of the women's suffrage movement formed international organizations such as the International Council of Women and the International Woman Suffrage Alliance. The historian Martin Pugh wrote they achieved the greatest influence in the 1920s, \\"when they helped to promote women's contribution to the anti-war movement throughout the Western world.\\" In the United States, practically all the major Protestant denominations and highly-visible Protestant spokesmen were strong supporters of international peace efforts. They collaborated to work to educate their local congregations on the need for peace and disarmament. Robert Moats Miller, \\"The Attitudes of the Major Protestant Churches in America Toward War and Peace, 1919-1929,\\" The Historian 19#1 (1956), pp. 13-38 online. At the end of World War I, the British still had the largest navy afloat, but its big ships were becoming obsolete, and the Americans and the Japanese were rapidly building expensive new warships. Britain and Japan were allies in a treaty that was due to expire in 1922. Although there were no immediate dangers, observers increasingly pointed to the American-Japanese rivalry for control of the Pacific Ocean as a long-term threat to world peace. By then, the British decided that it was better for them to cast their lot with Washington than Tokyo. To stop a needless, expensive, and possibly-dangerous arms race, the major countries signed a series of naval disarmament agreements.Richard W. Fanning, Peace and disarmament: naval rivalry & arms control, 1922-1933 (1995) pp. 1-24 Meeting The American delegation, led by Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes, included Elihu Root, Henry Cabot Lodge and Oscar Underwood, the last being the Democratic minority leader in the Senate. The conference's primary objective was to restrain Japanese naval expansion in the waters of the West Pacific, especially with regard to fortifications on strategically-valuable islands. Its secondary objectives were intended to obtain an ultimate limit Japanese to expansion and also an alleviation of concerns over possible antagonism with the British. They were to eliminate Anglo-American tension by abrogating the Anglo-Japanese alliance, to agree upon a favorable naval ratio vis-√†-vis Japan, and to have the Japanese officially accept a continuation of the Open Door Policy in China. The British, however, took a more cautious and tempered approach. Indeed, the British officials brought certain general desires to the conference: to achieve peace and stability in the West Pacific; avoid a naval arms race with the United States; thwart Japanese encroachment into areas under their influence; and preserve the security of Singapore, Hong Kong, and Dominion countries, but they did not enter the conference with a specific laundry list of demands. Rather, they brought with them a vague vision of what the West Pacific should look like after an agreement. Japanese officials were more focused on specifics than the British, and they approached the conference with two primary goals: to sign a naval treaty with Britain and the United States and to obtain official recognition of Japan‚Äôs special interests in Manchuria and Mongolia. Japanese officials also brought other issues to the conference: a strong demand to remain in control of Yap, Siberia, and Tsingtao as well as more general concerns about the growing presence of American fleets in the Pacific. The American hand was strengthened by the interception and decryption of secret instructions from the Japanese government to its delegation. The message revealed the lowest naval ratio that would be acceptable to Tokyo; US negotiators used that knowledge to push the Japanese. This success, one of the first in the US government's budding eavesdropping and cryptology efforts, led eventually to the growth of such agencies. The head of the Japanese delegation to the Washington Naval Conference was Prince Iyesato Tokugawa, who during the first four decades of the twentieth century led a political movement in Japan that promoted democracy and international goodwill with the U.S., Europe and Asia. His influence was significant in the negotiations and ratification of the Washington Naval Treaty. Agreements The Washington Conference was called by US President Warren Harding and run by Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes. Harding demanded action to gain domestic political credit. Hughes, helped by the cryptographers who were reading the Japanese diplomatic secrets, brilliantly engineered a deal that all countries thought best for themselves.Roger Dingman, Power in the Pacific: the origins of naval arms limitation, 1914‚Äì1922 (1976) p. 217 To resolve technical disputes about the quality of warships, the conferees adopted a quantitative standard, based on the tonnage displacement, a simple measure of the size of a ship. A ten-year agreement fixed the ratio of battleships at 5:5:3: 525,000 tons for the US, 525,000 tons for Britain, and 315,000 tons for Japan. Smaller limits with a ratio of 1.67 applied to France and Italy.Germany was still limited to zero by the Versailles Treaty, and Soviet Russia, a pariah nation because of its communism, was not invited. Battleships, the dominant weapons systems of the era, could be no larger than 35,000 tons. The major powers allowed themselves 135,000:135,000:81,000 tons for the newly-developed aircraft carriers. The Washington Conference exactly captured the worldwide popular demand for peace and disarmament. Without it, the US, Britain and Japan would have engaged in an expensive buildup, with each fearing the other two getting too powerful. However, even with the restrictions, the agreement solidified Japan's position as a great power; it got parity in the Pacific with the two leading global navies, was allowed to maintain a larger naval force than France and Italy and was treated as a colonial power with equal diplomatic interests, a first for a non-Western nation.Schenkein, Joshua. \\"Japan, The Great Power: Industrialization Through The Lens Of Zaibatsu.\\", pp. 1‚Äì5. The agreements forced the US to scrap 15 old battleships and 2 new ones, along with 13 ships under construction. The naval treaty was concluded on February 6, 1922. Ratifications of the treaty were exchanged in Washington on August 17, 1923, and it was registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on April 16, 1924.League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. 25, pp. 202‚Äì227. Japan agreed to revert Shandong to Chinese control by an agreement concluded on February 4, 1922. Ratifications of the agreement were exchanged in Beijing on June 2, 1922, and it was registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on July 7, 1922.League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. 10, pp. 310-331.text of the agreement Results The Washington Naval Treaty led to an effective end to building new battleship fleets, and the few ships that were built were limited in size and armament. Many existing capital ships were scrapped. Some ships under construction were turned into aircraft carriers instead. Even with the treaty, the major navies remained suspicious of one another and briefly (1927‚Äì1930) engaged in a race to build heavy cruisers, which had been limited in size (10,000 tons) but not numbers.George W. Baer, One Hundred Years of Sea Power: The U. S. Navy, 1890-1990 (1994) pp. 108-9. That oversight was resolved on value of cruisers by the London Naval Treaty of 1930, which specified a 10:10:7 ratio for cruisers and destroyers. For the first time, submarines were also limited, with Japan given parity with the US and Britain, at 53,000 tons each. (Submarines typically displaced 1,000-2,000 tons each.) The US Navy maintained an active building program that replaced obsolescent warships with technically more sophisticated new models in part because its construction yards were important sources of political patronage and so were well protected by Congress. During the New Deal, relief funds were used to build more warships. \\"The naval program was wholly mine,\\" President Franklin Roosevelt boasted.Quoted in Harlow A. Hyde, Scraps of paper: the disarmament treaties between the world wars (1988) p. 239 Termination The pacts and the treaties that resulted from the Washington Naval Treaty remained in effect for fourteen years.

Popular in his native Hong Kong, To has also found acclaim overseas. Intensely prolific, To has made films in a variety of genres, though in the West he is best known for his action and crime movies, which have earned him critical respect and a cult following (which include Quentin Tarantino, who once said that he really loves to watch To's gangster films). To's biggest international successes include Breaking News, Election, Election 2 (a.k.a. Triad Election), Exiled, Mad Detective and Drug War; these films have appeared in a number of international film festivals, been distributed theatrically in France and the United States, and been widely sold to foreign countries. His films, often made in collaboration with the same group of actors, screenwriters and cinematographers, frequently explore themes of friendship, fate and the changing face of Hong Kong society. Sometimes described as \\"multifaceted and chameleonic\\" due to his ability to switch tones and genres between movies, To is nonetheless seen as having a consistent style, which involves mixing subdued realism and social observation with highly stylised visual and acting elements. To has cited King Hu as the director who has influenced his work the most. To heads the Hong Kong-based production company Milkyway Image with his frequent co-director Wai Ka-Fai. Career Johnnie To began his career at age 17 as a messenger for the Hong Kong television studio TVB. From there To moved up the ladder, working as an executive producer and director for TV shows starting in 1973. In 1978, he shot his first theatrical feature, but continued working in television. In 1983, he directed and screen- wrote the critically acclaimed The Legend of the Condor Heroes, a dramatised TV series base on the martial art novel of the same name by Louis Cha. While working as an assistant TV director during the Shaw Studios era, he directed All About Ah-Long in 1989, starring Chow Yun-fat, the film became one of the biggest box office hits in that year. In 1988, he co-directed The Big Heat, his first action movie. The film was produced by Tsui Hark. The end of the 1980s also saw some of To's biggest commercial successes, the vast majority of which were comedies. His 1988 film The Eighth Happiness was that year's highest-grossing movie. In 1996, To and frequent collaborator Wai Ka-Fai formed Milkyway Image, a production house that specialises in cost-efficient independent films made by To and Wai, as well their frequent collaborators from Law Wing-Cheong to scriptwriter Yau Nai-Hoi. In April 2011, it was announced that he would be a member of the jury for the main competition at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. His 2011 film Life Without Principle was selected as the Hong Kong entry for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar at the 85th Academy Awards, but it did not make the final shortlist. To is a member of the governing Council of the Hong Kong Arts Development Council. Festivals and awards Commercially successful in his native Hong Kong, To's films have regularly appeared at international festivals, most notably in Europe and North America. Six of To's films have been featured at the Cannes Film Festival: Breaking News premiered as an Out-of-Competition midnight screening in 2004; Election was shown in Competition in 2005; its sequel, Election 2 (a.k.a. Triad Election) was screened in Out-of-Competition midnight screenings in 2006, and Triangle was screened in Out-of-Competition midnight screenings in 2007; Vengeance competed for the prestigious Palme D'Or in 2009; Blind Detective was screened in Out-of-Competition midnight screenings in 2013. At the Berlin International Film Festival, Sparrow was shown in Competition in 2008. At the Venice International Film Festival, Throw Down was screened Out-of-Competition in 2004; Exiled was shown in Competition at the festival in 2006; Mad Detective was shown in Competition in 2007; Life Without Principle was shown in Competition in 2011. In North America, To's films have been consistently screened at the Toronto International Film Festival. The Mission, Fulltime Killer, PTU, Breaking News, Throw Down and Mad Detective all screened between 1999 and 2007. In 2006, Election, Election 2, and Exiled were screened. In 2005, To received the \\"Time Machine Career Achievement Award\\" at the Festival de Cine de Sitges, Europe's most prestigious film festival specializing in genre films. To was also honoured as a \\"Filmmaker in Focus\\" of 2007 International Film Festival Rotterdam.

A variety of names are used to refer to different designs intended for various purposes. Push-pin or map pin Thumb tacks made of brass, tin or iron may be referred to as brass tacks, brass pins, tin tacks or iron tacks, respectively. These terms are particularly used in the idiomatic expression to come (or get) down to brass (or otherwise) tacks, meaning to consider basic facts of a situation.  History  The drawing pin was invented in name and as a mass- produced item in what is now the United States in the mid/late 1750s. It was first mentioned in the Oxford English Dictionary in 1759. It was said that the use of the newly invented drawing pin to attach notices to school house doors was making significant contribution to the whittling away of their gothic doors.

Design  Design with pin formed from a cutout from the head A drawing pin has two basic components: the head, often made of plastic, metal or wood, and the body, usually made of steel or brass. The head is wide to distribute the force of pushing the pin in, allowing only the hands to be used. Many head designs exist: flat, domed, spherical, cylindrical and a variety of novelty heads such as hearts or stars. Drawing pin heads also come in a variety of colours. These can be particularly useful to mark different locations on a map. Some drawing pin designs have a portion cut out of the head and bent downward to produce a pin. FEMA Logistics specialists use a map of Tennessee and coloured pins to create a visual reference of the location and status of Disaster Recovery Centers Domed or gripped heads are sometimes preferred over flat heads as dropped flat-headed pins may easily point upward, posing a hazard.

Typically, au pairs take on a share of the family's responsibility for childcare as well as some housework, and receive a monetary allowance for personal use. Au pair arrangements are often subject to government restrictions which specify an age range usually from mid-late teens to mid to late twenties, and may explicitly limit the arrangement to females. Arrangements differ between Europe, where the concept originated, and North America. In Europe, au pairs are only supposed to work part-time, and they often also study part-time, generally focusing on the language of the host country. In the United States, they may provide full-time childcare. In 1969, the European Agreement on Au Pair Placement was signed, and it came into force in 1971. Au pair companies in the United States have significant non-refundable fees once the au pair arrives in the country. The contract does not guarantee childcare, despite many families' reliance on the program. Unlike many other types of domestic assistants, the au pair is considered a part of the host family and not merely an employee. In some countries the au pair wears a uniform, but more commonly the au pair only follows the host family's dress code and wears attire appropriate for the work description, typically including a protective apron. History The title comes from the French term au pair, meaning \\"at par\\" or \\"equal to\\", indicating that the relationship is intended to be one of equals: the au pair is intended to become a member of the family, albeit a temporary one, rather than a traditional domestic worker. Although it is not as simple to acquire au pair status as it was in 1840, the expression was used to indicate economic parity between the \\"employer\\" and their \\"employee\\". The expression au pair was used in this sense in 1840 by Honor√© de Balzac: (Sylvie Rogron was sent out to an apprenticeship at an annual cost of one hundred √©cus... After two years, she was au pair: if she didn't earn anything, her parents no longer paid anything for her room and board.) Concept and conditions The concept of the au pair originated in Europe after World War II. Before the war, an abundant supply of domestic servants had been available to look after the children of middle and upper-class families, but changes in social attitudes, and increases in wages and taxes after the war, made the old system inaccessible to most middle-class parents. At the same time, social change increased the number of middle-class girls who needed to earn their own living, and rising educational aspirations for girls made experiencing foreign cultures and learning foreign languages more common aspirations. However, due to the stigma attached to being a \\"servant\\", an essentially working-class status that even working-class people were repudiating, this potential supply for domestic labour could only be utilised if a new non-servant role was created. Thus the au pair was born. The au pair was supposed to be treated as a member of the family rather than a servant, and was not required to wear a uniform. An au pair receives an allowance and his/her own room. The usual practice is that au pairs eat with the family most of the time, and join in some of the usual family activities such as outings and trips. However, host families ordinarily expect to have some private time to themselves, particularly in the evenings. During this time, an au pair might retire to his or her room to watch television, study, or go out with friends. Provision is often made for the au pair to have time for studying, especially the language of the host country. The Council of Europe recommends that au pairs be issued standard contracts with their family. Some au pairs are now male, but females remain the overwhelming majority. Many governments impose limits as to how many hours an au pair is allowed to work. Tasks can include taking children to and from school, taking children to after-school activities, cooking, cleaning, ironing, tidying up and babysitting. Each placement varies depending on the host family. In many developing countries, an abundant supply of local domestic labour is still available, so there is little or no demand for au pairs. Au pair relationships between host families and au pairs can be established through various means. Traditionally, au pair agencies located in a given host country have served as an intermediary between young people seeking to become au pairs and families in the country that are interested in hosting an au pair. Such agencies typically charge a fee to the host family for fulfilling an intermediary role between the host family and possible au pairs. The agency conducts some process of screening and evaluation of prospective au pairs and then proposes possible au pairs to the host families, who are their principal customers. Traditional agencies also assist with the arrangement of some of the bureaucratic formalities associated with an au pair visit. In recent years, the basic function of bringing aspiring au pairs and interested host families together has increasingly been provided by websites that allow families and au pairs to post online profiles and search for each other directly on the basis of the information provided in these profiles. Such websites supplement this search functionality with various information offerings about au pair requirements in different countries as well as by providing user support for their registered users. Charges are made to users of such websites to allow a full exchange of the personal contact details necessary for finalizing an au pair placement. This approach typically gives prospective au pairs and host families a wider range of choices and more direct control over the selection process than is possible through a traditional agency at a considerably lower price than traditional agencies charge. At the same time, use of such websites requires an aspiring host family or au pair to invest more personal effort in the search process and to make their selection and arrange the formalities of an au pair stay without the involvement of a third party. Duties Au pairs can be expected to do a combination of child care and light housework duties. They are not responsible for housework that does not relate to the children's or communal living areas that are kept tidy by all family members. An au pair's primary duties are taking care of the children and entertaining them, as well as teaching the native tongue if this is required. An au pair's duties may include: * waking up the children * taking/picking up children to/from school * helping with school homework * playing with the children * taking the children on outings to parks, playgroups and other activities * preparing light meals for children and clean up after the meals * doing the children's laundry and ironing their clothes * making the children's beds * tidying up the children's toys * cleaning the children's bathroom * cleaning the children's room An au pair does not have to: * manage the whole household * prepare meals for the parents * make the host parents' beds and clean their bathrooms * clean the floors * clean the windows * take care of the pets * do gardening * supervise/take care of other children that aren't the host kids The duties of the au pair also includes following the house rules set by the host family. This includes abiding the curfew, bedtime and dress code, as well as following rules for computer and phone use. These rules may be described in a household handbook, which is provided to the au pair when moving in to the host family. The curfew and bedtime is typically assigned based on when the au pair will begin work in the following morning. Asia-Pacific Australia Australia has no official Au pair program through the government. Visas that can be used by Au pairs are the Working Holiday and Work and Holiday Visa, which both provide working rights. Students, especially those who study English, often become demi-pairs to immerse themselves into the language and culture of Australia. Au pair arrangements in Australia and work hours vary from 10 to 40 hours per week. The Cultural Au Pair Association of Australia (CAPAA) was formed in 2012 on a not-for-profit basis. CAPAA is an industry based association for Au pair agencies, with the purpose of protecting and developing the Au pair experience as a rewarding cultural exchange programme. Members agree to abide by the code of conduct developed by the International Au Pair Association (IAPA). CAPAA members agree to meet strict business and ethical standards to ensure competence, fair dealing and high integrity. The Australian Au-Pair Families Association (AAPFA) is a not- for-profit organisation and members are Australian host families. AAPFA supports self-regulation in the Au pair industry and provides information and guidance to Au-Pair families based on international hosting standards and ethics. China Au pair agencies in China sent young Chinese to Western nations to work as au pairs abroad, particularly for families who had adopted babies from China, to help them learn Chinese. In addition, China's rising middle class and economic growth have led to a growing demand for au pairs. This helps create opportunities to learn English at an early age, as well as the opportunity for mothers to return to work and have additional help in raising the children. However, the main goal for most families hiring au pairs is primarily to help their children as well as themselves learn English, as the mother has the biggest role in raising the children. To be an Au Pair in China, participants need to apply for an X or an F visa. The first one is required for internships, studies and long term courses. The F visa entitles a person to live in China to take part in a cultural exchange, study tours or language courses.  New Zealand  Au pairs are required to obtain a NZ Working Holiday Visa and will need at least 200 hours childcare experience prior to making an application. Au pairs are also required to undergo a police and medical background check. New Zealand au pair agencies work hard to safe- guard both the au pairs and host families' well-being. Most New Zealand au pair agencies are members of IAPA (International Au Pair Association) and will also require au pairs to implement the early childhood education curriculum, Te Whariki. Turkey Turkey is a transcontinental country that spans Europe and Asia; thus Turkish culture is heterogeneous and diversified. As culture and aspirations of this multi-ethnic country have recently turned to Europe, where the Au Pair Programs are especially popular, Turkey may be considered as one of the most popular non-EU country among the Au Pairs. Nevertheless, the Au Pair Programs are still something brand-new and unusual in Turkey, what makes it a great opportunity for both young people, tempted by a unique Turkish culture, and for families, looking for a reliable caregiver for their children. One of the biggest obstacles towards becoming flourishing centre of the Au Pairs‚Äô community is the visa requirement for foreigners. Entering Turkey without a valid visa is impossible for Au Pairs ‚Äì and to apply for a visa any potential Au Pair needs both an Au Pair contract and an invitation letter, what significantly reduces the number of people willing to make an effort and go through such a complicated application process. Europe Austria The tradition of au pairing is well established in Austria, and prospective au pairs are served by several agencies that are accustomed to dealing with direct applications from foreigners. Agencies often charge their au pairs a fee equivalent to a week's pocket money and will tell the au pair where to take the documents to be stamped for a fee. Officially, au pairs from outside Europe must obtain both a work and residence permit (Besch√§ftigungsbewilligung). The employing family should apply at their local employment office at least two weeks before the start date. Before the permit can be approved and an Anzeigebest√§tigung issued, the authorities must see an agreement or contract (signed by the employer and the au pair) and proof that health and accident insurance cover has been obtained by the au pair. Belgium In Belgium, au pairs must take part in a Dutch, French, or German language course (according to the region) offered by an officially recognised institution ‚Äì private tuition, distance learning courses, or private school courses are not accepted. An au pair without a basic knowledge of the host country's language will have to attend an intensive language course upon arriving in Belgium. The host family will also prepare a cultural programme. Nationals of all countries (except the States of the European Union, Iceland, Monaco, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland) who want to stay more than three months in Belgium are subject to the visa/work permit requirement. Non-EU members who want to work as an au pair in Belgium must be in possession of: * a passport valid for at least one year * a recent certificate of good conduct covering the last five years * a medical certificate obtained from a doctor approved by the Embassy * an employment authorization, which must be requested by the Belgium host family and issued along with the work permit B. * The application must be submitted in time to allow for a possible investigation by the Foreign Office. Providing childcare is the main responsibility of an au pair, though the host family may also request some light housework. All tasks are defined in the official au pair contract and cannot be changed by the au pair or the host family. The au pair receives free board and lodging, and is entitled to food and accommodation in cases of illness and holidays. She also has her own bedroom and key to the house. The host family subscribes to health and accident insurance, as well as an insurance for potential repatriation costs for the au pair. In Belgium, an au pair is entitled to at least 450 euros pocket money per month, deposited to her bank account. The au pair is entitled to the full amount of monthly pocket money in cases of illness and during holidays. Au pairs are not allowed to work more than 4 hours a day (babysitting hours included) and 20 hours per week, spread out over a maximum of 6 days a week. Au pair are entitled to at least one day off per week and at least one whole weekend a month. Holiday entitlement is not regulated in Belgium, but it is recommended that an au pair receives a minimum of 2 weeks' holiday. Denmark In Denmark, an au pair must be between 18 and 30 years old, must be able to master at least one of the following languages: English, German, Danish, Swedish or Norwegian. The daily working schedule must be at least 3 and a maximum of 5 hours, that is between 18 and 30 hours a week. The au pair must have at least one weekday free. At least one free day a month should be a Sunday. The au pair is to be regarded as a family member that means being equal to the other family members and participating in the everyday life of the host family. In return for her/his work, the au pair receives board and lodging, pocket money (from 4,450 DKK 2020 level) and access to follow language courses at language schools. The au pair usually are allowed to stay with their host family maximum period of 24 months, but no longer than stated in the contract. Though, the au pair visa does not constitute the grounds for a settlement either work permit. The host family is responsible for the entry and return ticket to/from Denmark if the au pair comes from a country outside the EU / EEA or Switzerland. In addition, the host family is responsible for a one-time fee, which is intended to cover part of the state's expenses for the Danish language lessons. Finland An au pair's responsibilities also include light domestic work for a maximum of 25 hours per week. The au pair must have at least one full free day every week, and two successive free days at least every second week. The au pair has her/his own room, is provided with food, and is paid a weekly allowance amounting to at least ‚Ç¨280 per month (minimum set by Finnish law). Additionally, the host family will arrange a Finnish or Swedish language course to help the au pair communicate better with the children and get more out of his or her stay in Finland. Au pairs can stay with their host family for up to one year or negotiate a shorter stay. Anyone, except citizens of the Nordic countries or the EU/EEA countries, wishing to work in Finland as an au pair must apply for and receive a residence permit before entering Finland. Citizens of EU states, Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein or Switzerland must register their right to reside in Finland, but they do not need a residence permit. France Au pairing has long been a favored way for young women to learn French and, increasingly, for young men as well. The pocket money for au pairs in France is Euro 60 per week, plus, in most cases, a 20 euro a week contribution to language classes; in Paris families may also provide a carte Navigo (urban travel pass) which is worth 95 euros (approximately). Enrollment in a French language course is compulsory for non-European au pairs. While France does not have an official, government sponsored Au Pair Program, a number of established agencies belong to UFAAP, the Union Francaise des Associations Au Pair, an umbrella group set up in 1999, based at Europair Services in Paris. As such, many au pairs enter France using a student visa where au pairs are limited to working no more than 5 hours a day, 30 hours a week, and pay is generally between 250‚Äì300 Euros. ;Application criteria Potential au pairs must: * Be aged 17‚Äì27. * Have basic skills in French. * Be able to commit to a period of at least 10 months (most host families prefer Au Pairs who can stay for the school year from September to June). * Attend French language classes while in France (this is a requirement to obtain the Long-Stay Au Pair Visa). Germany Many independent agents are members of the Au Pair Society which has two offices in Germany and more than 40 members. The Society‚Äôs web site carries contact details for its members with links to agency web sites. Commercial au pair agencies do not charge a placement fee to incoming au pairs. The Au-Pair Society e.V. is a member of the International Au Pair Association (IAPA) and is also in a committee ECAPS (European Committee for Au-Pair Standards) where members of National Organisation from several European countries have defined new Standards for Au-Pair programme in Europe. Non-EU citizens no older than 24 can become au pairs through a German agency. Americans and Canadians do not need to apply for a residence and work permit before leaving their home countries; however, it is a general requirement that au pairs prove that they have studied German. The monthly pocket money for an au pair in Germany was raised to 260 euros ($300+) in 2006. The majority of families also give their au pairs a monthly travel pass and other benefits such as a contribution to course fees or travel expenses. ;Application criteria Potential au pairs must: * Be 18‚Äìabove. Italy In order to become an Au Pair in Italy, Au Pairs need to: * Be between 18 and 30 years old * Have a good command in Italian or English * Be entitled to a visa if they don't belong to any EU-country. In this case, the Italian embassy placed at the Au Pair's home country will decide to approve or deny the Au Pair's application. The Au Pair program in Italy establishes that: * Au Pairs will work a maximum of 30 hours per week * Au Pairs will have 4 weeks paid holiday for a 12-months stay * Au Pairs will have at least one day off per week * Au Pairs will earn a monthly amount of 260 euro * Au Pairs will pay for the travel expenses to the Host Family's country Additional information: * Au Pairs who belong to a non-EU country member will have to apply for a visa. For that, visa requirements must be fulfilled and documents must be provided to the Italian embassy placed in their home country * Au Pairs from a non-EU country will need to close a private insurance from their home country * Au Pairs who come from any EU-country can apply for the European Health Insurance Card It is possible to apply independently through an Italian agency. There are many opportunities for au pairs during the summer holidays, when most Italians who can afford au pairs migrate to the coast or the mountains and take their helpers with them. The weekly pocket money is 75‚Äì95 euro for working 30 hours a week, and 100‚Äì130 euro for 40 hours, though many families in larger cities pay more than this. Non-European nationals are not eligible for a Permesso di Soggiorno (stay permit) unless they arrive with the appropriate visa from the Italian embassy in their country. The best route is to obtain a student visa which permits the holder to work up to 20 hours per week (live-in or live-out). To obtain a long-stay visa, non-EU au pairs will need to enroll in and pay for an Italian language course at an approved school or college. The school registrar will issue a certificate which must then be stamped by the local police office (Questura). The visa will be valid only for the length of the course. The applicant must show sufficient insurance coverage, a return air ticket, proof of accommodation stamped by the police and a contract specifying dates, pocket money and benefits stamped by the provincial labor office and/or the police. American citizens cannot legally work as au pairs on a working visa; the nulla osta will be denied because there are no labor agreements between the US and Italy in regards to au pairs. If the applicant is already in Italy she can check classified adverts in English language journals, many of which are published online such as Wanted in Rome aimed at the expatriate community, and notice boards in English language bookshops, English-speaking churches, student travel agencies, and language school notice boards. Netherlands Au pairs may only be placed with a host family in the Netherlands through an au pair agency recognized by the Immigration and Naturalisation Service (IND) of the Netherlands. Interested au pair candidates must be older than 18 but not yet 31 and interested in learning about Dutch society and culture. If you are an EU citizen, you do not need a visa to work as an au pair in the Netherlands. After you have been in the Netherlands for three months, you must register with the IND. When you register, you must provide documents to verify the purpose of your stay. After registering, you will receive proof of registration in the form of a sticker, which will be attached to your passport (or other proof of identity). As a Dutch national host family, if you wish to bring an au pair to the Netherlands for longer than 3 months, you must meet the following conditions: * Your family must consist of a minimum of 2 persons * You must support the au pair during his/her stay in the Netherlands * Au pair is registered in the Municipal Personal Records Database (GBA) * Your family must have sufficient income to support the au pair and yourselves * Family must publish a daily schedule of duties The au pair must have the following documents and meet the following conditions: * A valid passport * Health insurance that covers the au pair in the Netherlands * Cannot be married * Cannot have dependents or be responsible for the care of his/her family members * He/she does not constitute a risk to the public order * He/she must undergo a tuberculosis test in the Netherlands * He/she is over 18 but not older than 31 * He/she has not previously stayed in the Netherlands on a residence permit * He/she did not previously work for your family abroad * He/she will only carry out light domestic work to assist your family * He/she will work a maximum of 8 hours per day and a maximum of 30 hours per week; you will have 2 days off per week Placement period An au pair in the Netherlands is allowed to stay for a maximum of one year. Duties Providing childcare and doing light household chores are the main responsibilities. A daily schedule of duties is drawn up by the host family. Pocket money In the Netherlands, an au pair receives 300-340 euros pocket money per month. Board and lodging An au pair receives free board and lodging, and is entitled to board and lodging in cases of illness and holidays. Working hours In the Netherlands, the weekly working schedule of an au pair must not exceed a total of 30 hours. He/she may never work more than 8 hours a day or more than 5 days per week. Additional babysitting for the host family or taking on a job on the side is also not allowed. Free time An au pair in the Netherlands is entitled to a minimum of two days off per week; however, these days do not have to be consecutive. Holiday An au pair in the Netherlands is entitled to a minimum of 2 weeks paid holiday per 12 months. He/she and the host family can take this value as a basis for calculating the amount of holiday in case of a shorter placement. Language course/cultural exchange An au pair is entitled to attend a language course. The host family assists in finding suitable offers within their area, and contributes 320 euros per year to a language course. The au pair programme in the Netherlands is explicitly designed for a cultural exchange. Therefore, the host family will help the au pair to experience Dutch culture through various cultural activities. Norway The number of au pairs in Norway have been on the rise since 2000, more than quadrupling between the years 2000 and 2014. 81 percent of au pairs were females from the Philippines. In 2015, there were around 3000 au pairs in Norway. To compare, in 2000, there were 691 au pairs with the permit to stay in Norway. = Rights and regulations = As of April 2019, the host family is required to pay the au pair a minimum of NOK 5900 per month (pre-tax) as pocket money/salary. Since the au pair programme is a cultural exchange programme, the au pair also has the right to attend courses in Norwegian. The host family must provide a minimum of NOK 8850 pre-tax for the au pair's Norwegian lessons and study materials. The au pair's additional rights include, among other things: free board and lodging; holiday pay in accordance with the Holidays Act; and one full day (24 hours) off per week. The au pair is required to pay taxes. According to regulations [as of 2016] \\"the period of work shall normally not exceed five hours per day, and the maximum shall be 30 hours a week\\". If a host family fails to follow the regulations, they can lose the right to have an au pair for one, two, or five years, according to a rule introduced in July 2013. If the host family commits an offense punishable by three months in prison or more, the host family quarantine could last up to 10 years. = Controversies regarding the au pair system = The au pair system has, in recent years, been a topic of dispute in the Norwegian public. According to lawyer Lene L√∏vdal, \\"The au pair scheme is all about cheap in-house female work force. The majority of the au pairs in Norway do not primarily come here for the cultural exchange. First and foremost they‚Äôre professional housemaids.\\" In 2013, the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet reported that au pairs in Norway occasionally show up at PTA meetings, in the place of children's parents. A documentary about au pairs in Norway, Herskap og tenarar (\\"masters and Servants\\"), was broadcast on the TV channel NRK in 2013. The documentary examines the rights of au pairs in Norway, and focuses particularly on recent cases of abuse and exploitation against some au pairs from the Philippines. In 2016 the government cancelled funding for Au-pair senteret (over the state budget); in a Dagsavisen article Kadra Yusuf said that \\"We have become a class-divided society and we have servantship. ... and the responsibility that goes along. The first step must be that the government keeps the au-pair center open. That, the masters (or the master race) can afford, or what?\\" = 2017 scheduled trial of four employers = A trial is scheduled to be held from 3 January 2017 until 18 January. Four persons - two married couples - are charged with wrongfully having claimed: that they only had one au pair; that the au pair was to participate in Norwegian language courses; and that the person would not be working as a housekeeper. In addition, all are charged with having violated Utlendingsloven (\\"foreigners act\\"): one count is in regard to trafficking of the type that is punishable for up to three years.  Spain  The minimum pocket money for au pairs is 55‚Äì60 euros a week. There are also opportunities for young people to stay with Spanish families in exchange for speaking English with the children without having any domestic or childcare duties. According to the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the holder of an au pair visa must be between 17 and 30 years of age. He/she has the following rights, among others: # Duration of the agreement, not longer than one year. # Participation in household chores and duties, not more than 5 hours daily. # Minimum of one complete free day a week. For the student \\"Au Pair\\" to attend to religious activities, one free day a month must be a Sunday. # Exact address where the student \\"Au Pair\\" will be residing with the host family, enjoying at the same time a certain degree of independence. # Determined monthly pocket money that the student \\"Au Pair\\" will receive. # Conditions that would allow either party to reject the Placement Agreement with an advance notice of two weeks. The Embassy requires both an offer of employment from the family, and a letter from an authorized educational institution in Spain, confirming the au pair's enrollment in a full-time course. The au pair must also provide \\"proof of economic means to cover living expenses and eventual return to the country of origin.\\" Sweden There is no need for an agency in order to become an au pair in Sweden. Au pairs need to be between 18‚Äì30, have a valid passport, and not have any children. The Swedish Migration Authorities require that the applicant has a definite interest in learning or using the Swedish language. He or she is also required to have a certificate of admission to a Swedish course at time of application. Au pairs should not work for more than 25 hours a week, and combined with studies cannot exceed 40 hours a week. The required monthly allowance is SEK 3500 before tax. As for tasks and rights, the official Swedish Migration Agency states: \\"An au pair is a person who lives with another family and is paid for child minding and light housework . The purpose of their stay in Sweden must be to obtain international experience and the opportunity to learn Swedish language and culture.\\" Switzerland The applicant must be a female between the ages of 17 (18 in Geneva) and 29 from Western Europe, North America, Australia, or New Zealand, stay for a minimum of one year and a maximum of 18 months, and attend a minimum of three hours a week of language classes in Z√ºrich, four in Geneva. Families in most places are required to pay half the language school fees of 500‚Äì1,000 Swiss francs for six months. Au pairs in Switzerland work for a maximum of 30 hours per week, plus babysitting once or twice a week. The monthly salary varies among cantons but the normal range is 590‚Äì740 Swiss francs after all deductions for tax and health insurance have been made. United Kingdom Au pairs now mainly come to the UK from the European Economic Area under European freedom of movement regulations. There are arrangements for Romanian and Bulgarian nationals wanting to come to the UK as au pairs. Historically, au pairs came to the UK under an Au Pair immigration category, which was closed in November 2008 Home Office when a new points- based system was introduced, which included a Youth Mobility Scheme under tier 5 of the points based system Youth Mobility Scheme for the nationals of Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand and Monaco. In the UK, there are many au pair agencies that provide assistance to families looking to engage au pairs. These agencies are all privately owned and are not regulated by the UK government. North America Canada Au pair programs do not exist in Canada in the same format as the rest of the world. The Canadian government has the live-in caregiver program, which has broader requirements than the au pair program. Standard qualifications are regulated federally, though conditions of employment are determined at a provincial level. Requirements include a minimum of six months of training or one year of compatible employment within the past three years, though exceptions and additional stipulations do apply. Such regulations and complicating bureaucratic procedures are the driving force behind the creation of live-in caregiver (or nanny) placement agencies, who act as a mediator between families, caregivers, and the government - providing support for documentation and advice on the program. United States Interest in the Au Pair Program in the United States began in 1987, when two educational and cultural exchange agencies were designated by the United States Information Agency (USIA) to conduct a program under the Fulbright‚ÄìHays Act of 1961. This would allow foreign nationals the opportunity to live with an American host family and participate directly in the home life of the host family. After testing the program with approximately 200 au pairs, Congress instructed that the program be continued. The Au Pair Program was officially enacted in 1989. In that same year, the program was expanded to include four additional agencies, and these agencies together became the original six government designated Au pair organizations in the United States. The United States au pair program offers qualified young people the opportunity to live and study in the U.S. for one or two years in exchange for providing up to 45 hours of childcare per week.Au Pair and EduCare. U.S. Department of State website. Retrieved 25 April 2009. The au pair program was recently granted permission from the U.S. Department of State to offer a second year extension au pair program (6, 9 or 12 months), as well as a summer au pair program. At the same time, the au pairs are required to complete an educational component of six semester hours of academic credit or its equivalent. At the end of one year, au pairs generally return to their home country, unless they and their host families choose to extend their stay for a further 6, 9, or 12 months. Alternatively, the au pair can choose to extend her period in the US with a different family. Most au pairs choose a family in a different part of the country, allowing them to have a new experience. In the US, au pairs are provided a private bedroom, meals, compensation tied to the minimum wage ($195.75 per week as of 24 July 2009Change in US au pair stipends for minimum wage increase (US Department of State)), 1 day off weekly plus a full weekend off each month, two weeks' paid vacation, and the first $500 toward the costs of required course work to be completed at an accredited institution of higher education in order to satisfy the requirements of the educational component of the program. Au pairs are not to work more than 10 hours per day or 45 hours per week, and are not to serve as general housekeepers or assume responsibility for household management. The US EduCare Au Pair Program is also available for families with school-age children. In this program, the au pair works a lower number of hours (not more than 10 hours a day and not more than 30 hours a week) for a weekly minimum wage of $146.81. The family pays $1000 in educational expenses, and the au pair is required to complete 12 hours of academic credit. Au pairs placed with families who have children under two years old must have at least 200 hours of child care experience with infants under two. Au pairs may only be placed in a family with an infant under three months old if a parent or other adult caregiver is also home and fully responsible for the infant. The Au Pair Program is administered by the US Department of State. Participating families and au pairs must work with one of the currently 12 approved agencies. Au pairs enter the United States on a J-1 visa. Some au pairs also use a tourist visa, which is illegal, since this document does not enable them to work in the USA. Breaking the law, these individuals endanger both themselves and their employers. According to the Internal Revenue Service, an au pair will almost always be a nonresident alien, and will be required to file a tax return on Form 1040NR or Form 1040NR-EZ to report his or her au pair wages. These wages, however, are not usually subject to social security and Medicare taxes because of the au pair's status as a J-1 nonimmigrant and as a nonresident alien. However, if the au pair had previously been in the United States as a student, teacher, trainee, or researcher in F, J, M, or Q nonimmigrant status, then the au pair might be a resident alien during his current stay in the United States, and might be subject to social security and Medicare taxes if his annual au pair wages exceed the applicable dollar threshold found in IRS Publication 926. If the au pair is a resident alien and his or her annual au pair wages exceed the applicable dollar threshold, then the host family must withhold social security and Medicare taxes and report them on Schedule H of Form 1040 and on Form W-2. The host family must apply for an Employer Identification Number (EIN) if it is required to withhold tax and file Form W-2. =Basic application criteria= Potential au pairs must be aged 18‚Äì26 (at the time of arrival) and have no criminal record. Unless you are in a federally funded exchange program, sponsor organizations charge participants program fees. Fees vary from sponsor to sponsor based on the exchange category, the sponsor‚Äôs program, program duration, etc. Be sure to check with your sponsor to get a breakdown of all costs and fees. =Au pair program types in the United States= Au pairs in the United States are categorized by program types. Most au pair organizations in the United States classify au pairs by the following programs: Standard Au Pair Program The Standard Au Pair program is the most popular program available. Standard au pairs can work up to 45 hours per week and no more than 10 hours per day. They are paid the standard stipend amount and fulfill the minimum educational requirement of 6 hours of academic credit or its equivalent during the program year. Families hosting standard au pairs are required to provide (up to) the first $500 toward the cost of the au pair's academic course work. Standard au pairs are usually available for a full year commitment and have a variety of qualifications. If a family has a child under the age of two, the au pair has to have at least 200 hours of experience. The weekly payment stipend for an Au Pair is U$ 195.75 per week, being U$ 4.35/hour. Professional Au Pair Program The Professional Au Pair program is for families who need more than just a babysitter and have higher child care needs, due to a new baby, multiple children or children with special needs. Professional au pairs have degrees in child care related fields such as pre-school teacher, pediatric nursing or occupational therapy for children or one year full-time experience with children. A professional au pair can work up to 45 hours per week and no more than 10 hours per day. They are paid a higher stipend amount and fulfill the minimum educational requirement of 6 hours of academic credit or its equivalent during the program year. Families hosting professional au pairs are required to provide (up to) the first $500 toward the cost of the au pair's academic course work. Professional au pairs are usually available for a full year commitment and have a variety of qualifications. Cost are typically higher for a special needs au pair. Numerous agencies offer professional Au Pair programs including Au Pair International and PROaupair. The Educare Program The Educare Program was created as an option for families with school aged children or families looking for part-time child care. According to the U.S. Department of State, the Educare Au Pair Program applies to families who require childcare before and after school and may not be placed with families that have preschool aged children except if other, full-time childcare plans have been made. Educare au pairs may work no more than 10 hours per day, and a maximum of 30 hours per week. Au Pairs participating in the Educare component receive 75 percent of the weekly rate paid to non-Educare participants. Educare au pairs must complete a minimum of 12 hours of academic credit or its equivalent during their program year. The host family is required to provide (up to) the first $1,000 toward the cost of the au pair's required academic course work. The Extension Program When the Au Pair Program started in the United States in 1989, au pairs were only allowed to stay in the country and work as au pairs for a 12-month period. In 2006, the U.S. Department of State allowed au pairs to legally extend their stay and work for 6, 9, or 12 additional months. The program's regulations state that the Department of State may approve extensions for the au pair participants. The request for an extension beyond the maximum duration of the initial 12-month program must be submitted electronically to the Department of Homeland Security's Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) no less than 30 calendar days prior to the expiration of the exchange visitor's initial authorized stay in any program. Repeat participation In 2008, the U.S. Department of State re- designated the au pair requirements and regulations and added a repeat participation clause that states a foreign national who enters the United States as an au pair exchange visitor program participant and who has successfully completed his or her program is eligible to participate again as an au pair participant, provided that he or she has resided outside the United States for at least two years following completion of his or her initial au pair program. The Au Pair Abroad Program (The Reciprocity Clause) With the creation of the Au Pair Program in the United States in 1989, the U.S. Department of State also added a reciprocity clause in the general program requirements which states that in the conduct of their exchange programs, official au pair sponsor agencies shall make a good faith effort to achieve the fullest possible reciprocity in the exchange of persons. Reciprocity means the participation of a US citizen in an educational and cultural program in a foreign country in exchange for the participation of a foreign national in the exchange visitor program. \\"Reciprocity\\" is interpreted broadly here; unless otherwise specified, reciprocity does not require a one-for-one exchange or that exchange visitors be engaged in the same activity. For example, exchange visitors coming to the United States for training in American banking practices and Americans going abroad to teach foreign nationals public administration would be considered a reciprocal exchange, when arranged or facilitated by the same sponsor. The Au Pair Summer Program (discontinued) The Au Pair Summer Program started in 2005, when the U.S. Department of State ran a three-year pilot program. The program was extended for an additional year before it was discontinued in 2009. The Au Pair Summer Program faced logistical complications with DS-2019 forms, visa approvals around the world and lack of interest from American host families in this particular program. Summer au pairs were exactly like standard au pairs, except their visas were granted for only a few months instead of a full year. Since 2009, none of the 13 U.S. Department of State sponsor agencies are allowed to offer this program for families in the United States. =Sponsoring au pair agencies in the United States= , the U.S. State Department listed fifteen designated sponsoring au pair agencies.List of Au Pair Sponsoring Agencies US State Department website. Retrieved August 2019. Host families typically pay these agencies an application fee and a program fee which varies from $7,500 to $10,500, depending on the agency used. The program fees cover expenses related to the arrival of the au pair and compliance with regulations governing the program. These include airfare, medical insurance, mandatory 32-hour education session on child development and safety and other expenses. Au pairs pay fees which vary depending on the US agency and the home country agency they use (if they do not apply directly to the US agency). Au Pair online profile An online profile is one of the most important steps for any au pair searching for a family. Families using the profile to get to know the au pair before scheduling an interview. It is therefore crucial that au pairs have a professional profile that is accessible at all times with a fully working contact form. Typically, an Au Pair online profile includes a candidate's personal and contact data, information on their professional background, skills, lifestyle habits, and work-related preferences. Au pairs need to be aware that having private information publicly available could be dangerous.

In 2007, negotiations between agencies in China and the United States were successful and the American Cultural Exchange became the first organization to bring a Chinese au pair to the United States. In March 2007, the first Chinese au pair arrived in the United States. Chinese au pairs are desirable by American host families, attributed to the growing number of Chinese baby adoptions and the desire of parents to teach their children Mandarin, to capitalize on China's economic influence.EconEdge (2006).

The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE, pronounced 'life') was a futures exchange based in London. In 2014, following a series of takeovers, LIFFE became part of Intercontinental Exchange, and was renamed ICE Futures Europe. Euronext acquired LIFFE in 2002, and were then in turn taken over by NYSE in 2007, to form NYSE Euronext. The main rationale for this transaction was to gain ownership of LIFFE. In the same manner, Intercontinental Exchange then purchased NYSE Euronext in 2013, principally to acquire LIFFE. History The London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE), established by Sir Brian Williamson started life on 30 September 1982, to take advantage of the removal of currency controls in the UK in 1979. The exchange modelled itself after the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. It initially offered futures contracts and options linked to short- term interest rates. In 1993 LIFFE merged with the London Traded Options Market (LTOM), adding equity options to its product range. This is when it changed its name to the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange. In 1996 it merged with the London Commodity Exchange (LCE), and, as a result, a range of soft and agricultural commodity contracts was added to its products offering. Trading was conducted by open outcry, where traders meet on the trading floor (in what is called the pit) to conduct trades. The Exchange was originally housed in the historic Royal Exchange building near Bank but then moved to Cannon Bridge in 1991. By the end of 1996, LIFFE was by far the biggest futures exchange in Europe, followed by the MATIF in Paris and the Deutsche Terminb√∂rse (DTB) in Frankfurt. The DTB was an electronic exchange founded in 1990 and the predecessor to Eurex. LIFFE's most-traded product was a futures contract on Bunds, the 10-year German Government Bond. The DTB offered an identical product but, as an electronic exchange, it had a lower cost base. The progress of DTB can be gauged from the fact that in mid-1997 the DTB had less than 25% of the market. By October, it had more than 50%, and a couple of months later LIFFE was left with only 10%. The Bund represented about a third of LIFFE's business. The exchange, which had turned in a profit of ¬£57m in 1997, reported a loss of ¬£64m in 1998. Its ambitious plans for enlarged trading floor and offices on a site near Spitalfields market were dropped (and became the ABN Amro UK HQ). Move to electronic trading LIFFE had had big plans to expand, and intended to redevelop Spitalfields Market in the City of London as they needed a larger building for their open outcry. With the loss of the market for their main product, Bund futures contracts, all expansion plans were shelved. LIFFE realised that, to compete, it had urgently to develop an electronic trading platform instead. It already had an electronic platform called Automated Pit Trading (APT), which was used in after-hours trading when the trading pit was closed. LIFFE now developed a new trading platform, LIFFE CONNECT, for all trading, including the exchange's range of short-term interest rate derivatives contracts. After the creation of the euro in 1999 the exchange won the lion's share of trading in euro-denominated short-term interest rate derivatives ‚Äì the EURIBOR contract. On Friday 24 November 2000, at 5 pm, the last three of the once 26 open outcry pits were permanently closed. The design of LIFFE CONNECT made it possible for customers to choose which trading software they would use. LIFFE intended that this flexibility would encourage traders around the world to link to the exchange. And, by the beginning of 2002, customers in 25 countries around the world were trading on LIFFE. This completed a revolution in LIFFE's business: whereas traders had once had to come to LIFFE; now, through LIFFE CONNECT, LIFFE took its market to its customers wherever they were in the world. Seeing LIFFE CONNECT's potential, the Blackstone Group and Battery Ventures invested ¬£44m in Liffe to finance the commercial development of the trading platform so that it could be sold to other exchanges. Liffe went on to sell the technology to three exchanges, TIFFE (now renamed the Tokyo Financial Exchange) (2001), the Chicago Board of Trade (2003) and the Tokyo Stock Exchange (2008). Early in 2001 LIFFE said that it had returned to profit. In September that year the exchange announced that it had received a number of expressions of interest in buying the business. In January 2002, LIFFE was acquired by Euronext, joining the exchanges of Amsterdam, Brussels, Paris and Lisbon. References *Durica, Dr. Michael (2006).

It can extend to an entire lifestyle that precludes animal products from all aspects of life. Besides food, vegans may also choose to avoid clothes that use products such as leather and fur, cosmetics that have been tested on animals, and blood sports such as bullfighting and fox hunting. People who adopt veganism for ethical reasons may avoid or boycott all products or activities whose production or undertaking is perceived to exploit animals.

(in Hebrew: all draught beers, 1 + 1 free) Happy hour is a marketing term for a time when a venue (such as a restaurant, bar, bowling alley, stadium, state fair, or county fair) offers discounts on alcoholic drinks. Free appetizers and discounted menu items are often served during happy hour. Origin The words \\"happy\\" and \\"hour\\" have appeared together for centuries when describing pleasant times. In act I, scene 2 of William Shakespeare's King Henry V, he says, \\"Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour/That may give furtherance to our expedition...\\" The use of the phrase \\"happy hour,\\" to refer to a scheduled period of entertainment is, however, of much more recent vintage. One possible origin of the term \\"Happy Hour,\\" in the sense of a scheduled period of entertainment, is from the United States Navy. In early 1913, a group of \\"home makers\\" called the \\"Happy Hour Social\\" organised \\"semi-weekly smokers\\" on board . The name \\"Happy Hour Club,\\" \\"Happy Hour Social Club,\\" and similar variants, had been in use as the names of social clubs, primarily by women's social clubs, since at least the early 1880s. By June 1913, the crew of Arkansas had started referring to their regularly scheduled smokers as \\"Happy Hours.\\" The \\"Happy Hours\\" included a variety of entertainment, including boxing and wrestling matches, music, dancing, and movies. By the end of World War I, the practice of holding \\"Happy Hours\\" had spread throughout the entire Navy. The idea of drinking before dinner has its roots in the Prohibition era. When the 18th Amendment and the Volstead Act were passed banning alcohol consumption, people would host \\"cocktail hours\\", also known as \\"happy hours\\", at a speakeasy before eating at restaurants where alcohol could not be served. Cocktail lounges continued the trend of drinking before dinner. The Random House Dictionary of American Slang dates \\"Happy hour,\\" as a term for afternoon drinks in a bar, to a Saturday Evening Post article on military life in 1959. The article detailed the lives of government contractors and military personnel who worked at missile- tracking facilities in the Caribbean and the Atlantic. \\"Except for those who spend too much during 'happy hour' at the bar ‚Äì and there are few of these ‚Äì the money mounts up fast.\\" Barry Popick's online etymology dictionary, The Big Apple, lists several pre-1959 citations to \\"Happy Hour\\" in print, mostly from places near Naval bases in California, from as early 1951. Regulations Canada The Province of Alberta created restrictions to happy hours that took effect in August 2008. All such promotions must end at 8:00 p.m, and drink prices must conform to the Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission's minimum price regulations at all times.Alberta sets new rules to improve bar safety:Minimum drink prices, restricted happy hours among new policies to curb binge drinking. Alberta News Release, July 3, 2008. In Ontario, while establishments may vary liquor prices as long as they stay above the minimum prices set by the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario, they are not permitted to advertise these prices \\"in a manner that may promote immoderate consumption.\\" In particular, the phrase \\"happy hour\\" may not be used in such advertisement.:Pricing and Promotion of Liquor by Liquor Sales Licensees. Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario Information Bulletin, July 2007. Ireland Happy hour has been illegal in the Republic of Ireland since 2003, under the Intoxicating Liquor Act.Happy hour to end at midnight RT√â News (17 August 2003) Netherlands The KHN, a hospitality sector lobby group, has agreed with its members to stop happy hours to discourage binge drinking by youth, but only if the government would vote to not raise the minimum drinking age.DutchNews.nl - End of happy hours in sight - if the legal drinking age remains 16 In March 2013, the law to raise the drinking age to 18 was passed. United Kingdom The National Mandatory Licensing Conditions introduced in 2010 required \\"all reasonable steps\\" to be taken to prevent irresponsible drinks promotions which effectively banned traditional happy hours. Under the 2014 revision to these conditions, the licensee \\"must ensure\\" such promotions do not take place, although there is a subjective test, that takes account of the kind of establishment and its track record, for any promotions that offer unlimited or unspecified alcohol free or for a fixed or discounted fee. =Glasgow= In 2004 Glasgow banned happy hours to reduce binge drinking. United States Massachusetts was one of the first U.S. states to implement a statewide ban on happy hours in 1984. Several other U.S. states also have similar restrictions. The reason for each ban varies, but include: to prevent drunk driving, avoid the nuisance to neighbors from loud crowds and public drunkenness, and to discourage unhealthy consumption of a large amount of alcohol in a short time. In 1984, the U.S. military abolished happy hours at military base clubs. In 2011, the Utah State Legislature passed a ban on happy-hours, effective on 1 January 2012. In July 2011, Pennsylvania extended the period of time for happy hour from two hours to four hours. In June 2012, happy hour became legal in Kansas after a 26-year ban. In July 2015, a 25-year happy hour ban was ended in Illinois. , happy hour bans existed in Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Indiana, Maine, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Utah, and Vermont. For other services By extension, certain file-hosting websites such as RapidShare and Megaupload use the term happy hour to designate periods during which users have complimentary access to certain premium features, such as increased bandwidth, elimination of queues, and bypassing of CAPTCHA verifications.

The station is owned by NOVA Entertainment along with sister station, smoothfm 95.3 Audience In 2014 Nova had a 4% share of the Sydney audience on average, which is en par with rival ABC FM. Kate, Tim & Marty was the highest rated Nova show receiving 2.9% of Sydney's Drive time audience. Smallzy's Surgery receives a 0.5% share for the nighttime slot and Fitzy & Wippa received an 0.9% of Sydney's Breakfast audience.http://www.gfk.com/au/Solutions/audience-measurement-and- insights/Documents/Market%20Snapshots/GfK_OnlineMarketSummary_2014_1_Sydney.pdf In November 2014, Nova held a 0.7% for breakfast and 2.6% share for drive time. History One of the driving forces behind the creation of Nova was the growing demographic of youth who were embracing the commercialised anti- pop movement fronted by such artists as Daft Punk and Spiderbait, but for whom Triple J, operated by the publicly funded Australian Broadcasting Corporation, had no commercial incentives to offer. Initially the music selection on Nova 96.9 was very similar to that of Triple J, and a number of the station presenters, most notably former breakfast hosts Merrick and Rosso, which were also former Triple J staff. However, while Triple J has retained its alternative style, Nova has drifted towards a more commercial format. Meanwhile, other stations have adopted Nova's more varied programming style, to the point where Nova is now hard to tell apart from other commercial FM stations. Along with its sister stations Nova 100 Melbourne, Nova 106.9 Brisbane, Nova 91.9 Adelaide and Nova 93.7 Perth, Nova claims to be Australia's leading brand in the Women of the 45-54 Age demographic. Since 2011 Nova 96.9 have been sponsoring A-League club Sydney FC.

New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 3 February 2019 Exterior of Harvington Hall He entered the English College, Rome, 5 November 1641 and was ordained a Catholic priest on 3 December 1645. He was sent on the English Mission 12 May 1648 under the aliases of Francis Johnson, and Dormore. For several years he said Mass for recusant households. He returned to Douai and on 1 January 1651, he joined the Order of Friars Minor at St. Bonaventure's Friary, taking the name Friar Joachim of St. Ann. He was soon named Master of novices, serving in that office until 1656, when he returned to England, under the name Francis Webb and settled in Worcestershire. There he became a Governor (Six Master) of the Royal Grammar School Worcester. Father Wall usually made his home at Harvington Hall, which had a number of priest-holes, thought to be the work of Nicholas Owen. After 22 years of ministry to the Catholics of the area, he was apprehended in December, 1678, at Rushock Court near Bromsgrove, where the sheriff's man had come to seek a debtor. He was tendered the Oath of Supremacy, and was committed to Worcester Gaol for refusing it. His trial was on 25 April 1679. A man whose vices he had reproved bore testimony to his priesthood, and he received sentence. He was then sent to London, and four times examined by Oates, Bedloe, and others in the hope of implicating him in the pretended plot; but was declared innocent of all plotting and offered his life if he would abjure his religion.

Tony had another brother called Gary, who played at under-21 level for England. He made his England debut in October 1992 against Canada, and went on to win a total of 27 English caps. Tony and Rory were the first brothers to play for England together since Harold and Arthur Wheatley in England's 1937 6-3 win over Scotland, and partnered in the 1995 Five Nations Grand Slam win. He played in the Rugby World Cup in 1995, and in the Quarter final match against Australia he scored a try that many regard as one of the finest in running Rugby, with his right-wing counterpart Damien Smith failing to tackle him, and that helped England to reach the Semi- finals. In the Semi-final he had another memorable moment in which his opposite number, Jonah Lomu, ran a ring around him, before powering straight over the tackle of full back Mike Catt to score what would be one of his four tries in that game. In 1995, he left Leicester for Newcastle Falcons. At Newcastle he made 11 appearances as they won the 1997-98 Premiership. His last cap for England came in December 1998 against South Africa where he was replaced early; England went on to win. He would later star in a famous Pizza Hut advert alongside Lomu.

He made some important contributions to the differential geometry of surfaces, including the Gauss‚ÄìBonnet theorem. Biography Early years Pierre Bonnet attended the Coll√®ge in Montpellier. In 1838 he entered the √âcole Polytechnique in Paris. He also studied at the √âcole Nationale des Ponts et Chauss√©es. Middle years In graduating he was offered a post as an engineer. After some thought Bonnet decided on a career in teaching and research in mathematics instead. Turning down the engineering post had not been an easy decision since Bonnet was not well off financially. He had to do private tutoring so that he could afford to accept a position at the Ecole Polytechnique in 1844. One year before this, in 1843, Bonnet had written a paper on the convergence of series with positive terms. Another paper on series in 1849 was to earn him an award from the Brussels Academy. However between these two papers on series, Bonnet had begun his work on differential geometry in 1844. Bonnet was elected to the Academy of Sciences in 1862 to replace Biot. He defeated Bour for this position. From 1868 Bonnet assisted Chasles at the Ecole Polytechnique, and three years later he became a director of studies there. In addition to this post he also taught at the Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure. In 1878 Bonnet succeeded Le Verrier to the chair at the Sorbonne, then in 1883 he succeeded Liouville as a member of the Bureau des Longitudes. Bonnet did important work on differential geometry. In addition Serret, Frenet, Bertrand and Puiseux worked in France on this topic. Bonnet made major contributions introducing the notion of geodesic curvature. A formula for the line integral of the geodesic curvature along a closed curve is known as the Gauss‚ÄìBonnet theorem. Gauss published a special case. Independently of Ferdinand Minding, Bonnet showed the invariance of the geodesic curvature under bending. Between 1844 and 1867 he published a series of papers on the differential geometry of surfaces. In 1859 he submitted an important memoir for the Grand Prize of the Paris Academy. The prize was to find all surfaces of a given linear element.

He played in the centres, mainly as an inside centre. He is the son of Dick Greenwood, who was a former England coach. Early life Born 20 October 1972 in Blackburn, Lancashire, Greenwood was educated at St Mary's Hall and Sedbergh School, where he was in the first team for rugby and cricket. As a schoolboy, he was also a talented cricketer and played for the Lancashire Schools representative team before ultimately deciding to concentrate on rugby. He graduated with a BA in Economics from Hatfield College, Durham in 1994. Career Club Greenwood played his club rugby for the London-based Harlequins, having also played for Preston Grasshoppers, Waterloo and Leicester Tigers. As rugby had yet to turn professional, he moved to London and worked as a trader at a bank before joining Harlequins. He eventually left Harlequins and moved to Leicester Tigers in 1996 because the presence of England centre Will Carling meant he could not get first team rugby. Subsequently, picked by new England coach and ex-Tigers centre Clive Woodward he became an important part of that team, notably establishing a centre partnership with Jeremy Guscott. In 2000 he moved back from Tigers to 'Quins after succumbing to poor form, not helped by the arrival of Australian Pat Howard that prevented him from getting first team rugby. His match-winning try to defeat Brive, in the European Shield quarterfinal on 27 January 2001, was voted the club's 2000/01 'Try of the Year'. He had already picked up an RFU Cup winner's medal with Tigers but this time tasted defeat in the final of the same competition with NEC Harlequins, at the hands of Newcastle Falcons in 2001. Greenwood decided to extend his contract with the Harlequins when they were relegated to the National League 1. He retired at the end of the 2005/06 season after helping them regain promotion. International After being overlooked by England coach Jack Rowell, he was selected for the British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa still uncapped, and ahead of then England captain Phil de Glanville, in the summer of 1997. During the tour, he swallowed his tongue on the pitch after a collision and stopped breathing for several minutes, and did not play in any of the tests. This was one of the few games where Greenwood, contrary to his superstition, wore a number 12 jersey. He was handed his England debut later that year. Greenwood rebounded and cemented his place in the England team for the Six Nations and World Cup in 2003. He formed a centre partnership with Mike Tindall or Mike Catt and notably wore the number 13 even if he played inside centre. He was involved in all but one of England's games in the World Cup. Although he had rushed home due to his wife's difficult pregnancy, he returned to the side, scoring England's only try against South Africa, when he followed up to touch down after a Lewis Moody charge down. His try against Wales in the quarter-final in Brisbane turned the match for England in a tight game. He finished the tournament as joint top try scorer with five. He was made vice captain under Lawrence Dallaglio for the 2004 Six Nations tournament. He reached the 50 cap landmark against Ireland and played in all of England's Six Nations matches. At the start of the 2004/5 season he stood on 30 tries. He won the last of 55 England caps against Australia in 2004. In 2005 Greenwood was injured for the Six Nations, but was selected for the British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand, his third Lions tour. He replaced Brian O'Driscoll just two minutes into the first test against New Zealand and also played in the third test. After 55 England English rugby union caps and 31 tries he announced his retirement at the end of the 2005/6 season Post Retirement He found a job working as an analyst for Sky Sports and regularly appears on 'The Rugby Club' and live premiership matches, as well as being (with Scott Quinnell) the co-presenter of the School of Hard Knocks Sky TV series. During the 2007 Rugby World Cup, Greenwood was employed by ITV as an analyst for live matches.

His minions appeared before him (but only alluded to him), in issue #132. Fictional character biography Herbert Edgar Wyndham was born in Manchester, England. While a student at Oxford in the 1930s, he took an interest in the work of genetic biologist Nathaniel Essex, and began experimenting with genetic manipulation, building a machine (that he called the genetic accelerator) with which he attempted to \\"evolve\\" the rats in his mother's London basement. While attending a genetics conference in Geneva, Wyndham was approached by a mysterious man (who was in truth the outcast Inhuman geneticist Phaeder) who handed to him papers containing blueprints for cracking the genetic code. With this information to bolster his experiments, Wyndham successfully developed a serum he dubbed \\"Isotope A\\".X-Factor Annual #3 (August 1988). Marvel Comics. Phaeder hands Wyndham the papers to break the genetic code. Although expelled from the university for his single-mindedness, he finally succeeded in evolving his pet Dalmatian Dempsey into a humanoid life form with the intelligence of a chimpanzee. However, Dempsey was shot by poachers and Wyndham realized that such creatures as he would create would have no place in the human world. In partnership with scientist Jonathan Drew (father of Jessica Drew), Wyndham moved his experiments to the seclusion of Wundagore Mountain in the small Balkan nation of Transia. Discovery of uranium on the land (inherited by Drew's wife) provided vast funding, and they bought more land from local baron Gregor Russoff.Punisher Annual #1 (August 1988). Marvel Comics. Assembling a \\"citadel of science\\" designed by German scientist Horace Grayson (father of the future Marvel Boy) and built by Moloid slaves supplied by Phaeder, the pair continued their experiment until Drew's daughter fell ill from uranium poisoning, and was placed into suspended animation to save her life.Silver Surfer Annual #1 (August 1988). Marvel Comics. Subsequently, Drew's wife was attacked and killed by a werewolf (Russoff himself, victim of a family curse), and Drew left Wundagore. Wyndham, on the other hand, developed a suit of protective silver armor for himself and continued his work.Fantastic Four Annual #21 (September 1988). Marvel Comics. Now joined in his work by research assistant Miles Warren (who would later become Jackal), Wyndham was able to make more and more radical breakthroughs, including the genetic acceleration of some local animals into the half-human, half-animal beings that he dubbed his \\"New Men\\".Thor #135 (December 1966). Marvel Comics. When Jonathan Drew returned to Wundagore where he was possessed by the ghost of the 6th century magician Magnus, he warned that the citadel had been constructed upon the place where the malevolent Elder God Chthon had been banished. He began to train the New Men in the ways of combat and chivalry of his time, until they eventually came to refer to themselves as the \\"Knights of Wundagore\\", and to Wyndham as the \\"Lord High Evolutionary\\".The Amazing Spider-Man Annual #22 (September 1988). Marvel Comics. In 1958, Magnus's fears came to pass when Baron Russoff attempted to use the ancient magical tome known as the Darkhold to cure himself of his lycanthropy, inadvertently freeing Chthon from imprisonment. The Knights held him off and Magnus was able to re-bind Chthon. However, on this same night, a pregnant woman named Magda sought refuge at the citadel and gave birth to twin children there. Although she fled after childbirth, the moment of Chthon's defeat coincided with the birth of the children, and the baby girl was touched with the demon's magic. Wyndham attempted to find foster parents for the children, but when met with failure, they were placed in stasis for decades until suitable candidates were found. Raised by Roma Django and Marya Maximoff, the twins grew up to be the superheroes Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch, the latter wielding chaos magic as a result of Chthon's influence.Web of Spider-Man Annual #4.

Wyndham eventually saw the world as a far too confining place, so he converted his scientific research citadel into a spaceship, exploring the stars with his New Men. He later settled his New Men on a planet, Wundagore II, while he stayed on one of the planet's moons and began work on a detailed replica of Earth to be located on the opposite side of the Sun. There his New Men regressed to bestial behavior and revolted against him. He captured the Hulk, intending to evolve him forward by a million years. However, his experiment was interrupted by the New Men, who fatally wounded their former master. In desperation, he performed the experiment meant for the Hulk on himself, evolving into a godlike being. In this enlightened state, he was repulsed by his tampering with evolution and devolved the surviving New Men before willing his own existence to dissolve and become one with the cosmos.Tales to Astonish #94-96. Marvel Comics. The High Evolutionary eventually returned to human form and finished his creation, Counter-Earth. Although Counter-Earth was supposed to be a temporary structure that would be evolved into a paradise, the Man-Beast corrupted the process, and Counter- Earth became an imperfect world. By this time the High Evolutionary had adopted Adam Warlock and bestowed him with the Soul Gem, dispatching him to redeem Counter-Earth.Marvel Premiere #1-2; Warlock #1. Marvel Comics. The High Evolutionary aided Adam Warlock against Man-Beast and his agents.Warlock #3, 5, 8. Marvel Comics. Eventually, one of Galactus's Heralds discovered this Counter-Earth. Galactus declared that Counter-Earth was ideally suited for his sustenance (just as the real Earth). The High Evolutionary faced Galactus in battle and lost, while the Fantastic Four and Gorr tried to prevent Galactus from devouring Counter-Earth; eventually the Impossible Man tricked the World Devourer to seek sustenance from the Impossible Man's world, Poppup, leading to a fatal condition. Out of compassion, the High Evolutionary saved Galactus by evolving him into living energy that was eventually re-collected by Galactus's world ship.Fantastic Four #172-175. Marvel Comics. During the earliest phases of its construction, the High Evolutionary's Counter-Earth was aggressively targeted for \\"collection\\" by the Beyonders (not to be confused with the Beyonder). Agents of the Beyonders manipulated Adam Warlock into murdering the High Evolutionary to allow theft of Counter-Earth, but he was revived by Moondragon and Warlock's counterpart, Her. When the High Evolutionary discovered the disappearance of Counter-Earth, alongside the Thing, Alicia Masters, Starhawk, Moondragon, and Her, the High Evolutionary pursued the Beyonders to rescue his world. When the High Evolutionary arrived at the Beyonders' planet museum, he himself reported that his mind snapped when he witnessed the scope of their powers and how effectively insignificant he was compared to these alien beings. It is this encounter that marks the beginning of the High Evolutionary's mental instability. Although the High Evolutionary claimed that the Beyonders considered Counter-Earth an \\"interesting but primitive work by a talented provincial\\", there has not been an explanation as to why they wished to interrupt the project even before the High Evolutionary had introduced life onto the new world. For unknown reasons, the Beyonders placed all life on Counter-Earth into stasis and later allowed the planet to be destroyed during the Infinity Gauntlet conflict, although they could easily have prevented it. The High Evolutionary War Avengers Annual #17. Art by Sal Buscema. The High Evolutionary had become increasingly unstable and maniacal. His attempt to end his life was prevented by his suit. He returned to Earth, hoping to find something strong enough to overcome his armor. He goaded the Hulk into attacking him, and Hulk succeeded in smashing his armor; the malfunctioning armor then devolved the High Evolutionary into a mass of one-celled organisms.The Incredible Hulk #266 (December 1981). Marvel Comics. However, the suit's circuits reorganized and restored the High Evolutionary to his previous state. His death and subsequent rebirth gave the High Evolutionary a new insight into the future of mankind. Rather than being a benevolent yet distant protector, as he had been with his New Men, he would take a direct hand in molding the future of humanity, so that they might one day be as powerful as the Beyonders he had witnessed.Avengers Annual #17 (November 1988).

The High Evolutionary later came into conflict with a number of superheroes, notably the reserve Avengers and Adam Warlock, when he tried to forcibly mutate (or \\"evolve\\") the entire population of the Earth with his \\"Evolution Bomb\\". The Avengers stopped him, though the High Evolutionary and Hercules were exposed to the High Evolutionary's Genesis Chamber and became \\"more than a god\\", evolving out of existence.Punisher Annual #1; Silver Surfer Annual #1; New Mutants Annual #4; Fantastic Four Annual #21; Amazing Spider-Man Annual #22; X-Men Annual #3; Web of Spider-Man Annual #4; West Coast Avengers Annual #3; Spectacular Spider-Man Annual #8; Avengers Annual #17. Marvel Comics. The evolved essences of the High Evolutionary and Hercules were harvested by the Celestials and imprisoned and manipulated for unknown purposes in the Black Galaxy. Eventually both were returned to human form, and the High Evolutionary returned to space with the Knights of Wundagore. After Thor shaved his beard, one of the New Men brought the shaving bowl containing Thor's blood and hair to Count Tager as part of the High Evolutionary's plot to create a new race of immortals.Thor #406-408. Marvel Comics. After his liberation, the High Evolutionary decided that rather than advancing humanity, he would create all-new gods and immortals using the unique matter that composed the Black Galaxy, including the New Immortals consisting of Analyzer, Count Tagar, Juvan, Nobilus (who was created from Thor's DNA samples), and Zon. He and his creations were on-hand to witness the birth of a new Celestial, but viewing this event with all his hyper-evolved senses seemed to drive the High Evolutionary back to madness.Thor #419-425. Marvel Comics. At one point, Ego the Living Planet was investigated by the High Evolutionary, who observed Ego while a titanic, cloud-like entity - which he tentatively designated \\"Super-Ego\\" - absorbed Ego. The High Evolutionary theorized that there was more than one Ego (a notion supported by its apparently erratic behavior over the years, the various origin stories known about it, and by the fact that an Ego appeared after this one was destroyed by its \\"parent\\") and that they might all stem from the \\"Super-Ego\\". His mental instability progressed to the point that the High Evolutionary became infatuated with Shanna, wife of Ka-Zar. Infused with the power of the Savage Land's terraformer (commissioned by the Beyonders), she had become much like the High Evolutionary himself: powerful, well-meaning, and mentally unstable. The two became obsessed with each other, and nearly departed Earth to create a new world of their own, but Ka-Zar convinced Shanna otherwise. The High Evolutionary repented, agreeing to return Shanna to her normal state once he realized (despite his mania) that the relationship should not be pursued. The High Evolutionary once helped to restore the Savage Land and its inhabitants after the engines that kept the volcanoes active were demolished by Terminus.Uncanny X-Men Annual #12 (October 1988). Marvel Comics. Subsequent whereabouts The High Evolutionary was revealed to have a student called the High Technician who was responsible for creating a team of uplifted dinosaurs called the Saur-Lords during his time in the Savage Land.Captain America #415 (May 1993). Marvel Comics. In the Quicksilver series, it was revealed that the High Evolutionary's genetic code had become unstable, accounting for his periods of mania and aggression. The High Evolutionary became more powerful and maniacal than ever, but Quicksilver was still able to reason with him. With the support of New Men Delphis and Bova, and after nearly losing his life at the hands of the Man-Beast, the High Evolutionary was able to restore himself to an un-evolved human state and mental stability using Isotope G.Heroes for Hire & Quicksilver Annual 1998. Marvel Comics. The High Evolutionary is now an occasional ally of Thor and other superheroes. He confronted his mentor Mister Sinister alongside the X-Men when the villain took over his satellite-based device (which temporarily shut down the X-Gene of all Earth-based mutants, devolving them into normal humans) and altered it, in a test-of-evolution scheme by force-evolving the entire global human populace. He was seen in the X-Men: Endangered Species one-shot as one of the nine villains Beast approaches to help him reverse the effects of M-Day. In the second chapter of the Endangered Species storyline, Beast attempts to reach Wundagore Mountain to locate the High Evolutionary. The Knights of Wundagore confront and ultimately escort Beast inside, where the High Evolutionary appears to him as a hologram, giving Beast only cryptic and mostly dismissive answers. Spider-Man spoke to him during One More Day on whether he could do anything to save the life of Aunt May. He could give no useful help.Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man #24. Marvel Comics. During the Annihilation Conquest event, the High Evolutionary reappeared in Kree space, working on restructuring the Kree genome in a fortress inside a star. Adam Warlock brought Quasar and Moondragon to him after being overwhelmed by Phalanx warriors, who quickly invaded the High Evolutionary's vessel. Once Ultron was revealed to be the leader of the Phalanx militia, the High Evolutionary detonated the star, vaporizing his ship, Ultron, and the invading Phalanx warriors. He subsequently was captured by the Phalanx and forced to transfer the essence of Ultron into the body of Adam Warlock, apparently killing him. However, the High Evolutionary was aware that Warlock's consciousness had survived and implied that Warlock would \\"lead the way\\" for the new Guardians of the Galaxy. Recently, the High Evolutionary has begun working with Magneto and Blob to determine why so many mutants were depowered on M-Day. He developed a suit for the depowered Magneto that replicated his original powers, and Magneto led an attack on San Francisco as a distraction so that the High Evolutionary could gain a currently unknown object from inside of the Dreaming Celestial.Uncanny X-Men #500. Marvel Comics. After extensively examining the Dreaming Celestial, the High Evolutionary subjected Magneto to an extremely dangerous technological procedure in an attempt to restore his power and was a success.Uncanny X-Men #507. Marvel Comics. High Evolutionary had a part in turning an ordinary zoo hippopotamus into the Hippo.Dark Reign: The Sinister Spider-Man #2. Marvel Comics. Although not inhabiting Mt. Wundagore at the time, the High Evolutionary still maintained a garrison there where Chthon re-emerged and slaughtered many of the remaining New Men.Mighty Avengers #21. Marvel Comics. Doctor Doom and Mister Fantastic later had the Future Foundation members gather the other geniuses to attend a symposium on how to defeat the \\"Council of Reeds\\" (alternate versions of Mister Fantastic who were trapped in this universe by Valeria a while back, possessing Reed's intellect while lacking his conscience). High Evolutionary was one of those given the invitation from Thing and the evolved Moloids.FF #3. Marvel Comics. He later drained the Silver Surfer's Power Cosmic into himself, rendering the Surfer mortal and giving the High Evolutionary the ability to control and modify the star sphere of the civilization-destroying entity Galactus, allowing him to bestow life to dead worlds. The High Evolutionary created a herald for himself as well as a silver-coated biome of life on Earth, which needed only sunlight to survive, without the need to kill other animals. The Surfer and the Fantastic Four unite with the armed forces to kill all the High Evolutionary's creations on the grounds that they consider harmonic life without greed and bloodthirst as \\"unworthy of existence\\". They again exterminate the High Evolutionary's creations after he begins to terraform the Moon, on the rationale that it might affect tides and animal migrations. Galactus arrives, and the Fantastic Four cheer on Galactus to kill Wyndham, but as the High Evolutionary now serves an equal opposite \\"World Builder\\" function of creating rather than committing genocide on sentient civilizations, he allows the High Evolutionary to leave with his star sphere to continue creating new life throughout the universe.Silver Surfer limited series 2011, issues 1-5. Marvel Comics. When the High Evolutionary learned that the god-like Celestials were coming to Earth to judge whether humanity should continue to exist or perish, he‚Äîwith the help of the Evolutionaries‚Äîsystematically began to slaughter his creations, fearing that their unnatural presence may cause the Celestials to deem the planet unworthy.New Warriors Vol. 5 #6. Marvel Comics. The High Evolutionary has appeared in the 2015 Uncanny Avengers series. He has apparently created a new Counter-Earth, no longer inhabited by humans but instead by millions of New Men. The High Evolutionary routinely exterminates the entire population of New Men when they ultimately fail to meet his standards of perfection and then re- creates them. He was served in his plans by a human called the Master Scientist and Luminous (a female who was created from the genetic templates of Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch while also having the same abilities as them). A human called the Low Evolutionary was one of a few humans living on Counter- Earth who opposed the High Evolutionary.Uncanny Avengers #1-2. Marvel Comics. After being tracked down and defeated by Luminous, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch were brought to the High Evolutionary himself. He revealed to them that Django and Marya Maximoff were their true parents. He also told them the truth where they were supposedly not mutants, but they had been experimented on by the High Evolutionary. The High Evolutionary later confronted the Avengers Unity Division when they interfered with his plan to destroy Lowtown (a refuge for a resistance formed by the High Evolutionary's rejects, led by the Low Evolutionary).Uncanny Avengers #4. Marvel Comics. He was defeated after Doctor Voodoo unleashed upon him the thousands of souls of those he had exterminated and was forced to flee through a portal with Luminous.Uncanny Avengers #5. Marvel Comics. During the \\"Last Days\\" part of the Secret Wars storyline, it was mentioned months ago that the High Evolutionary was among the scientists that Magneto's right-hand person Briar tried to contact in order to make a special cocktail to augment Magneto's powers for the upcoming incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610.Magneto Vol. 3 #19. Marvel Comics. Maker collaborated with High Evolutionary to destroy the Superflow that kept the different universes separate in order to merge them into one reality. As a result of this action, the Earth-1610 Ultimates members Captain America, Iron Man, Giant-Man, Wasp, and Hulk were revived where they were to help Eternity fight the First Firmament.Ultimates 2 Vol. 2 #9. Marvel Comics. Continuing his work on Counter-Earth, the High Evolutionary used his technology to accelerate Counter-Earth so that he can have it combine with Earth. To help in that, the High Evolutionary sent a meteor to Earth that altered Earth's vibration frequencies where their synching will merge the two planets.Avengers #672-673. Marvel Comics. This plot attracted the attention of the Avengers and the Champions where Falcon and Viv are unexpectedly teleported to Counter-Earth and brought to the High Evolutionary. He decides to evolve them where he starts by turning Viv into a human. The Avengers and the Champions went to Counter-Earth and fought the New Men and then caused a malfunction with the High Evolutionary's teleporter where he seemingly perished.Champions #12-13. Marvel Comics. It was discovered during this time that the High Evolutionary had created a clone of himself called the Higher Evolutionary where he had more compassion than his creator and had been hooked up to the Orbit-Engine where his removal will destroy Counter-Earth.Avengers #674. Marvel Comics. The High Evolutionary was actually turned into sentient digital data and trapped in an unknown dimension. As he evolved the life on the planet that he landed on, he had a run-in with Viv who was also sent there as a side-effect of deactivating the Orbit-Engine and states that it would require a digital connection for him to return. Upon discovering that Vision is building Viv 2.0 to replace Viv, the High Evolutionary states that it would be their connection back to their reality. Viv used the connection to go back to her reality while the High Evolutionary was left in the unknown dimension.Champions Vol. 2 #15. Marvel Comics. At some point as part of the prelude to the \\"Hunted\\" storyline, Kraven the Hunter hunted some New Men in order to draw out the High Evolutionary. Kraven cuts a deal with the High Evolutionary to take his DNA sample and create 87 clones of him in order for them to go out into the world and prove themselves to Kraven. The High Evolutionary agrees to the terms and creates the clones.Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 5 #16. Marvel Comics. Characterization Powers and abilities The High Evolutionary has evolved his intelligence to the upper limit of human potential, and is the only human whose intelligence and knowledge has been listed as equal to certain cosmic entities.Fantastic Four Annual #23 He is considered the leading geneticist in the Marvel universe, and is vastly knowledgeable in biology, chemistry, medicine, physics, engineering, human psychology, computer science, and cybernetics. Due to experimentation on his own genome, his highly enhanced brain and cybernetic exoskeleton, the High Evolutionary has demonstrated god- like powers; including the ability to evolve and devolve life-forms, superhuman strength and durability, manipulating matter at a subatomic level, energy manipulation and projection, cosmic awareness, precognition, telepathy, telekinesis, extra-dimensional travel, and size alteration. On one occasion, he managed to hold his own against Galactus for a prolonged time before being defeated.Fantastic Four #175 Of note, the High Evolutionary has forged weapons for his New Men that show some anti-mystical properties, as demonstrated by a lance wielded by the Beast that was actually able to damage the Darkhold. His exoskeleton provides him with an uncanny degree of protection from attacks, and also provides life support (filtering/recycling his air and providing sustenance when needed). If he is badly damaged, the suit can heal his wounds and can completely restore him to life using records of his genome and brain activity patterns, as in one instance the suit restored him fully after he had attempted to commit suicide by destroying his own body. Personality The High Evolutionary's character has varied between that of a weary, well-meaning creator to that of a \\"mad scientist\\" who is willing to do whatever he considers necessary to further his goals of evolving a better, less-brutal world. He has great respect for the process of evolution, but is also deeply troubled by the immense amount of death and suffering required for such slow progress (see the Quicksilver series). Although menacing and arrogant during his maniacal phases, the High Evolutionary's history also contains more than one example of his desire to be responsible, creative, and kind. Most Marvel writers have resisted portraying him as a standard-fare villain, thereby adding levels of sympathy and complexity to the character. The High Evolutionary has been manipulated and driven to insanity by both the Beyonders and the Celestials, cosmic races that have interfered with human evolution in the past, indicating that his work might perhaps be a threat to their own. Even at his most unstable, the High Evolutionary has always demonstrated a paternal love toward even his most flawed creations: he rehabilitated Nobilus, has attempted to heal Count Tagar and the God Pack, and has spared the Man- Beast his life despite multiple attempts to murder him. At one point, he offered to (and did) restore the Savage Land after it was destroyed by Terminus, even though it had been created by the very race that had confiscated and then destroyed his own beloved creation, Counter-Earth. The High Evolutionary played a key role in saving the Earth from Chthon, and rescued Galactus from death despite his attempts to consume Counter-Earth. He has served as a benevolent father figure to several characters, including Adam Warlock, Quicksilver, Spider-Woman, Wolverine, and Thor, often charging them with tasks that lead to their personal growth as individuals and heroes. Along these lines, he has taken a pointed interest in developing a sense of nobility and decency in his creations, most notably the New Men. At times the High Evolutionary has feigned indifference to the fate of others when his own safety is at stake, only to reveal a considerably more benign agenda later (see the Annihilation: Conquest series). More frequently, he has shown a sympathetic and protective concern for the defenseless: on several occasions he has gone to considerable lengths to protect young children, including the critically ill Jessica Drew,Spider Woman #1 Wanda and Pietro Maximoff,Avengers #186 and Pietro's daughter Luna.Quicksilver #1 He gave Magda shelter from the elements without hesitation, risked death to fight Galactus over Counter- Earth, and literally begged Ka-Zar not to poison the Earth's biosphere with Isotope E out of compassion for the suffering it would cause.Ka-Zar vol. 4 #14 He tried to aid Magneto in reversing the effects of M-Day. He delayed an attack on the Silver Surfer to allow him time to save the life of Suzi Endo, who would briefly become his herald.Silver Surfer limited series #1 (2011) Though made personally wealthy by uranium deposits, the High Evolutionary has also provided for a generous financial trust for the people of Transia, ensuring economic stability for the nation. In other media Television * The High Evolutionary appeared in the X-Men animated series, voiced by James Blendick. In the episode \\"Savage Land, Savage Heart\\" [Pt. 2], he had a non-voiced appearance in a flashback, defeating and imprisoning Garokk in the Savage Land. Later in the episode \\"Family Ties\\", the High Evolutionary is shown to be the Master of Wundagore. When Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch came to Wundagore to find Lady Bova, he was unsure it was them at first until he used his machine to find out it was them. After Lady Bova reveals that Magneto is responsible for the twins' mother's death, the High Evolutionary told them that he was at a nearby cemetery and sends some of his warriors to accompany them. When Magneto is taken down, the High Evolutionary's New Men restrain Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. When Wolverine attacked, knock-out gas filled the area causing Wolverine, Magneto, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch to become the High Evolutionary's prisoners. He seeks to create a superior generation of his New Men by using mutant DNA, mutating humans into beast-like beings, instead of experimenting on animals. He sets up a trap to capture Magneto. After he reveals that fact and mentions to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch that Magneto is the twins' father, he takes Wolverine and uses his genetic machine to turn Wolverine into a werewolf-like monster. When Professor X and Beast arrived in Wundagore, the High Evolutionary instructed his New Men to bring Beast to him. After a brief fight with the X-Men, the High Evolutionary escapes with his New Men. The effects he caused on the valley his fortress was in were reversed as was Wolverine's transformation. The High Evolutionary as he appears in Spider-Man Unlimited. * The High Evolutionary appeared as a principal villain in Spider-Man Unlimited, voiced by Richard Newman. Disgusted with the behavior of humans on Earth, this version believed that a greater genetic diversity heightens survival traits. He departed Earth for Counter-Earth to begin anew, but found the same destructive tendencies in their humans as had plagued those he left behind. The High Evolutionary then proceeded to create a new society, with his human/animal creatures loyal only to him called Beastials (Half-humans, Half- animals). The High Evolutionary also created an elite squad of Beastials called the Knights of Wundagore (consisting of Sir Ram, Lord Tiger, Lady Ursula, and Lady Vermin) that can also use the Machine Men as law enforcers to keep the humans in order. The New York City on Counter-Earth is divided vertically with humans living on the bottom and the Beastials living miles above the street, ruling with an iron fist. The High Evolutionary's plan was simple, to turn this planet into an earthly paradise, no matter what it takes until Spider-Man and the Symbiotes led by Venom and Carnage arrived. The episode \\"Sins of the Fathers\\" revealed that the High Evolutionary is the grandfather of Karen O'Malley who he experimented on when Karen was young. The High Evolutionary was injured during the series finale in a fight against Spider-Man, a heroic Green Goblin, and The Rebellion led by Karen and John Jameson. * The High Evolutionary appears in The Super Hero Squad Show, voiced by Jonathan Frakes. In the episode \\"The Devil Dinosaur You Say!\\", Wolverine encounters the High Evolutionary on Dinosaur World. The High Evolutionary promises to help Wolverine get back to Earth if Wolverine helps him capture Devil Dinosaur in exchange. It is revealed that he plans to sell all the primitive tribes including Moon-Boy to make a profit as he comments that humanoids shouldn't co-exist with dinosaurs. Devil Dinosaur and Wolverine later storm the High Evolutionary's ship which results in the tribesmen getting free and the headquarters being destroyed, but the High Evolutionary escapes from Dinosaur World in his escape pod. * The High Evolutionary appears in Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H., voiced by Corey Burton. At some point in the future, a gamma meteor struck Earth when the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. weren't around. This caused humanity to regress back to the primitive times until the High Evolutionary was able to be their salvation by turning them into Animal Men. When the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. arrived in this time in the episode \\"Future Shock\\" thanks to Leader tricking Skaar into going into a temporal distortion wormhole, they end up attacked by some Lizard Men until the High Evolutionary arrived where he explained what happened to Earth. Afterwards, the High Evolutionary traps the Hulk in an energy cage and devolves the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. The High Evolutionary retreats with Hulk upon finding that Skaar can't be devolved. Upon some advice from Leader (who is trapped on bathroom duty after tricking Skaar), Skaar leads the devolved teammates into finding the High Evolutionary's lair. At his lair, the High Evolutionary uses his Evolution Chamber to evolve Hulk into a smarter appearance that has bat-like wings. When Skaar and the devolved teammates attack the High Evolutionary's lair, the evolved Hulk turns on the High Evolutionary stating that he would be superior to the High Evolutionary. Skaar and Hulk fought the High Evolutionary after Skaar had evolved Red Hulk in the evolution chamber. After A-Bomb and She-Hulk are evolved, the High Evolutionary devolved Hulk back to his own original state. Skaar ends up destroying the High Evolutionary's staff where its power regresses the High Evolutionary to a baby which ends up in the care of the arriving Lizard Men. The Agents of S.M.A.S.H. then return to their own time to make sure that they get back to Earth and prevent the gamma meteor from impacting Earth. They succeed in destroying the gamma meteor in the episode \\"Enter the Maestro\\" with the unlikely help of Maestro which prevents the High Evolutionary's future from happening. * The High Evolutionary appears in the Guardians of the Galaxy animated series, voiced by Nolan North. In the episode \\"Evolution Rock\\", he and his insectoid creations have captured Rocket Raccoon, Groot and Captain Marvel to experiment on and gain access to the sarcophagus artifact on Thanos's asteroid. He ended up fighting the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy. When the High Evolutionary opens the sarcophagus, he, his hybrids and his ship get sucked in. In the episode \\"Right Place, Wrong Time\\", the High Evolutionary is shown within the realm inside the sarcophagus working to get his ship to survive the freezing temperatures as a result of the sarcophagus being thrown into a cryo-volcano. In addition, the High Evolutionary has Yondu as his prisoner as he plans to experiment. Gamora and Nebula had to work together to get away from the High Evolutionary and his hybrids. In the episode \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\", the High Evolutionary is still trapped in the dark gem of Adam Warlock, having Yondu, Nebula, Titus and among others until Fin Fang Foom as prisoners. He makes a deal with Rocket Raccoon to leave Warlock if he re-evolves his family on Halfworld. After being attacked by Groot of which it happens with Warlock, its ship manages to leave its dark gem and glides to capture Warlock. The High Evolutionary was frustrated by Rocket after he detonated the High Evolutionary's ship to ensure it would fall down to Earth. Video games * The High Evolutionary appears in Marvel: Avengers Alliance. He is seen in Spec-Ops #21 where he, Mister Sinister, the Lizard and Stegron end up in a power struggle against Sauron and A.I.M. in the Savage Land. The High Evolutionary is also responsible for using Iso-8 on some dinosaurs resulting in the creation of the Iso-Saurs. Novel The High Evolutionary is one of the villains involved in the plot of the novel Avengers: Everybody Wants to Rule the World by Dan Abnett. The Evolutionary is gathering components for a massive gamma bomb with the intention of irradiating the world with a precisely-calculated mutation that will make the human race more susceptible to outside control, such as himself. He attempts to convince Bruce Banner to side with him after Banner is part of a S.H.I.E.L.D. team investigating his activities by providing a cure for the Hulk, but Banner merely feigns agreement with the plan until he can confirm what to strike to do the most damage, threatening to trigger a transformation into the Hulk unless the Evolutionary stands down and reveals the motive for mounting such an attack at this time.

They are the namesake family of the huge and little-studied superfamily Gelechioidea, and the family's taxonomy has been subject to considerable dispute. These are generally very small moths with narrow, fringed wings. The larvae of most species feed internally on various parts of their host plants, sometimes causing galls. Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga) is a host plant common to many species of the family, particularly of the genus Chionodes, which as a result is more diverse in North America than usual for Gelechioidea. By the late 20th century, over 900The Natural History Museum of London website offers details on 911 genera belonging to the family Gelechiidae. The list of these is accessible here genera with altogether more than 4,500 species were placed here, with about 650 genera known from North America alone. While these figures are certainly outdated, due to the many revisions to superfamily Gelechioidea and new descriptions of twirler moths, they still serve to show the enormous biodiversity contained in this important family. Being abundant, fecund plant-eaters, many species are agricultural pests, including: * Anarsia lineatella ‚Äì peach twig borer * Aproaerema modicella ‚Äì groundnut leafminer * Keiferia lycopersicella ‚Äì tomato pinworm * Pectinophora gossypiella ‚Äì pink bollworm * Phthorimaea operculella ‚Äì potato tuber moth, tobacco splitworm * Sitotroga cerealella ‚Äì angoumois grain moth * Tecia solanivora (Povolny, 1973) ‚Äì Guatemalan potato moth, Central American potato tuber moth * Tuta absoluta ‚Äì tomato leafminer, South American tomato moth The voracious habits of their larvae make twirler moths suitable for biological control of invasive plants. The spotted knapweed seedhead moth (Metzneria paucipunctella), for example, is used to control spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa) in North America. Taxonomy and systematics Compared to the other massively diverse Gelechioidea families ‚Äì Coleophoridae (case- bearers) and Oecophoridae (concealer moths) ‚Äì the systematics of the Gelechiidae are far less contentious. The \\"Deoclonidae\\", sometimes treated as a full gelechioid family, seem to be nothing other than a specialized offshoot from within the Gelechiidae, and are here included in the present family; some authors differ, however, and ally at least some of these genera with the Autostichinae and/or Symmocidae. On the other hand, the Schistonoeidae (scavenger moths) are preliminarily considered a distinct family here. Of the subfamilies traditionally accepted for the Gelechiidae, only three were maintained for some time pending further information; at least one other, the Physoptilinae, were suggested to also be valid. But numerous genera of twirler moths ‚Äì including most of the former \\"Deoclonidae\\" and also the proposed Physoptilinae ‚Äì were of undetermined affiliation at that moment. Later studies, including a 2013 molecular analysis of the Gelechiidae, list the following subfamilies: Subfamily Anacampsinae Bruand, 1850 Subfamily Anomologinae Meyrick, 1926 Subfamily Apatetrinae Meyrick, 1947 Subfamily Dichomeridinae Hampson, 1918 (formerly including Chelariinae, which is now placed in Anacampsinae) Subfamily Gelechiinae Stainton, 1854 Subfamily Physoptilinae Meyrick, 1914 Subfamily Thiotrichinae Karsholt, Mutanen, Lee & Kaila, 2013 Genera incertae sedis *Aerotypia Walsingham, 1911. *Antithyra Meyrick, 1906. *Coniogyra Meyrick, 1921. *Dicranucha Janse, 1954 *Metopios Lucas, 1945 *Paraschema Povoln√Ω, 1990 *Pseudosymmoca Rebel, 1903 *Sphagiocrates Meyrick, 1925 *Stenoalata Omelko in Omelko & Omelko, 1998 *Syrmadaula Meyrick, 1918 References External links Gelechiidae *Gelechioidea Global Framework * Gelechiidae Genera of the World - list of preliminary subfamily/tribe assignments * mapress * Bugguide.net.

Sfaki√° () is a mountainous area in the southwestern part of the island of Crete, in the Chania regional unit. It is considered to be one of the few places in Greece that have never been fully occupied by foreign powers. With a 2011 census population of 1,889 inhabitants living on a land area of , Sfakia is one of the largest and least densely populated municipalities on the island of Crete. The etymology of its name is disputed. According to the prevailing theory, it relates to its rugged terrain, deriving from the ancient Greek word œÉœÜŒ±Œæ, meaning land chasm or gorge.The derivation of the name of Sfakia Description The road from Chania to Sfaki√° crosses the island from north to south, through the village of Vryses. From this village the route crosses the White Mountains (Lefk√° √ìri) to H√≥ra Sfak√≠on () by the Libyan Sea. Halfway from Vrisses to H√≥ra Sfak√≠on is the fertile plateau of Askifou, surrounded by high mountain peaks. From here to H√≥ra Sfak√≠on the road is particularly spectacular. The road hugs the western slope of the Imbros Gorge offering scenic views. Another scenic route is that leading from Kapsodasos to the plateau of Kallikratis, northeast of H√≥ra Sfak√≠on. There are many beaches in Sfaki√° which do not see the numbers of tourists of the northern coast. More adventurous visitors can follow the European hiking footpath E4 which crosses Crete through Sfaki√°'s mountains. The coastal villages are not connected by a coastal road, but can be reached by ferry boats. Not far east from H√≥ra Sfak√≠on is Frangokastello, literally \\"Frankish castle\\". The Venetian fortress here was built in 1371 to deter pirates and unsuccessfully, to control Sfaki√°. It is largely ruined but is picturesquely set on a wide sandy beach with the towering White Mountains behind. Daskalogiannis was captured here in 1771. Accessible only by boat from Sfaki√° is Loutro, a small seaside village with some archaeological ruins, a few houses, small hotels and tavernas. Loutro is car-free; cars must be parked in H√≥ra Sfak√≠on or Paleoh√≥ra. In the north of Sfaki√° is the fertile plain of Askyfou. The Sfak√≠a region is crossed by many gorges, among which is the famous Samaria Gorge. All these gorges run from north to south and all end in the sea. Many of them can be walked, several even by inexperienced walkers. The region is inhabited by rare animals, like vultures and eagles, and the kri-kri (or agrimi), the wild Cretan goat. The coast of Sfaki√° is on the Libyan Sea, which is inhabited by a diminishing fish population, but occasionally dolphins, and even whales may be seen. The idea of inaccessibility and ruggedness has played a key role in how Sfakia has been represented since at least the 18th century and it is reiterated in various ways today by tourists and locals. The local speciality, \\"Sfakian Pies\\", are thin pancakes filled with mizithra cheese and served drizzled with honey. Resistance H√≥ra Sfak√≠on is famous as one of the centers of the resistance against the occupying forces of both the Venetians and the Turks. The impenetrable White Mountains to the north combined with the rocky beaches on the south helped the locals fight off all invaders. Anopolis, a village near H√≥ra Sfak√≠on, is the birthplace of one of the most celebrated Cretan revolutionaries, Daskalogiannis. A famous legend and unexplained phenomenon describes a procession of visions (Drosoulites) seen in the nearby village Frangokastello as troops that died in the war of independence against the Turks. Patrick Leigh Fermor wrote about the tall proud Sfakians and their resistance to occupation. Many tales of revolts and uprisings in Crete start in the mountains of western Crete - mountain guerillas, pallikari fighters and rebel assemblies. After the Battle of Crete during World War II, the locals helped many New Zealand and Australian soldiers escape from here on the night of May 31, 1941, suffering great reprisals. King George II of Greece had already escaped this way when the Germans invaded. Near the village of Komitades is the Church of Panagia Thymiani where the revolution of 1821 began. At the village of Loutro is the ruined \\"chancellery\\" where the first revolutionary government of 1821 met. Sfaki√° is notorious for the harshness of the environment and the warlike people. Sfakians themselves are still considered somewhat beyond the reach of the lawmakers and tax collectors of Athens, with vendettas over stolen sheep and women's honour still fought late into the 20th century, with a whole village abandoned. Stealing and banditry had been considered a way of life in the mountains, even appearing in a Creation myth, which made God Himself a Sfakiot, as recounted by Adam Hopkins: :...with an account of all the gifts God had given to other parts of Crete - olives to Ierapetra, Ayios Vasilios and Selinou; wine to Malevisi and Kissamou; cherries to Mylapotamos and Amari. But when God got to Sfakia only rocks were left. So the Sfakiots appeared before Him armed to the teeth. \\"And us Lord, how are we going to live on these rocks?\\" and the Almighty, looking at them with sympathy, replied in their own dialect (naturally): \\"Haven't you got a scrap of brains in your head? Don't you see that the lowlanders are cultivating all these riches for you?\\" The Sfakians are also famous for their hospitality and generosity towards guests, resulting in a shift from traditional labour towards tourism, with now many families running their own small hotel or restaurant. Many northern European visitors to the area in the 1970s onward who still return today stress hospitality as key element that attracted them to Sfakia. Conversing with these visitors' impressions, locals are very interested in the idea of hospitality as a form of cultural distinctiveness and morality and they often debate what it means to speak of hospitality in the age of mass tourism. History The archeology and history of Sfakia is the object of a field survey undertaken by the University of Oxford.The Archaeology of Crete, Simon R. F. Price, L. Nixon, 2002 The Sphakia Survey: Internet Edition, Simon R. F. Price, L. Nixon, J. Moody and O. Rackham, 2000 Province The province of Sfakia () was one of the provinces of the Chania Prefecture. It had the same territory as the present municipality. It was abolished in 2006.

Babers (born October 31, 1961) is an American former athlete, winner of two gold medals at the 1984 Summer Olympics, in the 400 m and the 4 √ó 400 m relay. Born in Montgomery, Alabama, Alonzo Babers was a military dependent who graduated from Kaiserslautern American High School in then-West Germany. He attended the United States Air Force Academy from 1979 to 1983, graduating with a major in aerospace engineering, where he ran track and played one season of football. The international athletics career of Alonzo Babers consisted of a spectacular rise to fame, followed by a decisive and abrupt end. Up to the end of 1982, Babers's best time in 400 m was 45.9, but he rapidly improved on that during 1983, running a best time of 45.07, but at the 1983 World Championships in Helsinki he finished in a disappointing sixth place in the 4 √ó 400 m relay. Babers continued his rapid improvement in 1984. At the USA Final Olympic Trials in Los Angeles, he won his semi-final in a personal best of 44.95. Later, in the final, he ran another personal best of 44.86 to qualify to the Olympic team. At the Los Angeles Olympic Games he further lowered his personal best to 44.75 when he won his quarter-final. In the Olympic final, Babers ran 44.27 to win the gold medal. In the 4 √ó 400 m relay, United States (Babers ran the third leg) won the gold medal easily in 2:57.91. While training for and competing in the 1984 Olympics, Babers held the rank of Lieutenant in the United States Air Force. Just one month after his double-gold performance in Los Angeles, Babers reported to flight training school and began his career as a pilot, so his athletics career was over. He was an active duty officer in the United States Air Force from 1983 to 1991 and continues to serve as a member of the Air Force Reserves. Now he is employed as a 777 pilot for United Airlines.

She received international attention at the Glyndebourne Festival, where she appeared as Zerlina in Mozart's Don Giovanni and as Adina in Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore. Freni is associated with the role of Mimi in Puccini's La boh√®me, which she sang at La Scala in Milan and the Vienna State Opera in 1963, conducted by Herbert von Karajan. She also performed the role in a film of the production and as her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City in 1965. In the earliest opera DVDs, she portrayed her characters convincingly in both acting and singing. Freni was married for many years to the Bulgarian bass Nicolai Ghiaurov, with whom she performed and recorded. Her obituary from The New York Times describes her as a \\"matchless Italian prima donna\\".  Life  Born in Modena, she had the same wet-nurse as Luciano Pavarotti, with whom she grew up and who was to become a frequent tenor partner on stage. She studied voice first with her uncle, Dante Arcelli, then with Luigi Bertazzoni and Ettore Campogalliani. She later changed her name thinking it was easier to pronounce. Freni made her operatic debut at the Teatro Municipale in her hometown on 3 March 1955 as Mica√´la in Bizet's Carmen. She later married her teacher, the pianist and director Leone Magiera; the couple had a daughter. Freni resumed her career in 1958 when she performed Mim√¨ in Puccini's La boh√®me at the Teatro Regio in Turin, and sang in De Nederlandse Opera's 1959‚Äì60 season. Her international breakthrough came at the Glyndebourne Festival, where she appeared in 1960 as Zerlina in Mozart's Don Giovanni, alongside Joan Sutherland as Donna Anna, and in 1962 as Susanna in The Marriage of Figaro, and as Adina in Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore, directed by Franco Zeffirelli. In 1961, Freni first performed at the Royal Opera House in London as Nannetta in Verdi's Falstaff. She stepped in as Nanetta at La Scala in Milan for Renata Scotto. On 31 January 1963, she appeared there as Mimi in a production staged by Franco Zeffirelli and conducted by Herbert von Karajan. She became one of the conductor 's favourite singers in operas and concerts. The production was repeated at the Vienna State Opera the same year, and she appeared at the house in eleven roles, including the title role of Puccini's Manon Lescaut, and Amelia in Verdi's Simon Boccanegra. On 29 September 1965, she first appeared at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, again as Mimi, with Gianni Raimondi as Rodolfo who also made his house debut. Reviewer Alan Rich wrote in the New York Herald Tribune: She later appeared there as Adina in Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore, Li√π in Puccini's Turandot, Marguerite in Gounod's Faust, Juliette in Rom√©o et Juliette, as Susanna, Micaela and Manon Lescaut. The following year she sang Mim√¨ again for her Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company debut, with Flaviano Lab√≤ as Rodolfo. From the early 1970s into the 1980s, Freni sang heavier Verdi roles, including Elisabetta in John Dexter's production of Don Carlos, Desdemona in Otello (alongside Jon Vickers), Amelia in Simon Boccanegra, Elvira in the Luca Ronconi staging of Ernani, Leonora in La forza del destino, and the title role of Aida performed in the Houston Grand Opera in 1987. She appeared as Puccini's Tosca only on a recording. She performed as Manon Lescaut in the Metropolitan Opera's 1990 season, and recorded Madama Butterfly and the three roles of Il trittico. Freni chose her roles carefully, saying in an interview: \\"I am generous in many ways, but not when I think it will destroy my voice. Some singers think they are gods who can do everything. But I have always been honest with myself and my possibilities.\\" She refused Karajan's offers of Leonora in Verdi's Il trovatore and the title role in Puccini's Turandot. Elvira in Ernani was set aside after a single run at La Scala (and despite offers to sing the role elsewhere). She never sang Cio-Cio-San on stage, but recorded it twice, not including the 1975 film Madama Butterfly, alongside Pl√°cido Domingo, with Karajan conducting and Jean-Pierre Ponnelle directing. She played Susanna in the Ponnelle film Le nozze di Figaro, which also featured Dietrich Fischer- Dieskau, Kiri Te Kanawa and Hermann Prey. In 1978, after her marriage to Magiera had ended in divorce, she married Nicolai Ghiaurov, one of the leading operatic basses of the post-war period. Together they helped to establish the Centro Universale del Bel Canto in Vignola, where they began giving master classes in 2002. After Ghiaurov's death in 2004, Freni continued their work of preserving the bel canto tradition, teaching young singers from around the world. Freni extended her repertoire and style during the 1990s with Italian Verismo, taking on the title roles of Francesco Cilea's Adriana Lecouvreur in Milan, Paris, Barcelona and New York, and Umberto Giordano's Fedora in London, Milan, New York, Torino, Barcelona and Z√ºrich. In 1997, she performed Giordano's Madame Sans-G√™ne at the Teatro Massimo Bellini. During this time she sang in Russian operas, such as Tchaikovsky's Tatiana in Eugene Onegin, Lisa in The Queen of Spades, and Ioanna in The Maid of Orleans. Freni ended her professional career on stage, performing teenager Ioanna at the age of 70 at the Washington National Opera on 11 April 2005. Freni died on 9 February 2020 at her home in Modena. According to her manager, she died \\"after a long degenerative illness and a series of strokes\\". On 12 February, her coffin was moved from the funeral home to the Teatro Comunale Modena for public tribute and then transferred in a procession to Modena Cathedral, where the funeral took place.  Honours  Freni was awarded the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic in the grade of Knight Grand Cross in 1990, and the French Legion of Honour in March 1993. In 1995, she was appointed Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. The University of Pisa awarded her an honorary degree in 2002 for her \\"great contribution to European culture.\\" In 2009, she was promoted to the rank of Officer in the Legion of Honour. In 2005, the Metropolitan Opera celebrated the 40th anniversary of her Met debut and her 50th anniversary on stage with a special gala concert conducted by James Levine.

They are variable in appearance, the nominal subfamily Crambinae (grass moths) taking up closely folded postures on grass stems where they are inconspicuous, while other subfamilies include brightly coloured and patterned insects which rest in wing-spread attitudes. In many classifications, the Crambidae have been treated as a subfamily of the Pyralidae or snout-moths. The principal difference is a structure in the ears called the praecinctorium, which joins two tympanic membranes in the Crambidae, and is absent from the Pyralidae. The latest review by Munroe and Solis, in Kristensen (1999), retains the Crambidae as a full family.

Beneficial crambids include the water hyacinth moth (Niphograpta albiguttalis), used to control its host (Eichhornia crassipes), the water veneer (Acentria ephemerella), a biocontrol agent used against Eurasian watermilfoil, and the bamboo borer (Omphisa fuscidentalis), of which the caterpillars are used for human consumption (see entomophagy). The mint moth (Pyrausta aurata) is an example of a harmless crambid. Crambid larvae are typically stem borers in plants of the grass family. As this family contains many important crops, some Crambidae species achieve pest status. The European corn borer Ostrinia nubilalis is perhaps the best known; introduced to the United States in the early 1900s, it is now widespread in all but the westernmost states. Other pest species include the spotted stalk borer (Chilo partellus), the Asiatic rice borer (Chilo suppressalis), sod webworms (Crambus spp.), Duponchelia fovealis, the sugarcane borer (Diatraea saccharalis), bean pod borers (Maruca spp.), the rice white stemborer (Scirpophaga innotata), the southwestern corn borer (Diatraea grandiosella), and the grape leaffolder (Desmia maculalis).

It was produced by the duo and Roy Halee. The song was later issued as the B-side of the single ‚ÄúFor Emily, Whenever I May Find Her (live version)‚Äù in 1972 to promote the release of the compilation album Simon and Garfunkel's Greatest Hits. After peaking in the charts in July 1972, the song was switched to the A-side of the single and re-entered the charts in November 1972. The song was written and composed by Paul Simon, and concerns young lovers hitchhiking their way across the United States, in search of \\"America\\", in both a literal and figurative sense. It was inspired by a 1964 road trip that Simon took with his then girlfriend Kathy Chitty. The song has been regarded as one of Simon's strongest songwriting efforts and one of the duo's best songs. A 2014 Rolling Stone reader's poll ranked it the group's fourth-best song. Background \\"America\\" was inspired by a five-day road excursion Simon undertook in September 1964 with his then girlfriend Kathy Chitty. Producer Tom Wilson had called Simon back to the United States to finalize mixes and artwork for their debut studio album, Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M. Simon, living in London at the time, was reluctant to leave Chitty, and invited her to come with him, forgetting the album and spending five days driving the country together. Several years later, \\"America\\" was among the last songs recorded for Bookends, when production assistant John Simon left Columbia Records, forcing Simon, Garfunkel, and producer Roy Halee to complete the record themselves. In 2004, Bob Dyer, a former disc jockey from Saginaw, Michigan, explained the song's genesis in an interview with The Saginaw News. According to Dyer, Simon wrote the song while visiting the town in 1966 after Dyer had booked him for Y-A-Go- Go, a concert series hosted by the Saginaw YMCA. Composition \\"America\\" is a song that \\"creates a cinematic vista that tells of the singer's search for a literal and physical America that seems to have disappeared, along with the country's beauty and ideals.\\" Art Garfunkel once described the song as \\"young lovers with their adventure and optimism\\". The song has been described as a \\"folk song with a lilting soprano saxophone in its refrain as a small pipe organ paints acoustic guitars, framed by the ghostly traces of classic American Songbook pop structures.\\" According to EMI Music Publishing's digital sheet music for the song, \\"America\\" is composed in the key of E-flat major and set in a 6/8 time signature, and has a moderately fast groove of 172 beats per minute. The duo's vocals span from the low note of B‚ô≠3 to the high note of F5. Drummer Hal Blaine, keyboardist Larry Knechtel, and bassist Joe Osborn provide additional instrumentation on the track. The lyrics do not follow any formal rhyme scheme. The song opens, on Bookends, with a crossfade from \\"Save the Life of My Child\\". (This effect is not present on the single versions, which begin with a \\"clean\\" open.) The song follows two young lovers ‚Äì \\"an apparently impromptu romantic traveling alliance\\" ‚Äì who set out \\"to look for America.\\" The song makes reference to the town of Saginaw, Michigan, with the protagonist seemingly hailing from the town, but \\"[seeking] his fortunes elsewhere\\". The narrator's companion Kathy is a reference to Chitty, linking the song autobiographically to the earlier Simon and Garfunkel hit \\"Homeward Bound\\", and to \\"Kathy's Song\\", a love song from a previous album, Sounds of Silence. The narrator spends four days hitchhiking from Saginaw to join Kathy in Pittsburgh, where together they board a Greyhound bus to continue the journey. The narrator begins with a lighthearted and optimistic outlook (\\"Let us be lovers, we'll marry our fortunes together\\") that fades over the course of the song. To pass time, he and Kathy play games and try to guess the backgrounds of their fellow passengers. Over the course of their journey, they smoke all their cigarettes. Kathy reads a magazine before falling asleep, leaving the narrator awake to reflect on the meaning of the journey alone. In the final verse, the narrator is able to speak his true emotions to Kathy, now that she is sleeping and cannot hear or answer. \\"I'm empty and aching and I don't know why\\" captures the longing and angst of the 1960s in nine simple words. The narrator then stares out the window \\"counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike\\". Many other empty, aching, and lost souls are on the highway, each on their own journey alone even if someone is traveling with them. The soaring harmony lines and crashing cymbals create a powerful and poignant end to the song's final verse: \\"They've all come to look for America.\\" Pete Fornatale interprets this lyric as a \\"metaphor to remind us all of the lost souls wandering the highways and byways of mid-sixties America, struggling to navigate the rapids of despair and hope, optimism and disillusionment.\\" Reception Stephen Holden, in reviewing Simon & Garfunkel's Greatest Hits in 1972, wrote, \\"'America'...was Simon's next major step forward. It is three and a half minutes of sheer brilliance, whose unforced narrative, alternating precise detail with sweeping observation evokes the panorama of restless, paved America and simultaneously illuminates a drama of shared loneliness on a bus trip with cosmic implications.\\" Thom Jurek of Allmusic described the song's central question as an \\"ellipsis, a cipher, an unanswerable question\\", a song in which \\"sophisticated harmonic invention is toppled by its message\\". David Nichols, in 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, called the song \\"a splendid vignette of a road trip by young lovers; both intimate and epic in scale, it traces an inner journey from naive optimism to more mature understanding.\\"Dimery, Robert (ed.) (2005). 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. Milan: Universe Publishing, p. 147. First edition, 2005. American Songwriter deemed the song \\"essentially a road-trip song, but like all road trips, it tends to reveal as much about the participants as it does about the lands being traversed.\\" Disc jockey and author Pete Fornatale describes \\"America\\" as one of Paul Simon's \\"greatest writing achievements in this phase of his career\\". In 2014, a Rolling Stone readers poll ranked it fourth among the duo's best compositions, with the magazine writing, \\"it captured America's sense of restlessness and confusion during the year that saw the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy, as well as the escalation of the war in Vietnam\\", declaring it one of their most \\"beloved\\" songs. Amy S. of ClassicRockHistory defined \\"America\\" as Simon and Garfunkel's best song. The author described the song \\"America\\" as \\"perhaps the most representative of Simon & Garfunkel's music: wistful and optimistic, personal and universal, and most of all, uniquely American.\\" Legacy The song enjoyed a resurgence in popularity ‚Äì and was introduced to a new generation ‚Äì after being featured in Cameron Crowe's critically acclaimed film Almost Famous in 2000. An early scene in the film, set in 1973, finds the free-spirited character \\"Anita\\" (Zooey Deschanel) playing the song for her mother (Frances McDormand) to \\"...explain why [she] is leaving home to become a stewardess\\". The financial services company American Express also used the song in a series of popular television advertisements in the late 2010s. In 2010, lyrics from the song began appearing spray-painted on vacant buildings and abandoned factories in the town of Saginaw, Michigan, which is mentioned in the song. The group of artists, Paint Saginaw, decided to paint the phrases after the population had dwindled vastly, noting that the song became rather \\"homesick\\" for the town's residents. The song's entire lyrics are painted on 28 buildings in the city, including railroad tracks and bridge supports. The song was featured in \\"America\\", a television advertisement for the presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders during the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries. The campaign sought permission to use it from Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel themselves, who both agreed. Garfunkel stated that he was a supporter of Sanders and his campaign, and that the usage of \\"America\\" did not take away from the song's original premise. The song appears in a 2017 TV commercial for the Volkswagen Atlas. Cover versions 1-2-3/Clouds The earliest known performances of \\"America\\" came from the band Clouds.The Illustrated History of Rock: \\"Clouds\\", by Ed Ward. \\"To Yes went the baroque structures of improvisation that were virtually rewrites of known material.\\" From sleeve notes and track, \\"America\\", BGO/EMI CD \\"Up Above Our Heads: Clouds, 1966‚Äì71\\". Released February 2012. In their earlier incarnation as 1-2-3, they had performed a re-written version of the song that included elements similar to those later used by Yes; changes in time signature, classical interludes, newly written segments, etc. A live tape exists of this being performed at the Marquee in April 1967, prior to the release of any known recording by any artist, including Paul Simon, himself. Simon had recorded demos at Levy studios in London in 1965, and tapes of these were passed to the band by a studio engineer (Stu Francis of Radio Luxembourg). In 1966, 1-2-3 also performed \\"Sounds of Silence\\" from this same tape.Sleeve notes, BGO/EMI CD \\"Up Above Our Heads: Clouds, 1966‚Äì71.\\" Released February 2012. Yes The song was rearranged by the progressive rock band Yes in 1970, performing it in concert on the first tour after Steve Howe replaced Peter Banks. Yes added elements typical to progressive rock, such as changes in time signature and long instrumental segments, while dropping the song's original repeat and fade ending. At one point bassist Chris Squire quotes \\"America\\" from West Side Story in the intro. The Yes studio version clocks in at ten and a half minutes, with live versions on the 1970‚Äì1971 tour extended to more than fifteen minutes. The studio recording first appeared in 1972 on the sampler album The New Age of Atlantic and was later included on the compilation album Yesterdays in 1975, the box set In a Word: Yes (1969‚Äì) in 2002, and on the 2003 re-issue of their album Fragile. An edited version of this recording lasting 4 minutes was released as a single and hit No. 46 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. It also reached No. 20 in New Zealand.Flavour of New Zealand, 22 January 1973 It also appeared on the Yesyears boxed set and its condensed version Yesstory, along with The Ultimate Yes: 35th Anniversary Collection. The edited version was also included as a bonus track on the 2003 re-issue of Close to the Edge, while the unedited studio version appears on Steven Wilson's 2013 remix of the same album. A live version of the song was included on 1996's Keys to Ascension as well as a performance from the final show of the 1970‚Äì1971 tour (which preceded the studio recording) on 2005's The Word Is Live.

Bowie performed seated on the floor, center stage, with a microphone and a Suzuki Omnichord. Other versions American singer- songwriter Josh Groban recorded it on his live album Live at the Greek (2003), and has performed the song live on multiple occasions, including a Howard Gilman Opera House for Brooklyn Academy of Music's celebration of Simon's music in 2008, and at the A Capitol Fourth concert in 2011. \\"Paul Simon is one of my favorite artists and 'America' has always been a song I've loved,\\" he once remarked. Lucy Wainwright Roche performs it, together with The Roches, on her 2010 album Lucy. The band America also released a recording of the song on their 2011 album Back Pages. The Swedish sister duo First Aid Kit performed the song in honor of Paul Simon at the 2012 Polar Music Prize award ceremony, which earned them a standing ovation from Paul Simon himself. On Black Friday of 2014, First Aid Kit released a 10\\" single containing the song as the title track. They performed a live version on the Marc Riley show for BBC Radio 6 Music on September 4, 2012. Sting performs the song on a quarter size acoustic guitar live on stage on the Paul Simon with Sting tour. U2 has snippeted the song on multiple occasions during their 2015 and 2017 world tours.

In many (particularly older) classifications, the grass moths (Crambidae) are included in the Pyralidae as a subfamily, making the combined group one of the largest families in the Lepidoptera. The latest review by Eugene G. Munroe and Maria Alma Solis, in Kristensen (1999) retains the Crambidae as a full family of Pyraloidea. The wingspans for small and medium-sized species are usually between 9 and 37 mm with variable morphological features. It is a diverse group, with more than 6,000 species described worldwide, and more than 600 species in America north of Mexico, comprising the third largest moth family in North America. At least 42 species have been recorded from North Dakota in the subfamilies of Pyralidae. Relationship with humans Most of these small moths are inconspicuous. Many are economically important pests, including waxworms, which are the caterpillar larvae of the greater (Galleria mellonella) and lesser (Achroia grisella) wax moths (subfamily Galleriinae). They are natively pests of beehives, but are bred indoors in enormous numbers as live food for small reptile and bird pets and similar animals. They are also used as fishing bait for trout fishing. Other notable snout moth pests relevant for their larval hosts include: * Alligatorweed stem borer (Arcola malloi: Phycitinae) - biological control of alligator weed (Alternanthera philoxeroides). * Almond moth (Cadra cautella: Phycitinae) - pest of stored cereals and dry fruit; now introduced almost worldwide. * Cacao moth, tobacco moth, warehouse moth (Ephestia elutella: Phycitinae) - pest of stored dry vegetable products; Europe, introduced to some other regions (e.g. Australia). * Dried fruit moth (Cadra calidella: Phycitinae) * Etiella behrii (Phycitinae) - pest of stored legumes; Southeast Asia and Australia * \\"Flour moths\\" - pests of stored grains, spices, flour, and similar dry vegetable products; now introduced almost worldwide. ** Indian mealmoth (Plodia interpunctella: Phycitinae) ** Mediterranean flour moth, Indian flour moth (Ephestia kuehniella: Phycitinae) * Grease moth (Aglossa pinguinalis: Pyralinae) - pest of suet and other oily food. * Lesser cornstalk borer (Elasmopalpus lignosellus: Phycitinae) - stalk pest of corn (Zea mays); tropical and subtropical Americas, introduced to the Hawaiian Islands. * Locust bean moth (Ectomyelois ceratoniae: Phycitinae) * Mahogany webworm (Macalla thyrsisalis: Epipaschiinae) - defoliator pest of mahogany trees (Swietenia); Neotropics. * Meal moth (Pyralis farinalis: Pyralinae) - pest of stored grain, flour and other cereals; now introduced almost worldwide. * Pear fruit borer (Pempelia heringii: Phycitinae) - pest of apple and pear fruits; East Asia, introduced to the Hawaiian Islands. * Pine webworm (Pococera robustella: Epipaschiinae) - defoliator pest of pines (Pinus); North America east of Great Lakes region. * Raisin moth (Cadra figulilella: Phycitinae) - pests of stored dry fruit; now introduced almost worldwide. * Rice moth (Corcyra cephalonica: Galleriinae) - pest of stored grain, flour and other cereals. * South American cactus moth (Cactoblastis cactorum: Phycitinae) - biological control of prickly pears (Opuntia). * Southern pine coneworm, \\"pitch moth\\" (Dioryctria amatella: Phycitinae) - cone and shoot pest of pines (Pinus); southern North America. * Stored nut moth (Paralipsa gularis: Galleriinae) - pest of stored nuts and drupes; Southeast Asia, introduced to Western Europe. * Sunflower moth (Homoeosoma nebulella: Phycitinae) - pest of sunflower seeds; Europe and surrounding regions. The European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) and southern cornstalk borer (Diatraea crambidoides), formerly considered snout moths, are placed in the Crambidae which, as noted above, are usually regarded as a separate family today. Systematics SEM microphoto of the head of a snout moth - note the \\"snout\\" (labial palps) extending to the upper left above the proboscis Five subfamilies are generally recognized in the Pyralidae today. The Acentropinae (= Nymphulinae), occasionally still placed here, do indeed seem to belong in the Crambidae. The snout moth subfamilies are, listed in the presumed phylogenetic sequence from the most primitive to the most advanced: * Chrysauginae (including Bradypodicolinae, Semniidae) - about 400 species occurring predominantly in the Neotropical region. Larvae typically feed on plants, but some have more unusual feeding habits. The latter include for example some myrmecophilous species, as well as a number of sloth moths which are dependent on sloths for their entire life cycle. Most Chrysauginae larvae have a sclerotised ring around seta SD1 of the metathorax. * Galleriinae (including Macrothecinae) - about 300 species worldwide. The males of galleriine moths have a gnathos almost or completely reduced, the pupae have a prominent dorsal median ridge on the thorax and abdomen, and most larvae have a sclerotised ring around seta SD1 of the first abdominal segment. * Pyralinae (including Endotrichinae, Hypotiinae) - rather diverse in the Old World; a lesser number of the roughly 900 species occurs elsewhere. The females of almost all Pyralinae except Cardamyla and Embryoglossa are recognizable by the very short ductus bursae of their genitals. * Epipaschiinae (including Pococerinae) - over 550 described species in the tropical and temperate regions (except Europe). Larvae are leaf rollers, leaf tiers, or leaf miners. Some species are minor pests of a few commercial crops. Epipaschiinae are generally hard to recognize, except in the case of adult males which have a few characteristic traits, such as the upturned and pointed third segment of the labial palps and usually a scaly projection from the antenna base. The larvae lack any stereotyped seta sclerotisations. * Phycitinae (including Anerastiinae, Peoriinae) - probably the most difficult group of Pyraloidea in terms of identification and classification. They comprise more than 600 genera and about 4000 species found all over the world. The characteristic trait of the caterpillars is a sclerotised area encircling the base of seta SD1 on the mesothorax, while the adult females have - like the males of Pyralidae in general do - a frenulum consisting of a single bristle which in turn is composed of multiple acanthae. Problematic genera In addition to those assigned to the tribes above, several genera of (presumed) Pyralidae are not firmly placed in this arrangement, but are incertae sedis. Some may be very basal lineages which stand outside the main snout moth radiations, but given the changing circumscription of the Pyralidae, some are likely to be placed outside this group in its modern meaning, either in the Crambidae or in other lineages of basal Obtectomera. Some may even belong to more ancient moth lineages, such as the Alucitoidea or Pterophoroidea. Finally, some of these (usually little-studied) genera possibly are junior synonyms of genera described earlier. These genera are in the unranked category of the family Pyralidae. The genera in question are: * Apocabimoides Neunzig & Goodson, 1992 * Ardjuna Roesler & K√ºppers, 1979 * Cabimoides Neunzig & Goodson, 1992 * Cryptophycita Roesler & K√ºppers, 1979 * Cryptozophera Roesler & K√ºppers, 1979 * Delcina Clarke, 1986 (Phycitinae?) * Eupassadena Neunzig & Goodson, 1992 * Gomezmenoria Agenjo, 1966 * Gunungodes Roesler & K√ºppers, 1981 * Indocabnia Roesler & K√ºppers, 1981 * Inverina Neunzig & Goodson, 1992 * Kasyapa Roesler & K√ºppers, 1981 * Kaurava Roesler & K√ºppers, 1981 * Kumbhakarna Roesler & K√ºppers, 1981 * Merangiria Roesler & K√ºppers, 1979 * Ohigginsia Neunzig & Goodson, 1992 * Pseudopassadena Neunzig & Goodson, 1992 * Psorozophera Roesler & K√ºppers, 1979 These genera have been placed in the Pyralidae when these were still circumscribed sensu lato and are sometimes still treated thus, but actually they seem to belong in the Crambidae (see also Micronix and Tanaobela): * Alphacrambus Bassi, 1995 * Peniculimius Schoute, 1994 * Steneromene Gaskin, 1986 * Thopeutis H√ºbner, 1818 * Yoshiyasua (formerly Melanochroa Yohiyasu, 1985 nec Roeder, 1886: preoccupied)  References  External links * Solis, M.

While serving as Member of Parliament (MP) for Eastbourne, he was assassinated by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), who exploded a bomb under his car outside his home in East Sussex. Early life Ian Gow was born at 3 Upper Harley Street, London, the son of Alexander Edward Gow, a London doctor attached to St Bartholomew's Hospital who died in 1952. Ian Gow was educated at Winchester College, where he was president of the debating society. During a period of national service from 1955 to 1958 he was commissioned in the 15th/19th Hussars and served in Northern Ireland, Germany and Malaya. He subsequently served in the territorial army until 1976, attaining the rank of Major.The Bruges Group Ian Gow - Thatcher's closest confidant After completing national service he took up a career in the law and qualified as a solicitor in 1962. He eventually became a partner in the London practice of Joynson-Hicks and Co.Obituary, The Times, 31 July 1990 He also became a Conservative Party activist. He stood for Parliament in the Coventry East constituency for the 1964 general election, but lost to Richard Crossman. He then stood for the Clapham constituency, a Labour-held London marginal seat, in the 1966 general election. An account in The Times of his candidature described him in the following terms: \\"He is a bachelor solicitor, aged 29, wearing his public school manner as prominently as his rosette. Words such as 'overpowering', 'arrogant', and 'bellicose' are used to describe him.\\"Key seats, The Times, 19 March 1966 After failing to take Clapham,UK General Election results March 1966 Political Science Resources, 13 February 2010 he continued his quest to find a seat. He eventually succeeded at Eastbourne in 1972 after the local Party de-selected its sitting member, Sir Charles Taylor. Sir Charles had represented Eastbourne since 1935 and did not take kindly to Gow.\\"More trouble for Tories at Eastbourne\\", The Times, 11 February 1972 Parliamentary career Gow entered Parliament as the member for Eastbourne in the general election of February 1974.UK General Election results February 1974 Political Science Resources, 13 February 2010 For a home in his constituency, Gow acquired a 16th-century manor house known as The Doghouse in the village of Hankham. Eastbourne was then a safe Conservative seat, and Gow always had a majority share of the vote during his time as the constituency's MP. In the general election of October 1974, he secured a 10% swing from Liberal to Conservative, doubling his majority.UK General Election results March 1966 Political Science Resources, 13 February 2010 In the 1975 Conservative leadership election, Gow voted for Margaret Thatcher in the first round ballot. Once Thatcher had forced Edward Heath out of the contest, several new candidates appeared and Gow switched his support to Geoffrey Howe in the second round, which Thatcher won. Gow was brought onto the Conservative front bench in 1978 to share the duties of opposition spokesman on Northern Ireland with Airey Neave. The two men developed a Conservative policy on Northern Ireland which favoured integration of the province with Great Britain. This approach appeared to avoid compromise with the province's nationalist minority and with the government of the Republic of Ireland. Both Neave and Gow were killed by car bomb attacks in 1979 and 1990 respectively. Irish republican paramilitaries claimed responsibility in both cases, but nobody was ever charged with causing the deaths and claims were made concerning possible involvement of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and intelligence community.A tangled web of intrigue Irish Democrat, 16 March 2006Public servant, Secret Agent by Paul Routledge, 2002 online review Through his association with Neave, Gow was introduced to the inner circles of the Conservative Party. He was appointed parliamentary private secretary to Margaret Thatcher in May 1979 at the time she became Prime Minister. While serving in this capacity between 1979 and 1983, Gow became a close friend and confidant of the Prime Minister. He was deeply involved in the workings of Thatcher's private office until his departure in June 1983.Clark, Alan. Diaries in Power. London: Phoenix, 2001. p35. Though elevated to junior ministerial office as Minister for Housing and Construction before moving later to the Treasury, Gow was known to be disappointed by his loss of influence with the Prime Minister in his new role. In late 1983 he developed plans with Alan Clark to reinvigorate Thatcher's private office by expanding it and its influence over policy, thereby creating a new role for himself, but these came to nothing.Clark, Alan. Diaries in Power. London: Phoenix, 2001. Although identified with the right-wing of the Party, he took a liberal position on some issues. He visited Rhodesia at the time of its Unilateral Declaration of Independence and was subsequently critical of the country's white minority regime. As an MP, Gow consistently voted against the restoration of the death penalty.Gow Tribute by Richard Coxwell-Rogers, Times 1 August 1990 As Minister of State for Housing and Construction (from 1983 to June 1985) he showed a willingness to commit public funds to housing projects that alarmed some on the right-wing of the Conservative party. \\"After taking what was perhaps too principled a stand in a complex dispute over Housing Improvement Grants, he was moved sideways to the post of minister of state at the Treasury\\". From 1982, Conservative policy began to move towards a more flexible position on Northern Ireland. In November 1985, Gow was persuaded by the speeches his cousin Nicholas Budgen made to resign as Minister of State in HM Treasury over the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.A Secret History of the IRA, Ed Moloney, 2002; 9PB (HB) ; p.336 Despite his disagreement with government policy, he used his resignation speech to underline his personal devotion to Thatcher, describing her as \\"the finest chief, the most resolute leader, the kindest friend that any member of this House could hope to serve.\\" Clark, Alan. Diaries in Power. London: Phoenix, 2001. p122. The Anglo-Irish Agreement would ultimately lead to devolved government for Northern Ireland, power sharing in the province and engagement with the Republic. After his resignation from the government, Gow became chairman of the parliamentary Conservative backbench committee on Northern Ireland. He was a leading opponent of any compromise with republicans and his tactics in this regard caused concern to the Northern Ireland Secretary Jim Prior and other MPs ‚Äì ‚ÄúHe [Gow] co-ordinated the Tory backbench opposition to Mr Prior's Northern Ireland Assembly bill in the early 1980s. His activities were said to have startled other Tory MPs and led to a complaint from an enraged Mr Prior to Mrs Thatcher.‚Äù The Guardian 31 July 1990, Alan Travis ‚Äì ‚ÄúUlster stance that put Gow in IRA sights‚Äù Although he was opposed to the broadcasting of Parliamentary debates, on 21 November 1989, he nevertheless delivered the first televised speech in the House of Commons. Until 1989, television cameras did not show proceedings in the House of Commons, although it had been discussed eight times between 1964 and 1989. In 1988 MPs backed an experiment with cameras in the chamber, and 1989 Commons proceedings were televised for the first time on 21 November. Technically, Gow was not the first MP to appear on camera in the chamber, as Bob Cryer, the MP for Bradford South raised a point of order before Gow presented the Loyal Address at the opening of Parliament. In his speech, Gow referred to a letter he had received from a firm of consultants who had offered to improve his personal appearance and television image, making a few self-deprecating jokes about his baldness.Enemy of TV has say, The Times, 22 November 198921 November 1989: First Commons speech on TV Democracy Live, BBC News, 31 October 2009 MPs agreed in 1990 to make the experiment permanent. In spite of his disagreement with the direction in which Government policy on Northern Ireland was moving, Gow remained on close terms with Thatcher. In November 1989, he worked in Thatcher's leadership election campaign against the stalking horse candidate, Sir Anthony Meyer. But it was reported that by the time of his death he believed Thatcher's premiership had reached a logical end and that she should retire. Gow enjoyed friendships with people of various political persuasions, including left-wing Labour MP Tony Banks.Andrew Roth and Byron Criddle's Parliamentary A-Z (1989) Alan Clark described him as \\"my closest friend by far in politics\\".Clark, Alan. Diaries in Power. London: Phoenix, 2001. p319. Personal life Gow married Jane Elizabeth Packe (born 1944) in Yorkshire on 10 September 1966. They had two sons, Charles Edward (born 1968) and James Alexander (born 1970). Assassination Although aware that he was a potential IRA assassination target, unlike most British MPs of that era, Gow refused a bodyguard, he left his telephone number and home address in the local telephone directory and in Who's Who. He never checked under his car for bombs.The Daily Mirror - 31 July 1990article New Concern About 'Soft Targets' Chicago Tribune, 7 August 1990 In the early hours of 30 July 1990, a bomb was planted under Gow's Austin Montego car, which was parked in the driveway of his house in Hankham, near Pevensey in East Sussex.Ian Gow ‚Äì A Thatcherite romantic The Guardian, 31 July 1990Daily Telegraph, 31 May 2003 Ian Gow must be spinning in his grave The Semtex bomb detonated at 08:39 as Gow reversed out of his driveway, leaving him with severe wounds to his lower body. He died ten minutes later. On hearing of Gow's death, Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock commented, \\"This is a terrible atrocity against a man whose only offence was to speak his mind.... I had great disagreement with Ian Gow and he with me, but no one can doubt his sincerity or his courage, and it is appalling that he should lose his life because of these qualities.\\"\\"Bomb kills British lawmaker who was leading foe of IRA\\", Chicago Sun-Times, 31 July 1990 In her autobiography, The Downing Street Years, Margaret Thatcher described his murder as an \\"irreplaceable loss\\".Margaret Thatcher, The Downing Street Years (HarperCollins, 1993), p. 30. The IRA claimed responsibility for killing Gow, stating that he was targeted because he was a \\"close personal associate\\" of Thatcher and because of his role in developing British policy on Northern Ireland.\\"IRA Says It Attacked Lawmaker\\" The Washington Post, 1 August 1990 Aftermath Evaluations of Gow's political career by obituarists were mixed in tone. All commented on his personal charm and his skills in public speaking and political manoeuvre. But his obituary in The Times stated, \\"It could not be said that his resignation in 1985 cut short a brilliant ministerial career\\". A tendency towards political intrigue (for example, trying to covertly undermine Jim Prior's Northern Ireland initiative after 1982) made him enemies.The Times 31 July 1990, Ian Gow obituary Nicholas Budgen commented that Gow's personal devotion to Thatcher may not have been good for Thatcher or her government. Gow's widow Jane was appointed a DBE in 1990 and thus became Dame Jane Gow. On 4 February 1994, she remarried in West SomersetMarriages England and Wales 1984‚Äì2005 findmypast.co.uk to Lt-Col. Michael Whiteley, and became known as Dame Jane Whiteley. She continues to promote the life and work of her first husband. When the Eastbourne by- election for his seat in the House of Commons was won by the Liberal Democrat David Bellotti, the Conservative MP Ann Widdecombe sent a message to voters saying \\"Bellotti is the innocent beneficiary of murder. I suspect that last night as the Liberal Democrats were toasting their success, in its hideouts the IRA were doing the same thing\\".The Guardian, 20 October 1990 In popular culture Gow was portrayed by Paul Brooke in the 2004 BBC production of The Alan Clark Diaries.

The city is small in size but densely populated, with over 407300 residents. It also houses the Egyptian Air Force Academy complex, which contains the town's largest public school in Al-Zafer. The mosque of Sadat Qureish, which is the oldest mosque in Egypt, and perhaps the entirety of Africa, is located in Belbeis.*http://www.egypttourinfo.com/belbeis.html  History  The city was important enough in the Roman province of Augustamnica Secunda to become a bishopric. The city played a role in the machinations for control of the Fatimid vizierate: first in 1164, when Shirkuh was besieged in the city by the combined forces of Shawar and crusader king Amalric I of Jerusalem for three months; then again in 1168 when the city was assaulted again by Amalric's army, who took the city after three days on 4 November and indiscriminately killed the inhabitants. This atrocity angered the Coptic Egyptians, who had seen the Crusaders as deliverers but had suffered as much as the Muslim inhabitants of Bilbeis. The Copts ended their support of the Crusaders and united with their non-Christian neighbors against the foreigners. (See Crusader invasion of Egypt.) In 1798, its fortifications were rebuilt at the order of Napoleon. Ecclesiastical history The bishopric, a suffragan of the Metropolitan of provincial capital Leontopolis, faded.

It is an open-source remake and expansion of the 1994 Chris Sawyer video game Transport Tycoon Deluxe. OpenTTD duplicates most features of Transport Tycoon Deluxe and has many additions, including a range of map sizes, support for many languages, custom (user-made) artificial intelligence (AI), downloadable customisations, ports for several widely used operating systems, and a more user-friendly interface. OpenTTD also supports local area network (LAN) and Internet multiplayer, co-operative and competitive, for up to 255 players. OpenTTD is free and open-source software licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2.0 and is under ongoing development. According to a study of the 61,154 open-source projects on SourceForge in the period between 1999 and 2005, OpenTTD ranked 8th most active open-source project to receive patches and contributions. In 2004, development moved to their own server. Since 2018, the project uses GitHub for its source repository and bug tracker. History The development of OpenTTD was driven by the desire to extend the abilities of Transport Tycoon Deluxe to support user-made additions to the graphics and gameplay. Also, users wanted to play the game on more modern operating systems and alternative computer architectures which Transport Tycoon Deluxe did not support, being released in 1994 for DOS and programmed in assembly language. Prior modifications to Transport Tycoon Deluxe There was a prior attempt to modify Transport Tycoon Deluxe to run on more modern operating systems. OpenTTD was preceded by a commercial conversion of Transport Tycoon Deluxe to run on Windows 95. It was created in 1996 by the FISH technology group, but Nola released in 1999 as part of a compilation of older Tycoon games. This release was still greatly restricted in operating systems and computer architectures it could run on. Similarly, there was an earlier success aiming to open Transport Tycoon Deluxe to modification by users. TTDPatch, initially created by Josef Drexler in 1996‚Äì97 and still being developed in 2010, changes the behaviour of Transport Tycoon Deluxe as it is running, to introduce many new features to the game, such as new graphics, vehicles, industries, etc. TTDPatch is restricted by the same operating system and computer architecture limits as Transport Tycoon Deluxe and has limited control over what features of the game can be altered. Initial development of OpenTTD In 2003, Ludvig Strigeus announced that he intended to reverse engineer Transport Tycoon Deluxe and convert the game to C. In 2004, this re-engineered Transport Tycoon Deluxe was released and named OpenTTD. This release was popular. , OpenTTD is still under active development. The early development of OpenTTD focused on restructuring the code to improve readability and extensibility. This allowed restoring features like sound and music, improving the user interface and introducing new languages for the GUI. Many new gameplay features and possibilities for user modification were also added around this time, aiming to replicate the abilities of TTDPatch. A major improvement was reprogramming multiplayer (network games) to use the internet protocol, allowing multiplayer gaming online and over modern LANs. By the late 2000s, OpenTTD was a stable and popular game and development moved toward more substantial changes. 2007 saw the development of support for custom, user-made AIs, which can provide players with more of a challenge than the original AI. Other more major changes included introducing support for IPv6, an integrated download system for user-made customisations, and support for alternative base graphics, sound and music sets in 2009. Since 2007, OpenTTD is gradually being rewritten in C++. Gameplay OpenTTD gameplay is very similar to Transport Tycoon Deluxe, on which it is based, although there are many improvements in both options within the game and ease of use. A player's aim is to build a transportation network using trucks, buses, trains, airplanes and boats to link together industries and towns on the map and transport the cargo they produce. Every time a vehicle makes a delivery of some cargo, players receive an income, allowing them to build more infrastructure (rails, stations, etc.), build more vehicles, modify the terrain, and interact with towns, via their local authorities. The default game runs from 1950 to 2050, during which a player aims to get as high a performance rating (based on number of vehicles, income, amount of cargo delivered, etc.) as possible. Chart illustrating flow of commodities between industries and towns in Temperate scenarios in OpenTTD. The world map is dotted with both industries and towns. Cargo for transportation is supplied by both industries (e.g. the coal mine which produces coal) and towns (which produce passengers and mail) and accepted by other industries and/or towns according to their needs (e.g., the power station accepts coal). Placing a station near a source and a receiver of a certain cargo allows transportation between the two. The amount of cargo supplied by a town or industry depends on the quality of transport players provide to move its goods. Payment for delivering cargo depends on the quantity of cargo delivered, how fast it was delivered and how perishable it is. Some cargoes (e.g., passengers) must be delivered faster than others (e.g., coal) to earn a good income. Block Signal\\" from the original Transport Tycoon, increases throughput of railway junction-crossing. During the course of the game, players must build and expand their transport infrastructure. The only infrastructure present on the map at the start of the game are roads within towns (as well as seas and rivers which ships can utilise). All other infrastructure‚Äîports, stations, airports, rail, canals, locks, aqueducts and depots‚Äîmust be built by players. The tools for building a rail network are particularly powerful, and players have access to many different signal types to build a complex and interconnected rail network. During the course of the game, technology improvements give players access to newer, faster and more powerful vehicles. For rail transport, new track technology also becomes available over time, first electrified rail, then monorail and maglev track. In general, newer vehicles cost more money to buy and run, and players must have earned enough money in earlier stages of the game to be able to afford to upgrade their vehicles. The full course of the default game, from 1950 to 2050, takes around 24 hours. Players can optionally start at earlier dates and play on past 2050, although no new technology becomes available. OpenTTD can be played by one player, against a computer controlled AI, or by many players against each other, over a LAN or the Internet. Multiplayer OpenTTD supports multiplayer games for up to 255 players between 15 different transport companies, and can be played both over a LAN or over the Internet. Each transport company is in competition with each other transport company, and each transport company can be controlled by more than one player at any time. This allows both co-operative and competitive multiplayer games. Competitive team games (e.g. two transport companies, both controlled by three players) are also possible. Reception OpenTTD has been praised for the number of improvements it has made to the original Transport Tycoon Deluxe, such as the AI, graphics, sounds, and ability to play multiplayer. OpenTTD received the most votes for Game of the Year for the 2004 Amiga Games Award. Lewis Denby from PC Gamer ranked OpenTTD 20th in its May 2011 list of best free PC games. Hungarian Unix Portal users chose OpenTTD as favourite (free) game in 2005, 2007, 2009, and 2010. In 2014 OpenTTD was named by PCGamer among the \\"Ten top fan remade classics you can play for free right now\\". In 2015 and 2016, Rock, Paper, Shotgun ranked OpenTTD 8th on its The 50 Best Free Games on PC list.

History  Kingdom of Yugoslavia Yugoslavia 1918‚Äì1941 Until the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, the Slovene Lands did not have a coat of arms representing the whole nation, instead it had a different coat of arms for every land. When the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs merged with Kingdom of Serbia, Slovenia had its first real coat of arms, which actually was a heavily modified one from the Serbian Kingdom. The coat of arms presents the Serbian shield with white cross on the left, the Croatian shield on the right and under both there is a blue shield representing Slovenes. An image of the royal Yugoslav coat of arms can be seen on the 10-Yugoslav dinar banknote of 1926. 10 dinar note of 1926 Socialist Republic of Slovenia The former coat of arms of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia (1945‚Äì1991) The coat of arms of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia was designed by Branko Simƒçiƒç on the basis of the symbol of the Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation. The sea and the mount Triglav motive appeared in the coat of arms of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia, one of six constituent republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The former coat of arms was rounded by wheat with linden leaves and featured a red star at the top. There was also the other coat of arms which presented Yugoslavia as a whole. Republic of Slovenia The tender for the design of the new coat of arms of Slovenia was published in May 1991. It was won by Marko Pogaƒçnik. He based his design on the understanding of Slovenia as a macroregional entity and on the work by France Pre≈°eren and Jo≈æe Pleƒçnik. In regard, to Pre≈°eren, the coat of arms depicts the description of nature given by the poet in his epic-lyric poem The Baptism on the Savica. In regard to Pleƒçnik, the coat of arms follows the coat of arms of Slovenia, carved upon the design by the architect in 1934 at the column of the Virgin Mary, which stands in front of the parish church in Bled. Pogaƒçnik's design was proclaimed the new official coat of arms of Slovenia with the constitutional amendment C 100 and became valid on 24 June 1991.

According to Pogaƒçnik, the Triglav symbolises the male principle. There are two white bending lines below it, representing the Triglav Lakes Valley and the Slovene sea and rivers in general, or the female principle. Above Triglav, there are three golden, six- pointed stars, forming a triangle and symbolising democracy. The stars are taken from the coat of arms of the Counts of Celje.

The novels present a future history of an Earth dominated by China. Setting Chung Kuo is primarily set 200 years in the future in mile-high, continent- spanning cities made of a super-plastic called 'ice'. Housing a global population of 40 billion, the cities are divided into 300 levels and success and prestige is measured by how far above the ground one lives. Some ‚Äì in the Above ‚Äì live in great comfort. Others ‚Äì in the Lowers ‚Äì live in squalor, whilst at the bottom of the pile is 'Below the Net', a place where the criminal element is exiled and left to rot. Beneath the cities lie the ruins of old Earth ‚Äì the Clay ‚Äì a lightless, stygian hell in which, astonishingly, humans still exist. These divisions are known as 'the world of levels'. In addition to the world of levels, there are the great meat-animal pens and sprawling, vast plantations to feed the population. There is also activity beyond Earth. The ruling classes ‚Äì who base their rule on the customs and fashions of imperial China ‚Äì maintain traditional palaces and courts both on Earth and in geostationary orbit. There are also Martian research bases and the outer colonies, with their mining planets. Storyline At the very heart of Chung Kuo is the 'War of Two Directions' ‚Äî a struggle for the destiny of Mankind and the clash of two different ideologies. For the planet's hereditary rulers, the T'angs, the goal is stability and security, at the expense of individual freedoms if necessary, while a commercially orientated faction desires change and the uncharted challenge of the new ‚Äî even though loosening constraints on an over-populated planet could be lethal.

For the purposes of social policy analysis & research, the City of Toronto government‚Äôs Social Development & Administration division includes Deer Park within the City of Toronto's official \\"Rosedale-Moore Park\\" and \\"Yonge-St.Clair\\" neighbourhood profiles. The neighbourhood is in Ward 22, represented by Councillor Josh Matlow at Toronto city council. The commercial area along the main streets is known simply as Yonge and St. Clair. Marked by a cluster of office buildings, the area also includes a number of restaurants, shops and services, and the St. Clair subway station, the terminus for the 512 St. Clair street car. History The name dates from 1837, when the Heath family purchased 40 acres (162,000 m¬≤) of land on the northwest corner of Yonge and St. Clair (then the Third Concession Road) and named it Deer Park. By the 1850s the neighbourhood included a racetrack, a school, and a hotel at which patrons could feed deer which roamed the Heaths' property. The Heath property was subdivided in 1846 and was entirely sold off by 1874. Deer Park in 1878. The name of the neighbourhood dates back to 1837, as the name of the Heath family property on the northwest side of St. Clair Avenue and Yonge Street. Deer Park is also home to one of Toronto's oldest cemeteries. St. Michael's Cemetery (Toronto) was opened by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toronto on September 28, 1855. There are some 29,000 graves in the cemetery. Ten acres in size, St. Michael's has the unusual characteristic of being surrounded on all sides by the backs of buildings, thus making it nearly invisible from the street. It is bound on the north by stores, apartments and office buildings along St. Clair Avenue West, on the west by houses along Foxbar Road, on the south by houses and Toronto Fire Services Station 311 along Balmoral Avenue, and on the east by stores and office buildings along Yonge Street. Entrance to the cemetery is gained through an alley off Yonge Street. The cemetery's octagonal mortuary vault was used to store bodies in the winter until the ground thawed. Designed by architect Joseph Sheard, who was also mayor of Toronto in 1871-72, the vault was designated a historic property under the Ontario Heritage Act in December 1975. In 1891 Upper Canada College moved from its urban location to the then still rural Deer Park area, establishing a large campus that remains in the same location today, interrupting Avenue Road north of St. Clair Avenue. In 1931 De La Salle College (Toronto) moved from its downtown location to an estate named 'Oaklands' originally purchased and built upon by Senator John Macdonald in 1858. Oaklands forms part of the southern boundary of Deer Park, running eastward along the escarpment from Avenue Road.Br. G.

Deer Park was annexed by the City of Toronto in 1908, and by the 1930s it had become an upper-middle class residential district, which it remains today. The intersection of Yonge and St. Clair is also the site of extensive nodal commercial development. In 1999 Robert Fulford described the current character of the neighbourhood: \\"sandwiched between Forest Hill on its western flank and Moore Park to the east, Deer Park is utterly unlike either of them‚Äîit's more commercial, a fast-changing community dominated by apartment dwellers.\\"\\"1999 real estate guide.\\" Fulford, Robert.

The historic section was originally a streetcar barn dating back to the 1880s (as a horsecar barn for the then Metropolitan Street Railway) and converted as badminton courts in 1924 when it was sold by the Toronto Transportation Commission. Education Half of Upper Canada College's main campus is located in Deer Park. The College is a private school established in 1829. In Deer Park, secular English-oriented public schools are operated by the Toronto District School Board. In the City of Toronto secular French-oriented public schools are provided by Conseil scolaire Viamonde, while publicly funded English and French Catholic schools are operated by the Toronto Catholic District School Board and Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir respectively. However, neither three school boards operate a school in Deer Park, although one was previously operated as a secondary school. The following schools are located in the Deer Park: * Deer Park Public School - A public school located at 23 Ferndale Avenue. It has been serving the community for about 125 years. The current principal is Bill Waldman and the current vice-principal is Chris Gorczynski. Deer Park has many challenging academic, sport and art programs. They include basketball, football, ultimate frisbee, Me To We club, swim team and the theatre production. Deer Park serves students from kindergarten to grade 8. * De La Salle College (Toronto) is a Roman Catholic co-educational private school established in 1851 as a boys school. Beginning in the late 1960s until June 1994, this school was previously operated as a public separate secondary school from 1987, which was a sister school to St. Joseph's College School on Wellesley Street. The school was re-privatized in 1994 and Marshall McLuhan Catholic Secondary School replaced De La Salle in 1998. * Upper Canada College Landmarks Churches * Calvin Presbyterian Church * Christ Church Deer Park * Deer Park United Church (the congregation now worships at 26 Delisle Avenue) * Yorkminster Park Baptist Church High-rise buildings * Imperial Oil Building (now known as Imperial Plaza) * Wittington Tower Residences *40 Heath Street West, at one time owned by the Anglican Church of Canada, Archbishop Desmond Tutu stayed in the house which was used for visiting Clerical dignitaries.

A cervelliere (cerveli√®re, cervelliera; , cerebrarium, cerebrerium, cerebotariumPlanch√©, loc. cit., citing Chronicon Francisi Pepina, lib. ii. cap. 50) is a hemispherical, close-fitting skull cap of steel or iron. It was worn as a helmet during the medieval period.  History  The cervelliere was first introduced during the late 12th century and was the primary head protection for Crusaders at that time. It was worn either alone or more often over or under a mail coif. Additionally, a great helm could be worn over a cervelliere, and by the late 13th century this was the usual practice. Over time, the cervelliere experienced several evolutions. Many helmets became increasingly pointed and the back of the skull cap elongated to cover the neck, thus developing into the bascinet. (Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, \\"Helmet\\") Cerveillieres were worn throughout the medieval period and even during the Renaissance.Douglas Miller, Armies of the German Peasants' War 1524-26 (Oxford: Osprey Publishing, 2003), 47.

Cheltenham is 21 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of Hornsby Shire. Cheltenham is a small residential suburb with a distinctive English atmosphere, characterised by a number of 19th Century mansions on tree-lined streets. Cheltenham shares its postcode of 2119 with Beecroft and has sometimes been viewed as part of the suburb. Most residents of Cheltenham see themselves as distinct from Beecroft, although local issues are addressed together in the Beecroft Cheltenham Civic Trust. Suburban home in Cheltenham History Cheltenham takes its name from a house built by William Chorley, a Sydney tailor and men's outfitter, who acquired the land when it was released from the Field of Mars Reserve. He named the house after his birthplace of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England. Chorley asked the government to build a station here and to name it after his property when it opened in 1898. Sutherland Road was named for John Sutherland, Minister for Public Works from 1887 to 1889.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollen, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia Beecroft Cheltenham History Group A Sam Hood photo of Mrs Surgeons Cheltenham home in 1941 The Beecroft Cheltenham History Group was founded in 1987 by local history enthusiasts to record the history of Beecroft and Cheltenham and to collect and preserve photos and other historical information relative to the area.

Transport Cheltenham railway station is on the one Northern Line of the Sydney Trains network. It is one of the few stations with no surrounding business district, due to William Chorley placing covenants on the surrounding land. The M2 Hills Motorway runs along the southern border of the suburb. For many years, Sutherland Road ran through both Beecroft and Cheltenham, and acted as a short cut between Beecroft Road and Epping Road. This road ran to the east of the Railway line and, during peak hour, was quite busy. With the opening of the M2 Hills Motorway in 1997, Sutherland Road was closed at the Devlins Creek bridge - where the M2 enters a tunnel under North Epping. The result of this closure is that the areas east of the railway line are now very quiet and the house values have benefitted.

Residents of Cheltenham often shop in Beecroft, Pennant Hills or Epping. The nearest shopping mall is in Carlingford. Ahimsa Ahimsa (an Indian word meaning non-violence) is the name of a bush retreat located in Cobran Road. It was originally the home of the environmentalist Marie Byles, who died in the house in 1979. It can be accessed at the rear of Day Road and Cobran Road (both roads are cul-de-sacs).

It took its name from the industrial suburb of Lonsdale in Adelaide, South Australia where Mitsubishi Australia had an engine production facility. The only car sold under this brand was the Lonsdale, a badge engineered Mitsubishi Sigma (GJ). It was sold as the Lonsdale YD41 and the Lonsdale YD45. The car was powered by one of three four cylinder engines of 1.6, 2.0 and 2.6 litres, producing respectively 81, 95 and 103 bhp. The largest of these power units produced a maximum torque of 192 Nm., and was one of the largest post-war four cylinder engines produced. Although the Sigma was merely an Australian version of the Mitsubishi Galant which was already available in the UK, the company's plan was to circumvent the \\"gentlemen's agreement\\", a voluntary import quota which limited Japanese-manufactured imports to 11 per cent of the market (which typically amounted to less than 200,000 cars per year). However, the idea proved unsuccessful and most of the cars imported by Lonsdale remained unsold by the time the company ceased trading. Mitsubishi continued to sell the vehicle in the UK for 1984, although rebranded as Mitsubishi Galants.

He currently serves as member of the Assembly of the Republic, member of the Council of State and President of the Socialist Party. Early life He was born at Ponta Delgada into a family with republican and democratic traditions and a history of participatory activism. His grand-uncle Manuel Augusto C√©sar was a social activist during the Portuguese First Republic, who edited the newspapers O Prolet√°rio, the weekly Federa√ß√£o Oper√°ria, the Protesto (the publication of the Centro Socialista Antero de Quental) and Protesto do Povo (another socialist publication). Career His civic knowledge, following the Carnation Revolution, was profoundly shaped by his brother Hor√°cio do Vale C√©sar (also a journalist), and many of the socialist figures of the period, including Jaime Gama, M√°rio Mesquita and Medeiros Ferreira (all students of the school Liceu Nacional Antero de Quental). He began public life in the opposition to the Estado Novo, in the last years of the regime, becoming a member of the Cooperativa Cultural Sextante, which was extinct by the National Assembly, in December 1972. In 1973, at 17 years of age, he became a member of the Comiss√£o Dinamizadora da Comiss√£o Democr√°tica Eleitoral, in Ponta Delgada. On April 26, 1974 he founded the Associa√ß√£o de Estudantes do Liceu Antero de Quental (Antero Quental Students' Association) and, a month later, the Juventude Socialista (Socialist Youth) of the Azores. He was a member of the first Secretariat elected to the Socialist Party (PS) in Ponta Delgada, and was part of the delegation from the Azores in the First National Congress of the PS, participating in the party youth-wing, the Juventude Socialista (JS). In 1975, he entered the Faculty of Law at the University of Lisbon, although he did not complete his licenciatura. During his period of studies, he also became involved in the Direc√ß√£o da Associa√ß√£o Acad√©mica da Faculdade de Direito (Directorate of the Law Faculty's Academic Association). While in Lisbon he worked as administrative coordinator in a local cooperative responsible for documentation and culture. During this time he continued as the national leader of the JS (to this day he retains a national honorary status in the organization). He was an adjunct to the Secretary of State for Public Administration during the II Constitutional Government. His political career did not slow down, when he returned to the Azores: in January 1981 he entered the Azorean Legislative Assembly at the age of 26. Shortly after, he became involved in the Direc√ß√£o do Grupo Parlamentar (Directorate of the Parliamentary Group) of the PS, as well as various parliamentary commissions, as well as presiding over the commission on Economic Affairs. Between 1983 and 1985, he was elected as Regional Legislative Assembly's Vice-President, and took on the Presidency of PS Azores. He returned to national politics between 1987 and 1989, as a representative in the Assembly of the Republic, in the Ant√≥nio Guterres government. Once again returning to the Azores, he became a member of the Municipal Assembly of Ponta Delgada, as well as the President of the Civil Parish of Faj√£ de Baixo. On 30 October 1994 (his 38th birthday) he was made the Presidente of the PS Azores, with 92% of the votes. Presidency of the Azores In 1996, he won the elections for the Regional Legislative Assembly of the Azores, by a narrow margin, winning 46% of the votes cast. The PS, under his leadership, would contest the regional legislative elections in 2000, 2004 and 2008. Although these victories brought cohesion and stability, they also brought stresses associated with internal change. Under Cesar the Political statute of the Azores was changed to limit the number of successive mandate's occupied by the president, resulting in his announcement (in 2008) not to run as his party's candidate for the 2012 elections. This was a bit of a controversy, as it was unclear at the time that Carlos C√©sar would break his own promise not run again. Vasco Cordeiro was eventually chosen as his party's successor, inline with the politics established in C√©sar's leadership. The two other candidates for the position, Jos√© Contente and S√©rgio √Åvila, were possible successors, but easily abandoned by the PS: Contente was a recognized apparatchik of the party and about the same age as C√©sar, while √Åvila was point-man in the Vice-Presidency (responsible for regional finances) and a Terceirense, which hurt his chances of succeeding on the vote-rich island of S√£o Miguel, where the PSD leader and mayor of Ponta Delgada (Berta Cabral) could easily obtain an advantage. Post-Azores Carlos C√©sar has been elected member of the Assembly of the Republic in the 2015 election, therefore returning to the Parliament where he has been between 1987 and 1991. He is one of the five personalities elected by the Assembly of the Republic to the Council of State on 18 December 2015, and he took office on 12 January 2016.

It is still in use today and is internationally famous for the large-scale opera performances given there. It is one of the best preserved ancient structures of its kind. In ancient times, the arena's capacity was nearly 30,000 people. The stage for concerts and opera performances decreases the available places to a maximum of 15,000. It will be used as the closing ceremony for the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo. Amphitheatre The building itself was built in AD 30 on a site which was then beyond the city walls. The ludi (shows and games) staged there were so famous that spectators came from many other places, often far away, to witness them. The amphitheatre could host more than 30,000 spectators in ancient times. The round fa√ßade of the building was originally composed of white and pink limestone from Valpolicella, but after a major earthquake in 1117, which almost completely destroyed the structure's outer ring, except for the so- called \\"ala\\" (wing), the stone was quarried for re-use in other buildings. Nevertheless, it impressed medieval visitors to the city, one of whom considered it to have been a labyrinth, without ingress or egress.altum lambyrintum in quo nescitur ingressus et egressus, quoted in Roberto Weiss, The Renaissance Discovery of Classical Antiquity, 1969:117 and note 7. Ciriaco d'Ancona was filled with admiration for the way it had been built and Giovanni Antonio Panteo's civic panegyric De laudibus veronae, 1483, remarked that it struck the viewer as a construction that was more than human.Weiss 1969. Opera venue Curtain call after a performance of the opera Aida by Giuseppe Verdi Scene from Georges Bizet's opera Carmen, directed by Franco Zeffirelli The first interventions to recover the arena's function as an opera venue began during the Renaissance. Some operatic performances were later mounted in the building during the 1850s, owing to its outstanding acoustics. In 1913, operatic performances in the arena commenced in earnest due to the zeal and initiative of the Italian opera tenor Giovanni Zenatello and the impresario Ottone Rovato. The first 20th-century operatic production at the arena, a staging of Giuseppe Verdi's Aida, took place on 10 August of that year, to mark the birth of Verdi 100 years before in 1813. Musical luminaries such as Puccini and Mascagni were in attendance. Since then, summer seasons of opera have been mounted continually at the arena, except in 1915‚Äì18 and 1940‚Äì45, when Europe was convulsed in war. In modern times, at least four productions (sometimes up to six) are mounted each year between June and August. During the winter months, the local opera and ballet companies perform at the Teatro Filarmonico. Modern-day travellers are advised that admission tickets to sit on the arena's stone steps are much cheaper to buy than tickets giving access to the padded chairs available on lower levels. Candles are distributed to the audience and lit after sunset around the arena. Every year over 500,000 people see productions of the popular operas in this arena.Festivals in Italy 2009 Once capable of housing 20,000 patrons per performance (now limited to 15,000 because of safety reasons), the arena has featured many of world's most notable opera singers. In the post-World War II era, they have included Giuseppe Di Stefano, Maria Callas, Tito Gobbi and Renata Tebaldi among other names. A number of conductors have appeared there, too. The official arena shop has historical recordings made by some of them available for sale. The opera productions in the Verona Arena had not used any microphones or loudspeakers until a sound reinforcement system was installed in 2011. Arena di Verona Festival Arena di Verona Festival is a summer festival of opera, inaugurated in 1913 with Giuseppe Verdi's Aida, to celebrate the centenary of the artist's birth.

She wrote extensively on the art of the period and was an editorial associate for Art News magazine.Edvard Lieber, \\"Willem de Kooning: Reflections in the Studio\\", p.10. On December 9, 1943, she married painter Willem de Kooning. Early life and education Elaine de Kooning was born Elaine Marie Catherine Fried in 1918 in Flatbush, New York. Later in life she told people she was born in 1920. Her parents were Mary Ellen O'Brien, an Irish Catholic, and Charles Frank Fried, a Protestant of Jewish descent.\\"Fried\\" surname Her father Charles was a plant manager for the Bond Bread Company. Elaine was the eldest of four children; Marjorie Luyckx, Conrad and Peter Fried were her siblings.https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/02/obituaries/elaine-de-kooning- artist-and-teacher-dies-at-68.html Her mother, despite being recalled as less loving and attentive than some parents by Elaine's younger sister, supported her eldest's artistic endeavors. Elaine's mother started taking Elaine to museums at the age of five and taught her to draw what she saw. Elaine's childhood room was decorated with painting reproductions. Mary Ellen was committed to the Creedmoor Psychiatric Center for a year during Elaine's childhood after a neighbor reported her for neglect of her children.  Studies  In grade school, Elaine began drawing and selling portraits of children attending her school. She was interested in and did well at sports as well as art. Elaine studied at Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn. After graduating from High School, she briefly attended Hunter College in New York City, where she befriended a group of abstract and Social Realist painters. In 1937, she attended the Leonardo da Vinci Art School and went on to study at the American Artists School, both in New York City. While attending school, Elaine made money working as an art school model. Marriage to Willem de Kooning In the fall of 1938 her teacher Robert Jonas introduced her to Willem de Kooning at a Manhattan cafeteria when she was 20 and he 34. Elaine had admired his artwork before meeting him. After meeting, Willem began to instruct her in drawing and painting. They painted in his loft at 143 West 21st Street, and he was known for his harsh criticism of her work, \\"sternly requiring that she draw and redraw a figure or still life and insisting on fine, accurate, clear linear definition supported by precisely modulated shading.\\" He even destroyed many of her drawings, but this \\"impelled Elaine to strive for both precision and grace in her work\\". When they married in 1943, she moved into his loft and they continued sharing studio spaces. The couple had what was later called an open marriage; they both were casual about sex and about each other's affairs. Elaine had affairs with men who helped further Willem's career, such as Harold Rosenberg, a renowned art critic; Thomas B. Hess, a writer about art and managing editor for Artnews; and Charles Egan, owner of the Charles Egan Gallery. Willem had a daughter, Lisa de Kooning, in 1956, as a result of his affair with Joan Ward. Elaine and Willem both struggled with alcoholism, which eventually led to their separation in 1957. While separated, Elaine remained in New York, struggling with poverty, and Willem moved to Long Island and dealt with depression. Despite struggling with alcoholism, they both continued painting. Although separated for nearly twenty years, they never divorced, ultimately reuniting in 1976. Career Elaine de Kooning was an accomplished landscape and portrait artist active in the Abstract Expressionist movement of the early twentieth century. She was a member of the Eighth Street Club (the Club) in New York City. The Club functioned as a space to discuss ideas. Among this group of artists were Willem de Kooning, Jimmy Rosati, Giorgio Spaventi, Milton Resnick, Pat Passlof, Earl Kerkam, Ludwig Sander, Angelo Ippolito, Franz Kline, Clyfford Still, and Hans Hofmann. A membership position for a woman was rare at that time. Elaine promoted Willem's work throughout their relationship. Along with her own work as a painter, she was committed to gaining recognition for her husband's work. Though she was very serious about her own work, she was well- aware that it was often overshadowed by her husband's fame. After showing their work in their 1951 exhibition at the Sidney Janis Gallery, Artists: Man and Wife, which also included Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner, Ben Nicholson and Barbara Hepworth, and Jean Arp and Sophie Taeuber-Arp, Elaine said, \\"It seemed like a good idea at the time, but later I came to think that it was a bit of a put-down of the women. There was something about the show that sort of attached women-wives- to the real artists\\". Despite this effect on her own career, Elaine continued to promote her husband. In 1952 she spent the summer at Art dealer Leo Castelli's house at The Hamptons with William de Kooning. In April 1954 Elaine presented her first Solo exhibition at the Stable Gallery (she sometimes declared it was in 1952 but the gallery was founded in 1953) Women were often marginalized in the Abstract Expressionist movement, functioning as objects and accessories to confirm the masculinity of their male counterparts. For that reason, she chose to sign her artworks with her initials rather than her full name, to avoid her paintings' being labeled as feminine in a traditionally masculine movement, and to not be confused with her husband Willem de Kooning. Elaine and Willem were also part of the New York School scene, which also included Jackson Pollock. Elaine de Kooning was an important writer and teacher on art. She began working at the magazine Artnews in 1948, and wrote articles about major figures in the art world. She wrote about one hundred articles to the Art News magazine. Elaine de Kooning was the first American artist in the 1950s to take a role of the artists critic. \\"As an writer, she wrote about culture, art, and new ideas to her generation of artists and readers.\\" Although Elaine was a successful writer, she considered herself a \\"painter by nature.\\" Elaine de kooning's art and writing were all devoted to art and humanity. Over the course of her life, she held teaching posts at many institutions of higher education. In 1957, after Elaine and Willem de Kooning separated, she took on a series of short-term teaching jobs to support herself. She taught at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque; the University of California in Davis; at Carnegie Mellon, at Southampton College on Long Island; at the Cooper Union and Pratt Institute in New York; at Yale; at RISD in Rhode Island; Bard College; the University of Georgia and the New York Studio School in Paris. Between 1976 and 1978, she served as the first Lamar Dodd Visiting Professor of Art at the University of Georgia (UGA) in Athens. In 1985 she was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full academician in 1988. In 2016 de Kooning was one of twelve female artists featured in the \\"Women of Abstract Expressionism\\" exhibition organized by the Denver Art Museum. The purpose of this show was to highlight the unique talents and perspectives of female artists who, as was previously noted, were often dismissed or overshadowed by their male counterparts. The show later traveled to the Mint Museum and the Palm Springs Art Museum. \\"For Elaine, everything was always new, never resolved, always being unmade and made, as if it had never been made before. She did not accumulate experience and learn what to expect ... Life was a constant surprise.\\" Being the wife of the famous painter Willem de Kooning, she did not receive real recognition for her own achievement until a few years before she died. Her works are in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, The Metropolitan Museum Of Art, and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York. Art Elaine de Kooning made both abstract and figurative paintings and drawings of still life, cityscapes, and portraits. Her work was influenced by the artists Willem de Kooning and Arshile Gorky, artists who worked abstractly and also in a figurative way. Her earlier work comprised watercolors and still lifes, including fifty watercolor sketches inspired by a statue in the Luxembourg Gardens in Paris. Later in her career, her work fused abstraction with mythology, primitive imagery, and realism. Her gestural style of portraiture is often noted, although her work was mostly figurative and representational, and rarely purely abstract. She produced a diverse body of work over the course of her lifetime, including sculpture, etchings, and work inspired by cave drawings, all in addition to her many paintings. Her work presents a combination between painting and drawing, surface and contour, stroke and line, color and light, transparency and opacity. When asked about her style she said, \\"I'm more interested in character than style. Character comes out of the work. Style is applied or imposed on the work. Style can be a prison.  Early works  In the summer of 1948, Elaine and Willem de Kooning spent a summer at Black Mountain College near Asheville, North Carolina. Elaine studied under Josef Albers, R. Buckminster Fuller and Merce Cunningham. A regular participant in theatrical performances, Elaine was very involved in the college's social life. While there, she created a body of work of sixteen abstract painting with colorful interlocking curves. Although the work were helpful in her progress as an artist, she found her series at proved to be a dead end and kept them stored away for decades.  Portraits  A large portion of Elaine de Kooning's work was in portraiture. In addition to painting many self-portraits throughout the course of her life, her subjects were often fellow artists‚Äîusually men‚Äîincluding poets Frank O'Hara, John Ashbery, and Allen Ginsberg; writer Donald Barthelme; art critic Harold Rosenberg; Thomas B. Hess, managing editor of Artnews; choreographer Merce Cunningham; legendary art dealer Leo Castelli; innovative jazz musician Ornette Coleman; the famous Brazilian soccer star Pele; and painters Fairfield Porter, Alex Katz and her husband, Willem de Kooning. Although she worked in a gestural Abstract Expressionist mode, she never abandoned working with the figure ensuring the person's likeness. Elaine employed a wide range of virtuosic drawing and painting techniques: finely detailed pencil drawings and more free ink drawings, crosshatching, erasure, stumping, and improvisational graphic lines, thin paint and impasto, ‚Äúthin, dripping washes of bold color‚Ä¶‚Äù with many media: pencil, ink, charcoal, gouache, collage, mixed media, oil on paper, canvas and masonite. 'She achieves a sense of distinguishing facial features and captures each subject's presence with sharp, jagged strokes of paint‚Ä¶ A drawing of [her brother] Conrad from 1951 presents [his] head and shoulders against a dark background, with a combination of careful lines and darker strokes defining a contemplative figure with great subtlety.‚Äù In regard to her portraiture, Elaine de Kooning wrote, \\"when I painted my seated men, I saw them as gyroscopes. Portraiture always fascinated me because I love the particular gesture of a particular expression or stance ... Working on the figure, I wanted paint to sweep through as feelings sweep through...\\" She studied each person \\"to find the characteristic pose that would define them.\\" Elaine de Kooning made portraits of men in her life, such as her husband Willem de Kooning and gallery owner Charles Egan, with whom she had an affair while he was representing her husband Willem de Kooning. A great example of this is the series of studies and finished portraits of President John F. Kennedy, which was the most important commission in her career. De Kooning also did a series of men with children, and a series of women after she resumed painting a year after John F. Kennedy's death.  New Mexico  In the fall of 1958, until late spring of 1959 Elaine got a teaching appointment as visiting Professor at the University of New Mexico. This gave her the opportunity to immerse herself in the characteristic color and space of the Southwestern landscape. She visited Juarez, Mexico where she attended many bullfights. She created a series of painting inspired by the theme with bold and bright colors. She wrote that \\"the cottonwood trees and aspens had turned an overwhelming gold\\" and that \\"New England mountains are so well planted, but the New Mexico mountains seems to move toward you\\". During her stay she travelled to Sante Fe and visited Georgia O Keeffe. She described her as a \\"grand old gal\\" who \\"looks like a monk and was very witty in a dry sort of way\\". She started to experiment with acrylic paint during that period. She made connections with students such as William Conger and became friends with artists Joan Oppenheimer, Connie Fox or Margaret Randall. She also got involved with Robert Mallary a fellow instructor.  Bacchus series  During the 1970s, she made a series of quasi-figurative, orgiastic paintings titled Bacchus. This series of paintings and watercolors that Elaine de Kooning generated over seven years began in 1976. She was captivated by a 19th-century sculpture of the Roman god Bacchus, which she saw in the Luxembourg Gardens in Paris. She particularly admired the sculpture‚Äôs twisting, dynamic form, which portrays the commotion created by the drunken god and his equally inebriated attendants. It was the first time she ever used acrylic paint.  Later works  In 1983 Elaine visited the paleolithic cave paintings of Lascaux in France and Altamira in Spain and produced a series of paintings titled Cave Walls. In Paleolithic art she found the roots of Abstract Expressionism, since they have the same improvisational processes and spontaneous technique. In other words, \\"she found Paleolithic art close in spirit to twentieth-century art.\\" In 1985 when Elaine de Kooning visited the cave in the Spanish Pyrenees, she realized that the geological formations and textures of the cave wall were the same as her ground of flying color, drips, washes, and strokes, animal forms and drawing rising out of its contours; giving her the affirmation to her own way of working. These series of paintings were shown at the Fischbach Gallery in November 1988, three months before her death. Exhibitions De Kooning's work has been featured in numerous solo exhibitions as well as in a multitude of group shows in commercial art galleries as well as in major art museums and institutions. The artist's work has received increasing critical acclaim posthumously, resulting in exhibitions such as the major museum show \\"Elaine De Kooning: Portraits\\" hosted by the National Portrait Gallery in 2015 in Washington, DC. =Selected solo exhibitions= *1954, 1956: Stable Gallery, New York; *1957: Tibor de Nagy Gallery, New York; *1958: Museum of New Mexico Art Gallery, [Santa Fe, New Mexico]; *1959: Lyman Allyn Art Museum, New London, Connecticut; *1960: Ellison Gallery, Fort Worth, Texas; *1960, 1963, 1965, 1975: Graham Gallery, New York; *1964: \\"25 Portraits of J.F.K.\\", Peale House Gallery, Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; *1973 Montclair Art Museum, New Jersey *1979: \\"Bacchus, Works on Paper\\", Lauren Rogers Museum of Art and Library, Laurel, Mississippi; *1982: 86: Gruenebaum Gallery' New York; *1983: \\"Elaine de Kooning and the Bacchus Motif\\", Arts Club of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois; *1984: \\"Elaine de Kooning: New Paintings\\", C.

The Smithsonian Institution's National Portrait Gallery reportedly holds the largest museum collection of portraits by De Kooning. Death De Kooning died on February 1, 1989, in Southampton, New York, a year after having a lung removed due to lung cancer. Legacy Mary Beth Edelson's Some Living American Women Artists / Last Supper (1972) appropriated Leonardo da Vinci‚Äôs The Last Supper, with the heads of notable women artists collaged over the heads of Christ and his apostles. Elaine was among those notable women artists. This image, addressing the role of religious and art historical iconography in the subordination of women, became \\"one of the most iconic images of the feminist art movement.\\" In 2015, the Pollock-Krasner House and Study Center hosted \\"Elaine de Kooning Portrayed,\\" an exhibition dedicated to portraits, likenesses, and reflections on de Kooning by other artists, including her husband Willem as well as Arshile Gorky, Fairfield Porter, Hedda Sterne, Alex Katz, Robert De Niro, Sr., Ray Johnson, Joop Sanders, Paul Harris, and Edvins Strautman. One of the few residences owned by Elaine de Kooning during her lifetime was a studio at Alewive Brook Road in East Hampton. The current owners are reportedly developing an artists' residency/alternative exhibition space referred to as \\"the Elaine de Kooning house.\\" See also * Women in art * American Figurative Expressionism * New York Figurative Expressionism * New York School References Sources *Gabriel, Mary.

It was created in the first half of the 14th century for the eldest son of Robert of France, Count of Clermont and Beatrice of Burgundy, heiress of the lordship of Bourbon. In 1416, with the death of John of Valois, the Dukes of Bourbon were simultaneously Dukes of Auvergne. Although the senior line came to an end in 1527, the cadet branch of La Marche-Vendome would later succeed to the French throne as the Royal House of Bourbon, which would later spread out to other kingdoms and duchies in Europe. After this date, the title was given to several Princes of Cond√© and sons of the French Royal family. Dukes of Bourbon Arms of the dukes from 1410 to 1488 Arms of the dukes from 1488 to 1523 Peerage # 1327‚Äì1342 : Louis I, Duke of Bourbon, the lame or the great, father of # 1342‚Äì1356 : Peter I, Duke of Bourbon, father of # 1356‚Äì1410 : Louis II, Duke of Bourbon, father of # 1410‚Äì1434 : John I, Duke of Bourbon, father of # 1434‚Äì1456 : Charles I, Duke of Bourbon, father of # 1456‚Äì1488 : John II, Duke of Bourbon, brother of # 1488‚Äì1488 : Charles II, Duke of Bourbon, Cardinal and Archbishop of Lyons, brother of # 1488‚Äì1503 : Peter II, Duke of Bourbon, father of # 1503‚Äì1521 : Suzanne, Duchess of Bourbon, wife of # 1505‚Äì1523 : Charles III, Duke of Bourbon, Count of Montpensier and Dauphin of Auvergne For most of their history, the dukes of Bourbon were closely allied to their royal Valois cousins. This allowed them to maintain their rank with comparable prestige. They fought against the English in the Hundred Years' War, and took the side of the Armagnac faction during the Armagnac‚ÄìBurgundian Civil War. Peter II and his wife, Anne, daughter of Louis XI, had only one surviving child, Suzanne. They made her their heir through a concession from Louis XII. Anne, knowing that the Bourbon-Montpensier branch, the next senior branch of the Bourbon family, would pursue their claim, married her daughter to Charles, Count of Montpensier. Their marriage thus consolidated the vast possessions of the Bourbon family. The project, however, failed. Suzanne died childless, and the new king's mother, Louise of Savoy, claimed her inheritance, as heir by proximity of blood. Louise offered to marry the duke of Bourbon to settle the matter amicably. But Louise of Savoy was already 45 years old, so the duke refused her, with insulting language. The king sided with his mother, driving the duke into a conspiracy with the Emperor and the King of England. Once discovered, he was stripped of his titles and possessions in 1523. With his death in 1527, the line of Bourbon- Montpensier became extinct in the male line. The next senior line, of Bourbon- Vend√¥me, was not allowed to inherit the forfeited lands. Therefore, the heir male of the Bourbon family belonged to the House of Bourbon-Vend√¥me from 1527 onwards, in the person of Charles de Bourbon, Duke of Vend√¥me until he died in 1537. Charles remained loyal to the king, even though Francis I had denied him the Bourbon inheritance and the inheritance of his wife, the sister of Charles IV, Duke of Alen√ßon. Charles's son, Antoine, became king of Navarre, and his grandson, Henry IV, became king of France. All of the present-day family members descend from him. As the new reigning dynasty, the House of Bourbon- Vend√¥me was simply called the House of Bourbon.  After 1523: personal title  The title was vacant from 1523 to 1544. In 1523, Louise of Savoy, mother of King Francis I of France, challenged the succession to the estate of Suzanne, Duchess of Bourbon, who died childless. She claimed the succession as the heir by proximity of blood, as a descendant of the House of Bourbon through her mother. Seeing no hope of prevailing against the king's mother, the Constable of Bourbon went into the service of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1531, the duchy merged into the royal domain for the first time. *1544‚Äì1545: Charles, Duke of Orleans, youngest son of Francis I of France. He died childless, and the title returned to the crown. *1566‚Äì1574: Henry, Duke of Anjou, younger brother of Charles IX of France. He succeeded to the throne in 1574, and his titles merged into the crown. The title of Duke of Bourbon was granted in 1661 to Louis, Grand Cond√©. Most of his descendants preferred to use their ancient courtesy title, Prince of Cond√©. The title of Duke of Bourbon thereby became a courtesy title for some descendants of the Prince of Cond√©. *1661‚Äì1667: Louis, Grand Cond√© *1667‚Äì1670: Henri de Bourbon, grandson of preceding, died in infancy *1670‚Äì1709: Louis, Prince of Cond√©, brother of preceding *1709‚Äì1736: Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon, son of preceding *1736‚Äì1772: Louis Joseph, Prince of Cond√©, son of preceding *1756‚Äì1830: Louis Henri, Prince of Cond√©, son of preceding.

During his first joust, in 1279, Robert suffered head injuries which rendered him an invalid for the remainder of his life. Robert is considered the founder of the House of Bourbon, a family which, with the passing of centuries came to reign as kings of Navarre (1572-1830), kings of France (1589-1848; due to the extinction of all legitimate agnatic progeny of all his elder brothers), kings of Spain (1700-present), kings of the Two Sicilies (1735-1860), dukes of Parma (1748-1796 and 1847-1859) and grand dukes of Luxembourg (1964-present).

It is the last major settlement on State Highway 1. Ahipara Bay, the southern end of Ninety Mile Beach, is 5 km west. The main industries are forestry and tourism. The population is 5,871 (2018 census), which makes it second-largest town in the Far North District, after Kerikeri. The name Kaitaia means ample food, kai being the MƒÅori word for food. The Muriwhenua are a group of six northern MƒÅori iwi occupying the northernmost part of the North Island surrounding Kaitaia. History and culture European settlement The Kaitaia Mission Station was established between 1833 and 1834 after a series of visits by Church Missionary Society (CMS) representatives including Samuel Marsden, and at different times, Joseph Matthews and William Gilbert Puckey. Puckey and Matthews had married two sisters, Matilda and Mary Ann Davis respectively, (daughters of Richard Davis, a lay missioner based at Waimate). They formed a tight band, initially living together in raupo huts, and then in houses they built. As Puckey and the sisters were fluent in Maori, (Puckey having arrived in New Zealand in 1819 with his father, William Puckey, and the Davis family in 1823), they spoke Maori when together, to help Joseph pick up the language. Both families grew and intermarried, forming the basis of the early Pakeha settler community. At one point, the Church Missionary Society decided that either Puckey or Matthews should move to a new location to the south to facilitate the spread of the word, but N≈çpera Panakareao wrote a heartfelt letter to the CMS committee, pleading not to take away 'one of the two candlesticks'. In February 1841, about 500 Maori were present at a CMS service. In 1852 arguments developed between one chief and his tribe, however the impact of the missionaries meant that the old ways of settling disputes had passed. Richard Matthews, the brother of Rev. Joseph Matthews, arrived in the Bay of Islands in December 1835 and for a time, joined his brother in Kaitaia. Richard Matthews had been a lay missionary on the second voyage of HMS Beagle with Charles Darwin.Darwin, Charles. Journal of a Voyage Round the World, 1831-36 Richard Matthews served the CMS as a lay catechist at Kaitaia. In 1838 he married Johanna Blomfield, the sister of Mrs Martha Blomfield Clarke, whose husband George was a CMS missionary at Te Waimate mission. In 1840 Richard and Johanna Matthews helped set up a missionary station at Whanganui. There were plans to extend the Okaihau Branch railway to Kaitaia and construction was started in the 1920s, but with the line nearly complete to Rangiahua, a review in 1936 determined that the line would not be viable and construction was abandoned. The line terminated in Okaihau until it was closed on 1 November 1987. D 221, a steam tank locomotive, has been on static display at Centennial Park since 1967.

Life Louis was born in Clermont-en-Beauvaisis, the son of Robert, Count of Clermont, and a grandson of King Louis IX of France. Louis' mother was Beatrix of Burgundy, heiress of Bourbon and a granddaughter of Hugh IV, Duke of Burgundy. He fought on the losing side in the Battle of the Golden Spurs (1302) and in the Battle of Mons-en-P√©v√®le (1304), but managed to escape unharmed. In 1310, he was made Grand Chambrier of France. In 1327, Charles IV of France persuaded him to exchange the County of Clermont for that of La Marche, and elevated Bourbon to a duchy-peerage. However, Clermont was restored to him by Philip VI of France in 1331. He belonged to Philip VI's small circle of trusted advisors. Duke Louis is reported to have been somewhat mentally unstable, in particular suffering from nervous breakdowns. The trait is believed to have been hereditary, with his granddaughter Joanna of Bourbon, her son, King Charles VI of France, and Charles' grandson, King Henry VI of England, all displaying similar symptoms. He was buried in the now-demolished church of the Couvent des Jacobins in Paris. Family and children In 1310, Louis married Mary of Avesnes, daughter of John II of Avesnes, Count of Hainaut and Holland by Philippa of Luxembourg. They had eight children: # Peter I, Duke of Bourbon (1311-1356), married Isabella of Valois, had issue.

Peter was son of Louis I of Bourbon, whom he also succeeded as Grand Chamberlain of France, and Mary of Avesnes. Duke Peter is reported to have been somewhat mentally unstable, a trait of nervous breakdowns (presumably hereditary) that showed clearly for example in his daughter Joan of Bourbon, the queen, and in her son, king Charles VI of France, as well as in Peter's only surviving son, Duke Louis II. Early career Peter I took part in several of the early campaigns of the Hundred Years War which broke out in 1337. In the summer of 1339 he took part in Jean de Marigny, Bishop of Beauvais's failed attack on Bordeaux. In autumn 1341 he took part in the John, Duke of Normandy's campaign in Brittany. He was present at the coronation of Pope Clement VI at Avignon 19 May 1342. Summer 1342 he was together with the Raoul I of Brienne, Count of Eu given command of the covering force protecting France from attacks from the north while king Philip VI campaigned in Brittany. In August 1343 he and the Dauphin of Viennois were the French ambassadors at a peace conference at Avignon, but the negotiations were fruitless as Edward III of England declined to send any but the most junior members of the embassy. Lieutenant in Languedoc A portrait of Peter from a 15th century Armorial d'Auvergne On 8 August 1345 Peter I was appointed by Philip VI as his lieutenant on the south-west march. His opponent was to be Henry, Earl of Derby (later Earl and Duke of Lancaster) who completed disembarking his army at Bordeaux the day after Peter I's appointment. Peter I arrived to take up his lieutenancy in Languedoc in September. By then the Earl of Derby had already opened his campaign, throwing the French defences into disarray with the capture of Bergerac and the destruction of the French army present there the previous month. Bourbon set up headquarters at Angoul√™me and begun an extensive recruitment campaign to raise a new army, command of which fell to the Duke of Normandy. However on 21 October the Earl of Derby won another crushing victory outside Auberoche over parts of this force. The Duke of Normandy abandoned his campaign once he heard the news. In early November he disbanded his army and left for the north. The Earl of Derby exploited the absence of a French commander in the field to lay siege to the important fortress-city of La R√©ole. Bourbon proclaimed the arri√®re-ban in Languedoc and the march provinces in an attempt to find troops to relieve the siege. However the results were poor as many of the potential recruits were still on their way home from the army just disbanded by John of Normandy. Attempts by John I, Count of Armagnac to raise troops from his domains in the Rouergue also produced little. Early January 1346 the garrison of La R√©ole marched away under truce. Winter 1346 Bourbon kept his winter quarters at the provincial capital of Agen, a city which quickly was becoming isolated as many of the lesser towns were captured or defected to the English. Spring however opened with the so far greatest French effort in the south-west. Bourbon and the Bishop of Beauvais raised a new army at Toulouse, in part financed by the Pope whose nephew had been captured by Derby the previous year, while John of Normandy brought with him a substantial number of nobles from the north including such dignitaries as the Eudes IV, Duke of Burgundy, Raoul II of Brienne, Count of Eu the Constable of France, both Marshals and the Master of Crossbowmen. In April Normandy laid siege to the town of Aiguillon which controlled the confluence between the Lot and the Garonne. There they still remained in August when John of Normandy was urgently recalled to the north to help stop Edward III who had landed in Normandy. And so the French 1346 campaign in the south ended having accomplished nothing. Diplomatic missions In July 1347 he took part in fruitless negotiations with the English outside Calais in the days just before that city's capitulation. On 8 February 1354 he was together with the Guy, Cardinal of Boulogne appointed as King John II's commissioners to King Charles II of Navarre, empowered to offer whatever Charles wanted. The two met the King of Navarre in the castle of Mantes, accompanied by the two dowager Queens and droves of courtiers and ministers, most of who more or less openly sympathized with Charles of Navarre. The treaty concluded 22 February granted to Charles of Navarre a considerable part of Lower Normandy which he was to hold with the same rights as the Duke of Normandy. In January 1355 he was sent together with the Chancellor of France Pierre de la For√™t on a diplomatic mission to Avignon where they were to meet with an English embassy led by Henry of Lancaster and Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel. The purpose of the mission was to formally ratify a peace treaty based on a draft drawn up at Gu√Ænes the previous year. However since then French policy had changed, the French ambassadors had only come to reject the English demands and had nothing new to offer. Negotiations therefore quickly broke down and the conference ended having accomplished nothing except prolonging the existing truce a few more months until 24 June. May 1355 when it became apparent that open war was about to break out between the King of France and a King of Navarre allied to England the Duke of Bourbon belonged to the party fronted by the Dowager Queens who lobbied John II on Charles of Navarre's behalf. In the end John II gave way and on 31 May agreed to pardon Charles of Navarre. In July the Duke of Bourbon and the Chancellor met with English ambassadors to negotiate the extension of the truce. As both the French and English governments had decided to resume the war these negotiations were naturally quite empty and fruitless. Peter was killed in the Battle of Poitiers 19 September 1356 and buried in the now-demolished church of the Couvent des Jacobins in Paris. Marriage and issue On 25 January 1336 he married Isabella of Valois, daughter of Charles, Count of Valois and his third wife Mahaut of Ch√¢tillon. Peter and Isabella had: *Louis II (1337-1410) *Joanna (1338-1378), married King Charles V of France *Blanche (1339-1361, Medina-Sidonia), married King Pedro of Castile in 1353 in Valladolid, poisoned by her husband *Bonne (1341 - 19 January 1402, Ch√¢teau de M√¢con), married Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy in 1355 in Paris *Catherine (1342-1427, Paris), married John VI of Harcourt *Margaret (1344-1416), married Arnaud Amanieu, Viscount of Tartas *Isabelle (b. 1345) *Marie (1347-1401, Poissy), Prioress of Poissy References Sources  Further reading *Sumption, Jonathan, The Hundred Years War I: Trial by Battle, University of Pennsylvania Press, September 1999, *Sumption, Jonathan, The Hundred Years War II: Trial by Fire, University of Pennsylvania Press, October 2001, Dukes of Bourbon House of Bourbon (France) Counts of La Marche Counts of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis French military personnel killed in action 1311 births 1356 deaths 14th-century peers of France People of the Hundred Years' War ","title":"Peter I, Duke of Bourbon"},{"id":"703396","text":"Bournemouth University is a public university in Bournemouth, Dorset, England, with its main campus situated in neighbouring Poole. The university was founded in 1992; however, the origins of its predecessor date back to the early 1900s. The university currently has over 16,000 students, including over 3,000 international students. The university is recognised for its work in the media industries. Graduates from the university have worked on a number of Hollywood films, including Gravity, which was awarded the Achievement in Visual Effects Oscar at the 86th Academy Awards in 2015. In 2017 Bournemouth University received a silver rating in the Teaching Excellence Framework, a government assessment of the quality of undergraduate teaching in universities and other higher education providers in England. > Our purpose at BU is to inspire learning, advance knowledge and enrich > society.

History   Predecessor institutions  The university was first founded in the early 20th century as the predecessor Bournemouth Municipal College. The college initially offered courses to prepare students for University of London degrees (1942-1976). In the mid 1960s there were 6,850 day and evening students.Hansard, HC Deb 01 July 1965 As early as 1965, in the House of Commons, the number of students at the college was highlighted, and the Secretary of State was asked to consider a university application. At the time the Government did not intend to create any new universities until the late 1970s,. In the 1970s the college became the Bournemouth College of Technology. Later that decade, following a review by the Dorset Education Committee, the College of Technology changed to become Dorset Institute of Higher Education (DIHE). Bernard MacManus was appointed Director in 1983 and presided over a significant expansion in curriculum and student numbers, against a backdrop of initial uncertainty over the Weymouth Campus. During this time the Talbot Campus was consolidated having been established in 1976. The neighbouring Student Village was also constructed. A second campus was established at Lansdowne. The period between 1983 and 1994 saw the Institute expand into new disciplines including heritage, tourism, tax, public relations, computer animation and information systems. Two foundation stones remain within university buildings. The foundation stone for the College of Technology (1970s) resides in the main lobby of Poole House, Talbot Campus. The foundation stone for the Dorset Institute is mounted in Dorset House near what is now called The Edge. Bernard MacManus was honoured by Bournemouth University with an honorary doctorate in 2007.  University status  The expansion under Dr MacManus allowed the institute to make a strong case to become a polytechnic, which was gained in 1990. In 1992 all polytechnics were awarded university status and the institute was renamed to become Bournemouth University. By September 1994, over 9,000 students had been recruited nationally, and internationally, to undergraduate and postgraduate degrees. By 1996 the university had 11 endowed professorial posts, including:https://web.archive.org/web/19961030154916/http://www.bournemouth.ac.uk/general/Professorial- Posts.html * Royal Mail Chair in Business Performance Improvement * Intel Chair in Computer Supported Cooperation * British Property Federation Chair in Archaeology and Development * IBM Chair in Concurrent Engineering * Intergraph Chair in Electronic Design Automation * GPT Chair in Software Engineering * Steele Raymond Chair in Business Law * Hewlett Packard Chair in Computer Animation * Sutcliffe Chair in Catering Management * Marks & Spencer Chair in Retail Management In recent years the university has announced a significant investment programme, and by 2018 it plans to invest ¬£200 million in new buildings and facilities including a new Student Centre, which opened in March 2015.

The Talbots, the heraldic beasts on the shield, represent the location of the main campus. The crowns denote the three Saxon crowns of the Kingdom of Wessex, and the nearby boroughs. The blue represents the nearby sea, reflecting the location of the university, on the Jurassic Coast of Dorset. The red dragon in the Coat of Arms represents Dorset, and the scroll represents learning. The Latin motto Discere Mutari Est means To Learn is to Change.  Campuses  Main entrance on the Talbot Campus Bournemouth University has two campuses: Talbot Campus and Lansdowne Campus.  Talbot Campus  The Talbot Campus is situated at Fern Barrow on the Poole side of the boundary with Bournemouth. It is where the main University buildings are located, including the students' union and the main library. The campus also contains cafes and refectories, Dylan's and The ground up bars, a doctors' surgery, shops, Star Bucks, Costa and a branch of Santander. In 2017-2018, improvements and new constructions were completed.  Lansdowne Campus  The Lansdowne Campus is just outside Bournemouth's town centre, housing six teaching and administrative buildings, the students' union nightclub and various halls of residence located around Christchurch Road, Oxford Road and Holdenhurst Road. A new Bournemouth University International College is currently being built at the campus. Unlike Talbot, Lansdowne is not a self-contained campus.  Organisation and governance  Bournemouth University is currently divided into the following faculties: *The Faculty of Science and Technology (Archaeology, Anthropology, Biology, Geography, Design, Engineering, Computing and Informatics, Forensic Sciences, and Psychology) - home to the Festival of Design & Innovation *The Faculty of Media and Communication ‚Äì home to the Centre for Intellectual Property Policy & Management (CIPPM), the Centre for Excellence in Media Practice, the National Centre for Computer Animation and the Centre for Broadcasting History Research *The Faculty of Health and Social Sciences *The Bournemouth University Business School ‚Äì home to the International Centre for Tourism & Hospitality Research Academics  Awards  In 2011 the university was awarded the Queen's Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education, for \\"world-class computer animation teaching with wide scientific and creative applications\\". In 2014 the courses at the university were praised by the Prime Minister in Parliament.Hansard, https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140305/debtext/140305-0001.htm Research Rankings and reputation Bournemouth University appeared for the first time in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings in 2015/16: ranked joint 401-500 in the world and 57th among UK universities. The university experienced a brief upward trend in national rankings: in 2016, it rose from 65th to 54th in The Complete University Guide, from 71st to 63rd place in The Guardian University League Table and from 88th to joint 82nd in the Sunday Times Good University Guide. The high salary increases awarded to Bournemouth University Vice Chancellor John Vinney were justified as a reflection of this improvement. Student life The Students' Union at Bournemouth University (SUBU) is based on the Talbot Campus at the Student Centre, which was opened in 2015. Its facilities are open to students at Lansdowne Campus and the partner colleges. SUBU has over 120 clubs and societies for students to take part in alongside their studies at Bournemouth University. SUBU itself is composed of various departments, such as SUBU Advice, Democracy and Equality, Representation, Volunteering, Insight and Policy and Activities. SUBU operates numerous venues including the nightclub The Old Fire station on the Lansdowne campus, the Student Shop, Ground Up Cafe and with Dylans Bar on Talbot.

The story is written by Ulrich Karger and illustrated by Uli Waas.  Plot summary  The book tells about a group of children having a Halloween sleepover party at school (Kindergarten). The children prepare for it by making decorations and costumes. As night draws near, so do the children's fears. One student, Mary, shares a trick her father taught her with the other students. He gave her a special bright star - whenever she feels afraid to go to bed, she has only to think about her star. This sends the darkness and the evil ghosts from her heart. Jonas does not believe in that, but he also thinks he is not afraid of ghosts. In the end, all the children need another, older trick: keeping the hallway light on all night.  Themes  The Scary Sleepover focuses on children who learn to overcome their fears of the dark by the example of a Halloween sleepover at school. Incidentally is detected: \\"The most boastful of the children becomes the most afraid. The Halloween setting with masks and long shadows in the dark is the perfect backdrop for this discussion.\\"Quote from: Sharon Salluzzo in childrenslit.com, Themed Reviews Halloween, October, 2002  Reception  Vicki Arkoff positively evaluates the text and the illustrations, but sees a problem especially for American readers: \\"Right off the bat it's clear that this simple picture book is a translated work because of its 'this would never happen in this country' premise. After all, how many parents do you know who let their pre-schoolers and kindergarteners have sleepovers at school?

It has two principal campuses: one in the centre of Coventry where the majority of its operations are located, and one in Central London which focuses on business and management courses. Coventry also governs their other higher education institutions CU Coventry, CU Scarborough and CU London, all of which market themselves as an \\"alternative to mainstream higher education\\". Its four faculties, which are made up of schools and departments, run around 300 undergraduate and postgraduate courses. Across the university there are 11 research centres which specialise in different fields, from transport to peace studies. In 2017, the university gained a Gold in the Teaching Excellence Framework (THE). Coventry is a member of the University Alliance mission group. History Coventry Municipal Art School Prospectus for the academic year 1927‚Äì1928 The origins of Coventry University can be traced back to the founding of the Coventry School of Design in 1843. Later renamed the Coventry School of Art, it was again renamed in the early 20th century to the Municipal Art School as part of the Education Act 1902. One final name change took place in the 1950s, when it became known as the College of Art. In the late 1950s, to address the need for a high level of technical training which the existing Coventry Technical College (now City College Coventry) could not meet, the construction of a new institution began. Opened in 1961, it was called the Lanchester College of Technology, named after the car engineer Frederick Lanchester. In 1970, the Lanchester College of Technology and the College of Art, along with the Rugby College of Engineering Technology in the neighbouring town of Rugby, amalgamated to form Lanchester Polytechnic. The institution was designated as such in February 1971 by then Education Secretary Margaret Thatcher. The name Lanchester gave the institution a certain degree of obscurity (it was often confused with both Lancaster and Manchester), notably when none of the contestants on the BBC Radio 4 general knowledge show Brain of Britain could give its correct location. The polytechnic cancelled its graduation ceremony in 1974 following the Birmingham pub bombings in fear that public gatherings could be targeted; the ceremony was eventually held in 2009, 35 years later. Lanchester Polytechnic was later renamed \\"Coventry Polytechnic\\" in 1987, and when the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 afforded Coventry Polytechnic university status that year, the name was changed to Coventry University. In 2010, a campus in London was established to further attract international students to the university. In 2012 \\"Coventry University College\\" was set up within the main university campus, offering qualifications up to degree-level at a lower cost compared to typical university fees. As of 2017 Coventry is the highest-ranked modern university in the UK in both the Guardian University Guide ‚Äì in which it ranks 12th overall ‚Äì and the Complete University Guide. It also places in the top 200 in the Times Higher Education Young University Rankings 2017, which ranks universities around the world that are aged 50 years or under. In July 2017, the university announced Margaret Casely-Hayford as its new chancellor, replacing Sir John Egan. The campus in Coventry is currently undergoing a ¬£430 million investment programme for the period up to 2022, with a new ¬£37 million science and health building and ¬£73 million student accommodation complex ‚Äì opening in 2017 and 2018 respectively ‚Äì central to the development scheme. In September 2019, Coventry purchased the 22-acre Ryton Organic Gardens from the charity Garden Organic, who remains on site as a tenant along with the Heritage Seed Library. Campus Priory Building. The building is used for Pre-Courses Coventry campus Coventry currently occupies a purpose-built campus in Coventry City Centre adjacent to Coventry Cathedral and the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum. It occupies a mix of new purpose-built buildings, converted structures, and those inherited from its predecessor institutions. The centrepiece of the campus is The Hub, an award-winning building which opened in August 2011. The Hub is the home of the Coventry University Students‚Äô Union, student support services, a bar/nightclub, a food hall and food outlets which are catered by Sodexo In September 2012, a new ¬£55 million engineering building was opened, with facilities such as a full-scale Harrier jump jet, a wind tunnel and flight simulators. The Hub was awarded a BREEAM 'excellent' rating and between them The Hub and the engineering building feature sustainable initiatives such as grey-water harvesting, a biomass boiler and a green roof. The opening of the buildings marks the first stage of a ¬£160 million redevelopment plan of the campus phased over 15 years. Coventry's ¬£20 million library opened in 2000 and is on the outskirts of the campus. It was officially opened by Princess Anne in September 2001 and contains over 2,000 print periodicals, 350,000 monographs, and more than 6,000 video tapes, audio tapes and films. The library has a distinctive turreted exterior and has won awards for its interior design which features a light distribution system to make the most of natural light throughout the building. Harrier T4 XW270 in the basement of the Engineering and Computing building There are two converted buildings on the campus. A former car engine factory built in 1910 located next to the university's library now houses the Coventry Business School, and a cinema built in 1880 on Jordan Well is currently home to the School of Media and Performing Arts, now part of the Faculty of Arts and Humanities, and formerly part of the Coventry School of Art and Design. To the south of the main campus is the Coventry University Technology Park, a business park owned by Coventry University Enterprises Limited, a commercial subsidiary of the university, and through which several of the university's commercial subsidiary operations provide business services to local and national organisations. Tenants of the park are small businesses which receive support from the university and are allowed access to the university's library. The park is also home to conference facilities at the TechnoCentre building, the Coventry and Warwickshire New Technology Institute, which works with companies to address skills shortages in ICT and advanced technology, and a digital lab for serious game and other technology development. Coventry has adopted a policy of naming its buildings after people or organisations with a significant local or regional impact. These include former Coventry-based automotive company Armstrong Siddeley; Shakespearean actress Ellen Terry; Coventry-based automotive pioneer Frederick Lanchester; Victorian novelist, critic and poet George Eliot; the father of the bicycle industry James Starley (building demolished in early 2020); former MP for Coventry East and political journalist Richard Crossman; artist Graham Sutherland; and founder of the Morris Motors automotive manufacturer William Morris. The Faculty of Engineering, Environment & Computing has a former RAF Harrier T.4 aircraft, tail number XW270, used as a teaching aid. = Gallery = File:Ellen Terry Arts and Media Building, Coventry by WTC The Nicholson Family.jpgThe Ellen Terry building is a former 20th century cinema that was refurbished in 2000 File:Graham Sutherland.JPGThe Graham Sutherland building is main building for Art and Design faculty CU Coventry CU Coventry was established on campus in 2012 and is an offshoot of Coventry University, providing full-time and part-time professional courses such as accounting, legal studies and marketing. CU Coventry is independent from the university with its own staff and facilities, though its programmes are validated and awarded by the university. Courses offered are flexible, meaning that tuition fees at the institution are often lower than the maximum ¬£9,250 universities in the UK can charge for full-time courses. The part-time nature of many of the courses delivered means classes can run at atypical times, such as evenings and weekends.  CU London  CU London was established as a new campus in 2017, offering a range of full-time and part-time courses in Dagenham, East London. Located in the former Dagenham Civic Centre, the campus focuses on ‚Äúhigh quality, low-cost, career-focused‚Äù education, which is flexibly structured to fit around students‚Äô lives. CU London has offered over ¬£95,000 in bursaries and scholarships to local students and schools in the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham to make higher education more accessible. CU Scarborough The University opened a new facility, CU Scarborough, in Scarborough, North Yorkshire in 2016, as part of a new ¬£45 million development, in the Weaponess area of the town. The University contributed ¬£12 million towards the project. Courses include Law, Science & Engineering. The site also incorporates a new sports and leisure village and University Technical College (UTC), for 14‚Äì18 year-olds.  Coventry University London  Coventry University's London campus was opened in 2010 as part of a trend seen by a number of different British universities, where a campus in London was set up with a predominately international student body to build the universities' international reputation. The campus operates out of University House, 109‚Äì117 Middlesex Street in the City of London, almost 100 miles southeast of Coventry. Coventry University Wroc≈Çaw Coventry University Wroc≈Çaw is a campus opening in September 2020, offering courses taught in English, including IT and cybersecurity, business, engineering, and hospitality and tourism. The University plans to accept 160 students in the first year. It is the first foreign university in Poland and will offer student exchange programs with Coventry University UK campuses. Structure and organisation Governance Coventry University is headed formally by the Chancellor, a largely ceremonial role, currently Margaret Casely-Hayford. The Chancellor is supported by six Pro-Chancellors and is appointed by the university's Board of Governors. Terms for the Chancellor and Pro-Chancellors are five years in length; the number of terms a Chancellor can serve is unrestricted while Pro-Chancellors are limited to two. The university is led on a day-to-day basis by the Vice-Chancellor, who is supported by four Deputy Vice-Chancellors and three Pro Vice-Chancellors. The position of Vice- Chancellor has been occupied by John Latham since March 2014. Coventry is a member of the University Alliance mission group, of which Latham is a former Chair.

Academic profile The Graham Sutherland building was built in 1959 and is used by the university's School of Art and Design Coventry offers more than 130 undergraduate degrees and 100 postgraduate degrees over its four faculties, as well as qualifications such as foundation degrees and Higher National Diplomas (HNDs). It has introduced the teaching of disaster management at undergraduate level (the first such course in the UK) as well as parapsychology and health journalism at the postgraduate level. The university's student body in consisted of students: undergraduates and postgraduates. Part-time students in 2013‚Äì14 made up 15% of undergraduates and 39% of postgraduates. The drop-out rate for first year undergraduates is 8.9% and the undergraduate intake from state schools is 97%. The university employs over 1,800 academic staff and is the fourth largest employer in Coventry. Tuition fees for undergraduate students at the university are variable and range from ¬£7,500 to ¬£9,000 depending on the degree programme, following the United Kingdom government's decision in 2010 to raise the maximum limit universities can charge UK and EU students. The university cited the variable fee structure in explaining the rise in applications received for 2012 compared to the previous year, despite an overall national fall. Research The Research Assessment Exercise 2008 classed that research conducted by the university in the subjects ‚ÄòAllied Health Professions and Studies‚Äô, ‚ÄòComputer Science and Informatics‚Äô, ‚ÄòElectrical and Electronic Engineering‚Äô, ‚ÄòLibrary and Information Management‚Äô, ‚ÄòPolitics and International Studies‚Äô, ‚ÄòSocial Work and Social Policy & Administration‚Äô, and ‚ÄòArt and Design‚Äô contained elements of 'world-leading' research.

It was founded in 2003, when the Recreational Products Division of Bombardier Inc. was sold off to a group of investors: Bain Capital (50%), the Bombardier family (35%) and the Caisse de d√©p√¥t et placement du Qu√©bec (15%). The parent company of the former division, Bombardier Inc., was founded in 1942 as L'Auto-Neige Bombardier Limit√©e (Bombardier Snowmobile Limited) by Joseph-Armand Bombardier at Valcourt in the Eastern Townships, Quebec. The newly formed independent company continued vehicle development in the same fields started 60 years earlier by its founder. , it had about 5,500 employees; its revenues in 2007 were above US$2.5 billion. BRP has manufacturing facilities in five countries: Canada, the United States (Wisconsin, Illinois, North Carolina and Arkansas), Mexico, Finland, and Austria. The company's products are sold in more than 100 countries, some of which have their own direct-sales network. BRP has multiple brands: Ski-Doo (snowmobiles), Can-Am motorcycles (ATVs and Can-Am Spyder and Ryker three-wheeled vehicles), Sea-Doo (personal watercraft), Lynx (snowmobile), Evinrude Outboard Motors, and Rotax. The Ski-Doo personal snowmobile brand is so iconic, especially in Canada, that it was listed in 17th place on the CBC's The Greatest Canadian Invention list in 2007. Snowmobiles A 1949 Bombardier B12 A J5 tractor and trailer, capable of snow or muskeg use Before the start of the company's development of track vehicles, Joseph-Armand Bombardier experimented with propeller-driven snow vehicles (similar to Russian aerosanis). His work with snowplane designs can be traced to before 1920. He quickly abandoned his efforts to develop a snowplane and turned his inventive skills to tracked vehicles. From the start, the company made truck-sized half-track vehicles, with skis in the front and caterpillar tracks in the rear, designed for the worst winter conditions of the flatland Canadian countryside. After producing half-tracks in World War II for the Canadian Army, the company experimented with new forms of track systems and developed an all-tracked, heavy duty vehicle designed for logging and mining operations in extreme wilderness conditions, such as heavy snow or semiliquid muskeg. They produced it under the name Muskeg tractor. Each track is composed of two or more rubber belts joined into a loop. The loops are held together with interior wheel guides and exterior cleats, commonly called grousers. The tracks are driven by a large drive sprocket that engages the grousers in sequence and causes the track to rotate. Two belt tracks were common on early model Bombardiers and muskeg machines. For deep-snow use, wider tracks, employing additional belts, are used for added flotation over the snow. The research for the track base made it possible to produce a relatively small, continuous-rubber track for the light one- or two-person snowmobile the founder of the company had dreamed about during his teen years. This led to the invention of snowmobiles. The company created the snowmobile market, and held its own after international competitors entered the market in the late 1960s. From the 1940s through the early 1970s, Bombardier built the most successful snowcat models ever produced by any snowcat manufacturer. The B12 seated 12 people, and the C18 seated 18. Both were similar in design with long tracks in the rear and skis used to steer the vehicle. The B12 and C18 were very fast for their day, with speeds over the snow exceeding 30 miles per hour. Most historic and most modern snowcats have a top speed of barely 20 mph. The Bombardier B12 and C18 were probably the precursors to the more modern snow coach currently used by resorts for transporting tourists. In their day, the B12 and C18 vehicles were used as school buses, mail delivery and emergency vehicles in northern United States and Canada, and were best suited to flat land conditions, frozen roadways, or frozen lakes. While more than 3,000 of the Bombardier B12/C18 variants were produced, Bombardier had competitors in both the North American and world markets. Most of the Bombardier production stayed in North American. The front ski design was incapable of being used in deep snow and rough ground conditions, which opened the door for the development of dual-track and quad-track snowcats. Unfortunately, the front ski design was not easily adapted to change for other ground conditions, so while it was successful on flat lands, frozen lakes, and snow-covered roads, it could not compete on rough, off-road conditions. The combination of the lack of design flexibility, incompatibility with off-road conditions, and the advent of modern snowplowing practices of public roadways beginning in the 1950s, and becoming common in remote areas by the 1960s, probably led to the demise of the B12/C18 design. Today, B12s are still in used in large-scale ice fishing in northern Canada. Notable competitors included the Aktiv Snow Trac ST4 from Sweden, Thiokol, and Tucker Sno-Cat from the USA. The Snow Trac was produced, virtually unchanged, until 1981, but it was successful, with over 2,000 units sold, and it was used all over the globe for exploration and commercial purposes, as well as the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo, Japan. Tucker Sno-Cat grew to become one of the world's largest builders of these vehicles, and currently produces a wide range of large commercial and exploration vehicles from its location in Medford, Oregon, USA. Thiokol produced many popular units, notably the Imp, Super Imp, and Spryte models, but changed ownership and name several times before going out of business in 2000 as the Logan Machine Company and manufacturer of the LMC brand. Development of the small snowmobile JVB between Tyin and Eidsbugarden. Armand dreamed of developing a fast, lightweight snowmobile that could carry one or two people. In the early 1950s, Armand set aside his dream to focus on developing his company's other tracked vehicles. But by the end of the decade, smaller, more efficient engines had been developed and were starting to come on the market. Armand resumed his efforts to build a \\"miniature\\" snowmobile. He worked alongside his eldest son Germain, who shared his father's mechanical talents. Armand and Germain developed several prototypes of the lightweight snowmobile and finally, the first Bombardier snowmobile went on sale in 1959. Bombardier BR180 snowcat pulling snowmobile trail groomer attachment Jumping with a Ski-Doo XRS 800 The Ski-Doo was originally intended to be named the \\"Ski-Dog\\" because Bombardier meant it to be a practical vehicle to replace the dogsled for hunters and trappers. By accident, a printer misinterpreted the name and printed \\"Ski-Doo\\" in the first sales brochure. Public interest in the small snowmobiles grew quickly. Suddenly a new winter sport was born, centred in Quebec. In the first year, Bombardier sold 225 Ski-Doos; four years later, 8,210 were sold. But Armand was reluctant to focus too much on the Ski-Doo and move resources away from his all-terrain vehicles. He vividly remembered his earlier business setbacks that forced him to diversify. Armand slowed down promotion of the Ski-Doo line to prevent it from dominating the other company products but still dominate the entire snowmobile industry. The snowmobiles produced were of exceptional quality and performance, earning a better reputation than the rival Polaris and Arctic Cat brands of motor sleds. In 1971, Bombardier completed the purchase of the Moto-Ski company to expand the Ski-Doo line and eliminate a competitor from the marketplace. Some of the sleds made by Ski-Doo are the Formula III, Mach 1, and Mach Z with Rotax engines. While it is a commonly held misconception that all Ski-Doo snowmobiles were powered by rotary valved engines, this is not true. Only two cylinder Rotax engines were equipped with rotary valves. As a rule, the later rotary valved sleds were liquid cooled as well. Fan cooled sleds were usually piston port (2-stroke) induction. Sleds such as the formula III, later model mach-1's and the mach Z were powered by three cylinder, 2-stroke, Rotax engines. In 1994 the company produced the first snowmobile equipped specifically for mountain riding, the Ski-Doo Summit. Ski-Doo snowmobiles have consistently been extremely competitive for performance and in the marketplace up to the current day, taking a number of national titles in racing events from Sno-X to hill-climbing. In 1999 Ski-Doo introduced the ZX aluminum chassis which was lighter weight with better suspension and thus very successful in sno-cross competition. In 2003 Ski-Doo introduced rider-forward REV chassis, which changed the sport and was followed by other manufacturers. In 2008 Ski-Doo introduced the XP chassis, which moved the rider further forward with major weight reduction. The XP was the lightest machine available, with power-to-weight ratios in the Summit models for the first time under 3 lb per HP. For the 2017 snow year, Ski-Doo will release its most powerful engine. The Rotax 850 cc \\"Etec\\" engine. The engine produces 10 more horsepower (170 hp) than its predecessor, it is also more efficient 40 percent less oil burn than the previous Etec. and 30 percent quicker throttle response; this engine paired with the new SP chassis which moves the rider even further forward and provides a big weight reduction over the XP chassis. This makes the 2017 the most capable snowmobile ever, reaching speed of upwards of 90 mph in the renegade models and climbing nearly straight up mountains at impressive speed in the Summit models. Motorcycles and ATVs During the 1970s, Bombardier built the Can-Am brand of off-road competition motorcycles designed for motocross and enduro with Rotax engines displacing 125, 175, 248 and 366 500 and 800 cc. The bikes competed successfully in professional racing with Gary Jones winning the 1974 US 250cc AMA motocross national championship. In 1983, Bombardier licensed the brand and outsourced development and production of the Can-Am motorcycles to Armstrong-CCM Motorcycles of Lancashire, England. 1987 was the last model year for Can-Am. In 2007 Bombardier renamed their all-terrain vehicle line of products Can-Am. Can-am Off-Road has seven models of ATVs, the Outlander, the Renegade, the Commander, The Maverick, the DS, the Traxter, the Quest, and the Rally. The Traxter and Quest (no longer in production) had two engine sizes 500cc and 650cc. The Rally (also no longer in production) was available with a 200cc engine. The Outlander is a utility style ATV available in multiple engine sizes, including 400cc and 450cc single cylinder and 500cc, 570cc, 650cc, 800cc, 850cc and 1000cc V-Twin engines. The Outlander MAX is available for 2-up riding and the Outlander X-MR is built specifically for mud riding. The Renegade is also available with multiple engine choices, a 500cc, 570cc, 800cc, 850cc or 1000cc V-Twin engine. The Renegade X-XC is a separate trim level built specifically for cross country racing. The Outlander 800R X-XC is a version of the Renegade with the same trim level for cross country racing and non-racing trail riding. The XT-P is the modern outlander XXC and features the XT package with front sway bar and beadlock wheels. The 1000cc engine was introduced into the quad classification in the 2012 model year for both the Outlander and the Renegade series. The DS has four engine choices, a 450cc, 250cc, 90cc and 70cc. A 650cc engine was once available but has since been discontinued. An \\"X\\" trim level is available for the DS-450 and the DS-90. The Commander is a SSV or Side by side introduced for 2010 with either 800cc or 1000cc engines. Commander has several trim levels, including XT, X and LTD (Limited) at the time the only engine option for the extra packages was the 1000. The XT had upgraded wheels, winch, front bumper and upgraded gauge and steering wheel. The X package had Bumpers, rock sliders, XT gauge and steering wheel, X package seats, and beadlock wheels. Commander Limited includes air ride suspension, an am/fm radio with four speakers, an iPod adapter, XT package and built-in touch screen GPS. All Can Am ATVs except the DS-70 and the DS-90 feature four-stroke Rotax engines. The maverick side by side was introduced to stand up to the commander's rival the Polaris RZR XP 900. The Maverick has an updated version of the commander's 1000cc V-Twin Rotax engine (1000R) this engine had a massive 101 horsepower. This was achieved by using high flow dynamics to increase exhaust and air flow. The maverick was a revolution into the horsepower triple digits. The maverick comes in 6 packages today (February 2014) Base, XRS, XRS DPS, XMR, X ds, and X ds Turbo. In the X ds lineup Can Am brought the first factory installed turbocharged engine to the industry. The turbo boosts the horsepower of the maverick from 101 horsepower to 121 horsepower. Invention of the three-wheeled roadster In 2007, BRP announced the launch of a new three-wheeled roadster called the Spyder, which was released in Q4 2007 under the Can-Am brand. This is the first vehicle from BRP to go on the road. Sailboats Beginning in the 1970s, Bombardier also built several sailboat models,https://sailboatdata.com/sailboat?filter%5Bname%5D=bombardier&paginate;=25&units;=imperial&sort;=name including the Invitation sailboat, with hull length of ; the Bombardier 3.8, with hull length of ; the Bombardier 4.8 and the Bombardier 7.6 keelboat.https://sailboatdata.com/sailboat/bombardier-76 Diversification In the 1970s and 1980s the company diversified into railway and aeronautical products and became a multinational corporation known as Bombardier Inc. Restructuring During restructuring operations in 2003 the original snowmobile and tracked utility vehicle division was spun off as a separate company, with majority ownership transferred to Bain Capital. Though the company is a major manufacturer of two stroke engines and four stroke motors for several industries it is better known for its consumer recreational products. They now make Ski-Doo and Lynx brand snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles, Sea-Doo personal water craft, jet boats, and Evinrude outboard motors (through the purchase of Outboard Marine Corporation). Bombardier Recreational Products no longer sells outboards under the Johnson brand since 2007, as they have moved all sales entirely to Evinrude Outboard Motors. They support existing Johnson outboard motors through servicing and parts. They also produce motorcycle motors, kart motors, and small airplane motors, through their Rotax division. In late August 2004 they sold the industrial vehicles division to the Camoplast company of Sherbrooke, Quebec. The industrial vehicles division made tracked utility vehicles such as snow grooming snowcats for skiing, sidewalk snow removal tractors and heavy duty tracked transporters, including the descendant of their original Muskeg tractor. In October 2005, Camoplast Industrial Inc. formed an alliance with the Leitner Group for the design, sales and support of the BR350 and BR180 grooming machines. Those machines are still manufactured by Camoplast in Granby, Quebec but are sold as Prinoth, the Leitner division for snow grooming machines and all-terrain vehicles. In October 2007, Bombardier Recreational Products Inc. ordered at least some U.S. ATV dealerships to stop selling vehicles to Canadian customers, as the sales were a violation of dealer agreements to respect assigned geographic boundaries. Bombardier also announced that the warranty on any craft purchased by a Canadian in the United States ‚Äì even if the purchase was initially made by an American - would be void. Newspaper articles revealed that some models were being sold in Canada for as much as 40% above prices in the U.S.Don't sell to Canadians, U.S. Bombardier dealer told In September 2012, the company announced that it would exit the sport boat business citing a decline in global sales in the marine industry. This meant the loss of 350 jobs, including most of those at a plant in Benton, Illinois. On May 29, 2013 the company announced the closing of an initial public offering of 12,200,000 subordinate voting shares of the company at a price of $21.50 per share resulting in gross proceeds to the company of approximately $262,300,000. The net proceeds from the offering were used to repay outstanding loans. The company's shares now trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange. On May 27, 2020, the company announced the discontinuation of its Evinrude E-TEC and E-TEC G2 outboard engines, the repurposing of its Sturtevant, WI, facility, and the closing of its Alumacraft operations in Arkadelphia, AR. The company stated that it had signed an agreement with Mercury Marine to support boat packages and continue to supply outboard engines to BRP boat brands.https://www.globenewswire.com/news- release/2020/05/27/2039793/0/en/BRP-Advances-Marine-Strategy-by-Focusing-on- Boats-and-New-Technologies.htmlnews.brp.com/news-releases/news-release- details/brp-advances-marine-strategy-focusing-boats-and-new-technologies See also * John Deere Buck (produced by Bombardier) * List of Bombardier recreational and snow vehicles * Roski, a former division References External links * Companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange Manufacturing companies of Canada Motor vehicle engine manufacturers Snowmobile manufacturers Canadian boat builders Motorcycle manufacturers of Canada Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1942 Canadian companies established in 1942 Bain Capital companies Estrie Companies listed on NASDAQ 2013 initial public offerings Engine manufacturers of Canada ","title":"Bombardier Recreational Products"},{"id":"703415","text":"Charles de Bourbon (1401 ‚Äì 4 December 1456) was the oldest son of John I, Duke of Bourbon and Marie, Duchess of Auvergne. He was Count of Clermont-en- Beauvaisis from 1424, and Duke of Bourbon and Auvergne from 1434 to his death, although due to the imprisonment of his father after the Battle of Agincourt, he acquired control of the duchy more than eighteen years before his father's death. In 1425, Charles renewed his earlier betrothal by marrying Agnes of Burgundy (1407‚Äì1476), daughter of John the Fearless. Charles entered a relationship with Jeanne de Bournan, together they had Louis de Bourbon, Count of Roussillon. Louis founded the House of Bourbon-Roussillon (Rossello). Louis is known for his many services to the State. As a reward for his loyalty and dedication to Louis XI during the League of the Public Weal conflict, Louis XI gave him in marriage his legitimized daughter Jeanne de Valois. Charles served with distinction in the Royal army during the Hundred Years' War, while nevertheless maintaining a truce with his brother-in-law and otherwise enemy, Philip III, Duke of Burgundy. Both dukes were reconciled and signed an alliance by 1440. He was present at the coronation of Charles VII where he fulfilled the function of a peer and conferred knighthood. Despite this service, he took part in the \\"Praguerie\\" (a revolt by the French nobles against Charles VII) in 1439‚Äì1440. When the revolt collapsed, he was forced to beg for mercy from the King, and was stripped of some of his lands. He died on his estates at Ch√¢teau de Moulins in 1456.

By country  Fiji A resolution was passed in public discussion that every year on May 14 as to be Girmit Remembrance Day. May 14 is the day that the Leonidas (the first ship of indentured Indians) arrived in Fiji in 1879. Throughout the country each year there are celebration in memory of the Girmityas and Indian culture. http://girmit.org/what-i-do/thakur-ranjit-singh/historic-girmit-day- marked-with-tears/ Grenada The 100th anniversary of the first arrival of Indians in Grenada was commemorated in 1957. This was the first ever commemoration of the day in Grenada. The next commemoration would occur more than five decades later in 2009. On 29 April 2009, the Government of Grenada declared that the 1st of May would officially be designated as Indian Arrival Day and observed annually alongside the existing Labour Day. The date was already a public holiday in Grenada, on account of Labour Day. The Government also announced that Boucherie Road, the road leading to the site of the arrival of the Maidstone, would be officially renamed Maidstone Road to honour the arrival of Indians in Grenada. The renaming was officially carried out in a ceremony at 10:30 AM at La Fortune Junction, St. Patrick on 2 May 2009. Governor General Sir Carlyle Glean unveiled a granite plaque commemorating the arrival of the first Indians in Grenada. The plaque bears the inscription, \\"On 1st May 1857, in this bay the sailing vessel \\"Maidstone\\" anchored and landed 287 passengers having left India three months earlier, with 304 passengers. Between the years 1857 and 1890 other ships anchored in this and other bays bringing a total of 3,200 persons from India to work as agricultural indentured labourers in Grenada. This monument is dedicated to those who became the genesis of the Indo-Grenadian population of our nation\\". Guyana In Guyana the holiday is celebrated in May commemorating the first arrival of indentured labourers from India to the country, on May 5, 1838. On this day, the workers arrived in Guyana to work in sugar plantations. Their descendants today comprise 44 percent of Guyana's population of over 750,000.http://www.overseasindian.in/2006/apr/news/24dia4.shtml Jamaica In 1995, the Government of Jamaica proclaimed May 10 Indian Heritage Day in recognition of the Indians‚Äô contribution to the social and economic development of the country. The arrival of the Indians more than 170 years ago is commemorated in stamps.https://repeatingislands.com/2009/05/07/jamaica- indian-heritage-day-is-may-10th/ Mauritius In Mauritius, the holiday is celebrated on November 2 to commemorate the arrival of Indian labourers. 65.8% of the total population is of Indian origins with Mauritius being the only African country with a Hindu majority.  Saint Lucia  The Indian Diaspora of St. Lucia, an association promoting Indo-Saint Lucian heritage, organized the first Indian Arrival Day celebrations in Saint Lucia on 6 May 2013. The association is campaigning for the Saint Lucian government to officially declare the 6th of May as Indian Arrival Day. Many other Caribbean nations observe Indian Arrival Day annually to commemorate the date when the first Indians arrived in their respective countries. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines The Parliament of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines enacted an Act of Parliament on 26 March 2007 officially declaring the 1st of June as Indian Arrival Day. The first official commemoration of the event was held on 1 June that year. The day is marked annually by a re-enactment of the landing of Indians at Indian Bay, Kingstown, followed by a procession to Heritage Square. Several Indian cultural events are also held to mark the occasion. The first International Indian Diaspora Conference was held for the first time on 1-3 June 2012. It was organized by the St. Vincent and the Grenadines Chapter of the Global Organization of People of Indian Origin International (GOPIO- SVG), in partnership with the SVG Indian Heritage Foundation, and under the patronage of the SVG Ministry of Tourism and Culture. This was the first international conference for the Indian diaspora held in the country. Similar conferences had been held in other Caribbean nations since 1975. The Government of the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines officially designated the 7th of October as Indian Heritage Day. Suriname In Suriname, Indian Arrival Day is celebrated on June 5. Trinidad and Tobago In Trinidad and Tobago Indian Arrival Day is celebrated on May 30th. Trinidad and Tobago was the first country to start this holiday.  History  Indian Arrival Day was first celebrated in Skinner Park, San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago, as the East Indian Centenary on May 30, 1945\\"Thousands Expected to Attend East Indian Centenary Today.\\" Trinidad Guardian, May 30, 1945. which marked the hundredth anniversary of the coming of Indians to Trinidad. The Acting Governor representing the Government of the United Kingdom attended indicating the significance of the observance. Other local dignitaries who addressed the large crowd included Timothy Roodal, George Fitzpatrick, Adrian Cola Rienzi, and Murli J. Kirpalani. Greetings were also read from Mahatma Gandhi, Lord Wavell, and Colonel Stanley, the Secretary of State for the Colonies. After the 1945 Centenary extravaganza, however, the celebration of the anniversary of May 30 gradually declined. By the 1950s, the Indians who were on the Fatel Razack as immigrants to Trinidad and Tobago were brought as \\"coolie\\" indentured laborers. By the early seventies only the Indian group was the Hindu Divine Life Society of the Chaguanas was staging an annual procession and ceremony under the name Indian Emigration Day. Indian Emigration Day, as it was called then, had been celebrated by various organizations after 1945 with limited success. By 1973 the latest was organized by the Divine Life Society, which had organized small annual processions in Chaguanas for Indian Emigration Day. By the late seventies even that small remembrance was dwindling. In 1976 the Indian Revival and Reform Association (IRRA) was formed. They were concerned about racism against Indians and were interested in developing ideas, writing pamphlets to bring about an Indian revival and renewed pride in Indian heritage and Indian culture. The IRRA wanted to preserve the good things about Indian heritage and reform the ones that were no longer useful or relevant. The anniversary of the coming of Indians to Guyana was one of the good things that came to the IRRA notice. In 1977 IRRA formed committee was established to revive the memory of the coming of Indians to Trinidad on May 30, 1845 ‚Äì Indian Emigration Day. The initial historic Committee comprised Anand Rameshwar Singh, Khalique Khan, Ramdath Jagessar, Rajiv Sieunarine, Azamudeen \\"Danny\\" Jang, Michael Sankar and Rajesh Harricharan. The following year Rajnie Ramlakhan, Anand Maharaj and Ashok Gobin joined in the group's celebration. The first active step was taken in early 1978, when they produced and distributed a one-page pamphlet with the title ‚ÄúIndian Emigration Day May 30, 1978‚Äù. It gave a brief account of the coming of Indians in 1845, and the importance of the event. The names of the first pioneers on the Fatel Razack were listed, and there was a short description of the achievements of Indians in Trinidad since 1845. The Trinidad Express carried a press release, and the Trinidad Guardian printed an article by Kusha Haracksingh on the voyage of the Fatel Razack. Mastana Bahar dedicated a show to Indian Emigration Day. San Fernando Secondary School organized a celebration. A major turning point occurred in 1979 when the group expanded by approaching the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha. The SDMS Secretary General Satnarayan Maharaj receptive to the idea, agreed to organize a major celebration at Lakshmi Girls College on May 27, 1979. IRRA and the SDMS in discussions agreed that Indians were no longer emigrants to Trinidad and Tobago, but citizens who had arrived 134 years before. Coming out of this discussion the name was then changed to Indian Arrival Day. The 1979 celebration was a great success and included the presence of some of the original immigrants born in British India. Government ministers Sham and Kamal Mohammed were there, as was the Indian High Commissioner and Presbyterian Church moderator Idris Hamid. The event was widely covered by the local media and immediately knew about the event. In fact it took just two years and an idea to revive the memory of the Arrival of Indians in Trinidad and Tobago to awaken the entire Indian community in Trinidad and Tobago. Subsequent years the Hindu Seva Sangh and other smaller groups approached the IRRA for guidance in developing in various communities throughout Trinidad and Tobago. By 1980 Indian Arrival Day celebrations were held at the Spring Village, Cedros, Couva, Penal, San Juan, Chaguanas, and many other parts of the country. The National Joint Action Committee, the Catholic Church, other churches, libraries, masjids, mandirs, and schools at this point joined in the observances. In a remarkably short time, Indian Arrival Day was sweeping through the country. By 1985 there were more than 10 significant Indian Arrival Day celebrations taking place. The Hindu community took the lead in the development of the celebrations. In 1991 Members of Parliament Trevor Sudama and Raymond Pallackdarrysingh first introduced to the House of Representatives the concept that Indian Arrival Day should be made a national public holiday. This call to make Indian Arrival Day a public holiday continued to be unheeded until 1995 Prime Minister Patrick Manning declared that the 150th Anniversary would be a public holiday called Indian Arrival Day, but thereafter the holiday will be called Arrival Day. The 1995 celebrations surpassed the 1945 celebrations with the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha having major celebrations in Trinidad and Tobago In 1996 Prime Minister Basdeo Panday declared that 30 May would be known as Indian Arrival Day and not Arrival Day. However, in the birthplace of Indian Arrival Day ‚Äì Trinidad and Tobago ‚Äì there is a lobby to remove the word 'Indian' from the name. In the 1990s the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha expanded the Indian Arrival Day celebrations and dubbed May as \\"Indian Heritage Month\\" which ends on Indian Arrival Day. Observances in different countries Since its establishment in Trinidad and Tobago, Indian Arrival Day has given rise to similar celebrations in Fiji, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Mauritius, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. However, there is no similar celebration in Malaysia, Singapore, R√©union, Seychelles, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, or Kenya, which are also home to somewhat large Indian-origin populations.

He was made constable of France in 1483 by his brother Peter and sister-in-law Anne, to neutralize him as a threat to their regency. In an effort to win discontented nobles back to his side, Louis XI of France made great efforts to give out magnificent gifts to certain individuals; John was a recipient of these overtures. According to contemporary chronicles, the King received John in Paris with \\"honours, caresses, pardon, and gifts; everything was lavished upon him\\".Bingham (1890), p. 27. In further attempts to gain the nobles' favor, the King proposed a match between his eldest legitimized daughter Marguerite to John's eldest illegitimate son Louis de Bourbon. The marriage was celebrated in Paris with royal magnificence and the wedded couple were heaped with honors and wealth by the King. It has been said despite all of his brilliant marriages, nothing flattered John more than this particular marriage between his natural son and a legitimized daughter of the King. John is notable for making three brilliant alliances but leaving no legitimate issue. First Marriage In 1447, his father, the Duke of Bourbon, had John married to a daughter of Charles VII, King of France, Joan of Valois. They were duly married at the Ch√¢teau de Moulins.

He had a 2-week tenure as Duke of Bourbon in 1488, being ousted afterward by his younger brother and successor, Peter II, Duke of Bourbon. Biography An hereditary member of the House of Bourbon through Charles I, Duke of Bourbon and Agnes of Burgundy, Charles II, being a younger son, was appointed Canon of Lyon in 1443 and soon after, on June 6, 1444, elected Archbishop of Lyon at the age of 11. This election followed the death of Amed√©e de Talaru and the renunciation of John III of Bourbon, illegitimate offspring of his grandfather John I, Duke of Bourbon. His office was confirmed by Pope Eugene IV on November 14, 1446 after the death of Geoffroy Vassal, Archbishop of Vienne who the pope had first appointed in disregard of the Pragmatic Sanction in 1444. Due to his age, Charles II's archiepiscopate was administered in succession by Jean Rolin, bishop of Autun, from 1446 to 1447, Du Gu√©, bishop of Orl√©ans, from 1447 to 1449, and John III of Bourbon, bishop of Puy, from 1449 to 1466. At that time, he still maintained a good relationship with the King of France Louis XI, showing greater gusto for navigating the intrigue of secular politics than displaying the piety expected of his religious position. On account of these proclivities, after the conflict surrounding the League of the Public Weal in 1465, Louis XI sent Charles II with Thibaud of Luxembourg, Bishop of Mans as ambassadors to Pope Paul II, recently elected in 1464. On January 7, 1469 Charles II signed a royal letters patent as the king's adviser, at Plessis-l√®z-Tours, the latter's main residence near Tours. As namesake, he was, along with Joan of Valois, Duchess of Bourbon and Edward of Westminster, godparent of the Dauphin Charles VIII. When Louis XI ended the Hundred Years' War in 1475, the archbishop assisted him in diplomatic matters while the king lives with Charles II at the Notre-Dame-de-la-Victoire-l√®s-Senlis abbey near Senlis. He arrives with Louis XI and his elder brother John II of Bourbon on August 19 at Picquigny to sign the eponymous treaty. Later, on October 16 he signed in the abbey a letters patent to reestablish peaceable relations with Francis II, Duke of Brittany. Again, on January 8, 1476, as the head of the King's Council, Charles II signs four letters patent, among them one concerning the liberty of the Gallican Church at Ch√¢teau de Plessis-l√®z-Tours. From 1472 to 1476, he was incumbent as the papal legate at Avignon though he only arrived there November 23, 1473. On May 23, 1474, the Pope Sixtus IV appoints his nephew Giuliano della Rovere as bishop of Avignon, and 2 years later as legate. This set Louis XI and the pope into conflict, with the royal army and papal troops coming to bear. On June 15, 1476, to resolve this difficulty, the king welcomed Giuliano della Rovere at Lyon, so that Charles II accepted the loss of the Avignon legation. This is the reason why, in 1476, he became the administrator of the diocese of Clermont and was made a Cardinal by Sixtus IV. It seems that after leaving Avignon, Charles II followed again in the wake of Louis XI. The cardinal was present with the king at Arras on March 18, 1477, during the campaign following the death of Charles the Bold. He was in 1486 the first commendatory abbot of the Priory Notre-Dame de La Charit√©-sur-Loire. He was also a noted patron of the arts, lavishing money on Lyon's cathedral - the Bourbon chapel there, which he sponsored from 1486 onward (it was continued after his death by his brother, Peter II of Bourbon) was described as \\"one of the marvels of decorative art in the 15th century\\". He was also Duke of Bourbon and Auvergne for a short period of time in April 1488, succeeding his elder brother, John II when the latter died on April 1. This prompted Charles II, as his brother's nearest heir, to claim the family inheritance in the Bourbonnais and Auvergne. The move was not tolerated by his younger brother, Peter, and Peter's wife, Anne of France, the latter immediately taking possession of the Bourbon lands by force on 10 April. On 15 April, members of the King's Council sent by Anne to \\"console the Cardinal on the occasion of his brother's death\\", forced him to sign a renunciation of any claims to the Bourbon lands, in exchange for a financial settlement. Charles then died later in the same year in mysterious circumstances, following a sudden collapse in a private house in Lyons. His brief tenure of the title during the period 1 April-15 April would, however, be posthumously confirmed in 1505, when Charles de Montpensier acceded to the Duchy as Charles III. Charles II had with Gabrielle Bartine an illegitimate daughter, Isabelle, later made legitimate by Charles VIII, who then married Gilbert of Chantelot, lord of La Chaise (Mon√©tay-sur-Allier), dying in 1497. In fiction Charles II of Bourbon features in Victor Hugo's novel The Hunchback of Notre-Dame (Chapter III: Monsieur the Cardinal). It evokes the titles and the parentage of Charles II in these words: \\"Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon, Archbishop and Comte of Lyon, Primate of the Gauls, was allied both to Louis XI, through his brother, Pierre, Seigneur de Beaujeu, who had married the king's eldest daughter, and to Charles the Bold through his mother, Agnes of Burgundy.\\" Sources Bibliography   Parts of this article were translated and adapted from the French Wikipedia article ¬´ :fr:Charles II de Bourbon ¬ª (version used), with reference to ¬´ :fr:Jean Ier de Bourbon ¬ª (version used) and ¬´ :fr:Jean III de Bourbon ¬ª (version used) for further details.

It has its roots in The Institution For The Diffusion Of Useful Knowledge founded in 1828. Subsequently, known as Harris Art College, then Preston Polytechnic, then Lancashire Polytechnic, in 1992 it was granted university status by the Privy Council. The university is the 19th largest in the UK in terms of student numbers., referenced at List of UK universities by size History The Institution for the Diffusion of Knowledge was founded in 1828 by Joseph Livesey's Temperance Society. The society was born from a pledge made by seven Preston working men (whose names can be seen on a plaque in the university's library) to never again consume alcohol. The institute was housed in a classical-revivalist building on Cannon Street, before eventually expanding under the endowment of a local lawyer, Edmund Robert Harris, who died in 1877. The expansion brought with it several new buildings and houses in the nearby Regent Street were purchased and demolished as a consequence. The institute became a regional centre for the arts and sciences. As part of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 1897, the institutes trustees paid the Victorian/Edwardian architect Henry Cheers to design the \\"Victoria Jubilee Technical School\\" (later known as the Harris Institute and now known as the Harris Building), to be built on Corporation Street. Its goal was to provide local youths with a technical education in all areas. The building was progressive for the period, being powered entirely by electricity. The institute existed in this state until 1932 when it changed its name to become the Harris Art College. It underwent further expansion and in 1952 and became the Harris College. In 1973 this became Preston Polytechnic then the Lancashire Polytechnic in 1984. In 1992, full university status was awarded and the University of Central Lancashire came into existence. The first chancellor of the university was Sir Francis Kennedy and he was succeeded in 2001 by Sir Richard Evans. In 2016, Ranvir Singh became the new Chancellor of the University. The journalism division, now part of the School of Journalism and Media, is one of the oldest in the country, opening as part of the Harris College in 1962. In 1991, it became one of the first to teach journalism undergraduate degrees, with a strong emphasis on practical work. In 2013 the School of Dentistry and the School of Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education merged to create the School of Medicine and Dentistry. The university sponsored the now defunct Wigan UTC, a university technical college which opened in September 2013.http://www.wiganutc.org/partners Campus The university is on an urban campus in Preston and others in Burnley, Westlakes in West Cumbria for nuclear and energy related research programmes and a ‚Ç¨53 million campus in Cyprus opened in October 2012.

Early life  Portrait of Suzanne executed for the Duke and Duchess of Bourbon. It is the right wing of a Bourbon triptych. Suzanne was born the second child and only daughter of Duke Peter II of Bourbon by his wife and Anne of France, herself the eldest daughter of Louis XI of France. From 1483 to 1491, Suzanne's parents served as co-regents of France during the minority of Anne's younger brother, Charles VIII of France. Furthermore, Anne's younger sister (and Suzanne's aunt), Joan, was (briefly) queen of France as wife of Louis XII of France, who succeeded Charles VIII in 1498. Succession Suzanne had an elder brother, Charles, who was born in 1471 and died unmarried in 1498. After this death at the age of 27, Suzanne's father grew concerned about the succession of the Bourbon lands, having no surviving sons or brothers. According to the prevalent Salic law of France, his heir presumptive was Louis de Bourbon-Montpensier, head of the Montpensiers, a cadet branch of the Bourbons. Montpensier was Suzanne's second cousin, their grandfathers being brothers. The year 1498 saw Anne's brother King Charles VIII die suddenly, after hitting his head on a low doorway. As no male heirs remained, the succession of France itself was now in question, for the closest agnatic dynast, Louis XII was a distant second-cousin, once removed, to Charles VII (and to Anne). Having served as Charles' co-regents, the powerful couple held enough influence to hinder the succession of Louis XII. They made a clever bargain with him: for the Bourbon support of his accession, Louis XII would have to recognize the seven-year-old Suzanne as her father's rightful heir of the Bourbon lands, and to issue official letters to that effect. Louis had little choice but to agree to this innovative solution, at least for the moment. This ancient Salic law which precluded the succession of females, became the cornerstone of French laws and customs. Indeed, that very old law allowed Louis, rather than Anne, to succeed to the throne of France. To Anne's credit, when she handed over Bourbon lands to Louis XII, the last independent duchy in France was in good stead, being both prosperous and peaceful. In 1503, Pierre died and Suzanne became duchess. During her minority years her mother Anne was regent. Anne groomed the intelligent Suzanne with the thought of her daughter ascending to the throne. Lessons included astronomy, mathematics and religious studies. But more importantly, Anne taught her the ways of the court. Beyond the social graces, being kind, well-spoken and social were also key. But the most important lesson she imparted upon her daughter was to never reaction to anything told her and to keep her thoughts to herself, less they somehow betray her. Anne knew only too well that the politics of the court were often underhanded if not treacherous. Duchess As the agnatic heir to the Bourbon lands, Louis II, Count of Montpensier, was a suitable young man, and as marriage with him would avert a struggle for the succession (quite inevitable otherwise), Suzanne's parents initially groomed him as their future son-in-law, despite the concession they had extracted from Louis XII regarding the succession. However, the teenage Montpensier mortally offended Peter by condemning and denouncing the letters patent concerning the succession which Louis XII had issued, and asserting that succession to the Bourbon lands and titles was his own patrimony and birthright and not something he needed to thank his wife or her father for. An enraged Peter decided to betroth Suzanne to Charles IV, Duke of Alen√ßon, a great favourite of Louis XII, and therefore likely to be able to protect the duchy against both Bourbon-Montpensier challenges and royal encroachment. Anne was not in favour of this arrangement because of the political complications it would certainly cause, since Bourbon-Montpensier would definitely pursue his dynastic claim. However, Peter prevailed and the contract of betrothal was signed on 21 March 1501 at Moulins, Alen√ßon being eleven years old and Suzanne nine. Two years later, and before the wedding could be solemnised, Peter died of a fever. Incidentally, Louis of Montpensier had also died before this, and had been succeeded by his younger brother Charles. With Peter and Louis both dead, the issues which had plagued their relationship could also be laid to rest. Anne broke off the arrangement with Alen√ßon and arranged for Suzanne to marry the next Bourbon heir-male, Charles,\\"The Man who Sacked Rome\\", by Vincent Pitts thereby averting a succession dispute over the Bourbon inheritance.\\"Queens Mate\\" by Pauline Matarasso On 10 May 1505, at Ch√¢teau du Parc-les-Moulins, Suzanne was married to Charles. He was immediately made co- ruler of the Bourbon lands. After the wedding, the duke and duchess of Bourbon made a tour through their domains along with Anne, something they would repeat many times during their rule. It does not appear that Suzanne participated in state affairs: her husband and her mother jointly managed the affairs of the duchies and were described as good partners in administration and politics. Duchess Suzanne reportedly suffered from delicate health and was frequently described by chronicles as being of a ‚Äògeneral disposition‚Äô and having a ‚Äòdeformity‚Äô, though her condition is not described more closely. A son was born to Charles and Suzanne on 17 July 1517 and was baptised Francis in October 1517 in honour of Charles' good friend King Francis I of France. The child was given the title Count of Clermont. However, he died after a few months. Suzanne later gave birth to stillborn (or short-lived) twins. Suzanne died at Ch√¢teau de Ch√¢tellerault in 1521. She was buried in Souvigny Priory, Souvigny. Her health had been frail throughout her last years. Her mother, who had always been fearful about her daughter's health, outlived her by one year. Her widower remained duke. He never remarried and died childless in 1527, after which the lands of the dukes of Bourbon were merged into the kingdom of France. Legacy The death of Suzanne and Charles marked respectively the extinctions of the two senior-most branches of the Bourbon family, namely Suzanne's natal \\"Bourbon\\" branch and Charles's \\"Bourbon-Montpensier\\" branch. The agnatic heir to both was their fifth cousin, Charles, Duke of Vend√¥me, head of the \\"Bourbon-Vendome\\" branch, which came to be called simply \\"the House of Bourbon\\" because it was now the senior-most branch. (The elder branches of the House of Bourbon were descended in the male line from Peter I, Duke of Bourbon whereas the Bourbon-Vendome branch was descended in the male line from Peter's younger brother James I, Count of La Marche.) Indeed, the Bourbon-Vendome branch was destined also to inherit the throne of France: Charles, Duke of Vend√¥me was the grandfather of Henry IV of France, the first \\"Bourbon\\" king of France.

He was appointed to the Order of Saint Michael by King Charles VIII of France in October 1483. Life Gilbert was the first person, after a number of divisions of Auvergne in the Middle Ages, to carry the bloodlines of the respective dynasties of each of the three main divisions of Auvergne, the countship, the dukedom and the dauphinate. His paternal grandmother Marie of Berry, Duchess of Bourbon, was heiress to the duchy of Auvergne. The creation for the Berry and Bourbon branches was made of lands that were confiscated from the count of Auvergne by Philip II of France. His paternal great- grandmother Anne of Auvergne was daughter of the Dauphin of Auvergne and after the extinction of her brother's line, in her issue the heiress thereof. Though Gilbert was by no means the primogenitural heir to any of them, as head of the cadet branch of his family, he received Montpensier and the dauphinate as appanages inside the extended family.

He was also the constable of France from 1515 to 1521. Also known as the constable of Bourbon, he was the last of the great feudal lords to oppose the king of France. He commanded the troops of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V in what became known as the Sack of Rome in 1527, where he was killed. Family Charles was born at Montpensier, the second son of Count Gilbert of Montpensier by his wife Clara Gonzaga (1 July 1464- 2 June 1503). Gilbert died in 1496, and his elder son, Louis II, died unwed in 1501, leaving Charles the heir to the family's titles and extensive lands in Auvergne.Pardoe, Julie, The Court and Reign of Francis the First, King of France, (Lea and Blanchard:Philadelphia, 1849), 39. Marriage Charles married his agnatic second cousin, Suzanne, Duchess of Bourbon. It was a dynastic match, intended to settle the question of succession to the Bourbon estates, which had arisen because Suzanne's father, Duke Peter II of Bourbon, the last of the senior Bourbon line, had died without sons. Charles was the scion of the next-senior Bourbon line, and thus the heir male of the House of Bourbon, while Suzanne was the heir general. With the marriage, Charles's position as Duke of Bourbon became undisputed. This cementing of position was important for another reason: with the death of Charles IV, Duke of Alen√ßon in 1525, Charles became the next in line to the French throne after the three sons of French King Francis I. Career A 19th century portrait of Charles III, Duke of Bourbon in battle armor. Already distinguished as a soldier in the Italian Wars, Charles was appointed constable of France by Francis I of France in 1515, and was rewarded for his services at the Battle of Marignano (where he commanded the vanguard) with the Governorship of Milan.Duruy, Victor, Martha Ward Carey, and John Franklin Jameson, A history of France, (Thomas Y. Crowell and Co.:Boston, 1889), 301. However, Francis was uneasy with the proud and wealthy duke, and soon recalled him from Milan and refused to honor his debts. Charles was further angered by the appointment of Charles IV of Alen√ßon, Francis's brother-in-law, as commander of the vanguard during the campaigns in the Netherlands, an office which should have been his. The death of his wife in 1521 provoked the final breach between Charles and Francis. Suzanne had left all her estates to Charles, but the king's mother, Louise of Savoy, claimed them as the heir in proximity in blood due to their previous entailments. She proposed to settle the question by marrying Charles; he refused the proposal because Louise was over forty-five years of age and fourteen years older than him. On behalf of his mother, Francis confiscated a portion of the Bourbon estates before the lawsuit had even been opened. Seeing no hope of prevailing, Charles made a secret agreement to betray his king and offer his services to Emperor Charles V. The emperor, the constable, and King Henry VIII of England devised a grand plan to partition France. This however came to nothing because the plot was discovered; Charles was stripped of his offices and proclaimed a traitor. He fled into Italy in 1523 and entered the imperial service. In 1524, he drove the French under Bonnivet from Lombardy, and fought at the Battle of Pavia. The emperor gave Charles command of a mixed Spanish-German army (which included a number of Lutherans) sent to chastise Pope Clement VII. He neglected to supply this army with money or food, and Charles was only able to keep it together by promises of loot. Though Clement arranged a truce with the emperor, the army continued its advance, reaching Rome in May 1527. The death of Charles ‚Äî the artist and goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini claimed that he fired the shot that killed him ‚Äî outside the walls removed the last restraints from the army, which resulted in the sack of Rome.Treat, James, The Catacombs of Rome, (The Old Corner Bookstore Inc.: Boston, 1907), 81. Progeny and succession By Suzanne, Charles was the father of twins and of Francis of Bourbon, Count of Clermont. Officially, since neither survived a year of age, the senior line of the dukes of Bourbon was extinct in male line with his death in battle, and the junior line (dukes of Vend√¥me) were not allowed to inherit, because Charles had forfeited his fiefs by committing treason. However, the county of Montpensier and dauphinate of Auvergne (but not the duchy of Bourbon) were later returned to his sister Louise.

The term is modern, and as such was mainly used to refer to smallsword fencing, but by extension it can also be applied to any martial art involving the use of a sword. The formation of the English word \\"swordsman\\" is parallel to the Latin word gladiator,Etymology Online a term for the professional fighters who fought against each other and a variety of other foes for the entertainment of spectators in the Roman Empire. The word gladiator itself comes from the Latin word gladius, which is a type of sword. African swordsmanship Sherden guards with double-edge swords North Africa The sword in ancient Egypt was known by several names, but most are variations of the words sfet, seft or nakhtui. The earliest bronze swords in the country date back 4000 years. Four types of sword are known to have been used: the ma or boomerang-sword based on the hunting stick, the kat or knife-sword, the khopesh or falchion based on the sickle, and a fourth form of straight longsword. The khopesh was used region-wide and is depicted as early as the Sixth Dynasty (3000 BC). It was thick-backed and weighted with bronze, sometimes even with gold hilts in the case of pharaohs. The blade may be edged on one or both sides, and was made from copper alloy, bronze, iron, or blue steel. The double-edge grip-tongue sword is believed to have been introduced by the Sherden and became widely dispersed throughout the Near East. These swords are of various lengths, and were paired with shields. They had a leaf-shaped blade, and a handle which hollows away at the centre and thickens at each end. Middle Eastern swords became dominant throughout North Africa after the introduction of Islam, after which point swordsmanship in the region becomes that of Arabian or Middle Eastern fencing. Sub-Saharan Africa Among some communities, swords were restricted to royalty or tribal leaders. Forms vary from one area to another, such as the billao of Somalia, boomerang-sword in Niger or the single-edge swords of the Gold Coast. The Abyssinian shotel took the form of a large sickle, like the Egyptian khopesh, with a small 4 inch wooden handle. The edge was on the inside of the blade, which has a mid-rib running along its entire length. Double-edge swords similar to those of Europe and ancient Arabia occurred in some areas such as the takoba and kaskara. Two types of sword existed in Zanzibar: the foot-long shortsword and the standard sword with a blade measuring 3‚Äì3.5 feet and a cylindrical pommel. The latter weapon was wielded with both hands like a quarterstaff. European swordsmanship Classical history Roman gladius Greece provides the foundation for the widespread use of the sword as a weapon in its own right in the West. The Roman legionaries and other forces of the Roman military, until the 2nd century A.D., used the gladius as a short thrusting sword effectively with the scutum, a type of shield, in battle. Gladiators used a shorter gladius than the military. The spatha was a longer double-edged sword initially used only by Celtic soldiers, later incorporated as auxilia into Roman Cavalry units; however by the 2nd century A.D. the spatha was used throughout much of the Roman Empire. The Empire's legionary soldiers were heavily trained and prided themselves on their disciplinary skills. This probably carried over to their training with weaponry, but we have no Roman manuals of swordsmanship. One translation of Juvenal's poetry by Barten Holyday in 1661 makes note that the Roman trainees learned to fight with the wooden wasters before moving on to the use of sharpened steel. In fact, it is also found that Roman gladiators trained with a wooden sword, which was weighted with lead, against a straw man or a wooden pole known as a palus (an early relative of the later wooden pell).L. Friedlander-Drexel. Darstellungen aus der Sittengeschichte Roms per Michael Grant. Gladiators page 40. Barnes and Noble, 1967. Mention from Clements, John. Get thee a waster! This training would have provided the Roman soldier with a good foundation of skill, to be improved upon from practical experience or further advanced training. Post-classical history Little is known about early medieval fencing techniques save for what may be concluded from archaeological evidence and artistic depiction (see Viking Age arms and armour). What little has been found, however, shows the use of the sword was limited during the Viking age, especially among the Vikings themselves and other northern Germanic tribes. Here, the spear, axe and shield were prominent weapons, with only wealthy individuals owning swords. These weapons, based on the early Germanic spatha, were made very well. The technique of pattern welding of composite metals, invented in the Roman Empire around the end of the 2nd century A.D., provided some of these northern weapons superior properties in strength and resilience to the iron gladius of early Rome. MS I.33 manuscript, dated to ca. 1290, shows fencing with the arming sword and the buckler. As time passed, the spatha evolved into the arming sword, a weapon with a notable cruciform hilt common among knights in the Medieval Age. Some time after this evolution, the earliest known treatises (Fechtb√ºcher) were written, dealing primarily with arming sword and buckler combat. Among these examples is the I.33, the earliest known Fechtbuch. The German school of swordsmanship can trace itself most closely to Johannes Liechtenauer and his students, who later became the German masters of the 15th century, including Sigmund Ringeck, Hans Talhoffer, Peter von Danzig and Paulus Kal. It is possible that the Italian fencing treatise Flos Duellatorum, written by the Italian swordmaster Fiore dei Liberi around 1410, has ties to the German school. During this period of time, the longsword grew out of the arming sword, eventually resulting in a blade comfortably wielded in both hands at once. Armour technology also evolved, leading to the advent of plate armour, and thus swordsmanship was further pressed to meet the demands of killing a very well protected enemy. For much of the early medieval period, the sword continued to remain a symbol of status. During later years, production techniques became more efficient, and so, while the sword remained a privilege, it was not so heavily confined to only the richest individuals, but rather to the richest classes. Modern history The military importance of swordsmanship rapidly diminished with the advent of firearms. The last prominent battlefield sword to be used was the backsword. Although it was not a new invention, it managed to outlast other forms of war swords, being used by cavalry units and officers. The power, accuracy, and reliability of firearms continued to improve, however, and soon swords had little place on the battlefield aside from ceremonial purposes. The preferred civilian dueling weapon shifted from the rapier to the faster but shorter smallsword, and eventually shifted totally away from swords to the pistol, following developments in firearm technology. The civilian affair of dueling was banned in most areas, but persisted to some degree regardless of law until well into the 20th century. =Renaissance= Sabre duel of German students, around 1900, painting by Georg M√ºhlberg (1863‚Äì1925) The German school of swordsmanship, in general, faced a decline during the Renaissance as the Italian and Spanish schools, which tilted more toward the rapier and civilian dueling, took the forefront. The compendium compiled by Paulus Hector Mair in the 1540s looks back to the preceding century of work and attempts to reconstruct and preserve a failing art. The treatise by Joachim Meyer, dating to the 1570s and notable for its scientific and complete approach to the style (it is suggested that Meyer's students came to him with less military knowledge and therefore required more basic instruction), is the last major account of the German school, and its context is now almost entirely sportive. The use of the longsword continued to decline throughout the Renaissance period, marked by the increased effectiveness of the arquebus (a firearm) and the use of pike squares as a powerful implement of battle. During this time, civilian swords evolved to side-swords, also known as \\"cut and thrust\\" swords, and progressed towards the thicker, tapering sword that eventually became the 17th century rapier. This new weapon was popular for both protection on the street and as a tool in the duel, but found little success on the battlefield. The Italian, French, and Spanish schools embraced this change in civilian armament and developed systems of rapier fencing. The German school, however, provides little on this weapon and ceases its prevalence thereafter. =Development into a sport= 1763 fencing print from Domenico Angelo's instruction book. Angelo was instrumental in turning fencing into an athletic sport. The need to train swordsmen for combat in a nonlethal manner led fencing and swordsmanship to include a sport aspect from its beginnings, from before the medieval tournament right up to the modern age.Antonio Manciolino, in the beginning of his 1531 manual, gives point values for the various body parts. Masaniello Parise supplemented his 1884 fencing manual with a small work, Spada da Terreno in which he gave the reader some general advice for the duel as well as covering which techniques most appropriate to use. The shift towards fencing as a sport rather than as military training happened from the mid-18th century, and was led by Domenico Angelo, who established a fencing academy, Angelo's School of Arms, in Carlisle House, Soho, London in 1763.F.H.W. Sheppard, ed. Survey of London volume 33 The Parish of St. Anne, Soho (north of Shaftesbury Avenue), London County Council, London: University of London, 1966, pp. 143‚Äì48, online at British History Online. There, he taught the aristocracy the fashionable art of swordsmanship which they had previously had to go the continent to learn, and also set up a riding school in the former rear garden of the house. He was fencing instructor to the Royal Family. With the help of artist Gwyn Delin, he had an instruction book published in England in 1763 which had 25 engraved plates demonstrating classic positions from the old schools of fencing. His school was run by three generations of his family and dominated the art of European fencing for almost a century. He established the essential rules of posture and footwork that still govern modern sport fencing, although his attacking and parrying methods were still much different from current practice. Although he intended to prepare his students for real combat, he was the first fencing master yet to emphasize the health and sporting benefits of fencing more than its use as a killing art, particularly in his influential book 'L'√âcole des armes (The School of Fencing), published in 1763. According to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, \\"Angelo was the first to emphasize fencing as a means of developing health, poise, and grace. As a result of his insight and influence, fencing changed from an art of war to a sport.\\"Domenico Angelo at Encyclop√¶dia Britannica.com. As fencing progressed, the combat aspect slowly faded until only the rules of the sport remained. While the fencing taught in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was intended to serve both for competition and the duel (while understanding the differences between the two situations), the type of fencing taught in a modern sport fencing salle is intended only to train the student to compete in the most effective manner within the rules of the sport. As this evolution has continued, the training and techniques have become increasingly further removed from their martial roots. One driving force behind this evolution is sport fencing's award of a point to the fencer who scores the first touch with right of way; this encourages the competitors to use scoring techniques that result in a first touch in a sporting encounter but would leave them defenseless against a counterthrust, even from a mortally wounded opponent, in a duel with lethal weapons. The development of the first touch rule itself was, in turn, driven by the increasing tendency of duels to be fought to first blood rather than the death, with the result that training for a first touch could result in victory in a duel as well as a sporting encounter, even without killing or disabling the opponent. Historical fencing Advertisement for Alfred Hutton's swordsmanship show at the Bath Club. As early as 1880, attempts were made to recreate the older German, Italian, and Spanish schools of swordsmanship. The movement was led in England by the soldier, writer, antiquarian and swordsman, Alfred Hutton. In 1862, he organized in his regiment stationed in India the Cameron Fencing Club, for which he prepared his first work, a 12-page booklet entitled Swordsmanship.Sources in the V&A; Museum's library After returning from India in 1865, Hutton focused on the study and revival of older fencing systems and schools. He began tutoring groups of students in the art of 'ancient swordplay' at a club attached to the London Rifle Brigade School of Arms in the 1880s. In 1889 Hutton published his most influential work Cold Steel: A Practical Treatise on the Sabre, which presented the historical method of military sabre use on foot, combining the 18th century English backsword with modern Italian duelling sabre. Hutton's pioneering advocacy and practice of historical fencing included reconstructions of the fencing systems of several historical masters including George Silver and Achille Marozzo. He delivered numerous practical demonstrations with his colleague Egerton Castle of these systems during the 1890s, both in order to benefit various military charities and to encourage patronage of the contemporary methods of competitive fencing. Exhibitions were held at the Bath Club and a fund-raising event was arranged at Guy's Hospital. Despite this revival, the practice died out soon after the death of Hutton in 1910. Interest in the physical application of historical fencing techniques remained largely dormant during the first half of the 20th century, and only revived near the end of the 20th century.  Classical fencing  Practitioners of modern fencing, who were unsatisfied with the exclusive sports emphasis that modern fencing had, took steps to preserve the principles of dueling and fencing as practiced in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Classical fencing uses the foil, √©p√©e, and sabre according to these older practices. Fencing and sword fighting have been incorporated into films as part of cinematic action sequences. Usually choreographed, these scenes are designed for entertainment but often demonstrate a high level of skill. Actor Errol Flynn became known for his sword-fighting scenes, such as in The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938). Other examples include The Princess Bride (1987), Rob Roy (1995), and Die Another Day (2002). Asian swordsmanship Chinese and Vietnamese A Chinese dao and scabbard of the 18th century Chinese and Vietnamese speakers make a clear distinction between a \\"sword\\" (double-edged) and a \\"knife\\" (single-edged). In Chinese and Vietnamese culture the double-edged sword or jian is considered a master's weapon or gentlemen's weapon, both from the considerable skill required to fight with this weapon and from the fact that commanders of armies favored the jian in order to move easily amongst the troops. It is described in Chinese and Vietnamese as the \\"delicate lady\\" of weapons, and is traditionally considered the weapon most suitable for women. A single edged sword is referred to as a dao. The jian and dao are among the four main weapons taught in the Chinese and Vietnamese martial arts, the others being the staff and spear. The order in which these weapons is taught may vary between schools and styles, but the jian is generally taught last among the four. Filipino bolos Swords in the Philippines come in a variety of forms but are traditionally consistent with the straight or lightly curved cutting type used by the tribes of neighbouring Borneo and Taiwan. This is preserved in the design of the kampilan and the dahong palay, though other forms also existed. They were typically paired with a rectangular shield called the kalasag. During the Battle of Mactan, Lapu- Lapu's tribe used native swords and spears to defeat Ferdinand Magellan's troops who were armed with guns and cannons. The arrival of European colonists brought the influence of western swords, which is likely the origin of the pinuti's hand-guard and sabre-like blade. When the Philippines was colonized by the Spaniards, the use of traditional swords and weapons was immediately banned. Because of this, the Filipinos were forced to use their own farm tools to fight in rebellions. And in the following insurgencies against other foreign colonists like America and Japan, they were again forced to use these improvised weapons. During the Japanese occupation, because of scarce ammunition to fight the Japanese, the Filipinos used guerrilla attacks with their melee weapons and swords in raiding Japanese camps. Filipino swordplay relies heavily on speed, and even today Filipino marines train in a form of eskrima using a curved single-edge sword. Indian Angampora exponents with swords and bucklers. Soldiers in ancient Indian subcontinent are recorded as carrying a shield and spear in their hands while a sword, dagger, and battle-axe were held at the waist. These included both straight swords and slightly curved sabres. The stout, straight sword appears to have been common and can be seen in early sculptural depictions of the epics. The hero Arjuna, for instance, is made to wield a one-handed sword with a bevelled point, a small handguard, and a large round pommel. Two-handed swords naturally had longer handles and were broad at the hilt. Curved swords are also known to have been in common use since at least the Buddhist era, including large kukri-like falchions. The most common type of curved sword is the katti, which still occurs under various names everywhere from the deep south to the far northeast. The handle, in particular, has changed over time, eventually incorporating a crossguard. The 16th-century Mughal conquests spread the talwar and similar weapons throughout the north, northwest and central regions. The talwar is still the most common form of sword in the martial arts of these areas, but the older katti is still used in some advanced forms. The earliest extant manual on ancient Indian swordsmanship is the Agni Purana, which gives 32 positions to be taken with the sword and shield. Indian swordplay is highly athletic, taking advantage of the weapon's lightweight. Techniques make extensive use of circular movements, often circling the weapon around the swordsman's head. Systems exist which focus on drawing the sword out of the opponent's body. The attacking weapon is rarely used for blocking, relying either on a shield as a parrying tool or a second sword. Dual-wielding is thus a common and valued skill in the Indian subcontinent. Sparring is done through an exercise called gatka, in which the practitioners fight with wooden sticks to simulate swords. Japanese Kendo at an agricultural school in Japan around 1920 The sword has long held a significance in Japanese culture from the reverence and care that the samurai placed in their weapons. The earliest swords in Japan were straight, based on early Chinese jian. Curved blades became more common at the end of the 8th century, with the importation of the curved forging techniques of that time. The shape was more efficient when fighting from horseback. Japanese swordsmanship is primarily two-handed wherein the front hand pushes down and the back hand pulls up while delivering a basic vertical cut. The samurai often carried two swords, the longer katana and the shorter wakizashi, and these were normally wielded individually, though use of both as a pair did occur. While earlier tachi were worn with the edge facing down, the later katana was worn with the edge facing upwards. This facilitated a quicker draw. Entire systems have been based on this technique and are known as iaido, iaijutsu, battodo or battojutsu. Because of the danger in training with real swords, practitioners since the 18th century have trained with wooden swords (bokken) or bamboo swords (shinai) while wearing body armour. After the carrying of swords in public became illegal, this resulted in the modern sport of kendo. Some ancient schools still exist along with some more modern schools. Many schools also focus almost exclusively on swordsmanship which grew from the noble families' patronage of certain teachers. Korean An excerpt from the Muyedobotongji: mounted double- sword (ÎßàÏÉÅÏåçÍ≤Ä; È¶¨‰∏äÈõôÂäç) The earliest Korean swords were straight double-edge blades derived from the Chinese jian. As Korean warfare favoured mounted combat, the curved single-edge sword was found to be more effective from horseback. Joseon's centralised government and the need to fend off frequent foreign invasions were conducive to the development of swordsmanship as a standardised military discipline. Along with other martial systems, forms of swordsmanship were formalised in the military manual Muyejebo (1610) based on Qi Jiguang's Ji Xiao Xin Shu, and in the revisions, Muyesinbo (1759) and Muyedobotongji (1790). The Muyedobotongji also describes standard lengths and weights of the swords used; while not exclusive to swordsmanship, 8 of the 23 chapters are devoted to it, reflecting the needs the era when the guns have not yet matured enough for short-range combat. Persian and Hebrew Swords in the Middle East evolved from daggers and sickles. They were originally made of copper, followed by bronze and finally iron. Among communities such as the Persians and Hebrews, the sword was short and equivalent to the Roman gladius. There did however exist longswords, slightly curved swords, and sickle-like swords similar to the Egyptian khopesh. Some blades were of such a size that it is difficult to classify them as either swords or daggers, and they are thus referred to by archaeologists as dagger-swords. Assyrian and Hittite Among the Assyrians and Hittites, the sword or namsaru was long with a slender blade. In the ancient Middle East, swords were always a secondary weapon. Assyrians made extensive use of the sword and dagger in hand-to-hand combat; the primary weapons were the bow, spear, and sling. Arabia and the Levant Prior to the founding of Islam, swords were imported from Ubulla, a town along the Tigris river in Iraq. Arabian swords retained their straight double-edge shape during the time of the Prophet Muhammed. With the exception of their curved handles, they were nearly identical to medieval European arming swords in both function and design. They typically had a cruciform hilt and favoured cut and thrust techniques. Swords of this type were often paired with a shield or buckler but could also be wielded on their own. Sword fencing and sword dances are still practiced in much of the Middle East. In countries like Oman the weapon is typically paired with a shield or sometimes a dagger, of which many varieties exist. In modern Iran, traditional Persian armed combat called razmafzar is currently being reconstructed. At present, sword training includes the single sword, two swords, and the sword with a shield. The spread of Islam was a unifying force in the Middle East, easing trade routes across the region. Armouries flourished and Damascus became the capital for trade in swords from Syria, Persia and Spain. The 9th-century Muslim scholar Al-Kindi studied the craft of forging swords and found 25 sword-making techniques peculiar to their countries of origin, including Yemen, Iran, France and Russia. Turkey The curved scimitar blade which has now come to typify Middle Eastern swords came about after the Turkish Seljuk migration from Central Asia to Anatolia, popularizing the pre-existing Byzantine sabre designs for cavalry use, which influenced the entire region. The curved blade was well-suited to the equestrian culture of the Turks. The scimitar gave primacy to hacking and slashing techniques rather than the thrust.

In 1985, the Brampton Board of Trade started planning a Santa Claus parade for 1986; simultaneously, the Jaycees were intending to start a parade in 1987. With City co-operation, the Board's parade launched in 1986, with Jaycee assistance in marshalling. That year's program was announced to include forty community entrants, sponsored by companies, but ended up with 52 units. In recent years, it has included over 100 units. The parade moved to a \\"night parade\\" format in 1995. The parade route has expanded from Vodden to south of Wellington Street (1986) to Sproule to south of Elgin Street. The parade typically happens a week before the Toronto Santa Claus Parade. The Board claims an in-person attendance of 160,000 (2012). It claims to be the largest single-day event in the Regional Municipality of Peel, and the largest night parade in Canada. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce has named the parade as the Best Community Lighted Parade in Canada. The program was broadcast on Rogers TV Brampton, which claimed viewership of over 250,000 between live and repeat broadcasts.

Styled as the Duke of Bourbon from birth, he succeeded his father as Prince of Cond√© () in 1709; however, he was still known by the ducal title. He was prince for less than a year. Biography Louis de Bourbon, duc de Bourbon, duc de Montmorency (1668‚Äì1689), duc d'Enghien (1689‚Äì1709), 6th Prince of Cond√©, comte de Sancerre (1709‚Äì1710), comte de Charolais (1709), was born at the H√¥tel de Cond√© in Paris on 10 November 1668 and died at the Palace of Versailles on 4 March 1710. The eldest son of Henri Jules de Bourbon, Prince of Cond√© and Anne Henriette of Bavaria, and the grandson of the le Grand Cond√©. One of nine children, he was his parents' eldest surviving son. His sister, Marie Th√©r√®se de Bourbon, married Fran√ßois Louis, Prince of Conti in 1688. Another sister, Louise B√©n√©dicte de Bourbon, would marry Louis Auguste, Duke of Maine, a legitimised son of Louis XIV, in 1692. His youngest sister, Marie Anne de Bourbon, much later married the famous general Louis Joseph de Bourbon. He was made a Chevalier du Saint- Esprit in 1686, a colonel of the Bourbon-Infanterie Regiment later that same year, a mar√©chal de camp in 1690, and a lieutenant general in 1692. Upon the death of his father, he inherited all the Cond√© titles and estates. Marriage In 1685, Louis married Louise Fran√ßoise de Bourbon, known at court as Mademoiselle de Nantes, who was the eldest legitimised daughter of King Louis XIV of France and his mistress, Madame de Montespan. In an age where dynastic considerations played a major role, eyebrows at court were raised at a marriage between a full-blooded prince du sang and a royal bastard. The head of the House of Cond√©, le Grand Cond√©, however, acquiesced to the socially inferior match in the hope of gaining favour with the bride's father, Louis XIV. The seventeen-year-old duc de Bourbon was known at court as Monsieur le Duc. After the marriage, his wife assumed the style of Madame la Duchesse. Like his father, who became Prince of Cond√© in 1687, Louis de Bourbon led a typical, unremarkable life. At a time when five-and-a-half feet was considered a normal height for a woman, Louis, while not quite a dwarf, was considered a short man. His sisters, in fact, were so tiny that they were referred to as \\"dolls of the Blood\\", or, less flatteringly, as \\"little black beetles\\" since many of them were dark in complexion and hunchbacked. While not suffering from this condition himself, Louis was macrocephalic. In addition, his skin tone was said to have a definite yellowish-orange tint to it. On the plus side, while no scholar, Louis was respectably well educated. Similarly, while certainly no fool, he was not burdened with too much intelligence for his time and station in life. Prince of Cond√© Arms of Louis as the Prince of Cond√© Louis was prince de Cond√© for a little less than a year, as he died only eleven months after his father. Like his father, Louis was hopelessly insane, having slipped into madness several years before his actual death, \\"making horrible faces\\", as one historian noted. Louis died in 1710 at the age of forty-two.

A member of the House of Bourbon, he held the prestigious rank of Prince du Sang.  Youth  Born on 9 August 1736 at Chantilly, Louis Joseph was the only son of Louis Henri I, Prince of Cond√© (1692‚Äì1740) and Landgravine Caroline of Hesse-Rotenburg (1714‚Äì41). As a cadet of the reigning House of Bourbon, he was a prince du sang. His father Louis Henri, was the eldest son of Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Cond√© (known as Monsieur le Duc) and his wife Louise Fran√ßoise de Bourbon, legitimated daughter of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan. During his father's lifetime, the infant Louis Joseph was known as the Duke of Enghien, (duc d'Enghien). At the age of four, following his father's death in 1740, and his mother's death in 1741, he was placed under the care of his paternal uncle, Louis, Count of Clermont, his father's youngest brother. Family Louis Joseph by Jean-Marc Nattier, c. 1755-66. Louis Joseph had an older half sister, Henriette de Bourbon, Mademoiselle de Verneuil (1725‚Äì1780). Through his mother, he was a first cousin of King Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia and of Marie Th√©r√®se of Savoy, Princess de Lamballe. His paternal cousins included Louise Henriette de Bourbon, Duchess of Orl√©ans (mother of Philippe √âgalit√©), the sister of Louis Fran√ßois de Bourbon, Prince of Conti, head of another cadet branch of the royal dynasty. Viktoria of Hesse-Rotenburg, the Princess of Soubise, was another first cousin. Louis Joseph married Charlotte de Rohan in 1753, the daughter of the French king Louis XV's friend, Charles de Rohan, Prince of Soubise. Charlotte's mother, Anne Marie Louise de La Tour d'Auvergne, was a daughter of Emmanuel Th√©odose de La Tour d'Auvergne, the reigning Duke of Bouillon. The couple were married at Versailles on 3 May 1753. Together, they had three children: a daughter, Marie de Bourbon, who died young; an only son, Louis Henri de Bourbon, who would later become the last Prince of Cond√©; and a daughter, Louise Ad√©la√Øde de Bourbon. In 1770, his son married Bathilde d'Orl√©ans, daughter of Louis Philippe I, Duke of Orl√©ans, and sister of Philippe √âgalit√©. The marriage was supposed to heal relations between the Cond√© and Orl√©ans branches of the royal family.Louis Joseph's grandmother, Mademoiselle de Nantes was the older sister of Louis Philippe's grandmother Mademoiselle de Blois, legitimated daughters of Louis XIV Louis Joseph's wife Charlotte died in 1760, and as time passed, his relationship with Maria Caterina Brignole, Princess of Monaco, became serious. Maria was the daughter of Giuseppe Brignole, Marquis of Groppoli and Maria Anna Balbi. By 1769, Maria had begun to set up a home in the H√¥tel de Lassay, an annex of the Prince of Cond√©'s primary residence, the Palais Bourbon.Braham (1980), p. 215. In 1770, her jealous husband, Honor√© III, Prince of Monaco, ordered the borders of Monaco closed in an attempt to prevent her from escaping. She managed, nonetheless, to cross into France and found her way to Le Mans, southwest of Paris, where she took refuge in a convent. Eventually, she was able to return to Paris. Due to Maria Caterina's illicit position as the Prince of Cond√©'s mistress, the new French queen, 18-year-old Marie Antoinette (wife of King Louis XVI of France), treated her poorly at court, which consequently offended Louis Joseph. In about 1774, Louis Joseph and his mistress Maria began the construction of the H√¥tel de Monaco, which was to be her permanent home in Paris. It was in the rue Saint- Dominique, near the Palais Bourbon, and was completed in 1777. Subsequently, Prince Honor√© of Monaco finally realized his relationship with Maria Caterina was completely finished and thereupon turned his attention to his own love affairs. Maria Caterina later wrote to her husband that their marriage could be summarised in three words: greed, bravery, and jealousy.  Later life  Arms of the Prince of Cond√© During both the reigns of King Louis XV and his grandson, King Louis XVI, Louis Joseph held the position of Grand Ma√Ætre de France in the King's royal household, the Maison du Roi. Obtaining the rank of general, he fought in the Seven Years' War with some distinction, serving alongside his father-in-law, the Prince of Soubise. He was also Governor of Burgundy. Furthermore, the Prince was the leader of the Cond√© army of √©migr√©s. He used her great fortune to help finance the exiled French community's resistance movement. In 1765, named the heir of his paternal aunt, √âlisabeth Alexandrine de Bourbon, Louis Joseph received generous pensions which √âlisabeth Alexandrine had in turn acquired from her cousin, Louise-Fran√ßoise de Bourbon. In that same year, Louis Joseph repurchased the Palais Bourbon, previously owned by his family, from King Louis XV, and decided to rebuild it from a country house into a monumental palace, in the new Classical Revival style. With this in mind, he purchased the neighboring H√¥tel de Lassay in 1768, planning to make the two buildings into one. However, the palace was only finished at the end of the 1780s, when the French Revolution later swept away the old regime. He then moved from the H√¥tel de Cond√©,It was at the H√¥tel de Cond√© that the Marquis de Sade was born, his mother was a lady-in-waiting to Louis Joseph's mother, Caroline where he was born, to the Palais Bourbon. The former residence was later sold to King Louis XV in 1770, becoming the subsequent site of the Od√©on Theatre. Among other estates, Louis Joseph also inherited the famous Ch√¢teau de Chantilly, the main seat of the Cond√© line. At Chantilly, the prince conducted a number of improvements and embellishments in the years before the French Revolution. He had the Ch√¢teau d'Enghien built on the grounds of the estate to house guests when the prince entertained at Chantilly. It was constructed in 1769 by the architect, Jean Fran√ßois Leroy, and was later renamed the Ch√¢teau d'Enghien in honour of his grandson, Louis Antoine de Bourbon, Duke of Enghien,The famous victim of Napoleon I of France who was born at Chantilly in 1772. He also commissioned a large garden in the English style as well as an hameau, much like the contemporary one that Queen Marie Antoinette had created at Versailles and at the Petit Trianon ch√¢teau. Louis Joseph lived with his mistress Maria in France until the French revolution, when the couple left for Germany and then Great Britain. In 1795, Prince Honor√© of Monaco died, and on 24 October 1798, the Prince of Cond√© and Maria were married in London.The Royalty, peerage and aristocracy of the world, Vol 90 The marriage was kept secret for a decade, the couple reportedly becoming openly known as husband and wife only after 26 December 1808. Exile During the French Revolution, Louis Joseph was a dedicated supporter of the monarchy and one of the principal leaders of the counter-revolutionary movement. After the storming of the Bastille in 1789, he fled France with his son and grandson, before the Reign of Terror which arrested, tried and guillotined most of the Bourbons still living in France: Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and the Duke of Orleans (Philippe √âgalit√©) were executed in 1793, and the king's sister, Madame √âlisabeth, was beheaded in 1794. Louis Joseph established himself at Coblenz in 1791, where he helped to organize and lead a large counter-revolutionary army of √©migr√©s. In addition to containing the prince's grandson, Louis-Antoine-Henri de Bourbon-Cond√©, duc d'Enghien, and the two sons of his cousin, the late king's brother, the comte d'Artois, the corps included many young aristocrats who eventually became leaders during the Bourbon Restoration years later. This group also included Armand-Emmanuel du Plessis, Duc de Richelieu, Pierre Louis Jean Casimir de Blacas and Fran√ßois- Ren√© de Chateaubriand. The Army of Cond√© initially fought in conjunction with the Austrians. Later, due to differences with the Austrian plan of attack, however, the Prince de Cond√© entered with his corps into English pay in 1795. In 1796, the army fought in Swabia. In 1797, Austria signed the Treaty of Campo Formio with the First French Republic, formally ending its hostilities against the French. With the loss of its closest allies, the army transferred into the service of the Russian tsar, Paul I and was stationed in Poland, returning in 1799 to the Rhine under Alexander Suvorov. In 1800 when Russia left the Allied coalition, the army re-entered English service and fought in Bavaria. The army was disbanded in 1801 without having achieved its principal ambition, restoring Bourbon rule in France. After the dissolution of the corps, the prince spent his exile in England, where he lived with his second wife, Maria Caterina Brignole, the divorced wife of Honor√© III, Prince of Monaco, whom he had married in 1798. She died in 1813. With the defeat of Napoleon, Louis Joseph returned to Paris, where he resumed his courtly duties as grand ma√Ætre in the royal household of Louis XVIII. He died in 1818 and was succeeded by his son, Louis Henri. His daughter, Louise Ad√©la√Øde de Bourbon, who was a nun and had become the abbess of Remiremont Abbey, survived until 1824. He was buried at the Basilica of St Denis.

Life Louis Henri was the only son of Louis Joseph, Prince of Cond√© by his first wife, Charlotte de Rohan, daughter of Charles de Rohan, Prince of Soubise. As a member of the reigning House of Bourbon, he was a prince du sang and was entitled to the style of Serene Highness, prior to his accession to the Cond√© title, while he was known as the duke of Enghien and later as Duke of Bourbon. On succeeding his father he was entitled to the style of Royal Highness. Marriage On 24 April 1770, he married Bathilde d'Orl√©ans, only surviving daughter of Louis Philippe d'Orl√©ans, Duke of Orl√©ans and Louise Henriette de Bourbon. The couple were married in the chapel at the palace of Versailles and were descended from Louis XIV to the same degree (their paternal great grandmothers were sisters, daughters of Madame de Montespan). In 1772 their only son, Louis Antoine, Duke of Enghien, was born. The marriage was not a happy one, and in 1780 the couple separated. Louis never remarried. Shortly afterwards, Louis Henri began a public affair with an opera singer, Marguerite \\"Mimi\\" Michelot, which resulted in two illegitimate daughters, one of whom, Ad√®le, went on to marry the Comte de Reuilly. During the French Revolution, Louis Henri accompanied his father into exile in England and survived the purge of the House of Bourbon in France, which cost the life of King Louis XVI and his Queen Marie-Antoinette, amongst others. In 1804, his son, the Duke of Enghien, was abducted in Germany by order of Napoleon and executed in the moat of the Ch√¢teau de Vincennes on trumped up charges of treason. The Duke of Enghien had been married to Charlotte Louise de Rohan for less than two months and had no issue. Louis Henri returned with his father to France after the defeat of Napoleon in 1814, and both recovered their fortunes and public status. On his father's death in 1818, he assumed the title of Prince de Cond√©. End of the Cond√© Portrait by Pierre Louis Delaval, Mus√©e Cond√© of Chantilly, France The line of Bourbon- Cond√© came to an end with Louis Henri II's death under suspicious circumstances in 1830, shortly after the July Revolution. While in exile in 1811, the duc de Bourbon had made the acquaintance at a bordello in Piccadilly of one Sophia Dawes or Daw, a maid in a brothel from the Isle of Wight. He set the woman and her mother up in London in a house on Gloucester Street. There, she went through an extensive educational program Finding The Prince. Gravure extraite de l'Histoire de Louis-Philippe Ier roi des Fran√ßais, 1847. After the Bourbon Restoration in 1815, Louis Henri brought her to Paris and arranged a marriage for her to Baron Adrien Victor de Feucheres, an officer in the royal guard. This was done to allow Sophia entry into French society. However, in the course of setting up her marriage license, Sophia lied on several particulars. Feucheres, who became an aide to the duke, believed for several years that Sophia was a natural daughter of Louis Henri II. When he discovered the truth, he separated from his wife, and informed King Louis XVIII of the real relationship between Louis Henri and Sophia. The king banned Sophia from court. In revenge, Sophia approached the head of the House of Orl√©ans, the Duke of Orleans and through him made a new entry into society. In return, she agreed to use her influence on the aging Louis Henri II to have him set up a will making the son of Louis Philippe, Prince Henri, Duke of Aumale, the old prince's main heir. Sophia was given two million francs for her services in the matter. The new Bourbon king, Charles X, eventually accepted her back at court. She was again considered acceptable by polite French society. She was even able to arrange the marriage of a niece to a nephew of Talleyrand. By now, Louis Henri was trying to get away from the mistress who had taken over his life. In the summer of 1830, he returned to his home at St. Leu. There, he heard of the July Revolution. Sophia immediately set about to get him to recognize the new Orl√©ans monarchy. When on 27 August 1830 he was found dead with a rope around his neck but his feet on the ground. The baroness was suspected and an inquiry was held which formally declared the death to be a suicide. There were rumours that the new King of the French, Louis-Philippe, had collaborated with Sophie in the crime as they feared that she and Louis Phillippe's son Aumale - the testamentary heirs of Cond√© - might be disinherited by the Prince after a possible flight abroad. Later, rumours circulated amongst the nobility that Cond√© had died pleasuring himself, engaged in what would later be known as autoerotic asphyxiation. With the evidence of death being the result of any crime appearing insufficient, the baroness was not prosecuted, although she was involved in litigation regarding the inheritance for years to come.see for instance Diekstra, Ren√©, De macht van een ma√Ætresse, Karakter Uitgevers BV, Uithoorn, 2011, 431 p There are some aspects of the relationship between Sophia and the prince that William Thackeray may have had in mind in the novel Vanity Fair regarding Becky Sharp possibly killing Joseph Sedley. The prince's lands and wealth passed to his godson, the Duke of Aumale.

Early life John Badham was born in Luton, Bedfordshire, United Kingdom, the son of U.S. Army General Henry Lee Badham, Jr., and English-born actress Mary Iola Badham (n√©e Hewitt). Henry, a native of Birmingham, Alabama, moved his family back to the U.S. when John was two years old. John's parents and paternal grandparents are buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Birmingham. Henry was an aviator in both World Wars, and was posthumously inducted into the Alabama Aviation Hall of Fame in 2007. After retirement from the U.S. Air Force as a brigadier general, Henry became a businessman and helped develop the Ensley and Bessemer regions near Birmingham, Alabama. This same line of business had brought his own father, John's grandfather, into association with Walker Percy, grandfather of writer Walker Percy.Badham, Jr., H. L., comp. History of the Bessemer Coal, Iron, and Land Company. Bessemer: N.p., 1948 After World War II, Badham's family settled in Mountain Brook, an affluent suburb of Birmingham. He attended Indian Springs School, at that time a brand-new, liberal boy's school located a short distance south of Birmingham in Shelby County near the rural post office of Helena. He later went to college at Yale University. Career Badham worked in television for years, before his breakthrough in 1977 with Saturday Night Fever, a massive worldwide hit starring John Travolta. WarGames (1983), starring Matthew Broderick, is his other signature film, renowned for its take on popular Cold War fears of nuclear terror as well as being one of the first films to deal with the subculture of amateur hacking. In addition to his numerous film credits, Badham has also directed and produced for TV, including credits for Rod Serling's Night Gallery, and the A&E; television series The Beast. He has also contributed commentary to the web series Trailers from Hell. Unrealized projects Badham has been considered to direct films that ended up being helmed by other directors, such as The Wiz (1978), The Dead Zone (1983) and Ghost Dad (1990). Family Badham's sister, Mary Badham, was nominated for an Oscar for her role as \\"Scout\\" Finch in the film To Kill a Mockingbird.

His father was Samuel Winston. https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Winston-576 In his youth, he fought with the Virginia militia against border Indians in 1763 before moving to the Province of North Carolina in the late 1760s.

Walker was known for his baritone voice and an unorthodox career path which took him from 1960s teen pop icon to 21st-century avant-garde musician. Walker's success was largely in the United Kingdom, where his first four solo albums reached the top ten. He lived in the UK from 1965 and became a UK citizen in 1970. Rising to fame in the mid-1960s as frontman of the pop music trio the Walker Brothers, he began a solo career with 1967's Scott, moving toward an increasingly challenging style on late-1960s baroque pop albums such as Scott 3 and Scott 4 (both 1969). After sales of his solo work started to decrease, he reunited with the Walker Brothers in the mid-1970s. From the mid-1980s onward, Walker revived his solo career while moving in an increasingly avant- garde direction; of this period in his career, The Guardian said \\"imagine Andy Williams reinventing himself as Stockhausen\\". Walker's 1960s recordings were highly regarded by the 1980s UK underground music scene, and gained a cult following. Walker continued to record until 2018. He was described by the BBC upon his death as \\"one of the most enigmatic and influential figures in rock history\\". Life and career Early life Noel Scott Engel was born on January 9, 1943, in Hamilton, Ohio, US,Interview in Beat-Club, Radio Bremen, April 26, 1969. the son of Elizabeth Marie (Fortier), who was from Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and Noel Walter Engel. His father was an oil industry manager whose work led the family to successive homes in Ohio, Texas, Colorado and New York. Engel and his mother settled in California in 1959. Engel was interested in both music and performance and spent time as a child actor and singer in the mid to late 1950s, including roles in two Broadway musicals, Pipe Dream and Plain and Fancy. Championed by singer and TV host Eddie Fisher, he appeared several times on Fisher's TV program. Engel cut some records including one named \\"Misery\\", which saw him briefly promoted as a teen idol. Upon his arrival in Los Angeles, Engel had already changed both his taste and his direction. Interested in the progressive jazz of Stan Kenton and Bill Evans, he was also a self-confessed \\"Continental suit-wearing natural enemy of the Californian surfer\\" and a fan of European cinema (in particular Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini and Robert Bresson) and the Beat poets. In between attending art school and furthering his interests in cinema and literature, Scott played bass guitar proficiently enough to get session work in Los Angeles as a teenager. In 1961, after playing with the Routers, he met guitarist and singer John Maus, who was using the stage name John Walker on a fake ID to enable him to perform in clubs while under age. The two formed a band, Judy and the Gents, to back John Walker's sister Judy Maus, before joining other musicians to tour as the Surfaris (although they did not play on the Surfaris' records). In early 1964, Engel and John Walker began working together as the Walker Brothers, later in the year linking up with drummer Gary Leeds whose father financed the trio's first trip to the UK. 1964‚Äì1967: The Walker Brothers As a trio, the Walker Brothers cultivated a glossy-haired and handsome familial image. Prompted by Maus, each of the members took \\"Walker\\" as their stage surname. Scott continued to use the name Walker thereafter, with the brief exception of returning to his birth name for the original release of his fifth solo album Scott 4, and in songwriting credits. Initially, John served as guitarist and main lead singer of the trio, with Gary on drums and Scott playing bass guitar and mostly singing harmony vocals. By early 1965, the group had made appearances on TV shows Hollywood A Go-Go and Shindig and had made initial recordings, but the start of their real success lay in the future and overseas. While working as a session drummer, Leeds had recently toured the United Kingdom with P.J. Proby, and persuaded both John and Scott to try their luck with him on the British pop scene. The Walker Brothers arrived in London in early 1965. Their first single, \\"Pretty Girls Everywhere\\" (with John still installed as lead singer) crept into the charts but did not place highly. Their next single, \\"Love Her\\" ‚Äì with Scott's deeper baritone in the lead ‚Äì was a more substantial chart hit and he became the group's frontman. The Walker Brothers' next release, \\"Make It Easy on Yourself\\", a Bacharach/David ballad, went to No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart (number 16 on the U.S. charts) on release in August 1965. After hitting again with \\"My Ship Is Coming In\\" (number 3 UK), their second No. 1 (number 13 U.S.), \\"The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Any More\\", shot to the top in early 1966; shortly thereafter their fan club grew to contain more members than the official fan club of the Beatles, though this is no indication that the Walker Brothers' actual fan base was ever larger. In any case, the Walker Brothers, especially lead singer Scott, attained pop star status. Finding suitable material was always a problem. The Walkers' 1960s sound mixes Phil Spector's \\"wall of sound\\" techniques with symphonic orchestrations featuring Britain's top musicians and arrangers, notably Ivor Raymonde. Scott served as effective co-producer of the band's records throughout this period (alongside their named producer, Johnny Franz and engineer Peter Oliff), later described as a \\"parallel, if invisible Walker Brothers.\\" Many of their earlier numbers had a driving beat, but by Images, their third album, ballads predominated. By the time of Images, John Walker's musical influence on the Walker Brothers had waned (although he sang lead on a cover of \\"Blueberry Hill\\" and contributed two original compositions) and this led to tensions between him and Scott. For his part, Scott was finding the group a chafing experience ‚Äì \\"There was a lot of pressure. I was coming up with all the material for the boys, and I was having to find songs and getting the sessions together. Everyone relied on me, and it just got on top of me. I think I just got irritated with it all.\\" Artistic differences and the stresses stemming from overwhelming pop stardom led to the break-up of the Walker Brothers in 1967, although they reunited briefly for a tour of Japan the following year. 1967‚Äì1974: Solo work For his solo career, Walker shed the Walker Brothers' mantle and worked in a style clearly glimpsed on Images. Initially, this led to a continuation of his previous band's success. Walker's first four albums, titled Scott (1967), Scott 2 (1968), Scott 3 (1969), and Scott: Scott Walker Sings Songs from his TV Series (1969), all sold in large numbers, with Scott 2 topping the British charts. During this period, Walker combined his earlier teen appeal with a darker, more idiosyncratic approach (which had been hinted at in songs like \\"Orpheus\\" on the Images album). While his vocal style remained consistent with Walker Brothers, he now drove a fine line between classic ballads, Broadway hits and his own compositions, and also included risqu√© recordings of Jacques Brel songs (translated by Mort Shuman, who was also responsible for the hit musical Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris). Walker's own original songs of this period were influenced by Brel and L√©o Ferr√©Young, Rob (2013). Scott: The Collection 1967‚Äì1970, Universal. as he explored European musical roots while expressing his own American experience and reaching a new maturity as a recording artist. Walker continued to grow as a producer. In 1968 (during the brief Walker Brothers reunion and tour of Japan), he produced a single with the Japanese rock group the Carnabeats, featuring Gary Walker on vocals. Upon his return to the UK, he produced a solo album for the Walker Brothers' musical director and guitarist Terry Smith. In 1968, Walker also produced Ray Warleigh's First Album. According to Anthony Reynolds, \\"[Warleigh's] album, recorded on December 13 and released in the following year, had little in common with the more esoteric progressive jazz that Scott was digging at the time, and the result veered more toward pleasantly middle- of-the-road muzak than the jazz fusion just around the corner.\\" In 1968, Scott Walker also produced John Maus's solo single \\"Woman\\". Walker's own relationship with fame, and the concentrated attention which it brought to him, remained a problem as regards his emotional well-being. He became reclusive and somewhat distanced from his audience. In 1968 he threw himself into an intense study of contemporary and classical music, which included a sojourn in Quarr Abbey, a Catholic Benedictine monastery in Ryde on the Isle of Wight, to study Gregorian chant, building on an interest in lieder and classical musical modes. At the peak of his fame in 1969, Walker was given his own BBC TV series, Scott, featuring solo Walker performances of ballads, big band standards, Brel songs and his own compositions. Footage of the show is currently very rare as recordings were not archived. In later interviews Walker has suggested that by the time of his third solo LP, a self-indulgent complacency had crept into his choice of material. His fourth solo album ‚Äì Scott: Scott Walker Sings Songs from his TV Series ‚Äì exemplified the problems he was having in failing to balance his own creative work with the demands of the entertainment industry and of his manager Maurice King, who seemed determined to mold his proteg√© into a new Andy Williams or Frank Sinatra. Despite the failure of the Scott TV show, the aforementioned companion LP Scott: Scott Walker Sings Songs from his TV Series was a commercial success, reaching the top 10 of the UK Albums Chart - Walker's last album to do so. Having parted company with King, Walker released his fifth solo LP ‚Äì Scott 4 ‚Äì in 1969. Compensating for his recent dip into passivity, this was his first record to be made up entirely of self-penned material: the 'standards' and Brel covers were gone. The album failed to chart and was deleted soon after. It has been speculated that Walker's decision to release the album under his birth name of Scott Engel contributed to its chart failure. All subsequent re- issues of the album have been released under his stage name. Walker then entered a period of self-confessed artistic decline, during which he spent five years making records \\"by rote, just to get out of contract\\" and consoling himself with drink. His next album, 'Til the Band Comes In (1970), showed a pronounced split between its two sides. Side A featured original material (mostly co-written with Ady Semel) while side B consisted almost entirely of cover versions. Subsequent releases saw Walker revert to cover versions of popular film tunes and a serious flirtation with country music. The Moviegoer (1972), Any Day Now (1973), Stretch (1973), and We Had It All (1974) feature no original material whatsoever. In the 2006 documentary Scott Walker: 30 Century Man, Walker describes these as his \\"lost years\\" in terms of creativity. He has also confessed to having surrendered his direction due to outside pressure:  1975‚Äì1978: The Walker Brothers reunite  The Walker Brothers reunited in 1975 to produce three albums. Their first single, a cover of Tom Rush's song \\"No Regrets\\", from the album of the same title reached number 7 in the UK Singles Chart. However, the parent album peaked at only number 49 in the UK Albums Chart. The two singles from the next album Lines (its title track, which Scott regarded as the best single the group ever released, and \\"We're All Alone\\") both failed to chart, and the album fared no better. With the imminent demise of their record label, the Walkers collaborated on an album of original material that was in stark contrast to the country-flavoured tunes of the previous 1970s albums. The resulting album, Nite Flights, was released in 1978 with each of the Brothers writing and singing their own compositions. The opening four songs were Scott's, the final four John's, while the middle pair were by Gary. Scott's four songs ‚Äì \\"Nite Flights\\", \\"The Electrician\\", \\"Shut Out\\", and \\"Fat Mama Kick\\" ‚Äì were his first original compositions since 'Til the Band Comes In and represented his first steps away from the MOR image and sound he had cultivated since the commercial failure of Scott 4. The extremely dark and discomforting sound of Scott's songs, particularly \\"The Electrician\\", was to prove a forerunner to the direction of his future solo work. In spite of a warm critical reception (with his contributions particularly lauded), sales figures for Nite Flights were ultimately as poor as those of Lines. The supporting tour saw the band concentrating on the old hits and ballads and ignoring the songs from their new record. Apparently now fated for a stagnant career on the revival circuit, the Walker Brothers lost heart and interest, compounded by Scott's increasing reluctance to sing live. By the end of 1978, now without a record deal, the group drifted apart again and Scott Walker entered a three-year period of obscurity and no releases. 1981‚Äì1995: A new solo voice (Climate of Hunter and Tilt) In 1981, interest in Scott Walker's work was stimulated by the compilation Fire Escape in the Sky: The Godlike Genius of Scott Walker, containing tracks selected by Julian Cope, which reached number 14 on the UK Independent Chart. Building on the critical and sales momentum of the compilation, Walker subsequently signed with Virgin Records. In 1984, Scott Walker released his first solo album in ten years, Climate of Hunter. The album furthered the complex and unnerving approach Walker had established on Nite Flights. While based loosely within the field of 1980s rock music (and featuring guest appearances by contemporary stars Billy Ocean and Mark Knopfler), it had a fragmented and trance-like approach. Many of its eight songs lacked either titles or easily identifiable melody, with only Walker's sonorous voice as the link to previous work. Like Nite Flights before it, Climate of Hunter was met with critical praise but low sales. Plans to tour were made but never came to fruition. A second album for Virgin was rumoured to be in the works (with Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois producing) but was abandoned after early sessions. Soon afterwards, Walker was dropped by the label. Walker spent the late 1980s away from music, with only a brief cameo appearance in a 1987 Britvic TV advert (alongside other 1960s pop icons) to maintain his profile. He did not return to public attention until the early 1990s when his solo and Walker Brothers work was critically reappraised again. During this period Walker's first four studio albums were issued on CD for the first time and the compilation album No Regrets ‚Äì The Best of Scott Walker and The Walker Brothers 1965‚Äì1976 hit number 4 on the UK Albums Chart. Walker's own return to current active work was gradual and cautious. In 1992 he co- wrote and co-performed (with Goran Bregoviƒá) the single \\"Man From Reno\\" for the soundtrack of the film Toxic Affair. Having signed to Fontana Records, he began work on a new album. In the meantime David Bowie covered Scott's song \\"Nite Flights\\" on his Black Tie White Noise album, which also contained the Walker inspired 'You've Been Around'. Tilt was released in 1995, developing and expanding the working methods explored on Climate of Hunter. Variously described as \\"an anti-matter collision of rock and modern classical music\\", as \\"Samuel Beckett at La Scala\\" and as \\"indescribably barren and unutterably bleak... the wind that buffets the gothic cathedrals of everyone's favorite nightmares\\", it was more consciously avant-garde than its predecessor with Walker now revealed as a fully-fledged modernist composer. Although Walker was backed by a full orchestra again, this time he was also accompanied by alarming percussion and industrial effects; and while album opener \\"Farmer in the City\\" was a melodic piece on which Walker exercised his familiar ballad voice, the remaining pieces were harsh and demandingly avant-garde. Lyrically, subject matter included the life and murder of Pier Paolo Pasolini (and his relationship with Ninetto Davoli), cockfighting, the First Gulf War, a conflation of the trials of Adolf Eichmann and Caroline of Brunswick, and a man talking to the corpse of Che Guevara. 1996‚Äì2005: Interim work (guest appearances, songs for others, Pola X) In 1996, Walker recorded the Bob Dylan song \\"I Threw It All Away\\" under the direction of Nick Cave for inclusion in the soundtrack for the film To Have and to Hold. In 1998, in a rare return to straightforward balladeering, he recorded the David Arnold song \\"Only Myself to Blame\\" (for the soundtrack of the Bond film The World Is Not Enough) and also wrote and produced the soundtrack for the L√©os Carax film Pola X, which was released as an album. In 1999, he wrote and produced two songs for Ute Lemper on her album Punishing Kiss, credited as N.S. Engel. (One of these, Lullaby, is only available as a bonus track on the Japanese version of the CD.) In 2000, Walker curated the London South Bank Centre's annual summer live music festival, Meltdown, which has a tradition of celebrity curators. He did not perform at Meltdown himself, but wrote the music for the Richard Alston Dance Project item Thimblerigging. The following year he served as producer on Pulp's 2001 album We Love Life (whose track \\"Bad Cover Version\\" includes a mocking reference to the poor quality of \\"the second side of 'Til The Band Comes In\\"). In October 2003, Walker was given an award for his contribution to music by Q magazine, presented by Jarvis Cocker of Pulp. Walker received a standing ovation at the presentation. This award had been presented only twice before, the first time to Phil Spector, and the second to Brian Eno. The release of a retrospective box set, 5 Easy Pieces, comprising five themed discs spanning Walker's work with the Walker Brothers, his solo career (including film soundtrack work), and the two pieces composed for Ute Lemper, followed soon after. The British independent label 4AD Records signed Walker in early 2004. 2006‚Äì2019: The Drift, Bish Bosch, Soused, and others On May 8, 2006, Scott Walker released The Drift, his first new album in 11 years. Critical acclaim for the album garnered a Metacritic score of 85. In both composition and atmosphere, The Drift was a continuation of the surreal, menacing, partially abstract approach displayed on Climate of Hunter and Tilt. It featured jarring contrasts between loud and quiet sections; instrumentation was similar to Tilt in the use of rock instruments and a large orchestra, but the album also interpolated unnerving sound effects such as the distressed braying of a donkey, a demoniac Donald Duck impression, and (during a recording sequence captured on film) an orchestral percussionist punching a large cut of raw meat. Lyrical subjects included torture, disease, the relationship and eventual shared death of Mussolini and his mistress Clara Petacci, and a conflation of the 9/11 attacks with a nightmare shared by Elvis Presley and his dead twin brother Jesse. In contemporary interviews, Walker appeared more at ease with media attention, revealing a wish to produce albums more frequently and hinting at significant changes in the nature of his own material if and when it suits him. Although he mentioned the possibility of touring again with a compact, five-piece band in an interview with The Wire this never transpired. In June 2006, Mojo and radio honored Scott Walker with the MOJO Icon Award: \\"Voted for by Mojo readers and Mojo4music users, the recipient of this award has enjoyed a spectacular career on a global scale\\". It was presented by Phil Alexander. A documentary film, Scott Walker: 30 Century Man, was completed in 2006 by New York film director Stephen Kijak (Cinemania and Never Met Picasso). Interviews were recorded with David Bowie (executive producer of the film), Radiohead, Sting, Gavin Friday and many musicians associated with Walker over the years. The World Premiere of Scott Walker: 30 Century Man took place as part of the 50th London Film Festival. When The Independent released its list of \\"Ten must-see films\\" at the 50th London Film Festival, Scott Walker: 30 Century Man, was among them. A documentary on Walker containing a substantial amount of footage from the film was shown on BBC1 in May 2007 as part of the Imagine... strand, presented by Alan Yentob. Walker released \\"Darkness\\" as part of Plague Songs, an album of songs for the Margate Exodus project, a re-telling of the Book of Exodus, the story of Moses and his search for the Promised Land. Ten singer-songwriters were commissioned by Artangel to write and record a song inspired by one of the ten biblical plagues. Walker's evocation of \\"Darkness\\" appears as the ninth. On September 24, 2007, Walker released And Who Shall Go to the Ball? And What Shall Go to the Ball? as a limited, never-to-be-re-pressed edition. The 24-minute instrumental work was performed by the London Sinfonietta with solo cellist Philip Sheppard as music to a performance by London-based CandoCo Dance Company. The recording is currently unavailable. From November 13 to 15, 2008, Drifting and Tilting: The Songs of Scott Walker was staged at The Barbican, in London. It comprised eight songs, two from Tilt ‚Äì \\"Farmer in the City\\" and \\"Patriot (a single)\\" ‚Äì and the rest from The Drift: \\"Cossacks Are\\", \\"Jesse\\", \\"Clara (Benito's Dream)\\", \\"Buzzers\\", \\"Jolson and Jones\\" and \\"Cue\\". Each song was presented in a music-theatre manner, with the vocal parts taken by a number of singers, including Jarvis Cocker, Damon Albarn and Dot Allison. Walker collaborated with Bat for Lashes on the song \\"The Big Sleep\\" from her 2009 album Two Suns. He wrote the score for the ROH2 production of Jean Cocteau's 1932 play Duet for One, which was staged in the Linbury Studio in June 2011. Walker's final solo album, Bish Bosch, was released on December 3, 2012 and was received with wide critical acclaim. In 2014, Walker collaborated with the experimental drone metal duo Sunn O))) on Soused, which was released on October 21, 2014. In 2015, Walker composed the score for Brady Corbet's film The Childhood of a Leader; this was followed in 2018 by the score for Corbet's film Vox Lux, also featuring music by Australian singer-songwriter Sia. Collaborations As a record producer and guest performer, Walker worked with a number of artists and bands, including Pulp, Ute Lemper, Sunn O))), and Bat for Lashes. Death Walker died at the age of 76 in London on March 22, 2019. His record label 4AD announced cancer as the cause of death. His death was announced three days later by his record company, which called him \\"a unique and challenging titan at the forefront of British music\\". \\"Scott Walker (1943-2019)\\", 4AD, 25 March 2019.

Retrieved March 25, 2019 He is survived by his girlfriend Beverly Foster, his daughter Lee and granddaughter Emmi-Lee.The Guardian, March 25, 2019 Artistry and compositional approach Initially working as an interpreter of other people's songs, Scott Walker had developed his own songwriting skills by the heyday of the Walker Brothers and by the time of his first solo album in 1967. In a 1984 interview he spoke of difficulty in writing songs: \\"I don't write songs for pleasure. I can only write when I have to ‚Äì like I'm under contract, or to finish an album.\\" Walker's late 1960s and 1970s work was relatively conventional. On a superficial level, it followed the melodic orchestral pop template used by singers such as Frank Sinatra, Andy Williams and Jack Jones ‚Äì mainstream artists whose career path he was initially expected to follow. Crucial differences came via the more avant-garde orchestrations of his arrangers (primarily Angela Morley, Peter Knight and Reg Guest) and by Walker's own approach to lyrics, which involved a cinematic mise-en-scene approach once described as \\"unsettling short stories, all the more creepy for their delicate orchestral backdrop.\\" As his solo career progressed, Walker began working political themes into his lyrics. Among the first of these was \\"The Old Man's Back Again (Dedicated to the Neo-Stalinist Regime)\\" (from Scott 4). Further references came via his dramatisation of the work of a CIA torturer on \\"The Electrician\\" (Nite Flights). Walker's next artistic development as a songwriter came when he jettisoned his remaining conventional lyrical concerns along with his remaining connections to formal popular song (and, by extension, the easy-listening ballads which he had been famous for). The New York Times described Walker as arriving at \\"the point where he barely needs melody anymore. Instead, there are whirring synthesizers, great orchestral blocks of sound, noises of unknown provenance.\\" Despite the radical alteration of his methods, Walker commented that he did not consider himself a \\"composer\\" in the established sense of the term: \\"I think of myself as a songwriter, but I agree they are maybe not traditional songs. I know what people mean, but what else can you call them?\\" Walker described his lyrical technique (assembling short blocks of text containing images that are sometimes seemingly unconnected and disparate from each other) as being similar to \\"a general, assembling troops on the battlefield.\\" The Wire has noted that the short blocks of white-on-black text presented in the CD insert for The Drift is reflective of this. The roots of this compositional technique are apparent as early as the Scott Walker tracks on Nite Flights ‚Äì the lyrics insert for the album clearly feature the technique, albeit with a black text on a white background. Walker has stated in the documentary film Scott Walker: 30 Century Man and in numerous interviews that for his entire career he has not listened to any of his own work after completion, either due to exhaustion from the project or self-criticism. Legacy Many artists have expressed their admiration for Walker or cited him as an influence, including David Bowie, Alex Turner, Marc Almond, Goldfrapp, Neil Hannon of The Divine Comedy, Julian Cope (who compiled the Fire Escape in the Sky: The Godlike Genius of Scott Walker compilation in 1981), Jarvis Cocker, Anohni, Thom Yorke and Radiohead, Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree, and Mikael √Ökerfeldt of Opeth (particularly expressed in their joint project Storm Corrosion), Tim Bowness of No-Man, Leonard Cohen, Efterklang, East India Youth, Kevin Hufnagel, Ihsahn, Russell Mills, Dennis Rea, John Baizley of Baroness, and Brian Eno.

While not a church or denomination, Dream for Africa is focusing on mobilising volunteers from various nations to partner with the people of Africa in achieving enduring breakthroughs related to hunger and food security, orphans and vulnerable children, poverty alleviation through skill enhancement and job creation, and AIDS prevention and care. The Never Ending Gardens programme makes use of small backyard gardens, allowing for extensive ownership and involvement from the local community, and integrates support programmes to ensure sustainability. The objectives of the programme include hunger alleviation, provision of a nutritional balanced diet, restoration of dignity and respect within the family unit, and general and individual improvement of quality and quantity of life. The Never Ending Gardens initiative is unlike most food initiatives in that it is not grain-focused, but rather provides vegetables known for their properties of improving the immune-system. The types of vegetables planted were selected in conjunction with the World Health Organization, National Cancer Institute, Micronutrient Initiative, CDC, agricultural agencies and UNAIDS recommendations. 1st NEG 2004 23 April - 2 May Swaziland Dream for Africa Team Benefit to readers Swaziland was chosen to be the first implementation of the Never Ending Gardens project owing to its favourable proximity to the organisation‚Äôs South African headquarters, its manageable size in terms of population and geographical expanse, available water supply, and the high degree of poverty and HIV/AIDS infection rate. Additionally, while unable to contribute funds to the project, Swazi officials were open to DFA entering the country and implementing the programme. Phase one of the three-phase programme ran through the week of April 25‚Äì30, 2004, and involved the planting of 12,874 ‚Äòsimple gardens‚Äô in 35 locations in the Mafutseni, Ntondozi, Ludzeludze and Mbangave localities. The project implementation team consisted of 122 volunteers from the United States and South Africa who moved through the localities, educating and planting a variety of seedlings. The achievements of the group were substantial: 309,000 seedlings were purchased and planted including cabbage, spinach, onions and green peppers. In the seasons to follow, a far wider selection of vegetables will be introduced and rotated. It is estimated that these gardens will supply immune system-boosting vegetables for over 50,000 individuals. As is well documented, the immune systems of most Africans are very poor, which substantially contributes to the infection rate and the rate of HIV/AIDS deaths. The first phase showed that more than 85% of all homes did not have any garden of any type in the areas visited. The 70,000 gardens, which the completed initiative is expected to produce, will supply approximately 840,000 vegetables in the first year with 1,728,000 in the second. With an average of 8 people per household, each household would be able to harvest at least 2.5 vegetables a week growing to 5 vegetables per week in the second year. During 2004, gardens were planted in three countries: * Swaziland - 20,000 gardens * Botswana - 20,000 gardens * South Africa - 60,000 gardens * Lesotho - Planned NEG * 2005: Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia, Malawi and Ghana * 2006: Mozambique, Angola, Zimbabwe and Madagascar * 2007: Democratic Republic of the Congo, Congo, Central African Republic, Burundi and Rwanda See also *Bruce Wilkinson References External links *Dream for Africa Foreign charities operating in South Africa Organisations based in Johannesburg Charities based in Georgia (U.S. state) ","title":"Never Ending Gardens"},{"id":"703508","text":"John Edward McLaughlin (born June 15, 1942) is the former Deputy Director of Central Intelligence and former Acting Director of Central Intelligence. He currently serves as a Senior Fellow and Distinguished Practitioner-in- Residence at the Philip Merrill Center for Strategic Studies at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) of the Johns Hopkins University. Life and career McLaughlin was born in McKeesport, Pennsylvania. In 1964, McLaughlin received a bachelor of arts degree from Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio. He was a member of the Beta Iota chapter of Delta Sigma Phi. He completed graduate work in comparative politics at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1966 he earned a master of arts degree in international relations from the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) of the Johns Hopkins University. After graduating from SAIS, he served as a U.S. Army officer from 1966 to 1969, completing a tour in Vietnam from 1968 to 1969. In 2001, he returned to Wittenberg to speak at the commencement ceremony. McLaughlin's CIA career lasted more than 30 years, starting in 1972 with a focus on European, Russian, and Eurasian issues at the Directorate of Intelligence. From 1984 to 1985, he served a rotational tour at the State Department in the Bureau of European and Canadian Affairs. He returned to CIA and served as Deputy Director and Director of the Office of European Analysis from 1985 to 1989; Director of Slavic and Eurasian Analysis from 1989 to 1995; Deputy Director for Intelligence, Vice Chairman for Estimates of the National Intelligence Council, and Acting Chairman of the National Intelligence Council from 1995 to 1997; and Deputy Director for Intelligence from 1997 to 2000. While Deputy Director for Intelligence from 1997 to 2000, he created the Senior Analytic Service, a career track that enables CIA analysts to rise to senior rank without working in management. He also founded the Sherman Kent School for Intelligence Analysis, an institution dedicated to teaching the history, mission, and skills of the analytic profession to new CIA employees. President Bill Clinton designated McLaughlin as the Acting Deputy Director of Central Intelligence on June 28, 2000 and later nominated him for the position. McLaughlin was unanimously confirmed as the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence by the Senate on October 18, 2000. Director of Central Intelligence George J. Tenet swore in McLaughlin as the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence on October 19, 2000. After Tenet's resignation on June 3, 2004, the Bush Administration announced that McLaughlin would serve as Acting Director after Tenet's departure on July 11, 2004. McLaughlin himself stepped down as Acting Director on September 24, 2004, after Porter J. Goss was confirmed by the Senate to serve as the new director. He then returned to his position as Deputy Director, and announced his retirement on November 12, 2004. McLaughlin currently serves as a Senior Fellow and Distinguished Practitioner-in-Residence at the Philip Merrill Center for Strategic Studies at the Johns Hopkins University Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) in Washington, D.C. He also serves on the Guiding Coalition of the Project on National Security Reform. On January 8, 2010, Director of National Intelligence Dennis C. Blair announced that he had appointed McLaughlin to head a group of experts to investigate the December 2009 bombing attempt by alleged terrorist Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab aboard Northwest Airlines Flight 253, and the November 2009 Fort Hood shooting, carried out by Army Maj. Nidal Hasan. The group was tasked with making proposals to remedy weaknesses in intelligence systems and procedures that the incidents exposed.

The Antimins (from the Greek , Antimension: \\"instead of the table\\"), is one of the most important furnishings of the altar in many Eastern Christian liturgical traditions. It is a rectangular piece of cloth of either linen or silk, typically decorated with representations of the Descent of Christ from the Cross, the Four Evangelists, and inscriptions related to the Passion. A small relic of a martyr is sewn into it. It is not permitted to celebrate the Eucharist without an antimins. The antimins is kept in the centre of the Holy Table (altar) and is unfolded only during the Divine Liturgy, before the Anaphora. At the end of the Liturgy, the antimins is folded in thirds, and then in thirds again, so that when it is unfolded the creases form a cross (see photo, right). When folded, the antimins sits in the centre of another, slightly larger cloth called the eileton (Greek: ; Slavonic: Ilit√≥n)--similar to the Western corporal, except it is usually red in colour--which is then folded around it in the same manner (3 x 3), encasing it completely. A flattened natural sponge is also kept inside the antimins, which is used to collect any crumbs which might fall onto the Holy Table. When the antimins and eileton are folded, the Gospel Book is laid on top of them. The antimins must be consecrated and signed by a bishop. The antimins, together with the chrism remain the property of the bishop, and are the means by which a bishop indicates his permission for the Holy Mysteries (Sacraments) to be celebrated in his absence. It is, in effect, a church's licence to hold divine services; were a bishop to withdraw his permission to serve the Mysteries, he would do so by taking the antimins and chrism back. Whenever a bishop visits a church or monastery under his jurisdiction, he will enter the altar (sanctuary) and inspect the antimins to be sure that it has been properly cared for, and that it is in fact the one that he issued. Besides the bishop, no one is allowed to touch an antimins except a priest or deacon, and because it is a consecrated object, they should be vested when they do so--the deacon should be fully vested, and the priest should vest in at least the epitrachil (stole) and epimanikia (cuffs). A bishop commencing consecration of an antimension. The relics are lying on the unconsecrated antimension on the holy table. The antimins may also function as a substitute altar, in that a priest may celebrate the Eucharist on it in the absence of a properly consecrated altar. In emergencies, war and persecution, the antimins thus serves a very important pastoral need. Formerly if the priest celebrated at a consecrated altar, the sacred elements were placed only on the eileton, but in current practice the priest always uses the antimins even on a consecrated altar that has relics sealed in it. At the Divine Liturgy, during the Ektenias (Litanies) that precede the Great Entrance, the eileton is opened fully and the antimins is opened two-thirds of the way, leaving the top portion folded. Then, during the Ektenia of the Catechumens, when the deacon says, \\"That He (God) may reveal unto them (the catechumens) the Gospel of righteousness,\\" the priest unfolds the last portion of the antimins, revealing the mystery of Christ's death and resurrection. After the Entrance, the chalice and diskos are placed on the antimins and the Gifts (bread and wine) are consecrated. The antimins remains unfolded until after all have received Holy Communion and the chalice and diskos are taken back to the Prothesis (Table of Oblation). The deacon (or, if there is no deacon, the priest) must very carefully inspect the antimins to be sure there are no crumbs left on it, and then it is folded up, the eileton is folded, and the Gospel Book placed on top of it. Oriental Orthodox Practice A wooden tablet, the ≈£abl√Ætho, is the liturgical equivalent of the antimins in the churches of Syriac tradition. However, it is no longer used by the Antiochian Orthodox Church (which follows the liturgical practice of Constantinople, and thus uses the antimins) or the Assyrian Church of the East and Chaldean Catholic Church. In the Ethiopian Tawahedo Church, the t√¢bot is functionally similar to the tablitho. However, this word is also used in the Ge'ez language to describe the Ark of the Covenant. The Ark is symbolically represented by the manbara t√¢b√¥t ('throne of the Ark'), a casket that sits on the altar. In the Coptic Orthodox church, a wooden tablet, the maqta‚Äò or al-lawh al- muqaddas, is the liturgical equivalent of the antimins in contemporary usage. Usually it is decorated with a cross and bears letters in Coptic which signify \\"Jesus Christ Son of God\\" in the four squares between the arms of the cross. The Armenian Orthodox tradition also has the antimins, known as gorbura.

Hall had previously served in both chambers of the Ohio General Assembly. From 2002 to 2006, Hall served as United States Ambassador to the United Nations Agencies for Food and Agriculture, and as chief of the United States Mission to the UN Agencies in Rome, which includes the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Food Programme, and the International Fund for Agricultural Development. Subsequently, Hall worked on a Middle East peace initiative in collaboration with the Center for the Study of the Presidency. Early life and education Hall was born in Dayton, Ohio. His father, Dave Hall, served as a Republican mayor of Dayton. Hall's brother, Sam Hall was an Olympic diver, self-described \\"terrorist-hunter\\", and politician who served in the Ohio House of Representatives. Another brother, Mike, worked as an educator. Hall graduated from Fairmont High School in Kettering, Ohio, in 1960. He received a bachelor's degree from Denison University in 1964. While in college, Hall was named Little All-American football tailback and the Ohio Conference's Most Valuable Player (1963).  Career  After college, Hall served as Peace Corps Volunteer in Thailand, teaching English in 1966 and 1967, an experience that contributed to his strong interest in world hunger issues. Hall then worked as a real estate agent. Ohio Legislature Hall became active in politics, joining the Democratic Party in a change from his father's affiliation. He was elected as a member of the Ohio House of Representatives, serving from 1969 to 1973, and as an Ohio state senator from 1973 to 1979. In 1974, Hall ran for Ohio Secretary of State and lost to Republican incumbent Ted W. Brown. U.S. Representative  Hall was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1978, to succeed 12-year incumbent Charles W. Whalen Jr., a moderate Republican. He won election with 54 percent of the vote, but would never face another contest anywhere near that close. He would be reelected 11 more times, never dropping below 57 percent of the vote. As a measure of how popular he was in the Dayton area, he was unopposed for reelection in 1984 even as Ronald Reagan carried the district in a landslide. He was unopposed again in 1990, and faced no major-party opposition in 1982 and 2000. In the 1980s, Hall became an evangelical Christian, prompting him to change his position on abortion from abortion rights to pro-life. Otherwise, his voting record was decidedly liberal. During his tenure in Congress, Hall concentrated on seeking to alleviate world hunger. He made frequent trips to more than 100 countries such as Sierra Leone, Ethiopia, Sudan, and North Korea where hunger was widespread. He was chairman of the Select Committee on Hunger from 1989 to 1993. When the committee was abolished, Hall fasted for 22 days in protest. He was founder of the Congressional Friends of Human Rights Monitors and the Congressional Hunger Center. Hall served terms on the foreign affairs and small business committees before being appointed to the House Rules Committee in 1981. Twice during his tenure as U.S. representative, Hall introduced legislation that would have apologized for slavery in the United States. Hall was an Ohio delegate to the 2000 Democratic National Convention. U.S. Ambassador Hall served in the House into 2002, when President George W. Bush nominated him to succeed George McGovern as United States Ambassador to the United Nations Agencies for Food and Agriculture. Hall's confirmation to the post was held up for several months, but he was confirmed and sworn into the post in September 2002 by U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell. He served in this position until 2006, leading as chief of the United States Mission to the UN Agencies in Rome, which includes the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Food Programme, and the International Fund for Agricultural Development. Later career With Tom Price, Hall wrote Changing the Face of Hunger: One Man's Story of How Liberals, Conservatives, Democrats, Republicans, and People of Faith Are Joining Forces to Help the Hungry, the Poor, and the Oppressed (2007). In March 2007, Hall announced he was committed to fostering a Middle East peace initiative, by working with the Center for the Study of the Presidency and religious leaders of the Holy Land, principally among Muslims, Christians and Jews in the Middle East. Under a $1 million grant from U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice via the U.S. Agency for International Development, to be applied to both economics and faith-based efforts, Hall was to work with religious leaders to help prepare the way for peace in the Middle East. Hall received no salary for his work. He serves as executive director emeritus of The Alliance to End Hunger. Hall also serves on the Board of Advisors of Opportunity International, a charity that seeks to end poverty through microcredit lending to entrepreneurs.  Personal life  Hall and his wife, Janet Sue Dick, were married in 1973. They had two children together, Jyl Hall Smith and Matthew Hall. Matthew died in 1996, at age 15, of leukemia.

In Major League Baseball (MLB), Jackson played for the New York Giants from 1922 through 1936, winning the 1933 World Series, and representing the Giants in the MLB All-Star in 1934. After his retirement as a player, Jackson managed in minor league baseball through to the 1960 season. Jackson was discovered by Kid Elberfeld at a minor league baseball game at the age of 14. Elberfeld signed Jackson to his first professional contract, and recommended him to John McGraw, manager of the Giants. His exceptional range at shortstop led to the nickname \\"Stonewall.\\" Jackson was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982. Early life Jackson was born in Waldo, Arkansas on November 2, 1903. He was the only child of William Jackson, a wholesale grocer, and his wife Etta, who named their son after William B. Travis, a lieutenant colonel who died at the Battle of the Alamo. Jackson's father bought him a baseball when he was three years old, and they often played catch together. Jackson's uncle took him to a Little Rock Travelers minor-league game when he was 14 years old. At the game, Jackson's uncle introduced him to Kid Elberfeld, telling Elberfeld that his nephew was a talented baseball player. Elberfeld observed Jackson in an impromtu workout, and asked Jackson to contact him when he was ready to begin his professional career. Jackson attended Ouachita Baptist University in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, where he starred on the college baseball team. While there, he injured his knee, and this injury would recur during Jackson's career. Professional career Playing career Following Jackson's collegiate career, Elberfeld signed Jackson to his first contract, and he played for Little Rock in 1921 and 1922. Jackson committed 72 errors during the 1922 season, which he considered the \\"world record for errors\\". Despite this, Elberfeld recommended Jackson to John McGraw, manager of the New York Giants of the National League (NL), who was entitled to a Travelers player as he had lent a player to the team in 1922. McGraw signed Jackson to a contract on June 30, effective at the end of the Southern Association's 1922 season. Jackson debuted with the Giants on September 22, 1922, appearing in three games. With Dave Bancroft and Heinie Groh, the Giants' starting shortstop and third baseman respectively, sidelined with injuries incurred during the 1923 season, Jackson drew notice as a fill- in. McGraw was confident enough in Jackson's abilities to trade Bancroft before the 1924 season, choosing Jackson to be the Giants' starting shortstop. Though there was doubt that Jackson could adequately replace Bancroft, Jackson played in 151 games during the 1924 season and hit .302 with 11 home runs. The Giants lost the 1924 World Series to the Washington Senators, with Jackson committing a key error in Game 7. Jackson was considered one of the best shortstops of his era, and he led NL shortstops with a .970 fielding percentage in 1931. However, he missed considerable playing time in his career resulting from injuries and illnesses. Jackson reinjured his knee in 1925, missed significant time during the 1926 season and had surgery for appendicitis during the 1927 season. He missed time with mumps in 1930 and influenza in 1932, and he continued to battle knee problems, missing much of the 1932 and 1933 seasons. Jackson was said to \\"at 28, already [have] one foot in the minors\\". Despite this, manager Bill Terry said that Jackson would \\"make or break\\" the 1933 season. Though Jackson fell behind Blondy Ryan on the team's depth chart during the season, he returned in the 1933 World Series, which the Giants won over the Senators. Jackson's 1933 Goudey baseball card Terry stayed with Jackson as the Giants' starting shortstop for the 1934 season, in which he drove in 101 runs and was chosen to appear in the 1934 MLB All-Star Game. Jackson played third base in his final two seasons, serving as team captain, although he struggled in the 1936 World Series, which the Giants lost to the New York Yankees. After the season, the Giants requested waivers on Jackson to assign him to the minor leagues. Jackson batted over .300 six times, including a career-high .339 in the 1930 season, and hit 21 home runs in 1929. He was on four NL pennant-winning teams and one World Series champion (1933). Jackson finished his MLB career with 135 home runs, 929 RBI and a .291 batting average. Coaching and managing career Jackson signed a three- year contract with the Jersey City Giants of the Class-AA International League after the 1936 season. The team, which the Giants had purchased to become their farm team that offseason, was moved from Albany, New York, with Jackson to serve as player-manager. Jackson's knees prevented him from appearing in many games with Jersey City as a player, but he remained as the team's manager until July 1938, when he was replaced with Hank DeBerry. The Giants brought Jackson back to the majors as a coach for the remaining 18 months on his contract, succeeding Tommy Clarke, who became a scout. Jackson missed the next five seasons as he battled tuberculosis, eventually returning to manage in the Boston Braves/Milwaukee Braves system for the Jackson Senators in the Class-B Southeastern League in 1946. Jackson returned to the Giants to coach in 1947 and 1948, receiving his unconditional release following the 1948 season. Returning to the Braves' minor league system, Jackson managed the Tampa Smokers of the Class-B Florida International League in 1949, but resigned in July during a losing streak. He managed the Owensboro Oilers of the Class-D Kentucky‚ÄìIllinois‚ÄìTennessee League in 1950, and began the 1951 season managing the Bluefield Blue-Greys of the Class-D Appalachian League, but was reassigned to the Hartford Chiefs of the Class-A Eastern League when Hartford manager Tommy Holmes was named the Braves' manager. Jackson managed the Appleton Papermakers of the Class-D Wisconsin State League in 1952 and 1953, the Lawton Braves of the Class-D Sooner State League from 1954 through 1957, the Midland Braves of the Class-D Sophomore League in 1958, the Eau Claire Braves of the Class-C Northern League in 1959 and the Davenport Braves of the Class-D Midwest League in 1960. Personal life Jackson and his wife, Mary, had two children, Dorothy Fincher and William Travis Jackson, six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. Jackson died of Alzheimer's disease in 1987. Honors As defensive standouts have historically been overshadowed by power hitters in Baseball Hall of Fame voting, Jackson was not elected through the annual balloting process despite his record and achievements. But in 1982, he was inducted into the Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee. He was also inducted in the Arkansas Hall of Fame.

Archbishop Benjamin (Peterson) wearing great omophorion in Alaska. In the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic liturgical tradition, the omophorion (, meaning \\"[something] borne on the shoulders\\"; Slavonic: –æ–º–æ—Ñ–æ—Ä—ä, omofor) is the distinguishing vestment of a bishop and the symbol of his spiritual and ecclesiastical authority. Originally woven of wool, it is a band of brocade decorated with four crosses and an eight-pointed star; it is worn about the neck and shoulders.St Vladimir's Seminary By symbolizing the lost sheep that is found and carried on the Good Shepherd's shoulders, it signifies the bishop's pastoral role as the icon of Christ. All Orthodox bishops wear the omophorion. Clergy and ecclesiastical institutions, including seminaries, subject to a bishop's authority are often said to be \\"under his omophorion\\". The equivalent vestment in Western Christian usage is the archiepiscopal pallium, the use of which is subject to different rubrics and restrictions. Use Bishop wearing small omophorion. The omophorion has two forms: the ancient great omophorion, which passes around the neck, is folded in the front, and hangs down past the knees in both the front and the back, like a loosely worn long scarf; and the small omophorion which is much simpler, passing around the neck and hanging down in the front similar to an epitrachelion (stole), only wider and shorter, coming down a little past the waist. Because of the complexity of the great omophorion, and because of the dignity of the episcopal office, whenever the bishop puts on the omophorion or takes it off, he is assisted by two subdeacons. Whenever the bishop presides at any divine service, he will be vested in the omophorion. If he is serving the Divine Liturgy, he will wear both the great and the small omophorion at different times over his liturgical vestments. At any service other than the Divine Liturgy, he will usually wear the small omophorion. At the Divine Liturgy, the rubrics call for the bishop to put on and take off the omophorion numerous times. When he is first vested, the subdeacons place the great omophorion on him, but afterwards, when the rubric calls for him to wear the omophorion, it is replaced, for the sake of convenience, with the small omophorion. In some places, when several bishops concelebrate, it is now the custom for the chief celebrant to use the great omophorion when called for, and the other bishops to wear the small omophorion throughout. In the Ruthenian Catholic Church and the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, often only the great omophorion is used. In this simplified usage, the great omophorion is not replaced by the small omophorion, and is worn by the bishop throughout the entire liturgy. In such cases, the omophorion is often sewn into shape and can be simply draped onto the shoulders rather than wrapped on by assistants. Some Ukrainian Greek Catholic bishops, however, insist on the full ceremonial. During the All-Night Vigil, the bishop will wear the small omophorion at the beginning, but near the end will change into the great omophorion for the Great Doxology. Development Major archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk wearing a white omophorion which has been sewn into shape (with five bars at the bottom, signifying his position as head of an Eastern rite church). In the early church, the omophorion was a broad band of white wool ornamented with crosses and draped loosely over the neck, shoulders, and breast. The modern Roman pallium developed from this early omophorion. In the West, over the centuries, its form has changed into a circular, thin woolen garment for the shoulders, with short, weighted pendants before and behind. The papal pallium, originally adopted by Pope Benedict XVI at the beginning of his pontificate, is closer to the original omophorion. Pope Benedict XVI later reverted to the original design of the pallium, but with red crosses instead of black. In the East, the only change in the omophorion has been an increase in its width and a shift in the material from which it is made. The omophorion was documented about the year 400 AD as a liturgical vestment of the bishop in Isidore of Pelusium. It was made of wool and was already seen as symbolic of the duties of bishops as shepherds of their flocks. In the miniatures of an Alexandrian Chronicle of the World, written probably during the fifth century, the omophorion was represented in an image. In later times, it was shown on the renowned ivory tablet of Trier, depicting the solemn translation of relics. Among the pictures dating from the seventh and eighth centuries, in which the omophorion is illustrated, are the lately discovered frescoes in S. Maria, Antiqua in the Roman Forum. The representation of the omophorion in these frescoes is essentially the same as the vestment in its present form. The omophorion probably developed from the civil omophorion, a shoulder garment or shawl in general use. Bishops may have introduced directly by a positive precept a humeral cloth resembling the ordinary omophorion and called by that name, , to be used as a liturgical pontifical badge. Alternatively, bishops may have used the civil omophorion as an ornament without any special significance, but in the course of time it gradually developed associations as a distinctively episcopal ornament. Finally it symbolized an episcopal badge of office. Oriental Orthodoxy Archbishop Sebouh Chouldjian of the Armenian Apostolic Church wearing emip'oron during liturgy. In Oriental Orthodoxy, the omophorion takes a number of different forms: * The Armenian Apostolic emip'oron is similar to the Byzantine great omophorion. * The Syriac Orthodox ba≈£ra≈°il or uroro rabbo ('great stole') is a straight strip of embroidered material, about 20 cm wide, with a head-hole midway along it, that hangs down a bishop's chest and back. * Coptic Orthodox hierarchs (Patriarch, Metropolitans and bishops) wear the omophorion, usually folded, due to its large width. It is white in colour, with extensive ornamental embroidery. It is wider than its Byzantine counterpart, wrapped over the head over the monastic kouklion, then crossed from the front over the chest, wrapped again from the back, crossed over the back by the waist level, then over the shoulders, then coming straight down, tucked under the frontal (over the chest) crossed wrapping. It is called a ballin, and it is almost double the length of the Byzantine omophorion.

First serialized in Outing magazine, it was published in 1906. The story details White Fang's journey to domestication in Yukon Territory and the Northwest Territories during the 1890s Klondike Gold Rush. It is a companion novel (and a thematic mirror) to London's best-known work, The Call of the Wild (1903), which is about a kidnapped, domesticated dog embracing his wild ancestry to survive and thrive in the wild. Much of White Fang is written from the viewpoint of the titular canine character, enabling London to explore how animals view their world and how they view humans. White Fang examines the violent world of wild animals and the equally violent world of humans. The book also explores complex themes including morality and redemption. As early as 1925, the story was adapted to film, and it has since seen several more cinematic adaptations, including a 1991 film starring Ethan Hawke and a 2018 original film for Netflix. Plot summary The story begins before the wolf-dog hybrid is born, with two men and their sled dog team on a journey to deliver the coffin of Lord Alfred to a remote town named Fort McGurry in the higher area of the Yukon Territory. The men, Bill and Henry, are stalked by a large pack of starving wolves over the course of several days. Finally, after all of their dogs and Bill have been eaten, four more teams find Henry escaping from the wolves; the wolf pack scatters when they hear the large group of people coming. The story then follows the pack, which has been robbed of its last prey. When the pack finally brings down a moose, the famine is ended; they eventually split up, and the story now follows a she-wolf and her mate, One Eye. One Eye claimed her after defeating and killing a younger rival. The she- wolf gives birth to a litter of five cubs by the Mackenzie River, and all but one die from hunger. One Eye is killed by a lynx while trying to rob her den for food for the she-wolf and her cub; his mate later discovers his remains near the lynx's den. The surviving cub and the she-wolf are left to fend for themselves. Shortly afterward, the she-wolf kills all the lynx's kittens to feed her cub, prompting the lynx to track her down, and a vicious fight breaks out. The she-wolf eventually kills the lynx but suffers severe injury; the lynx carcass is devoured over a period of seven days as the she-wolf recovers from her injuries. One day, the cub comes across five indigenous people, and the she-wolf comes to his rescue. One man, Grey Beaver, recognizes the she- wolf as his brother's wolfdog, Kiche, who left during a famine. Grey Beaver's brother is dead, and so he takes Kiche and her cub and christens the cub \\"White Fang\\". White Fang has a harsh life in the native camp; the current puppy pack, seeing him as a wolf, immediately attacks him. The Indians save him, but the pups never accept him, and the leader, Lip-Lip, singles him out for persecution. White Fang grows to become a savage, callous, morose, solitary, and deadly fighter, \\"the enemy of his kind\\". It is at this time that White Fang is separated from his mother, who is sold off to another Indian camp by Three Eagles. He realizes how hard life in the wild is when he runs away from camp, and earns the respect of Grey Beaver when he saves his son Mit-Sah from a group of boys seeking revenge. When a famine occurs, he runs away into the woods and encounters his mother Kiche, only for her to chase him away, for she has a new litter of cubs and has forgotten him. He also encounters Lip-Lip, whom he fights and kills before returning to the camp. When White Fang is five years old, he is taken to Fort Yukon, so that Grey Beaver can trade with the gold-hunters. There, when Grey Beaver is drunk, White Fang is bought by an evil dog-fighter named \\"Beauty\\" Smith. White Fang defeats all opponents pitted against him, including several wolves and a lynx, until a bulldog called Cherokee is brought in to fight him. Cherokee has the upper hand in the fight when he grips the skin and fur of White Fang's neck and begins to throttle him. White Fang nearly suffocates, but is rescued when a rich, young gold hunter, Weedon Scott, stops the fight, and forcefully buys White Fang from Beauty Smith. Scott attempts to tame White Fang, and after a long, patient effort, he succeeds. When Scott attempts to return to California alone, White Fang pursues him, and Scott decides to take the dog with him back home. In Sierra Vista, White Fang must adjust to the laws of the estate. At the end of the book, an escaped convict, Jim Hall, tries to kill Scott's father, Judge Scott, for sentencing him to prison for a crime he did not commit, not knowing that Hall was \\"railroaded\\". White Fang kills Hall and is nearly killed himself, but survives. As a result, the women of Scott's estate name him \\"The Blessed Wolf\\". The story ends with White Fang relaxing in the sun with the puppies he has fathered with the sheep-dog Collie. Main characters Major animal characters: *White Fang, the novel's protagonist; a wolfdog who was born wild but becomes more dog-like after Gray Beaver domesticates him. He gets bullied by Lip-lip and was forced to become a fighting dog when he was bought by Beauty Smith. However, his life changed when a loving master named Weedon Scott buys him and takes him to his home in Santa Clara Valley in California. He eventually becomes a part of the family after saving Judge Scott from Jim Hall. *Kiche, White Fang's mother, a sled dog owned by Gray Beaver, known at the beginning of the novel as the \\"she- wolf\\". Possibly named for the Algonquian deity Gitche Manitou. *Lip-lip, a canine pup who also lives in the Native American village and bullies White Fang. *One-Eye, White Fang's father, a true wolf, who was killed by the lynx. *Cherokee, a bulldog who was the only dog to defeat White Fang. *Collie, a sheepdog, mother of White Fang's whelps. *The Lynx, an aggressive Canada lynx who was responsible for killing One-Eye, but later gets killed by Kiche in retaliation. Major human characters: *Gray Beaver, a Native American chief who is White Fang's first master. He is a neutral master, neither as cruel as Beauty Smith, nor as kind as Weedon Scott. *Beauty Smith, the main antagonist of the novel and White Fang's second master; a dogfighter. *Weedon Scott, a wealthy gold hunter who is White Fang's third master and the first one to truly show affection towards him. *Matt, Weedon Scott's assistant who helps tame White Fang. *Judge Scott, Weedon Scott's father who accepts White Fang as a member of the family after he saves him from Jim Hall. *Jim Hall, a violent fugitive who tries to get revenge on Judge Scott, but gets killed by White Fang. *Henry, a character appeared in the introduction of the novel, carrying the coffin of Lord Alfred with Bill. *Bill, a character appeared in the introduction of the novel alongside Henry and was killed by the wolves led by Kiche. *Three Eagles, an Indian who buys Kiche from Gray Beaver.  Major themes  Critics have identified many underlying themes in the novel. Tom Feller describes the story as \\"an allegory of humanity's progression from nature to civilization\\". He also expresses that \\"the [story's] implication is that the metamorphosis of both the individual and society will require violence at some point.\\" Paul Deane states that \\"[in the novel] society demands a conformity that undermines individualism.\\" London himself took influence from Herbert Spencer's words: \\"survival of the fittest\\", as well as Friedrich Nietzsche's idea of a \\"superman\\" (or \\"superdog\\", in this instance) and of \\"the worship of power\\".  Background  The novel is partly an autobiographical allegory based on London's conversion from teenage hoodlum to married, middle-class writer. In writing it, he was influenced by the ideas of Herbert Spencer, Karl Marx, and Friedrich Nietzsche. Conditions in the US also influenced the story.  Publication history  Since the novel has been published it has been translated into over 89 different languages and released as a three-volume Braille edition.  Reception  Upon its release, White Fang was an immediate success worldwide, and became especially popular among younger readers. Robert Greenwood called White Fang \\"one of London's most interesting and ambitious works.\\" Virginia Crane claims that the novel is \\"generally regarded as artistically inferior to its companion piece [The Call of the Wild], but [that it] helped establish London as a popular American literary figure\\". Shortly after the book's publication, London became a target in what would later be called the nature fakers controversy, a literary debate highlighting the conflict between science and sentiment in popular nature writing. President Theodore Roosevelt, who first spoke out against the \\"sham naturalists\\" in 1907, specifically named London as one of the so-called \\"nature fakers\\". Citing an example from White Fang, Roosevelt referred to the fight between the bulldog and the wolfdog \\"the very sublimity of absurdity.\\" London only responded to the criticism after the controversy had ended. In a 1908 essay entitled \\"The Other Animals\\", he wrote:  Adaptations  The novel has been adapted into numerous pictures and sequels, animated specials, as well as an audiobook format. A television series, White Fang, was filmed in Arrowtown, New Zealand, in 1993.

In January 2001, Automatic Media announced its first original venture, Plastic.com. Plastic sought to minimize operational costs by running entirely on user-contributed stories. Its staff initially consisted of four people. Demise Less than a year after its foundation, Automatic Media's subsidiaries declared bankruptcy, citing \\"an inability to secure additional financing\\". Feed and Suck both announced that they were firing their staffs, and would no longer produce content. It was also announced that Plastic would continue with a skeleton staff working pro bono, although its fate was uncertain until bought by one of suck's original founders Carl Steadman. Impact Automatic Media's echoed the failure of many other web content sites. The failure of these sites disproved the common notion that the World Wide Web would make it easy for independent media sites to publish and distribute content for cheap compared with the cost of putting out print magazines. Combined with the questions raised by other dot-com collapses, investors were now questioning whether advertising alone could sustain the enormous and often underestimated costs of producing and hosting original material.

Sherman Island, with the Sacramento River above and San Joaquin River below The Sacramento‚ÄìSan Joaquin River Delta, or California Delta, is an expansive inland river delta and estuary in Northern California. The Delta is formed at the western edge of the Central Valley by the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers and lies just east of where the rivers enter Suisun Bay. The Delta is recognized for protection by the California Bays and Estuaries Policy. Sacramento‚ÄìSan Joaquin Delta was designated a National Heritage Area on March 12, 2019. The city of Stockton is located on the San Joaquin River on the eastern edge of the delta. The total area of the Delta, including both land and water, is about . Its population is around 500,000 residents. The Delta was formed by the raising of sea level following glaciation, leading to the accumulation of Sacramento and San Joaquin River sediments behind the Carquinez Strait, the sole outlet from the Central Valley to the San Pablo and San Francisco Bays and the Pacific Ocean. The narrowness of the Carquinez Strait coupled with tidal action has caused the sediment to pile up, forming expansive islands. Geologically, the Delta has existed for about 10,000 years, since the end of the Last Glacial Period. In its natural state, the Delta was a large freshwater marsh, consisting of many shallow channels and sloughs surrounding low islands of peat and tule. Since the mid-19th century, most of the region has been gradually claimed for agriculture. Wind erosion and oxidation have led to widespread subsidence on the Central Delta islands; much of the Delta region today sits below sea level, behind levees earning it the nickname \\"California's Holland\\".Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, U.S.G.S. Much of the water supply for Central California and Southern California is also derived from the Delta, via pumps located at the southern end of the Delta. The pumps deliver water for irrigation in the San Joaquin Valley and municipal water supply for Southern California. Geography The Old River, a former channel of the San Joaquin River located in the southwestern Delta The Delta consists of approximately 57 reclaimed islands and tracts but there are nearly 200 islands in the delta that are named or not named. These are all surrounded by of levees that border of waterways. The southwestern side of the Delta lies at the foothills of the California Coast Ranges, while to the northwest sit the lower Montezuma Hills. Most of the Delta lies within Contra Costa, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Solano and Yolo Counties. The total human population of the Delta was 515,264 as of 2000. Altogether, the Delta covers , with , or nearly 73 percent, devoted to agriculture. About of the Delta area is urban and are undeveloped land. The rivers, streams, sloughs and waterways of the Delta total about of surface, although this fluctuates greatly with seasons and tides. Geologically, it is not considered a true river delta, but rather an inverted river delta, as it formed inward (sediments accumulating progressively inland) rather than outward. The only other major river delta in the world located this far inland is the Pearl River Delta in China.Reisner, p. 18 The main source rivers include the Sacramento River from the north, the San Joaquin from the southeast, and the Calaveras and Mokelumne Rivers from the east. The Calaveras and Mokelumne are both tributaries of the San Joaquin River. The Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers join at the western end of the Delta near Pittsburg, at the head of Suisun Bay, although they are linked upstream by the Georgiana Slough, which was first used by steamboats in the 19th century as a shortcut between Sacramento and Stockton. The southwestern part of the Delta is also transected by the Middle River and Old River, former channels of the San Joaquin. These rivers transport more than of water through the Delta each year ‚Äì about 50 percent of all California's runoff. Nearby cities include Lodi and Stockton to the east, Tracy and Manteca to the south, Brentwood to the southwest, and Pittsburg and Antioch to the west. The state capital, Sacramento, is located just to the north of the Delta. The Sacramento River Deep Water Ship Channel connects the Delta to the Port of Sacramento, with its terminus located near Rio Vista, on the northwestern side of the Delta. The Stockton Ship Channel is a dredged and partially straightened section of the San Joaquin River cutting directly through the Delta from the Port of Stockton to the San Joaquin's confluence with the Sacramento near Antioch. Geology, formation and natural conditions The Delta was formerly located at the bottom of a large inland sea in the Central Valley, which formed as the uplift of the California Coast Ranges blocked off drainage from the Sierra Nevada to the Pacific. About 560,000 years ago, water breached the mountains, carving out the present-day Carquinez Strait and San Francisco Bay. The drainage of all the water through this narrow gap formed a bottleneck in the Central Valley's outflow; this constriction is essential to provoke the slowing of river current and the resulting sediment deposits that now make up the Delta. The Delta in its contemporary (pre-1850s) state began to form about 10,000 years ago at the end of the last Ice Age. During the Ice Age global sea levels were about lower than today, and the Delta region, as well as Suisun Bay, the Carquinez Strait and San Francisco Bay, were a river valley through which the continuation of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers flowed to the Pacific Ocean. When sea levels rose again, ocean water backed up through the Carquinez Strait into the Central Valley; the combination of the narrow strait and tidal action pushing inland dramatically slowed the current of these rivers and forced them to drop sediment. The early delta was composed of shifting channels, sand dunes, alluvial fans and floodplains that underwent constant fluctuation because of rapidly rising seas ‚Äì per year. About 8,000 years ago, the rate of sea-level rise slackened, allowing wetland plants to take hold in the Delta, trapping sediment; the growth and decay of these plants began to form the vast peat deposits that make up the Delta islands. The Delta reached a stabilized form similar to its mid-1800s state about 2,000‚Äì3,000 years ago.Pierce, pp. 4‚Äì5 An 1850 drawing of the Sacramento River in the Delta, showing the lush foliage that made up much of the virgin Delta. Immediately before large-scale human development, most of the Delta islands had saucer- like cross sections, with low natural levees flanking a marshy interior \\"bowl\\" that flooded intermittently with the seasons and tides. The height of these natural levees, formed from overbank deposits of sediments deposited by annual river floods, ranged from above mean high tide at Sherman Island on the Sacramento River, to at Andrus, Staten and Tyler Islands, located further east near the Mokelumne River. An estimated 60 percent of the Delta flooded for up to two hours each day at high tide; during spring tides or river floods, it was not uncommon for the entire Delta to be under water.Thompson, pp. 45‚Äì46 History Humans have inhabited the Delta for up to 4,300 years.Pierce, p. 11 The estimated indigenous population of the Delta at the time of first contact with Europeans was about 3,000‚Äì15,000, predominantly Miwok and Maidu, with some estimates ranging up to 20,000. The Native Americans lived in villages of 200‚Äì1,000 people on the eastern edge of the Delta, where the land was higher and less susceptible to flooding. Their lives centered around the abundant reeds or tules that grew on the Delta islands, which they used to make houses, boats, and garments. Staple foods included tule roots and pollen, acorns, wild fruits and seeds, fish and game. Europeans first entered the Delta region in 1772, when Spanish explorer Don Pedro Fages and missionary Juan Cresp√≠ observed the Delta from the summit of nearby Mount Diablo. For decades, the Delta was little utilized by the Spanish colonists. Expeditions from 1806‚Äì1812 failed to locate suitable mission sites in the Delta area. However, frequent military expeditions were made into the Delta from 1813‚Äì1845 in response to animosities between the Native Americans and the Spanish and later Mexicans; also several land grants were made in the vicinity of the Delta, including one to John Augustus Sutter, who started the first significant European settlement in the Central Valley just north of the Delta near present-day Sacramento. An 1873 map showing the river systems of the Central Valley, with wetlands marked in gray. The Delta, at roughly left center, was the largest area of contiguous, perennial wetlands in pre- development California. The Spanish conscripted large numbers of Native Americans for labor on missions; many Native Americans fled deep into the Delta in order to escape their European masters. However, this did not protect them from diseases. A malaria epidemic in 1833 decimated local native populations; this was probably exacerbated by the marshy geography of the area, which bred large amounts of mosquitoes. The agricultural value of the Delta was first recognized during the California Gold Rush, when farmers planted orchards on Delta islands to provide fresh fruit for mining camps in the Sierra Nevada.Reisner, pp. 18‚Äì19 Because of the flat terrain coupled with year-round availability of fresh water, irrigation here was cheaper and simpler than other fertile regions of California. As a result, the Delta remained California's richest farming region (alongside Los Angeles County) until the 1940s, when massive federal water projects finally made possible the full-scale irrigation of the main body of the Central Valley. Today, the Delta is still among the state's most productive farming regions. In 1850, Congress passed the Arkansas or Swampland Act, which allowed for the transfer of title for wetlands to private owners on the conditions that the land would be reclaimed. In California, more than of wetlands were partitioned under the Swampland Act, of which were in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, roughly the same amount of land that has been developed to date. Agricultural interests in the Delta were protected by the building of levees, a colossal effort first undertaken by Chinese laborers from the 1850s to the 1870s. The Board of Reclamation, formed in 1861, collectivized levee construction in the Delta by grouping islands into areas known as reclamation districts. The early levees were built of peat, and were highly susceptible to wind and water erosion. The Great Flood of 1862 obliterated much of the existing Delta infrastructure, forcing landowners to rebuild their levees higher and stronger; more flooding in 1878 and 1881 reinforced these notions. Although land holdings in the Delta were initially limited to per buyer, this limit was repealed in 1868, allowing large agricultural conglomerates to take entire islands and carry out massive reclamation projects. From 1868‚Äì1869, the entirety of Sherman Island, some , was diked and drained by a system of levees, flumes and floodgates.Thompson, p. 48 By the 1890s, the original levee system had been largely replaced with stronger embankments consisting of clay dredged from nearby river bottoms.Thompson, p. 43 By 1900, about , or nearly half of the Delta's land area, had been reclaimed. Most of the farmable land in the Delta had been reclaimed by the 1920s. Economy and human use Agriculture The Delta produces crops valued at about $650 million annually (for the 1998‚Äì2004 period), making it one of the most productive farming regions of the United States in terms of crop value per unit area. Agriculture provides secondary benefits of over $2 billion to the local economy. Major crops grown in the Delta include corn, grain, hay, sugar beets, alfalfa, tomatoes, asparagus, and safflower; various fruits are also raised here, as well as some livestock. Crops in the Delta cannot be irrigated using conventional methods due to the highly absorbent quality of the peat soil and irregularities caused by land subsidence. Irrigation is typically carried out periodically by piping water into small \\"spud ditches\\", which spread water over large areas and raise the local water table. The heightened groundwater is then gradually depleted by the crop until irrigation is required again. Transportation Delta waterways are also major transportation corridors for agricultural products; the ports of Sacramento and Stockton, located on the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, respectively, are the most important inland ports in California. The San Joaquin River throughout most of the Delta and the lower Sacramento River below its connection to the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel are routinely dredged to allow the passage of large cargo ships. The Sacramento River corridor has been maintained to a depth of as early as 1899, and was deepened to in 1955. The Stockton Ship Channel has been dredged since 1913; however, its present depth of was only achieved in 1987. The Delta is also home to the port of Benicia, an automobile and bulk shipping facility.Freight Planning Fact Sheet: Port of Benicia, California Dept. of Transportation, Caltrans Office of System and Freight Planning, July 2012, retrieved 24 November 2018. Petroleum is shipped to both the Benicia Refinery and the Martinez Refinery by water. Nearby is the Port Chicago Marine Ocean Terminal, a facility that supports the U.S. Navy. Water supply The Delta (located south of Sacramento, middle left, at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers) is central to California's water supply system. The Delta is often considered the nexus of California's statewide water system. About half the total river flow in the state passes through this region, from which water is exported to the San Joaquin Valley, Southern California and portions of the Bay area to supply some of farmland and 23 million people in central and Southern California. The Delta provides an estimated of water per year, of which about are exported to the San Francisco Bay Area, are used locally, and over are exported to the San Joaquin Valley, coastal Central and Southern California. Intrusion of brackish water into the Delta is a recurring natural phenomenon; however, it became a serious issue after the development of agriculture in the upper Sacramento and San Joaquin valley reduced inflows. Multiple droughts between 1910 and 1940 caused significant salinity intrusion in the Delta because of the reduction of freshwater inflows. The growing Delta water quality issue provided the initial impetus for building dams on Central Valley rivers to boost dry-season freshwater flows. This eventually became the federal Central Valley Project (CVP), California's first major statewide water system, most of which was built between the 1930s and the 1960s. Today, the California Aqueduct and the Delta-Mendota Canal, two of the state's largest water conveyance facilities, both draw water from the southern end of the Delta at the Clifton Court Forebay. Built in the mid-twentieth century, the former supplies water to the Los Angeles Basin and coastal central California via the State Water Project; the latter, a part of the CVP, provides supplies of irrigation water in the fertile San Joaquin Valley. Although the vast majority of water supplied by these projects is used for agriculture and urban areas, some water is also provided for wildlife refuges and habitat conservation works. The Contra Costa Canal and North Bay Aqueduct also take Delta water, supplying the nearby San Francisco Bay Area. Locally, the Delta provides water for cities and towns in five counties and for over 1,800 agricultural users.  Recreation  The Delta is also a popular site for recreation and is used for sailing, waterskiing, houseboating, fishing, and hunting.California State Parks Planning Division, Recreation Proposal for the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and Suisun Marsh, 2011. url:http://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/795/files/delta%20rec%20proposal_08_02_11.pdf, retrieved 23 Nov 2018. The Delta is home to over 100 marinas and 25 yacht clubs. In 2010, over seven million 'annual visitor boating days' occurred on the Delta, according to a local government survey. The Delta is home to several state and regional parks, reflecting a variety of recreational activities. These include historical interpretative centers, including Delta Meadows and Locke Boarding House and the Old Sacramento State Historic Park. The Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial offers visitors a chance to learn about the disaster that represented the largest domestic loss of life in the U.S. in World War II, and the impact it had on race relations in the U.S. military. Brannan Island State Recreation Area offers boat launches and facilities that support fishing, windsurfing, waterskiing, and sailing, in addition to campsites, picnic areas and trails to allow visitors to explore the marshes and islands of the area. Originally a Delta farming island, Franks Tract flooded in 1936 and again in 1938. The levees were never repaired and the island remained submerged, becoming an expanse of open water dotted with remnants of the original levees now the only landforms. In 1959, the area became a state park. Franks Tract State Recreation Area is accessible only by water and is used for fishing, waterfowl hunting, and boating. The Pacific Flyway, a north-south route for migratory birds, crosses the Delta. The migratory birds provide both birdwatching and hunting opportunities. Including the northern Suisun Marsh, there are over 150 private duck clubs in the area. Effects of the levee system and freshwater diversion Land subsidence in the Delta as of 1995 The levee system allowed farmers to drain and reclaim almost of the Delta, then a tidal marsh. Once the rivers were confined to their riverbeds, the peat soil of the former tidal marsh was exposed to oxygen. As the oxygen-rich peat soil decomposed and then released carbon dioxide, profound subsidence of the land resulted, of up to 25 feet since the late 1800s. Currently, most of the Delta is below sea level, with a great deal of the western and central Delta at least below sea level. The California Department of Water Resources has experimented with re-flooding areas for wetland restoration, in order to sequester carbon and rebuild soil levels. Land subsidence has endangered the Delta's system of protective levees, occasionally triggering levee failure and subsequent flooding.Reisner, pp. 21‚Äì22 Land subsidence also allows brackish water intrusion into the Delta, an issue compounded by the diversion of up to 25% of the freshwater flowing into the Delta. The decreased volume of freshwater in the Delta has had a profound effect on its ecology. In most years, large dams in the Delta watershed fully hold back spring runoff; as a result the Delta is most susceptible to salinity intrusion between February and June. However, regulation provided by dams helps boost freshwater flows during dry summers and autumns, reducing the risk of salinity intrusion in these months. Diversions located at the southern end of the Delta, however, have negated some of the benefits of upstream dams. The powerful pumps that supply water for the Central Valley Project and State Water Project cause water in the Delta to flow from north to south instead of the natural direction of east to west. This has caused multiple environmental issues, such as the disruption of fish migration and salinity buildup in the eastern Delta, where salts can no longer be flushed to the sea by natural river flows. Levee failures Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta at flood stage, spring 2009. Photo by Doc Searls. Since 1900, there have been over 160 levee failures in the Sacramento‚ÄìSan Joaquin River Delta. These numbers include multiple failures of a single levee structure. Levee failures, also known as breaches, can be caused by overtopping or structural failure. One of the most recent examples of levee failure in the Sacramento‚ÄìSan Joaquin River Delta occurred in June 2004 when a levee breach caused more than of water to flood the entire island of Jones Tract. But, the significant improvements made to the Delta levee system since 1982 have reduced the incidence of failures to this one major failure in 30 years. The most up-to-date description and discussion of the Delta levee system can be found in the Economic Sustainability Plan of the Delta Protection Commission. This study concluded that the Delta levee system is now relatively robust but should be improved to effectively eliminate the risk of failure in extreme floods and earthquakes. It emphasizes the significant value of the infrastructure that passes through the Delta, including water conveyance, in addition to life and property, and the value of the Delta as a Place. A 2019 article states that \\"a catastrophic levee failure, defined as 20 islands flooding at once, has a 62 percent chance of occurring in the next two decades if subsidence isn‚Äôt addressed.\\" Simultaneous levee failures on the Delta's 57 islands in the wake of an earthquake which allow the inflow of brackish San Francisco Bay waters could threaten the water supply for the Central Valley, which includes both the irrigation water for its $17 billion agricultural economy and the drinking water for about 25 million people. Ecology About 500 plant and animal species inhabit the Delta, which is one of the largest estuaries in western North America. Before agricultural development of the Delta region, the Delta's many islands were forested by Tule, bulrush, and various reeds that flourished in intermittently flooded, low-lying marshy areas. Over thousands of years, the growth and decay of the various swampland plants formed a layer of peat deep in places, hence the extremely high fertility of Delta soils.Reisner, p. 20 Sediment deposits formed natural levees around the borders of islands, where larger trees, mainly willows,Thompson, p. 44 were able to take root and form large riparian forests. The riparian forests were most pronounced along the Sacramento River and the lower Mokelumne River below its confluence with the Cosumnes River.Pierce, p. 7 More extensive woodlands were prominent on the fringes of the Delta bordering the riparian zones. Composed primarily of valley oak, box elder and Oregon ash, these oak woodlands grew in bands that stretched up to inland. Farther away from water sources, vegetation gave way to grassland.Pierce, pp. 8‚Äì9 The water Hyacinth has become one of the most destructive plants to the Delta water way. Within one year it will spread and cover as much as of water space in one growing season. It has become a challenge to the agricultural community to eliminate. The plants spread by budding and spreading its seeds, and those seeds fall to the bottom of the water, where they can stay viable in the muck for years. The Hyacinth can form a mat up to thick, shutting off light and becoming acidic when they decompose.\\"Water Hyacinth\\" Tegtmeier The tiny Delta smelt is an Endangered Species Act threatened species that has caused controversy over the amount of water that can be sustainably pumped from the Delta. The Delta was formerly populated by large herds of deer and tule elk; their trails were so vast that early Spanish explorers supposed the area was inhabited by cattle. Significant numbers of California grizzly bears could also be found in the Delta. The extensive wetlands of the Delta supported massive bird populations, even today, half the migrating waterfowl in California still pass through the Delta. A survey in 2012 recorded a spring duck population of 48.6 million, the highest since counts began in 1955. Large mammals in the Delta have not fared so well; with most of their habitat converted to agriculture, remaining populations were highly susceptible to human impacts and natural disasters. Grizzlies were hunted to extinction, while the flood of 1878 wiped out the last of the elk herds in the Delta. The Delta is home to approximately 22 species of fish, including several Pacific salmon species, striped bass, steelhead trout, American shad and sturgeon. About two-thirds of California's salmon pass through the Delta on their way upstream to spawn. The small Delta smelt is a key indicator species for the health of the Delta's ecosystem. Delta fish populations have been significantly reduced due to the reclamation of marshland and diversions of fresh water. In 2004, the Delta smelt was found to be on the edge of extinction. The survival of the Delta smelt has been one of the largest environmental controversies in California, as environmental measures enacted to protect its population have often reduced the amount of water available for federal water projects that depend on water pumped from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment has issued a safe eating advisory for any fish caught in Central and South parts of the Delta due to elevated levels of mercury and PCBs. In addition, there is a notice of \\"DO NOT EAT\\" for any fish or shellfish from the Port of Stockton. There is a separated safe eating advisory for the Northern part of the Delta. Nutria were found in Merced County in 2017 on the edge of the Delta. State officials are concerned that they will harm the infrastructure that sends water to San Joaquin Valley farms and urban areas. Conservation efforts Water tower in Isleton, California After numerous rounds of mitigation following the 2005 Smelt Biological Opinion (BiOp) lead to pumping restrictions from the State and Federal projects from the Delta, a number of potential solutions to the Delta's problems have been proposed. These followed the CALFED process which had offered several staged solutions. A first set of alternatives would maintain the Delta in its current condition and configuration. The second would restore parts of the Delta more closely to its natural state but include the construction of an additional Peripheral Canal to maintain the water supply currently provided by the Delta. The launch of 100 floating sensors into the Sacramento River for the Floating Sensor Network project The Contra Costa County Public Works Department is working with the California Coastal Commission and the Department of Boating and Waterways to protect the drinking water quality, prevent pollution, and promote the environmental health of the Delta. In April 2009, the Sacramento River in the Delta was declared the nation's most endangered waterway system by the environmental group American Rivers, due to water shortages caused by the Delta's environmental problems, declining fish populations and aging levees, among other problems. Since the 1940s, various groups have lobbied for the construction of a Peripheral Canal to redirect water flowing from the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers directly to the federal aqueducts that draw water from the southern end of the Delta. Currently, freshwater entering the Delta has to flow through a maze of river channels and sloughs before entering the Clifton Court Forebay north of Tracy, where water is pumped into the California Aqueduct and Delta-Mendota Canal. In addition, large numbers of Delta smelt and other endangered species are killed by the pumping plants that provide water for the aqueducts. The current proposal, known as the Bay Delta Conservation Plan, entails building twin tunnels under the delta and is closely associated with Governor Jerry Brown. However, the Peripheral Canal proposal has been criticized because it would further reduce the amount of freshwater flowing through the Delta. Farmers in the Delta are among the most opposed to the project because it would decrease the amount of water available to them for irrigation. All solutions, however, aim to produce a Delta which simultaneously supports a vibrant ecosystem and continues to supply fresh water to the Central Valley Project, the State Water Project and the Bay Area. Sacramento‚ÄìSan Joaquin Delta National Heritage Area was designated on March 12, 2019, the first such designation for California, as part of the John D. Dingell Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act. The Sacramento‚ÄìSan Joaquin Delta National Heritage Area is managed by the Delta Protection Commission.
