His name may refer to the scorpion goddess Serket, though evidence suggests Serket's rise in popularity to be in the Old Kingdom, bringing doubt to whether Scorpion actually took his name from her. He was one of the first rulers of Ancient Egypt. Scorpion is believed to have lived in Thinis one or two centuries before the rule of the better-known Scorpion II of Nekhen and is presumably the first true king of Upper Egypt. To him belongs the U-j tomb found in the royal cemetery of Abydos, where Thinite kings were buried. That tomb was plundered in antiquity, but in it were found many small ivory plaques, each with a hole for tying it to something, and each marked with one or more hieroglyph-type scratched images which are thought to be names of towns, perhaps to tie the offerings and tributes to keep track of which came from which town. Two of those plaques seem to name the towns Baset and Buto, showing that Scorpion's armies had penetrated the Nile Delta. It may be that the conquests of Scorpion started the Egyptian hieroglyphic system by starting a need to keep records in writing.Secrets of Egypt, Channel 5 TV program 2/8, \\"Scorpion King,\\" 20 November 2008. In 1995, a 5,000-year-old graffito was discovered in the Theban Desert Road Survey that also bears the symbols of Scorpion and depicts his victory over another protodynastic ruler (possibly Naqada's king). The defeated king or place named in the graffito was \\"Bull's Head\\", a marking also found in U-j. It is believed that Scorpion I unified Upper Egypt following the defeat of Naqada's king. Scorpion's tomb is known in archaeology circles for its possible evidence of ancient wine consumption. In a search of the tomb, archaeologists discovered dozens of imported ceramic jars containing a yellow residue consistent with wine, dated to about 3150 BC. Chemical residues of herbs, tree resins, and other natural substances were found in the jars. Grape seeds, skins and dried pulp were also found in the tomb.

It is an independent self-regulatory body aspiring to build capacity in mosques, help deliver standards and ensure mosque personnel have a better understanding of British Muslims needs so that it can address any concerns more effectively. It works with and represents all Muslim traditions and schools of thought. Following the launch of the draft constitution in November 2007, there was a further process of consultation with representatives of mosques, Islamic centres, Imam training institutes, leaders and scholars. The consultation events took place in all the major cities in the UK and this work was undertaken by an interim steering group, composed of representatives from the four founder organisations: Al-Khoei Foundation, British Muslim Forum, Muslim Association of Britain and Muslim Council of Britain. MINAB now has over six hundred mosques and Islamic institutes as its members. It is a charity registered under the laws of England & Wales with an accountable system of representation. The MINAB will capacity build mosques through standards. It has five standards: # Members apply principles of good corporate governance # Members ensure that services are provided by suitably qualified and or experienced personnel # There are systems and processes in place to ensure that there are no impediments to the participation in the activities, including governance, for young people # There are systems and processes in place to ensure that there are no impediments to the participation in the activities, including governance, for women # Members ensure there are programmes that promote civic responsibility of Muslims in the wider society The process of self-certification is that the mosques will self-certify whether they fully meet or partially meet each of the above five standards. The MINAB will then randomly select 50% of the mosques who state that they fully meet the standard to assess how the organisation does so. If the assessment process highlights that the organisation does not meet the standard that it has self certified that it does, the MINAB will then support it through its capacity building programme. The body has been praised by some, like Communities Secretary Hazel Blears. Other have questioned its apparent links with the government.

It tells how the animals of the Bean Farm traveled to Florida and back again, and their adventures on the way. Plot summary Freddy was an intelligent pig that lived on the Bean Farm. To avoid the cold winter at their farm in Upstate New York, the animals decided to vacation in Florida. At first Charles the rooster is prevented from joining them by his acerbic wife, Henrietta. The animals encounter a man and a boy who wished to capture them. The animals scared them off. Later, Charles and Henrietta joined the group again. They also met the man and the boy, with the same results as last time. The animals were also joined by the man's black dog, Jack. They next passed through Washington, D.C. where three senators took them on a tour of the city. At the end of the tour, one of the senators made a speech on how pleased he was by the animals' visit. A few days later, while walking towards Florida, a thunderstorm forced the animals to take refuge in an empty log house. A flock of swallows mention a pile of gold in the area. The animals found the gold but were unable to take it with them, because they couldn't carry it. After meeting two men who tried to capture Hank, the old horse, and Mrs. Wiggins, a cow, the animals arrived at Florida only to get trapped on an island in a swamp by some alligators. After they escaped the alligators, the farm animals started the long trek northward. Their further adventures included disguising themselves to get past the two kidnappers, returning stolen property to some townspeople, taking the pile of gold with them on an old carriage, and taking the gold back from the man and the boy who tried to steal it before they got back to the Bean farm. Once they got to the farm, they showed Mr. and Mrs. Bean the gold and they all danced merrily. 1927 American novels American children's novels Pigs in literature Alfred A.

It was created by Parroty Interactive, which was a division of the game's publisher, Palladium Interactive. Star Warped was released in the United States and Canada, for both Windows PC and Macintosh, in late 1997 as a follow-up to their debut Myst parody, Pyst. The game is no longer in release, as Parroty's parent company folded after being bought by The Learning Company in 1998. The game invited players to \\"Be seduced by the power of the Dork Side\\". Star Warped received mixed reviews from critics: some praised the game's variety, originality, and humor, while others dismissed it as lazy, unfunny, and dull.  Plot and gameplay  The game is set in the Modesto, California, home of two die-hard Star Wars fans with a \\"Beavis and Butt-Head mentality\\": Brian (Brian Posehn) and Aaron (Robbie Rist). They claim to have never left their room since first watching the original Star Wars Trilogy. The two have compiled their \\"favorite snagged, borrowed and stolen\\" Star Wars merchandise, and the player can interact with these items. Gameplay primarily consists of a series of mini-games, including \\"Whack! the Ewok\\" and \\"Flawed Fighters\\", a spoof of fighting games such as Mortal Kombat. Characters include Leia I. Joe (a Princess Leia and G.I. Joe spoof), Cool-Handless Luke (Luke Skywalker with a missing hand and a pun on the film Cool Hand Luke), and Pizza-Flipping Greedo (Greedo as a pizza chef). The game also has several humorous items, such as \\"scrapped scripts\\", \\"gene splicer\\", and \\"Tell you, I Will\\". Clicking on items results in animations and minigames. The minigames also included \\"U Don't No Jedi\\", \\"Death Star Destructo\\", \\"X-Schwing\\", and \\"Dork Forces\\". According to GameSpots Helen Lee, Star Warped differs from Parroty's previous game Pyst in that it's a fully-fledged game instead of just an interactive product, and the parody trampled over all aspects of the Star Wars trilogy. As the game was released two years before Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace, it contains no parodies alluding to the prequel series; however, there are some fake references to the then-future movies. While spoofing the first three films in the Star Wars film series, the game also targets the extended Star Wars franchise, including its merchandise and marketing strategies.  Development  According to Palladium's then-vice president of marketing, Rob Halligan, the success of Pyst opened doors for future parody titles by the company, and Star Warped and The X-Fools (the latter a parody of The X-Files) were the first two they attempted. Once Palladium ironed out \\"legal entanglements\\", the company hoped to release the game in May 1997. Writers for the project included comedy veterans from Saturday Night Live, The Simpsons, Comedy Central, and The Jon Stewart Show. After the jokes were approved and the writing completed, the developers had the voice actors record dialogue and, afterwards, put the game information onto CDs made available for retail purchase by customers. The game features notable voice-acting talent in minor roles, including Tom Kenny, Carlos Alazraqui, Jodi Benson, Maurice LaMarche, and Kath Soucie. The game was also released in Germany with dubbed German voice acting.  Release and promotion  Star Warped was featured in a segment on the magazine-style program Splat! about cartoons in video games, which aired on animation specialty channel Teletoon. Following in the footsteps of Pyst, Star Warped had its own website players could access. After buying the game and registering, players were able to enter a member's-only section of the site, where new content was added until 1998. AllGame writer Christopher Michael Baker notes that even unregistered visitors to the website are still able to \\"check out and laugh at\\" some activities, minigames, and other content. An online-only quiz-themed minigame entitled \\"You Don't NoJedi\\" (a parody of You Don't Know Jack) was featured on the site, as a teaser for Star Warped. Bonus modules from Star Warped were featured on the CD for \\"Pyst Special Edition\\". In 1998, after Parroty's acquisition by The Learning Company, Palladium founder and chief executive officer Ed Bernstein said, \\"it was a fun business, but not terribly lucrative\\".  Critical reception  Star Warped received mixed reviews and polarized critics. Positive reviews highlighted the game's humor, originality, and gameplay, with some favorably comparing it to Parroty Interactive's previous title Pyst, which they viewed more as an interactive slideshow than a game. Negative reviews derided the game's humor, comparing it to cartoons like Family Guy and the Star Wars Holiday Special. Electric Games recommended the game for its \\"very, very funny\\" humor, \\"cartoony\\" graphics, \\"hammy\\" acting, \\"fun\\" gameplay, and \\"impressive . . . highly original\\" mini-games (praising the \\"Scrapped Scripts\\"). Doug Radcliffe of CD Mag praised one mini-game's \\"Pulp Fiction-style\\" script, but thought players would get bored after a few hours due to its lacking replay value. Christopher Michael Baker from All Game Guide deemed Star Warped the most\\"entertaining\\" of all Star Wars parody video games due to its variety of \\"fun\\", \\"great\\", and \\"hilarious\\" mini-games; the site also found the opportunity to delve into the personal belongings of the Star Wars super fans fascinating, deeming their collection \\"interesting\\" and \\"creative\\", and ultimately recommending the game for Star Wars fans. Additionally, America Onlines Huge Electronic Brain named the game the \\"Funniest CD-ROM of the Century\\". Joe Szadkowski of The Washington Post thought the game was \\"well worth\\" the $20 price tag, and reminded readers that the game was a parody, not to be taken seriously. Star Warped was the video game that Kill Screen writer Zach Koster credited the game for his decision to become a video game journalist. Emil Pagliarulo of The Adrenaline Vault saw Star Warped as an example of how Parroty Interactive made games that were \\"completely original simply by capitalizing on unoriginality\\", and said it \\"pokes fun at just about every Star Wars game ever made\\". A writer from CD Access described the game as \\"hilarious\\", offering hours of entertaining gameplay. Interpreting the game as a tribute to nerd culture, Steven L. Kent of The Seattle Times described Brian and Aaron as \\"charming\\" and noted the \\"eerie sense of reality\\" surrounding their collection of memorabilia, but felt that the mini-games were a \\"quick diversion\\", lacking depth. He thought that \\"Space Zap\\" and \\"Death Star Destructo\\" were the most enjoyable mini-games. Computer Gaming Magazine described Star Warped as a collection of mini-games, while Pyst was simply a \\"slideshow\\". Richard Cobblet of PC Gamer thought the game was \\"pretty bloody awful\\", \\"agonizing\\", \\"painful\\", \\"uninspired\\", and \\"lazy\\", and compared it unfavorably with the Star Wars Holiday Special, while accusing Parroty Interactive of producing a series of \\"comedy plague-pits\\". A writer from Entertainment Weekly gave the game a D, deeming it a \\"catastrophe\\" of lowbrow humor, low-rent mini-games, and criticizing the \\"irritating...obnoxious\\" protagonists' commentary. A reviewer from The Collection Chamber thought the video game was \\"unlicensed, unofficial and woefully unfunny\\". German review site PC Games gave the game 23 out of 100, commenting on the game's lack of a funny bone and \\"non-starter\\" gags; it recommended that PC Games readers save their money, and, instead, buy the Special Edition versions of Star Wars. Another German review site, ', compared Star Warped to Pyst, saying it offered more variety than the Myst parody, but noted that players would likely get bored after an hour of gameplay. It concluded with saying that the \\"modest\\" cost of the game was not worth the \\"cheap concoction\\", and that players were better off spending their money on the original Star Wars sextet.

Overview The two-masted wooden schooner was designed by A. Cary Smith and built in 1898 by the firm of A.C. Brown and Sons of Tottenville, New York. It was originally christened Uncas after the famous chief of the Mohegan tribe. Through various owners, the name was subsequently changed to Wal Gar, Bonnie Doone, and finally Diosa del Mar. In Lloyd's Register of American Yachts it appears as Bonnie Doone until finally disappearing from the registry in 1959 under the ownership of a Dr. Irving E. Laby in Los Angeles, California. The yacht was originally built as a staysail craft for the children of the wealthy Vanderbilt clan. As originally built she weighed 30 tons, was long, had a total sail area of , and a draft of . The Diosa was perfectly capable of deep ocean travel. Following the installation in 1916 of a Sterling gas engine, the vessel's capabilities were quite advanced. By 1925 she sported a full keel (modified from her original keel with auxiliary centerboard) and a GM Diesel engine. According to Lloyd's, the Diosa was burned and rebuilt in 1927. By 1951 she had been refitted with a six-cylinder Chrysler engine and was operating out of Newport Beach, California. In 1979 she won the Serena Cup as the fastest schooner in the Newport to Ensenada Race (California to Mexico). Subsequently, she sailed from Los Angeles to Hilo, Hawaii, where she operated as a charter until 1982 under the ownership of Roy Eugene \\"Gene\\" Deshler and Margo Deshler along with their two children Karen Smith and Stephen A. Smith. After returning to Los Angeles, she placed second in the Newport to Ensenada race of 1983. For most of the rest of her life she operated as a charter out of Long Beach, California. The yacht's demise came about near the end of the 10th annual Firemen's Race in 1990 off the coast of southern California. A small powerboat failed to spot the racing Diosa. The powerboat hove out of the Isthmus of Catalina, cutting in front of the doomed ship. Rather than risk injury or death to the driver and passengers on the smaller craft, Diosa's owner and captain Eddie Weinberg steered hard to starboard, crashing his ship against Ship Rock. The wreckage of the schooner was a favorite of divers for many years before finally breaking up beneath the waters of the Pacific Ocean. On July 2, 2012, captain Eddie Weinberg died at the Veterans Hospital in Long Beach. The salvaged stern and mast from the Diosa Del Mar was on display at the Isthmus on Catalina Island, California, for a number of years. Stern and mast at the Isthmus on Catalina Island, California. Ship Rock is located 3 miles east of the Isthmus on Catalina Island, California. Spot Where the Diosa del Mar Sank (Ship Rock) The salvage of the keel was done by Don and Ed Huseman. Diosa del Mar is located at . Ship Rock is located 3 miles east of the Isthmus on Catalina Island, California. Numerous people over the years, since the sinking of the Diosa Del Mar in 1990 had attempted to raise and salvage the keel of the boat. It took two attempts by the Huseman brothers, and about 17 trips to Catalina to move masts and debris in preparation to raise the keel off the rocks and reef, and towed to Long Beach Harbor, California. The eventual successful salvaging operation in 1996 was \\"the talk\\" of the maritime groups and the news media in the Los Angeles Basin, since there had been so many failed attempts over the years. The Huseman brother's first trip to Catalina Island in 1990 was to survey the keel wreckage and the placement in the rocks and reef at Ship Rock. They also discovered that the size of the keel was not as large as they had originally estimated. At first, they thought the keel would weigh about 100,000 lbs (50 tons), but after examining the keel during a dive, and making the calculations it turned out to be only about 40,000 pounds (20 tons). The salvage of the 20-ton keel was for the scrap lead value. On the first attempt to raise the keel, Gordon Frappier towed a by empty gas tank from the California mainland over to the wreck site next to Ship Rock, three miles from the Isthmus on Catalina Island. The reason the tank was used for lifting vs individual lift bags, was the tank was easier to control, and the least expensive means instead of using a multitude of lift bags for the 20-ton keel. After extensive preparations, the tank fitted with chains was floated and positioned over the keel. The tank was filled with water and submerged, then connected to the big turnbuckles and the bronze bolts sticking out of the top of the keel. The divers performed this connection at low tide, then waited for high tide to float the keel and the tank off the rocks, at about . When the tide came in, the surge was very strong, and the 20-ton keel and tank swayed back and forth. The bronze nuts on the keel didn't like to bend, and the keel studs broke off and the tank floated to the surface, thus ending their attempt. The second time they attempted to raise the keel, the same tank was used and the tide was not used for leverage. Ed Huseman positioned the tank over the keel and flooded the tank with water to submerge the tank, and then attached the tank to the keel. The next process was to blow out the water in the tank with the attached keel, and then the two would float to the surface. Ed Huseman figured out that hooking ten air tanks together, containing of air and attaching a garden hose from the air tanks to the tank's top valve, the air at the top would force the water out through the bottom of the tank. Ed Huseman's ingenious idea worked very well. The air blew the water out of a x tank in about 30 minutes. The keel and the tank floated up to about off the reef, however there were rocks about that blocked the exit movement of the keel. They tried to pull the tank and keel out one way, but the towboat, a Cal 39 sail boat with a Perkins 4108 50-hp diesel engine, skippered by Dan Cohen, was too far away to tell Cohen that the keel was still stuck in the rocks, and the tow rope snapped into two pieces. After being in the water for over nine hours that day, the four divers almost gave up. One of the divers, Steve Stiener, said they could move the keel, and they were able to push the tank with just flipper power. The divers all felt that the tank and keel were going to hit more rocks, however the keel and tank moved out of the rock and reef area, went through a bed of seaweed and into dark deep water, and floated to the water's surface. After the broken tow rope was repaired, Cohen started towing the tank and keel out of the rock and the reef area. The exhausted diving crew, after being in the water for two days, and the sailboats left Catalina Island elated, having achieved a successful salvage operation that no one else had been able to accomplish. The tank and 20-ton keel were then towed 24 miles by the Cal 39 Perkins 4108 50-hp diesel engine across the Catalina Channel to Long Beach Harbor. { Tank with attached keel on the water's surface.

Its range spans from the eastern tip of Hokkaid≈ç in Japan, via the Kuril Islands, the southern tip of the Kamchatka Peninsula and the Aleutian Arc to the Alaska Peninsula and Gulf of Alaska. The red-faced cormorant is closely related to the pelagic cormorant P. pelagicus, which has a similar range, and like the pelagic cormorant is placed by some authors (e.g. Johnsgaard) in a genus Leucocarbo. Where it nests alongside the pelagic cormorant, the red-faced cormorant generally breeds the more successfully of the two species, and it is currently increasing in numbers, at least in the easterly parts of its range. It is however listed as being of conservation concern, partly because relatively little is so far known about it. The adult bird has glossy plumage that is a deep greenish blue in color, becoming purplish or bronze on the back and sides. In breeding condition it has a double crest, and white plumes on the flanks, neck and rump, and the bare facial skin of the lores and around the eyes is a bright orange or red, giving the bird its name; although the coloration is less vivid outside the breeding season, the red facial skin is enough to distinguish it from the otherwise rather similar pelagic cormorant. Its legs and feet are brownish black. Its wings range from 25 to 29 cm in extent, with females having on average about 5 cm shorter wings. Adults weigh between 1.5 and 2.3 kg, with females averaging 350 g less than males. Analysis of stomach contents suggests that the red-faced cormorant is mainly a bottom feeder, taking cottids especially. Adults have few predators, though river otters may attempt to take them, as will corvids of various species, bald eagles and golden eagles. Gulls and corvids are common predators on eggs and chicks.

It is situated on the Chase Line. The station and all trains serving it are operated by West Midlands Trains. Unlike other stations on the Chase Line. Cannock station is located further from the town itself. It is actually much closer to the suburbs of Stoney Lea and Hawks Green. The station is over half a mile from the centre of town. History In 1854, the South Staffordshire Railway (SSR) obtained powers to build a branch to Cannock from Ryecroft Junction on its main line near Walsall; this was opened to passengers and goods on 1 February 1858 together with Cannock station. In 1855, the Cannock Mineral Railway (CMR) was authorised to connect this branch with the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) at Rugeley, this line was leased to the LNWR on 7 November 1859 and opened for passengers and goods at the same time. The SSR was leased to the LNWR in February 1861 and absorbed on 15 June 1867; the CMR being absorbed by the LNWR in 1869. The station was closed by British Railways on 18 January 1965. The station reopened by British Rail in 1989, as part of the first stage of the reopening to passenger trains of the Chase Line from Walsall to Hednesford. It had previously closed to passengers on 18 January 1965 and to goods on 10 August 1964, as part of the Beeching Axe. The remains of a small part of the original Up (southbound) platform can still be seen just to the north of the station and behind platform 1. Announcements were made in December 2018 for minor renovations of the station. \\"The plans include extending the platform, improving access, creating a 300-space car park, adding spaces for bikes and improving information points. The total cost is expected to be ¬£400,000, with ¬£129,000 being contributed from the joint Investment Fund agreed by Staffordshire County Council and ¬£40,000 from the West Midlands Rail Executive and West Midlands Trains.\\" Completion of electrification of the Chase line in May 2019 enabled an increased service frequency and speed of services from Cannock including a direct electric train service to London for the first time. Services Service frequencies vary depending on the time of day. Of the two southbound services per hour, one continues to London Euston and the other to Birmingham International. All northbound services terminate at Rugeley Trent Valley, apart from two services per day which terminate at Hednesford.

It is a large-scale, stopped wood flute pipe, usually with a leathered lip. The rank was invented by Robert Hope-Jones. Tibia Clausas provides the basic foundation tone of the organ with few overtones or harmonics. The Tibia Clausa is arguably the most important rank of pipes in a theatre pipe organ, with some organs having as many as 5. The stop shares similarities with the Bourdon and the Gedackt found in some church pipe organs. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Tibia Clausa was sometimes used as an alternate name for Doppelfl√∂te. Most tibias are made from wood, as by Wurlitzer etc., although examples of metal tibias may be found made by the John Compton Organ Company. The Tibia Clausa, or Tibia, is generally found at 16‚Ä≤, 8‚Ä≤, 4‚Ä≤ and 2‚Ä≤ pitches as a unified rank. The mutation ranks Tibia Quint 5‚Öì‚Ä≤, Twelfth 2‚Öî‚Ä≤ and Tierce 1‚Ä≤ are also drawn from this unified rank of 97 pipes. In some larger organs, a second Tibia rank may be present, extended to 1‚Ä≤ instead of 16‚Ä≤, allowing a 1‚Öì‚Ä≤ Nineteenth mutation and a 1‚Ä≤ Piccolo to be drawn from this rank. A few of the largest theatre organs, and some church organs, may have a separate 32‚Ä≤ Tibia Clausa rank of 12 pipes. In smaller organs, a Bourdon or Stopped Diapason may be substituted for a Tibia Clausa at 16‚Ä≤ pitch. The Tibia may be voiced on wind pressures from 10‚Ä≥ to 25‚Ä≥. The Tibia is generally used as a chorus stop, with or without tremulant; it is not normally used as a solo stop due to its relatively dull tone. Other variants of the Tibia Clausa include: Tibia Bass, Tibia Flute, Tibia Major, Tibia Plena (open tibia) and Tibia Rex.

It classifies individuals based on abilities in empathic thinking (E) and systematic thinking (S). It measures skills using an Empathy Quotient (EQ) and Systemizing Quotient (SQ) and attempts to explain the social and communication symptoms in autism spectrum disorders as deficits and delays in empathy combined with intact or superior systemizing. According to Baron-Cohen, the E‚ÄìS theory has been tested using the Empathy Quotient (EQ) and Systemizing Quotient (SQ), developed by him and colleagues, and generates five different 'brain types' depending on the presence or absence of discrepancies between their scores on E or S. E‚ÄìS profiles show that the profile E>S is more common in females than in males, and the profile S>E is more common in males than in females. Pdf. :Extracted in: :: Baron-Cohen and associates say the E‚ÄìS theory is a better predictor than gender of who chooses STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). Pdf. The E‚ÄìS theory has been extended into the extreme male brain (EMB) theory of autism and Asperger syndrome, which are associated in the E‚ÄìS theory with below-average empathy and average or above-average systemizing. Baron-Cohen's studies and theory have faced some criticism. Pdf. History E‚ÄìS theory was developed by psychologist Simon Baron-Cohen as a major reconceptualization of cognitive sex differences in the general population and in an effort to understand why the cognitive difficulties in autism appeared to lie in domains in which he says on average females outperformed males and why cognitive strengths in autism appeared to lie in domains in which on average males outperformed females. In the first chapter of his 2003 book The Essential Difference, he compares with the bestseller Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus, written by John Gray in 1992-3, and states: \\"the view that men are from Mars and women Venus paints the differences between the two sexes as too extreme. The two sexes are different, but are not so different that we cannot understand each other.\\" He had previously proposed the mind-blindness theory in 1985, which argued that children with autism are delayed in their development of a theory of mind, that is, the ability to understand the thoughts and feelings of themselves or others. Baron-Cohen says a strength of this theory lies in its power to explain one of the core features of autism (the social and communication difficulties), but a limitation of the mindblindness theory is that it ignored the other main domain in autism (unusually narrow interests and highly repetitive behaviors, also called 'resistance to change or need for sameness'). To address this, Baron-Cohen put forward the E‚ÄìS theory. Such a distinction can be traced back to two different but almost contemporary origins. On the one hand strictly epistemological, to the German historicism which, with Droysen, Dilthey, Windelband, and Rickert, formulated the separation between idiographic and nomothetic method, verstehen and erkl√§ren, Geisteswissenschaften and Naturwissenschaften, separation still subject to dispute until 1970 in the so-called Positivismusstreit between the Frankfurt School (Adorno, Habermas), supporter of the Kritische Theorie, and the Kritischer Rationalismus (Popper, Albert). On the other hand, strictly intersexual, to the gender essentialism according to Darwin's 1871 book The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex.Baron-Cohen, S. (2010) [2003]. Darwin. Research According to Baron-Cohen, females on average score higher on measures of empathy and males on average score higher on measures of systemizing. This has been found using the child and adolescent versions of the Empathy Quotient (EQ) and the Systemizing Quotient (SQ), which are completed by parents about their child/adolescent, Pdf. and on the self- report version of the EQ and SQ in adults. Pdf. Baron-Cohen and associates say that similar sex differences on average have been found using performance tests of empathy such as facial emotion recognition tasks Pdf. and on performance tests of systemizing such as measures of mechanical reasoning or 'intuitive physics'. Pdf. He also argues that these sex differences are not only due to socialization. Fetal testosterone While experience and socialization contribute to the observed sex differences in empathy and systemizing, Baron-Cohen and colleagues suggest that biology also plays a role. A candidate biological factor influencing E and S is fetal testosterone (FT). Pdf. FT levels are positively correlated with scores on the Systemizing Quotient Pdf. and are negatively correlated with scores on the Empathy Quotient A new field of research has emerged to investigate the role of testosterone levels in autism. Correlational research demonstrated that elevated rates of testosterone were associated with higher rates of autistic traits, lower rates of eye contact, and higher rates of other medical conditions. Furthermore, experimental studies showed that altering testosterone levels influences the maze performance in rats, having implications for human studies. The fetal testosterone theories posit that the level of testosterone in the womb influences the development of sexually dimorphic brain structures, resulting in sex differences and autistic traits in individuals. Pdf. :See also: ::  Evolutionary explanations for sex differences  Baron-Cohen presents several possible evolutionary psychology explanations for this sex difference. For example, he says that better empathizing may improve care of children, and that better empathy may also improve women's social network which may help in various ways with the caring of children. On the other hand, he says that systemizing may help males become good hunters and increase their social status by improving spatial navigation and the making and use of tools.  Extreme male brain theory of autism  Baron-Cohen's work in systemizing-empathizing led him to investigate whether higher levels of fetal testosterone explain the increased prevalence of autism spectrum disorders among males in his theory known as the \\"extreme male brain\\" theory of autism. A review of his book The Essential Difference published in Nature in 2003 summarizes his proposals as: \\"the male brain is programmed to systemize and the female brain to empathize ... Asperger's syndrome represents the extreme male brain\\". Baron-Cohen and colleagues extended the E‚ÄìS theory into the extreme male brain theory of autism, which hypothesizes that autism shows an extreme of the typical male profile. This theory divides people into five groups: *Type E, whose empathy is at a significantly higher level than their systemizing (E > S). *Type S, whose systemizing at a significantly higher level than their empathy (S > E). *Type B (for balanced), whose empathy is at the same level as their systemizing (E = S). *Extreme Type E, whose empathy is above average but whose systemizing is below average (E ‚â´ S). *Extreme Type S, whose systemizing is above average but whose empathy is below average (S ‚â´ E). Baron-Cohen says that tests of the E‚ÄìS model show that twice as many females than males are Type E and twice as many males than females are Type S. 65% of people with autism spectrum conditions are Extreme Type S. The concept of the Extreme Type E brain has been proposed; however, little research has been conducted on this brain profile. Apart from the research using EQ and SQ, several other similar tests also have found female and male differences and that people with autism or Asperger syndrome on average score similarly to but more extremely than the average male. For example, the brain differences model provides a broad overview of sex differences that are represented in individuals with autism, including brain structures and hormone levels. Some, but not all, studies have found that brain regions that differ in average size between males and females also differ similarly between people who have autism and those who do not have autism.Baron-Cohen, Simon (2010), \\"Empathizing, systemizing, and the extreme male brain theory of autism\\", Pdf. Baron-Cohen's research on relatives of people with Asperger syndrome and autism found that their fathers and grandfathers are twice as likely to be engineers as the general population. Baron-Cohen's studies have been questioned. The overrepresentation of engineers could depend on a sampling bias. Natural science students have more relatives with autism than humanities students. Another similar finding by Baron-Cohen in California has been referred to as the Silicon Valley phenomenon, where a large portion of the population works in technical fields, and he says autism prevalence rates are ten times higher than the average of the US population. These data suggest that genetics and the environment play a role in autism prevalence, and children with technically minded parents are therefore more likely to be diagnosed with autism. Another possibility has been proposed that spins the perspective of the extreme male brain. Social theorists have been investigating the concept that females have protective factors against autism by having a more developed language repertoire and more empathy skills. Female children speak earlier and use language more than their male counterparts, and the lack of this skill translates into many symptoms of autism, offering another explanation for the discrepancy in prevalence. =Development of brain structures= The fetal testosterone theory hypothesizes that higher levels of testosterone in the amniotic fluid of mothers push brain development towards improved ability to see patterns and analyze complex systems while diminishing communication and empathy, emphasizing \\"male\\" traits over \\"female\\", or in E‚ÄìS theory terminology, emphasizing \\"systemizing\\" over \\"empathizing\\". This theory states that fetal testosterone influences the development of certain structures in the brain, and that these changes relate to behavioral traits seen in those with autism. Males generally have higher levels of fetal testosterone contributing to their brain developing in that particular way. The extreme male brain theory (EMB), put forward by Baron-Cohen suggests that autistic brains show an exaggeration of the features associated with male brains. These are mainly size and connectivity with males generally having a larger brain with more white matter, leading to increased connectivity in each hemisphere. This is seen in an exaggerated form in the brains of those with ASD. Another feature of male brains is having a smaller corpus callosum in at least some regions leading to decreased inter-hemispheric connectivity. This is also seen in those with ASD. Individuals with ASD were found to have widespread interconnectivity abnormalities in specific brain regions. This could explain the different results on empathy tests between men and women as well as the deficiencies in empathy seen in ASD as empathy requires several brain regions to be activated which need information from many different areas of the brain. A further example of how brain structure can influence ASD is looking at cases where the corpus callosum does not fully develop (agenesis of corpus callosum). It was found that autism is commonly diagnosed in children where the corpus callosum does not fully develop (45% of children with agenesis of the corpus callosum). :See also: :: A further example of brain structures relating to ASD is that children with ASD tend to have a larger amygdala, this is another example of being an extreme version of the male brain which generally has a larger amygdala. These brain differences have all been shown to have an influence on social cognition and communication. High levels of fetal testosterone have also been shown to be related to behavior associated with autism, such as eye contact. Studies examining the relationship between prenatal testosterone levels and autistic traits found that high levels correlated with traits such as decreased eye contact. These were present in both sexes. This suggests that fetal testosterone (fT) is the cause of sex differences in the brain and that there is a link between fT levels and ASD. In general females with autism have a higher rate of medical conditions which are related to high androgen levels and both males and females with autism have higher than average androgen levels. Males have higher fT levels naturally meaning that there is less of a change required in the hormone levels to reach a point high enough to cause the developmental changes seen in autism. This is a possible cause for the male prevalence seen in autism. Imprinted brain theory The imprinted brain theory is a somewhat similar although not identical theory. It argues that autism and psychosis are contrasting disorders on a number of variables. This is argued to be due to imbalanced genomic imprinting. According to the imprinted brain theory there could be a mismatch and more severe problems when extreme genomic imprinting occurs in the opposite sex, which would explain why female autism (and male psychosis) is often particularly severe, which is a problem for the \\"extreme male brain\\" theory which predicts the opposite. Cognitive versus affective empathy Empathy can be subdivided into two major components: * cognitive empathy (also termed 'mentalizing'), the ability to understand another's mental state; * affective or emotional empathy, the ability to emotionally respond to another's mental states. Affective empathy can be subdivided into personal distress (self-centered feelings of discomfort and anxiety in response to another's suffering) and empathic concern (sympathy towards others that are suffering). Pdf. :See also: :: Studies found that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) self-report lower levels of empathic concern, show less or absent comforting responses toward someone who is suffering, and report equal or higher levels of personal distress compared to controls. The combination of reduced empathic concern and increased personal distress may lead to the overall reduction of empathy in ASD. Studies also suggest that individuals with ASD may have impaired theory of mind, involving the ability to understand the perspectives of others. Pdf. The terms cognitive empathy and theory of mind are often used synonymously, but due to a lack of studies comparing theory of mind with types of empathy, it is unclear whether these are equivalent. Notably, many reports on the empathic deficits of individuals with Asperger syndrome are actually based on impairments in theory of mind. Baron-Cohen argued that psychopathy is associated with intact cognitive empathy but reduced affective empathy while ASD is associated with both reduced cognitive and affective empathy. Criticism Empathizing- systematizing theory has faced some criticism. Time magazine wrote that Baron- Cohen \\"most dramatically wandered into fraught territory in 2003, when he published the book The Essential Difference, which called autism a manifestation of an extreme 'male brain'--one that's 'predominantly hard-wired for understanding and building systems,' as opposed to a 'female brain,' one that's 'predominantly hard-wired for empathy'--and ended up on the wrong side of the debate on science and sex differences.\\" A book review published in the journal Nature, wrote: > \\"The idea that males are more interested in systemizing than females merits > serious consideration ... It is unquestionably a novel and fascinating idea > that seems likely to generate a rich empirical body of literature as its > properties are tested. The second part of the theory‚Äîthat females are more > empathic than males‚Äîis more problematic ... Other measures, however, show > that males are highly socially skilled.\\" Others criticize the original EQ and SQ, which form most of the research basis behind the notions of empathizing and systemizing. Both measure more than one factor, and sex differences exist on only some of the factors. Other critics argue that the work has focused only on higher-functioning individuals with autism spectrum disorders, and requires independent replication with broader samples. Isabelle Rapin and Helen Tager-Flusberg said about the theory; > Isabelle Rapin ... finds Dr. Baron-Cohen's theory \\"provocative\\" but adds > that \\"it does not account for some of the many neurological features of the > disorder, like the motor symptoms [such as repetitive movements and > clumsiness], the sleep problems or the seizures.\\" Others worry that the term > \\"extreme male brain\\" could be misinterpreted. Males are commonly associated > with \\"qualities such as aggression,\\" says Helen Tager-Flusberg ... \\"What's > dangerous is that's the inference people will make: Oh, these are extreme > males.\\" This theory has been described by psychologist Cordelia Fine as \\"neurosexism\\". The 2017 book Inferior: How Science Got Women Wrong and the New Research That‚Äôs Rewriting the Story by Angela Saini develops a \\"take-down\\" of the sex differences research from Baron-Cohen and his colleagues, who carry on Darwin's \\"idea that man and woman...evolved to meet their roles of hunter and gatherer, respectively.\\" Another neuroscientist, Gina Rippon, opposes his theories on her book The Gendered Brain: The new neuroscience that shatters the myth of the female brain. She has criticized Baron-Cohen works, cataloguing his book The Essential Difference as \\"neurotrash\\" because of its weak research methods. Reviewing her work for Nature, neuroscientist Lise Eliot has supported Rippon's approach, arguing \\"The hunt for male and female distinctions inside the skull is a lesson in bad research practice\\". Rippon also argues against using \\"male\\" and \\"female\\" for describing different types of brains which do not correspond to genders.

Prior to this flag, Vancouver had a different municipal flag which was the result of a contest held in 1978, with the winning entry submitted by Rudolph Danglemaier. The flag featured a white Canadian pale flanked by a green stripe on the hoist side, and a blue stripe on the fly side. The shield, helmet, mantling and crest from the city arms were placed in the centre of the flag.

It has the general form: :M1‚ÄìR + M2‚ÄìR‚Ä≤ ‚Üí M1‚ÄìR‚Ä≤ + M2‚ÄìR where R and R‚Ä≤ can be, but are not limited to, an alkyl, aryl, alkynyl, allyl, halogen, or pseudo-halogen group. The reaction is usually an irreversible process due to thermodynamic and kinetic reasons. Thermodynamics will favor the reaction based on the electronegativities of the metals and kinetics will favor the reaction if there are empty orbitals on both metals. There are different types of transmetalation including redox-transmetalation and redox- transmetalation/ligand exchange. During transmetalation the metal-carbon bond is activated, leading to the formation of new metal-carbon bonds. Transmetalation is commonly used in catalysis, synthesis of main group complexes, and synthesis of transition metal complexes. Types of transmetalation There are two main types of transmetalation, redox- transmetalation (RT) and redox-transmetalation/ligand-exchange (RTLE). Below, M1 is usually a 4d or 5d transition metal and M2 is usually a main group or 3d transition metal. By looking at the electronegativities of the metals and ligands, one can predict whether the RT or RTLE reaction will proceed and what products the reaction will yield. For example, one can predict that the addition of 3 HgPh2 to 2 Al will yield 3 Hg and 2 AlPh3 because Hg is a more electronegative element than Al. =Redox-transmetalation= : M1n+‚ÄìR + M2 ‚Üí M1 \\\\+ M2n+‚ÄìR. In redox-transmetalation a ligand is transferred from one metal to the other through an intermolecular mechanism. During the reaction one of the metal centers is oxidized and the other is reduced. The electronegativities of the metals and ligands is what causes the reaction to go forward. If M1 is more electronegative than M2, it is thermodynamically favorable for the R group to coordinate to the less electronegative M2. =Redox-transmetalation/ligand-exchange= : M1‚ÄìR + M2‚ÄìX ‚Üí M1‚ÄìX + M2‚ÄìR. In redox-transmetalation/ligand exchange the ligands of two metal complexes switch places with each other, bonding with the other metal center. The R ligand can be an alkyl, aryl, alkynyl, or allyl group and the X ligand can be a halogen, pseudo-halogen, alkyl, or aryl group. The reaction can proceed by two possible intermediate steps. The first is an associative intermediate, where the R and X ligands bridge the two metals, stabilizing the transition state. The second and less common intermediate is the formation of a cation where R is bridging the two metals and X is anionic. The RTLE reaction proceeds in a concerted manner. Like in RT reactions, the reaction is driven by electronegativity values. The X ligand is attracted to highly electropositive metals. If M1 is a more electropositive metal than M2, it is thermodynamically favorable for the exchange of the R and X ligands to occur. Applications =Cross-coupling reactions= Transmetalation is often used as a step in the catalytic cycles of cross-coupling reactions. Some of the cross-coupling reactions that include a transmetalation step are Stille cross- coupling, Suzuki cross-coupling, Sonogashira cross-coupling, and Negishi cross-coupling. The most useful cross-coupling catalysts tend to be ones that contain palladium. Cross-coupling reactions have the general form of R‚Ä≤‚ÄìX + M‚ÄìR ‚Üí R‚Ä≤‚ÄìR + M‚ÄìX and are used to form C‚ÄìC bonds. R and R‚Ä≤ can be any carbon fragment. The identity of the metal, M, depends on which cross-coupling reaction is being used. Stille reactions use tin, Suzuki reactions use boron, Sonogashira reactions use copper, and Negishi reactions use zinc. The transmetalation step in palladium catalyzed reactions involve the addition of an R‚ÄìM compound to produce an R‚Ä≤‚ÄìPd‚ÄìR compound. Cross-coupling reactions have a wide range of applications in synthetic chemistry including the area of medicinal chemistry. The Stille reaction has been used to make an antitumor agent, (¬±)-epi-jatrophone; the Suzuki reaction has been used to make an antitumor agent, oximidine II; the Sonogashira reaction has been used to make an anticancer drug, eniluracil; and the Negishi reaction has been used to make the carotenoid Œ≤-carotene via a transmetalation cascade. :Figure 1. Synthesis of Œ≤-carotene by Negishi cross-coupling and transmetalation cascades. =Lanthanides= Lanthanide organometallic complexes have been synthesized by RT and RTLE. Lanthanides are very electropositive elements. Organomercurials, such as HgPh2, are common kinetically inert RT and RTLE reagents that allow functionalized derivatives to be synthesized, unlike organolithiums and Grignard reagents. Diarylmercurials are often used to synthesize lanthanide organometallic complexes. Hg(C6F5)2 is a better RT reagent to use with lanthanides than HgPh2 because it does not require a step to activate the metal. However, phenyl-substituted lanthanide complexes are more thermally stable than the pentafluorophenyl complexes. The use of HgPh2 led to the synthesis of a ytterbium complex with different oxidation states on the two Yb atoms: :Yb(C10H8)(THF)2 \\\\+ HgPh2 ‚Üí YbIIYbIIIPh5(THF)4 In the Ln(C6F5)2 complexes, where Ln = Yb, Eu, or Sm, the Ln‚ÄìC bonds are very reactive, making them useful in RTLE reactions. Protic substrates have been used as a reactant with the Ln(C6F5)2 complex as shown: Ln(C6F5)2 \\\\+ 2LH ‚Üí Ln(L)2 \\\\+ 2C6F5H. It is possible to avoid the challenges of working with the unstable Ln(C6F5)2 complex by forming it in situ by the following reaction: :Ln + HgR2 \\\\+ 2 LH ‚Üí Ln(L)2 \\\\+ Hg + 2 RH Organotins are also kinetically inert RT and RTLE reagents that have been used in a variety of organometallic reactions. They have applications to the synthesis of lanthanide complexes, such as in the following reaction: :Yb + Sn(N(SiMe3)2)2 ‚Üí Yb(N(SiMe3)2)2 \\\\+ Sn =Actinides= RT can be used to synthesize actinide complexes. RT has been used to synthesize uranium halides using uranium metal and mercury halides as shown: :U + HgX ‚Üí UX + Hg (X = Cl, Br, I) This actinide RT reaction can be done with multiple mercury compounds to coordinate ligands other than halogens to the metal: :2 U + 3 (C5H5)2Hg + HgCl2 ‚Üí 2 (C5H5)3UCl + 4 Hg =Alkaline earth metals= Alkaline earth metal complexes have been synthesized by RTLE, employing the same methodology used in synthesizing lanthanide complexes. The use of diphenylmercury in alkaline-earth metal reactions leads to the production of elemental mercury. The handling and disposal of elemental mercury is challenging due to its toxicity to humans and the environment. This led to the desire for an alternative RTLE reagent that would be less toxic and still very effective. Triphenylbismuth, BiPh3, was discovered to be a suitable alternative. Mercury and bismuth have similar electronegativity values and behave similarly in RTLE reactions. BiPh3 has been used to synthesize alkaline-earth metal amides and alkaline-earth metal cyclopentadienides. The difference between HgPh2 and BiPh3 in these syntheses was that the reaction time was longer when using BiPh3.

Early life Anderson was raised in Alton, Illinois. When Anderson was a teenager, his father died of a heart attack and his mother remarried.Cary Spivak, \\"Young Anderson 'was just another kid'\\". Milwaukee Sentinel, April 28, 1992 at A5. He attended Alton High School and graduated in 1975. In 1984, he graduated with a degree in Business Administration from Elmhurst College. On March 30, 1985, he married Barbara E. Lynch in Chicago. Prior to his arrest for murder, the Andersons lived in Cedarburg, Wisconsin, with their three young children.\\"Handcuffed suspect views open casket.\\" Milwaukee Sentinel, April 28, 1992 at A1. He was treasurer of the Lions Club and did volunteer work at the Divine Word Catholic Church. Killing of his wife On April 21, 1992, the Anderson couple went to a movie and dinner at a T.G.I. Friday's outside the Northridge Mall in northwest Milwaukee. After dinner, Jesse stabbed Barbara five times in the face and head, and then stabbed himself four times in the chest, though most of his wounds were superficial. Barbara went into a coma and died from her wounds two days later. Anderson blamed two African-American men for attacking him and his wife. He presented police with a Los Angeles Clippers basketball cap he claimed to have knocked off the head of one of the assailants. When details of the crime were made public, a university student told police Anderson had purchased the hat from him a few days earlier. According to employees at a military surplus store, the red-handled fishing knife that was used to murder Barbara was sold to Anderson a few weeks earlier. Police stated that the store was the only one in Milwaukee that sold that type of knife. On April 29, Anderson was charged with murder. On August 13, he was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for 60 years. Death On the morning of November 28, 1994, while imprisoned at Columbia Correctional Institution, Anderson and serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer were left unattended while cleaning a restroom at the prison gymnasium with fellow inmate Christopher Scarver. Scarver reported that he was \\"disgusted\\" by a newspaper report detailing Dahmer's crimes against black people, and had previously pleaded an insanity defense at his 1992 trial where he told a psychiatrist, \\"Nothing white people do is just\\". In a 2015 blog post, Scarver disputed some of these statements. After a confrontation with Dahmer and Anderson, Scarver retrieved a steel bar from the weight room, followed Dahmer to the locker room, and struck him in the head. He then tracked down Anderson and bludgeoned him as well. Dahmer was declared dead about one hour after the attack, and Anderson died two days later, when doctors at the University of Wisconsin Hospital in Madison removed him from life support.

For Pope Sixtus IV, Bettini may have travelled to France (1474) and Germany (1481). He retired to his original convent in Siena in 1486 and died a year later. Bettini was revered by later biographers and sometimes referred to as \\"Beato\\" (Blessed) (a step toward canonization), but this designation was never church-sanctioned. Bettini was known as a prolific writer. His Monte Santo di Dio (1477) described how one could use science and virtue to reach closer to God. This work, printed in Florence by Nicolaus Laurentii is especially notable in that it is possibly the first printed work to contain copper plate engravings.

The state forest covers more than of mountain ridges, gorges, and old-growth forests at elevations ranging from around 600 to 2,080 feet. It is managed by the Department of Conservation and Recreation. History The forest is named for the old Mohawk Trail (now Massachusetts Route 2), a Native American footpath that connected the Hudson and Connecticut River valleys. The forest was created in 1921 when the state purchased acreage for the express purpose of preserving the area's scenic beauty and historic associations. Two Civilian Conservation Corps camps were established here in the 1930s. Their contributions included the construction of an administration building and four rental cabins and the expansion of a campground built in the 1920s by the state. Natural features The forest is crossed by two main rivers, the Deerfield River and the Cold River. Several small streams support various species of trout. Other wildlife that may be seen include deer, bobcats, and black bears. ;Old growth and tall (2nd growth) trees Mohawk Trail State Forest is specifically known for its tall trees. A total of of the state forest is classified as pre-settlement old growth by researchers. Trees approaching 500 years in age have been confirmed. Most of the extremely old trees are Eastern hemlock. Other species reaching significant age include yellow and black birch, sugar maple, red spruce, and northern red oak. Specimens of examples of all these species exceed 300 years in age and numerous trees of a dozen species surpass 200 years. Trees over 150 years old in Mohawk are very common. In addition to the old growth, Mohawk Trail State Forest contains many of the tallest trees in Massachusetts as verified by the Eastern Native Tree Society. Most of these tallest trees are between 100 and 200 years old and are properly classified as second growth. Among the tall tree species, the white pine stands supreme. As of the end of the 2011 growing season, 122 eastern white pines had been measured to heights of 150 feet or more and 14 surpass . The tallest accurately measured single tree as tracked by the Eastern Native Tree Society in the New England grows in Mohawk and measured in height at the end of the 2011 growing season. The tree is named for Mohawk dignitary, the late Chief Jake Swamp. Of public properties in the Northeast, only Cook Forest State Park in Pennsylvania rivals Mohawk Trail State Forest in the and over height class. The present count for Cook Forest as determined by the Eastern Native Tree Society and the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources is 112. The Eastern Native Tree Society maintains records of all white pines in the Northeast confirmed to a height of 150 feet or more. In addition to the white pine, the white ash also reaches to heights of in Mohawk Trail State Forest. Two trees have been measured to over 150 feet and around 20 surpass in height. Altogether, 7 native species exceed 130 feet,12 native species exceed , and 20 native species exceed in height. Of the tall tree champions for Massachusetts, Mohawk Trail State Forest currently boasts 18 champions. However, many of these champion trees are not conspicuously large in girth. They have grown exceptionally tall in the rich, moist, protected ravines of the central Berkshires. Note that what is being described are champion tall trees, which are not to be confused with official state champion trees. The latter are based on weighted measurements of girth, height, and crown spread to arrive at composite scores suggestive of overall size. The national champion sugar maple listed in the National Register of Big Trees grows in the State Forest. The Mahican-Mohawk Trail and the colonial Mohawk Trail road to the lower meadows both pass through some of the tallest of the pines. The Mahican-Mohawk Recreational Trail passes through some of the old growth as it climbs the Todd-Clark Ridge on the north side. Activities and amenities The park features wooded campsites and rental cabins, trails for hiking, walking, and cross-country skiing, and a day-use area with swimming pool and picnic area. The forest also offers fishing, canoeing, interpretive programs, and restricted hunting.

As a comedic device, it often dramatizes and draws attention to life in the ghetto. For example, in the motion picture B*A*P*S (or Black American Princesses), the protagonists pretend to belong to an upper-economic class, but in reality they live a lifestyle that is full of superficial glamour.New York Times Ghetto fabulous style has moved into the mainstream along with hip-hop and rap music icons adopting the style though sometimes calling the fashion \\"uptown couture\\" with common \\"ghetto fabulous\\" styles mixed with couture labels, including new upscale/designer labels created by hip-hop moguls including Sean Combs, Jay-Z, and Kimora Lee Simmons.VibeNew York TimesChicago Tribune The phrase has also been the title of several rap albums and songs including Mystikal's 1998 album Ghetto Fabulous, Fabolous's 2001 album, Ghetto Fabolous and the Ras Kass' song \\"Ghetto Fabulous\\". Cultural context The origin of ghetto fabulousness fits into a larger cultural trend of the time. During the 1990s, Black, urban fashion was becoming a hot commodity through the rise of ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù rap. The music of the inner city black male filled radios and television screens with images of inner city life and their daily struggles. In a society of iconic images, the image of the ghetto fabulous woman started to form. Many of the images in music videos were centered on young women and their hyper-sexualized bodies while the ‚Äúmedia turn[ed] girls into spectacles‚àívisual objects on display‚Ä¶ as in fabulous‚Äù. Because of the circumstances of many inner city families, poverty and consumerism became the focal point of artistic expression. With the rise of malls in the 1980s, this could be seen in the larger cultural context as well. ‚ÄúExcessive consumerism and an obsession with bling are certainly not confined to any particular demographic. We are a nation of excess and instant gratification. It has become the American way‚Äù. For inner city youth, the ghetto fabulous life was about trying to outrun their socio-economic situations. For centuries, fashion has represented socio- economic status, so lower classes will buy outside their means in order to try and fit into an image of the upper classes. This mentality of buying outside ones means contrasted many attitudes of earlier generations. Parents and grandparents did not have the culture of overnight success and YouTube sensations. They learned that you must work for what you want. ‚ÄúAs the literal and figurative daughter of postfeminists, the current girl inherits the desire to ‚Äòhave it all,‚Äô while embracing (unlike her mother, with no angst) both girl power independence and persistent commodity consumption that puts her sexualized body and self on display\\". The materiality and mentality of being ghetto fabulous go hand-in-hand. You have to have the mind to buy the right items, and those items in return help maintain the mentality of extravagance. Common assumptions Uses and interpretations of the term vary. For instance, a person who is living \\"ghetto fabulous\\" lives above their means, sometimes with means of support other than legitimate work. Money and housing may come from welfare assistance, relatives, or illicit activities. However, the person is not considered poor. In fact the person may appear well-to-do. Frequently, the term is used in reference to a person's material possessions such as a luxury car, brand-label clothing and accessories, or jewelry. The term may also reference personal grooming habits such as having one's hair and nails done, being tattooed, or having cosmetic platinum, gold or silver caps applied to the teeth. While the term \\"ghetto fabulous\\" may be used to specifically point to any of the above, it is most frequently used a generalization, e.g., \\"s/he is living (a) ghetto fabulous (life).\\" Buying from and vibrantly displaying designer brands such as Louis Vuitton and Gucci traditionally go hand-in-hand with the trend. Many have gone as far as to customize the exterior and interior of their cars to be coated in the Louis Vuitton design, and Gucci Mane's stage name is likely a by-product of ghetto fabulous culture depending on the geographic location e.g. Los Angeles, Houston, Miami.New York ObserverVH1  See also  * Black American princess * Bling-bling * Puttin' on the Ritz * Welfare queen References African-American culture African-American slang Class-related slurs Stereotypes of African Americans Stereotypes of the working class Stereotypes of urban people ","title":"Ghetto fabulous"},{"id":"5750842","title":"1976 Wimbledon Championships"},{"id":"5750856","text":"The Last of the Wine is Mary Renault's first novel set in ancient Greece, the setting that would become her most important arena. The novel was published in 1956 and is the second of her works to feature male homosexuality as a major theme. It was a bestseller within the gay community. The book is a portrait of Athens at the close of the Golden Age and the end of the Peloponnesian War with Sparta, and includes Socrates as a character. Plot summary The novel is narrated by Alexias, a noble Athenian youth, who becomes a noted beauty in the city and a champion runner. The novel suggests that young male Athenians were treated almost like modern debutantes and wooed by older men seeking to be their lovers; in fact, in a memorable passage, Alexias' father, Myron, himself a former beauty and champion athlete, writes to his son before leaving Athens for the Sicilian Expedition. The father imparts to the son the traits he should seek in a lover ‚Äì qualities like honor, loyalty and courage. However, the father also warns the son not to become involved with women as he is much too young. (See Athenian pederasty.) As an ephebe (adolescent male), Alexias falls in love with Lysis, a man in his 20s ‚Äì a champion wrestler and a student of Socrates. The novel follows their relationship through the Peloponnesian War, the surrender of Athens, the establishment of the Thirty Tyrants rule over Athens, the democratic rebellion of Thrasybulus and shortly after. The story ends with first hints of the eventual trial of Socrates for teaching blasphemy and sowing social disorder. From the beginning of the novel, Socrates figures prominently; both Alexias and Lysis become his students in their youth. Socrates was very prominent around the city, always talking to new people. Also characterized in the novel are Plato and several figures from his Dialogues who were Socrates' students, including Xenophon, Crito and Phaedo. Another historical figure who figures in the story, albeit mostly off-stage, is Alcibiades, the Athenian general who flees Athens on a charge of sacrilege and functions as a military adviser to Sparta until he is recalled by a resurgent democracy in Athens. Alexias and Lysis serve under Alcibiades' command until his carelessness leads the fleet to disaster and he once again goes into exile. In the course of the novel, Lysis falls in love with and marries a woman who sees Alexias favorably and encourages the continuation of her husband's relationship with him. Not long after this, Athens is defeated by Sparta in the Peloponnesian War. Alexias' conservative father is murdered under the Spartan-installed tyranny known as The Thirty. Alexias and Lysis go to Thebes, joining Thrasybulus when he leads a force of exiles to liberate Athens. Lysis is killed in the battle between the Long Walls running from the port of Piraeus to Athens (the Battle of Munychia). Shortly after the victory, Alexias takes Lysis' widow under his protection, marries her and continues his family line. The book ends with the postscript that this story (incomplete and long-forgotten) has been found by Alexias' grandson (also named Alexias), a commander of Athenian cavalry in the service of Alexander the Great. Major themes The Last of the Wine engages the mores and culture of Classical Greece, including symposia (drinking parties), the treatment of women, the importance of athletic, military and philosophical training among young men, marriage customs, and daily life in war and peace.

In 1948, Goldstein announced that he had discovered the manuscript of a symphony by Ovsianiko-Kulikovsky in the archives of the theater in Odessa. The G minor work, numbered 21, was said to have been written in 1809; it bore the inscription \\"for the dedication of the Odessa Theater\\". The discovery caused a great deal of excitement in Soviet musical circles, for it was seen as proof that Russia had been able to produce a symphonist of comparable stature to Joseph Haydn. Furthermore, the symphony contained Ukrainian folk songs and ended with a Cossack dance, showing that the composer had a nationalist awareness. This piece was subsequently proven to be a fake.Taruskin, Richard (1996). Stravinsky and the Russian Traditions: A Biography of the Works Through Mavra, p. 161. University of California Press, Association for Recorded Sound Collection (1994). ARSC Journal, Volume 25, pp. 42-43. Description #Adagio ‚Äì Allegro (G minor) #Romance. Adagio (G major) #Minuet (G minor, with trio in G major) #Finale. Kazachok (G major) Purported composer Little is known about Ovsianiko-Kulikovsky's life besides his dates of birth (1768) and death (1846). A native of Kherson Oblast, he is known to have been a landowner and patron of the arts; in 1810 he presented his orchestra of serfs to the Odessa Theater. No evidence has yet come to light to suggest that he was active as a composer. He was the grandfather of the linguist Dmitri Ovsianiko-Kulikovsky. Hoax discovery The piece was performed in Odessa and in Kiev in 1949, and was published by the state music publishers in 1951. It was also quickly recorded for Melodiya by Yevgeny Mravinsky, and was soon the subject of treatises by two Soviet musicologists. One of the musicologists to study the work was a composer and Kiev conservatory professor named Gleb Taranov, who was asked to examine the manuscript of the symphony. Upon completing his examination, he concluded that neither Ovsianiko-Kulikovsky nor Mikhail Goldstein had written the symphony. Goldstein, however, stated that the symphony was in fact his own work. He had been stung when a communist party functionary savaged his use of Ukrainian themes in one of his own pieces, claiming that as a Jew he could not understand Ukrainian culture and had no right to use it in his music. When Goldstein replied that Beethoven also made use of Ukrainian themes in his \\"Razumovsky Quartets\\" the functionary said bluntly that \\"Beethoven was not a Jew.\\" The symphony, then, was written as an act of revenge, to prove that he could, in fact, write \\"Ukrainian\\" music. Vsevolod Ch–∞govets, a philosemitic Ukrainian musician-friend of his, made the suggestion to ascribe the symphony to \\"Ovsianniko-Kulikovsky\\". Goldstein was branded a liar and a traitor to Soviet culture for his actions; in 1964 he emigrated from Ukraine to West Germany. He spent his remaining years teaching and working as a musicologist in Germany. The hoax was not acknowledged in some later publications. The work continues to be taught in courses on Ukrainian music at the major conservatories in Ukraine.

Five years of training in an Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) program, along with the successful completion of both a written and oral exam is required to achieve certification. Mission The mission of the American Board of Otolaryngology (ABOto) is to assure that, at the time of certification and recertification, diplomates certified by the ABOto have met the ABOto's professional standards of training and knowledge in otolaryngology - head and neck surgery. The ABOto's fiduciary responsibility is to the public. Although the ABOto carefully considers the concerns of and impact on our diplomates, it is what is in the public's best interest that guides the ABOto's decision making process. Meaning of certification While licensure by the individual states sets the minimum competency requirements to practice medicine, it is not specialty specific. Board certification is a voluntary program in which specialists seek to improve their performance and demonstrate a commitment to their profession. Board-certified otolaryngologists must meet the ABOto training requirements, pass psychometrically validated examinations, and participate in Maintenance of Certification. The ABOto views certification as not just passing the examinations, but a continuum beginning with entry into training and ends with retirement. In order to be eligible to take the certification examinations, candidates must be registered with the ABOto Resident Registry by their Program Director at the beginning of their training, which includes verification of graduation from medical school. The Program Director provides the ABOto with an annual evaluation of each resident and determines whether the resident should receive credit for completion of that year of training. Applicants are required to have completed an ACGME- accredited residency and receive approval from their Program Director to sit for the examinations. The online application process must be completed by the appropriate deadlines, which allows time for the information to be verified. History (adapted from the \\"American Board of Otolaryngology 1924‚Äì1999\\" by Robert W. Cantrell, MD and Jerome C. Goldstein, MD) The first formal proposal for a standardized, prescribed post-graduate period of medical education was made at the 1912 meeting of the Triological Society and published in the Laryngoscope in 1913. The American Academy of Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology (the two academies formally separated in the late 1977) embraced this initiative by establishing two committees to explore this concept and develop a plan. The otolaryngology committee consisted of representatives from the Academy, the American Laryngological Association, the American Otological Society, the AMA Section on Otolaryngology, and the Triological Society. The committee established, not without controversy, a recommended curriculum of training that should last three years, if possible. The ABOto accredited otolaryngology residencies until 1953 when the Residency Review Committee of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education assumed this responsibility. Under pressure from the Academy, the ABOto was constituted in 1924 to develop a certifying examination, the first of which was administered in 1926. The certifying examination has evolved over the years from its original oral examination and a written histopathology examination. For several years, actual patients with otolaryngological conditions were used in various sites around the country in the \\"practical exam\\". The current format of a multiple choice written and a structured oral examination was established in the 1970s, but has been significantly refined over the past thirty years. Staff The board examinations are currently handled by Executive Director Elect Brian Nussenbaum, MD, FACS.American Board of Otolaryngology Staff Physicians who are not board certified by ABOTO, can misrepresent their board credentials and are not censured or punished by the board.

Early History =1970s= Grand Valley State College, as it was known at the time, launched its football program with a junior varsity schedule in 1970 and became a varsity sport in 1971. Robert \\"Rip\\" Collins, a successful high school coach at Grand Rapids Ottawa Hills High School, became the program's first head coach. In their first two seasons, the Lakers did not even have a home field or stadium to host games. They played the third game of their inaugural season at Soldier Field versus University of Illinois-Chicago Circle. The Lakers lost the game 27‚Äì7. Success didn't come quickly for the Lakers as it took almost three years for them to win their first football game. Coach Collins was unable to get the program off to a successful start after going 0‚Äì13 and being outscored 534‚Äì58 in 1971 and 1972. E. James Harkema took over as head coach in January 1973, coming to GVSU from Northern Illinois where he was an offensive backfield coach. Also awaiting Harkema was a brand new football field constructed in 1972 which featured the first \\"Prescription Athletic Turf\\" (PAT) football playing surface in the country. 1974 marked the first conference play for Grand Valley with the forming of the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. GVSU went 6‚Äì3 and finished third in that inaugural year. Offensive guard Ron Stallard became the second individual Laker honored as he was awarded NAIA AAHM status at the end of the season. 1976 would be the year Grand Valley would receive national attention. The game that put Grand Valley on the map was the season finale against Northern Michigan University. The Wildcats came into Allendale as the defending NCAA Division II National Champions, boasting an 18-game winning streak, ranked No. 1 in Division II and fresh off an 82‚Äì7 win over University of Nebraska-Omaha. And, as they were the team which ended the Lakers chances from going to the NAIA National Playoffs the year prior. GVSU was seeking some payback on their home field. The Lakers, playing 21 seniors built up a 24‚Äì0 lead and went on to shock the Wildcats 31‚Äì14 before a large crowd, which included many top recruits. Winning this game allowed Grand Valley to sign many top All-State players which started the program's push to national attention. Harkema had traditionally built his teams on defense and a solid running game, but in 1977 with the transfer of quarterback Roy Gonzalez from the University of Wyoming, a solid offensive line and using many talented freshmen, Harkema went to the air and won their first ever Great Lakes Conference Championships, ultimately winning three in the next five years. The 1977 team went 7‚Äì3 and had one NAIA All-American, offensive tackle Gary Evans and eight NAIA AAHM athletes: Roy Gonzalez-QB, Daryl Gooden-DT, Mack Lofton-DE, Tim Maki-LB, Roger McCoy-PK, Clint Nash-WR, Joe Pollard-S and Rusty Steffens-OG. Gonzalez was followed by quarterbacks David Quinley, Steve Michuta and Jeff Lynch, who gave GVSU the most feared passing attack in the Grand Lakes Conference. They had been blessed with talented receivers like Clint Nash, Rick Cunningham, Michael Woods, Rob Rubick, Jeff Chadwick and Bill Luckstead as the Lakers averaged seven wins a year from 1977 to 1982. In 1978, with Quinley at the controls, the Lakers suffered early losses to Northern Michigan and Bowling Green State, but bounced back to win eight straight games including a repeat of the GLIAC title and an NAIA Playoff victory over University of Wisconsin‚ÄìLa Crosse. The team ultimately lost to Elon College in the NAIA Semi-Finals on a wet, muddy field in North Carolina. The team finished 9‚Äì3 and secured the winningest season in school history at the time. The team celebrated two NAIA All-Americans in Bob Beaudrie-C and Joe Pollard-DB and four AAHM, Wade Bent-LB, Ron Essink-OT, Roger McCoy-PK and Rick VanEss-FB. This was the highlight of the first decade of football for Grand Valley State. Two players that stood out and won individual national honors: All-American Ron Essink-OT (NCAA DII/NAIA/Kodak) who went on to have an outstanding career in the NFL as a starting tackle with the Seattle Seahawks, and NAIA AAHM Mark Szczytko-DT. 1979 also saw the completion and dedication of the new stadium and track complex named after its president, Arend D. Lubbers, on September 15. The stadium was built around the existing PAT field and had permanent seating for 4,146 fans. The team had one of its few losing seasons, finishing with a 4‚Äì5 record. =1980s= Coach Harkema quickly got the Lakers back to their winning ways finishing the 1980‚Äì82 seasons with records of 7‚Äì2, 7‚Äì3, & 7‚Äì2 respectively. Harkema resigned in November 1982 to accept the head coaching job at Eastern Michigan. He was replaced by Ball State assistant Bob Giesey. Under Giesey in 1983, the Lakers were 4‚Äì4 entering their last two games of the season. The team lost its final two games by two points, 31‚Äì30 to Northwood and 15‚Äì14 to Saginaw Valley to finish 4‚Äì6. The roof caved in the following year and GV went 0‚Äì10 and managed only 99 points for the season. Giesey resigned. Athletic Director Dr. George MacDonald hired Tom Beck away from his assistant coaching job with Chicago Blitz of the United States Football League. Beck had previously turned losing programs at Illinois Benedictine and Elmhurst College, into winners. It took Beck three games to get the Lakers back on track in 1985. Faced with a 14-game losing streak, Beck made some key personnel changes. Beck installed Guy Schuler at quarterback and moved wide receiver Ray Buckner to tailback, linebacker Sylvester Johnson to fullback, and defensive tackle Brian Mulcahy to middle linebacker. The Lakers went out and defeated Evansville 28‚Äì14 and finished the year 6‚Äì5. The next five years would see explosive offenses, outstanding players and solid coaching which would result in trips to the NCAA Division II playoffs, as well as the Lakers becoming a fixture in preseason and postseason rankings. Beck's 1986 team posted a 9‚Äì2 record, In 1987, Beck hired a 25-year-old by the name of Brian Kelly as a graduate assistant and defensive backs coach, a move that would positively impact Lakers football for the next 17 seasons. After a pair of 7‚Äì4 seasons in 1987 and 1988, Beck coached the Lakers to their first undefeated regular season with an 11‚Äì0 record and the final Great Lakes Conference Championship in 1989. Four players obtained national honors: Mark Prins, OT was both AP and Football News AAHM in \\"87\\" and Football News AA in \\"88\\"; while Guy Schuler again was named AP AAHM and Frank Miotke was a Football News AAHM for his first time. GV led Division II in total offense, averaging 480.9 yards per game and also in points with 44.5. One of the highlights of the 1989 season was GVSU's record breaking 91‚Äì0 victory over Valparaiso. The Lakers jumped out to a 56‚Äì0 halftime lead as they rolled up 731 yards in total offense. Freshman kicker Miguel Sagaro from Spain set a Division II record when he connected on 65 of 66 extra points for the season and sophomore fullback Eric Lynch scored 21 touchdowns. Lynch went on to begin an outstanding career with the Detroit Lions. Grand Valley finished third in the final 1989 Division II poll and earned the first of three consecutive playoff berths, losing to Indiana, PA, 34‚Äì24 on a frigid November afternoon highlighted by 11 inches of snow on the ground. 1990s In 1990, Grand Valley, along with GLIAC members Ferris State, Hillsdale, Northern Michigan, Saginaw Valley and Wayne State, joined forces with the schools from the Heartland Conference which included Ashland University, Butler, University of Indianapolis, St Joseph's College and Valparaiso to form the Midwest Intercollegiate Football Conference (MIFC). The Lakers continued their winning ways, posting a 22-game regular season winning streak before falling at Hillsdale, 38‚Äì34. GV won the inaugural MIFC crown, finished with a 10‚Äì2 record and lost to East Texas State, 20‚Äì14 in the playoffs. That 1990 season saw five Lakers win national recognition: Chris Tiede, OC ‚Äì AA Football Gazette; Jim Cramer, DT ‚Äì AA Football Gazette; Eric Lynch, FB ‚Äì AA Football Gazette; Mike Flannery, CB ‚Äì AA Football Gazette and Charles Sippial, LB ‚Äì AA Football Gazette. The 1991 team had eight players earn national awards at the conclusion of the season with five AA and three AAHM. Chris Tiede and Eric Lynch earned AA honors for the second year ‚Äì Tiede from the AP, Football Gazette & Kodak ‚Äì Lynch from the Football Gazette; Todd Wood, DB ‚Äì AA (GTE/COSIDA); Mark Smith, OT ‚Äì AA (GTE/COSIDA); Jim Cramer, DT ‚Äì AA Football Gazette; Jack Hull, QB ‚Äì AAHM Football Gazette; Bill McGory, OG ‚Äì AAHM Football Gazette and Bob Michell, TE ‚Äì AAHM Football Gazette. Grand Valley shared its second MIFC crown with Butler, Ferris and Hillsdale in 1992 with an 8‚Äì3 record. The 1993 season saw the Lakers slide a bit posting a 6‚Äì3‚Äì2 record with key losses to Indiana (PA), Ashland and Hillsdale. Kelly and the Lakers bounced back in 1994 with a return trip to the playoffs and finished with an 8‚Äì4 record and a first round playoff loss. They started and ended that 1994 season with losses to Indiana(PA), regular season opener and first round of playoffs. The Lakers then posted back-to-back 8‚Äì3 seasons in \\"95\\" and \\"96\\", finishing second in the MIFC both years, but no playoff games either season. They again started each season with games against non-conference national competition but both ended in losses ‚Äì \\"95\\"-Indiana(PA) and \\"96\\"-SW Texas State.

Quarterback Jeff Fox led the Lakers to their second straight MIFC title and back into the playoffs in 1998 with a 9‚Äì1 conference mark. They again lost to UC Davis (38‚Äì40) finishing the regular season 9‚Äì2 overall. Fox became Grand Valley State's first-ever Harlon Hill Trophy Finalist (Division II Heisman) as he rewrote the GVSU single-season and career offensive record books. The Laker season was ended by Slippery Rock, again in the first round of the playoffs, 37‚Äì14. Jeff Fox was awarded AA status from CoSIDA/Daktronics/Football Gazette as did Billy Cook, Spcl Teams ‚Äì AA Football Gazette. 2000s Grand Valley Football entered its most successful period during the 2000s (decade). = 2000 = The year 2000 saw the Lakers start their season slowly losing their first three games to South Dakota State, Saginaw Valley State and Northwood. But this sophomore-dominated team regrouped and finished by winning 7 of 8 remaining games, posting a 7‚Äì4 record. = 2001 = In 2001, the dividends of valuable experience in the young players showed as the Lakers not only won their first ever Division II playoff game, but advanced to the 2001 National Championship. Behind a potent offensive attack, Grand Valley State posted a perfect 10‚Äì0 regular season (September 11, 2001 game was canceled) with an average of 58.4 points per game and 48.0 points average margin of victory. GVSU's march to the championship game was not easy, however, as GLIAC Player of the Year quarterback and Harlon Hill Runner-Up Curt Anes, was injured in the Lakers' first playoff game.http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/grva/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/08fbhistory.pdf Grand Valley responded with a first round 42‚Äì14 victory over Bloomsburg, a 33‚Äì30 second round win over Saginaw Valley State, and a semi-final win over Catawba College, 34‚Äì16. One of the backup quarterbacks used during this run was actually a wide receiver brought in to run an option style offense when the other young backup ran into difficulty. In the championship game against North Dakota, the Lakers took a 14‚Äì10 lead with 2:46 left in the game, but the Fighting Sioux responded with a last minute drive of their own to take the title, 17‚Äì14.Bob Johnson, USA Today, \\"North Dakota tops Grand Valley State for D-II title,\\" December 8, 2001. QB Curt Anes set the Division II record for passing efficiency in 2002 (min. 15 attempts per game) with a 221.6 rating (271 attempts, 189 completions, 3 interceptions, 3,086 yards, 48 touchdown passes). = 2002 = A football signed by the 2002 NCAA Division II Champion Grand Valley State Lakers football team The Lakers opened at home against a tough non-conference opponent, California-Davis (which was in its last year of Division II competition) and won 24‚Äì14. The Lakers went on to defeat three ranked teams en route to the undefeated season. The playoffs began with a convincing 62‚Äì13 win over Long Island University-C.W. Post. Then came a matchup against longtime nemesis Indiana University of Pennsylvania. GVSU entered the game 0‚Äì6 against the Indians all-time, however, the Lakers scored on their first eight possessions in the first half and built a 50‚Äì7 halftime lead. The Lakers cruised to a 62‚Äì21 win and advanced to the NCAA DII Semifinals. Grand Valley State again jumped out to an early lead and never looked back with an impressive 44‚Äì7 victory over Northern Colorado (also in its last year of Division II competition). The win advanced GVSU to the NCAA DII National Championship game for the second straight year. The top-ranked Lakers squared off against second-ranked Valdosta State. GVSU led 17‚Äì6 at the half and 24‚Äì6 midway through the fourth quarter. However, VSU scored 18 unanswered points to tie the game with just over three minutes remaining. Curt Anes, who won the Harlon Hill Trophy as the D-II Player of the Year less than 24 hours earlier, utilized his All-American receiver David Kircus to drive the Lakers 68 yards in 2:05 for a touchdown to give GVSU the 2002 NCAA DII National Championship. Anes hit Kircus on a 10-yard pass for the winning score, finishing the season with a perfect 14‚Äì0 record, and was also ranked No. 1 in the AFCA poll each week of the 2002 season. The 2002 team had twelve players earn post season national honors, four of which were repeat winners ‚Äì Curt Anes ‚Äì Harlon Hill Award, All-American (AFCA/D2Football/Daktronics/Football Gazette), GLIAC Player of the Year; David Kircus ‚Äì All-American (AFCA/AP/D2Football/Football Gazette/Daktronics); Dale Westrick ‚Äì All-American (D2Football/Football Gazette/Daktronics) and Dan Vaughn ‚Äì All-American (Football Gazette/AP/D2Football) others include; Keyonta Marshall, DT ‚Äì All-American (Football Gazette/D2Football/Daktronics); Scott Mackey, DB ‚Äì All-American (Football Gazette/AP/D2Football/Daktronics); Reggie Spearman, RB ‚Äì All-American (Football Gazette/D2Football/Daktronics); Anthony Burlison, LB ‚Äì All-American (Football Gazette/Daktronics); Phil Condon, TE ‚Äì All-American (D2Football); Terrance Banks, WR ‚Äì All-American (Football Gazette) and Tom Hosford, OC ‚Äì All-American Honorable Mention (Football Gazette).

The 2003 campaign started with a road win over perennial power and now Division I-AA, UC-Davis. GVSU limited the high-powered offense of the Aggies to just two field goals, while GVSU's All-American kicker David Hendrix, booted three field goals, the final one coming in overtime. The defense did the job the following week as well as they scored two touchdowns en route to a 40‚Äì10 victory over rival Ferris State. Additional wins built GVSU's winning streak to 20 games and their conference streak to 29 games. A date with fourth-ranked Saginaw Valley State was next on the ledger. A GVSU and GLIAC record crowd of 12,832 attended the anticipated contest at Lubbers Stadium in Allendale. After suffering a concussion (which was not discovered until later), GVSU starting quarterback Freshman Cullen Finnerty had several turnovers and miscues in the second half. The Cardinals capitalized to claim a 34‚Äì20 victory. GVSU regrouped and notched a 33‚Äì14 victory at Northwood to build momentum toward another playoff run. However this playoff run had to be done on the road as GV entered the playoffs seeded third in the Northeast Region. The Lakers opened with a 65‚Äì36 win at Bentley College that set up a rematch with SVSU in the Regional Final. The game was a defensive struggle as neither offense could find scoring opportunities. Scott Mackey, GV's All-American DB picked off a pass late in the second quarter to score the game's only touchdown and give GVSU a 10‚Äì3 win. The National Semi-Finals saw another new foe for GVSU: Texas A&M-Kingsville.; GVSU's offense and defense dominated the game and GV won 31‚Äì3 and was off to their third straight NCAA D-II National Championship. A familiar foe was to meet Grand Valley: North Dakota. The game was sure to be a defensive battle as both teams rode their defenses to the title game. GVSU was leading 3‚Äì0 in the third quarter, but UND was driving into Laker territory looking for the lead when Lucius Hawkins made the play of the game. Hawkins forced the Sioux QB to fumble, and Lucius returned the ball 59 yards to the North Dakota 20-yard line. All-American Running Back Michael Tennessee scored three plays later and gave GVSU a 10‚Äì0 lead. GVSU led 10‚Äì3 in the closing minutes as North Dakota was driving. Senior linebacker Mike Hoad picked off a pass on the Laker 10-yard line to preserve the win and give GVSU back-to-back NCAA DII National Championships. The 2003 GVSU senior class etched their names in the record books by becoming just the second team (the other being the University of North Alabama) in NCAA Division II history to make three consecutive trips to title game. GVSU's defense held North Dakota to just 22 yards rushing in the title game, and held three straight playoff opponents without a touchdown. Saginaw Valley State, Texas A&M-Kingsville; and North Dakota. The Lakers were the first NCAA DII football playoff team to win four straight road games en route to a championship. The Laker seniors were 47‚Äì2 in their final 49 games and tallied a four-year GLIAC record of 34‚Äì4. = 2004 = The 2004 season opened the era of a new mentor as Brian Kelly left following the 2003 season to take the head coaching job at Central Michigan University. Chuck Martin became the fifth head coach in the history of the Laker football program. Martin won more games (10) than any of the four previous head coaches in their first year at the helm. GVSU went 8‚Äì2 in the regular season finishing 2nd in the GLIAC (Michigan Technological University won its first GLIAC title that year). They also played in front of the largest crowd (50,123) in their history when they played against Michigan Tech in Michigan Stadium at the University of Michigan in the \\"Bash at the Big House\\".http://archive.wzzm13.com/news/article/33049/0/Grand-Valley-is-best-at- Big-House However, since they were the lowest-seed (6th) in the Northwest region (the GLIAC had been moved out of the NE after DII playoffs were expanded from 16 teams to 24 teams, GV had to go on the road in the playoffs, again. They played the NSIC champion Winona State University at their field and won a hard fought game 16‚Äì13. In the second round, Grand Valley was able to beat Northwood, avenging a regular season loss, winning 10‚Äì7. Grand Valley appeared in their fourth straight Regional Final against a new, growing rival: North Dakota. In a hard fought game that the Lakers let slip away late in the fourth quarter (15‚Äì19), GV ended Coach Martin's first season at 10‚Äì3. The 2004 Laker senior class concluded their careers with a 51‚Äì5 record, including two National Championships and three title game appearances. The 51 wins by the Lakers senior class tied the D-II record for wins in a career. DT Keyonta Marshall became GVSU's first-ever three time All-American and played for the Philadelphia Eagles after being drafted in the 7th round of the 2005 NFL Draft. Grand Valley State continued to set single-season attendance records with a single-game average of 10,799 in 2004. Several players earned honors after the season: Keyonta Marshall, DT ‚Äì AA (AFCA/AP/Football Gazette/Daktronics/D2Football/College Sports Report); Scott Greene, PK ‚Äì AA (AP/D2Football/College Sports Report); DeJuane Boone, DB ‚Äì AA (Football Gazette/Daktronics); Lucius hawkins, DB ‚Äì AA (Football Gazette/Daktronics/D2Football/College Sports Report); Demonte Collins, WR ‚Äì AAHM D2Football. = 2005 = Because GV did not advance to the national title game in 2004, the 2005 season came with much anticipation and concern. Coach Chuck Martin proceeded to lead the Lakers to their second undefeated season in history, going 13‚Äì0 and defeating Northwest Missouri State University in the NCAA Division II Football Championship title game. The Bearcats were ranked 21st in the nation coming into the tournament, the lowest ever for a Division II football playoff team. Chuck Martin's 23‚Äì3 record over his first two years as a head coach sets the records for Grand Valley Head Coaches in most wins in their first two seasons (23), and best winning percentage (0.885). Lubbers Stadium also saw numerous improvements, including a new football complex with home and visiting locker rooms, and expanded seating, bringing the official capacity of Lubbers Stadium to nearly 9,000. However, crowds of over 10,000 have frequently packed Lubbers Stadium to watch important games and the attendance record was broken twice during this season. The current record of 14,557 people was set when No. 1 Grand Valley State defeated rival Ferris State in the first game of the season. 2005 also saw the first year of the much-needed new scoreboard. Daktronics Inc. installed a new scoreboard, complete with digital video display at the North end of Lubbers Stadium. Several players from the 2005 squad won national awards. Leading the way was junior defensive end Michael McFadden who was a consensus All-American and received the Gene Upshaw award for best defensive lineman in DII. Coach Martin was voted by the American Football Coaches Association as the National Coach of the Year for Division II. = 2006 = The Lakers had an undefeated 2006 season, winning the GLIAC title, and the NCAA Division II National Championship, ranked No. 1 throughout the season and finishing with a (15‚Äì0) record. In the national title match, the Lakers again faced undefeated and second-ranked Division II rivals Northwest Missouri State, which finished the season with a (14‚Äì1) record. Senior quarterback Cullen Finnerty became the winningest quarterback in NCAA All-Division history, with a career record of 51‚Äì4, and was named to the 2006 American Football Coaches Association All America Team. He finished the 2006 season with a 15‚Äì0 record, completing 195 of 343 passes for 3,220 yards and 41 touchdowns, and leading the nation in quarterback efficiency with 169.32. He also rushed for 580 yards and 8 touchdowns himself, for a total offense of 3,800 yards and 49 touchdowns on the season. Finnerty was awarded second place for the Harlon Hill Trophy, just prior to the national championship match in Florence, Alabama.http://www.harlonhill.com/Current_News/Hill%20History%2086-13.pdf During the Championship game, held on Saturday, December 16, Finnerty ran the ball for 115 yards, leading the Lakers through an exciting game to a 17‚Äì14 victory. Finnerty, WR Eric Fowler, OL Brandon Barnes, DL Mike McFadden, LB Anthony Adams, and CB Brandon Carr each earned Daktronics First Team All American honors. Additionally, senior defensive end Michael McFadden tied the NCAA All-Division record for consecutive games with a quarterback sack (17), and broke the Division II quarterback sack record (34.5) for a career. McFadden also won the Gene Upshaw award that is given to the best defensive lineman in DII for the second year in a row. The 2006 senior class produced a career record of 52‚Äì4 over 4 seasons. Coach Chuck Martin improved his 3-season record as the head coach to 38‚Äì3 (0.927 winning percentage), and to 86‚Äì9 overall (.905) since joining the GVSU coaching staff as an assistant in 2000. Steve Brockelbank was the offensive coordinator for the second year as well as the assistant head coach. Coach Martin was voted by the American Football Coaches Association as the National Coach of the Year for Division II for the 2nd consecutive year, repeating Brian Kelly's back-to-back honors for the same award in 2002 & 2003. Cullen Finnerty finished his Laker career with a record of 51‚Äì4 as the team's starting QB, making him the winningest quarterback in college football history, regardless of NCAA Division. = 2007 = December 8: GVSU's 40 game win streak ‚Äì an all-time Division II record ‚Äì was snapped when they lost at Northwest Missouri State in the Division II National Semifinal game at Bearcat Stadium that was known as the \\"Ice Bowl\\" because it was played during the Mid-December 2007 North American Winter storms that would destroy more than 100 trees at Northwest's Missouri Arboretum campus. Grand Valley was ranked #1 and was undefeated and Northwest was ranked #5 and had lost one game but hosted the game because of strength of schedule. It began as a close game with Grand Valley leading 13‚Äì10 at halftime. The Lakers were able to pull within one, 17‚Äì16, late in the third quarter on Justin Trumble's third field goal. After NWMSU kicker Tommy Frevert made one from 22 yards early in the fourth quarter and Xavier Omon scored on an 11-yard pass 2¬Ω minutes later, the Bearcats were up 27‚Äì16. Five plays later, Omon broke loose for a 98-yard touchdown run with just over 9 minutes remaining. Final score: GVSU 16, NWMSU 34.

Minnesota-Duluth had a record of 12‚Äì0 entering the game. GVSU claimed their fourth consecutive GLIAC championship. = 2009 = In their week 3 matchup against Saginaw Valley, Lakers fans set an all-time GLIAC and Lubbers Stadium attendance record, with a crowd of 16,467. The Lakers would go 6‚Äì0 before losing their first GLIAC game in nearly five years, falling to the Hillsdale Chargers 27‚Äì24 in the Chargers' homecoming game, yet still won the GLIAC outright for a fifth straight year. Grand Valley then received a first round bye in the playoffs only to face Hillsdale once again. After defeating Hillsdale, University of Minnesota Duluth, and Carson-Newman, the Lakers eventually fell to Northwest Missouri State University in the DII National Championship game 30‚Äì23. Danny Richard, Nick McDonald and Jacob McGuckin were named first team All-American while Cameron Bradfield and Justin Victor took home second team honors and Quarterback Brad Iciek was a Harlon Hill Trophy finalist. 2010s = 2010 = GVSU vs. West Texas A&M; Matt Mitchell took over as head coach with Chuck Martin leaving to join Brian Kelly's staff at Notre Dame. Mitchell had previously served as defensive coordinator under Martin. GVSU won their 6th GLIAC championship in a row and advanced to the second round of the playoffs to finish with an 11‚Äì2 overall record.

Luther Ware led in sacks and Rob Carlisle and Matt Baker were tops with four interceptions apiece. = 2011 = Despite a slow start, which included losing their first three conference games, the Lakers still managed an 8‚Äì3 overall record, winning their last seven games. That streak qualified Grand Valley State as having the longest winning streak in Division II football at the end the season. GVSU led the GLIAC in many categories, including scoring offense, total and rushing offense.

Early life  Cloete was born in Paris to Margaret Edit Park, granddaughter of Glasgow banker Edward Fairley, and Lawrence Woodbine Cloete from South Africa, whose grandfather Henry Cloete had been Special Commissioner in Natal. He was educated in England at Lancing College, a school which at present gives out a yearly prize in his honour to a student who excels in literature and creative writing. At Lancing he joined the Officers Training Corps and at the age of seventeen took the Sandhurst entrance exam. From there he was commissioned as a Second-Lieutenant (at the beginning of the First World War in 1914) into the Ninth King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, before later transferring to the Coldstream Guards. He was wounded in August 1916 and three days later arrived in London to be nursed at King Edward VII's Hospital Sister Agnes, at 9 Grosvenor Gardens, before convalescing in Hove, Sussex.A Victorian Son, autobiography, 1897‚Äì1922 published 1972 Collins, London Writing career He published his first novel, Turning Wheels, in 1937: it became a best-seller, selling more than two million copies. Importation of the book was subsequently banned in South Africa, owing to its commentary on the Great Trek, the event in which the book is set. Many of his 14 novels and most of his short stories are historically based fictional adventures, set against the backdrop of major African, and, in particular, South African historical events. Apart from Turning Wheels, another prominent novel, 1963's Rags of Glory, is set during the Boer war (with, according to its foreword, much of the historical information based on Rayne Kruger's Goodbye Dolly Gray.) Two of his novels were turned into movies: The Fiercest Heart (1961) is based on his 1955 novel of the same name, and Majuba, released in 1968, is based on his 1941 novel The Hill of the Doves. Film producer Albert R. Broccoli attempted to film Rags of Glory in the mid-1960s with David Lean directing, but Lean subsequently ‚Äì despite his initial interest in the book which he called \\"very good in an awful sort of way\\" and its subject matter ‚Äì rebuffed the offer. By 1974 Broccoli still intended to film the book. He wrote short stories. He published at least eight volumes in his lifetime. In addition to producing South-African related works, Cloete was among the pioneers of the by-now voluminous literary subgenre depicting the aftermath of nuclear war. His 1947 novelette The Blast is written as the diary of a survivor living in the ruins of New York (published in 6 Great Short Novels of Science Fiction, ed. Groff Conklin, 1954). Other written genres to which he contributed included poetry (collected in a volume published in 1941, The Young Men and the Old) and biography (African Portraits, 1946). He published the first part of his autobiography, A Victorian Son, in 1972 and the second, The Gambler, in 1973. Stuart Cloete died on 19 March 1976, in Cape Town, South Africa. Following Cloete's death, the copyright to his works passed to his widow. After her death in August 1993, the copyright passed to Cloete's American-South African friend Warren Wilmot Williams. Although Cloete never wished to have any children of his own, he regarded Williams as an \\"adopted\\" son. In the late 1960s Cloete was instrumental in launching the young Williams' career as a documentary film producer and media executive. After inheriting the Stuart Cloete literary estate, Warren Williams established a trust to hold the copyright to Cloete's works. The copyright is managed by the British-based company Stuart Cloete Print Holdings Ltd. Personal life He lived most of his adult life in the town of Hermanus, in the Western Cape. Cloete was married to Tiny Cloete. She outlived him and died in August 1993. They did not have any children.

According to Milton Diamond, it is the world's largest organization of intersex persons. A decentralised network, OII was founded in 2003 by Curtis Hinkle. Upon Hinkle's retirement, American intersex activist Hida Viloria served as Chairperson/President elect from April 2011 through November 2017, when s/he resigned in order to focus on OII's American affiliate, OII-USA's transition into the independent American non-profit, the Intersex Campaign for Equality. Mission OII was established to give voice to intersex people, including those speaking languages other than just English, for people born with bodies which have atypical sexual characteristics such as gonads, chromosomes, and/or genitals. OII acknowledges intersex as a normal human biological variation, and rejects the terminology of disorder, as in DSD/Disorders of Sex Development, utilized by some other intersex groups, as well as the sexualization of intersex (as in Intersexuality). They acknowledge intersex people's own distinct sexuality, as people who may identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, queer, trans, straight, or other, in alliance with other members of the LGBTI population.. Sociologist Georgiann Davis describes OII and (the now defunct) Intersex Society of North America as \\"activist organisations\\". The objective of OII is to achieve equality and human rights for intersex people, and end human rights violations against them, particularly the practice of non-consensual genital surgeries on infants and minors. The ethos of the group is that people will hold different views as appropriate to the individual; this often entails treating as optional socially and medically constructed categories such as binary genders and sexual identifications; the identity human being being seen as the fundamental identity.

It was built in 1913 at a cost of ¬£20,000 for theatre impresario Francis Laidler, and opened on Wednesday 18 March 1914. In 1964, Bradford City Council bought the Alhambra for ¬£78,900 and in 1974, it was designated a Grade II listed building. It underwent extensive refurbishment in 1986. Today it is a receiving house for large-scale touring theatre of all types and the main house seats 1,456. History Francis Laidler, who already owned two music halls in Bradford, opened the new Alhambra Theatre in 1914. The architects were Chadwick and Watson, who described it as \\"English renaissance of the Georgian period\\". Building The building is recognisable for its large domed turret with giant-paired Corinthian columns, an iconic landmark on the Bradford skyline together with the complementary domes on the adjacent, disused Bradford Odeon. Behind this, the building is stepped up, culminating in tall square towers with smaller domes. It is situated on a sloping site amongst other Bradford landmarks ‚Äì the National Media Museum, aforementioned Bradford Odeon, the former Windsor Baths building and Bradford City Park. The entrance to the building is on the corner on the other side of the building to the dome and has a distinctive iron and glass canopy. Elsewhere, the exterior is faced in white faience, which has now been painted white and grey. The faience was produced by Gibbs and Canning of Tamworth. Inside, the auditorium consists of two tiers, a balcony and an aisle. It is highly decorated with plasterwork. There is moulded plasterwork to the curved balcony fronts and elliptically bowed balconies to the boxes, which are situated in round arched openings with giant fluted Corinthian columns. The circular auditorium ceiling is decorated and has a small rectangular dome to centre. There is a rectangular proscenium arch. Organisation The Alhambra is part of the Bradford Theatres group, which also includes St. George's Hall and King's Hall, Ilkley. The theatre is also a member of the Dance Consortium, a group of theatres who collaborate to bring international dance theatre to the UK. Facilities =Main house= The 1,400 capacity main house is a major touring venue and hosts a wide range of stage shows from ballet and opera to variety and comedy, musicals, drama and, of course, the annual pantomime. Regular visits are made from prestigious companies such as Opera North, the Royal Shakespeare Company, Birmingham Royal Ballet, Northern Ballet Theatre, Matthew Bourne's New Adventures and the Royal National Theatre to complement spectacular West End musicals such as Grease, Miss Saigon, Whistle Down the Wind and The Phantom of the Opera. Wicked started its world tour at the Alhambra Theatre in 2016 =Studio Theatre= The complex also houses a smaller studio theatre, with seating for 200, or standing room for 300. This is mainly used for new comedy, including tours by Alun Cochrane, Tom Stade & Patrick Monahan. =Catering= In 2012 a brand new restaurant, called \\"Restaurant 1914\\" was opened at the top of the Alhambra theatre, with views overlooking Bradford City Park. This new restaurant, headed by head chef John Monkhouse and senior bars and catering manager Marc Johannson, was constructed at a cost of ¬£250,000 and has more than doubled the dining capacity of the theatre.

The video garnered popularity on the video sharing site YouTube. There are now five major videos plus two outtakes and several background videos on YouTube. Matt dances alone in the first videos. In 2008 others join with him doing the dance \\"jig\\"; in 2010 he does the Diski Dance in South Africa. In 2012 he works with other dancers, sometimes using a local dance or another dance step.Behind the Dancing Matt Videos. David Pogue. The New York Times, July 12, 2012. accessed 2013-02-24. While working in Australia for Activision on the project All Humans Must Die, Harding claimed that: \\"My life had become this rhythmic migration from bubble to bubble. You wake up in your apartment bubble, you get in your car bubble, you go to your work bubble, you get in your car, and then you go to you know, whatever, the outdoor shopping plaza bubble, back in your car bubble, back in your apartment bubble. There wasn‚Äôt a lot of exposure to the outside world ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs really insulating.\\" Quitting his job he traveled the world from 2003 to 2004, known by his friends for a particular dance, and while video recording each other in Vietnam in May 2003,‚ÄúFAQ‚Äù page on the ‚ÄúWhere The Hell Is Matt?‚Äù website, answer to ‚ÄúHow long did it take you to make the first video?‚Äù, retrieved 2012-06-21 his travel companions suggested he add the dance. The videos were uploaded to his website for friends and family to enjoy. After completing a second journey to Africa in 2004, Harding edited together 15 dance scenes, all with him center frame, with the background music \\"Sweet Lullaby\\" by Deep Forest. The original song uses samples from a dying Solomon Islands language which was recorded in 1971 by a French ethnomusicologist at the Solomon Islands near Papua New Guinea. The song, \\"Rorogwela\\" was sung by a young woman named Afunakwa. According to the video \\"Where the Hell is Afunakwa\\" by Matt Harding, Afunakwa died in 1998. The video was passed around by e-mail and eventually became popular, with his server getting 20,000 or more hits a day as it was discovered, generally country by country due to language barriers, before the launch of major video upload sites. Harding created a second version of the video in 2006, with additional dancing scenes from subsequent travels, called \\"Dancing 2006\\". At the request of Stride, a gum brand, he accepted sponsorship of this video, since he usually travels on a limited budget. Harding states: \\"I went in very wary about working with a corporate sponsor but ... they didn‚Äôt want to make a commercial for their gum out of it. They‚Äôve got commercials; you can see them on TV all the time. But they‚Äôd seen what was going on on the internet ‚Äì and by that time YouTube had taken off and it was becoming a big deal ‚Ä¶ and a lot of companies they want to be a part of that. But it‚Äôs very very difficult, too, because as soon as a company gets in there and starts making things, we as viewers, a switch flicks in your head and you know you are watching an ad and you interpret it differently. So they said, ‚ÄòWe want to help you make it, but we‚Äôre not making it.‚Äô\\" The video, with more than 18 million views, shows Harding dancing for 3 to 7 seconds apiece in 36 locations mostly in front of distinct landmarks. The evident advertising only comes with two Stride logo watermarked scenes halfway into the video and a final credit. In August of 2008, Harding gave a talk at the Ignite conference in Seattle where he described how dancing by himself had become ‚Äúboring‚Äù whereas dancing with others was far more interesting. For his newest video Harding had developed a listserv for every country from which he received an email, created a digital sign-up sheet for visit requests, and notified people when he would come to their country. Released on June 20, 2008, the third video is the product of 14 months of traveling in 42 countries. The background music/song of this video is known as \\"Praan\\" composed by Garry Schyman and sung by Palbasha Siddique, with lyrics adapted from the poem \\"Stream of Life,\\" a part of the Gitanjali by Rabindranath Tagore. Music source at the end of video. As of August 2008, Harding is represented by Creative Artists Agency. His videos are viewable on YouTube, Google Video, Vimeo and his own site wherethehellismatt.com. His \\"Where the Hell is Matt? (2008)\\" video has been watched over 43,700,000 times on YouTube since 2011 and Harding's YouTube channel is ranked \\"#83 - Most Subscribed (All Time) - Directors\\" as of December 22, 2010. On June 20, 2012, 4 years after his third video, Harding released \\"Where the Hell is Matt? 2012\\". The video features Matt and many others dancing in 71 locations, comprising 55 countries and 11 US states. The video uses the song \\"Trip the Light\\", composed by Garry Schyman and sung by Alicia Lemke. Where the Hell is Matt? 2012 ‚Äì YouTube The song was made available on iTunes, along with \\"Praan\\" and the song titled \\"Dance Outtakes Song\\" used in a video released on July 11, 2012, that features outtakes as well as locations which did not make the final video. Drawing on the practice of Culture Jams, the Situationist International movement and the practices of incorporation and excorporation, Milstein and Pulos conclude that \\"while some of Harding‚Äôs videos are tied to corporate sponsorship, the arc of his projects also argues for the possibility of reorienting oneself with others to keep one step ahead of incorporation ‚Äì even, ironically, while actively sponsored. This sense of possibility is essential in contemporary society as even not-for-profit public institutions ‚Äì including universities and philanthropic organizations ‚Äì seek out sponsorship from multinational corporations.\\" On November 2015, Harding launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the making of a new video. Backers were allowed to vote on places where they would like him to go to for his new videos and he raised $146,075 out of a $125,000 goal. Via social media, he also broadcast the places where he would be dancing and invited netizens to participate in the making of his new video. By October 2016, he has finished his global dancing tour and is finalizing the edit of the video. Major media coverage Harding's video clips have appeared on television shows including: * The Screen Savers (March 17, 2005) * MSNBC's Countdown with Keith Olbermann (August 18, 2005) * Inside Edition (August 19, 2005) * The Ellen DeGeneres Show (October 10, 2005) * Rude Tube (February 15, 2008) * 40 Greatest Internet Celebrities on VH1 * Jimmy Kimmel Live! (August 6, 2008) * Enough Rope (August 18, 2008) * The Daily Show (November 6, 2008) * Good Morning America (May 31, 2006) In 2007, Jawed Karim, one of the founders of YouTube, stated that Harding's video was his favorite on YouTube at that time. On July 22, 2008, and again on July 25, 2010, and July 10, 2012, and June 14, 2020, NASA featured Harding's videos on the APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) Web site. Text accompanying these videos, under the heading \\"Happy People Dancing on Planet Earth,\\" claims that humans worldwide share a common love of dance, stating that \\"few people are able to watch the above video without smiling.\\" Harding himself has joked that he is impressed by his appearances on APOD, especially since his videos have nothing to do with astronomy, nor are they pictures. Hoax On 11 December 2008, Matt Harding sarcastically 'revealed' at the Entertainment Gathering that \\"everyone knows how easy it is to ‚Äúfake things‚Äù on the internet\\" the videos were an elaborate hoax and that he is an actor hired by a viral marketing New York ad agency, not a game designer, and the videos were made using animatronic puppets and extensive video editing. His presentation‚Äôs pie chart of expenses included one million dollars for ‚Äúrobot uprising insurance.‚Äù Harding‚Äôs prankster hoax was lost on many when his talk was posted online, with a larger public perceiving the prank as a confession. A month after his presentation, criticism was so widespread that at the Macworld convention Harding revealed the \\"hoax about the hoax\\" and joked about the fact many people took it seriously. He explained he came up with the prankster idea when he himself felt duped by a viral video titled ‚ÄúBike Hero,‚Äù which turned out to be a marketing campaign. He also made it very clear that the videos he made were indeed 100% real. Videos The titles in the five major videos are all titled Dancing without the year in the videos; Harding labels them as Where the Hell is Matt? (year) on YouTube. The 2012 YouTube titles have also been titled Happy People Dancing on Planet Earth as well as Happy New Year! Peace on Earth in 2013. =Dancing [2005]= Duration: 2:45 Dancing [2005] # Beijing, China.

At its height, Fay's Drugs operated its core business, along with Wheels Discount Auto and The Paper Cutter Books and Office and Party Supply. History =Beginning= A Fay's brand matchbook from the 1970s In 1958, the first Fay's Drug Store was opened in Fairmount, New York by Henry A. Panasci, Jr. and his father Henry Panasci Sr. The store was named after Faye Panasci, wife of Henry Panasci, Jr. Fay's steadily grew in Central New York‚Äîthe resulting Fay's Drugs Company, Inc. was incorporated on October 20, 1966 and Fay's Drugs opened its headquarters in Syracuse, New York with the bulk of its operations residing in Liverpool, New York. At its peak there were over 300 stores operating in New York and Northeast Pennsylvania. Fay's enjoyed #1 market share in Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Albany. =Acquisitions= In 1979 Fay's acquired the Key Drug store chain in Rochester, NY and converted them to Fay's; further expanding their Rochester area market. In 1991, Fay's Drugs acquired the 48 drug stores operated by Victory Markets as Carls Drugs. Carls Drugs was founded by Carl Panasci, brother and uncle to the Fay's Drugs founders. =Divestures= In the mid-1990s, Fay's Drugs decide to divest itself of its non-core subsidiaries. The company closed nine under-performing stores in its Paper Cutter subsidiary in April 1993. In 1996, the company sold its remaining 29 Paper Cutter stores to Long Island-based Party Experience Inc., a chain of party- and holiday- oriented supply stores, which converted the Paper Cutter stores to the Party Experience format the following year. In December 1995, the company sold its Wheels Discount Auto Supply subsidiary with its 82 auto parts stores in New York and Pennsylvania to the Sears-owned Western Auto Supply for $37 million. Alternate Link via ProQuest. =JCPenney= In 1996, Fay's Drugs was sold to JCPenney for $285 million in stock. JCPenney merged its drug operations into Eckerd in 1997. Many of the original Fay's Drugs locations that have not been closed in favor of stand-alone Eckerd stores (many now Rite Aid locations) still feature the familiar Fay's aisle and pharmacy formats that served as models for drug chains nationwide.

This was a place for the care of the poor and was one of many workhouses constructed throughout the country following the introduction of the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834.The King‚Äôs Norton Web Site: Timeline - Poor Laws, Workhouses, and Social Support The new workhouse, which was designed by Edward Holmes, was built on the site and opened in 1870. A workhouse infirmary, which was designed by Daniel Arkell to a pavilion plan and entirely lit by electric light, was built by Thomas Rowbotham of Small Heath at a cost of ¬£45,000 and opened in September 1897. It provided accommodation for about 300 patients. =Expansion= A new entrance block was completed in 1902 and a large nurses' home which became known as Woodlands was completed in 1908. The workhouse became a home for the chronically sick known as Selly Oak House and the home and the infirmary combined to join the National Health Service as Selly Oak Hospital in 1948. The Royal Centre for Defence Medicine was formed at the hospital and was officially opened by the Princess Royal in April 2001. In March 2007, the families of certain injured servicemen alleged that the hospital was not treating Iraq War veterans properly. There were also reports of servicemen being verbally abused in the hospital by members of the public opposed to the war. Following a visit to the hospital Jeremy Clarkson added to the criticism by writing to the NHS complaining that injured servicemen had no dedicated ward and that they were treated no differently from \\"a lad who got drunk and smashed his Citro√´n into a tree\\". A report published by the House of Commons Defence Select Committee blamed the allegations against the hospital on a smear campaign and praised the clinical care provided to military patients. =Closure and site redevelopment= On 23 May 2010 a 'Service of Thanks' was held at Selly Oak Hospital to celebrate a century of caring and to share memories of the facility. After services had transferred to the new Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Selly Oak Hospital closed in October 2011. On 24 February 2015 the Trust announced that it had exchanged contracts with Persimmon for the sale of the site with outline planning permission for 650 homes.

Virginia which struck down all anti-miscegenation laws remaining in sixteen U.S. states. In the United States, anti-miscegenation laws were U.S. state laws banning interracial marriage, mainly forbidding marriage between two different races, until the Warren Court ruled unanimously in 1967 that these state laws were unconstitutional. Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote in the court majority opinion that \\"the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual, and cannot be infringed by the State.\\" Loving Day is not an officially recognized holiday by the U.S. government, despite attempts to make it so. Loving Day is the biggest multiracial celebration in the United States. History Loving Day originated with the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case Loving v. Virginia, which invalidated laws prohibiting interracial marriage. The case was brought by Mildred Loving (), a woman classified as \\"colored\\" under Virginia's Racial Integrity Act of 1924, and Richard Loving, a white man, who first met when she was 11 and he was 17. He was a family friend and over the years they courted. After she became pregnant, they married in Washington, D.C., in 1958, when she was 18. Reportedly, Mildred did not realize that interracial marriage was illegal, and they were arrested a few weeks after they returned to their hometown north of Richmond, Virginia. They pleaded guilty to charges of \\"cohabiting as man and wife, against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth\\", and avoided jail time by leaving Virginia and agreeing not to return to the state for 25 years. The Lovings moved to Washington, D.C., and began legal action by writing to U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy.\\"Mildred Loving, Key Figure in Civil Rights Era, Dies\\" , PBS Online News Hour, May 6, 2008 Kennedy referred the case to the American Civil Liberties Union. After the Warren Court unanimously ruled in favor of the young couple, they returned to Virginia, where they lived with their three children. In 1975, Richard Loving died in a car accident. Mildred Loving died May 5, 2008, at the age of 68.Martin, Douglas. \\"Mildred Loving, Who Battled Ban on Mixed-Race Marriage, Dies at 68\\" , New York Times, May 6, 2008. Each June 12, the anniversary of the ruling, Loving Day events around the country mark the advances of mixed-race couples. Legacy Many organizations sponsor annual parties across the country, with Lovingday.org providing an online legal map, courtroom history of anti- miscegenation laws, as well as offering testimonials by and resources for interracial couples. Inspired by Juneteenth (which commemorates the end of slavery in the state of Texas), Loving Day seeks both to commemorate and celebrate the Supreme Court's 1967 ruling, keeping its importance fresh in the minds of a generation which has grown up with interracial relationships being legal, as well as explore issues facing couples currently in interracial relationships. The Loving Day website features information, including court transcripts of the Loving v. Virginia case and of other court cases in which the legality of anti-miscegenation laws was challenged. To celebrate the holiday, people are encouraged to hold parties in which the case and its modern-day legacy are discussed, in smaller settings such as living rooms, backyards, etc., as well as in larger gatherings. Ken Tanabe is credited with forming the idea for Loving Day. He created the idea in 2004 for his senior thesis at Parsons the New School of Design.

The park is managed by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation. History A portion of the land within Moore State Park was once the home of at least five 18th- and 19th- century watermills that were powered by Turkey Hill Brook, which cascades 90 feet over a 400-foot run. The first mills on the site were a gristmill and sawmill built as early as 1747. Visible remnants of the mill village include a triphammer, quarry, schoolhouse, and tavern. In the early 20th century, the property became a private estate, large portions of which were subsequently included in the state park. In 2003, park staff working with the American Chestnut Foundation created a large plantation of experimentally bred chestnut trees as part of efforts to return blight-resistant American chestnut trees to the United States. Activities and amenities Park recreational opportunities include canoeing, fishing, hunting, hiking, cross-country skiing, and picnicking. Interpretive programs and concerts are held in season.

Upon her introduction on 6 July 1987, the character was played by Lisa Armytage. Following Armytage's decision to quit the role in 1988, producers chose to recast the role to Shaunna O'Grady. O'Grady relocated from Sydney to Melbourne for filming and her first scenes as Beverly aired on 16 March 1989. Beverly took on the role of the serial's local GP, and became a love interest for established regular Jim Robinson (Alan Dale). After a bad start, Beverly and Jim realise that they have many shared interests and they eventually marry. However, their marriage falls apart due to Beverly's desire to have a child of her own. Producers decided not to renew O'Grady's contract and Beverly departed on 5 September 1990. O'Grady reprised the role in 2005, along with several former cast members for a cameo appearance in the serial's 20th anniversary episode \\"Friends for Twenty Years\\". She reprised the role again on 19 March 2019, as Beverly is brought back to Erinsborough by her former stepson Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis). The character has since made sporadic appearances to treat patients, and had a brief relationship with fellow doctor Clive Gibbons (Geoff Paine). Casting Beverly Marshall was originally played by Lisa Armytage. Armytage quit the role in 1988, and the script writers decided to send the character off to a conference for a few months. This allowed them time to cast Shaunna O'Grady in the role.Hopwood 1989, p.59. O'Grady took over the role of Beverly in March 1989, after she successfully passed a screen test when she dropped into Grundys while passing through Melbourne. O'Grady relocated to Melbourne from Sydney to be closer to the studios. She described taking over the role from Lisa Armytage as \\"very strange\\". On her experience of joining the cast she said, \\"It really was fun, as I recall. Cast and crew were friendly, and we laughed a LOT\\". However, she found it hard taking on the role as she had not seen the show before, and no one told could tell her about Beverly. There was a notable difference between the two actresses, O'Grady was blonde while Armytage was a brunette. Of this, O'Grady said \\"We don't look at all alike, obviously we aren't the same person and there's been no attempt to make me look like Lisa\\". She also added, \\"I think I will just be recognised as a different actor and go from there\\". Development =Introduction and marriage to Jim Robinson= Beverly as portrayed by Lisa Armytage in 1987 (left) and Shaunna O'Grady in 1990 (right), with noticeably light blonde hair. Beverly was introduced as the show's new GP, following Clive Gibbons' (Geoff Paine) departure,Wallis 1989, p.74. and a love interest for Jim Robinson (Alan Dale).Monroe 1994, p.101. An Inside Soap writer described her as having a \\"prickly persona\\", while O'Grady said she was \\"very buttoned-down\\". Beverly and Jim are brought together by Jim's cousin Hilary Robinson (Anne Scott-Pendlebury), after she learns that Beverly will be in Erinsborough for a conference. Hilary asks Jim to take care of her friend for a few days. Of Beverly and Jim's early relationship, Armytage stated: She's not even interested in him to start off with. Jim thinks he has been set up by his cousin Hilary, which makes him very much on the defensive. He's prepared for us to go out to lunch, but he treats Beverly so abominably, and she is very huffy when she realises what he thinks. So it takes a while before they start to relate to each other properly.\\"Oram 1988, p.111. Jim soon learns that he has many interests in common with Beverly, including golf and fishing, and they start a relationship, which was described as being \\"intense and frequently difficult\\" by Neil Wallis and Dave Hogan of The Neighbours Factfile. When Beverly saves the life of Jim's mother-in-law Helen Daniels (Anne Haddy), she earns Jim's \\"undying gratitude\\". Jim and Beverly marry at Number 26 Ramsay Street in February 1988, and Beverly became the show's first female character to refuse to take her husband's name.Monroe 1996, p.124. The couple's marriage is strained by Beverly's desire to have a child. Josephine Monroe, author of Neighbours: The First 10 Years, wrote that Beverly became a \\"hormonal mess\\" as her desperation for a baby increased. Jim thought caring for her niece and nephew was enough, but he eventually agrees to try for a baby.Monroe 1996, p.40. Beverly falls pregnant, but suffers a miscarriage. She then considers adoption, but Jim is rejected for being too old. Beverly briefly fosters an abandoned child, but when he is taken away, she \\"fell to pieces\\". O'Grady liked this storyline and how Beverly \\"was on the edge\\", but she was disappointed when it \\"petered out\\" and thought it could have been more interesting. =Departure and returns= When O'Grady's contract came up for renewal, producers took the decision not to renew it. O'Grady said that she would have continued with Neighbours if it had been up to her. Beverly's exit storyline began with the introduction of her former boyfriend Ewan O'Brien (Peter Sumner), who works with her on some research, causing further problems in her marriage. Jim and Beverly are driven apart and their marriage soon ends. They divorce and Beverly decides to leave Erinsborough. In July 2005, O'Grady joined several former cast members for a cameo appearance in the serial's 20th anniversary episode \\"Friends for Twenty Years\\". On 22 January 2019, Filiz Mehmedova of Digital Spy confirmed that O'Grady would be reprising her role once again, after fans noticed a name card for Beverly in a photograph of a table read. The character returned on 19 March 2019. Beverly is contacted by her former stepson Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis), who asks for her help in determining whether Finn Kelly (Rob Mills) is lying about having amnesia, as Beverly is now a specialist in psychological trauma caused by brain injuries. Paul also has \\"an ulterior motive\\" for contacting Beverly, as he wants to be close to those who had a connection with Jim, who he saw in a vision at Christmas. Beverly returns the following month to lead a hypnotherapy session with Andrea Somers (Madeleine West). She later helps Andrea's mother Heather Schilling (Kerry Armstrong) to recall the traumatic birth of her daughters. Producers later paired Beverly with Clive Gibbons, shortly after ending his relationship with Sheila Canning. Beverly and Clive attend a wine-tasting event, which \\"goes awry\\" when Beverly accidentally bumps into Sheila, who, believing it was deliberate, then throws wine over Beverly. Sheila's jealousy leads her to gatecrash a dinner party that David Tanaka (Takaya Honda) and Aaron Brennan (Matt Wilson) are throwing for Beverly and Clive, as she wants to know more about their relationship. This then leads to a love triangle storyline, as Clive kisses Sheila when he walks her back home. The pair have an affair for a few weeks, until Clive eventually breaks up with Beverly. However, when Sheila apologises to Beverley about the affair, it emerges that Clive only mentioned that he as reuniting with Sheila. A \\"scorned\\" Beverley pours a bucket of manure over Sheila's head in revenge. Claire Crick of What's on TV questioned whether this would lead to Beverly's exit, saying \\"With Beverley's life torn apart by Clive and Sheila's lies, is this the last we have seen of her? Or is her manure dumping just the start of her plan to get revenge?\\" The character returns the following year. Storylines Beverly accepts an invitation from Hilary Robinson, to come to Erinsborough for a visit. Hilary tries to set Beverly and her cousin, Jim Robinson up together and Beverly falls for Jim. She sets up a surgery in the medical practice following the departure of Clive Gibbons and moves to Erinsborough permanently. Beverly helps deliver Daphne Clarke's (Elaine Smith) son, Jamie (S.J. Dey), after she goes into labour while on a fishing trip with her husband Des (Paul Keane), Jim and Beverly. Beverly's former boyfriend Stephen Armstrong (Peter Adams) comes back into her life and she chooses him over Jim. However, Stephen is violent towards her and she throws him out. Beverly begs Jim to take her back and he proposes to her. Beverly and Jim marry at Jim's house on Valentine's Day. Their honeymoon plans are dashed when Beverly's niece and nephew, Katie (Sally Jensen) and Todd Landers (Kristian Schmid) run away. When they are found, they reveal that their parents Annette (Tania Uren) and Bob (Robin Harrison; Bruce Kilpatrick) are having marital problems. Beverly and Jim agree to let Katie and Todd stay with them. Beverly worries if Jim's mother-in-law Helen Daniels will accept her, however, Helen is happy that Jim has found someone. Beverly asks Jim if they can try for a baby, but Jim is reluctant after having raised four children of his own. However, he agrees and Beverly discovers she is pregnant, but she suffers a miscarriage after being mugged on the way home from the surgery. When Debra Turner (Daisy Cameron), a young single mother leaves her baby son, Rhys (Anna and Evie Kasmatis) at Beverly's surgery, Beverly takes the child home and decides to apply for legal guardianship of him. However, Debra returns to town with the child's father, Adam Delaney (Joel Richardson) and they begin blackmailing Beverly. Jim finds out when he notices that large amounts of money is missing from their bank account. Beverly tells him everything and Jim calls the police. Rhys is taken away and put up for adoption. Beverly's former partner Ewan O'Brien (Peter Sumner) asks her to help with a research paper and Jim becomes jealous of him. The tension between Beverly and Jim eventually forces Beverly to take a reluctant Todd and move to the flat above her surgery. Beverly then discovers she is pregnant again and she reconciles with Jim, but she miscarries again. She is told that she cannot carry a child to full term. When Ewan asks Beverly to join him in Perth, Beverly decides to leave Erinsborough. Just before she leaves, Jim tells her that he wants to remain friends. Beverly and Jim divorce the following year. Years later, when Annalise Hartman (Kimberly Davies) returns to Ramsay Street to show the residents a documentary she has made, Beverly features in it and she says she owes her professional confidence to her time on Ramsay Street. Beverly returns to Erinsborough after nearly thirty years away to meet with Paul and assess Finn Kelly, who is believed to be suffering from retrograde amnesia. Beverly asks Paul why he contacted her, and he tells her that he knows she has changed her speciality to the psychiatric effects of serious brain injuries. She presses him further and he explains that he has been thinking about everyone connected with Jim. After talking with Finn, Beverly recommends that they tell him the circumstances that led to him being hospitalised. Beverly then tells Finn that he was pushed off a cliff by Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) during an altercation. Beverly carries out an EEG on Finn and she is confident of the amnesia diagnosis. Beverly is called to give her medical opinion about Finn's brain injury and memory loss at his sentencing hearing. Beverly explains that the head injuries Finn suffered while he was held hostage some years before caused an aneurysm in his brain, and that the trauma from the torture he endured likely led to his destructive personality. Beverly says that Finn was not born a psychopath and that his amnesia diagnosis is conclusive. Beverly bonds with Paul's son and fellow doctor David Tanaka over Finn's case, and thinks psychiatry or neurology could be a good speciality for him. Beverly meets with Andrea Somers at Lassiters Hotel for a hypnotherapy session, and causes her to recall a memory from her childhood. Beverly goes to a wine tasting at The 82 with her date, Clive Gibbons. She bumps into Clive's former partner Sheila Canning, spilling her wine. Sheila believes that Beverly did it deliberately and she throws a glass of wine at her. Beverly congratulates David on his research paper about Finn, and asks if he would like to speak at a neuropsychology symposium in Canberra. David invites Beverly and Clive over for dinner, which is interrupted by Sheila. David's husband Aaron Brennan admits that Sheila wanted him to get intel on Beverly and Clive, and Beverly calls out Sheila's childish behaviour. Clive supports Beverly when she learns her niece has been in a car accident. A few weeks later, Clive breaks up with Beverly for Sheila. The two women meet in the complex and Sheila admits that she and Clive have actually been having an affair, leading Beverly to dump a bucket of manure over her head. Reception Beverly was named as a \\"firm favourite with viewers\\" in John Kercher's 1989 book, Neighbours: Facts, Features, Interviews With Your Favourite TV Stars.Kercher 1989, p.61. Kercher also named Beverly's relationship with Jim as \\"an intriguing storyline\\". Ruth Deller named Beverly as Ramsay Street's \\"superdoc\\". In another feature, Lowculture called Beverly the \\"resident awesome all-powerful Neighbours doctor who came in between Clive Gibbons and Karl Kennedy\\".

Plot summary On a winter night in Antaris, Tamen, the Guardian of the Wall, and other priestesses approach the ice Wall that surrounds Antaris. A priestess drugs herself, whereupon the other priestesses sing a hole into the wall. The drugged priestess is sealed inside. Characters Calwyn, Mica, and Trout are traveling to Antaris, Calwyn's home, hoping that the priestesses may restore Calwyn's lost powers of chantment, by which she was able to manipulate wind, ice, animals, and living systems. Upon reaching the Wall, Mica uses the Clarion of the Flame, a magical object used to invoke fire, to burn a hole into the Wall. The drugged priestess is revealed, whereupon Calwyn tries to heal her, but does not succeed. The three notice other corpses encased in the Wall, which Calwyn attributes to a failure to entomb them according to custom. The three proceed to the priestesses' Dwellings. When reaching the Dwellings, Calwyn enters the kitchen where she sees a now crippled Lia, a revered priestess and milk healer. Lia warns Calwyn that Tamen will hunt Calwyn down and seal her into the Wall with the other priestesses; having contracted an ailment called snow-sickness, they were put into the Wall in hopes of appeasing their goddess Taris, who would presumably restore spring. Marna, the High Priestess, has died and Tamen has been promoted to High Priestess in her place. Tamen then appears and accuses Calwyn of bringing the cruel intruder Samis, the endless winter, and the snow- sickness to their homeland. Calwyn argues that she has the right to return home. Tamen sings ice onto Trouts face, whereupon Mica uses the Clarion to melt the ice and attack Tamen. This sets the kitchen on fire. The three flee and are rescued by Ursca, the infirmarian, who takes them to an abandoned, lightning-struck barn where in the rafters is a snow-sick Marna, apparently alive. It is revealed that when Marna contracted snow-sickness, Ursca proclaimed that Marna had already died and hid her in the barn to prevent Marna from being sealed into the wall. Ursca leaves the three, whereafter Calwyn reprimands Mica for using the Clarion as a weapon. This quarrel upsets both girls. Calwyn sleeps; later, she awakens to find Marna speaking with great difficulty. Calwyn tries to calm her; Marna tells Calwyn that the world is broken but can be mended. She speaks of the Wheel, which is an object of power, and of the mysterious Tenth Power (of chantment, which is used through specific songs) before she falls asleep. Gilly, a priestess who was formerly frivolous but has become wiser, comes in the morning to help Marna and there befriends Mica. At night, Calwyn sneaks out to visit Lia, who reveals that she believes that Calwyn will put an end to the snow-sickness. It is also revealed that Marna holds the same opinion. While Calwyn, Mica, and Trout travel to Antaris, Darrow, Tonno, and Halaasa travel to Gellan, where they encounter the ex-princess Keela. Darrow, while investigating an enclosure of sick chanters, contracts the snow-sickness himself. Later he and the others, including Keela, rendezvous with Calwyn, who has left Antaris and is in search of a missing piece of the Wheel. During the further travels of the combined party, Keela secretly relays information to her half-brother Samis, who is a sorcerer bent on achieving power over others. Subsequently, the travelers enter the Veiled Lands, which are a region unknown to Calwyn's people but legendary among Halasaa's. Their journey continues underground, culminating at the mysterious Knot of Waters, where Calwyn embraces her own death to save Keela from drowning. This sacrifice revives Calwyn, restores her powers of chantment, and creates a sibling-like bond between the two women. The Clarion of the Flame is lost in the Knot and never again used. The travelers are met by some of Halaasa's people, who teach them the true history of their world, wherein it is revealed that the snow-sickness is part of a larger pattern of entropy taking place all over Tremaris. Whereas originally all the songs of chantment overlapped, each one strengthening the others, a war between the Tree People and the Voiced Ones (see below) caused the peoples who used them, and therefore the chantments themselves, to separate. It is suggested that the abuse of chantments, practiced during the war, caused chantment to fall into disfavor everywhere. The connections between songs, people, lands, etc. became weaker and more lost. After this meeting, Calwyn is captured by Samis, who desires to heal Tremaris so that it will not be destroyed before he can conquer it. He keeps her a prisoner in the long-abandoned city-spacecraft called Spareth, which is the means by which the Voiced Ones (colonists from another planet, presumably Earth) arrived on Tremaris millennia before the story begins, trains her in advanced uses of chantment surpassing her previous abilities, and additionally reveals to her the Tenth Power mentioned by Marna. This is the Power of Signs, a code by which the songs of chantment may be written and learned. A minor romance occurs between the two of them during this time, culminating and terminating when Samis and Calwyn use their chantments to empower Spareth, sending it into interplanetary space. Calwyn, now revealed as the legendary Singer of All Songs, remains on Tremaris, while Samis flies inside Spareth, intent on reaching its port of origin. Ultimately, Calwyn must unite Tree People and Voiced Ones in a common need. In this she succeeds. All the people who had contracted snow-sickness, including Darrow, are healed. The peoples are united in harmony, and a new, better world begins. Characters Calwyn the 18-year-old protagonist; a priestess of Antaris. Once an incredibly talented chanter capable of singing nearly all of the chantments, she has lost her abilities as well as her confidence, though not her compassion, later she regains her Chantments when she was empowered with water infused with the power of Becoming. Calwyn uses her other abilities to save Tremaris, the world of which the region of Antaris is part, and by chance is granted her chantment anew. Calwyn learns that she is both a Voiced One and a Tree Person. She becomes the Singer of All Songs, a long-prophesied being, and unites the Tree People and Voiced Ones in the Dance of Healing to give magic and health back to Tremaris. It is implied at the ending of the book that Calwyn is pregnant with Darrow's child. Calwyn is also the lost twin sister of Halasaa. Darrow a 28-year-old ironcrafter, raised on the seas. He was abducted as a child and raised in the Black Palace of Hathara, the enclave of the sorcerers in Merithuros, but left when his friend Samis sought to conquer Tremaris. He now seeks Samis, to end his reign of terror before it can become total. He contracts the snow-sickness and steadily loses his powers, but is saved in the end. His great desire, second to that of thwarting Samis, is to be with Calwyn. Samis a minor prince of the Merithuran Empire who sought to be Emperor of all Tremaris by becoming the Singer of All Songs. He manipulates Calwyn into regaining her chantment and then kidnaps her. He teaches her the chantments he has learned and how to read an ancient language which can preserve the chantments. He and Calwyn have a minor romance during this time, something that Calwyn had come to regret. Overall, Samis appears to have grown wiser since his appearance in The Singer of All Songs. He no longer seeks to dominate all chanters and chantment, but rather to facilitate them and bring peace to Tremaris. Later, Calwyn sends Spareth, the spaceship that brought the ancestors of the Voiced Ones to Tremaris, back to its port of origin (presumably Earth), with Samis on board. Tonno a fisherman from Kalysons and captain of the boat Fledgewing. Tonno has many times aided in Calwyn's quest, though he himself is not a chanter and relies on his massive build and strength. It is implied he has a crush on the deceitful ex-princess Keela, to preserve whose safety he is often shown acting throughout the novel. Trout a 17-year-old former student of the weapon-building colleges of Mithates. Trout now uses his intellect to build practical items, including a navigational compass and a wheeled chair. His wits replace his lack of chantment. Trout has little love of nature, but is very loyal. Around the end of the book it is stated that he is in love with Mica. Mica a 16-17-year-old windworker from the isles of Firthana, sold to pirates to sing wind for the sails. She accompanies Calwyn, who rescued her from slavery. Mica suffers as a result of Calwyn's unpleasant moods. Mica eventually decides to remain in Antaris, as she is greatly liked amongst the priestesses. Mica is eventually killed by a spear during the fight between the rebel Tree People and the priestesses of Antaris. Calwyn, saddened by this loss, decides that she and Darrow will name their first daughter Mica in memoriam her friend. Halasaa an 18-year-old Tree Person; one of a voiceless, telepathic, secluded race of humanoids. He was sent away from his homeland of Spiridrell as punishment for his decision to guide Calwyn, and has accompanied her since then to many places. He is keenly sensitive to natural environments, very compassionate, and strongly inuitive. Halasaa and Calwyn are capable of the Power of Becoming, by which a damaged system is healed. He avoids the snow-sickness and leads his friends to the caves where the Tree People stay in the winter. Halasaa and Calwyn there discover that they are fraternal twins. He leads Calwyn's party to the place called the Knot of Waters and helps Calwyn teach the singers to dance and the dancers to sing. In the end, he himself begins to sing. Keela the Third (and most attractive) Princess of Merithuros. All her schemes have been for her beloved half-brother Samis, with whom she is implied to have an incestuous relationship. Keela is known to change her loyalties as they benefit or harm her, leaving others ignorant of whether she can be trusted. She and Calwyn become \\"sisters\\" when they fall into the Knot of Waters, immersion in which restores to Calwyn her chantments and changes Keela for the better. Thereafter she remains on Calwyn's side. Tamen the Guardian of the Wall of Antaris. Tamen became High Priestess after Marna's supposed death. In an effort to please the goddess Taris, Tamen entombed the snow-sick in the ice Wall; but this failed to produce the desired effect. She later loses title as High Priestess. Her fate is unknown, though it seems she may have committed suicide by drinking the poison called bitterthorn. Tamen often appears cruel, possibly as a result of frustration. Marna the former High Priestess; Calwyn's dear friend, who assumed a maternal role in Calwyn's life. When Marna contracted snow-sickness, Ursca hid her so that she would not be sealed into the Wall. Marna teaches Calwyn the dark chantments -- chantments of destruction -- before she dies. Against custom, Marna is buried in a normal graveyard rather than in the sacred valley. Briaali a Tree Person who believes in the possibility of peace between the Tree People and Voiced Ones. She is one of several, among whom she is leader. Briaali helps Calwyn and company after Calwyn enters the Knot of Waters. Lia once a revered priestess and milk healer; now crippled as a result of falling from the Wall of Antaris. She supports Calwyn and is later made the new High Priestess in place of Tamen. Halasaa heals her so that she is capable of walking again. Sibril a young male Tree Person who despises the Voiced Ones and wishes to reclaim his people's ancestral land. He leads an attack on the Wall by making a large bonfire to burn it. After the battle, he is shunned by his fellow Tree People, though welcomed by Calwyn. Calida is Calwyn's mother. In her youth, Calida left Antaris by means of the river that runs beneath the Wall. She then traveled to the Wildlands, where she married the Tree Person Halwi and gave birth to Halasaa and Calwyn. Since Calwyn could sing and Halasaa could not, Calida chose to return to Antaris with Calwyn, so that her daughter could have a \\"normal\\" life. Calida died in Antaris, shortly after her return. Halwi is Halasaa and Calwyn's father. It is from his side of the lineage that the Power of Becoming is inherited. Halwi is known to have died before Calwyn's return to the Wildlands. Ursca is the infirmarian at Antaris. A dumpy and fussy woman who holds opinions to extent beyond reasonable limit, but holds positive interests at heart. Gilly a former friend of Calwyn's, known to be frivolous, foolish, and prone to flirt. In the third book, she is wiser than before. Locations Antaris: a community of priestesses enclosed by a high ice wall, built originally as a refuge from bloodshed and tumult. Its High Priestess is matriarch of the society. Until the arrival of Samis in search of Darrow, custom held that the Wall, which was controlled by ice chantments, be opened only to traders, and seldom so. A sacred \\"Blazetree\\" stands in a valley, where it holds a ceremonial function. The community is organized into a nearly self- sustaining monastic structure. It is built on land from which the Tree People were driven, and later becomes the first site of interracial harmony between Tree People and Voiced Ones. The Wildlands: The forested domain of the Tree People. It is south of Antaris and easteast of the Veiled Lands. The only major city mentioned in the books is Spiridrell, Halasaa's home until his meeting of Calwyn. The coast of the Wildlands is marked as \\"Uncharted\\" on the map of Tremaris featured by the 2003 edition of The Waterless Sea. Spareth: Originally a gigantic spacecraft that brought the ancestors of the Voiced Ones, who had by then already learned chantment, to the planet Tremaris. Thereafter the Voiced Ones became, as is stated in The Tenth Power, an integral part of the planet's ecosystems, as did the chantments they bore. The vehicle of their coming, Spareth, later became known as a strange city. It was here that Samis attempted to command all chantment, and here that he kept Calwyn during their time as teacher and student. Ultimately, Samis set out to commandeer Spareth and travel with it to its port of origin (presumably Earth). Calwyn refused to go with him, but used her chantments to send the machine to his destination. It, like many others of the Voiced Ones' inventions, is activated and controlled by chantment. Doryus: This is, throughout most of the story, the center of all piracy in Tremaris. It is a small archipelago, located northnorth of the Small Isles; east of the continent including Antaris and Wildlands; westwest of the island including Baltimar, Cragonlands, and Rengan; northwest of Merithuros; south of Firthana; and southeast of the Lakelands. Doryus, along with other islands in the Great Sea of Tremaris, is the home of the chanters of wind after the powers and/or their workers were divided. The Veiled Lands: A place of great magic, which is greatest of all in the Knot of Waters. A network of caves exists here, wherein are crystalline walls of many colors and patterns of color. It is suggested that the ruby of the Ring of Lyonssar--a treasure of Merithuros owned by the commander of the sorcerers there--was mined from one of these. A cold, pure river runs through the caves, culminating in the Knot of Waters. The Knot of Waters: A place where three whirlpools coincide. Magnetism is confounded here. It is the most sacred place in Tremaris, being older than the songs of chantment and more powerful than Spareth. Here, Keela and Calwyn nearly drown. They lose the fire-calling trumpet called the Clarion of the Flame in the waters; Calwyn, however, embraces the waters to save Keela, and so is preserved herself. Her immersion in the Knot of Waters gives her the power of chantment, which she had sacrificed in The Waterless Sea to restore harmony to Merithuros. Merithuros: Home of the chanters of iron. It is located east of the Wildlands; south of Firthana and Doryus; south of Baltimar; and southeast of the Small Isles. When a schism caused by war divided the chanters and their powers, seven clans of people fled to Merithuros, where they built an empire. The empire was later overthrown and a republic built at the insistence of Darrow. Until then, Merithuros remained a desert, scarred by human carelessness. Thereafter, Calwyn's sacrifice (see above) restored the land's health to a small extent. Kalysons: The plains which became home to the chanters of the Power of Beasts after the war mentioned above. Located on the Bay of Sardi, northeast of the Wildlands (being part of the same continent) and east of Mithates. Mithates: Home to the chanters of fire after the war. Located west of Kalysons and northeast of Antaris. It is known for the colleges where students are trained to make weapons. Trout was a student there before his joining with Calwyn and Darrow. Because of over-reliance on technology, Mithates as a nation had largely forgotten its magic by the time of The Singer of All Songs. Its people are frequently shown harming each other. Gellan: The home of the chanters of seeming (illusion) after the war. Located north of the nations surrounding the Bay of Sardi; northwest of the Small Isles; west of Firthana; southwest of the Outer Isles; and south of the Frozen Sea. 2005 Australian novels Fantasy novels ","title":"The Tenth Power"},{"id":"5751212","text":"Botafogo, also sometimes spelt as Bota-fogo or Bota Fogo, is a dance step in Samba.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology‚ÄìHead and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) is one of the largest of the world's many professional associations for medical specialists, with nearly 12,000 specialists in the area of otolaryngology (otorhinolaryngology) - caring for the ears, nose, and throat and surgery of the head and neck. The medical disorders treated by these physicians are among the most common that afflict all Americans, young and old. They include chronic ear infection, sinusitis, snoring and sleep apnea, hearing loss, allergies and hay fever, swallowing disorders, nosebleeds, hoarseness, dizziness, and head and neck cancer.  Membership  The Academy represents the interests of more than 12,000 ENT physicians worldwide and their patients. Membership categories range from board certified Physicians to Residents. Special rates are available for Military/Government and International Members. Membership benefits include a subscription to a scientific peer-monthly journal, the ability to participate in the Reg-ent ENT Clinical Data Registry, access to the global community via ENTConnect ‚Äì the private social network, humanitarian opportunities and ongoing CME education. History The organization began in 1896 as the Western Ophthalmological, Otological, Laryngological and Rhinological Association (\\"Western\\" referred to the Western United States). In 1898, the association became known as the Western Ophthalmologic and Oto- Laryngologic Association. In 1903, it was renamed again to reflect its nationwide membership as the American Academy of Ophthalmology and Oto- Laryngology (AAOO). By 1962 there was recognition that the specialties of ophthalmology and otolaryngology were diverging enough to warrant separate professional associations. By the early 1970s, some separation of offices and functions was in place. The AAOO was incorporated in 1978, and was dissolved the following year after the membership voted to create an American Academy of Otolaryngology and an American Academy of Ophthalmology in its stead. The American Academy of Otolaryngology existed for 2 years before adding \\"Head and Neck Surgery\\" to its name, yielding the American Academy of Otolaryngology‚ÄìHead and Neck Surgery in 1980. In 1981, the American Council of Otolaryngology (ACO), which had formed in the 1960s for purposes outside the scope of the original educational organization (such as lobbying), merged with the American Academy of Otolaryngology‚ÄìHead and Neck Surgery.

In Peru, the treaty was championed by Toledo, and supported to different extents by President-elect Alan Garc√≠a and candidates Lourdes Flores and Valent√≠n Paniagua. The 2006 election's runner-up Ollanta Humala has been its most vocal critic. Humala's Union for Peru won 45 of 120 seats in Congress, the largest share by a single party, prompting the debate and ratification of the agreement before the new legislature was sworn in. Some Congressmen-elect interrupted the debate after forcibly entering Congress, in an attempt to stop the agreement ratification. Critics of the Peru TPA say the pact will worsen Peru's problems with child labor and weak labor rights, and expose the country's subsistence farmers to disruptive competition with subsidized U.S. crops. Additionally, critics contend that Dubai Ports World will be able to use its Peruvian subsidiary to obtain rights to operate U.S. ports. Animal rights groups have opposed this legislation due to the possibility of spreading factory farming practices through Latin America, increasing U.S. pork and poultry exports, and mining development that causes deforestation and habitat loss for animals.Tamara Matheson, Alex Ross, and Joseph Martinez, The US-Peru Free Trade Agreement: Protecting Corporate Investors' \\"Right‚Äù To Exploit The Environment & Animals.

Protests by indigenous communities in the Amazon against the execution of the free trade agreement, and related new foreign investors accessing rights to indigenous lands, have been deadly.

Indigenous groups in Peru's Amazon are demanding that their land rights are acknowledged by national government, as well as being able to participate and be consulted on decisions or legislation that could affect them. A majority feel anger towards the fact that they were not consulted about the series of decrees passed by the government after the implementation of the FTA with the US. Between January 2008 and June 2009, the government auctioned 7,700 square miles of land for mining, including forest area that is the ancestral home of the Awajun and Wampis indigenous groups.CooperAcci√≥n, Fedepaz and Grufides, \\"Informe Observatorio de Conflictos Mineros en el Per√∫,\\" July 2009, Available at: http://www.muqui.org/observatorio/enero_junio_2009/index.html.

Indigenous land as well as parts of the Amazon rainforest are being lost at an alarming rate because of this activity. In October 2007 the AIDESEP, a Federation Representing 350,000 Indigenous Peoples in Amazon Region, sent a letter to congress and made the following statement: \\"The FTA will give incentives for further and irreversible destruction of virgin rainforest, which will in turn increase global warming and displace our communities from their home territories‚Ä¶ Provisions contained in the Peru FTA are directly incentivizing this massive takeover that is threatening our livelihoods and leading to irreversible destruction of virgin rainforest\\".Chota, Alberto Pizango. \\"Federation Representing 350,000 Indigenous Peoples in Amazon Region Urges Opposition to U.S. ‚Äì Peru Free Trade Agreement (FTA).\\" AIDESEP Letter, Interethnic Association for the Development of the Peruvian Amazon (AIDESEP), 30 Oct. 2007, www.citizen.org/sites/default/files/aidesepletterenglish-spanish.pdf.

It also tours its productions on a regular basis. Formation The Hull Truck Theatre Company was founded in 1971 by actor musician Mike Bradwell when he could not find work. He placed an advertisement in Time Out magazine which read, \\"Half-formed theatre company seeks other half\\". Its first production, Children of the Lost Planet played to meagre audiences, as did the next, Last of the Great Love Goddesses. The company began to devise plays for children. Touring out of its Coltman Street base in Hull, where company members lived and rehearsed, Hull Truck started to receive acclaim for its children's work. It was at the same time devising shows that were being performed in working men's clubs and as late night cabaret. Bradwell, who insisted that all the actors play musical instruments, described the approach as \\"provocative and challenging, but above all, entertaining.‚Äù Music was at the heart of their work, along with an underlying sense of anarchy. In 1974 the company devised The Knowledge and, although over half the audience walked out at the play's premiere at the Forum Theatre in Manchester, the critical praise of Guardian reviewer Robin Thornber led to the Bush Theatre taking an interest and staging the production. Hull Truck in Spring Street Spring Street Theatre, Hull, 2009. This venue was the company's base for 26 years.In April 1983 the Hull Truck Company made the Spring Street Theatre its home. Originally converted from St Stephen's church hall (the church itself had been bombed in the Second World War), this tiny 150-seat theatre space was known as The Hull Arts centre where Hull playwright Alan Plater co-founded the Humberside Theatre in 1970. The theatre had closed in 1981. From 1983 it was known as the Hull Truck Theatre. John Godber became artistic director in 1984 although at first he was unaware of how much the Hull Truck Theatre was struggling financially. He had been making a good living as a teacher but the idea of being able to produce some of his own works led him to accept the post. He decided that the best way to improve sales and the success of the company was to write a play relevant to its audiences. He wrote \\"Up n' Under\\" a play about the rugby league in Hull which proved to be a success. One of Hull Truck's most performed and famous plays is John Godber's \\"Bouncers\\". This celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2007 and was the final play to be performed before moving to a new venue. A new home in Ferensway In 2006 work had begun on a new 440-seat theatre in Ferensway, Hull, as part of the St. Stephen's development. Specially built for the Hull Truck Company, funded by the Arts Council, Kingston Upon Hull City Council and the European Regional Development Fund, the theatre was completed three years later at a cost of around ¬£15 million. The first production was John Godber's play Funny Turns which opened on 25 April 2009. Under the two-year tenure of artistic director Gareth Tudor Price, the Hull Truck Theatre hosted the launch of Hull's Larkin 25 Festival in June 2010, marking 25 years since the poet's death with 25 weeks of events. The launch included poetry from Mario Petrucci, a performance from the band All What Jazz (named after Philip Larkin's 1985 book ) and provided the setting for the annual Philip Larkin Society Distinguished Guest Lecture, given that year by actor and dramatist Barrie Rutter. The following month, following a review of Hull Truck's management structure, Paul Marshall became operations director and Andrew Smaje was appointed to fill the newly created role of chief executive to develop the theatre's programme and to entice new audiences. Smaje took up his role that October, moving on from a decade at the Theatre Royal, Bath. Notable seasons =40th Anniversary Celebrations= In 2012, Hull Truck Theatre celebrated its 40th birthday. This year's production included a revival of the play Once Upon a Time in Wigan starring Craige Els, the premiere of Matt Hartley's Sixty Five Miles with Ian Bleasdale, a new production of Krapps Last Tape by Samuel Beckett and a UK tour of DNA by Dennis Kelly starring James Alexandrou Mike Bradwell, who had gone on to be Artistic Director at the Bush Theatre (1996-2007), returned to Hull Truck in March 2012 to perform excerpts from the early Hull Truck shows in celebration the 40th anniversary of the company's formation. He was joined by fellow performers from those days - the original Truckers - John Lee, Steve Halliwell, Dave Greaves, Alan Williams, Cas Patton, Rachel Bell, Mary East, Pete Nicholson, David Ambrose, Steve Marshall and David Hatton. Later that year the company received a TMA nomination for The Renee Stepham Award for Best Presentation of Touring Theatre. Touring productions that year included The Lady in the Van by Alan Bennett, DNA by Dennis Kelly and The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde adapted by Nick Lane. In October 2012 Hull city centre was awarded Purple Flag status for the quality of the city's nightlife. The Association of Town Centre Management praised Hull Truck Theatre in particular \\"for its outstanding contribution\\" to entertainment for city centre users. In January 2013 Hull Truck Theatre were nominated for Best Visiting Production at the Manchester Theatre Awards for DNA by Dennis Kelly. In April 2013 Mike Bradwell returned to direct for the company for the first time in over 30 years, directing the world premiere of Queen of the Nile by Tim Fountain. In May 2013 Mark Babych was appointed artistic director of the company. In April 2014, it was reported that the theatre had received ¬£400,000 in grants from Arts Council England and Hull City Council. In November 2015, Hull Truck Theatre won the Welcome to Yorkshire White Rose Awards' Arts and Culture award for their contribution to the planning of Hull UK City of Culture 2017. In November 2017, Hull Truck Theatre won the Welcome to Yorkshire White Rose Awards' Arts and Culture award for the second time. In November 2019, Hull Truck Theatre won the Welcome to Yorkshire White Rose Awards' Arts and Culture award for the third time. In 2019 Hull Truck Theatre also took home the Silver Award for Accessible and Inclusive Tourism at the White Rose Awards. =Hull UK City of Culture 2017= Hull Truck Theatre delivered its 'Year of Exceptional Drama programme' for Hull UK City of Culture 2017, working with partners including the Royal Shakespeare Company, Northern Broadsides and The Market Theatre of Johannesburg. In June 2017, Hull Truck Theatre were shortlisted for the Welcome to Yorkshire White Rose Awards' Arts and Culture award for their Year of Exceptional Drama programme for Hull UK City of Culture 2017. In September 2017, Hull Truck Theatre were nominated for the Achievement in Marketing/Audience Development award at the UK Theatre Awards. In May 2018, the company hit the headlines when their associate company Silent Uproar cancelled their production of Ununited Kingdom. The play dealt with far-right issues. The staging of the play in London was cancelled in its entirety. References Other sources *Meyer- Dinkgrafe, Daniel. The Professions in Contemporary Drama.

The highways connecting through the circle provided access to drivers navigating to and between the New Jersey Turnpike, the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge and points on the Jersey Shore. History For years after the construction of the one-lane Marlton Circle in the 1940s, the area was a sparsely populated farming town. While the roads in the area had long been lightly traveled, the population of Evesham Township had doubled since the 1970s and the increased housing and commercial density placed greater traffic stress on the Marlton Circle. In the summer of 1974, the circle was modified when Route 73 was cut through and traffic signals were installed. Congestion has plagued this intersection for years, routinely backing up as far as a mile on summer afternoons. A motorist described the interchange as being like an airport in a resident neighborhood, saying it's \\"not a traffic circle, it's a non-traffic circle\\". left A plan to eliminate the circle was announced in 2002 as part of a $26 million project that would address congestion at the circle, which was at the time \\"the third most dangerous intersection in the state\\". By 2008, plans to eliminate the circle, described by The Philadelphia Inquirer as \\"one of the most dangerous intersections in South Jersey\\", and replace it with an overpass over Route 70 were continuing, a task made more difficult by the daily traffic volume of 90,000 vehicles passing through the circle. Construction broke ground on April 8, 2009. On May 2, 2010, new traffic patterns were put into effect on Route 70 and 73, and the circle was closed off to traffic and replaced with a temporary at-grade intersection until the overpass was completed. The circle elimination project also made improvements and new traffic patterns to local roads nearby, including the intersections of Old Marlton Pike (CR 600), East Main Street (CR 620) and Centre Boulevard. New service roads were constructed to provide access for the several businesses in the area, as well as installing new signage and new traffic signals where needed. On June 25, 2011, the circle was officially eliminated as the Route 73 southbound overpass opened to traffic. The northbound lanes began using the new bridge in March 2011. The entire project, including signage, landscaping, pavement resurfacing, road improvements, and installation of traffic signals was completed in November 2011. The total cost of the project was $33 million.

The diner, originally located at the junction of Sixth and Federal Streets in Camden, opened in 1946 and was originally called Mom and Pop's. It became Olga's Diner when it moved to a location across the street in 1951; and finally moved to the Marlton Circle in 1960. It was put up for sale in 2005, and finally closed in December 2008.

Entering service in 1918 near the end of the First World War, the vessel had a short career with the RCN, being transferred to the Department of Marine and Fisheries in 1922. Arleux was used for fisheries patrol off the east coast of Canada until 1939, when the ship was reacquired by the RCN at the onset of the Second World War. Used as a gate vessel during the war and designated Gate Vessel 16, the ship was sold for mercantile purposes following the war. The ship foundered in 1948 off the coast of Nova Scotia. Design and description The RCN's Battle-class trawlers formed part of the Canadian naval response to Admiralty warnings to Canada about the growing German U-boat threat to merchant shipping in the western Atlantic.Tucker, p. 253 Intended to augment anti-submarine patrols off Canada's east coast, these ships were modelled on contemporary British North Sea trawlers, since the standard types of Canadian fishing vessels were considered unsuitable for patrol work.Tucker, pp. 254, 257 Twelve vessels were ordered on 2 February 1917 from two shipyards, Polson Iron Works of Toronto and Canadian Vickers of Montreal.Johnston et al., p. 417 Those vessels built at Canadian Vickers displaced and were long overall with a beam of and a draught of .Macpherson and Barrie, p. 27 The vessels were propelled by a steam-powered triple expansion engine driving one shaft creating giving the vessels a maximum speed of .Maginley and Collin, p. 67 All twelve trawlers were equipped with a QF 12-pounder 12 cwt naval gun mounted forward. This was considered to be the smallest gun that stood a chance of putting a surfaced U-boat out of action, and they also carried a small number of depth charges.Tucker, p. 257 The trawlers were named after battles of the Western Front during the First World War that Canadians had been involved in. They cost between $155,000 and $160,000 per vessel. Construction and service history Named after the April 1917 Battle of Arleux, the ship was built by Canadian Vickers at Montreal and launched on 9 August 1917. Intended for use during the 1917 shipping season, the construction of the vessels was delayed by the entry of the United States into the war. With higher wages found south of the border, a shortage of skilled labour developed in the shipyards, coupled with a shortage of construction material.Johnston et al., pp. 481‚Äì484 The six vessels ordered from Canadian Vickers were delayed further by difficulty in providing engines for the trawlers.

Armenti√®res entered service in 1918 near the end of the First World War on the Atlantic coast of Canada. Following the war, the ship was transferred to the Department of Marine and Fisheries for a short period before reverting to RCN service in 1923 on the Pacific coast of Canada. The ship sank in 1925, was raised and re-entered service, remaining with the fleet through the Second World War as an examination vessel at Prince Rupert, British Columbia. After the end of the war, the vessel entered mercantile service becoming A.G. Garrish in 1947, later renamed Arctic Rover in 1958, Laforce in 1962 and Polaris in 1973. The ship's registry was deleted in 1991. Design and description The RCN's Battle-class trawlers formed part of the Canadian naval response to Admiralty warnings to Canada about the growing German U-boat threat to merchant shipping in the western Atlantic.Tucker, p. 253 Intended to augment anti-submarine patrols off Canada's east coast, these ships were modelled on contemporary British North Sea trawlers, since the standard types of Canadian fishing vessels were considered unsuitable for patrol work.Tucker, pp. 254, 257 Twelve vessels were ordered on 2 February 1917 from two shipyards, Polson Iron Works of Toronto and Canadian Vickers of Montreal.Johnston et al., p. 417 Those vessels built at Canadian Vickers displaced and were long overall with a beam of and a draught of .Macpherson and Barrie, p. 27 The vessels were propelled by a steam-powered triple expansion engine driving one shaft creating giving the vessels a maximum speed of .Maginley and Collin, p. 67 All twelve trawlers were equipped with a QF 12-pounder 12 cwt naval gun mounted forward. This was considered to be the smallest gun that stood a chance of putting a surfaced U-boat out of action, and they also carried a small number of depth charges.Tucker, p. 257 The trawlers were named after battles of the Western Front during the First World War that Canadians had been involved in. They cost between $155,000 and $160,000 per vessel. Service history Named after the Battle of Armenti√®res, the trawler was built by Canadian Vickers at Montreal and launched on 11 August 1917. Intended for use during the 1917 shipping season, the construction of the vessels was delayed by the entry of the United States into the war. With higher wages found south of the border, a shortage of skilled labour developed in the shipyards, coupled with a shortage of construction material.Johnston et al., pp. 481‚Äì484 The six vessels ordered from Canadian Vickers were delayed further by difficulty in providing engines for the trawlers. The hulls had been finished during Summer 1917. However, the engines did not arrive until the fall.Johnston et al., p. 484 The ship was commissioned on 5 June 1918. Armenti√®res sailed to the east coast where for the 1918 shipping season, all the Battle-class trawlers were assigned to patrol and escort duties based out of Sydney, Nova Scotia.Johnston et al., pp. 543, 645 Following the sinking of the merchant vessel Luz Blanca off Halifax, Nova Scotia, Armenti√®res, and were tasked with hunting for the German submarine , which had been operating off the coast of Nova Scotia.Johnston et al., pp. 635, 643‚Äì644, 665 The Battle class was used for patrol and escort duties off the Atlantic coast of Canada until the end of the war.Johnston et al., p. 645 Along with , and , Armenti√®res accompanied on a trip to the west coast via the Panama Canal in early 1919. Shortly after arriving at Esquimalt, British Columbia, Armenti√®res was refitted to increase its utility as a training ship, with a captain's cabin built abaft the wheelhouse, and two cabins built below the upper deck. The ship was paid off from RCN service on 28 October 1919 and was transferred to the Department of Marine and Fisheries. The vessel was returned to the RCN and was recommissioned in 1923.Maginley and Collin, p. 113 On 2 September 1925 the ship sank in Pipestem Inlet, near Barkley Sound. The vessel was salvaged on 26 October Armenti√®res was recommissioned again in 1926. Frequently functioning as a training ship for the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve, Armenti√®res also performed fisheries patrol duties, including the protection of migrating fur seals against illegal hunting. This enforcement of the North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911 was often carried out in conjunction with sister ships Thiepval and CGS Givenchy, which at the time was serving with the Department of Marine and Fisheries. In the 1930s, Armenti√®res also assisted with hydrographic survey and oceanographic work. Armenti√®res in 1933 at Vancouver Armenti√®res continued her service throughout the interwar years, and by 1934 was the only Battle-class trawler still actively serving with the RCN, although others would return to naval service in 1939. During much of the Second World War, Armenti√®res served as an examination vessel and minesweeper at Prince Rupert, British Columbia. For minesweeping purposes, the aft part of the ship was trimmed. Following the end of the war Armenti√®res was paid off on 8 February 1946. Subsequently, sold as surplus, Armenti√®res was purchased by the Coastal Towing Company of Vancouver on 8 February 1946, who renamed her A.G. Garrish, installed a new Yarrow boiler, and made changes to adapt the ship for towing log rafts and scows.Colledge, p. 59 The vessel was sold to Andys Bay Industries in 1954, keeping the same name. In 1958, the ship was sold again, this time to Arctic Shipping Limited and renamed Arctic Rover. It served partially in the Western Arctic Ocean of the Northwest Territories, Canada. In 1962, the vessel was purchased by Vancouver Tug Boat Company and renamed Laforce. In 1972, the vessel was sold twice and renamed Polaris in 1973. Polaris was sold in 1975 to West Indies Metal Corp and her registry was deleted in 1991.

The Confraternity Bible strives to give a fluent English translation while remaining close to the Latin Vulgate. It is no longer in widespread use since it was supplanted in 1970 by the New American Bible. Translation history Spine of 1957 New Catholic Edition Confraternity Bible The history of the translation project that resulted in the Confraternity Bible is complex and somewhat opaque. In 1941, a revision of Bishop Richard Challoner's version of the Rheims New Testament was released under the following title: > THE NEW TESTAMENT of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Translated from the > Latin Vulgate A Revision of the Challoner-Rheims Version, Edited by Catholic > Scholars Under the Patronage of THE EPISCOPAL COMMITTEE of the CONFRATERNITY > OF CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE The CCD's 1941 translation of the New Testament revised the Challoner-Rheims version in several ways: *It modernized the style of Challoner's Eighteenth Century English. *The CCD used the Clementine edition of the Vulgate as a base, but made use of modern critical texts to improve fidelity to the original source texts. *Where Greek idioms had been translated literally into the Latin Vulgate, it paraphrased the Greek idiom, rather than translating directly from the Latin. Where they retained the Latin rendering, they noted the Greek in a footnote. *In general, it was a freer translation than Challoner's, and more periphrastic, however the translation still leans more toward formal equivalence. *It restored the paragraph formatting of the first edition of the Douay-Rheims Bible, which had been removed in the Challoner Revision. *In order to maintain fidelity to the Greek and Latin source texts, they retained use of second person singular pronouns thee, thou, thy, and thine, together with the -(e)st and -(e)th verb suffixes, but to make it read more like modern English, they dropped the second person plural nominative form Ye and used only the modern you, your, and yours. In so doing, they retained the more accurate translation of the Greek and Latin underlying texts, with a more modern sounding flow. Because it was intended to be used in the liturgy, the translators did not introduce any rendering that would depart from the text of the Latin Vulgate, which before Divino afflante Spiritu in 1943 was regarded as inerrant by some Catholic theologians. Upon release of the CCD's New Testament in 1941, translation work began on the Old Testament. Then, on September 30, 1943, Pope Pius XII issued the encyclical Divino afflante Spiritu which stressed the importance of diligent study of the original languages and other cognate languages, so as to arrive at a deeper and fuller knowledge of the meaning of the sacred texts. Specifically, Pius XII characterized the original language texts as \\"having been written by the inspired author himself\\" and opined that such texts \\"ha[ve] more authority and greater weight than any even the very best translation, whether ancient or modern[.]\\" This pronouncement essentially doomed the CCD's revision of the Douay-Challoner version, which itself was a translation from Latin. Thus, the Church's focus shifted to a completely new translation of the entire Bible with emphasis on original language sources. This is not to say that the CCD's Old Testament translation efforts up to that point were scrapped. Quite to the contrary, they continued, as the CCD's Old Testament from the outset was \\"Translated from the Original Languages with Critical Use of All the Ancient Sources\\" ‚Äì an approach that was presumably in complete accord with the September 1943 encyclical. What is known of the Confraternity's Old Testament translation is that it was completed in stages beginning in 1948 and ending in 1969. Volumes were released serially by St. Anthony Guild Press in New Jersey as they were completed. Their publishing history is as follows: *The Book of Genesis ‚Äì 1948: this was a unique translation, the only one that was revised for the 1970 NAB *The Book of Psalms ‚Äì 1950 and 1955, reprinted 1959 *The Octateuch: Genesis to Ruth ‚Äì 1952 (published as Volume One) *The Sapiential Books (Job to Sirach) ‚Äì 1955 (published as Volume Three ‚Äî with Volume Two left to be filled in later) *The Prophetic Books (Isaias to Malachias) ‚Äì 1961 (published as Volume Four) *The Historical Books ‚Äì Samuel to Maccabees (1 Samuel to Esther; 1 and 2 Maccabees) ‚Äì 1969 (published as Volume Two). These translations formed the basis of what would become the Old Testament portion of the 1970 New American Bible, except for CCD's 1948 translation of the Book of Genesis. Genesis was completely revised before the release of the NAB. Some minor revisions were made to the rest of the books to normalize the anglicized form of formal names throughout the entire text, preferring a direct Hebrew- English instead of Hebrew-Greek/Latin-English rendering. They also dropped the Latin Vulgate/Greek Septuagint Book names (using the Hebrew 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, instead of 1, 2, 3, and 4 Kings, using the Hebraic Isaiah instead of Hellenic-Latinate Isaias, etc.), went with the Hebrew chapter-verse numbering instead of the Greek/Latin (which affects mainly the Books of Psalms and Job, but is also noticeable elsewhere). Lastly, they used the Hebrew- English translated form of the tetragrammaton, using an all capitalized \\"the LORD\\", instead of the Greek/Latin-English \\"the Lord\\". These are the main differences seen between the 1948-1969 Confraternity Old Testament books versus the 1970 NAB OT books, along with various other minor orthographic and grammatical revisions. Given the Confraternity's completion of the Old Testament in 1969 and the NAB's introduction in 1970, there has never been a release of a complete Confraternity Bible (that is, with both Old and New Testaments) featuring all of the Confraternity's translations from 1941 to 1969. The most complete editions include the Confraternity's 1941 New Testament and those portions of the Old Testament that had been translated by 1961, namely the first eight books (the Octateuch - Genesis through Ruth), the seven Sapiential Books (Job through Sirach), and the eighteen Prophetic Books (Isaias through Malachias). Because of the hybrid nature of the various versions of the Confraternity Bible, it has been referred to as the \\"Douay- Confraternity Bible\\", referencing the fact that the Old Testament section was made up partly of books from the Challoner-Douay Old Testament and partly from books translated or revised by the CCD Publishers released \\"Confraternity Bibles\\" up to 1969, always indicating to what extent they featured Confraternity translations of the Old Testament. They typically included some variation on the following description of the edition's Old Testament contents: \\"With the New Confraternity of Christian Doctrine Translation of the First Eight Books, the Seven Sapiential Books, and the Eighteen Prophetic Books of the Old Testament. The balance is in the Douay Version.\\". The Book of Psalms contained in a Confraternity Bible could be one of several versions: The Challoner Psalms, the Pontifical Biblical Institute (PBI) of Rome from 1945 (which in the title page would be labeled \\"a New Translation of the Book of Psalms from the New Latin Version approved by Pope Pius XII\\"), the CCD Psalms of 1950, or the CCD Psalms of 1955. The 1950 CCD Psalms were based on the 1945 PBI version (a new Latin translation of the original Hebrew text requested by Pius XII, the \\"Novum Psalterium\\"). The 1955 CCD Psalter, which with minor revision such as Hebrew instead of Latin chapter and verse numbering and proper names, is also the Psalter used in the 1970 New American Bible, which was translated directly from the Hebrew manuscripts underlying those of the 1945 \\"Novum Psalterium\\". The 1950 and 1955 texts can be distinguished by reference to the first word of Psalm 1, in which the former begins with the word \\"Blessed\\" and the latter, \\"Happy\\".

Biography Formerly known as Trojan (not to be confused with NWOBHM band Tr√∂jan who released the album Chasing the Storm), Shy featured vocalist Tony Mills, Steve Harris (guitars) (not to be confused with Iron Maiden's bass player, Steve Harris), Paddy McKenna (keyboards), Mark Badrick (bass) and drummer Alan Kelly. Their first album, called Once Bitten...Twice..., was released in 1983. Initial reports from Kerrang! were positive. After the release, Mills dropped his David Bowie-esque make up, and Mark Badrick was replaced by former Trouble bassist Roy Davies. Shy made their major label debut on RCA Records with 1985's Brave the Storm. This release gained success despite the single \\"Hold On (To Your Love)\\" being disqualified from the charts, as early copies included a shrink-wrapped T-shirt. Reviews from Kerrang! were more positive, comparing Mill's soaring vocals with those of Geoff Tate, vocalist of Queensr√øche. In the eighteen months that preceded the band's third album, Shy toured with Bon Jovi, Meat Loaf, Twisted Sister, Gary Moore and UFO. The band's 1987 album, Excess All Areas, was recorded in the Netherlands with producer Neil Kernon. The album featured Shy's biggest hit, \\"Break Down the Walls\\", co-written with Don Dokken. The album reached the UK Albums Chart, with Metal Hammer magazine being appreciative. RCA dropped Shy after this album.1989 saw the release of Misspent Youth on MCA. The album, produced by Roy Thomas Baker, was promoted with American and European tours. By 1994, Mills had been replaced by vocalist Jon Wardi Ward, previously in NWOBHM band Sabre and US hair band Madam X. The band's 1994 album, Welcome to the Madhouse was released in Japan by Phonogram but initially failed to get distribution elsewhere. The band released a live album in 1999, recorded in Europe, and two albums containing previously unreleased songs, Let the Hammer Fall and Regeneration. Mills returned to the band in 2000. In 2002, Shy recorded and released an album featuring Mills, Unfinished Business which saw Man drummer Bob Richards replacing Kelly. In 2005, Shy released Sunset and Vine on the MTM Music label. In addition to Mills, Harris and Davis, this album featured Mills' ex Siam colleague Ian Richardson on rhythm guitar, and keyboard player Joe Basketts who had previously worked with Mills on his solo album. In 2006, Mills met with Norwegian rock act TNT, and announced he was leaving Shy to take up the vocalist slot, empty since the announced departure of Tony Harnell. Shy supported TNT on their final tour. Shy originally had planned for Tony O'Hora from Praying Mantis and Andy Scott's Sweet to replace Mills. However, Lee Small, formerly of Surveillance and the supergroup Phenomena, took the helm for a handful of gigs before parting company with Shy in January 2009, he is now once again Shy's vocalist. The band's latest album, entitled simply Shy was released in Japan in September 2011 on the Marquee Avalon label, and in Europe in October on Escape Music. Ian Richardson (previously in Siam) has since left Shy but provided some additional rhythm guitar on the latest release. Steve Harris died of a brain tumour in October 2011. Tony Mills died from pancreatic cancer on September 18, 2019. He was 57 years old. Discography *Once Bitten...Twice...

It consists of a 1,300-seat main auditorium, The Lyric, which regularly hosts large-scale musicals, opera and ballet; a 200-seat studio, The Drum; and a 50-seat studio, The Lab. On a separate site, Theatre Royal Plymouth also has a production and learning centre, TR2, featuring rehearsal studios and workshops for the production of set and costumes. The theatre is a National Portfolio Organisation, receiving regular funding from Arts Council England. A ¬£7 million Regeneration Project was completed in September 2013 with a renovated front of house area and community performance space called The Lab. A bronze sculpture depicting a crouching female actor called Messenger is due to be erected in front of the theatre. History In 1758 a theatre was built at the top of George Street in Plymouth. Originally known as the Theatre, Frankfort-Gate, it adopted the name Theatre Royal after King George III and his family visited it in 1789. Foulston's building of 1813 In 1810 Plymouth Corporation held a competition for the design of a new theatre, hotel and assembly rooms at the bottom of George Street. The competition was won by John Foulston, who built a neo-classical block of buildings between 1811 and 1813. The new Theatre Royal opened in 1813 and could seat 1,192. Foulston's buildings formed a frontage of facing George's Place that was dominated by a portico with -high ionic columns. The theatre was on the west side of this portico, with the hotel and assembly rooms on the east. Foulston used thick walls to separate the auditorium from the foyer, corridors and the hotel next door to minimise the risk of fire damage. The whole inner structure was built of cast iron for the same purpose, and Foulston believed it was the only fireproof theatre in the country. Despite these precautions, the theatre suffered a disastrous interior fire in June 1878; by January 1879 it had been repaired and reopened. The decline in theatre-going caused by the rise in cinema attendance resulted in the building being demolished in 1937. It was replaced by the 2,400-seat Royal Cinema, which opened the following year. The cinema survived the Plymouth Blitz during the Second World War, which destroyed the adjoining hotel and assembly rooms. By 1954 the decline in cinema-going caused by the rise of television led to the cinema's being partly converted back to a theatre and rechristened as the Theatre Royal Cinema. In 1958 it was renamed the ABC Plymouth. It was converted to a triple-screen ABC which opened on 5 May 1977. ABC Cinemas passed to the Cannon Group, then to MGM from 22 May 1992. A management buy-out brought the name ABC back again in the mid-1990s. From 1 August 2006 it was operated by the independent Reel Cinemas chain. The Reel Plymouth Cinema finally closed its doors on Thursday 28 February 2019.http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/24749 On a different site, the current Theatre Royal was designed in 1977 by the Peter Moro Partnership, which had already designed a number of new theatres around the country. Building started in 1979 and the theatre was officially opened on 5 May 1982 by Princess Margaret. The Lyric (the main auditorium) The Lyric seats 1,315 but has a unique ability to compress the auditorium, creating a more intimate performance space of 787. It has a steep auditorium with two galleries and very large proscenium arch. The range of work presented and produced is extensive and includes major touring drama and musical productions, as well as leading opera and dance companies (including the Birmingham Royal Ballet, the Rambert Dance Company, Glyndebourne on Tour and the Welsh National Opera). The Lyric also produces its own drama and musical productions each year, usually with commercial or subsidised partners. The Drum The Drum (capacity ‚Äì 200) specialises in the production of new plays and has a good reputation for its innovative programme. It won the Peter Brook Empty Space Award in 2007. It often collaborates with other subsidised companies and venues such as the Royal Court, ATC, the Lyric Hammersmith, the Bush Theatre, Frantic Assembly, Hampstead Theatre, Paines Plough, the Traverse Theatre and the Tron Glasgow. The Production and Learning Centre, TR2 The Production and Learning Centre, TR2, is on the bank of the River Plym designed by Ian Ritchie Architects. It contains set, costume, prop-making and rehearsal facilities. TR2 provides one of the biggest education and outreach programmes for a regional venue in the UK.

The vessel entered service in 1918 near the end of the First World War and was used for patrolling and escort duties along the Atlantic Coast of Canada. Following the war, Arras was transferred to the Department of Marine and Fisheries where the ship was used as a fisheries patrol vessel. Following the outbreak of the Second World War, the ship re- entered RCN service as a gate vessel. In 1943, the ship was heavily damaged by fire and was broken up in 1957. Design and description The RCN's Battle- class trawlers formed part of the Canadian naval response to Admiralty warnings to Canada about the growing German U-boat threat to merchant shipping in the western Atlantic.Tucker, p. 253 Intended to augment anti-submarine patrols off Canada's east coast, these ships were modelled on contemporary British North Sea trawlers, since the standard types of Canadian fishing vessels were considered unsuitable for patrol work.Tucker, pp. 254, 257 Twelve vessels were ordered on 2 February 1917 from two shipyards, Polson Iron Works of Toronto and Canadian Vickers of Montreal.Johnston et al., p. 417 Those vessels built at Canadian Vickers displaced and were long overall with a beam of and a draught of .Macpherson and Barrie, p. 27 The vessels were propelled by a steam-powered triple expansion engine driving one shaft creating giving the vessels a maximum speed of .Maginley and Collin, p. 67 All twelve trawlers were equipped with a QF 12-pounder 12 cwt naval gun mounted forward. This was considered to be the smallest gun that stood a chance of putting a surfaced U-boat out of action, and they also carried a small number of depth charges.Tucker, p. 257 The trawlers were named after battles of the Western Front during the First World War that Canadians had been involved in. They cost between $155,000 and $160,000 per vessel. Service history Arras was named for the Battle of Arras and constructed by Canadian Vickers at Montreal, launching on 15 September 1917.Macpherson and Barrie, p. 28Johnston et al., p. 484 Intended for use during the 1917 shipping season, the construction of the vessels was delayed by the entry of the United States into the war. With higher wages found south of the border, a shortage of skilled labour developed in the shipyards, coupled with a shortage of construction material.Johnston et al., pp. 481‚Äì484 The six vessels ordered from Canadian Vickers were delayed further by difficulty in providing engines for the trawlers. The hulls had been finished during Summer 1917. However, the engines did not arrive until the fall. The ship was commissioned on 8 July 1918. Arras sailed to the east coast where for the 1918 shipping season, all the Battle-class trawlers were assigned to patrol and escort duties based out of Sydney, Nova Scotia.Johnston et al., pp. 543, 645 The vessel performed these duties until the end of the war and remained in RCN service until 1919. Arras was transferred to the Department of Marine and Fisheries in 1920. and was deployed as a fisheries protection ship on the Atlantic coast.Maginley and Collin, pp. 91, 113 Arras often served as the hospital ship for the fishing fleet on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. On 11 September 1939, Arras returned to RCN service following the outbreak of the Second World War. The trawler was initially stationed at Halifax, Nova Scotia as the gate vessel Gate Vessel 15. In mid-1941 the vessel transferred to Sydney, where, in November 1943, was significantly damaged by fire. In 1949, the vessel was sold to Halifax Shipyards and was broken up in at Halifax in December 1957.Colledge, p. 59 References =Notes= =Citations= =Sources=  * External links * Battle-class trawlers Trawlers of the Royal Canadian Navy Battle-class trawlers World War I naval ships of Canada 1917 ships Auxiliary ships of the Royal Canadian Navy Ships of the Royal Canadian Navy ","title":"HMCS Arras"},{"id":"5751366","text":"Flag of the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) The People's Liberation Army Navy Surface Force is a branch of the People's Liberation Army Navy in China. It consists of all surface warships in operational service with the PLAN. It operates 661 ships. The ships are organized into three fleets: the North Sea Fleet, the East Sea Fleet, and the South Sea Fleet. The People's Liberation Army Navy is turning away from its traditional focus on coastal and littoral warfare and instead prioritising the development of blue water capabilities. This has led to a significant reduction in fleet numbers as the PLAN has replaced a larger number of smaller ships with a smaller number of larger and more capable ships, including destroyers, frigates, corvettes, amphibious warfare ships and large auxiliary ships. Aircraft carriers The PLAN Surface Force currently operates two aircraft carrier: * Type 003 aircraft carrier - 2 under construction. * Type 002 aircraft carrier Shandong - In active service. * Type 001 aircraft carrier Liaoning - In active service. =Development= The 67,000 tonne Liaoning is the first operational aircraft carrier in service with the PLAN. Liaoning, previously known as Varyag, is an Admiral Kuznetsov-class aircraft carrier which the Chinese purchased from Ukraine in 1998 through a private tourist venture in Macau. At the time, Varyag was only 68% completed and stripped of all military equipment as well as her propulsion. After the purchase, Varyag was towed to Dalian, where she underwent extensive refurbishment, coordinated by the Dalian Shipbuilding Industry Company. On 10 August 2011, it was announced that the refurbishment of the new Liaoning was complete, and that the ship was undergoing sea trials.Liaoning was finally commissioned on 25 September 2012. In July 2011, a senior researcher of the Academy of Military Sciences said China needed at least three aircraft carriers for its fleet. During the same month, another Chinese official announced that two aircraft carriers were being built at the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai, the aircraft carriers are reportedly based on a similar design to Liaoning, suggesting a displacement of approximately 65,000 tonnes. A new Chinese variant of the Sukhoi Su-33 fighter aircraft, known as the Shenyang J-15 (or Flying Shark) are expected to fly from the new aircraft carriers. In 2013, Chinese media reported that the PLAN is designing and planning to build a 110,000 tonne 'super aircraft carrier'. Media reports also stated that the current aircraft carriers under construction are based on Liaoning, but would be larger and would displace around 80,000 tonnes. The PLA Navy plans to establish three aircraft carrier battle groups by 2020. Liaoning and China's first domestically built carrier, currently under construction, will be part of the battle groups. One of the battle groups is to be deployed in the East China Sea, while the other two are to be deployed to the South China Sea.China plans military reform to enhance its readiness - The-Japan- news.com, 2 January 2014 On 31 December 2015, it was announced that China was building a second carrier in STOBAR configuration, displacing around 50,000 tonnes, a length of 300m with a capacity of an estimated 50 aircraft. The hull was launched on 26 April 2017 and is estimated to be operational by 2020. PLAN's second aircraft carrier Shandong was put in commission on 17 December 2019, one year earlier than the estimation. Amphibious warfare ships Type 071 amphibious transport dock (Yuzhao-class) The PLAN operates many types of amphibious vessels of various sizes and capabilities: Landing Helicopter Docks (LHDs) * Type 075 (NATO designation Yushen-class)  1 in sea trials, 1 fitting out, 1 under construction Amphibious Transport Docks (LPDs) * Type 071 (NATO designation Yuzhao-class)  7 in active service, 1 fitting out Landing Ship, Tank (LSTs) * Type 072A (NATO designation Yuting III-class)  15 in active service. * Type 072III (NATO designation Yuting II-class)  10 in active service. * Type 072II (NATO designation Yuting-class)  4 in active service. * Type 072 (NATO designation Yukan-class)  3 in active service. Landing Ship, Medium (LSMs) * Type 073 (NATO designation Yudao, Yudeng and Yunshu-class)  13 in active service. * Type 074A (NATO designation Yubei- class)  6 in active service. * Type 074 (NATO designation Yuhai-class)  12 in active service. =Development= The recent construction of the large Yuzhao-class amphibious transport docks (LPDs) (pictured) indicates an important shift toward blue water capabilities for the PLAN. However, the Landing Ship, Tanks (LSTs) of the 072 series still constitute the core of PLAN amphibious capabilities. With approximately 26 confirmed in service, the PLAN possesses the capabilities to conduct amphibious operations in the littoral waters of the South East Asian region, as well as a limited capability in outer sea landings. Most vessels are only capable of transporting troops while some are capable of transporting limited numbers of armored vehicles. In late 2012, it was reported that China may be developing a class of 40,000 to 48,000 tonne landing helicopter docks (LHDs).PLA General admits China developing large amphibious assault ship , November 2012 They will possibly be known as the Type 075 class. Two vessels of this class are known to have been launched with a third believed to be under construction.

With this came a series of warship designs based on the Soviet Navy's destroyers and frigates. The first PLAN destroyers were the Anshan class, directly purchased from the Soviet Union. These were armed with torpedoes and various surface- and air- warfare guns. The Anshan's effectiveness in naval warfare was significantly enhanced with the torpedo tubes being replaced by anti-ship missile launchers. Although retired from the active service, the Anshan class destroyers remain on PLAN's list and act as training ships and perform public relations duties. The Luda class followed from the 1970s onwards, with many similarities to the Soviet Kotlin class. The Ludas are armed with six anti-ship missiles and various guns and ASW weapons. Both the Luda and Anshan were key vessels to PLAN's coastal defense doctrines, as small coastal defense destroyers. These ships were all armed with mostly manually operated air defense artillery with no surface-to-air missiles and no ASW torpedoes. One Luda class ship, 160, was lost in an accident. By the mid 1990s, all Anshan class destroyers were retired. The PLAN focus shifted in the 1980s. With the import of Western systems, and a focus on blue-water multi-role operations, the Luhu class emerged. The first vessel, Harbin (112) (seen and commissioned by the early 1990s), was a significant shift from traditional Chinese warship design. There was much more focus on air defense and ASW warfare, including the installation an 8-celled Crotale launcher, a short range missile system later indigenously produced as HQ-7. A second vessel, the Qingdao was launched later in the mid 1990s. Towards the end of the 1990s, the Luhai class was introduced as an enlarged version of the Luhu. These ships were the first truly modern combat vessels with blue water and multi-role operations in mind. These destroyers were still obsolete by Western standards, and delays in their construction resulted in just three being built. Since the late 1980s, the older Luda, and later the Luhu and Luhai classes have been through various upgrade and refit programmes. Both 112 and 113 of the Luhu class, and 167 of the Luhai class have undergone major refits. All three now carry sixteen YJ83 Anti-ship missiles, improved HQ-7 SAM (Based on the Crotale), and enhanced electronic, sensor and weaponry capabilities. Upgraded to the Luda class have been more sporadic. One vessel was refitted with a double hangar and helicopter deck. At least four others have been upgraded with HQ-7 short range SAM, new automatic air defense artillery (as opposed to the old manual mounts), torpedoes and sixteen YJ83 anti-ship missiles. Though the other remaining ships continue to retain original weaponry, they have all undergone major refits to extend their surface lives. All Ludas are being fitted with satellite communications and navigation systems to allow them to operate beyond coastal waters. In 1996, China signed a deal with Russia for the purchase of two Sovremenny class destroyers. The first ship arrived in January 2000 and the second in January 2001. These ships significantly improve the PLAN's fighting capabilities. Each ship displaces 7,940 tons full loaded. Weaponry included ASW torpedoes and mortar launchers, AK-630 automatic CIWS cannons, two twin mountings of 130 mm rapid fire cannons, the short-medium ranged SA-N-12 Grizzly Surface to Air Missile and the SS-N-22 Sunburn supersonic sea-skimming anti-ship missile. Two improved Sovremenny class vessels were acquired in 2002, and include a longer range SS-N-22 missile, improved air defense missiles, and the Kashtan CIWS cannon and missile combination. Since 2003, three new classes of indigenous destroyers have emerged. The Type 052B destroyer was the first, and features a stealthy design, modern layout, and adopted many Russian and indigenous weapons and sensors. Its armament included two indigenously designed Type 730 CIWS (first of its kind in China), sixteen YJ83 anti-ship missiles, two SA-N-12 Grizzly air defense missile launchers (48 missiles, 50 km range), torpedoes, anti-submarine rockets, a 100 mm artillery mount, and a hangar to hold one Kamov KA-28 ASW helicopter. This was followed by the Type 052C destroyer, which included 4 statically mounted phased array radars of indigenous design, providing the ship with continuous 360-degree coverage for search, tracking and direction for multiple SAM missiles. The Type 052C destroyer was the first PLAN warship to utilize a Vertical Launching System, with HQ-9 long range air defense missile (48 missiles, 200 km range, similar to the Russian S-300 missile). It is also armed with a new anti-ship cruise missile known as the YJ-62. The third class was the Type 051C destroyer. This class uses the same hull and layout as the Luhai class. Initial construction was delayed by the slow acquisition of the Russian S-300FM long range SAM. The ship uses VLS launchers with 48 rounds of the S-300FM. The S-300FM is capable of engaging low- to high-altitude targets as far as at least 150 km. The most recent class to be commissioned is the Type 052D destroyer that is a further development of the Type 052C destroyer, equipped with a new VLS system that includes 64 missiles of different variety. Currently the Type 055 destroyer, which is Asia's biggest warship (Aircraft carriers and Amphibious assault ship not included) since the Second World War, is under construction and development. A total of 8 vessels are planned. The Type 055 destroyer is China's biggest surface combatant until now. It is designed to be a modern, multi-purpose warship, with four enormous Type 346B AESA radars and an integrated mast containing intelligence equipment, electronic countermeasures, and fire control radars. Armament will include 112-cell modular VLS able to operate with a variety of missiles, including land-attack cruise missiles, and a new 130 mm naval gun. Its displacement in excess of 10,000 tons and upgraded VLS capacity has led to the United States classifying it as a guided missile cruiser rather than a destroyer and as a result, analysts have compared it to the U.S Navy's Ticonderoga class cruiser and the Zumwalt class destroyer. Frigates Type 054A frigate (Jiangkai II-class) Frigates are the most numerous principal surface combatants in the People's Liberation Army Navy. In spite of the more recent trend to construction of larger warships, like destroyers, this status is unlikely to change in the near future: * Type 054A frigate (NATO designation Jiangkai II-class)  30 in active service, * Type 054 frigate (NATO designation Jiangkai I-class)  2 in active service * Type 053H3 frigate (NATO designation Jiangwei II-class)  8 in active service. * Type 053 frigate (NATO designation Jianghu-class)  9 in active service. =Development= Frigates were the first large surface combatants made available to the PLAN. The Soviet Union sold several frigates to the PLAN in the 1950s, including the Riga-class frigates. These frigates became the foundation of Chinese built designs, such as the Type 053 frigates. These ships were mostly armed with naval guns, though later designs managed to replace torpedo tubes with a twin launcher for SS-N-2 Styx anti-ship missiles. Initial attempts to fit anti-aircraft missiles to frigates resulted in a single ship known as the Jiangdong. The ship was completed in 1970 carrying two twin launchers for the HQ-61B short ranged SAM, this vessel served as the sole PLAN SAM capable frigate until the 1990s. Its effectiveness in engaging missiles and aircraft was thought to be limited. The same hull was later used for the Jianghu class (Type 053H) class. During the 1970s the PLAN introduced the Jianghu class. Essentially, a scaled down version of the Luda class of destroyers, this large class of missile frigates would have many follow-on variants. The first hull, 515 Xiamen was completed in 1975, and mass production followed until 1996. All Jianghu class ships are armed with four SY-2 anti-ship missiles (indigenous and improved versions of initial Soviet SS-N-2 Styx). Gun armaments vary across the class, including a single 100 mm mount or a more modern Type 79 100 mm twin mounts. The latest eight hulls (built during the early 1990s) feature automatic twin 37 mm Type 76A AA guns. One Jianghu, hull 516, was refitted recently to carry a battery of 122 mm rockets, fixed on stabilized launchers. A total of 27 Jianghu Is were built, and they remain in use today with various upgrades and refits to extend their service life. The vessels are deficient in modern anti-aircraft, anti-ship and anti-submarine fighting capabilities. The first Chinese frigate to carry a helicopter was a modified Jianghu II, the Siping 544, dubbed as the Jianghu IV class. Only one ship was modified, despite great optimism that most of the class would follow suit. The Siping is believed to perform more as a test ship, with a single helicopter hangar and a new single 100 mm gun mount similar to the French Creusot-Loire rapid fire main gun. Its fighting capabilities have been retained with twin SY-2 missiles and AA guns. The fitting of the helicopter hangar meant the sacrifice of the aft SY-2 missile launchers. A further step for the Jianghu class was made by the appearance of the Jianghu III/V class, first commissioned in 1986. These ships are the first to have air conditioning onboard Chinese warships. They feature heavy Western influence, and instead of using the SY-2 missiles, they are armed with the YJ8 series. The Jianghu V class carries the YJ82 with extended range. There are three ships in the Jianghu III class and six ships in Jianghu V class. The Jiangwei I class was launched in 1991 and represented a shift away from the old Jianghu concept. Major features included a sextuple HQ-61B SAM launcher, modernized electronics and radar, six YJ8 missiles, automatic Type 76F anti- aircraft guns and a hangar and helicopter deck for one French AS 565 or Z-9C helicopter. Four of the Jiangwei I were built between 1990 and 1994. Though a great versatile design, it suffered the same weaknesses in air defense, as its SAM had to be manually reloaded as well as unsatisfactory performance. The four ships have been refitted since for life extension, and continue to serve the PLAN. The HQ-61 SAM system was later replaced by HQ-7 SAM systems during refits. The first Jiangwei II was launched in 1997. This has a similar design layout to the Jiangwei I but has incorporated major improvements. These included eight (not six) YJ82/3 missiles, octuple HQ-7 SAM (replacing the HQ-61B), improved fully automated main gun, and a redesigned aft structure. Ten Jiangwei IIs have been built, the last ship commissioned in 2005. All Jiangweis have since been refitted with a stealthier gun casing for their 100 mm main guns. In 2005, The Jiangkai I Type 054 frigate entered PLAN service (hulls 525 and 526). The Type 054 is considerably stealthier than all previous PLAN frigate designs. The Type 054 Ma'anshan class is armed with an HQ-7 octuple launcher, eight YJ83 anti-ship missiles, a 100 mm main gun, four AK630 CIWS turrets, ASW torpedoes and rocket launchers, carries one Ka-28 Helix or Z-9C, and displaces 3,400 tons. This represents a new generation of frigate design in the PLAN, and a shifting focus on larger multi-role platforms. The air defense missile armament is no better than the Jiangwei II class although this may be upgraded later. The Type 054 has now been superseded by the Jiangkai II Type 054A frigate, which is in series production. The 054A features a number of important improvements over the original 054. The main air defense armament has been upgraded to a 32-cell VLS HQ-16 medium-range SAM system, giving area air-defence capability for the first time to PLAN frigates. In addition, the four AK630 CIWS have been replaced by two autonomous Type 730 CIWS. The Type 054A is altogether a well balanced and stealthy frigate design, with considerable firepower and multi-role versatility. Corvettes Type 056 corvette (Jiangdao-class) Corvettes are the smallest principal surface combatants in the People's Liberation Army Navy. Traditionally the PLAN operated extensive fleets of missile and gun boats for defence of its littoral waters. However, as the PLAN moved towards developing blue water capabilities, there is a growing need to replace a larger number of smaller vessels with a smaller number of larger and much more capable vessels: * Type 056 corvette (NATO designation Jiangdao-class)  44 in active service. more on sea trials. At least 70 planned. =Development= Following the designing and building of the Pattani class corvette for the Royal Thai Navy in the mid-2000s, speculation of a domestic variant of the design was rife. The speculations were confirmed in November 2010 during a visit by Maj. Gen. Wang Junli, Deputy commander of the Hong Kong Garrison and the Hong Kong University's Vice-Chancellor Tsui Lap-chee when a model of the Type 056 was presented. The first ship was launched in May 2012. Though the Type 056 appears in the 21st century, the design concept can be referred to as early as the 1980s, when the PLAN were considering developing a larger patrol ship to replace the Type 037 to improve the living conditions on the ship, which was firstly called by Type 038. However, this concept was not realized until the appearance of Type 056 in 2012 due to the shortage of funds.201304 Ëà∞ËàπÁü•ËØÜ,Êµ∑ÂÜõÂéüÂâØÂè∏‰ª§Âëò„ÄÅË£ÖÂ§áÈÉ®ÈÉ®ÈïøÈáëÁüõËÆ≤Ëø∞Êµ∑ÂÜõË£ÖÂ§áÂèëÂ±ïÂéÜÁ®ã‰∏≠ÁöÑ‰∏Ä‰∫õÈáçË¶ÅÁöÑÁâáÊÆµ The Type 056 has a stealthy hull design with sloped surface and a reduced superstructure clutter. There is a helipad at the stern for a light helicopter but has no organic helicopter support facilities. The main anti-ship armament consists of YJ-83 sea-skimming anti-ship cruise missiles in two twin-cell launchers. The primary anti- aircraft armament is one FL-3000N short range missile system with 8 rounds. A 76 mm main gun based on a Russian AK-176 is mounted forward. 2 triple torpedo tubes are mounted for ASW operations. Type 056 is the first Chinese warship with modular design, which makes it cover the roles from OPV to multi-role frigate. The PLAN used versions may include patrol type, ASW type, ASuW type, AAW type and commander type; while the export versions can be quite differently fitted according to consumer's requirement. For the moment, at least 3 variants of Type 056 for export exist with the same design of hull but varying bridge designs and armament layouts. A total of 20 corvettes are initially planned, but it is expected that anywhere up-to 60 corvettes could be eventually brought into active service. Missile boats, submarine chasers and gunboats Type 22 missile boat With increasing acquisition of destroyers, submarines, frigates and auxiliary support assets, missile and gun boats mostly disappeared from the PLAN fleet, with numbers reduced dramatically. However new classes of missile attack boats continue to be built to replace older types: * Type 22 missile boat (NATO designation Houbei-class)  83 in active service. * Type 037II missile boat (NATO designation Houjian-class)  6 in active service. * Type 037IG missile boat (NATO designation Houxin-class)  20 in active service. * Type 037I submarine chaser (NATO designation Haiqing-class)  27 in active service. * Type 037 submarine chaser (NATO designation Hainan-class)  67 in active service. * Type 062I gunboat (NATO designation Shanghai III-class)  17 in active service. =Development= The PLAN's main focus until the 1980s was a sharp emphasis on coastal defense and littoral warfare. This was influenced from early engagements where the Communist forces found the value of small maneuverable craft against larger, better armed but slower Nationalist ships. Early littoral craft in the PLAN's inventory included riverine craft and gun boats converted from various ships. This was later added to in the 1950s by Soviet-designed gun and torpedo attack craft. Such gun craft included the Kronstadt class heavily armed gun boats which served the PLAN until the 1980s. Soviet missile attack craft were later added to the fleet, including the Komar and Osa type fast attack missile craft. Although most littoral designs bore Soviet influence, there were quite a few indigenous designs or copies of Soviet-type craft. Hundreds of vessels were deployed by the fleet, serving as the backbone of the PLAN until a higher emphasis was placed upon bluewater naval operations. Despite availability of frigates and destroyers, the brunt of PLAN involvement in small-scale conflicts have been borne by the littoral forces. For instance, the various naval engagements between Chinese and Vietnamese naval forces were carried out by PLAN littoral craft. Today missile boats compose of the Houjian, Houxin and Houbei classes. The 478-ton Houxin design is based on the Hainan-class hull, but with a redesigned superstructure, new systems, two automatic twin-37 mm guns and four YJ8 series anti-ship missiles. Around 28 are in service, built since the 1990s. A much more sophisticated and stealthy design is the 520-ton Houjian class. Main armament of the Houjian design is the twin 37 mm mount, two 30 mm twin turrets, and six YJ8 series anti-ship missiles. The Houjian is far more capable, larger and more flexible than the Houxin, being based primarily in Hong Kong. The total number produced is not certain, but six craft are in service. The latest generation missile attack craft is the 220X (Houbei) design. Seen since 2005, its most distinctive feature is its trimaran hull that can achieve maximum wave piercing performance at high speeds. The stealthy design has two missile-houses, that can possibly be fitted with various ordnance. Eight missiles of the YJ83 anti-ship missiles are believed to be carried, as well as a single AK630 CIWS for self-defense. Four hulls emerged by 2005, with another eight to twelve others being constructed as of 2006. Submarine chasers are plentiful in the PLAN and serve to screen China's territorial waters against submarine incursions. The Hainan class has proven itself to be a reliable design in many roles. Its main armament is two twin 57 mm guns, and two 25 mm AAA. The Hainan is also armed with anti-submarine multi-barrelled rockets and depth charges. There is provision for the fitment of four YJ8 series anti-ship missiles as well. The Haiqing class is a second generation improvement over the Hainan, with redesigned superstructure, automatic 37 mm AA guns and newer generation sonars and ASW equipment.  Mine countermeasures  The People's Liberation Army Navy operates three mine countermeasure classes and a single mine layer class: * Type 081 mine countermeasure vessel (NATO designation Wochi-class)  10 in active service. * Type 082II mine countermeasure vessel (NATO designation Wozang-class)  2 in active service. * Type 082 mine countermeasure vessel (NATO designation Wosao-class)  17 in active service. = Development = Despite the extensive use of mines as a strategically important defensive and offensive weapon, the PLAN operates only a small number of mine warfare ships. These boats comprised mine-laying and mine-sweeping types. The PLAN operates a single Wolei class mine-layer. This ship was commissioned in 1988 and displaces 2,300 tons full load. It can carry and lay up to 300 mines. There is little need of a dedicated mine-laying type however, as most PLA surface and submarine combatants can lay minefields. Minesweepers have served the PLAN since its founding. Currently two new classes of minesweeper have emerged since the late 1980s (Type 082 and Type 082II) and a single class since the 2000s (Type 081). Coastal minesweeping is primarily conducted by the Type 082 class. Blue-water minesweeping is fulfilled by the Type 082II and Type 081 classes.  Fleet replenishment  Type 905 replenishment ship (Fuqing-class) Fleet replenishment has been an expanding element in PLAN auxiliaries. The PLAN view the need of replenishment ships as vital for blue water fleet operations: * Type 901 fast combat support ship (NATO designation Fuyu-class)  2 in active service * Type 903 replenishment ship (NATO designation Fuchi- class)  8 in active service. * Type 904 general stores issue ship (NATO designation Dayun-class)  6 in active service. * Type 908 replenishment ship (NATO designation Fusu-class)  1 in active service. * Type 905 replenishment ship (NATO designation Fuqing-class)  2 withdrawn from service. = Development = Since the 1970s, underway replenishment has been widely practiced by destroyer and frigate combatants. In many overseas visits, a tanker has traditionally accompanied the visiting ship. The first replenishment ships built for the dedicated task of fleet refueling were the Fuqing-class replenishment ship, of which two remain in service. The next fleet replenishment vessel was purchased from Russia in the 1990s, being the single Nancang (Fusu-class). This ship is significantly superior to the Fuqing-class in terms of refueling systems and the storage capacity. Two new hulls of the indigenous Fuchi-class were commissioned into service by 2005. With five ships (and possibly a sixth vessel), the PLAN's ability to operate further away from home has been significantly enhanced. The demands of modern- day warfare has meant that logistic support ships in the navy are becoming vital.  Auxiliaries  The PLAN operates a very large number and variety of auxiliary vessels that are capable of supporting fleet and military operations both in a coastal and ocean theatres of war. PLAN auxiliary vessels are present in all three fleets, stationed in many naval bases and have increasingly exercised frequently alongside combatants. PLAN auxiliaries include tugboats, freighters, submarine tenders, research, survey ships, missile and satellite monitoring platforms, ice breakers, repair and communications, electronic warfare and monitoring, transport and training ships. The following is a list of auxiliaries thought to be in service with the PLAN as of 2014‚Äì2015. However no list can be entirely accurate and may contain significant inaccuracies. ; Hospital ships * 1 Type 920 hospital ship (NATO designation Anwei-class) * 1 Chinese medical evacuation ship Zhuanghe (NATO designation unknown) * 1 Qiongsha-class ambulance transport (NATO designation Qiongsha-class) ; Icebreakers * 2 Type 272 icebreaker (NATO designation Yanrao-class) * 1 Type 210 icebreaker (NATO designation Yanbing- class) * 3 Type 071 icebreaker (NATO designation Yanha-class) ; Barracks ship * 1 Chinese barracks ship Xu Xiake (NATO designation Daguan-class) ; Troop transport/ferry & cargo * 5 Qiongsha-class cargo ship (NATO designation Qiongsha-class) * 1 Beidiao 990 ;Training ships Type 679 training ship (Daxing-class) * 1 Type 680 training ship (NATO designation Dadu-class) * 1 Type 679 training ship (NATO designation Daxin-class) * 1 Type 0891A training ship (NATO designation Dashi-class) ;Cargo transport * 3 Yantai-class (NATO designation Yantai-class) * 5 Type 081 cargo ship (NATO designation Hongqi- class) * 13 Danlin-class cargo ship (NATO designation Danlin-class) * 4 Dandao-class (NATO designation Dandao-class) * 2 Gala»õi-class cargo ship (NATO designation Gala»õi-class) ; Coastal oil tankers * 9 Leizhou-class tanker (NATO designation Leizhou-class) * 8 Fulin-class oil tanker (NATO designation Fulin- class) * 2 Shengli-class oil tanker (NATO designation Shengli-class) * 7 Fuzhou-class tanker (NATO designation Fuzhou-class) * 3 Jinyou-class oil tanker (NATO designation Jinyou-class) ; Ballistic missile tracking Yuan Wang- class ballistic missile tracking ship * 6 Yuan Wang-class tracking ship (NATO designation Yuanwang-class) ; Intelligence gathering Type 815 spy ship (Dondiao-class) * 1 Type 813 spy ship (NATO designation unknown) * 1 Type 814A spy ship (NATO designation Dadie-class) * 6 Type 815 spy ship (NATO designation Dondiao-class) ; Oceanographic surveillance ships * 2 Type 595 ocean surveillance ship (NATO designation unknown) * 1 Type 639 oceanographic surveillance ship (NATO designation unknown) * 3 Type 927 acoustic surveillance ships ; Oceanographic research, meteorological and hydrographic survey ships * 1 Chinese oceanographic research ship Xiangyanghong 5 (NATO designation unknown) * 1 Type 645 oceanographic research ship (NATO designation unknown) * 8 Type 625 research vessel (NATO designation unknown) * 5 Type 614 research vessel (NATO designation unknown) * 5 Type 635 hydrographic survey ship (NATO designation Yanlai-class) * 6 Type 636 hydrographic survey ship (NATO designation unknown) * 1 Type 988 hydrographic survey ship (NATO designation unknown) ; Submarine support Type 925 submarine support ship (Dajiang-class) * 1 Type 930 submarine rescue ship (NATO designation Hudong-class) * 3 Type 946 submarine rescue ship (NATO designation Dazhou, Dadong-class) * 3 Type 925 submarine support ship (NATO designation Dajiang-class) * 3 Type 926 submarine support ship (NATO designation Dalao- class) * 1 Type 648 repair ship (NATO designation unknown) ; Torpedo trials/retriever * 1 Type 906 torpedo trials craft (NATO designation unknown) * 1 Type 907A torpedo trials craft (NATO designation unknown) * 7 Type 917 torpedo retriever (NATO designation unknown) ; Weapons trials * 3 Type 909 weapon trials ship (NATO designation Wuhu-B-class) ; Sonar trials * 1 Chinese sonar trials ship Beidiao 993 (NATO designation Beidiao-class) ; Experimental ships * Chinese target ship Experiment 216 (NATO designation unknown) ; Rescue and salvage * 6 Type 922 rescue and salvage ship (NATO designation Dalang- class) * 2 Type 917 rescue and salvage ship (NATO designation unknown) ; Dive tender * 2 Type 904 dive tender (NATO designation unknown) ; Tug boats * 4 Tuozhong-class (NATO designation Tuozhong-class) * 1 Daozha-class (NATO designation Tuozhong-class) * 15 Type 802 tug (NATO designation Gromovoy- class) * 3 Type 830 tug (NATO designation unknown) * 18 Type 837 tug (NATO designation Hujiu-class) * 19 Type 852 tug (NATO designation Roslavl-class) ; Degaussing & deperming * 2 Type 911 degaussing/deperming ship (NATO designation unknown) * 8 Type 912 degaussing/deperming ship (NATO designation unknown) ; Cable laying * 1 Type 890 cable layer (NATO designation Youzheng- class) * 7 Type 991 cablelayer (NATO designation Youdian-class) ; Buoy tenders * 6 Type 744 buoy tender (NATO designation Yannan-class) * 1 Type 999 buoy tender (NATO designation unknown) Nomenclature Ships of PLAN are named per Naval Vessels Naming Regulation (‰∏≠ÂõΩÊµ∑ÂÜõËà∞ËâáÂëΩÂêçÊù°‰æã) that was first issued by the Central Military Commission (CMC) on 3 November 1978, and subsequently revised 7 July 1986.

Her personality gave this teen celebrity magazine its stamp for many years. Stavers is credited with being one of the first women rock-and-roll journalists, but male editors, detractors and those who scoffed at teen or celebrity magazines sometimes called her \\"Mother Superior of the Inferior\\". Early years Very little is known of Stavers' childhood and adolescence. She was born Gloria Gurganus in Wilmington, North Carolina. She had married and divorced young, and moved to New York to pursue a modeling career. For a time she was involved socially with the \\"jet set\\" and was rumored to be involved romantically with baseball player Mickey Mantle. Health issues forced Stavers to give up modeling. Stavers got her start at 16 Magazine in 1957 as a subscriptions clerk. She was initially paid 50 cents an hour. Stavers developed many of her ideas about how the magazine should be run by reading the fan letters from preteenaged girls writing to various celebrities in care of the magazine. As she read those letters, she remembered how she felt as a preteenager and what she most cared about at that age.Moser, Margaret. \\"The Singer Not the Song,\\" Weekly Wire (June 14, 1999). Stavers had no prior experience in journalism nor did she possess a university degree, but she rose quickly through the ranks. She was promoted to the position of editor in chief, wherein she had unprecedented access to many of the top recording acts of the day. Although 16 Magazine had a staff of reporters on both coasts, Stavers wrote most of the magazine's feature articles herself. She also served as the magazine's chief photographer and shot numerous photographs of stars such as Paul Revere and the Raiders, Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits, The Rascals, and Jim Morrison, lead singer of The Doors. Editorial style Stavers was known for being singleminded regarding the image of \\"her\\" magazine. Her main priority was giving her teenage female reader base what it wanted, and what they wanted, according to Stavers, was the feeling of being \\"close\\" to their favorite stars. Stavers would receive more than 300 letters per day addressed to her from teenagers. She read every letter and took their words to heart, and then tried to use the magazine to address the concerns that were often written off as \\"silly\\" by adults. As an editor, she eschewed serious or controversial subject matter for 16 Magazine interviews. Rather than asking a celebrity about social issues, she preferred to discuss more personal and lightly intimate topics such a celebrity's favorite color or meal or to ask him who his idea of whom a \\"dream date\\" would be. Her style of interviewing was referred to as the \\"Forty Intimate Questions.\\" Her first interview using that format was with the Canadian pop singer Paul Anka. Stavers, in her writings, attempted to make the celebrity appear approachable and \\"attainable\\" for her young readers. In short, the celebrity was a \\"surrogate boyfriend\\" for the reader. If the artist was married, in a long term relationship or was not heterosexual in orientation, that fact was never mentioned in the magazine. In her editorial content, Stavers seldom if ever wrote critical or unflattering prose regarding any celebrity. She preferred to focus on the positive qualities of the \\"faves.\\" She ignored those celebrities and musical acts whom she felt would not capture her readers' interest, or those who failed to capture her personal interest. If the \\"fave\\" appeared to have fallen out of favor, then Stavers merely stopped covering that celebrity in the magazine, and would find someone else to feature. Despite frequently using a teenzine shorthand for some words such as \\"fave\\" for favorite, and \\"cuz\\" for the word because, Stavers was a stickler for correct spelling and grammar. Influence According to a feature article in the Saturday Evening Post in 1967, record companies frequently consulted Stavers as to how to best promote an artist, and would not make a decision until she weighed in with her opinion. At that time, few women in any field wielded such power. Tony Barrow, the press officer to The Beatles, credits Stavers with providing \\"significant help\\" toward the task of fast-tracking the band to the top of the U.S. charts. In the months before their first visit to the US, a substantial volume of the editorial space in 16 was given to The Beatles. Paul McCartney remembered Gloria as being \\"very dignified, very professional and totally business-like. She inspired respect from us all\\". In the 1980 movie The Idolmaker, there is an unflattering portrayal of a mercurial \\"prima donna\\" teen magazine editor, based loosely on Stavers. The role of Ellen Fields was played by Maureen McCormick of The Brady Bunch. According to some of Stavers's contemporaries, she tended to run roughshod over underlings, and she was known for her use of strong profanities and issuing ultimatums. However, Stavers was known to threaten some of the \\"faves\\" if she didn't get what she wanted from them. In one instance, Stavers allegedly threatened to print the full real name of Paul Revere if he didn't agree to make an appearance at a hospital to visit a dying girl. Revere's full name was Paul Revere Dick. Despite her many detractors, Stavers had an admirer and defender in American Bandstand host Dick Clark. He said of Stavers, \\"She had her finger on the pulse of what kids were thinking, which impressed me. We both, as adults, could \\"think young\\" and see what was interesting and ascertain what the future would bring in the next few months. Gloria helped American Bandstand, and the show helped 16. It was a two-way street.\\" Many in the entertainment and publishing industries believed that Stavers and Clark shared the power to \\"make or break\\" a teen idol. At times, Stavers appeared to push people to the forefront who seemed to be unlikely candidates for teen idol status, such as comedian Lenny Bruce, Dark Shadows actor Jonathan Frid, Star Trek actor Leonard Nimoy, and shock rock pioneer Alice Cooper. Stavers also began to experiment with new publishing and photography trends which she incorporated into the magazine. However, not everyone agreed with Stavers on the right direction for the magazine. According to a 1999 autobiography written by former teen idol Donny Osmond, Stavers and his mother Olive Osmond had a continual disagreement regarding the use of increasingly sexualized pin-up pictures featuring her sons and other teen idols. Stavers was rumored to have become romantically or sexually involved with several of the celebrities she interviewed. Stavers had dated 1950s teen idol Dion DiMucci, and during the 1960s, she was also one of Jim Morrison's long-term lovers. John Prine, an American country/folk singer- songwriter, dedicated Great Days, an anthology of his work released in 1993, to Gloria Stavers. Later years By the mid-1960s and throughout the early 1970s, Stavers was encountering fierce competition from other teen magazines such as Tiger Beat. She also had competition from other journalists now focusing their attentions on the rock music scene such as Patricia Kennealy and Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone. In 1975, Stavers left 16 Magazine after a publishing dispute. After her departure from the magazine, Stavers worked as a freelance writer and photographer, and she gathered information and outlined a biography about Jim Morrison. She also spent time learning about spirituality, particularly Buddhism. On April 1, 1983, Stavers died of lung cancer at NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian Hospital. She was 55 years old at the time of her death. She was a long term smoker. Stavers' obituary was printed in Rolling Stone magazine, one of 16 Magazine's primary competitors.

It was formed by Dorset Carter of Purcell, Indian Territory,Cammalleri, Joseph A. \\"Selections From Meade's Manual Oklahoma Central\\", http://www.atsfry.com/easternarchive/meades/okcentrl.htm and other business interests in 1904 as the Canadian Valley and Western Railway. On August 19, 1905 the name was changed to Oklahoma Central Railway. Construction was started in Lehigh, Oklahoma, in 1906 and was completed to Chickasha, Oklahoma, in 1908. The route was primarily constructed to transport coal from the mines at Lehigh to Purcell in order to service steam locomotives on the Santa Fe, which maintained a division point at that location. The OCR trackage consisted of from Lehigh to Chickasha that included the stations of Lehigh, Ada, Vanoss, Stratford, Byars, Rosedale, Purcell, Washington, Cole, Blanchard, Middelberg, Tabler, and Chickasha. In addition, a branch extended from a point west of Lehigh into additional coal mines in Coal County. The primary sources of revenue included transport of passengers and express, coal, cotton and cotton by-products, livestock, and building materials. After 1908 trains were operated as mixed trains. History Financing for the OCR was largely provided by investors on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, through a bond issue backed by veteran financial writer Frederik Van Oss. Carter, who was a prominent lawyer, banker, and developer in Purcell, I.T., approached Van Oss through a group of Chicago banking acquaintances and secured an initial issue of $852,000. Construction of the line began in late 1905 at Lehigh by the Canadian Valley Construction Company, which was also owned by Carter unbeknownst to the Dutch financiers. Preliminary cost estimates were quickly shown to be inadequate due to unexpected quantities of hard rock to be removed. The line was constructed with a maximum gradient of 2% and to Class I standards, despite being a short line. Suspecting that a finance scam may have been underfoot, Van Oss sent a representative, Gerrit Middelberg, to Purcell to monitor the construction of the road and operations of the company. Middelberg's colorful letters belie a distaste for the living conditions and cuisine of the frontier, and a deep suspicion of Mr. Carter. In one letter he declares, \\"it is now apparent that the forces behind the railway and the construction company are one and the same.\\" Van Oss refused to send additional funds, and construction crews camped a few miles west of Blanchard while waiting for additional rails to arrive. The community that developed from this camp was named Middelberg, in an apparent attempt to curry favor with the hard-lined Dutch overseer. In addition to the dummy construction company that was \\"building\\" the line, the OCR also involved itself in forced real estate developments. Rather than constructing its road through existing townships, the OCR routed two or three miles (5 km) away from the community. Management would then negotiate with local farmers to purchase land (using bond notes supplied by the Dutch) and then plat a new town around the railroad. The communities were given the option of purchasing the new lots (for cash) or attempting to survive without rail service. This practice was well documented by the Chickasaw News in 1906, a newspaper from McGee, I.T., which was relocated by this process three miles (5 km) to south and is now called Stratford. This also may have occurred at Blanchard and Stonewall. The OCR went into receivership in June 1908 and Asa E. Ramsey was appointed as receiver. Trains were reduced to mixed service (passenger and freight on the same train), and cost-cutting measures were introduced. Unfortunately, the coal-burning steam locomotives of the Santa Fe had primarily switched to fuel oil, and the coal traffic from Lehigh became less profitable. A coal miner's strike in 1911 ended the mines and the OCR lost a major component of its revenue stream. On May 27, 1914, the Santa Fe obtained a five-year lease agreement with a $2,000,000 purchase option.\\"Santa Fe Gets Oklahoma Road,\\" The New York Times, Page 10, May 28, 1914 Unable to meet its mounting construction debt, the line was sold to the Santa Fe in 1917 for 25 cents on each $1000 bond note, and was merged into the Santa Fe in 1942. Tracks from Lehigh to Ada and Purcell to Byars were removed in 1934, and Purcell-Chickasha in 1941.Veenendaal, Jr., Augustus J.

Chickasha to Cole trackage was removed in 1956, and Cole to Purcell was abandoned in 1964. Spotting features and survivors ;Lehigh The mainline of the OCR is on the west side of highway 75 as it enters town. At the south edge of town, a wye curved to the east to service mine No. 8. The tracks curved west sharply at the north edge of town and passed between two mine pits on a narrow patch of unexcavated ground. ;Ada Ada was reached by a long spur that left the mainline near the present location of the US-177 junction. The depot at Ada still stands on the west end of town. ;Stratford The Stratford depot is still standing on S. Hyden and is used as the city hall. ;Byars From the south end of Byars Cemetery a large wooden trestle over a creek is still intact. The line passed directly behind the cemetery and curves to the north about 1 block west of it. North of town, the great earthworks that carried the OCR main line over the Santa Fe are still visible, including some cut off trestle pilings. ;Purcell Buried in the woods behind a large metal industrial building are the remains of the bridge approaches over Walnut Creek. This wooden bridge was washed out by a flood at an unknown date. The only stretch of surviving OCR main line is in place across the street to the north of this, a single switch and hundred feet or so of track. The switch was the interchange wye with the Santa Fe's Purcell yards; after 1934 this was the only way OCR trackage was accessed to the West. As of 2015, this too has been removed and only the ties remain overgrown by trees. ;Blanchard The original depot was located between 13th and 14th on Main Street (present day 5th and 6th street and main) according to the Sanborn Map Company Feb, 1926. There are no remnants of the depot today. ;Chickasha The excellent two story brick depot and offices are intact and presently being used by the Chickasha newspaper on the north side of town. The OCR crossed the present-day UP and BNSF diamonds at an angle from the southeast and backed into the station.

Following the war, the ship was transferred to the Department of Marine and Fisheries for use as a fisheries patrol vessel on the west coast. Givenchy reentered service with the RCN in 1939 as an accommodation ship during the Second World War and was recommissioned from 1940 to 1943. After the war the ship was sold and broken up in the United States in 1952. Design and description The RCN's Battle-class trawlers formed part of the Canadian naval response to Admiralty warnings to Canada about the growing German U-boat threat to merchant shipping in the western Atlantic.Tucker, p. 253 Intended to augment anti-submarine patrols off Canada's east coast, these ships were modelled on contemporary British North Sea trawlers, since the standard types of Canadian fishing vessels were considered unsuitable for patrol work.Tucker, pp. 254, 257 Twelve vessels were ordered on 2 February 1917 from two shipyards, Polson Iron Works of Toronto and Canadian Vickers of Montreal.Johnston et al., p. 417 Those vessels built at Canadian Vickers displaced and were long overall with a beam of and a draught of .Macpherson and Barrie, p. 27 The vessels were propelled by a steam-powered triple expansion engine driving one shaft creating giving the vessels a maximum speed of .Maginley and Collin, p. 67 All twelve trawlers were equipped with a QF 12-pounder 12 cwt naval gun mounted forward. This was considered to be the smallest gun that stood a chance of putting a surfaced U-boat out of action, and they also carried a small number of depth charges.Tucker, p. 257 The trawlers were named after battles of the Western Front during the First World War that Canadians had been involved in. They cost between $155,000 and $160,000 per vessel. Service history Named for the Battle of Givenchy, the ship was constructed by Canadian Vickers at Montreal and launched on 15 September 1917.Macpherson and Barrie, p. 28 Intended for use during the 1917 shipping season, the construction of the vessels was delayed by the entry of the United States into the war. With higher wages found south of the border, a shortage of skilled labour developed in the shipyards, coupled with a shortage of construction material.Johnston et al., pp. 481‚Äì484 The six vessels ordered from Canadian Vickers were delayed further by difficulty in providing engines for the trawlers. The hulls had been finished during Summer 1917. However, the engines did not arrive until the fall.Johnston et al., p. 484 The ship was commissioned on 22 June 1918. Givenchy sailed to the east coast where for the 1918 shipping season, all the Battle-class trawlers were assigned to patrol and escort duties based out of Sydney, Nova Scotia.Johnston et al., pp. 543, 645 The vessel performed these duties until the end of the war. Along with , and , Givenchy accompanied on a trip to the west coast via the Panama Canal in early 1919. The trawler was paid off by the RCN on 12 August 1919 at Esquimalt, British Columbia. The vessel was one of nine of the class to transfer to the Department of Marine and Fisheries, where Givenchy became a fisheries patrol vessel.Maginley and Collin, pp. 91, 113 After the outbreak of the Second World War, Givenchy returned to RCN service on 15 April 1939 and was used as an accommodation ship for the Fisherman's Reserve on the west coast. The ship recommissioned into the RCN from 25 June 1940 to 18 April 1943. Following the end of the war, the ship was sold to private interests on 19 September 1946 and was sold for scrap on 22 September 1952 to be broken up in the United States.Colledge, p. 261 References =Notes= =Citations= =Sources=  * External links * Battle-class trawlers Trawlers of the Royal Canadian Navy Battle-class trawlers World War I naval ships of Canada 1917 ships Auxiliary ships of the Royal Canadian Navy Ships of the Royal Canadian Navy ","title":"HMCS Givenchy"},{"id":"5751379","text":"Coat of Arms of Terra di Lavoro Terra di Lavoro (Liburia in Latin) is the name of a historical region of Southern Italy. It corresponds roughly to the modern southern Lazio and northern Campania and upper north west and west border area of Molise regions of Italy. In Italian the name means literally \\"Land of Work\\", but in fact derives from the ancient Liburia, a territory north of Aversa which took its name from the ancient Italic tribe of the Leborini. History The Terra di Lavoro was originally a giustizierato (justiciarship) and then a province of the Kingdom of Sicily, later Kingdom of Naples. After the Congress of Vienna (1815) it became a department of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, and, after the unification of Italy (1860s), a province of the Regno d'Italia. The capital was Capua until 1818 and then Caserta. In the pre- Republican Italy, the Terra di Lavoro was one of the largest provinces: it comprised the current province of Caserta, the southern part of today's provinces of Latina and Frosinone, the countryside of Nola of the province of Naples, and the Sannio (provinces of Benevento, Campobasso and Isernia). The main cities in the province were Capua, Caserta, Sessa Aurunca, Formia, Gaeta, Isola del Liri, Itri, Nola, Acerra, Sora, Aquino, Arpino and Roccasecca. The Pontine Islands were also part of the province. Terra di Lavoro in an old city plate of center In 1863 the upper valley of the Volturno was separated to form the new province of Campobasso, while the communes in the Valle Caudina became part of the provinces of Benevento and Avellino. In 1927 the province of Frosinone was established and the Terra di Lavoro was abolished, probably by personal order by Benito Mussolini.

It comprises Ghent, West Ghent, and Ghent Square. Other portions of surrounding neighborhoods are often attributed to Ghent as an extension of its commerce including Chelsea, North Colley Avenue, and active gentrification into portions of Park Place to the north, labelled 'The Railroad District'. Ghent's boundaries to the south are Mowbray Arch/Brambleton Avenue along The Hague and the Neon District, the Elizabeth River to the west, Monticello Avenue on the east, and the railroad crossing at 22nd Street to the North. History A commonly referenced story claims that around 1810 a man named J. Moran became the owner of a swath of land along the Elizabeth River. By some accounts, Mr. Moran became inspired by the conclusion of the War of 1812 and James Madison's ratification of the Treaty of Ghent that ended the conflict, and decided to name his estate \\"Ghent\\" in honor of the peace treaty. Another widely accepted story claims that in the 1830s a Norfolk resident, Commodore Richard Drummond, purchased the farmland south of the city from Mr. Moran, however, it was not yet named. Drummond purportedly owned the ship on which the Treaty of Ghent was transported back to America. Proud of this honor, Drummond is said to have built his new home on the land he had purchased and named it \\"Ghent\\" to commemorate the occasion. The first of the homes to make up the neighborhood were built along this portion of the river known as Smith's Creek. The street \\"Drummond Place\\" in Ghent bears his name. Two Dutchmen are responsible for transforming that farmland into the streets of Ghent we have today. J. P. Andre Mottu immigrated to America from The Netherlands in 1890. He worked for the Norfolk Company, partially owned by Adolphe Boissevain, a visionary and investor in American railroads and real estate. At this time the land on which Drummond built his home was connected to Norfolk only by a single pedestrian bridge. Mottu and Boissevain, attracted by the waterfront, envisioned the area modeled after their home in The Netherlands, and so renamed Smith's Creek after The Hague in South Holland, as for the neighborhood, the name Ghent would stick. Marshlands in this area were filled and the shoreline given a semicircular shape to mimic the canals of their Dutch homeland. Mottu and Boissevain's plan for Ghent successfully exploited the area's strategic waterfront location, providing views over the creek to the grass banks on the opposite shore. The resulting street, Mowbray Arch, soon became the favored location for the stately houses of Norfolk's middle and upper-middle-class residents. Development was rapid over the next decade, and spread to encompass over thirty blocks, most of what is now considered Historic Ghent. The Ghent Historic District is a national historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1980. It encompasses 184 contributing buildings and one contributing site in a primarily residential section of the neighborhood. Numerous residences in the area are principal examples of Queen Anne revival, Colonial Revival, and Tudor Revival style homes. Notable buildings include the Warren (c. 1925), the Holland (1904), the Mowbray (c. 1914), Eastern Virginia Medical School, Sarah Leigh Hospital (1902), Fergus Reid residence (1892), the Frank S. Royster residence (c. 1900-02), the William H. White residence (c. 1892), the Richard B. Tunstall residence (c. 1892), the Robert M. and Robert W. Hughes residence (c. 1895-1900), and the William Tait residence (c. 1895). and Accompanying photo and Accompanying map The neighborhood went into steep decline in the years following World War II as a result of white flight and urban blight. Upper and middle class families flocked from the city to suburbia for reasons mostly associated with racial self-segregation. During this time, much of the neighborhood fell into disrepair; blight became so severe that portions of Ghent were referred to as slums by then Mayor of Norfolk, Pretlow Darden. As of today only a few of the areas' original public buildings remain with the notable exceptions of Maury High School and the Van Wyck branch of the Norfolk Public Library due to extensive urban renewal programs that followed a raze and rebuild tactic as a part of Franklin D. Roosevelt's broader New Deal ideology. Norfolk secured its first grant for urban renewal in 1949; renewal was extensively focused on preservation of the Ghent neighborhood. Under these programs, as well as implementation of numerous housing codes over the course of two decades the neighborhood had been successful in its gentrification and revitalization efforts by the mid-1970s. Gentrification continues to spread out northward and eastward from Ghent proper to this day.

The Naro Theater is also the stage for a recurring Rocky Horror Picture Show shadow cast, purportedly one of the longest-running in the country, at over 30 years of consistent monthly productions. Also within Ghent's commercial district are multiple independent art galleries displaying and selling local artists' works. Norfolk's major art museum is the Chrysler Museum of Art. The museum features more than 50 galleries, a restaurant and catering facilities. Across from the Chrysler Museum is Virginia Opera's home stage, the Harrison Opera House. Ghent celebrates several cultural and art festivals which include Ghent Pride Festival each June, and the annual St. Patrick‚Äôs Day street festival. The Bi-annual Stockley Gardens Arts Festival operates in the spring and fall. =Culinary= On Monticello Avenue, Doumar's Cones and BBQ famously created the ice cream cone, and the world's first waffle ice cream cone machine.

Built by the Kingston Shipbuilding Company and launched in September 1917, she was commissioned in August 1918. Decommissioned in 1920, Loos was transferred to the Department of Marine and Fisheries, where she was used as a lighthouse supply ship. Sold in 1937, she was re-acquired by the RCN in December 1940 and converted to a gate vessel, spending part of the war at Shelburne, Nova Scotia. Returned to Marine Industries Limited in 1945, Loos was broken up in 1949. Design and description The RCN's Battle-class trawlers formed part of the Canadian naval response to Admiralty warnings to Canada about the growing German U-boat threat to merchant shipping in the western Atlantic.Tucker, p. 253 Intended to augment anti-submarine patrols off Canada's east coast, these ships were modelled on contemporary British North Sea trawlers, since the standard types of Canadian fishing vessels were considered unsuitable for patrol work.Tucker, pp. 254, 257 Twelve vessels were ordered on 2 February 1917 from two shipyards, Polson Iron Works of Toronto and Canadian Vickers of Montreal.Johnston et al., p. 417 Two of those contracts awarded to Canadian Vickers were subcontracted to Kingston Shipbuilding of Kingston, Ontario. Those vessels retained the same design as those built in Montreal.Johnston et al., p. 484 Those ships constructed using the Canadian Vickers design displaced and were long overall with a beam of and a draught of .Macpherson and Barrie, p. 27 The vessels were propelled by a steam-powered triple expansion engine driving one shaft creating giving the vessels a maximum speed of .Maginley and Collin, p. 67 All twelve trawlers were equipped with a QF 12-pounder 12 cwt naval gun mounted forward. This was considered to be the smallest gun that stood a chance of putting a surfaced U-boat out of action, and they also carried a small number of depth charges.Tucker, p. 257 The trawlers were named after battles of the Western Front during the First World War that Canadians had been involved in. They cost between $155,000 and $160,000 per vessel. Service history Named after the Battle of Loos, the ship was constructed by Kingston Shipbuilding at Kingston, Ontario and launched on 27 September 1917.Macpherson and Barrie, p. 29 Intended for use during the 1917 shipping season, the construction of the vessels was delayed by the entry of the United States into the war. With higher wages found south of the border, a shortage of skilled labour developed in the shipyards, coupled with a shortage of construction material.Johnston et al., pp. 481‚Äì484 The six vessels ordered from Canadian Vickers were delayed further by difficulty in providing engines for the trawlers. The hulls had been finished during Summer 1917. However, the engines did not arrive until the fall. Loos was commissioned on 1 August 1918. Loos sailed to the east coast where for the 1918 shipping season, all the Battle-class trawlers were assigned to patrol and escort duties based out of Sydney, Nova Scotia.Johnston et al., pp. 543, 645 The trawler performed these duties until the end of the war, and remained in service until 1920, when she was paid off by the RCN. The Department of Marine and Fisheries took over the vessel and converted Loos to a lighthouse supply and buoy vessel in 1922.Maginley and Collin, pp. 67, 113 In the late 1930s, the vessel was sold out of government service to Marine Industries. However, the RCN reacquired the vessel on 12 December 1940. The former trawler was converted to a gate vessel and re-designated Gate Vessel 14 and deployed at Shelburne, Nova Scotia. Following the war, the ship was returned to Marine Industries and broken up in 1949.

After seeing service on Canada's east coast at the end of the First World War, Thiepval was transferred to the west coast, where she spent the remainder of her career. In 1924, Thiepval visited the Soviet Union and Japan as part of the support efforts for a round-the-world flight attempt. Thiepval struck a rock and sank off the British Columbia coast in 1930, and her wreck has since become a popular attraction for divers. Design and construction Thiepval formed part of the Canadian naval response to Admiralty warnings to Canada about the growing German U-boat threat to merchant shipping in the western Atlantic. Intended to augment anti-submarine patrols off Canada's east coast, the RCN's Battle-class trawlers were modelled on contemporary North Sea trawlers, since the standard types of Canadian fishing vessels were considered unsuitable for patrol work. The resulting design was a -long vessel with a beam of , a draught, and a top speed of , which made it roughly comparable to the Royal Navy's s. The QF 12-pounder () 12 cwt gun that was the Battle-class trawlers' main armament was considered to be the smallest gun that stood a chance of putting a surfaced U-boat out of action, and they also carried a small number of depth charges. Built by shipyards on the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River at a cost of some $191,000 each, the trawlers were named after battles of the Western Front. Construction took longer than expected, and the ships entered service relatively late in the war. Thiepval, named after the 1916 Battle of Thiepval Ridge, was built by the Kingston Shipbuilding Company in Kingston, Ontario. Launched in 1917, she was commissioned into the RCN on 24 July 1918. Service history Thiepval spent the last months of the war in service on Canada's east coast, carrying out escort and patrol operations. In early 1919, as part of the reallocation of ships in Canada's greatly reduced postwar navy, she accompanied , , and on a trip via the Panama Canal to the west coast. Decommissioned at Esquimalt, British Columbia on 19 March 1920, Thiepval was transferred to the Department of Marine and Fisheries as a patrol vessel. Thiepvals duties included taking part in winter-time search and rescue patrols off the west coast of Vancouver Island. Initiated by the RCN after the First World War, the patrols were a response to the dangerous waters off Vancouver Island, which were considered part of the Graveyard of the Pacific. In addition to search and rescue patrols, the trawler also carried out fisheries protection work, sometimes seizing US fishing boats that had entered Canadian waters. Thiepval also carried out seal counts as part of the North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911. On at least one occasion, she intercepted rum-runners near the Alaska border. In her first few years on the west coast, Thiepval struck rocks twice: in 1920, near Prince Rupert, and in 1921 in Gunboat Passage near Bella Bella, but on both occasions suffered relatively little damage. =1924 trip to the Soviet Union and Japan= HMCS Thiepval in Petropavlovsk, 1924. Reacquired by the RCN, Thiepval was recommissioned in April 1923, and in February 1924 was given the task of helping to support the round-the-world flight attempt of Major Stuart-MacLaren. Proceeding across the North Pacific via the Aleutian Islands and the Kamchatka Peninsula, Thiepval arrived in Hakodate, Japan, carrying supplies and equipment for the Vickers Vulture flying boat and its crew. In the process, Thiepval became the first Canadian warship to visit the Soviet Union and Japan. The Canadian government had also given Thiepval the secret assignment of investigating American and Japanese territories in the North Pacific to see if they were being fortified in contravention of the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty; it turned out that they were not. After waiting in Hakodate for the flight to approach Japan, Thiepval headed back to the Soviet Union, where she waited for the aircraft and its crew in Petropavlovsk. After arriving on 24 July, the flight was delayed by bad weather until 4 August, when it departed on its next leg. Heavy fog forced an emergency landing at sea, where the aircraft was badly damaged by waves before coming ashore at Nikolskoye, on Bering Island. Thiepval, steaming through the night, rescued the flyers and salvaged the wreckage of their aircraft before sailing for Vancouver. During their stay in Hakodate, Thiepvals crew acquired a brown bear, which they brought back to Esquimalt as a mascot. Called Bruno, or sometimes \\"Haca-Daddy\\", the bear became addicted to the alcohol given to him by sailors, who also took him along when they went drinking in local taverns. Bruno ultimately died after eating poisonous dockyard supplies. =Later service and loss= Following her return from the trans-Pacific voyage, Thiepval returned to patrol work and training duties. In 1925, she came to the assistance of another Battle-class trawler, Armenti√®res, which had struck a rock in Pipestem Inlet in Barkley Sound. The following year, she towed the Mexican schooner Chapultepec off the rocks at Carmnanah Point, on the southwest coast of Vancouver Island. Mostly, however, her routine consisted of fisheries and search and rescue patrols, as well as chasing rum-runners. On 27 February 1930, Thiepval was on patrol when she struck an uncharted rock in the Broken Islands of Barkley Sound on British Columbia's coast. Because the vessel had come to rest on a rock ledge, there was some hope that she could be salvaged, and Armenti√®res came to the ship's assistance. The damage proved too great, however, and she sank the following day in the channel that now bears her name. In 1962, three years after the wreck had been located, divers recovered Thiepvals deck gun, which is now displayed in the fishing village of Ucluelet. Lying in just of water, the wreck is accessible to sport divers and has become a popular dive site. In 1970, the wreck was made a part of Parks Canada's Pacific Rim National Park Reserve as a Shipwreck of National Historical Significance. In 2011, the Department of National Defence organized a survey of the wreck site following reports of unexploded munitions being seen by divers. In March 2017, The Royal Canadian Navy sent divers to conduct a survey of the wreck and develop a plan to remove the unexploded munitions. Removal and disposal of the unexploded ordnance was expected to occur in mid-2017.

It is more commonly known as the Knox Bible or Knox Version.http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,853431,00.html Origin and publication In 1936, Ronald Knox was requested by the Catholic hierarchies of England and Wales to undertake a new translation of the Vulgate with use of contemporary language and in light of Hebrew and Greek manuscripts. When the New Testament was published in 1945, it was not intended to replace the Rheims version but to be used alongside it, as Bernard Griffin, the Archbishop of Westminster, noted in the preface. With the release of Knox's version of the Old Testament in 1950, the popularity of translations based on the Vulgate waned as Church authorities promoted the use of Bibles based primarily on Hebrew and Greek texts following the 1943 encyclical Divino afflante Spiritu. The Knox Bible was, however, one of the approved vernacular versions of the Bible used in the Lectionary readings for Mass from 1965 to the early 1970s, along with the Confraternity Bible. Style The style of the translation is in idiomatic English and much freer in renderings of passages than the Douay version. With the Deuterocanonical books, the interpretation of the passages was brought closer to the Septuagint. When the Latin appeared to be doubtful, the translation of the text was based on other languages, with the Latin translation placed in the footnote. Later editions Templegate Publishers produced a facsimile of the New Testament in 1997 ().Templegate Publishers Baronius Press secured the rights for the work from the Archdiocese of Westminster in 2009 and their new leather-bound edition of Monsignor Knox's translation was published in October 2012. The Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, commented on the new Baronius Press edition that \\"Ronald Knox's translation of the Bible remains an exceptional achievement both of scholarship and of literary dedication. Again and again it successfully avoids conventional options and gives the scriptural text a fresh flavour, often with a brilliantly idiosyncratic turn of phrase.

The state forest centers around Mount Grace, which at is the third highest point in Massachusetts east of the Connecticut River after Mount Wachusett and Mount Watatic. It is bordered by portions of Warwick State Forest to the east and west and is managed by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation. History Mount Grace is said to be named after the baby daughter of Mary Rowlandson, a woman captured by Wompanoag warriors during King Philip's War, who according to legend buried her deceased infant at the foot of the mountain during the march to Canada. By the turn of the 20th century, the mountain had been largely deforested, and conservationists, including former Warwick resident Dr. Paul W. Goldsbury, promoted the idea of having the state purchase it to create a state forest. Picnic and skiing facilities were built beginning in 1930,Charles Morse, Warwick, Massachusetts: Biography of a Town (Cambridge: Dresser, Chapman, and Grimes, 1963), p. 179 after legislation for the purchase passed in 1920. Crews with the Civilian Conservation Corps contributed summer and winter recreational features that included a snowshoeing trail. The summit's fire lookout tower was built in 1939. It is accessible to the public and offers impressive views of the surrounding areas. It is the third tower to have been constructed on Mount Grace. Activities and amenities Forest trails used for hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking, and cross-country skiing include a portion of the long-distance Metacomet-Monadnock Trail. The forest also offers picnicking and restricted hunting.

He was known as \\"The Knight of Allah's Prophet\\".Muhammad ibn Saad. Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir vol. 3. Translated by Bewley, A. (2013). The Companions of Badr. London: Ta-Ha Publishers. Early life He was born in Medina c.588 or c.591 as a member of the Khazraj tribe. His father was Maslama ibn Khalid from the al-Harith clan; his mother was Umm Sahm Khulayda bint Abi Ubayda from the Sa'ida clan.Muhammad ibn Ishaq. Sirat Rasul Allah. Translated by Guillaume, A. (1955). The Life of Muhammad. Oxford: Oxford University Press. He is described as a large, tall, black man, stout and bald. For some reason he lost the support of the Khazraj tribe. He went to the Nadir tribe, who offered to feed him at their expense and to convert him to Judaism. He told them that he wanted food but that he would never become a Jew; and they provided for him.Muhammad ibn Umar al-Waqidi. Kitab al-Maghazi. Translated by Faizer, R., Ismail, A., & Tayob, A. K. (2011). The Life of Muhammad. Abingdon, Oxfordshire & New York: Routledge. Later he became an ally (halif) of the Za'ura ibn Abdalashhal clan of the Aws tribe. Conversion to Islam Ibn Maslamah was one of the first people in Medina to become a Muslim. This was in the period 621-622, before Muhammad's arrival, under the influence of Mus‚Äòab ibn 'Umair. After Muhammad arrived, he made Ibn Maslama brother in Islam to Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah. Thereafter he was constantly involved in Muhammad's military affairs. Military career under Muhammad =Early events= He fought at the Battle of Badr in March 624. When the Muslims defeated the Qaynuqa tribe in April 624, Ibn Maslamah supervised their expulsion from Medina and the seizure of their possessions. Muhammad awarded him a coat of mail. When Muhammad called for the assassination of Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf in September 624, Ibn Maslamah volunteered for the task. Ibn Maslamah pretended to Ibn al-Ashraf that he needed a loan and offered to leave his weapons with him as security. Ibn al-Ashraf therefore came out to meet him and four others by night when they were fully armed. They caught him off-guard and killed him.Bukhari 3:45:687.Bukhari 4:52:270.Bukhari 4:52:271.Bukhari 5:59:369.Muslim 19:4436.Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari. Tarikh al-Rusul wa'l-Muluk. Translated by McDonald, M. V. (1987). Volume 7: The Foundation of the Community. Albany: State University of New York Press. At the Battle of Uhud in April 625, Ibn Maslamah was put in charge of fifty men who were tasked with patrolling the camp at night.Muir, W. (1912).The Life of Mohammad from Original Sources, 4th Ed., pp. 256-267. Edinburgh: John Grant. Ibn Maslamah was one of the few who stood by Muhammad when the majority retreated. In August 625 it was Ibn Maslamah who brought the message to the Nadir tribe that Muhammad wanted them to leave their land within ten days or he would cut off their heads. They replied: \\"We did not think that an Aws man would bring such a message!\\" Ibn Maslamah said, \\"Hearts have changed.\\" Later, when the Nadir tribe surrendered to Muhammad and were expelled from Medina, it was Ibn Maslamah who supervised their exit and collected all their confiscated property and weapons. He was involved with the cattle-raid on Dumat al-Jandal in August/September 626. Ibn Maslamah was the only Muslim who captured a human prisoner; the other raiders only stole cattle and camels. =Trench and Qurayza= At the Battle of the Trench in the spring of 627, he guarded Muhammad's tent by night. The following month, he was among the besiegers of the Qurayza tribe. When the Qurayza were captured, Ibn Maslamah was the one who tied the prisoners' wrists. He was commanding the guard during the night when the Jewish warriors were awaiting execution. A Jew named 'Amr ibn Suda passed the guard during the night, slipped out of Medina and was never seen again. Ibn Maslamah told Muhammad that he had deliberately allowed 'Amr to escape because he had not participated in the treachery of the Qurayza. Muhammad accepted this story and said that God had delivered 'Amr because of his faithfulness.Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari. Tarikh al-Rusul wa'l-Muluk. Translated by Fishbein, M. (1997). Volume 8: The Victory of Islam. Albany: State University of New York Press. When the Qurayza prisoners were being sold, Ibn Maslamah bought a woman and her two sons for 45 dinars. He was awarded three portions in the battle- plunder because he had brought a horse to the battle. His horse's name was Dhu'l-Limma. =Minor engagements 627-628= Ibn Maslamah led thirty cavalry on the raid to al-Qurata in June 627. They marched by night and hid by day. At al-Sharaba they attacked the Bakr clan of the Kilab tribe and killed ten of them. Then they drove the cattle, 150 camels and 3000 sheep back to Medina. The following month Muhammad sent him with ten men to Ghatafan territory in Dhu‚Äôl-Qassa. They arrived by night but could not see any people. As they slept, a hundred men surrounded them. When the ambushers started shooting arrows, Ibn Maslamah was the first to awaken, shouting, \\"The weapons!\\" The Muslims jumped up and fired in the dark for an hour. The Bedouins threw spears and killed three of them; the Muslims killed one; then the ambushers killed seven more. Ibn Maslamah fell with a wounded ankle but was the only survivor. The Bedouins stripped the corpses and departed. Later, a Muslim happened to pass the site, and on finding Ibn Maslamah alive, he gave him food and water and transported him back to Medina. He was present at al-Muraysi in January 628. When Abdullah ibn Ubayy was heard making remarks about the Muslim immigrants, Umar suggested that Ibn Maslamah should cut off Ibn Ubayy's head. But Muhammad would not allow this. He was among the twenty horsemen sent as an advance guard to Hudaybiyyah and he was on the night-watch roster. One night the Quraysh sent fifty men to the Muslim camp. Ibn Maslamah managed to capture them and bring them to Muhammad. According to one tradition, he was later a witness to the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah; but an alternative tradition asserts that the witness was his brother Mahmud. =Khaybar= At the Battle of Khaybar in May/July 628, it was Ibn Maslamah who located the best site for the Muslim camp. On the first day of the fighting, his brother Mahmud was killed while he was sitting in the shade of Fort Na'im. Inside the fortress, the Jewish warrior Marhab threw down a millstone, which landed on Mahmud's head. Mahmud took three days to die, in which time Ibn Maslamah promised to provide for his brother's daughters. On the same day he avenged his brother. Marhab came out of the fortress, challenging the Muslims to single combat. Ibn Maslamah volunteered because, \\"I am a wronged and angry person. Permit me to fight Marhab, for he is the killer of my brother.\\" A tree stood between them, and each slashed at the branches until they were all cut away and the two warriors were face to face. Marhab struck Ibn Maslamah, who caught the blow on his shield. Then Ibn Maslamah slashed at Marhab's thighs and felled him. He shouted, \\"Taste death, just as my brother Mahmud tasted it!\\" but before he could strike the death-blow, Ali passed by and cut off Marhab's head. This entitled Ali to take the booty; but Ibn Maslamah challenged him, and after they referred their dispute to Muhammad, he granted Marhab's sword, shield, cap and helmet to Ibn Maslamah. Ibn Maslamah then killed a warrior named Yusayr. He was among those who shielded Muhammad when they besieged the fortress of al-Saab ibn Muadh. After the battle, Kinana ibn al-Rabi was tortured by al-Zubayr ibn al-Awwam in the hope that he would reveal where he had hidden the treasure of the Abu'l-Huqayq clan. When Kinana was no longer able to speak, Muhammad ordered al-Zubayr to hand him over to Ibn Maslama. Ibn Maslama was allowed to cut off Kinana's head in revenge for his brother Mahmud.Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari. Tarikh al-Rusul wa'l-Muluk. Translated by Poonawala, I. K. (1990). Volume 9: The Last Years of the Prophet. Albany: State University of New York Press. When Khaybar was divided among the Muslims, Ibn Maslamah was awarded one share in Wadi'l-Qura. =Later events= On the Minor Pilgrimage of 629 Muhammad sent ahead of him a hundred horsemen, led by Ibn Maslamah. The Quraysh were frightened by their approach, and Muhammad had to reassure them that he had no military intentions. Ibn Maslamah was among those who fought in the Conquest of Mecca in January 630. When Muhammad circumambulated the Kaaba on his camel al-Qaswa, just before destroying its idols, Ibn Maslamah was holding the camel's reins. The only battle in which he did not fight was Tabuk, for on that occasion Muhammad appointed him governor over Medina. Family Ibn Maslamah had ten sons and six daughters by seven different women. # Umm Amr bint Salama of the Abdul- Ashhal clan of the Aws. Her brother was present at the Second pledge at al- Aqabah, and she was one of the women who gave allegiance to Muhammad.Muhammad ibn Saad. Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir vol. 8. Translated by Bewley, A. (1995). The Women of Madina. London: Ta-Ha Publishers. ## Abdulrahman ## Umm Isa ## Umm al-Harith # Amra bint Masud of the Zafar clan of the Aws. She and her daughter, together with her mother, sister and niece, were among the first women in Medina who gave allegiance to Muhammad. ## Abdullah ## Umm Ahmad # Qutayla bint al-Husayn of the Murra branch of the Qays ibn Aylan tribe. ## Saad ## Jaafar ## Umm Zayd # Zahra bint Ammar of the Murra branch of the Qays ibn Aylan tribe. ## Umar # A woman from the Atba clan of the Kalb tribe. ## Anas ## Amra # A concubine. ## Qays ## Zayd ## Muhammad # Another concubine. ## Mahmud ## Hafsa He encouraged his children to ask him about Muhammad's military expeditions. He said he knew about all of them first-hand, except for Tabuk, which he had heard about directly from its participants. He carved a sword out of wood and put it on a bowl hung up in his house \\"in order to alarm the anxious\\". The Caliphate of Abu Bakr During the Caliphate Ibn Maslamah worked as a tax-collector, bringing in the zakat that was due from the Ashja tribe.Malik ibn Anas, Al-Muwatta 17:29. When Abu Bakr raised the legal question of the inheritance due to a grandmother, Ibn Maslamah testified that Muhammad had allocated her one-sixth of the estate.Malik ibn Anas, Al-Muwatta 27:4. The Caliphate of Umar Umar once asked about the blood-money required for the killing of an unborn child by assaulting its mother. Ibn Maslamah testified that Muhammad had set the price at \\"a high-quality slave\\" of either sex.Bukhari 9:83:42.Muslim 16:4174.Bukhari 9:92:420. When Amr ibn al-Aas requested reinforcements during his expedition to Egypt, Ibn Maslamah was one of those sent by Umar at the head of a detachment of a thousand men.Butler, A. J. (1978). The Arab Conquest of Egypt and the Last Thirty Years of the Roman Dominion, 2nd. Ed., pp. 226, 229. Oxford: Oxford University Press. In 638 Umar sent Ibn Maslamah to the newly founded settlement of Kufa. Saad ibn Abi Waqqas had built a public citadel next door to his own house. The noise from the nearby market was so deafening that Saad had built a locked gate into the citadel to prevent people from entering the public area. Ibn Maslamah was tasked with destroying the gate, which he did by setting fire to it. He refused all Saad's offers of hospitality, but handed him a missive from Umar reminding him that the citadel should be available to the public and suggesting that he move his house. Saad denied to Ibn Maslamah that he had made the alleged remarks (\\"Stop that terrible noise\\"). Ibn Maslamah did not take enough supplies for his homeward journey. By the time he reached Medina he was so hungry that he ate tree-bark, and he presented himself to Umar suffering from indigestion. Umar asked if he had brought \\"anything\\" from Saad, and Ibn Maslamah replied that he had not received any orders about this. Umar then rebuked him for his lack of initiative.Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari. Tarikh al-Rusul wa'l-Muluk. Translated by Juynboll, G. H. A. (1989). Volume 13: The Conquest of Iraq, Southwestern Persia, and Egypt. Albany: State University of New York Press. By 642 Ibn Maslamah was acting as the overseer of Umar's governors: his job was to investigate whether correct action had been taken over any complaints. There were more complaints against Saad ibn Abi Waqqas on the eve of the Persian war, and Ibn Maslamah was sent to back Kufa to investigate. He visited all the local mosques and heard all the complaints in public. Nearly everyone expressed satisfaction with Saad's conduct as governor; but eventually there was an accusation that he did not divide up the battle-plunder equally, did not fight enough wars, did not say the prayers correctly and spent too much time hunting. Ibn Maslamah took Saad and his accusers back to Umar. Umar found that Saad was indeed guilty of deviating from the prescribed ritual for prayer, which meant that the accusations, while exaggerated, had some foundation. Saad was replaced with his deputy. Ibn Maslamah was involved in a civil dispute with a neighbour, al- Dahhak ibn Khalifa, who wanted to divert a stream through Ibn Maslama's property. Ibn Maslama refused permission even when Ibn Khalifa reminded him that it could not harm him and he would have unlimited rights to take the water. Ibn Khalifa referred the case to Umar, and Ibn Maslama repeated to the Caliph that he would not allow it. But Umar overruled him, and the stream was diverted as Ibn Khalifa had wished.Malik ibn Anas, Al-Muwatta 36:1437. The Caliphate of Uthman Ibn Maslama continued to act as inspector under Uthman. In 655 Uthman sent him to Kufa to investigate certain complaints; but Ibn Maslamah reported back that he had found nothing amiss.Muhammad ibn Jarir al- Tabari. Tarikh al-Rusul wa'l-Muluk. Translated by Humphreys, R. S. (1990). Volume 15: The Crisis of the Early Caliphate. Albany: State University of New York Press. He remained a supporter of Uthman. When Uthman warned from the pulpit that the Egyptian rebels had been cursed by Muhammad, Ibn Maslamah stood up and declared, \\"I bear witness to that.\\" He was immediately seized and forced to sit down. Uthman later sent Ibn Maslamah along with Ali to lead a delegation to order the Egyptian dissidents out of Medina. When unrest continued, Ibn Maslamah set out with fifty cavalry to negotiate with the Egyptians. He entered their leaders' tent and stressed Uthman's rights and how they had bound themselves to his leadership in their oath of allegiance. He warned them of the dangers of civil war and of what might happen if Uthman were killed. Then he offered himself as a guarantor that Uthman would meet the Egptians' demands. One of them asked, \\"What if Uthman doesn't change?\\" and Ibn Maslama replied, \\"Then it will be up to you.\\" Immediately afterwards Ibn Maslamah requested a private audience with the Caliph and warned him, \\"Fear Allah, Uthman, and fear for your life! These people are only here to kill you, and you see how your friends have not only abandoned you but are also going over to your enemy.\\" Uthman spoke acquiescing words but made no changes. The Egyptians then returned to Medina. Uthman asked Ibn Maslamah's advice, but all he could say was, \\"They have bad intentions.\\" Uthman told him to send the Egyptians away again, but Ibn Maslamah replied, \\"I will not. I promised them that you would stop doing certain things, but you have not stopped a single one.\\" Uthman appealed for God's help. Soon afterwards the Egyptians besieged his house. The Egyptians approached Ibn Maslamah directly to advise him of the discovery of a letter in which Uthman had ordered various officials to be flogged. Ibn Maslamah accompanied Ali to an audience with Uthman, where Ali voiced this allegation. Uthman denied all knowledge of the letter; Ibn Maslamah and Ali believed him and decided that it must have been forged by Marwan. Ali told Uthman that he must repeat his denial in the hearing of the Egyptians. The Egyptians entered and repeated all their complaints, and Uthman repeated his denial of the letter. The Egyptians countered that if he was so incompetent that it was possible for someone to forge letters by appropriating his personal scribe, seal, slave and camel, then he ought to abdicate anyway. Uthman refused to abdicate the office to which God had appointed him, and the interview became loud. Ibn Maslama and Ali managed to usher them out of Uthman's presence before there was any physical violence, but the siege of Uthman's house continued. The Caliphate of Ali After Uthman was assassinated, Ibn Maslamah was one of the few who did not give allegiance to Ali.Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari. Tarikh al-Rusul wa'l-Muluk. Translated by Brockett, A. (1997). Volume 16: The Community Divided. Albany: State University of New York Press. Later, when a messenger from Basra asked if the Muslims had sworn allegiance to Ali freely or under coercion, Usama ibn Zayd replied, \\"They were definitely coerced!\\" Some of Ali's supporters leapt to attack Usama, and Ibn Maslamah was among those who jumped up to protect him. Suhayb ibn Sinan managed to calm down the immediate situation, but the reports of half-hearted support for Ali returned both to him and to his opponents. Muhammad had given Ibn Maslamah a sword, saying, \\"Fight the idolators with it when they fight. When you see the Muslims facing one another, take it to Uhud and strike it until it breaks. Then sit in your house until it ends.\\" When the civil war broke out, Ibn Maslamah took the sword that Muhammad had given him and broke it. During the period of strife, Subayaa ibn Husayn al-Thaalabi saw a tent set up by a well in the desert. He was told that it belonged to Muhammad ibn Maslamah, who was by then an old man. Subayaa asked Ibn Maslamah why he was living there. Ibn Maslamah replied that he had left Medina because he hated evil. Death Muhammad ibn Maslamah died in Medina in May/June 663Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari. Tarikh al-Rusul wa'l-Muluk. Translated by Morony, M. G. (1987).

His principal seat was his manor of Vik in Balingsta, Uppland. Through his paternal grandmother Ramborg Israelsdotter And, younger Arvid descended from the And family. His grandfather Arvid Gustavsson had the same name and coat of arms. Younger Arvid Gustavsson's father was Gustav Arvidsson, knight and member of the Privy Council of Sweden, justiciar of S√∂dermanland, whose seat probably already was Vik. Arvid's mother probably (but not certainly, because some history gives him as son of a second wife of his father, of whose existence and name there are however no contemporary evidence) was Kristina Petersdotter of the tre rutor family, daughter of Birgitta Jonsdotter, possibly of the Aspen√§s family, and certainly widow of Erengisle N√§skonungsson, Lord High Constable of Sweden. The younger Arvid Gustafsson was member of the Privy Council of Sweden from 1362, and from 1366 lawspeaker of Finland, Swedish province. His wife was Helena Magnusdotter, daughter of Birgitta Knutsdotter of the Algotss√∂ner family and Magnus Gislason, PC, Lord of Aspn√§s, who also bore spar as his Coat of Arms, and is therefore also dubbed as \\"Sparre\\" (Sparre of Aspn√§s) in genealogies. Magnus Gislason's line and Gustav/Arvid line may well have been of the same origin, but there exists no evidence of that. Helena and Arvid inherited the manor of √ñrby when her parents' inheritance was divided between her and her full sister (whose family received Aspn√§s). Her half-sister had been the first wife of Charles Ulvsson, Lord of Tofta, thus a brother-in-law of Arvid. Arvid and Helena had an only surviving child, daughter Margareta Arvidsdotter (died on 9 April 1415), who became their heiress. Margareta married sir Ture Bengtsson (of the Bielke, died 20 November 1414), PC, justiciar of Uppland. Their descendants inherited Vik, √ñrby etc., a veritable bunch of properties in Uppland, which ultimately ended to their descendants the Vasa, and its scion, the king Gustav I. Justiciar Arvid died either in 1379 or 1380. His father's first name was given to his 7th-generation descendant who became Gustav I of Sweden and because of whom, the name Gustav has since remained in common names of Swedish royal families.

Following the war, Festubert remained in Canadian service as a training ship until 1934. Reactivated for the Second World War, the ship was used as a gate vessel in the defence of Halifax, Nova Scotia and re-designated Gate Vessel 17. Following the war, the trawler was sold for commercial use and renamed Inverleigh. Inverleigh was scuttled off Burgeo, Newfoundland on 30 June 1971.

This was considered to be the smallest gun that stood a chance of putting a surfaced U-boat out of action, and they also carried a small number of depth charges.Tucker, p. 257 The trawlers were named after battles of the Western Front during the First World War that Canadians had been involved in. They cost between $155,000 and $160,000 per vessel. Service history Built by Polson Iron Works at Toronto, Festubert, named for the Battle of Festubert, was launched on 2 August 1917.Macpherson and Barrie, p. 28 Intended for use during the 1917 shipping season, the construction of the vessels was delayed by the entry of the United States into the war. With higher wages found south of the border, a shortage of skilled labour developed in the shipyards, coupled with a shortage of construction material.Johnston et al., pp. 481‚Äì484 The trawler was commissioned on 13 November 1917.

The office holder was a member of the Swedish Privy Council and, from 1630 and on, the head of the Swedish Council of War. From 1634, the Lord High Constable was one of five Great Officers of the Realm. Middle Ages Karl Knutsson Bonde - Lord High Constable 1435-?. In a letter from 1268, during the reign of Valdemar Birgersson, the title marscalcus of the king is mentioned. The holder of the prestigious title is a nobleman, but it is not possible to decide much about the assignments belonging to it. It is possible that the marsk, or the constable, replaced the stabularius that previously governed the king's mounted following. Constable Torgils Knutsson was the foremost among the powerful men that ruled Sweden during the childhood of king Birger Magnusson in the late 13th century. Later constables seem to only occasionally be called upon by the king, without having regular tasks to fulfill. Queen Margaret, who tried to reclaim power that previous kings had lost, chose to have neither a Lord High Constable nor a Lord High Steward. Her successor Eric of Pomerania was forced by the Swedish noblemen to appoint a constable. Thus, in 1435, Karl Knutsson Bonde, a future Swedish king, became the first constable for quite some time. In a suggestion to a treaty of the Kalmar union from 1436, the constable got responsibilities in two areas: law/justice and heading the country's army in war time. For most of the remaining part of the 15th century, the office was vacant. Early modern period Jacob De la Gardie - Lord High Constable 1620‚Äì1652. Lars Siggesson Sparre, long-time constable of Gustav I, was a significant figure during his king's reign, but the office seemingly still lacked any specific assignment. When something reminiscent of a council of war was founded in 1540, the constable was not included. King Gustav's successor, his oldest son Eric XIV, apparently had plans to modernize the constable office, as did the following rulers John III and Sigismund, but those intentions remained unfulfilled. Carl Gustaf Wrangel - Lord High Constable 1664‚Äì1676. The title meant no particular assignment until 1630, when constable Jacob De la Gardie became president of the Council of War (Swedish: first Krigsr√§tten, later Krigsr√•det and Krigskollegium). The Lord High Constable was second in rank of the five Great Officers of the Realm, established in 1634, who was the five most prominent members of the Swedish Privy Council. When Carl Gustaf Wrangel died in 1676, the office was abolished. King Charles XI, who had come to age four years earlier, wanted to avoid appointing new holders of the high offices, once these became vacant. The riksmarsk title has not been used since, in contrast to two other offices that Charles XI abolished, Lord High Chancellor and Lord High Steward, who were both revived for a relatively short period in the late 18th century. Related offices A number of other high offices, that namewise are somewhat similar to the riksmarsk and to some degree inherited assignments that earlier had been attached to the constable office, have figurated in Swedish history. *The fodermarsk appeared in the late Middle Ages and was responsible for the foddering of the court's horses. *The first hovmarskalk, Marshal of the Court, was appointed in c. 1540 and the office is still in use. Earlier, the office holder was supervising the economy of the court. Today's First Marshal of the Court is the head of the Office of the Marshal of the Court (Hovmarskalk√§mbetet), which is responsible for preparing the public appearances and state visits of the Swedish Royal Family. *G√∂ran Klasson Stjernsk√∂ld became the first riksmarskalk, Marshal of the Realm, in 1607. As such, he was the head of the royal court, and that is still a valid description for the holder of the office.

The PLAN force consists of approximately 250,000 men and over a hundred major combat vessels, organized into three fleets: the North Sea Fleet, the East Sea Fleet, and the South Sea Fleet. Most of the naval weapon systems used by the PLAN were developed prior to 1990. The naval weaponry of the PLAN is based on three tiers: artillery, torpedoes, and missiles, each geared to a specific threat range and type. History Throughout its early history from 1949 to the early 1980s, the PLAN had principally relied upon artillery and torpedoes as its main weapons. This resulted in the development of many types and calibers of anti-aircraft and anti-ship guns. Torpedoes were secondary weapons, playing an important role in PLAN's coastal defense doctrines. Many destroyers, frigates and torpedo craft all carry an array of anti-ship torpedoes to this day. The adoption of the missile, like in most navies, has completely revolutionized Chinese naval capabilities and tactics. Also, there has been growing attention given to ASW, electronic, and airborne weaponry. The Cultural Revolution was a major disruption to many weapons development programs of the PLAN. Advanced weaponry concepts were always in the minds of PLAN thinkers since the 1950s, even if they were unable to be implemented at the time. Therefore, a lot of modern weapon systems such as SAMs, modernized torpedoes and missile/sensor systems were not introduced into service until the early 1980s. Furthermore, economic and technical sophistication to produce the fire control, targeting systems, and tracking capabilities were not in place until the mid-1980s. Artillery systems In the PLAN, artillery takes the form of anti-ship guns and anti-aircraft guns. Anti-ship guns are typically found on destroyers and cruisers, with smaller versions on frigates. Smaller ships utilize torpedoes for anti-ship weaponry. The increasing use of missiles means less attention is paid to pure anti-ship weapons. The PLAN never possessed battleships or battlecruisers, and the use of a ship's main guns is mostly in standoff capacity, as they have never engaged in close-shore support from cruisers or destroyers. Anti-aircraft guns vary in size and power from swivel-mount 25 mm machine guns to advanced Close-In Weapon Systems (CIWS) and radar-assisted 57 mm rapid-fire anti-aircraft weapons. Almost all classes of PLAN vessels maintain at least some anti-aircraft capability. Most destroyers and cruisers augment this with surface-to-air missiles. =Older and legacy artillery systems currently in use= {- valign=top  *Soviet ZIF-32 twin 57 mm open gun mount (Type 66) *Type 76 automatic twin 37 mm open gun mount *Soviet Bu-11 (Type 63) manual twin 37 mm open gun mount *Type 61 twin 25 mm open gun mount  *Soviet 2M-8 (Type 61) manual twin 25 mm open gun mount *Type 69 single or twin 14.5 mm heavy machine gun (open mount) *Single or twin 12.7 mm heavy machine gun (open mount) } The most commonly carried artillery system in most indigenous ships is the 37 mm anti-aircraft artillery (Type-61/76).Chinese Defence Today - Type 61 Dual-37mm Shipboard Antiaircraft Artillery Gun This is a manually operated gun, with a gun crew on an open mount. The Type 61 is carried by most Chinese surface combatants, ranging from the small Shanghai and Hainan coastal combat vessels to the largest combatants of the Luda and Jianghu class. These guns are highly limited‚Äîthey can be operated only in clear weather conditions and are effective only in daylight conditions since they lack radar coordination or any form of automatic or autonomous targeting. They are, however, economical and highly reliable. Their firepower has been effectively utilized not only against aircraft but also against surface and land targets. The old manually operated Type-61 37 mm weapon is gradually being phased out in favor of automatic weaponry, but it nonetheless remains on board many littoral and major combatant vessels. In addition to the manual 37 mm, there is the Type-66 57 mm (120 rounds per minute at 12,000 m) and Type-61 25 mm cannon systems (800 rounds per minute at 2,500 m). These are also manually mounted. The 57 mm is prominent on board the Hainan class and several LSTs. This system like the 37 mm is almost totally ineffective Chinese Defence Today - Type 69 Dual-30mm Automatic Antiaircraft Artillery Gun against modern jet aircraft and incoming missiles. However it has been combat proven to be effective against enemy shipping, particularly in the Sino-Vietnamese naval battle near the Spratley Islands on several occasions. The 25 mm is a one-man operated weapon that complements the larger caliber artillery systems. It remains as a popular gun mount on smaller vessels, particularly landing ships and mine warfare designs. Machine guns such as the 12.7 mm and 14.5 mm are also classified as automatic weapons; being widely operated as short-range self-defense weapons on most amphibious craft. The majority of Chinese naval auxiliary ships possess manually operated anti-aircraft artillery, in contrast to the majority of Western navies, which have few or no armaments on board their auxiliaries. =Current ship artillery systems= Anti-aircraft {- valign=top  *AK-630 *Type 730 CIWS *H/PJ76A automatic twin 37 mm enclosed gun mount *Type 76A automatic twin 37 mm enclosed gun mount *Type 76F automatic twin 37 mm enclosed gun mount *Type 76 automatic twin 37 mm open gun mount *Type 69 automatic twin 25 mm enclosed gun mount *Type 66 automatic twin 57 mm open gun mount  *Type 65 semi- automatic water-cooled twin 37 mm open gun mount *Type 63 automatic twin 37 mm open gun mount *Type 61 semi-automatic air-cooled twin 37 mm open gun mount *Type 61 automatic twin 25 mm enclosed gun mount *Type 76 automatic twin 57 mm open gun mount *Type 66 automatic twin 57 mm open gun mount *Type 59 automatic twin 57 mm open gun mount *AK-230 (Type 69) } Anti-aircraft artillery remains important to PLAN combatants, but its concept has been radically changed recently. All new combatants and those that have been upgraded now possess a fully automatic variant of the 37 mm cannon. This system is known as the Type 76A dual anti-aircraft artillery system (180 rounds per minute engaging at 4,500 m).Chinese Defence Today - Type 76A Dual-37mm Shipboard Antiaircraft Artillery Gun The Type 76A is a direct descendant of the Type 76 twin 37 mm gun, which in turn, is the successor of Type 61 manual twin 37 mm gun. Although the Type 76 twin 37 mm gun is fully automatic, it has an open turret and thus is subject to harsh environment, which causes reliability problems. Another shortcoming of the Type 76 twin 37 mm gun is that like its manually operated predecessor, it lacks fire control systems. Type 76A twin 37 mm gun was thus developed to solve these problems by introducing an enclosed turret and fire control systems. A fire control radar guides these weapons, and can engage targets in most conditions. There is also an optronic device that enables manual and optical aiming. The Type 76F is a Type 76A system with simplified fire control system, which has the electrooptic system but not the radar. Also, there is a console for one human operator inside the gun mount for local manual control, though the gun can be fully automated. Unlike the old manual mounts that require a full crew of men to steer, aim, load, and fire the weapon, the Type 76F requires only one operator to aim the system. In addition to the 37 mm guns, a number of Russian AK-230 were also purchased and reverse engineered (as Type 69) for small boats.

Anti- surface artillery has been primarily based on Soviet designs of 76 mm to 130 mm designs. The Type-76 130 mm twin mount is the main artillery mount on the Luda class destroyers. A more indigenized ship artillery gun system was the Type 79 dual 100 mm gun (as well as single versions). The gun can be operated with one operator or completely automatically guided by radar or optronic aiming. These guns can achieve accurate fire at roughly 25 rounds a minute. A new indigenous 100 mm mount is available on the latest combatants; this is a single rapid fire weapon similar to the French Creusot-Loire weapon. Newer indigenous 130 mm gun systems are also under development. Close-in weapons systems {- valign=top  *H/PJ17  *CS/LK4  *Type 1130  *Type 730  *AK-630  *AK-630 mod  *Kashtan CIWS } Many navies in the world operate a variety of Close In Weapons Systems (CIWS). These systems are designed to engage high speed, low altitude targets at close range. One particular target for the CIWS is incoming anti-ship missiles. A CIWS with its rapid fire and radar control could hopefully defeat incoming missiles. China until very recently has mostly lacked a CIWS system. The Russian built Sovremenny class destroyers that were purchased in a 1996 deal gave China its first CIWS capability. These used a CIWS called the AK630, with mounts that Chinese Defence Today - AK-630 Close-In Weapon System (CIWS) were exclusive to the Russian ships. China, however, has more recently been either able to reverse engineer the AK630 or buy the cannon turrets. These have been fitted on board the Type 054 Ma'anshan class frigates and the new Type 220X missile attack craft. A Chinese system, the Type 730, is China's first entirely indigenous CIWS. Though externally similar to the Dutch Goalkeeper, it is thought to operate indigenous radar and optical systems. It has seven barrels, and fires 30 mm caliber shells in rapid succession (4,500-5,800 rounds per minute). This system has been fitted on board the 052B, 052C and 051C destroyers so far, and is expected to replace some Type 76 mounts on older combatants, as well as being standard for all new surface combatants. The purchase of two additional Sovremenny class destroyers will give PLAN the Kashtan CIWS system (gun and SAM combination). Remote Weapons Stations *ORW-1 *CS/LK4 *H/PJ-15 *H/PJ-17 Torpedoes, mines and ASW weaponry The torpedo is no longer an important anti-ship weapon in the PLAN. However it was very dominant among the coastal attack craft. With the success of torpedo boats in World War I and World War II, the PLAN sought the use of torpedoes in its defense as well. The agility of small coastal craft coupled with fast torpedoes was a grave threat for larger combat vessels. The 1950s, 1960s and 1970s saw a large number of torpedo craft built (as many as 200 operated at one stage). In later years, however, with the increasing inability to even detect Russian or American submarines, the PLAN shifted emphasis from torpedoes to ASW applications and submarines. While most surface combat vessels have some torpedo capability, it is secondary and some ships do not feature torpedo tubes at all. =History and older torpedoes in use= The torpedo programs of the People's Republic of China was set up under the guidance of the former Soviet Union in the 1950s, when China built two torpedo factories under Soviet direction, and began its license assembly of unguided straight-running torpedoes. In April 1958, Naval Arms Ministry of People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) established torpedo research institute indigenously. Four months later, the deputy chief-of-staff of PLA Zhang Aiping and the deputy commander-in-chief of LAN Luo Shunchu (ÁΩóËàúÂàù) led a military delegation to visit former-Soviet Union signed a deal with Soviets to produce three types of Soviet torpedoes in China. In comparison with other military programs, each with dozens or even hundreds of Soviet advisors, however, former-Soviet Union did not put that much emphasis on the torpedo capability: the total number of Soviet advisors initially sent to China for all of its torpedo programs was only five. The Soviet Union quickly delivered the samples and technical information of the three types of torpedoes to China with the five advisors to China as promised. Two Soviet advisors were assigned to assist China to produce the RAT-52 rocket-powered torpedo, while others were assigned to teach China about compressed oxygen and SAET-60 passive homing acoustic homing torpedoes. In July 1960, the first two samples of Chinese-built rocket-propelled torpedoes were completed. The propulsion system and electronics of the electrically powered passive acoustic homing torpedo had also been completed, while the basic technologies of compressed oxygen torpedoes was also mastered by China. Everything appeared to be great but the subsequent Sino-Soviet split ended the promising future: from July 28 to September 1, 1960, former Soviet Union had quickly withdrawn all of its advisors from China. To compound the problem, other domestic political turmoils such as Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution had further seriously hindered the indigenous Chinese torpedo developments. As a result, the most numerous torpedoes in Chinese inventory were unguided straight- running torpedoes. In 1978 the PLAN gained significant torpedo capability when a single US Mk 46 Mod.1 block 2 torpedo, thought to be recovered by fishermen, was reverse-engineered and became the Yu-7 ASW torpedo. It is thought that during the 1980s, the Yu-7 design also benefited from subsequent batches of Mk 46 Mod. 2 torpedoes purchased for PLAN from United States for a total US$8 million in 1985. The Yu-7 has become the foundation of PLAN anti-submarine warfare. Yu-7 is mostly seen carried by the Z-9C and Z-8 helicopters, and shipboard variants can be launched from destroyers and frigates. From October to November 1983, Chinese Northwestern Polytechnical University completed upgrade of the acoustic test facilities under the direction of California Institute of Technology, and this facility played an important role in Chinese torpedo development ever since. In 1993, China ordered three types of Soviet torpedoes along with its purchase of Kilo class submarines: TEST-71, which was replaced by its successor TEST-96 in the 2nd order, and Type 53-65. It is also reported that China had ordered the latest Russian APR-3E light ASW torpedo for its Ka-28 and Be-200 ASW aircraft. =Current torpedoes= {- valign=top  *Yu-1  *Yu-2  *Yu-3  *ET32  *Yu-4  *APR-3E  *A244-S  *Shkval  *ET52  *Yu-5  *ET34  *ET36  *C43  *Yu-6  *Yu-7  *Yu-8  *Yu-9  *Yu-10  *Yu-11 } Chinese submarines have operated a variety of indigenously designed torpedoes. These range from the basic unguided Yu-1 to the much more long-ranged and highly advanced Yu-6. Little has been documented on PLAN torpedo designs. It was thought that PLAN torpedoes were old and lacked the advanced capabilities to home in against agile or quiet targets. However, with the delivery of Russian Kilos, China also obtained some highly advanced Russian torpedo designs. One such weapon is the Wake homing torpedo, which homes on a surface ship's wake rather than just sonar readings. It is believed such technology has been applied to new Chinese torpedoes such as the Yu-5. In addition, Jane's Information Group reported, in the late 1990s, that China had already purchased numerous 200-knot Russian Shkval torpedoes from Kazakhstan and was negotiating in purchasing the Soviet torpedo factory there. =Anti-submarine warfare= {- valign=top  *S3V  *CJ-1  *CY-1  *CY-2  *CY-3  *CY-4  *CY-5  *Yu-8 } ASW warfare apart from torpedoes remains a limited area in the PLAN. PLAN vessels have traditionally utilized depth charges and A/S Mortars. PLAN ships also are commonly armed with multi- barreled ASW rocket launchers. These are based on Russian designs, and are capable of firing rocket bombs at short ranges. It is believedChina's Navy Today to be effective against shallow targets as well as a possible shield of stopping incoming torpedoes. Most PLAN combatants have traditionally two to four multi-barreled launchers in front of the main gun. There has been evidence that PLAN had embarked on developing a modern ASW rocket system similar to the ASROC. This was a medium-ranged rocket that carried a torpedo as its warhead. The system is known to be CY-1Chinese Defence Today - CY-1 Anti-Submarine Rocket (and perhaps a new model the CY-3). CY-1 never entered production however, and its status as an active project is in doubt. PLAN forces have had their ASW capabilities somewhat improved with the introduction of Variable Depth Sonar (VDS), which is mounted on some frigates and destroyers. In addition, PLAN helicopters operate dipping sonar and sonobuoys to enhance their detection capabilities. When targets are found, they can drop depth charges, depth bombs or torpedoes. =Mine warfare= Mine warfare has also been another traditional component of PLAN weaponry. Mines remain to be seen as a very useful power amplifying tool by the PLAN. Strategic minefields could be laid around the Taiwan Strait to deny access or delay deployment of US Navy forces, particularly aircraft carrier battle groups and submarines. Chinese mines have continually been addressed by many analysts and scholars as a very dangerous weapon that could be employed against the US Navy. Most PLAN destroyers, frigates, littoral craft and submarines can lay mines. Chinese mines vary in type, from basic contact/magnetic mines to more modern and complex systems. China first decided to establish dedicated factories for naval mines in 1954, and in 1958, several programs of naval mines were launched simultaneously by Fengxi Machinery Factory. The first of these, Moored-1 (Mao-1), a large sized moored mine entered mass production in 1962 after being tested multiple times and evaluated by the navy. Most early Chinese mines are either Soviet origin, or direct copies of Soviet mines, with the exception of remotely controlled mine. The first three types of naval mines entered the Chinese service are all moored mines equipped with contact fuses, and all of them are developed by the Fengxi Machinery Factory. Moored-1 is a large sized mine and Moored-2 (Mao-2) is a medium-sized mine, a copy of Soviet KSM mine, and both types require target to strike the mine for detonation. Moored-3 (Mao-3) is a mine with contact wires so that targets would not have to strike the mine itself for detonation, and the mine can be detonated some distance away, still causing enough damage if the target is within range and comes in contact with the contact wire. Moored-1 and Moored-2 entered mass production in 1964 and 1965 respectively. In the 1970s, China had successfully developed non-contact fuses such as the acoustic fuse, and earlier contact fuse equipped mines were upgraded with non-contact fuses. Also in 1970, Fengxi Machinery Factory and Engineering Technology Equipment Research Institute begun to jointly develop a riverine moored mine that can be remotely controlled fuse. The project was completed in 1974, and the ultrasonic remote control can be either used to arm or disarm the mines, or alternatively, directly detonate the mine. Since the 1990s, all of mines in the Chinese inventory are upgraded with computerized controls and a new series of Chinese mines were actively marketed for the export, including derivatives from existing mines as well as a brand-new design such as the one similar to American CAPTOR mine. Chinese naval mines with known designations: {- valign=top  *Drifting-2 drifting mine *Moored-1 moored mine (large) *Moored-2 moored mine (medium) *Moored-3 moored mine (contact wires) *Moored-4 moored mine  *Sinking-1 bottom mine *Sinking-2 bottom mine *Sinking-3 bottom mine *Sinking-4 bottom mine *Sinking-5 bottom mine  *Specialized-1 rocket propelled mine *Specialized-2 remotely controlled mine *Training-1 Training mine *Type 500 Training mine *EM12 bottom mine (mainly for export) }  Missiles The PLAN has three main categories of missiles: anti-ship, anti-air and land-attack. =History and use= HY-1 Missile Imported missiles The missile had been an ever-evolving component of PLAN weaponry since the late 1960s. The Soviet Union's assistance to Chinese military developments included the SS-N-2 Styx anti-ship missile technology. Since the 1960s, China has manufactured its own models of anti-ship missile based on the SS-N-2 Styx, in the form of HY-1, SY-1, SY-2, and other airborne and ground-launched systems. The oldest designs have since been phased out, but late variants remain in service. The fundamental shortcoming of missiles based on the SS-N-2 Styx are being short-ranged (only 40‚Äì100 km), slow, low in agility, and is rather large and easily detectable targets for modern SAM and CIWS. Later Chinese variants have vastly superior electronics, radar guidance and performance to the older Soviet models. As China has normalized its relationship with the former Soviet Union and then Russia, the importation of Russian missiles resumed, and a new generation of Russian anti-ship missiles have been imported, including the supersonic SS-N-22 and Kh-31, Klub-S, (the Russian equivalent of the anti-shipping version of American BGM-109 Tomahawk), and AS-20 Uran (the Russian equivalent of the air-launched American AGM-84 anti-shipping Harpoon missile). Indigenous missiles China's first completely indigenous anti-ship missile program was the YJ8 series. This missile externally appears similar to the French Exocet and American Harpoon, but is essentially a Chinese designed weapon system. The basic YJ8 appeared in the early 1980s, with a short range of 22 miles (40 or so km). It was successful in its test launches however, hitting and sinking targets of up to 10,000 tons with a high hit probability. Unlike older designs, the YJ8 could attack targets at low altitudes to reduce its vulnerability to CIWS, and has greater Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) to prevent enemy jamming. The YJ8 entered widespread service, becoming the standard anti-ship missile on most second and third generation Chinese built warships, ranging from destroyers and frigates, to missile craft and submarines. The missile can also be launched from shore platforms and aircraft. Several models of the YJ8 have since emerged. The YJ82 was significantly a better missile with a greatly improved range of 120 km and far more advanced ECM. The latest variant is the YJ-83, with a range exceeding 250 km, and capable of making its final approach at Mach 1.5 to penetrate ship defenses. In addition, a variant revealed at 2006 Zhuhai Airshow designated as C-802KD/YJ-82KD has ground attack capabilities similar to the AGM-84 SLAM. All YJ8 models can be launched from a common boxed launcher. Most littoral combatants carry four to six missiles, while larger surface ships can carry eight. PLAN destroyers have mounted sixteen missiles. Though the YJ8 series does not have the advance 'pop up' approach or checkpoint flight characteristics of the Harpoon, it is respected as one of the most potent anti-ship missiles ever developed. The YJ83's performance in some areas is superior to even the latest variants of Harpoon and Exocet, though its ECM and agility is thought to be slightly inferior. =Current missiles= The PLAN inventory includes a mixture of foreign and domestic missiles, and Russia was the largest foreign provider. Anti-ship missiles Supersonic anti-ship missiles have been a key development in China. The Russian ramjet SS-N-22 Sunburn is operated by China on board its Sovremenny class destroyers. Its high velocity supersonic approach and its large warhead make the SS-N-22 a valuable weapon for the PLAN. China has long sought to produce its own supersonic and eventually hypersonic anti-ship system since the 1980s. High speed missiles are seen as the most effective means of attacking modern warships. Only Russia, China, and India (Brahmos, which was co-developed with Russia) have so far successfully developed and deployed such weapons. Earlier Chinese missiles of such capability from before the 1990s include the C-301 (also known as HY-3). With its four ramjet engines, it has a range of 130 km and a speed greater than Mach 2.5. Though a success, the missile is far from being as potent as the SS-N-22, mainly because it can fly only at a higher cruise altitude of 50 m, rather than cruising at wave tops (such as the 20 m cruise altitude of SS-N-22), so it is easier to intercept in comparison to SS-N-22. the PLAN's air force has also purchased both the KH31 ramjet supersonic missile and the AS-20 turbojet subsonic anti-ship missile from Russia to arm its fighters. Apart from ramjet technology, China has successfully developed some supersonic anti-ship missiles that can fly above Mach 1.0 (as most anti-ship missiles currently fly at Mach 0.9). The C-101, also known as FL-2 features a smaller and thinner body of the original SS-N-2 Styx, but it can fly at speeds around Mach 1.7. It can attack targets at 40 km. However, like the much larger C-301, its cruise altitude is also at 50 m and thus prone to interception in comparison to faster SS-N-22 with lower cruise altitude. As a result, both C-101 and C-301 saw very little service. The YJ83 also possesses some supersonic attack capabilities. More modern missiles today are the YJ-12 and YJ-91 (KH-31), the most advanced supersonic missiles China has in service. They entered service around 1999 and have a range of 400 km at a speed of Mach 2.5 and can be launched from both ship and air. They can even attack land. Anti-air missiles China's navy had long lacked an air defense missile system, hence why it has been a major area of weakness. China's SAM development had been seriously jeopardized by the Cultural Revolution, and the break away from the Soviet Union meant that no Soviet assistance in air defense missiles was given. The first naval SAM system was not developed until the late 1960s. This was in the form of the HQ-61 SAM, originally a short-range land based system. The first PLAN ship to be armed with SAM was the Type 053K frigate Jiangdong, launched in 1970. However it took many years for the design to mature and the obsolete system was never ideal for naval operations. The Jiangdong had two twin launchers of the HQ61 SAM. The missile was capable of engaging enemy air targets out to 10 km. The HQ-61 was applied to only a limited degree. The Jiangwei I class of four units, were armed with a sextuple launcher. The weakness, however, was lack of automatic reload systems, so the crew had to manually reload. When China opened up in the late 1970s, it had greater access to Westernized technologies. One vital asset imported was the French Crotale short-ranged SAM. Two systems were initially imported and mounted aboard two Luda class destroyers. The design was subsequently indigenized into the HQ-7. The improved-Luda, Luhu, Luhai, Jiangwei II, and 054 class warships. The launcher is an eight-celled system, with a reload hatch, which has additional missiles below deck. Its engagement range is 10‚Äì12 km and is claimed to be capable of engaging low-flying missiles and aircraft. Although the HQ-7 was a significant step towards PLAN air defense capabilities, the PLAN still fell short of possessing a medium- to long-range missile system that could provide true fleet defense coverage. The purchase of Russian Sovremenny class destroyers meant China obtained the medium-range SA-N-7 SAM and its subsequent improved models. This missile was far more advanced than any Chinese indigenous design. The missile was soon adapted for service on board the PLAN's 052B class destroyer. China sought to import the Russian SA-N-6 long- range SAM system. This was based on the land based S-300 missile, which China had already been operating. The SA-N-6 is a vertical launched system (VLS) with a range of 100 km and performance similar to the US Patriot. Two such systems were negotiated for and not ready for installation until late 2005 (on board the new 051C destroyers). Meanwhile, China had developed the HQ-9 system, believed to have partially borrowed some of the features on both Russian S-300 and US Patriot technology (fire control). This was China's first indigenous long-range high-performance air defense missile. This was installed on the 052C class warships. With VLS missiles finally in service with the PLAN, there has been high optimism to see a short-range VLS weapon that could replace the HQ-7. Contenders for the future short-range SAM of the PLAN include a vertical launched variant of the HQ-7, Russian TOR-M1, Russian SA-N-12, VLS variant of the Chinese LY60N or HQ-61, or a completely new design. Submarine-launched ballistic missiles and land attack rockets JL-1 and JL-2 submarine-launched ballistic missiles. The JL-1 was first test fired in 1982 and first successfully launched from the Xia class SSBN in 1987. The JL-1 is currently carried on board China's sole SSBN, the Xia 092. It has 12 launch tubes. Each JL-1 has a range 2,150 km and a single 250-500 kt nuclear warhead. An improved model is in service with a 2,800 km range and possibly higher accuracy. The JL-2 will be the next generation of Chinese SLBM, similar to early variants of the Trident. With a range of 8000 km and multiple warheads (MIRV), this missile is essentially based on the land based DF-31 ICBM design. This means that the future 094 class SSBN can patrol near Chinese waters and launch missiles that could hit the American mainland. The JL-2 project remains under secret and the status of the 094 is largely unknown. One vessel was reported launched very recently, while the JL-2 missile's development is believed to be in its mature stages. A single Jianghu I (hull 516) was modified very recently. It has its anti-ship missiles replaced with several multiple-rocket launchers. The rockets are of 122 mm caliber, and are based on the Type 89 system, which is itself quite similar to the Soviet BM-21 rocket system. The 122 mm rockets are launched from a stabilized launcher, meaning that even if the ship is affected by wave motion, the launcher itself will be stabilized. The rockets have a range of up to 40 km, and can achieve reasonable accuracy in fire. This installation may be seen as an experiment by the PLAN to make use of older warship designs, by turning them into shore bombardment platforms. Though only one ship is being tested for now, this is a very possible concept for future PLAN conversions of their large number of old Luda's and Jianghu's. Fire support from ships is seen as very important by the PLAN when conducting amphibious operations. Cruise missiles Combat data systems A combat data system (or combat management system, CDS/CMS) is considered a force multiplier and another revolution of military affairs after World War II, because CDS automates C4I system by integrating information gathered by separate ship-borne sensors into a coherent overall picture, and assisting decision making, and thus boosting the war-fighting capability of ships equipped with such system. However, until the 1980s, Chinese naval vessels has yet to be equipped with such systems. The first combat data system for Chinese navy was indigenous, and subsequent systems trace their origin from Italian and French systems purchased. Three western combat data systems were known to be purchased by China, including British Racal Marine Radar CTC-1629, Italian Alenia SADOC 2, and French Thomson-CSF TAVITAC. The following Chinese combat systems have been identified: *Type 673-I/Poseidon-1 *Type 673-II Poseidon-2/ZKJ-I *Poseidon-3/ZKJ-II *Poseidon-4/ZKJ-3 *CCS-1 (For export only) *ZKJ-4 *ZKJ-4A *ZKJ-4AG *ZKJ-4B *ZKJ-4BII *ZKJ-5 *ZKJ-1 *ZKT-1A *ZKT-1B *ZBJ-1 *ZBJ-1A *ZBJ-2 Radars For radars deployed by PLAN, please refer to Chinese naval radars. Sonars Chinese sonar systems were initially based on Soviet supplied system, and during the 1980s, some western sonars were also imported, including Italian DE-1160, French DUBV23/43, SS-12, HS-312 etc. Domestic Chinese sonars includes: ;SJD-1 :H/SJD-1 sonar is an indigenously developed bow mounted sonar, first of its kind in China. Initial proposal of adopting Soviet Tamir-11(MG-11, NATO reporting name Stag Hoof) search light sonar was rejected, because it was not considered adequate enough due to its single beam search capability, which means the low speed of search cycle would easily lose targets. A more capable indigenous Chinese sonar was ordered to be developed, with Mr. Huo Guozheng (ÈúçÂõΩÊ≠£) named as the general designer. The resulting indigenous Chinese domestic sonar was SJD-1 low frequency (LF), high power, large aperture sonar with a cylindrical array (designated as Type 601 sonar array), which was accepted into service after eleven major trials at the sea. Type 601 sonar array of SJD-1 sonar has a diameter of 2 m, height of 1 m and weight of 4 tons, and the range is in excess of 6 nautical miles (nm), more than twice the range of Soviet Tamir/MG-11 search light sonar originally proposed. SJD-1 sonar was jointly developed by 706th Research Institute, 726th & 461th Factories, and it is the first bow mounted sonar adopted by Chinese navy. SJD-1 is frequently confused with its successor SJD-2, more commonly referred as SJD-II, whose design started in the 1970s, but was not completed until the 1980s due to major redesign. SJD-1 sonar was installed on Luda class destroyers and subsequently upgraded to SJD-2 in the 1980s. ;SJD-N :It was discovered that SJD-1 sonar cannot provide accurate locations of targets, and the error was too great to be adequate enough to provide fire solutions to onboard ASW weapons. Therefore, the design of Type 051D incorporated an additional high frequency (HF) active attack sonar designated as SJD-N (with Type 675 sonar transducer array) to provide fire solutions, and this attack sonar was subsequently fitted on all Luda class ships. SJD-N was subsequently upgraded to SJD-4 standards. ;SJD-2 :H/SJD-2 sonar, more commonly known as SJD-II, whose design started in the 1970s, but was not completed until the 1980s due to major redesign, is frequently confused with its successor SJD-1. SJD-2 is part of the effort (the other part being SJD-4) to improve the ASW capability of steam powered Chinese warships by incorporating Italian DE-1164 sonar technology. DE-1164 consists of 2 subsystems using the same electrical cabinet, DE-1160 hull mounted sonar (HMS, with a maximum range around 20 km) and DE-1163 variable depth sonar (VDS, with a maximum range in excess of 50 km). DE-1164 is the first sonar in Chinese service to have integrated the HMS & VDS. ED-1164 was installed on Type 051 destroyer for evaluation. :Trials revealed that the performance of DE-1164 sonar was disappointing, with a huge gap between the actual performance and what was specified in documents. However, this was not due to sonar, but the ship itself. Due to the inherent flaws of an old design, the ship is not an ideal ASW platform for advanced ASW system. The steam propulsion system proved to be the major hindrance preventing DE-1164 reaching its full potential. The noise and vibration generated by the steam boilers simply created too much interference with the sensitive sonar that it could only reach its full potential at very low speed. However, at such low speed, target would easily evade and escape Luda's attempt to attack. Test result led to two attempts to address the issue going in parallel: one of them was to upgrade SJD-1 with foreign technologies, and an addition of an attack sonar SJD-4. SJD-2 is thus an upgrade package for older steam-powered warships. ;SJD-3 :H/SJD-3 sonar is the Chinese development of Soviet Tamir-11(MG-11) search light sonar. SJD-3 hull mounted sonar differs from Soviet MG-11 in that instead of being fixed to the hull like the original MG-11, SJD-3 has a telescoping arm, so when not in use, the sonar is stored in the hull, and when deployed, the sonar is lowered into water several metres below the hull, thus increased detection range by avoiding baffles generated by the hull. ;SJD-4 :H/SJD-4 sonar resulted in the same experience of evaluation Italian DE-1164 sonar, which led to the development of SJD-2, the improvement of SJD-1. SJD-4, in turn, is the corresponding upgrade of SJD-N, utilizing the technologies of DE-1164. ;SJD-5 :H/SJD-5 is the Chinese development of Soviet Tamir/MG-11, with transistors replacing vacuum tubes in the original Soviet MG-11, thus reduced size and weight and increase reliability. SJD-5 sonar has several derivatives, including EH-5, with integrated circuits replacing transistors, which further developed into Echo Type 5, adopting LSIC technology. The latest member is SJD-5A, with VLSIC technology. ;SJD-7 :H/SJD-7 is the Chinese development of Italian DE-1164 sonar, with additional noise cancellation and vibration reduction measures so that it can be used on older steam powered warship, whose steam propulsion system generates much greater noise and vibration than diesel and gas turbine propulsion system. ;SJD-9 :H/SJD-9 is the Chinese development of French DUBV23/43 hull mounted/VDS sonar system, incorporating same additional noise cancellation and vibration reduction measures for installation on steam powered warships. ;ESS-1/2 :ESS-1 sonar and ESS-2 sonar are Chinese VDS and hull mounted sonars (HMS) developed from similar western counterparts. The origin of ESS-1 VDS and ESS-2 hull mounted sonar are subject to debate due to lack of official information, with some sources claim that ESS-2/1 are the Chinese version of DE-1160/1162 HMS/VDS, while others claim that it is the Chinese version of DUBV-23/43 HMS/VDS. Since the Italian and French sonars have similar performance (20 km for HMS, and 50 km for VDS), it is difficult to determine which is which, since official Chinese governmental sources only confirms the 20/50 km ranges for HMS/VDS. ESS-2 sonar has bearing accuracy of 1 degree and like its predecessors SJD-1/2, it has a cylindrical transducer. ;SO-7H :SO-7H sonar is the Chinese version of French DUBA 25 sonar. As with SJD-7/9, SO-7H also incorporates additional vibration and noise reduction measures for upgrading older steam powered warships in Chinese navy. ;SJG-206 :H/SJG-206 is low frequency towed array sonar, the first towed sonar in China. Developed by China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation, it won second place in National Science & Technology Advancement Award in 2003, and it equips many Chinese primary surface combatants. ;TLAS-1 :TLAS-1 sonar is the first Chinese towed array with a range of up to 45 km. This passive low frequency sonar is able to simultaneously tracking 5 targets, with a bearing accuracy of 4 degrees, and it shares the same operator console as ESS-2 HMS. This is a light towed system designed for smaller surface combatants. ;SJG-208 :H/SJG-208 is a towed sonar used by Chinese hydrographic and oceanographic survey ships, entered service in 1997, and its general designer is Mr. Li Qihu (ÊùéÂêØËôé), who is also the general designer of H/SQG-4 and H/SJG-206 sonars, and deputy general designer of H/SQG-207 sonar. ;SQG-4 :H/SQG-4 passive ranging sonar is also known as Type 204 sonar, it can be either used as part of H/SQZ-262 integrated sonar system, or as an independent system. Started in 1987, SQG-4 incorporated western technologies, namely French Thomson-CSF DUUX-5, and it deploys three arrays on each side of the submarine. ;SQZ-262 :H/SQZ-262 sonar is a fully digitized, integrated submarine sonar designed by Acoustic Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Sciences. Three versions of H/SQZ-262 was developed, with SQZ-262A replacing Type 105 sonar on Type 033 class submarine, SQZ-262B replacing Type 603 & 604 sonars on Han class and Xia class nuclear submarine, and SQZ-262C installed on Type 035G Ming class submarine. ;SQG-207 :H/SQG-207 flank array is a flank sonar newly developed by 715th Research Institute, first equipped Chinese nuclear submarine, and then conventional submarines during refits, it is the first flank sonar in China. ;Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) :Chinese synthetic aperture sonar (CSAS) is a SAS developed by a team led by Acoustic Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Sciences, partnered with the 715th Research Institute of China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation. The program first begun in Jul 1997 one of the 863 Programs, and the general designer of CSAS was Chinese academician of sciences Mr. Li Qihu (ÊùéÂêØËôé), also the general designer of H/SQZ-262 sonar. In comparison to imported SHADOWS SASSHADOWS SAS developed by French firm IXBLUE, CSAS has higher resolutions: the model of CSAS that utilizes both the medium and low frequencies has a resolution of 0.1 m,CSAS frequency as opposed to 0.15 m of SHADOWS SAS.SHADOWS Sonar The model of CSAS that utilizes high frequency has a highest resolution to 5 cm x 3.75 cm.CSAS HF ;SAS for AUV :China has also developed a miniature SAS for autonomous underwater vehicles(AUVs). Developed by the Information and Communication Engineering Research Institute of Zhejiang University as part of one of the Project 985 programs,SAS for AUV the general designer of Chinese SAS for AUV is Professor Mr. Xu Wen (ÂæêÊñá) of Zhejiang University. ;XT02WR01 :XT02WR01 sonar is a diver detection sonar (DDS) developed by (Beijing) New Source Yongtai Electro-optics Science and Technologies Development Co. Ltd. (Âåó‰∫¨Êñ∞Ê∫êÊ∞∏Ê≥∞ÂÖâÁîµÁßëÊäÄÂèëÂ±ïÊúâÈôêË¥£‰ªªÂÖ¨Âè∏) in Beijing. The system can cover up to 150 hectares of area, with an effective range against a diver at 400 to 700 m (w/ errors of 0.5 m in distance, 15 m in bearing). The size of the system (wet end) is very compact, weight less than 50 kg, with a diameter of 0.5 m and a height of 0.65 m. The wet end only need 200 W of power, same as an ordinary household television, with 220 V power source. The wet end of XT02WR01 sonar can be deployed in a depth up to 40 m deep and can operate in sea state 4 continuously for 3 years, and the entire system can be fully autonomous, operating without any human intervention. The dry end of XT02WR01 sonar system has numerous options based on customer demands, linked to the wet end via waterproof fiber-optics cables. ;Tronka :Tronka sonar is a DDS jointly developed by Ukraine and China. The systems weigh 415 kg (115 kg for wet end, 300 for dry end), and can be deployed in a depth up to 20 m. The effective range is 0.5 km, with an accuracy of 1.5% in range, 2 degrees in azimuth. The height of the wet end is 1.5 m, and the service life of the system is 10 years. ;Underwater Security System :Underwater Security System (USS) is an indigenous Chinese nonlethal diver repellant system developed domestically by a joint team of Institute of Acoustics (‰∏≠ÁßëÈô¢Â£∞Â≠¶ÊâÄ) of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Shanghai Ship & Shipping Research Institute (‰∏äÊµ∑ËàπËà∂ËøêËæìÁßëÂ≠¶Á†îÁ©∂ÊâÄ) of China Shipping Group, and Xi‚Äôan (Research) Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics (Ë•øÂÆâÂÖâÂ≠¶Á≤æÂØÜÊú∫Ê¢∞Á†îÁ©∂ÊâÄ) of CAS. The general designer of USS is Mr.Xu Feng (ËÆ∏Êû´, Jun 1969 -). The detection subsystem of USS consists of both the stationary and mobile sonars. USS has been first deployed in 2008 Olympic games in Chinese port cities hosting water sports, and has since been adopted subsequently by Chinese law enforcement, para-military and military establishments. ;Harbor Underwater Frogmen Detection SystemHarbor Underwater Frogmen Detection System :Harbor Underwater Frogmen Detection System (HUFDS) is a DDS system actively marketed in China by its developer, Beijing Time Frequency Technology Co., Ltd (Âåó‰∫¨Ê≥∞ÂØåÂù§ÁßëÊäÄÊúâÈôêÂÖ¨Âè∏) in Beijing. ;SGP :SGP side scan sonar (SSS) is a family of SSS developed by South China University of Technology led by the general designer Mr. Lin Zhenbiao (ÊûóÊåØÈï≥), and a total of 3 generations of SGP SSS has been developed since program first begun in 1971, including SGP-I/II/III (SGP-1/2/3), with SGP-3 being successfully used in mine detection. The predecessor of SGP-3, the SGP-1 SSS works at two frequencies, 160-190 kHz and 25-30 kHz. ;CS-1 :CS-1 is a side scan sonar developed by Institute of Acoustics (‰∏≠ÁßëÈô¢Â£∞Â≠¶ÊâÄ) of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). CS-1 system consists of computer-based sonar processor, the sonar receiver board, data acquisition board, extended I/O interface board, thermal line scan recorder, tow-fish, tow cable and winch etc. CS-1 is deployed for survey missions. ;Portable SSS :Portable side scan sonar is developed by Institute of Acoustics (‰∏≠ÁßëÈô¢Â£∞Â≠¶ÊâÄ) of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), based on experience gained from CS-1 SSS developed by the same team. Portable SSS is primarily designed as a rapid deployment system that can be readily installed on surface platform, so that it would complement larger systems such as CS-1 which required more dedicated platform. The maximum range is 200 meter, and maximum working depth is 100 meter, highest resolution is 0.5 degree, diameter is 0.1 meter, working frequency is 200 kHz and the total system weight is less than 30 kg.Portable side scan sonar ;HRBSSS :HRBSSS stands for High Resolution Bathymetric Side Scan Sonar, and it is jointly developed by Institute of Acoustics (‰∏≠ÁßëÈô¢Â£∞Â≠¶ÊâÄ) of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and Teledyne RD Instruments (RDI) @ Shanghai. The resolution is 5 cm, working frequency is 150 kHz, and range is 2 x 400 m, maximum working depth is up to 6000 m, and HRBSSS can track multiple targets simultaneously.HRBSSS ;SQX-1 :H/SQX-1 sonar is a communication sonar for underwater communications, with the transducer reportedly designed as Type 063. ;SQC-1 :H/SQC-1 sonar (with transducer designated as Type 604) is a passive sonar installed on first generation Chinese nuclear submarines when they were first launched, and it is no longer in service, replaced by H/SQZ-262B. ;SQZ-3 :H/SQZ-3 sonar (with transducer designated as Type 603) is an active sonar installed on first generation Chinese nuclear submarines when they were first launched, and it is no longer in service, replaced by H/SQZ-262B. ;SQZ-D :H/SQZ-D sonar (with transducer designated as Type 105) is a sonar for older generations of diesel submarines and it is no longer in service, being replaced by H/SQZ-262A. The performance of SQZ is almost identical to the original Soviet sonar it was developed from, except the sector of scan, which is increased by 15 degrees. The volume and weight is also decreased considerably when the original vacuum tubes of the original Soviet sonar (Tamir 5L, NATO reporting name: Perch Gill) was replaced by transistors and integrated circuits. ;SQC-1 :H/SQC-1 reconnaissance sonar is no longer in service when its functions can be performed as part of that of H/SQZ-262 sonar. ;Type 801 :Type 801 sonar is a Chinese development of Soviet MARS-24 sonar for diesel submarines. Type 801 provide azimuth of targets and it is a passive system. The only difference between Type 801 sonar and its predecessor MARS-24 sonar is that there are 24 transducer elements for Type 801 as opposed to 12 in the original MARS 24, so the Chinese sonar had better accuracy. ;SQG-2 :H/SQG-2 sonar is the first domestically developed indigenous Chinese passive ranging sonar, developed to complement Type 801 passive sonar, which could only provide azimuth, but not ranging. SQG-2 is a ranging only sonar that is no longer in service, being replaced by more advanced development. ;SQZ-1 :H/SQZ-1 sonar is an integrated sonar system that integrates Type 801, SQC-1, SQG-2 and SQZ-D sonars so the overall combat effectiveness is improved, in comparison to the old practice of each sonar working separately and info obtained from each individual system must be manually interpreted to form an overall picture. SQZ-1 is no longer in service and has been replaced by SQZ-262 sonar.

Following the war, the ship remained in service with as a patrol and training ship. In 1938, the vessel recommissioned as a gate vessel, re-designated Gate Vessel 1, in service at Halifax, Nova Scotia. On 12 May 1940, the gate vessel was rammed and sunk in a collision with the British battleship . Design and description The RCN's Battle-class trawlers formed part of the Canadian naval response to Admiralty warnings to Canada about the growing German U-boat threat to merchant shipping in the western Atlantic.Tucker, p. 253 Intended to augment anti-submarine patrols off Canada's east coast, these ships were modelled on contemporary British North Sea trawlers, since the standard types of Canadian fishing vessels were considered unsuitable for patrol work.Tucker, pp. 254, 257 Twelve vessels were ordered on 2 February 1917 from two shipyards, Polson Iron Works of Toronto and Canadian Vickers of Montreal.Johnston et al., p. 417 Those vessels built at Polson Iron Works displaced and were long overall with a beam of and a draught of .Macpherson and Barrie, p. 27 They were propelled by a steam-powered triple expansion engine driving one shaft creating giving the vessels a maximum speed of .Maginley and Collin, p. 67 All twelve trawlers were equipped with a QF 12-pounder 12 cwt naval gun mounted forward. This was considered to be the smallest gun that stood a chance of putting a surfaced U-boat out of action, and they also carried a small number of depth charges.Tucker, p. 257 The trawlers were named after battles of the Western Front during the First World War that Canadians had been involved in. They cost between $155,000 and $160,000 per vessel. Service history Ypres was constructed by Polson Iron Works at Toronto and was launched on 16 June 1917.Macpherson and Barrie, p. 31 Intended for use during the 1917 shipping season, the construction of the vessels was delayed by the entry of the United States into the war. With higher wages found south of the border, a shortage of skilled labour developed in the shipyards, coupled with a shortage of construction material.Johnston et al., pp. 481‚Äì484 The trawler was commissioned on 13 November 1917. Ypres sailed to Halifax following her commissioning for defence of the Atlantic coast of Canada.Johnston et al., p. 484 For the defence of shipping in Canadian waters in 1918, the entire Battle class was assigned to work out of Sydney, Nova Scotia.Johnston et al., p. 543 The ship remained in Canadian service following the end of the war until being paid off in 1920. After being recommissioned on 1 May 1923 as a training ship on the east coast, having been re-designated a minesweeper in 1922.Johnston et al., pp. 800‚Äì801, 891 With sister ship , Ypres trained with the destroyers on the east coast until November 1932 she was again paid off and was placed in reserve.Johnston et al., pp. 848, 940 Refitted as a gate vessel in 1938 and recommissioned, Ypres, designated Gate Vessel 1, formed part of the Halifax boom defences until 12 May 1940, when she was rammed and sunk by the British battleship Revenge. =Sinking= HMS Revenge underway at sea The battleship was departing to escort two troop transports sailing for the United Kingdom when a request was made for the boom to be opened for her at 1830. Revenge began making her way towards the gate, which opened at 1826. However, before arriving at the gate, the battleship stopped inside the harbour, closer to the gate. The two troop transports had not joined up with the battleship on time and the officer in charge of gate operations did not inform the gate vessels of the change in departure time. When the ships finally did sail, the gate vessels had little time to get the gate open fully. Gate Vessel 1 reported the gate being open at 2055 and at 2056, Revenge rammed the gate vessel, rolling the trawler almost onto her side and flooding Gate Vessel 1 through her upper deck openings. The trawler, attached to the boom, bounced off the side of the battleship, which dragged the trawler and boom for roughly before the battleship came to a halt. Gate Vessel 1 was abandoned as the ship settled onto the boom and sank at roughly 2125.Darlington and Mckee, pp. 15‚Äì17 There was no loss of life in the collision, with Revenge collecting thirteen members of the crew and Gate Vessel 2 (sister Festubert) collecting five more sailors, one of them a member of Revenges crew who had jumped overboard to save a Canadian. Revenge and her convoy sailed once ascertaining that there had been no deaths. Another Battle- class trawler, , assumed Ypres position as Gate Vessel 1. After this incident, the crews of other gate vessels would pretend to make elaborate preparations for a collision every time Revenge visited Halifax.

Specifically for truck scales used to weigh heavy trucks, light trucks, or other commercial vehicles. The basic concept of truck scale software is to provide the end user with a means of collecting and organizing weighment information. Developers The truck scale industry is not a highly vertical niche market as one might expect. With consumers ranging from single-site low transaction \\"mom and pop shops\\" to multi-national heavy volume corporations; the various Truck Scale Software development companies have ample opportunity to differentiate by targeting the very different needs of the specific consumer types. The basic concept of Truck Scale Software is to provide the end user with a means of collecting and organizing weighment information. Vendors Before the software industry found the Truck Scale niche (in fact before the software industry was even born) scale users would either have to come up with their own customized methods for tracking data, or require that the scale vendor provide one as part of the weighing system. This led to scale vendors needing to be able to provide data collection and management solutions in order to compete. Today, scale vendors are still offering simple (usually quite limited) solutions with systems, sometimes in direct competition with the software developers who are creating much more powerful data collection packages and dynamic user-friendly interfaces. Many of the larger scale vendors however, have started referring to certain Truck Scale Software packages or directly reselling them (for turn-key solutions). Sometimes, truck scale software is part of a much larger software (and is then sometimes referred to as a weighbridge). Many targeted ERPs for industries like quarry/mining/agriculture contain interface module for weighbridges. Some truck scale manufacturers develop and sell their own software for weigh system interfacing and data collection. Legal Many software suppliers and small businesses believe they can simply produce software and use it for capturing weighing transactions, within the EU weighbridge software (Truck Software) is subject to legislation and a useful guide for developers exists and is published by WELMEC. Users Within the consumer sector of the truck scale industry are several subcategories of end user. The consumers range from the single-scale users to multi-national corporations with hundreds or even thousands of scale sites, some of them totally unmanned running unmanned weighbridge software. In many cases each companies requirement is unique to the point where a \\"canned package\\" is almost out of the question. The market is highly service-oriented, with any final solution being somewhat custom tailored to the end user's needs. It is not uncommon for a software package to have an obscure feature only because one particular customer \\"had to have it and was willing to pay for it\\".

Located at the intersection of 67th Avenue and Queens Boulevard in Forest Hills, Queens, it is served by the M train on weekdays, the R train at all times except nights, and the E train at night.  History  The Queens Boulevard Line was one of the first lines built by the city- owned Independent Subway System (IND), and stretches between the IND Eighth Avenue Line in Manhattan and 179th Street and Hillside Avenue in Jamaica, Queens. The Queens Boulevard Line was in part financed by a Public Works Administration (PWA) loan and grant of $25,000,000. On December 31, 1936, the IND Queens Boulevard Line was extended by eight stops, and , from its previous terminus at Roosevelt Avenue to Union Turnpike, and the Grand Avenue station opened as part of this extension. On February 5, 1962, the 67th Drive entrance to the station and a change booth opened. The entrance included three low turnstiles and two high exit turnstiles. This entrance has been built along with the rest of the station, but had not been opened until this point because the station's ridership had not warranted it. Under the 2015‚Äì2019 Metropolitan Transportation Authority Capital Program, the station, along with thirty other New York City Subway stations, was scheduled to undergo a complete overhaul. This station would have been entirely closed for up to 6 months. Updates would have included cellular service, Wi-Fi, charging stations, improved signage, and improved station lighting. However, these renovations are being deferred until the 2020-2024 Capital Program due to a lack of funding.  Station layout  Easternmost stair The station has four tracks and two side platforms.

The other was Khazraj, and the two, constituted the Ansar (\\"helpers [of Muhammad]\\") after the Hijra.. Aws and Khazraj are descendants of the Arab Azd tribe and were known as Ban≈´ Qayla ( ) in pre-Islamic era. Etymology The word al-Aws means \\"the gift\\", probably a contraction for Aws ManƒÅt (, \\"the gift of ManƒÅt\\"). The name was changed in Islamic times to Aws AllƒÅh (). Early history About AD 300. during the emigration of KahlƒÅn from Yemen prior to the Great Flood of Mar'ib Dam, Tha ªlaba bin  ªAmr, grand father of al-Aws, separated from his tribe and settled in Yathrib (Medina),. which was then controlled by Jewish clans, and the Banu Qayla were subordinate to the Jews for some time, until MƒÅlik bin  ªAjlƒÅn of Khazraj asserts independence of the Jews so Aws and Khazraj obtained a share of palm trees and strongholds. Thus, about the 5th century, the Banu Qayla took control of Yathrib,. and Jews retired into the background for about a century. During the period before the Hijra, Abu Qays al-Aslat of the clan of WƒÅ ºil, the leader of Aws, gave away the leadership to ·∏§u·∏çayr bin SimƒÅk of  ªAbd al-Ashhal. After a serious defeat,  ªAbd al-Ashhal and ·∫íafar were withdrawn from Yathrib. The opposing leader,  ªAmr bin Nu ªmƒÅn, of the Khazrajite clan of BayƒÅ·∏ça, drove the Jewish tribes of Banu Qurayza and Banu Nadir into alliance of the two. Nomads of Muzayna joined them too. Most of the Khazraj except  ªAbd AllƒÅh bin Ubayy and another Khazraj leader,. as well as the Jewish tribe Ban≈´ QaynuqƒÅ ª and the nomadic Juhayna and Ashja ª, supported ‚ÄòAmr bin Nu‚ÄòmƒÅn. The Awsite clan of ·∏§ƒÅritha remained neutral. Then, in about 617, the Battle of Bu ªƒÅth began: the Aws forced back at first but finally defeated their opponents. The leaders of both sides were killed. Shi'a sources say they were Jews,The Message But a Jewish source says that they and the Banu Khazraj were Arab tribes from Yemen who came to Medina in the fourth century. The Jewish source says that the two tribes took the power of Medina from the Jews in the 5th century by \\"calling in outside assistance and treacherously massacring at a banquet\\". A Shi'a source says that they had been fighting for 120 years and were sworn enemies. The Jewish source states that they went to war against each other in the Battle of Bu'ath a few years before the Islamic prophet Muhammad migrated to Medina. There were many Jewish tribes in Medina: Banu Nadir, Banu Qurayza, Banu Qaynuqa and many others. During the battle, the Banu Nadir and the Banu Qurayza fought with the Banu Aus, and the Banu Qaynuqa were allied with the Banu Khazraj. The latter were defeated after a long and desperate battle. Hijrah Muhammad came to Medina as a mediator, invited to resolve the feud between the Banu Aws and the Banu Khazraj. He ultimately did so by absorbing both factions into his Muslim community and forbidding bloodshed among Muslims. The Banu Aus were included in the Constitution of Medina as allies to the Muslims, \\"one nation/community with the Believers\\".http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Medina Then, Banu Aus and others became known as the Ansar. Banu Qurayza The Banu Qurayza were a Jewish tribe who lived in Medina. The tribe's men, apart from a few who converted to Islam, were sentenced to death in 627 in retaliation for Banu Qurayza treachery and subversion in aiding the Meccan pagan enemies who had launched a ferocious attack on Madinah, in order to eliminate the Muslims and their allies during the Battle of the Trench. Since the Banu Qurayza had been an ally of the Banu Aus during the Battle of Bu'ath, they choose Sa'ad ibn Mua'dh, the chief of the Banu Aus as their judge. He, in accordance with the punishment typically meted out by the Jews themselves in cases of treachery, condemned the men to death and the women and children to slavery. Sa'ad ibn Mua'dh himself died shortly after the event from injuries that he had received during the Battle of the Trench.

History  The Queens Boulevard Line was one of the first lines built by the city-owned Independent Subway System (IND), and stretches between the IND Eighth Avenue Line in Manhattan and 179th Street and Hillside Avenue in Jamaica, Queens. The Queens Boulevard Line was in part financed by a Public Works Administration (PWA) loan and grant of $25 million. On December 31, 1936, the IND Queens Boulevard Line was extended by eight stops, and , from its previous terminus at Roosevelt Avenue to Union Turnpike, and the 63rd Drive station opened as part of this extension.  Station layout  Station name tablet Both platforms have a medium Sky Blue trim line with a black border and small \\"63RD DRIVE\\" signs below them in white lettering on a black border. The name tablets read \\"63RD DRIVE\\" in white sans serif font on a black border and identical blue trim. Above some of these tablets are modern signs reading \\"Rego Park\\".

The station's I-beam columns are all painted Slate Blue with alternating ones on the platforms having the standard black station name plate in white lettering. This station has an upper level mezzanine that is about 1/3rd the length of the platforms. The mezzanine is split into three sections by a wall on the southbound side and a chain link fence on the northbound side. Numerous staircases from each platform go up to their respective outer section of the mezzanine. A small turnstile bank on the southbound side and exit-only turnstiles on the northbound side lead to the main fare control area. =Exits= Towards the northwest end of the mezzanine, a single extra- wide staircase from each platform goes up to a crossover, where a turnstile bank leads to the main fare control area. There is a token booth and two street stairs, one to the northwest corner of 63rd Drive and Queens Boulevard and the other to the south side of Queens Boulevard near this intersection. On the southeast side of the mezzanine, high entry-exit turnstiles from either outer section lead to an un-staffed fare control area, where one street stair goes up to the northwest corner of 64th Avenue and Queens Boulevard while the other goes up to the south side of Queens Boulevard near the intersection with 64th Road. The mezzanine has mosaic directional signs in white lettering on a teal border. The center section connects the two fare control areas, but provides no crossover. On the extreme northwest (railroad south) end of the platforms, high turnstiles lead to a single staircase that goes up to either western corners of 63rd Road and Queens Boulevard, the northwest one for the Manhattan-bound platform and the southwest one for the Forest Hills-bound platform.  Unfinished Rockaway spur  East of this station, there is an unfinished signal tower on the Jamaica-bound (railroad north) platform and a bellmouth that diverges to the south from the local track. Another tunnel from the Manhattan-bound local track diverges north, then curves south under the Queens Boulevard Line to join the other bellmouth. These were provisions for a planned expansion in the 1930s that would have connected with the IND Rockaway Line (formerly a Long Island Rail Road branch) towards Howard Beach, JFK Airport, and the Rockaways. This spur would have run down 66th Avenue before joining the Rockaway Line at its former junction with the LIRR Main Line. In January 2013, a petition was started on change.org to make use of the bellmouths to connect the station to the currently unused portion of the Rockaway Line.

Hypothesis of Ergotism and the Salem Witch Trials In the April 2, 1976, weekly issue of Science magazine, Caporael debuted a hypothesis that the accusations of witchcraft in Salem, Massachusetts, in 1692 could have been caused by ergotism. A fungus that grows on grains of rye, ergot contains a toxin which resembles LSD, and which can remain toxic in bread baked with flour tainted by it. Her evidence to support this theory includes historic weather reports and other growing conditions that foster the growth of this fungus, and the reported symptoms of several accusers, including hallucinations and crawling sensations in skin, which appear to match symptoms of ergot poisoning.Caporael, Linnda. 1976. \\"Ergotism: The Satan Loosed in Salem?\\".

Science. 194, no. 4272: 1390-1394. In 1982, historian, Mary Matossian, defended Caporael by restating that the weather conditions were prime for growing ergot and that the symptoms of ergot matched the symptoms of the victims.Matossian, M K. 1982. \\"Ergot and the Salem Witchcraft Affair\\". American Scientist. 70, no. 4:355. A year later, Nicholas Spanos challenged Matossian's defense of Caporael, defending his original rebuttal, stating that her argument was \\"irrelevant to the ergot hypothesis, incorrect, and presented in a highly misleading manner.\\"Spanos, Nicholas. 1983. \\"Ergotism and the Salem Witch Panic: A Critical Analysis and an Alternative Conceptualization\\".

In a ten- season stint with the club he made 289 appearances, becoming first-choice keeper in the 1999‚Äì2000 season, the first of two seasons in which he did not miss a league match. While at Chester he made seven appearances for the England National Game XI semi-professional side. He suffered an injury in training in December 2003 that sidelined him for the remainder of the 2003‚Äì04 season, as Chester ended the season as Football Conference champions. He enjoyed a testimonial match against former players in May 2004 and returned to the side at the start of the next season, but was deemed surplus to requirements in May 2005 and dropped back into the Conference for a season- long loan with Hereford United. Brown was the first-choice keeper for Hereford in Conference matches (but was not allowed by Chester to play in cup games) and was an integral part of the best defence in the Conference that season, conceding just 30 goals. He became a fans' favourite, earning the nickname 'Superman'. In the 2006 Conference play-off final with just a few minutes to go in extra time, Brown sustained a head injury in a collision. With all three substitutions made it looked for a moment as if he would be unable to continue, but after several minutes he recovered and even made a good save in the dying minutes to keep Hereford 3‚Äì2 up. Hereford went on to win the match and promotion to the Football League, and Brown signed for Hereford permanently soon afterwards. Brown was first-choice keeper at Edgar Street in Hereford's first two seasons back in the Football League, missing just 9 league matches out of a possible 92. The 2007‚Äì08 season saw him keep 17 clean sheets and concede 41 goals in the league, as Hereford gained promotion to League One. He kept a further four clean sheets in the FA Cup, most notably in the victory over Leeds United at Elland Road. This match was also his 100th competitive appearance for the club.

Biography Some of McFee's early and non-Doobie Brothers work includes playing pedal steel guitar on Van Morrison's Tupelo Honey and Saint Dominic's Preview albums, and recording with many other artists, including Steve Miller on his Fly Like An Eagle album, the Grateful Dead on their From the Mars Hotel album, and Boz Scaggs, Emmylou Harris, Link Wray, Rick James, Janis Ian, Ricky Skaggs, The Brothers Four, Nick Lowe, Wanda Jackson, Bill Wyman of the Rolling Stones, Crystal Gayle, Mike Bloomfield, John Michael Montgomery, the Beach Boys, Norton Buffalo, Twiggy, Eikichi Yazawa, Chicago, and The Kendalls. McFee played for a number of years with Huey Lewis in the group Clover and also played on Huey Lewis and the News' Sports and Hard at Play albums. McFee also played with Glen Campbell, for his Meet Glen Campbell live video performance. McFee has played on a number of Elvis Costello's albums, beginning with all the lead and pedal steel guitar work on My Aim is True; he played lead guitar on \\"Alison\\". He has also continued to perform live with Costello periodically through the years. John McFee, Big Sur, California, 2017, wearing traditional Scottish garb In early 1979, McFee joined the Doobie Brothers, replacing departing guitarist Jeff Baxter. McFee was first featured on the Doobies' ninth studio album One Step Closer, which achieved RIAA platinum album status. Although he did not sing lead vocals on the song, he co-wrote the title track with Doobies drummer Keith Knudsen and Carlene Carter, as well as writing the Grammy-nominated instrumental \\"South Bay Strut\\" with co-drummer Chet McCracken. The album also reunited McFee with Doobies producer Ted Templeman, McFee having played on Templeman's first hit record as a producer (Van Morrison's \\"Wild Night\\" from the Tupelo Honey album). After the Doobie Brothers disbanded in late 1982, McFee and Knudsen formed the country-rock group Southern Pacific, which also included ex-Creedence Clearwater Revival bassist Stu Cook and former Pablo Cruise vocalist David Jenkins. The group achieved a high level of success in the national country charts, starting with their first single reaching the top ten - a duet with Emmylou Harris on the Tom Petty composition \\"Thing About You\\", and going on to numerous other top ten records, including the number one songs \\"New Shade of Blue\\" and \\"Honey I Dare You\\", both of which McFee wrote. Southern Pacific was named New Country Group of the Year when they debuted and have been honored by having their name added to the Country Music Association's Walkway of Stars in Nashville, Tennessee. In 1983, McFee played pedal steel guitar on the song \\"Honky Tonk Blues\\" from Huey Lewis and the News's Sports album, a song which was made famous by country legend Hank Williams Sr. In 1989, Southern Pacific had two songs - \\"Reno Bound\\" and \\"Any Way The Wind Blows\\" - appear in the Clint Eastwood film Pink Cadillac. McFee co-wrote both of the songs. The songs reached the top five on the country charts, and McFee can be heard on lead vocals on both tracks in the movie. Though McFee and Knudsen were committed to Southern Pacific, they co-wrote the song \\"Time Is Here And Gone\\" on the Doobies' 1989 reunion album Cycles with late Doobies percussionist Bobby LaKind. McFee has received numerous BMI awards as a songwriter. In 1990 Southern Pacific played a concert on \\"On Stage\\", McFee can be heard singing lead vocals on \\"Any Way The Wind Blows\\" and \\"I Go To Pieces\\". By 1993, Southern Pacific had disbanded and both men had rejoined the Doobie Brothers. McFee and Knudsen contributed to 2000's Sibling Rivalry, on which McFee sings the lead vocal on the song \\"Angels of Madness\\", of which he was a co-writer, and McFee also co-wrote \\"Five Corners\\" with Patrick Simmons. In 2007, McFee assumed a role onstage as a relief lead vocalist for Tom Johnston because of Johnston's throat ailment. In 1995, McFee produced an album by Moby Grape founding member Peter Lewis. Moby Grape was a major influence on the Doobie Brothers, as well as on many other bands including Led Zeppelin and McFee's former group Clover. The collaboration of McFee (who, besides producing and engineering, contributed background vocals, guitars, violin, harmonica, mandolin, and pedal steel) and Lewis resulted in the album Peter Lewis, released by the German record label Taxim. Also making appearances on the album were former Eagle Randy Meisner, Creedence Clearwater Revival's Stu Cook, Doobie Brothers drummer Keith Knudsen, and Cornelius Bumpus (formerly with the Doobie Brothers and Steely Dan). The album received a rarely seen five star review from Rolling Stone magazine. McFee's long-term partnership with Knudsen ended with Knudsen's death from pneumonia in 2005. In 2007, McFee produced and engineered Carlene Carter's album Stronger, playing almost all the instruments himself. In 2010, he produced and engineered Hawaiianized by singer Pamela Polland. McFee also contributed on 8 string tenor ukulele, slack key guitar, acoustic and electric Hawaiian steel guitars, nylon string guitar, acoustic bass, keyboards, percussion, vocal arrangements, and background vocals for this project. Also in 2010, the Doobie Brothers released World Gone Crazy, on which McFee contributed as recording engineer, as well as playing acoustic guitars, banjo, slide guitar, mandolin, percussion, violin, drums, electric guitars, vocals, and resonator guitars. The New York Post suggested that this album should be \\"Album of the Year\\", saying \\"Now they're back on track, with a smokin' mix of roadhouse boogies, classic rock and country.\\"[3] In 2011, McFee played acoustic and electric guitars, pedal steel, banjo, Dobro, mandolin, and slide guitar on French singer/songwriter Hugues Aufray's project, Troubador Since 1948. Aufray is widely known as a compatriot of Bob Dylan since the folk era, having translated many of Dylan's songs into French. He also wrote and popularized the classic ballad \\"C√©line\\", which inspired Celine Dion's parents to choose this name for their daughter. In 2014, McFee played violin on the band Chicago's single release, \\"Naked In The Garden Of Allah\\". Also in 2014, the John Cowan album Sixty was released, produced by McFee. John Cowan was the lead vocalist and bass guitarist for the legendary progressive bluegrass group New Grass Revival, and in recent years has been touring and recording with the Doobie Brothers. The album \\"Sixty\\" features guest appearances by Alison Krauss, Leon Russell, Ray Benson, Chris Hillman, Rodney Crowell, Bonnie Bramlett, Jim Messina, Alison Brown, Sam Bush, John Jorgenson, Viktor Krauss, Bernie Leadon, Huey Lewis, Jay Dee Maness (Buck Owens and the Buckaroos), Josh Williams (Rhonda Vincent and the Rage), and others. On this project McFee also plays acoustic and electric guitars, pedal steel, Dobro, mandolin, violin, and other instruments as well as singing background vocals. Sixty was listed as one of the top Americana albums of 2014, and has been hailed as John Cowan's \\"masterpiece\\" album. 2014 also saw the release of the Doobie Brothers album Southbound, a Nashville-based project which features high-profile country artists collaborating with the Doobie Brothers on historic Doobie Brothers songs. Examples would be Blake Shelton performing \\"Listen To The Music\\" (with Hunter Hayes on guitar), Zac Brown Band doing \\"Black Water‚Äù, Toby Keith singing \\"Long Train Running\\" (with Huey Lewis on harmonica), Chris Young performing \\"China Grove\\", Brad Paisley doing \\"Rocking Down The Highway\\". On this project McFee can be heard on banjo, slide resonator guitar, pedal steel, violin, autoharp, and electric and acoustic guitars, as well as background vocals. This project also saw Michael McDonald reunited with his fellow Doobie Brothers. In 2015 McFee teamed up with John Jorgenson (Desert Rose Band, Hellecasters, Elton John) to co-produce singer-songwriter Lewis Storey for the project Storey Road. Lewis Storey was nominated for the Horizon Award (Best New Artist) by the Academy of Country Music Awards in 1988 and has won several Songwriters Guild of America awards. The year 2016 involved extensive touring with the Doobie Brothers, co-headlining with the group Journey, and with Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee Dave Mason on the bill as well. McFee, a long time admirer of Mason, was often seen sitting in with Mason and his band, particularly on \\"Dear Mr. Fantasy\\", \\"Feelin' Alright\\", and \\"All Along The Watchtower\\". McFee was also involved with the artist Jeremiah Richey, on the recording project Northridge, on which McFee played electric guitar, pedal steel guitar, violin, Dobro, among other instruments, and was a co-writer of the song \\"Pretty Girl\\" produced by Rob Arthur, with whom a connection was formed when the Doobie Brothers toured with Peter Frampton - Rob Arthur playing keyboards with Frampton. Also in 2016, McFee played on Timothy B. Schmit's solo project Leap Of Faith, playing violin on the first single from the recording, \\"Red Dirt Road\\". Although McFee had performed in concert with Schmit on numerous occasions, this project was the first time the two had worked together on a studio recording project. McFee also toured with Schmit in January 2017, as well as performing again on tour dates in November and December 2017.

He came to York Factory and almost immediately was transferred to Fort Severn. There, he and Andrew Graham designed a comprehensive plan listing long term requirements for the inland posts that the company proposed to establish. While at Fort Severn in 1774 Umfreville assisted Samuel Hearne with the requirements for a proposed post at Cumberland House, Saskatchewan. In 1775, Umfreville was transferred back to York Factory where he became second in command until 1782 when the fort was captured by the French led by Jean-Fran√ßois de Galaup. The personnel and the staff of the fort were sent back to France as prisoners. The Treaty of Paris in 1783 freed Umfreville and he arrived in London. Disputes between him and the HBC ended his tenure there and he left for Quebec. By May 1784 he was employed by the North West Company and was searching for an alternate route from Lake Superior to Lake Winnipeg. Although Umfreville succeeded, the Nor‚ÄôWesters continued to use the route via the Grand Portage since the Americans were not enforcing their rights under the treaty of Paris. In 1784, Umfreville was in Saskatchewan at a fort near Frenchman Butte and, although in the employ of the NWC, advising the HBC to pursue inland forts such as those the Nor‚ÄôWesters were operating out of Fort Kaministiquia. In 1788 he quit the NWC and tried to re-sign with the Hudson's Bay Company. This was unsuccessful and the publishing of his book, The present state of Hudson‚Äôs Bay . . . in 1790 was widely critical of the Company. His whereabouts from this point in time are unknown. The book‚Äôs ill nature reflected the author‚Äôs disappointment over not obtaining a command at the HBC but also did provide knowledge of parts of Canada that was lacking at that point in time.

It was founded in 1785. History The school under the name Trinity Lane (or York) Quaker Girls' School was founded by Yorkshire Quaker, Esther Tuke wife of William Tuke in 1785. This school closed in 1812. In 1831 Esther and William's grandson Samuel Tuke along with William Alexander, Thomas Backhouse and Joseph Rowntree reopened the school at Castlegate House with Hannah Brady as superintendent (1831-42. She was followed by Elizabeth Brady (1842-47), Eliza Stringer (1847-1853), and Rachel Tregelles (1853-1862). Lydia Rous returned from helping in the American Civil War to become head. During her time as Supertendinent informal singing was allowed but music and dancing lessons were not. This restriction allowed for more academic subjects and the school gave greater emphasis to algebra, geometry, Latin and logic than the average girl's school at the time. Rous retired in 1879. In 1856 it moved to its present premises, The Mount. From 1890 to 1902 the Headmistress was Lucy Harrison. Present day The Mount School The current headmistress is Adrienne Richmond. The school motto is Fidelis in Parvo, meaning \\"faithfulness in small things\\". The school is a member of the Girls' Schools Association, the Independent Schools Council. Boarding The Mount offers full boarding, weekly and Flexi boarding. Girls are able to stay for one night a week up to every night of the term. There are many boarding activities and traditions upheld by the boarding department including the Christmas 'Carols on the Stairs' and 'Tea Party with the Elderly'. Traditions The Mount School has many long standing traditions throughout the school year. These range from 'Games in the Dark' at Bonfire Night, where Year 11 girls arrange a treasure hunt style challenge for the younger girls, and some older, to take part in whilst parents arrive at the school for fireworks later in the evening. College girls present three events to the school, one at the end of each term. Firstly the College I Pantomime, then the College II Talent Show and finally the Leavers' Play. The Leavers' Play is presented to the school at Leavers' Supper, usually the final Thursday of the year. The new head girls present the old head girls with flowers and College II present the school with a gift, previous years including an award in memory of a teacher and a digital photo frame to show pictures of student trips. The school holds an end of term meeting both at Christmas and in the summer. Between these meetings is Family Day. This a usually during mid May and is the main fund-raising event of the year. The school body selects two charities to support each year, one based in the UK and one overseas. The students, sometimes staff, speak about potential charities during Morning Meeting before all students vote for which to support. Family Day is an opportunity for every year to run a stall to raise money, whilst music and drama group offer entertainment. Other activity groups run stalls to raise awareness for the work of organisations such as Amnesty International and Eco- Schools Eco Committee, which in 2011 won the Green Flag award for the school. This represents the highest achievement for an eco-friendly school. The Foundation Meeting, or Speech Day, summarises the year and introduces the new head girl team. Awards and Scholarships are presented to students from every year group, including Grade 8 Music and Drama awards. Each leaver in College II writes a few sentences about their time at the Mount and their future plans, these are read out as they receive a necklace of the Mount Rose as a leaving gift. Academics The Mount School has for many years been acknowledged as one of the top independent girls' schools in the United Kingdom. In The Times League Table, the school is ranked 2nd by A-level results in the York area. In the Yorkshire Post, the school was ranked top of an A-level results table for Yorkshire in 2012.John Roberts, \\"Praise as private school tops table on A-levels\\", Yorkshire Post, 25 August 2012 Academically the school maintains traditional values and has developed ‚Äòpillars of excellence‚Äô in several subject areas: sciences, maths, history,\\"Quality Mark Case Study\\" Historical Association music, sports, art, drama and foreign languages. Athletics The sporting facilities are of pitches, an indoor heated swimming pool, a sports hall, and a gymnasium. Girls may opt for activities such as orienteering and fencing. Every year has compulsory P.E. lessons for sports including netball, hockey and swimming in the winter and rounders, tennis and athletics in the summer. College girls are able to choose from a wider variety of sports including lacrosse and using the fitness suite. Every year has a team for hockey, netball, tennis, rounders and swimming. These teams compete with other schools in the city and county. The school also has teams for athletics competitions and cross country races. As well as this the school has two Olympic medalists at disposal. Music The Mount has an entire block dedicated to Music. Annual concerts include recitals for small groups and soloists. There are teachers available for most instruments and an opportunity for students to join a variety of music activities. Ensembles include Senior and Junior Orchestra and Senior and Junior Choir. There is also a Wind group and Swing Band for woodwind and brass instruments. The school's auditioned choir, Singing Group, is invited to sing at several events outside the school including events held at York Minster. Drama Drama is an active part in school life as there is usually a whole school play and a College Play every year. Girls are encouraged to be an active part of all roles for these plays including backstage and lighting, front of house and of course the acting itself. The College play is yet another tradition at The Mount. Girls from College II select a play of their choice to direct, produce and organise costumes and sets. Usually girls in the senior years are chosen for parts and teacher input is kept to an advisory role. Previous years have performed Alice, The History Boys and Accrington Pals. The Drama department presents 'I See A Voice' every term, enabling the current Drama students, both academic and extra-curricular, to showcase their exam pieces to the students and parents. Peace Studies In 2012, the school became the first in England to introduce the PeaceJam Foundation's Ambassadors programme into the school curriculum, as opposed to as an after school club or extra curricular activity.

The character appears in the series Runaways. They are a Super- Skrull in training, created by author Brian K. Vaughan & artist Adrian Alphona, and debuted in Runaways vol. 2 #7. Although Alphona was the series's artist at the time, artist Takeshi Miyazawa first drew the character on print. Xavin had first appeared to the Runaways, taking on the form of a black male, but changed into a black female just for the sake of Karolina Dean, a lesbian whom they were to marry.Runaways: Volume 2, #8. Marvel Comics. Xavin is often seen as a male, simply to be \\"intimidating\\".Runaways: Volume 2, #25. Marvel Comics. Xavin, often called \\"Xav\\" for short, is known for their obtuse and warlike personality.Runaways: Volume 2, #29. Marvel Comics.Secret Invasion: Runaways/Young Avengers. Marvel Comics. They had originally found it hard to fit in with the Runaways due in part to Xavin's constant gender switching and unfamiliarity with Earth values and norms, though through proving their loyalty to the group, found acceptance.Runaways: Volume 2, #24. Marvel Comics. They are the child of the Skrull Prince De'zean. Xavin was portrayed by Clarissa Thibeaux in the second and third seasons of the Hulu television series Runaways which is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Publication history Xavin first appeared in Runaways vol. 2 #7 and was created by Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona. They are introduced as a Skrull prince, the child of De'zean of the Skrull Royal Family on the planet Tarnax VI and they are meant to marry Karolina in order to bring peace to their two warring, alien species. As member of the Runaways, they appeared in the comicbook Secret Invasion: Runaways/Young Avengers, it involves both the Runaways and Young Avengers teams. In the short lived third volume of the Runaways, they were forced to leave the team and was last seen being taken from Earth in Majesdanian custody. Fictional character biography =History= When Xavin journeys to Earth to find Karolina Dean, they reveal to Karolina that their parents had one more large secret. The Deans had been exiled from their planet Majesdane for criminal activities. They traveled to Earth where they encountered Xavin's father, Prince De'zean of the Skrulls, who was going to rule the planet. The Deans had stopped the destruction but gave the Skrulls the location of another, more valuable planet: Majesdane. In order to prove they weren't lying, they gave Prince De'zean's child their child's hand in marriage. The Deans had believed that Xavin would die in the new Skrull/Majesdanian war. Xavin later arrived on Earth in order to marry her and hopefully stop the fifteen-year war between their races. Xavin encountered Karolina shortly after her romantic advances were rejected by Nico Minoru. Xavin, trying to convince Karolina to be their bride, fought and pursued her, in the form of a human male. Karolina revealed that she is not attracted to men and doesn't want to live a lie, but Xavin altered their form to that of a human woman and persuaded her to leave Earth with the new female version of Xavin. During the wedding ceremony, a fight breaks out between the two races and Xavin and Karolina barely escape before Majesdane is destroyed.Runaways: Volume 2, #17. Marvel Comics. They return to Earth, where they help rescue Molly Hayes from the New Pride. Xavin impersonates Nico and takes a bullet for her, distracting Geoffrey Wilder long enough for Nico to untie Molly and escape.Runaways: Volume 2, #18. Marvel Comics. Xavin survives the attack by shape-shifting their organs out of the way. =Secret Invasion= When the Runaways return from a trip to the past, Xavin learns they are in the most heated phase of the Skrull Invasion. Instead of fighting, they knock out their teammates and attempt a peaceful settlement of the war, reasoning that the Skrulls are \\"religious extremists\\". Their attempts at peace fail, and they're informed that the Runaways are targeted for execution. They urge Nico to take the rest of the team and hide, and in a last-ditch effort to halt the invasion, they flee to search for Hulkling, former Skrull King and enemy of the religious extremist Skrulls' Queen, Veranke.Secret Invasion: Runaways/Young Avengers They find Hulkling injured, targeted for assassination by Veranke herself. By siding with Hulkling, they're branded as a traitor too. = As a fugitive = Weeks later, Xavin better adjusted, refraining from insulting Victor and becoming close to Molly (the only teammate other than Karolina to always refer to Xavin as female). However, Xavin is still more-or- less an outcast to the other members. Like the other Runaways, Xavin is an orphan (they told the group when they first appeared that their parents were dead because of the aliens' war). They also call themself a runaway when they reveal their identity to Geoffry Wilder. Xavin joins the group but has trouble adjusting to their new surroundings and getting along with their new teammates, particularly Victor, whom they often offend with condescending remarks about robots. Although they are aggressive and headstrong, Xavin is motivated to protect their new home by their love for Karolina.Runaways: Volume 2, #19. Marvel Comics. Xavin usually reverts to the male Skrull form when in battle insisting that it adds to a more intimidating persona, despite Karolina thinking that it is sexist, yet still spends some time in male human form as well. However, during their trip to 1907, it was revealed that when they lose control or is under emotional pressure, the female form was the one to which they would revert, something that made Karolina very happy. =Departure= In Runaways's \\"Dead Wrong\\" story arc, a group of surviving Majesdanians arrive to arrest Karolina.Runaways: Volume 3, #2. Marvel Comics. After they repeatedly attack the Runaways, Xavin realizes that the aliens won't stop until they get Karolina. Karolina apparently leaves the group with the Majesdanians, but the Runaways, except Nico, are later shocked to find the real Karolina knocked out. Xavin shapeshifted into Karolina's form and took her place to take all the punishment for their species' war. Kissing Karolina, Xavin whispers their love and departs the group.Runaways: Volume 3, #6. Marvel Comics. Their fate is unknown. Powers and abilities Xavin, being a Skrull, has the Skrull natural ability to shapeshift. Xavin was a Super-Skrull in training, meaning they can manifest the powers of the Fantastic Four: Mr. Fantastic's ability to stretch and contort his body into any shape imaginable, Invisible Woman's power to render herself invisible and the ability to create force fields, the Human Torch's fire-control and flight and the Thing's superhuman strength and resistant rock-like hide. The Super-Skrull K'lrt is one of Xavin's idols.Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways. Marvel Comics. As stated by Xavin, they are still a Super Skrull in training, so they can only use their Fantastic Four abilities one at a time; at one point, when Xavin was bombarded with high frequency sounds, they lost control of their powers and burnt up the Griffith Observatory.Runaways: Volume 2, #19. Marvel Comics. Finally, in vol. 3, #2, they used all their powers at once in anger.Runaways: Volume 3, #2. Marvel Comics. =Personality= Xavin is known for their war- like, rash attitude,Runaways: Volume 2, #20. Marvel Comics. something that irritates the other Runaways, particularly Victor, who they had a strong animosity towards because being an android, Victor would have been hardwired to cook and clean on their planet. Although Xavin often demonstrates a strong, general-type behavior, there are periods when they accidentally show they barely have any more experience than the other Runaways; for example, they once stretched themself from one building to another just to get to the other side instead of simply creating a force-field bridge, only realizing the alternative after it was pointed out to them by Molly.Xavin Reception In 2008, Xavin was named the fourth (out of ten) best Skrull characters in an article published on Marvel's official Web site. Gender identity Due to Xavin often changing through their three main forms, (human female, human male, and true Skrull form) both characters within the series and fansRunaways/Young Avengers #3 question the nature of their gender. As a Skrull, a race of shapeshifters, Xavin stated \\"for us, just changing our gender is no different than changing our hair color\\", implying that Skrulls have fluid gender identities. When asked by Molly about why they don't stay in female form all the time, Xavin replied that it was simply their nature to do so and doesn't see a problem in it,Runaways: Volume 2, #22. Marvel Comics. though it causes Xavin to start questioning their own nature. Although Karolina does truly love Xavin, even so much as to deny Xavin disguised as Nico due to loyalty,Runaways: Volume 2, #23. Marvel Comics. she does become depressed when Nico questions Xavin's true gender. In Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways, Xavin is mostly male, but female briefly. In vol. 3, #1, Xavin is only male, but in vol. 3 #2, Xavin is only female.Runaways: Volume 3, #1. Marvel Comics. Karolina is fixed on the idea that Xavin is female, and that Xavin isn't pretending to be a woman, just learning to be human. During an argument with Karolina, Xavin loses control and changes form into their female form, and Karolina takes that to mean Xavin's true form is a female. However, on his blog, the artist Humberto Ramos notes that he was instructed to draw Xavin taking different genders depending on the situation, even when not plot-necessary.Xavin's true gender on Humberto Ramos' blog  Relationships with other Runaways  Due to their war-like, yet rash attitude, Xavin often irritates the other Runaways. They often believed that Victor was supposed to be hardwired to know everything, being a cyborg. In their first appearance, they called Victor a \\"toy\\". Xavin met Karolina after Karolina suffered rejection from Nico, her crush for some time. When Xavin expressed no concern of changing physical appearance from male to female to please her, Karolina began a relationship. Xavin once took the form of Nico in order to please Karolina, but Karolina rejected them as Nico because they had earned her loyalty and reassured Xavin that she loves them as they are. At times, they still suspect Karolina has lingering feelings over Nico.Runaways: Volume 2, #30. Marvel Comics. Later on, during an argument, Xavin subconsciously reverted to female human form, which both surprised and pleased Karolina, who had earlier expressed some lingering doubts about Xavin's true gender. Besides Victor, Xavin strongly infuriates Nico and often questions Nico's leadership decisions. Xavin grew to respect Nico's leadership telling her how much they've learned much from her.Runaways: Volume 2, #21. Marvel Comics.  In other media  Xavin appears in the second season of Runaways portrayed by Clarissa Thibeaux with other actors and actresses occasionally portraying them. This version is a Xartan, a being with the ability to shapeshift, presenting as numerous people before adopting a female body. They are first named in \\"Last Rites\\" as one of the aliens on Jonah's ship, before it is blown up by Pride. They begin telepathically conversing with Karolina before adopting the appearance of a charitable stranger and briefly interact with her while shopping. Xavin fully reveals themself to Karolina at the end of \\"Earth Angel\\" as her betrothed. They tell Karolina they stowed away on a ship that carried Karolina's biological father, \\"Jonah\\", and his family of exiled Gibborim royal magistrates for the purpose of fulfilling an uncertain prophecy that she believes they are a part of that will unite two worlds and bring peace to the universe. Xavin stays at the hostel where she speaks with Leslie Dean and reveals to her that she is pregnant with Jonah's heir and that he and his family have inhabited other bodies, later revealed to be Stacey Yorkes, Tina Minoru, Victor Stein, and one unknown party (Alex Wilder). They try rescuing Karolina from Victor/Jonah, but they are overpowered. They regroup at the hostel with Leslie, Alex, Molly, and Nico to plan out how they will rescue their friends from Jonah.

Honey Monster Puffs were first launched in 1957, with Jeremy the Bear. They were invented by William Halliday Davies (1919‚Äì2009), production manager at the Quaker Oats mill in Southall. For many years they were made by the Quaker Oats Company, but in 2006 they were sold to Big Bear t/a Honey Monster Foods, based in Leicester. In 2016, food manufacturer Brecks Company took over production of Honey Monster Puffs under licence. Mascot The cereal is known for its Honey Monster mascot, a large, hairy, yellow creature introduced in 1976. In 2014 the product was re-branded to Honey Monster Puffs, and its recipe changed to have 8% less sugar and 20% more honey, so that the total sugar content is now 29% by mass, and the honey content has increased from 3% to 3.6%. Varieties There have been a number of variations on the basic product, during the 1990s and 2000s including: * Banana Puffs * Choco Puffs * Honey Waffles * Spooky Puffs * Honeycomb Puffs * Strawberry Puffs * Snowy Puffs Advertising Sugar Puffs posters can clearly be seen in the 1966 film Daleks ‚Äì Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D.. They helped to finance the film, and in return held a giveaway contest in which the grand prize was a Dalek prop made for the film. The cereal's mascot is the Honey Monster, a large, hairy, yellow humanoid creature who was first seen on TV in 1976 in an advertisement created by John Webster of the advertising agency BMP.Mark Tungate, Adland: A Global History of Advertising, Kogan Page Publishers, London, 2007, p. 92. The advert focused around a nutritional message which was illustrated by the parent and child relationship of actor Henry McGee and the Honey Monster. The monster shouts \\"Tell them about the honey, mummy!\\" to which McGee responds \\"I'm not his mummy!\\". The monster then proceeds to destroy the set. In the late 1980s, \\"Sugar Puffs\\" advertisements featured the slogan \\"You'll Go Monster-Mad For The Honey\\". These advertisements portrayed children trying to get access to a packet of Sugar Puffs with someone or something then preventing them from getting the Sugar Puffs. The children would then cry \\"I Want My Honey!!\\" and they would then turn into Sugar Puffs Honey Monsters and thus get the Sugar Puffs. There were a number of settings for these advertisements. The advertisements themselves were: *\\"Breakfast Time\\": Where a boy tries to reach a packet of Sugar Puffs on a fairly high cupboard. *\\"School History Class\\":Where a class of children turned into the Honey Monster after seeing a Sugar Puffs delivery lorry pull up outside their classroom. *\\"Boyscouts\\": Where three boyscouts turned into the Honey Monster after their tent zipper failed to undo properly. *\\"Fairground\\": Where a girl tried to win a packet of Sugar Puffs at a hoop-throwing stall. *\\"School Tour\\". A futuristic advertisement which shows boys and girls transforming into the Honey Monster after they get shown around a lavish Sugar Puffs factory. *\\"Desert Island\\". A boy is sat at home wanting his \\"honey\\", because he cannot get milk out of the milk glass. He then gets shot out of space and back into the Earth on a Caribbean setting, as the monster. He now has milk. After these advertisements, the Sugar Puffs Honey Monster was then seen in advertisements in which he was depicted playing football and also as a James Bond-style hero. Punk poet John Cooper Clarke also featured in a series of off the wall adverts in the 1990s. An advertisement showing the Honey Monster onstage with Boyzone at Wembley Arena aired in 1996, and was voted #17 in ITV's Best TV Ads Ever 2 list in 2006, sharing the position with the original 1976 advert. Another of the 1996 adverts showed him winning a football match. In 1998, an advert which depicted him as \\"Puff\\" Daddy aired. In 1999, an advert called \\"Monster Men vs Breakin' Boyz\\" aired. A modern style remake of the original 1976 advert aired in 2003. In March 2008, a new campaign was launched with a television advertisement. The spot featured Honey Monster and his housemate sitting at their breakfast table, singing a nonsense song about Sugar Puffs, in the scat style. Finishing with the strapline ‚ÄòFeed the fun‚Äô, the advertisement represented the idea that Honey Monster brings out the child in everyone. The advert was criticised by Julian Barratt and Noel Fielding of the comedy duo The Mighty Boosh, who considered it to be a plagiarisation of the \\"crimping\\" songs in their television series. In August 2008 the Honey Monster featured in a charity video and single by the group Samanda, called \\"Honey Love\\". Another new advert was broadcast for the Honey Waffles cereal variant, returning the Honey Monster to his true self along with his undying love for honey. The ad ends with the tagline (as said by the Honey Monster) \\"Don't tell 'em about the honey, mummy\\", a reference to the Sugar Puffs endline from the 1970s. In popular culture The Honey Monster was used as part of a recurring gag in the film Four Lions when one of the main characters uses an outfit of the character as a disguise in the final act. Paul Calf is frequently seen eating Honey Monster Puffs. In the British science-fiction show Red Dwarf, Dave Lister is fond of Sugar Puff sandwiches. In 2009, as part of Red Nose Day, Honey Monster appeared with many other advertising icons in a self-deprecating sketch called 'The Greatest Minds in Advertising'. As the punchline Honey Monster silences his colleagues by singing a song in falsetto (not his trademark deep voice) exhorting people not to buy advertised products but to give their money to Comic Relief instead. The cereal features in the 2018 Interactive film Black Mirror: Bandersnatch. As a result of Honey Monster appearing in the kit of Newcastle United F.C., sales of Sugar Puffs fell by 20% in the north-east of England, as fans of Newcastle's traditional rivals, Sunderland A.F.C., boycotted the brand.

Biography  Born in Morlaix, Brittany, in a family originating in the region of Quintin and having studied Breton in his youth, Fleuriot passed his university history agr√©gation in 1950. He taught at lyc√©es and coll√®ges in Paris and the surrounding suburbs, as well as at the Prytan√©e National Militaire in La Fl√®che. He entered the Centre national de la recherche scientifique in 1958 and earned his doctorate at the Sorbonne University in 1964, defending a thesis called Le vieux-breton, √©l√©ments d'une grammaire (Old Breton, an Elementary Grammar), along with a complementary thesis, Dictionnaire des gloses en vieux-breton (Dictionary of Old Breton Glosses). In 1966, Fleuriot was named chair of Celtic studies at the University of Rennes 2 ‚Äì Upper Brittany in Rennes, and at the same time as research director at the √âcole Pratique des Hautes √âtudes in Paris. He contributed greatly to the growth of Breton language teaching at the university level. Fleuriot's book Les origines de la Bretagne defended a \\"two wave\\" model of British immigration into Brittany and argued that the legend of King Arthur arose from the life of Romano-British leader Ambrosius Aurelianus, who was known in Gaul as Riothamus. Fleuriot came into conflict with Fran√ßois Falc'hun's claim that Breton was essentially native Gaulish, only influenced by the incoming British language. However, he accepted that Breton had been influenced by surviving local forms of Celtic.Glanville Price, The Celtic Connection, Colin Smythe, 1994, p. 7 Fleuriot died suddenly in Paris in 1987, aged 63, leaving much of his planned research unfinished.

Located under private property at the northeast corner of the intersection of Grand Avenue, Broadway, and Queens Boulevard in the neighborhood of Elmhurst, Queens, it is served by the M train on weekdays, the R train at all times except nights, and the E train at night. The station opened on December 31, 1936 as part of the Independent Subway System's Queens Boulevard Line. The opening of the station brought significant growth to Elmhurst.  History  The Queens Boulevard Line was one of the first built by the city-owned Independent Subway System (IND), and was planned to stretch between the IND Eighth Avenue Line in Manhattan and 178th Street and Hillside Avenue in Jamaica, Queens, with a stop at Grand Avenue.See: Board of Transportation of the City of New York Engineering Department, Proposed Additional Rapid Transit Lines And Proposed Vehicular Tunnel, dated August 23, 1929 The line was first proposed in 1925. Construction of the line was approved by the New York City Board of Estimate on October 4, 1928. The line was constructed using the cut-and-cover tunneling method, and to allow pedestrians to cross, temporary bridges were built over the trenches. The first section of the line opened on August 19, 1933 from the connection to the Eighth Avenue Line at 50th Street to Roosevelt Avenue in Jackson Heights. Later that year, a $23 million loan was approved to finance the remainder of the line, along with other IND lines. The remainder of the line was built by the Public Works Administration. In 1934 and 1935, construction of the extension to Jamaica was suspended for 15 months and was halted by strikes. Construction was further delayed due to a strike in 1935, instigated by electricians opposing wages paid by the General Railway Signal Company.See:  In August 1936, tracks were installed all the way to 178th Street, and the stations to Union Turnpike were completed. On December 31, 1936, the IND Queens Boulevard Line was extended by eight stops, and , from its previous terminus at Roosevelt Avenue to Union Turnpike. In Elmhurst, almost all of the century-old buildings in the heart of the village were destroyed for the construction of the subway. Land was taken on the west side of the Broadway to avoid the demolition of St. James Episcopal Church and the Reformed Church of Newtown. An easement was granted so the line could pass under the old St. James Church building at the southwest corner of Broadway and 51st Avenue. Many nineteenth century residences and the Wandowenock Fire Company buildings had to be torn down. To allow the subway line to curve into Queens Boulevard from Broadway, the northeast corner of the two streets was removed, in addition to some stores. New buildings were built behind a new curb line once the subway was completed, bringing a new face to Elmhurst. The introduction of the subway stimulated local growth in Elmhurst. Commercial buildings and apartment houses replaced existing structures.  Station layout  Entrance at Broadway There are four tracks and two side platforms here. In between the local tracks and the express tracks, there are trackway walls. The station has a full length mezzanine, but as the fare control and booth area are at the center of the mezzanine, crossover is available only at the easternmost staircase. Both platforms have a medium Cerulean Blue tile band with a black border with small \\"GRAND\\" captions in white lettering on a black background beneath them. They also have name tablets reading \\"GRAND AVE.\\" with \\"NEWTOWN\\" shown beneath in white sans serif lettering on a black background and a Cerulean Blue border. Concrete-clad columns painted Cadet blue run along both platforms at regular intervals with alternating ones having the standard black name plates in white lettering. =Exits= Each side has two sets of street stairs. There is a full-time entrance at Justice Avenue and Broadway on the west end, with staircases to either side of Broadway. There are also exits to either southern corner of Queens Boulevard at 54th Avenue (the southeast- corner staircase being outside the First Presbyterian Church of Newtown complex), and another staircase to the northern side of Queens Boulevard at 54th Avenue. High entry/exit turnstiles at both ends of the mezzanine allow people to exit fare control without having to walk down to the middle of the mezzanine. A free crossover between two platforms exists at this location. Originally, there were two fare control areas at each end, which is clear from the presence of two closed staircases at the Manhattan-bound side. The mezzanine narrows to about two-thirds of its width on the southern side of the mezzanine directly to the opposite of the closed staircases. The narrowing of the mezzanine did not allow for staircases on the Queens-bound side in this location like on the Manhattan-bound side. Chain-link fence is used to separate the areas inside and outside fare control. The Manhattan- and Queens- bound paid areas are separated by at this location by the unpaid area, which runs down the center of the mezzanine. In total, this side of the station has four staircases in addition to the two closed ones mentioned, while the other side has five staircases.

Her life and climbing career is illustrated in her biography Fear No Boundary: The Road to Everest and Beyond, written by fellow climber Lincoln Hall and Fear, published in 2005.  Background and early career  Fear was born on 18 March 1963 in St Ives, New South Wales, Australia, she was the middle child in her family, with two brothers Grahame and John. Her parents were Ron and Joan Fear. Her mother Joan died from breast cancer in May 1988, and her father Ron died unexpectedly of a heart attack in June 2002. Fear attended St Ives North Public School in her primary school years where she was the School Captain, and later attended Abbotsleigh (Years 7‚Äì10) where she was the softball captain, and Barker College (Years 11‚Äì12) on Sydney's north where she was a school prefect and the captain of the girl's hockey and cricket teams. While at school she attained the Duke of Edinburgh's Gold Award. Sue was recently (2019) honoured when Barker College, extending their number of 'Houses' to cater for the influx of many more girls in Years 7-9, named one house after her (Fear House). After leaving school after Year 12 in 1980 Fear took an office job with Wilderness Expeditions, an adventure travel company founded by Tim Macartney-Snape. That company was later acquired by World Expeditions, and she moved out of the office and into the field. She became an adventure guide and led cross country ski trips in Australia as well as treks in Africa, South America and Asia. She was recognized as one of the company's senior guides, leading many physically challenging mountaineering expeditions.  Climbing career achievements  Between 1997 and 2006 Fear climbed five of the world's fourteen 8,000 metre peaks. Her climbing career took off in 1997 when she led the first successful ascent by an Australian team of Makalu II (7,680 m) in Nepal. She followed this with ascents of Cho Oyu (8,201 m) in 1998 and Shishapangma (8,046 m) in 2002. In 2003, Fear climbed Everest (8,848 m) from the more difficult Tibetan side on the North Col. She was the first Australian-born woman and the second Australian woman overall to do so. She then successfully summitted Gasherbrum II (8,035 m) in Pakistan the following year (2004). Her final climb was to Manaslu (8,156 m) in 2006, which she successfully summited. Fear died on 28 May 2006, when she fell into a crevasse (approx. 7,800 m) while descending from the summit of Manaslu in Nepal. Manaslu was her fifth climb of a mountain over 8,000 metres. Her body remains on the mountain, honouring an earlier request if she were to die whilst climbing a mountain. A plaque now lies in memory of her just above the town of Bandipur on a small hill facing Manaslu.  Honours and awards  Fear was awarded the Order of Australia Medal (OAM) in 2005 for her work as Ambassador for The Fred Hollows Foundation and for services to mountaineering, which will have an eye clinic named after her in Dhading Besi, Nepal. Fear was also named the 2003 Adventurer of the Year by the Australian Geographic Society. She was an ambassador for the Australian Himalayan Foundation, and also helped raise funds for Australian Nepalese Medical Group.

The standard used by the British National Health Service (NHS) to transmit pathology orders and pathology test results currently uses UN-EDIFACT based messages. PMIP began in the United Kingdom as the PMEP (Pathology Messaging Enabling Project) under the control of the NHS Information Authority and was supported by the Royal College of Pathologists (Dr Rick Jones), the Royal College of GPs (Dr Stephen Pill) and the British Medical Association. PMIP was designed for the transmission of structured pathology orders and their associated results between pathology and primary care systems. Messages are encapsulated in EDIFACT rather than XML as this work had already been done. Originally messages were to be encrypted end-to-end (organisation-to- organisation) using public key infrastructure (PKI). The NHS subsequently moved to an alternative strategy using Data Transfer Service (DTS). Messages are encrypted from the pathology laboratory to the DTS server, and again from the DTS server to the General Practitioner using the PMIP interim messaging cryptographic service. The DTS provides application-to-application messaging within the NHS as well as providing a replacement for the X.400 service. It also provides easier development capability for the system suppliers at each end site. All pathology tests and profiles are coded with Read Codes which had initially been developed by a General Practitioner, James Read, to describe all aspects of healthcare for his own use. These codes were subsequently adopted by the NHS. A subset, known as the Bounded Code List (BCL), was developed specifically for this project. Read Codes have been subsumed into Clinical Terms (CT), which is an enhancement of the American SNOMED (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine) classification scheme. The electronic delivery of test results from clinical laboratories to clinical users is rightly seen as a service that can provide clinical benefit by speeding up diagnostic processes and ensuring accurate and timely delivery of critical clinical information. Such electronic transfers were begun in the UK and Europe in the early 1990s using ad hoc message standards. In the mid-1990s the NHS in the UK took the bold step of making this a universal feature of result delivery to general practice (GPs) and embarked on two linked projects to achieve this. In the first, the Pathology Messaging Enabler Project, standards were defined and infrastructure installed to link 200 laboratory systems to 8,500 GP systems. In the second project, the Pathology Messaging Implementation Project, these standards and the associated software was rolled out. By 2004 more than 35 million results messages were being transmitted each year and in 2007 some 50 million such messages were safely and securely delivered.

Its essential role was discovered by Moritz Pasch in 1882. Statement Two lines (in black) meeting a triangle side and meeting the other sides and The axiom states that,This is taken from the Unger translation of the 10th edition of Hilbert's Foundations of Geometry and is numbered II.4. The fact that segments AC and BC are not both intersected by the line is proved in Supplement I,1, which was written by P. Bernays., the Unger translation. A more modern version of this axiom is as follows: (In case the third side is parallel to our line, we count an \\"intersection at infinity\\" as external.) A more informal version of the axiom is often seen: History Pasch published this axiom in 1882, and showed that Euclid's axioms were incomplete. The axiom was part of Pasch's approach to introducing the concept of order into plane geometry. Equivalences In other treatments of elementary geometry, using different sets of axioms, Pasch's axiom can be proved as a theorem; it is a consequence of the plane separation axiom when that is taken as one of the axioms. Hilbert uses Pasch's axiom in his axiomatic treatment of Euclidean geometry.axiom II.5 in Hilbert's Foundations of Geometry (Townsend translation referenced below), in the authorized English translation of the 10th edition translated by L. Unger (also published by Open Court) it is numbered II.4. There are several differences between these translations. Given the remaining axioms in Hilbert's system, it can be shown that Pasch's axiom is logically equivalent to the plane separation axiom.only Hilbert's axioms I.1,2,3 and II.1,2,3 are needed for this. Proof is given in . Hilbert's use of Pasch's axiom David Hilbert uses Pasch's axiom in his book Foundations of Geometry which provides an axiomatic basis for Euclidean geometry. Depending upon the edition, it is numbered either II.4 or II.5. His statement is given above. In Hilbert's treatment, this axiom appears in the section concerning axioms of order and is referred to as a plane axiom of order. Since he does not phrase the axiom in terms of the sides of a triangle (considered as lines rather than line segments) there is no need to talk about internal and external intersections of the line with the sides of the triangle ABC. Caveats Pasch's axiom is distinct from Pasch's theorem which is a statement about the order of four points on a line. However, in literature there are many instances where Pasch's axiom is referred to as Pasch's theorem. A notable instance of this is . Pasch's axiom should not be confused with the Veblen- Young axiom for projective geometry, which may be stated as: There is no mention of internal and external intersections in the statement of the Veblen- Young axiom which is only concerned with the incidence property of the lines meeting. In projective geometry the concept of betweeness (required to define internal and external) is not valid and all lines meet (so the issue of parallel lines does not arise).

It is one of the diverse bird taxa that are vernacularly called \\"grosbeaks\\", but it is not closely related to the grosbeaks sensu stricto. Many authorities place the species in the genus Carpodacus, but some place it in its own genus, Chaunoproctus. A 2013 genetic analysis found it to be a relatively basal member of the group, more derived than the common rosefinch, but with no close relatives, with an estimated divergence time from other members of the group around 12.5 million years ago. Behaviour Keulemans It was a retiring, although not shy bird, and was usually found singly or in pairs. It fed on fruits and buds which were primarily picked up from the ground or low shrubs; it rarely was observed to perch in trees, being apparently rather phlegmatic and somewhat reluctant to fly. Only one kind of vocalization has been described: a soft, pure and high note, sometimes short, sometimes drawn out; sometimes given singly, sometimes in a short series. Habitat It was found only on Chichi-jima in the Ogasawara Islands. While reports that it was also found on Haha-jima are almost certainly erroneous, it might have occurred on Anijima and Ot≈çtojima. Chichi-jima is the only place, however, where the bird was observed. Several specimens were taken; some 10 remain at present. Contemporary illustrations show considerable differences, especially in males. Whether these are due to seasonal variation or whether several subspecies or even species existed could only be determined by a thorough review of the available material. Extinction Turnaround video of a male specimen, Naturalis Biodiversity Center The Bonin grosbeak was discovered by the Beechey Pacific expedition, which collected two specimens on Chichi-jima in 1827. The following year, Kittlitz took several more specimens, but he only gave the locality \\"Boninsima\\" (=\\"Bonin-shima\\": Ogasawara Islands). Following the report of two shipwrecked sailors, picked up by Beechey, that the island would make a good stopover station for whalers, settlement was begun in 1830. When the Rodgers-Ringgold North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition called at Chichi-jima in 1854, naturalist William Stimpson could not find the birds. What he did find, however, were rats and feral goats, sheep, dogs and cats, in addition to the pigs that were already present in 1828 (and which might have been left there by Beechey to provision future castaways). Just like the Bonin thrush, the Bonin grosbeak probably succumbed soon after 1830 to habitat destruction and predation by the introduced mammals. The collector A. P. Holst was told by settlers on Chichi-jima in 1889 that some birds had persisted on Haha-jima until the early 1880s. However, given that the species was not reported from there neither during the 1853 visit of the first Perry mission to Japan nor in 1854, this seems either erroneous or a misunderstanding for some other island in the Chichi-jima group. The sedentary habits of the Bonin grosbeak make it unlikely that it was present anywhere outside the Chichijima Rett≈ç.

In February 2015 the site was taken offline.  Content  Crime Library contained an extensive collection of crime related articles, which were separated into categories: Serial Killers, Notorious Murders, Criminal Mind, Terrorists & Spies and Gangsters & Outlaws. Each category was then broken down into further subcategories. For example, within Serial Killers were the subcategories Most Notorious, Sexual Predators, Truly Weird & Shocking, Unsolved Cases, Partners in Crime and Killers from History. Crime Library also featured photo galleries. These may have had anywhere from 10 to upwards of 100 slides. Some photo galleries were focused on a specific case, while others were lists of crimes linked by a theme (e.g., \\"Baby for Sale,\\" cases where a person was arrested for allegedly attempting to sell his or her child), or collections of unusual booking photos. High-profile crimes in the United States were prominent on Crime Library, but the site also contained information about historically notorious characters from various countries, including United Kingdom, Australia and France. All articles on Crime Library were written exclusively for Crime Library by dozens of commissioned writers, many of them true-crime authors, including Chuck Hustmyre, Katherine Ramsland, Gary C. King and Anthony Bruno. Crime Library maintained social media features where readers could interact and discuss criminal cases, including a Facebook page, a Twitter account and message boards.

Before this, he was Professor of Human Geography and Dean of the Graduate School at Royal Holloway, University of London. In 1998, he received the prestigious Back Award from the Royal Geographical Society. Early life and education Cosgrove was born and raised in Liverpool, the second eldest of six children. His father, a bank manager and devout Roman Catholic, was very active in his upbringing, sending him to the Jesuit school he had himself attended, St Francis Xavier's College, Liverpool. Geography was a subject Cosgrove loved, but the school had a low opinion of it, and as an A-stream student he was forced to drop it in favour of Latin and Greek (protesting to the headmaster, a priest, his mother was told emphatically \\"geography is a girl's subject\\"). He went up to St Catherine's College, Oxford for his undergraduate studies in Geography, graduating in 1969, then going on to complete an MA in Geography at the University of Toronto. After marrying his first wife in New York, he returned to the University of Oxford to do a doctorate with a \\"head full of new ideas\\", but with little academic support, and left to take a job \\"up the hill\\" as Lecturer at Oxford Polytechnic in 1972. Meanwhile, his thesis on Venetian landscape was submitted for a Bachelor of Letters (BLitt) degree, only to be successfully resubmitted for a Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil) degree on the insistence of its examiner, David Lowenthal, who considered it an outstanding piece of work. Career and later life Cosgrove remained at Oxford Polytechnic until 1980, rising to be Principal Lecturer. He then moved to Loughborough University becoming Reader in 1988, before transferring to Royal Holloway, University of London in 1994 as Professor, ultimately serving as Dean of the Graduate School. He was appointed Alexander von Humboldt Professor of Geography at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2000, remaining a Visiting Professor at Royal Holloway, University of London until his death. Cosgrove was about to become chairman of the Geography department at UCLA, when he was diagnosed with stomach cancer in 2006. He had been named Getty Distinguished Scholar for 2008-9, and had planned to work on Geography and Art in Los Angeles. Cosgrove died of cancer at his home in Los Angeles on 21 March 2008. He was survived by his first wife Isobel, his second wife Carmen, and his son and two daughters. Honours and awards In February 2008, Cosgrove was awarded an honorary doctorate from Tallinn University., having previously been awarded the prestigious Back Award from the Royal Geographical Society in 1988. He delivered the influential Hettner Lectures in 2005.. Following his death, he was widely recognised for his contribution to the field, including an extensive reflection on his career and research in the journal Cultural Geographies.. The Centre for GeoHumanities at Royal Holloway, University of London holds an annual lecture in his honour. Research Cosgrove's research interests evolved from a focus on the meanings of landscape in human and cultural geography, especially in Western Europe since the 15th century, to a broader concern with the role of spatial images and representations in the making and communicating of knowledge. His work included how visual images have been used in history to shape geographical imaginations and in connection between geography as a formal discipline, imaginative expressions of geographical knowledge and experience in the visual arts (including cartography). This research made essential contributions to the development of geography of media and communication. This broad concern was pursued through a series of focussed studies: of landscape transformation, design and images in 16th-century Venice and north Italy, of landscape writings by authors such as John Ruskin, of landscape, space and performance in 20th century Rome, of cosmography in early modern Europe (1450‚Äì1650), and of the history of Western imaginings of the globe and whole earth. He has also written extensively on theory in cultural geography and edited for six years the journal Ecumene (now titled Cultural Geographies) which publishes cross- disciplinary work on environment, culture and meaning. Within his cultural research, Cosgrove differentiated between dominant cultures and alternative cultures. The dominant culture has the most influence in shaping a landscape. Most of what you see, he claimed, is likely to be a product of the dominant culture in a region. However, one is also likely to see evidence of alternative, or subcultures in the landscape. Within the category of alternative culture, Cosgrove differentiated between residual cultures (historic cultures that have disappeared or are in the process of fading away), emergent cultures (those that are just now appearing), and excluded cultures (those that are actively or passively excluded by the dominant culture).

He was the NKVD's most valuable mole inside the Trotskyist organization in Paris during the 1930s and in New York during the 1940s. Childhood in Uman Zborowski was one of four children born into a Jewish family in Uman, near Cherkasy, in 1908. According to the story Zborowski told friends, his conservative parents moved to Poland in 1921 to escape the October Revolution in Russia. While he was a student, Zborowski disobeyed his parents and joined the Polish Communist Party. His political activity led to imprisonment and he fled to Berlin where he was unsuccessful in finding employment. He moved to France and attended the University of Grenoble, studying anthropology and working as a waiter. Early life in Paris In 1933, the penniless Zborowski turned up in Paris with his wife and was recruited as an NKVD agent by the Leningrad √©migr√© Alexander Adler. He provided the NKVD with a written background and revealed that his sister and two brothers lived in the Soviet Union. According to historian John J. Dziak, the NKVD had recruited him into a special group who murdered special enemies of Joseph Stalin. Those assassinated included Ignace Reiss (1937), Andr√©s Nin (1937), and Walter Krivitsky (1941). Members of the group are said to have included Leonid Eitingon, Nikolai Vasilyevich Skoblin, Sergei Efron, and David Alfaro Siqueiros, and perhaps the psychoanalyst Max Eitingon.See also exchange of letters that followed. =Embedding with Lev Sedov= The NKVD took steps to infiltrate him into the Paris organization run by Leon Trotsky's son Lev Sedov. Known as Etienne, Zborowski befriended Sedov's wife, Jeanne Martin, and she recommended him for the position of Sedov's secretary. Because of his obsequious nature and untiring work, and because he was also a Russian speaker in what was mostly a French group, Etienne soon became indispensable to Sedov. He served as a member of the group's Central Committee, read and answered Sedov's mail, edited the Russian language version of the Bulletin of the Opposition, stored part of the Trotsky archive at his home, and served as Sedov's deputy in his absence. All the while Etienne reported on the activity of Trotsky (codename OLD MAN), Sedov (codename SONNY), and the Trotskyists (codename POLECATS) to his NKVD handlers. =Death of Lev Sedov= On February 8, 1938, the overworked Sedov suffered a severe attack of appendicitis. Etienne convinced him to have the operation secretly at a small private clinic run by Russian emigres in Paris, the location of which Etienne immediately revealed to the NKVD.\\"Testimony of Mark Zborowski, Accompanied by Herman A. Greenberg, Esq., his Attorney\\", Scope of Soviet Activity in the United States, Hearing Before the Subcommittee to Investigate the Administration of the Internal Security Act and Other Internal Security Laws of the Committee On the Judiciary, United States Senate, Eighty-Fourth Congress, Second Session, February 29, 1956, Part 4. Washington, Government Printing Office, 1956,page 92. (Available online) Sedov was operated on the same evening and appeared, over the next few days, to have a healthy recovery. Suddenly he became violently ill, and despite repeated blood transfusions, he died in great pain on February 16 at the age of thirty-one. Historians differ as to whether or not the NKVD murdered Sedov, and there is considerable evidence to support either scenario. =Internal investigation by Trotskyists= After Sedov's death, Trotsky initiated an investigation of Etienne and entrusted the matter to Rudolf Klement, his one-time aide and organizer of Trotsky's Fourth International. Before Klement could complete the investigation, an NKVD agent named Ale Taubman lured him to an apartment on the Left Bank and murdered him with the help of two other agents, the \\"Turk\\" and Alexander Korotkov. They cut off Klement's head and legs and stuffed the body parts in a trunk and threw it into the Seine. Several days later, the Trotskyists received a typewritten letter from Klement, accusing Trotsky of collaboration with Adolf Hitler. The letter, clearly an NKVD fabrication, was no doubt meant to explain Klement's disappearance and to denounce Trotsky at the same time. However, Klement's headless corpse washed ashore in August 1938 and was identified, from a scar on the one hand, by two Trotskyists. =Death of Trotsky= Etienne now became the leader of the beheaded Trotskyist organization in Paris and continued to edit the Bulletin of the Opposition, along with Lilia Estrin Dallin (codename NEIGHBOR). He used his skills to play upon the vanities of the remaining Trotskyists and create internal divisions within the faction, especially isolating Victor Serge. In 1939, the defector Alexander Orlov sent Trotsky an unsigned letter warning him that an NKVD agent named \\"Mark\\", fitting the description of Zborowski, had infiltrated the Paris organization. Much to her later regret, Dallin convinced Trotsky that the letter was NKVD disinformation meant to create fear within the Trotskyist faction. Meanwhile, Etienne played a small but significant role in the plot to assassinate Trotsky. At the founding conference of the Fourth International in Paris in September 1938, Etienne introduced his friend Sylvia Ageloff, an American Trotskyist and interpreter, to Ram√≥n Mercader, the future assassin of Trotsky. The passionate Mercader seduced the unattractive twenty-eight-year-old woman. She blindly followed him to Mexico and infiltrated him into Trotsky's household. Mercader murdered Trotsky by striking him in the skull with an ice-axe on August 20, 1940. Later life in New York =Tracking of Kravchenko= Zborowski fled to the United States following the German invasion of France. The American Trotskyists David and Lilia Dallin assisted in his emigration and helped him obtain employment at a screw factory in Brooklyn. With money from an unknown source, he rented a fashionable Manhattan apartment in the Dallins' building and once again resumed his former occupation, spying on Trotskyists. His codenames TULIP and KANT appear in nearly two dozen Venona decrypts. He reported to the Soviet controller Jack Soble. Zborowski spied on the Dallins and helped the NKVD search for Victor Kravchenko, a Soviet engineer and mid- level bureaucrat who defected from a trade mission in 1944. Kravchenko published a book, I Chose Freedom (1946), which described the repressions in the Soviet Union, the purges, the collectivizations, and the slave labour camps. =Academia= By 1945, Zborowski's usefulness as an agent had come to an end. He turned his attention to his academic career and found employment, with the aid of Margaret Mead, as a research assistant at Harvard University. In 1952, he published Life is with People (co-authored with Elizabeth Herzog), a groundbreaking study of Jewish life in the shtetls of Eastern Europe before the Second World War. The book received critical acclaim and has been reprinted numerous times. From 1951-1954 he researched at Cornell University. He became an American citizen in 1947. =Senate investigation and conviction= The defector Alexander Orlov unmasked Zborowski before a hearing of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee in September 1955.Testimony of Alexander Orlov before the Subcommittee to Investigate the Administration of the Internal Security Act and other Internal Security Laws, of the Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, December 28, 1955, US Government Printing Office, 1962. The FBI already knew that Zborowski was an NKVD agent from information they had obtained from their double-agent Boris Morros. Zborowski appeared before the Senate Subcommittee in February 1956. Since he was free from prosecution for his activities in France, Zborowski admitted to being an NKVD agent in Paris but he denied working as an agent in America. In his testimony he claimed that the NKVD had tried to enlist him as an agent in New York but he had refused: \\"At that time, I became almost--I became hysterical and I remember well, I hit my fist on the table and said, 'I will not do anything with you anymore.' And I walked out. Since then, I have not seen anyone.\\" As the Venona decrypts clearly prove, Zborowski lied about this and other parts of his testimony.\\"KGB Agent Zborowsky finds defector Kravchenko\\", Venona Message #907, dated 26 June 1944 , VENONA Documents (Release 3), at www.nsa.gov (Accessed 9 February 2013)\\"KGB agent Mark Zborowsky reports on Trotskyites\\", Venona Message #323, dated 5 April 1945 , VENONA Documents (Release 3), at www.nsa.gov (Accessed 9 February 2013) Zborowski was convicted of perjury and after an appeal and retrial he received a four-year prison sentence in 1962. =Return to academia= Following his release, he resumed his academic career and published People in Pain (1969), a study of responses to pain by people of different cultures. He moved to San Francisco, where, in time, he rose to the position of Director of the Pain Institute at Mount Zion Hospital. =Death= Zborowski died in 1990 at the age of eighty-two. Confessions =Confession to Elisabeth Poretsky= When they were both living in the United States, Zborowski came twice to the home of Elisabeth Poretsky one day‚Äîin the spring of 1955, she believed, according to her memoirs. This followed visits by the FBI, who came to her and inquired about \\"Etienne\\" (as she refers to him). During their second visit, the FBI informed her that they believed Zborowski to be an NKVD agent. When she next saw him, Zborowski barged into her home once the door opened. About his overall activities, he confessed: > \\"I came to tell you that it is all true. I have been an N.K.V.D. agent for > more than twenty years\\" ... He did not wait for me to ask him anything, > however, but began to tell me how he had been recruited by a fellow worker, > a Russian, in Grenoble, who had suggested he go to Paris, where he could > find friends and \\"be useful to the Soviet Union.\\" The story of how Etienne > had infiltrated the Trotskyite organization‚Äîwhere, in fact, very little that > was of interest to the N.K.V.D. was going on‚Äîcontained nothing unexpected > ... About the murder of Trotsky's son, he said: > I asked about Sedov who, according to Etienne, had been the main target of > his spying. \\"Do you remember, when I saw you a few days after Sedov's death, > what you told me then and how defeated you were? ... That was the happiest > day of my life ... I did not have to spy on him anymore, I did not have to > denounce him. My job was finished, or so I thought ...\\" About his role in the assassination of Poretsky's husband Ludwik (AKA Ignace Poretsky), he said: > I asked him outright whether it was he who had informed the N.K.V.D. of the > contents of Krivitsky's \\"Krusia\\" letter to me. \\"Did Serge [Sedov] show you > that letter?\\" A wry, pitiful smile on his distorted face and a shrug of the > shoulders were his only reply. It was neither a confirmation nor a denial, > just that helpless smile of his. It as the same with all the questions I > asked about Ludwick's murder. Only a shrug of the shoulders. I knew then > without a doubt who had informed the N.K.V.D. =Confession in Margaret Mead papers= According to Dr. Steven Zipperstein of Stanford University: > Zborowski was not given to self-revelation. But amidst the huge body of > material about Jews collected for Mead's project... is an interview with > Zborowski about his childhood and youth that is probably the most honest > statement he ever recorded. He provided the information in 1947, just before > anti-communism surfaced as a major post-war preoccupation, two years after > his espionage work had ended, and almost a decade before he was unmasked. He > seems to have felt safer from detection, freer to talk, than ever before or > afterwards. He tells of his childhood in Uman and the social downfall of his middle-class parents. His family left Russia for Poland (first Lvov, then ≈Å√≥d≈∫), then how he himself left for France in 1928 with wife Regina. Communists recruited him while he worked as a busboy in Grenoble. In Paris, his quietude and acquiescence won him constant use and confidence among new Lev Sedov and Trotskyist comrades in Paris.

They were originally California's first \\"fully staffed, state-wide transgender legal organization\\" and were initially a fiscally sponsored project of the National Center for Lesbian Rights. The stated mission of TLC is to connect transgender people and their families to technically sound and culturally competent legal services, increase acceptance and enforcement of laws and policies that support California's transgender communities, and work to change laws and systems that fail to incorporate the needs and experiences of transgender people. TLC utilizes direct legal services, public policy advocacy, and educational opportunities to advance the rights and safety of diverse transgender communities. Since launching in 2002, TLC has held over 250 transgender law workshops providing legal information to more than 3,250 community members, attorneys, social service providers, and business owners, as well as collaborated on public policy initiatives designed to improve safety in schools and prisons and safe access to public restrooms for transgender people in San Francisco. TLC successfully helped to revise San Francisco's \\"Regulations to Prohibit Gender Identity Discrimination\\" in December 2003, making them more inclusive of people who do not identify as strictly female or male, and to pass legislation in the City of Oakland banning gender identity discrimination in housing, employment, public accommodation, and city services. Transgender economic health The survey Good Jobs NOW!, conducted jointly by the Transgender Law Center and the San Francisco Bay Guardian in 2006, provided data on the economic reality experienced by transgender people and their families. The team surveyed 194 self-identified transgender people living, working, or looking for work in San Francisco. Survey findings included: * Nearly 60% of respondents earned under $15,300 annually * 40% did not have a bank account * Only 25% were working full-time * 10% were homeless A statewide survey, \\"The State of Transgender California Report,\\" was conducted in 2008. Findings included that respondents were more than twice as likely to live under the poverty line as the general population. Nashville controversy On May 21, 2018, members of the TLC as well as the Transgender Education Network of Texas were denied service at the Elliston Place IHOP in Nashville, Tennessee. The IHOP issued an apology.

A network monitoring interface card or NMIC is similar to a network card (NIC). However, unlike a standard network card, an NMIC is designed to passively (and silently) listen on a network. At a functional level, an NMIC may differ from a NIC, in that the NMIC may not have a MAC address, may lack the ability to transmit and may not announce its presence on a network. Advanced NMICs have features that include an ability to offload CPU intensive processing from a system's CPU, accurate time measurement, traffic filtering, and an ability to perform other application specific processing. Organizations often use a dedicated interface for all management traffic and thus create a management network. This is done to minimize the impact on production traffic, ensure the integrity of management traffic and it helps by measuring true production traffic not the traffic generated to the act of measuring traffic. This is a separate function from NMICs that are used for data collection and processing. NMICs are typically used in intrusion detection and prevention (IDS/IPS), lawful interception, flow analysis, network monitoring, and protocol analyzer systems. Notable manufacturers include Endace, SolarFLare, Intel, and ALBEDO Telecom.

Contract management includes negotiating the terms and conditions in contracts and ensuring compliance with the terms and conditions, as well as documenting and agreeing on any changes or amendments that may arise during its implementation or execution. It can be summarized as the process of systematically and efficiently managing contract creation, execution, and analysis for the purpose of maximizing financial and operational performance and minimizing risk. Common commercial contracts include employment letters, sales invoices, purchase orders, and utility contracts. Complex contracts are often necessary for construction projects, goods or services that are highly regulated, goods or services with detailed technical specifications, intellectual property (IP) agreements, outsourcing and international trade. Most larger contracts require the effective use of contract management software to aid administration among multiple parties. A study has found that for \\"42% of enterprises...the top driver for improvements in the management of contracts is the pressure to better assess and mitigate risks\\" and additionally,\\"nearly 65% of enterprises report that contract lifecycle management (CLM) has improved exposure to financial and legal risk.\\" Contracts A contract is a written or oral legally-binding agreement between the parties identified in the agreement to fulfill the terms and conditions outlined in the agreement. A prerequisite requirement for the enforcement of a contract, amongst other things, is the condition that the parties to the contract accept the terms of the claimed contract. Historically, this was most commonly achieved through signature or performance, but in many jurisdictions - especially with the advance of electronic commerce - the forms of acceptance have expanded to include various forms of electronic signature. Contracts can be of many types, e.g. sales contracts (including leases), purchasing contracts, partnership agreements, trade agreements, and intellectual property agreements. *A sales contract is a contract between a company (the seller) and a customer where the company agrees to sell products and/or services and the customer in return is obligated to pay for the product/services bought. *A purchasing contract is a contract between a company (the buyer) and a supplier who is promising to sell products and/or services within agreed terms and conditions. The company (buyer) in return is obligated to acknowledge the goods / or service and pay for liability created. When the purchasing contract is between a retailer and manufacturer, the contract also includes conditions for processing returned items. However due to the cost of reverse logistics, retailers often dispose of returns rather than sending them the back to the vendor. *A partnership agreement may be a contract which formally establishes the terms of a partnership between two legal entities such that they regard each other as 'partners' in a commercial arrangement. However, such expressions may also be merely a means to reflect the desire of the contracting parties to act 'as if' both are in a partnership with common goals. Therefore, it might not be the common law arrangement of a partnership which by definition creates fiduciary duties and which also has 'joint and several' liabilities. Areas of contract management The business-standard contract management model, as employed by many organizations in the United States, typically exercises purview over the following business disciplines: *Authorizing and negotiation *Baseline management *Commitment management *Communication management. *Contract visibility and awareness *Document management *Growth (for Sales-side contracts) *Contract compliance/governance Change management There may be occasions where what is agreed in a contract needs to be changed later on. A number of bases may be used to support a subsequent change, so that the whole contract remains enforceable under the new arrangement. A change may be based on: *A mutual agreement of both parties to vary the contract, outside the framework of the existing contract. This would be an independent basis for changing the contract. *A unilateral decision to vary the contract, contemplated and allowed for by the existing contract. This would normally have notice periods for fairness and often the right of the other, especially in consumer contracts, to cease the contractual relationship. Be careful that any one-way imposition of change is contractually justified, otherwise it may be interpreted as a repudiation of the original contract, enabling the other party to terminate the contract and seek damages. *A bilateral decision to vary the contracting, within the variation or change control process outlined in the existing contract. These are often called change control provisions. Phases of contract management Contract management can be divided into three phases Contract & Commercial Management - The Operational Guide, Van Haren Publishing, October 2011, namely * pre- contract phase * contract execution phase * post award phase (often referred to as contract compliance/governance) Another dimension of the debates on the phases of contract management relates to the interplay between contracts and trust. In particular, management scholars have discussed the nature of the relationship between contract and trust development. On the one hand, some have argued that contracts and trust would substitute each other; that is, the use of one mechanism decreases the advantages of the other. On the other hand, others suggest contract and trust complement each other; that is, the use of one increases the benefits of using the other mechanism. Contract compliance/governance During the post-award phase, it is important to ensure that contract conditions and terms are met, but it is also critical to take a closer look for items such as unrecorded liabilities, under-reported revenue or overpayments. If these items are overlooked, margin may be negatively impacted. A contract compliance audit will often commence with an opportunity review to identify the highest risk areas. Having a dedicated contract compliance (and/or governance) program in place has been shown to result in a typical recovery of 2-4% and sometimes as high as 20%.\\"California Energy Commission:2008 Energy Efficiency Standards\\"http://www.energy.ca.gov/2008publications/CEC-400-2008-016/CEC-400-2008-016-CMF- REV1.PDFaccessdate=2016-08-16} Current thinking about contract management in complex relationships is shifting from a compliance ‚Äúmanagement‚Äù to a ‚Äúgovernance‚Äù perspective, with the focus on creating a governance structure in which the parties have a vested interest in managing what are often highly complex contractual arrangements in a more collaborative, aligned, flexible, and credible way. In 1979, Nobel laureate Oliver Williamson wrote that the governance structure is the ‚Äúframework within which the integrity of a transaction is decided.‚Äù He further added that ‚Äúbecause contracts are varied and complex, governance structures vary with the nature of the transaction.‚Äù Williamson, Oliver E.1979\\"Transaction-Cost Economics: The Governance of Contractual Relations,\\"Journal of Law and Economics: Vol. 22: No. 2, Article 3accessible at: http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/jle/vol22/iss2/3 A collaborative governance framework has four components: *A relationship management structure (how the parties work together to make both day-to-day operational decisions as well as strategic decisions) *A joint performance and transformation management process designed to track the overall performance of the partnership *An exit management plan as a controlling mechanism to encourage the organizations to make ethical, proactive changes for the mutual benefit of all the parties. *Compliance to special concerns and regulations, which include the more traditional components of contract compliance  Managerial functions  Scholars in business and management have paid attention to the role of contracts to manage relationships between individuals or between organizations. In particular, contracts work as instruments of control and coordination. On the one hand, contracts can moderate the risks of exploitation or misappropriation by an opportunistic partner. On the other hand, contracts can help foster communication and information sharing between parties.

Many of these compounds are used as pesticides, some have medical applications, and some are used as oil additives.J. Svara, N. Weferling, T. Hofmann \\"Phosphorus Compounds, Organic\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2006. They generally have the chemical formula (RO)3PS, [(RO)2P(S)O]‚àí, R(RO)2PS, etc. Oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (OPS) are modified oligonucleotides where one of the oxygen atoms in the phosphate moiety is replaced by sulfur. These compounds are the basis of antisense therapy, e.g., the drugs fomivirsen (Vitravene), Oblimersen, Alicaforsen, and Mipomersen (Kynamro).Kurreck, J., \\"Antisense technologies. Improvement through novel chemical modifications\\", European Journal of Biochemistry 2003, 270, 1628-1644. Further examples of these include: * Diazinon * Fenitrothion * Fenthion * Thiotepa Variants with P=S double bonds were developed as insecticides because of their reduced mammalian toxicity. The phosphorothioate P=S bond is converted to the toxic P=O bond in the target insect. Similar oxidative conversion in mammals is slower, conferring lower toxicity in mammals. Structure and chemical synthesis Generally these compounds feature tetrahedral phosphorus(V) centers. Classically, thiophosphates would include a P=S double bond as illustrated by malathion. The terminology is used loosely and thiophosphates include P-S single bonds as illustrated by the drug amifostine. P‚ÄìS single bonds can be generated through a variety of approaches, starting from thiols, disulfides, sulfinic acids as sulfur sources and various P(III) and P(V) coupling partners. PS‚ÄìC bonds can also be formed through many comparable approaches, usually by alkylating a free phosphorous thioate anion or thioic acid. They are conceptually derived from the inorganic thiophosphates (PO4‚àíxS). In fact, many are prepared via the intermediacy diorganodithiophosphoric acids, which are prepared by treating phosphorus pentasulfide with alcohols: :P2S5 \\\\+ 4 ROH ‚Üí 2 (RO)2PS2H + H2S Dimethyl dithiophosphoric acid and diethyl dithiophosphoric acid are obtained in this way.

Before Written History Okemos, in full tribal gear especially for the portrait, circa 1850.The area that was later to become Williamston was the 'summer home' of a group of Chippewa people (a band among the Ottawa tribe). This land was used by them for planting what few crops they needed, holding an annual 'spring gathering' of related bands of the tribe, and burying the dead. The most famous Native American resident was Okemos, whose name survives as a postal address in nearby Meridian Township. Okemos (\\"Little Chief\\" or chief of subordinate authority‚Äîit is unclear if his name was meant to reference his stature‚Äîhe was described as short by many contemporaries‚Äîor his authority‚Äîhe had few if any directly subordinate tribesmen) had a relatively well-documented life. An ally of the British in the War of 1812, he was so badly wounded during an attack on a U.S. Cavalry unit near Sandusky that he bore a four- or five-inch-long scar from a saber on his left forehead the rest of his life. (See for example, Michigan Pioneer and Historical Society Collection, Vol. XXVII. Indian Funeral Scene. M. D. Chatterson. Lansing, MI: Robert Smith Printing Co., State Printers and Binders, 1897 for more detail.) Beginnings of European Settlement Looking westbound on Grand River Avenue, circa 1900.The region that was later to become Williamston was first settled by people of European ancestry in 1834 by Hiram and Joseph Putnam, who moved to the area from Jackson, Michigan. When moving, the two cut an approximately 20-mile (32 km) road through the dense forest between what is now Stockbridge and the Cedar River (now called the Red Cedar River). This road still exists today as Williamston Road, and, inside the Williamston city limits, it is named \\"Putnam Street\\" in the family's honor. Upon arriving in the area, the two made a settlement on the north bank of the river on a former Native American planting ground, built a log cabin, and started farming the land. =Phelpstown / Williamstown= After only one season of poor farming, the Putnams returned to Jackson, abandoning the land. In 1838, a settler named David Phelps moved to the region from New York State. He started a small settlement which, along with the present-day townships of Locke, and Williamstown, became known as \\"Phelpstown\\". In 1839, the Putnams sold their land to Oswald B., James M., and Horace B. Williams, three brothers who came from Batavia, New York. James M. \\"Miles\\" Williams, who built a dam, saw mill and later a grist mill in town, eventually platted the land in 1845. The Michigan Legislature divided the original township into the two present townships in 1842, and changed the name of the easternmost section to \\"Williamstown\\" in 1857. It is unknown how the Village lost the \\"w\\" in its name, however, the Township as it exists today retains the original spelling. The town was a popular stop on the Grand River trail (that later became a plank road) from Detroit to Lansing in the 19th century. That trail is now Grand River Avenue (M-43) which runs through downtown Williamston. Because the primary means of transportation at that time was the horse and buggy and because the trip from Detroit to Lansing often took more than one day, Williamston became a convenient overnight stop. =Modern Williamston= Village Hall/Fire station/GAR Hall as it appeared circa 1925. This building still serves as the City Hall. Williamston was incorporated as a village by the Michigan Legislature April 5, 1871, the same year the Howell and Lansing railroad from Detroit to Lansing sited a depot in Williamston as one of the intermediate stops. From this time until about World War I Williamston was the commercial and social 'hub' of the farming and early industrial society in Eastern Ingham County. After the war, the industrial growth in the area concentrated in larger cities such as Lansing and population of Williamston stagnated as many younger residents left rural life for the city, and the businesses supporting them followed. Williamston was incorporated as a city by vote of the population on April 1, 1945. A later revised City Charter was adopted by the people effective in April 1963. This charter has been amended several times, but remains in effect today. A history for the area was published for the city's centennial celebration in 1971. It included many photographs and stories (and more than a few errors!) of the early city and its inhabitants. There were earlier histories, as well, published in 1963, the 1930s, and in 1880.

Robert's exact origins are unclear. He was an Augustinian canon at the Priory of St. Oswalds, at Nostell. His French name indicates a Norman rather than an Anglo-Saxon origin, but as he was likely born in the later 11th century, this may be due merely to the acculturation of his parents. Prior of Scone Robert was one of the most important clerics in the reign of King Alexander I of Scotland (Alaxandair mac Ma√≠l Coluim). He was appointed as the first Prior of Scone, the flagship Augustinian monastic establishment of Alexander's reign. This may have happened as early as 1114, and Walter Bower tells us that the new priory was dedicated by Thurgot, then bishop of Cell R√≠gmonaid. As Turgot left Scotland in 1115, no later date would be possible if Bower is to be believed. Many historians have rejected this date, because the Augustinian Rule was not instituted at Nostell until 1119, but as Kenneth Veitch points out, the date of the formal institution of the Rule is little guide to the actual activities of the monastic establishment. Moreover, the year 1114 just happened to be the year in which Alexander was present in England in the service of his overlord, King Henry I of England. Bishop of St Andrews It was this context that made Robert a natural candidate for the chief Scottish bishopric. He was probably elected to the bishopric in 1124. The Chronicle of Melrose tells us that \\"in the same year, four months before his death, he [Alexander] had caused Robert, prior of Scone, to be elected bishop of St Andrews, but his ordination (i.e. consecration) was delayed for some time\\".Chronica de Mailros (Bannatyne Club), s.a. 1124, translated and quoted in The delay was certainly caused by the issue of submission to the archbishops of York, which the archbishops pressed for, but the kings of Alba refused to allow. Robert however was able to attain consecration at the hands of Thurstan, Archbishop of York in 1127, with no profession of obedience being made; it is possible the consecration took place after a meeting organized in the summer of 1127 at the church of St John at Roxburgh, where it was probably agreed that the lack of submission would not constitute a precedent. Robert and monastic patronage Robert's three decade episcopate would prove to be one of the most important in the history of the bishopric. Robert was not perhaps as successful as he might have been in promoting the Augustinian Order in Scotland, but he nevertheless managed to bring Augustinians to St Andrews to found a Cathedral Priory in 1144. It is relatively clear that he did this with the co-operation of Athelwold, the first prior of St. Oswald's, and Bishop of Carlisle, a fellow Nostell monk who was head of Robert's religious community in the days before the latter moved to Scotland. Robert also established two great Augustinian abbeys, Holyrood Abbey and the Arrouaisian abbey of St Mary at Stirling (Cambuskenneth). Robert's role was not simply that of a promoter of the Augustinian Order. His post was that of Summi (Archi)Episcopi Scotorum, called in the contemporary Scottish vernacular \\"Ardepscop Alban\\", that is, \\"High Bishop of Scotland\\". He was hence the structural leader of the Scottish church. Along with Bishop John of Glasgow, Robert became the chief reforming cleric in the reforming reign of King David I of Scotland. He is one of the most frequent witnesses to the charters of King David. Unlike most other incumbents Scottish bishoprics, most of them very new, Robert was a foreigner drawn from the non-Gaelic world, in the words of Oram, \\"part of 'colonial' establishment which was emerging in the early twelfth century\\". In this context, the difference between \\"reform\\" and religious and cultural \\"colonialism\\" is merely one of perspective.e.g. However, Robert's episcopate in no way led to the destruction of the native clerical order at Cell R√≠gmonaid. In fact, many of the native Gaelic clergy were absorbed into the incoming orders, and those who were not, continued to receive the patronage of the bishop. In one case, the clergy of the C√©li D√© abbey of St. Serfs at Loch Leven were given a large collection of books by the bishop. Quest for archiepisicopal status By 1151, King David had decided to request a pallium for the bishopric, elevating the see to archiepiscopal status and creating an archdiocese embracing all Scottish sees, including the bishoprics of Orkney and the Isles. This would have made Robert the first Scottish archbishop to have his status recognized by Rome. The request was prompted by the arrival in Scotland of the Papal Legate John Paparo, on his way to Ireland to create four new archbishoprics there. When the legate arrived back madein Scotland in 1152, David submitted a request. However, the proposal appears never to have been made to the Pope by the Cardinal, and the ambitions of Bishop Robert and King David were further subverted in the same year when the Papacy created the Archbishopric of Trondheim (Ni√∞aros), embracing both Orkney and the Isles. By the later 1150s, bishop Robert is described as \\"oppressed by age and infirmity\\" in a bull of Pope Adrian IV. He may have died in 1158, but more probably died the following year.

After teaching English in Japan, Sen returned to the United States to become the editor of Asia magazine. In 1920 she undertook a round-the-world expedition which included stunt flying and caving. Eventually she settled in a village in northeastern India, participated in rural life, married Indian native Basiswar Sen on November 1, 1932, and came to love the culture of her adopted country. Her attachment is reflected in her books Voiceless India (1930) and Pageant of India's History (1948). Although not born in India herself, she strongly disapproved on the involvement of non-Indians in subcontinental matters. Sen died in 1982, aged 89.

Horgan (born 26 October 1940) is a former Labour Party politician, professor of Journalism at Dublin City University and, from 2007 to 2014. the first Press Ombudsman in Ireland. Early life and Family Horgan is the grandson of John J. Horgan, a solicitor and politician associated with both the Irish Parliamentary Party and the Irish Volunteers. The son of doctors he was brought up in County Kerry, his mother Gwen (Jane) Richards was an english born methodist whose father was also a doctor. He graduated in 1962 from University College Dublin.The Long View The Irish Echo, October 2018. Horgans Ph.D. thesis was supervised by Professor John Joseph Lee also a former senator and became the book Se√°n Lemass: The Enigmatic Patriot. Horgan is married to Mary Jones, their daughter Jane Horgan-Jones is a Dublin City Councilor for the Labour party and their son Jack is a reporter with the Sunday Business Post. His son from his first marriage Conor is a filmmaker and photographer. Political career Horgan began his career in 1962 as a journalist on the Evening Press. He later worked as a staff journalist on the Catholic Herald and The Irish Times, where he wrote about religion and education. In 1969 Horgan was elected as a member of the 12th Seanad √âireann, representing the National University of Ireland. He was re-elected in 1973, to the 13th Seanad. At the general election in 1977 he was elected to D√°il √âireann as a TD for Dublin County South. After boundary changes for the general election of 1981 he was not re-elected in the new constituency of Dublin South and he was also unsuccessful at the general election in February 1982. He did not stand again. After John O'Connell resigned as one of the two Labour Party Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) for Dublin Horgan was appointed to replace him on 21 October 1981. He served in the European Parliament only until March 1983, when he resigned to take up an academic post.  After politics  Horgan was appointed in 1983 as a lecturer in what was then the National Institute for Higher Education in Dublin. In 1989 it became Dublin City University (DCU) and he was appointed Professor of Journalism, a position he held until his retirement in 2006. He was also a member of the Interim Radio Commission, the Commission on the Newspaper Industry and the Forum on Broadcasting. =Press Ombudsman= In August 2007 the newly formed Press Council of Ireland appointed Horgan as Ireland's first-ever Press Ombudsman. The Press Council began operations on 11 January 2008. Its Code of Practice sets out the standards expected from newspapers and periodicals published in Ireland, and members of the public can raise complaints about articles that directly affect or involve them, and that may breach the Code. The Ombudsman's role is to mediate and, if necessary, adjudicate on cases where a complainant has not reached agreement with a publisher. More complex cases may be referred to the full Press Council. The new system was launched partly to provide an alternatively to increasingly costly litigation and to head off the threat of a new privacy law. On 9 January 2008 the Minister for Justice, Brian Lenihan, announced that a proposed new privacy law would be postponed for two years to give the Press Ombudsman \\"an opportunity to establish himself and the credibility of his office\\". On 28 March 2014 Horgan announced that he would step down as Press Ombudsman on 1 September 2014. On that date Peter Feeney succeeded Horgan in the post.

He served the state of Qin as an administrator and has become renowned for his association with the Dujiangyan Irrigation System, the construction of which he is traditionally said to have instigated and overseen. Because of the importance of this 2000-year-old irrigation system to the development of Sichuan and the Yangtze River region, Li Bing became a great Chinese cultural icon, hailed as a great civil administrator and water conservation expert. In Chinese mythology, he is known as the vanquisher of the River God and is compared to the Great Yu. Dujiangyan is still in use today and is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Life and career The central sections of the Dujiangyan. The map showing the plan of Dujiangyan project King Zhaoxiang of Qin (r. 306‚Äì251 BC) dispatched Li Bing as joint military and civilian governor (shou) over Shu, a recently defeated state in Sichuan province, Southwest China, just west of modern Chengdu. According to the Records of the Grand Historian, Li Bing was appointed governor of Shu in c. 277 BC.Sage, Steven F., Ancient Sichuan and the Unification of China. Albany, New York: State University of New York Press (1992). 148.Records of the Grand Historian. cxvi (Xi nan yi lie zhuan), 2995 However, the Chronicles of Huayang place Li Bing in Shu in 272 BC.Chang Jue's Huayang-guo zhi. Shanghai: Shanghai Ancient Books Publishing House. 132 - 141Taming the floodwaters: The high heritage price of massive hydraulic projects. China Heritage Newsletter. China Heritage Project, The Australian National University. No. 1, 2005.03. He arrived just as Zhang Ruo had put down the last of the marquis rebellions and moved out to engage the Chu city of Yan. Zhang Ruo did not leave any incumbent ministers, and Li Bing had complete control over Shu. (Sage, 149) \\"When he arrived in Shu, Li Bing witnessed the sufferings of local people from frequent flooding of the Min River.\\" Additionally, the Qin monarchy had been sending its exiles to this state and the Qin military needed food and infrastructure. Li Bing then created ‚Äúthe largest, most carefully planned public works project yet seen anywhere on the eastern half of the Eurasian continent.‚Äù It would be called Dujiangyan. (Sage, 149) He conducted an extensive hydraulic survey of the Min River in order to stabilize the waters from flooding settlements and plot out an extension into Chengdu. This extension would be a fairway to provide logistical military support to the Chengdu supply lines. This is standard practice for Qin administrators who routinely combine their agricultural projects for both civilian and military purposes. (Ibid) The Min River is 735 km long and it is the largest and the longest of the Yangtze tributaries. Li Bing faced a number of daunting tasks. Firstly, the Qin administration was more experienced working with arid lands than with wet rice paddies. Additionally, by slowing the water current, this reduced the river‚Äôs ability to carry away large amounts of sediment. At peak discharge, the Min flows at about 5000 or even 6000 cubic meters per second. At low water, it lessens to about 500 cubic meters per second. (Elvin, 121 edited) On the other hand, the water diversion would have a positive effect and with the Qin system of land distribution with wet paddy rice in the Chengdu plains. But that was only half of the problem. The other half had to do with Shu culture. The native Animist people of Shu believed that the Min was a deity. As recorded in the Shiji, ‚ÄúSima Qian relates the tale that, upon appointment as administrator of Po, a province of Wei, Ximen Bao discouraged the superstition of the people about a bride for the god of the river and punished the local gentry and bureaucrats who took advantage of such superstitions.‚Äù (Chi, 67) This was the ordinary practice of Administrators across the region. But, Ximen Bao did not succeed. Therefore, in order to avert a similar massive revolt, Li Bing set out to end this practice ‚Äúby a combination of tact and showmanship‚Äù. (Sage, 150) Steven Sage describes from the Shiji that the first thing Li Bing did was set up a temple to honor the Min deity. He then offered his own two daughters as brides to the deity. But first he set up a large nuptial banquet along the river. He offered a toast. But the deity did not drink his glass of wine. Deeply offended, Li Bing runs off sword drawn. Two bulls prepared in advance were then seen by the crowd fighting along the river bank. Symbolically, this was Li Bing in a duel with the deity. Li Bing returns to the scene sweating as if in battle and calls for assistance. One of his lieutenants ran up to the bull that Li Bing had pointed out was the deity and killed the bull. The river spirit was subdued. ‚ÄúThrough the medium of the bull, Li Bing had won.‚Äù(Sage 150-151{Shiji, ch.116, xi nan yi lie zhuan, pp 2995‚Äì2996.}) ‚ÄúIn 268 BC, Li Bing is said to have personally led tens of thousands of workers in the initial stage of construction on the Min River banks.‚Äù (CHN, Strategic Origins) These people were mostly exiles from lands conquered by the Qin, as well as Qin pioneers, and the local population. Legacy Li Bing was given the title of king during the Song dynasty for his achievement. This was highly unusual. Only in a few cases in Chinese history was a man not actually a member of royal family given the title king (others are Kong Qiu, Guan Yu, and Yue Fei). \\"As an irrigation project, it may not seem to deserve being ranked alongside the Pyramids or the Taj Mahal, but it is actually one of mankind's most extraordinary achievements. ... The ancient Roman engineer, Sextus Julius Frontinus who wrote ... in the first century after Christ that his aqueducts were indispensable, and would be remembered long after \\"the idle pyramids, or the useless though famous works of the Greeks.\\"\\" Li Bing had achieved an engineering masterwork that had been done as a response to a public need and it has succeeded in taming a river for the subsequent time since its completion in 250 BC. No other wonder of the ancient world continues to function as it was designed. This project was completed 300 years prior to the work of Frontinus in Rome.Winchester, Simon; The Man Who Loved China: the fantastic story of the eccentric scientist who unlocked the mysteries of the middle kingdom; HarperCollins Publishers, 2008, References External links *Chi, Ch‚Äòao-ting.

It borders the neighborhoods of Northwest Industrial on the south, St. Johns and Cathedral Park via the St. Johns Bridge across the Willamette on the east, and Forest Park (with which it overlaps substantially) on the west. The neighborhood extends north somewhat beyond Portland city limits into unincorporated Multnomah County, ending at the Sauvie Island Bridge.  History  According to Oregon Geographic Names, the Town of Linnton was platted in 1843 by Peter Burnett (later, the first governor of California) and Morton M. McCarver. The two named the community for U.S. Senator Lewis F. Linn of Missouri, a proponent of settling the Oregon Country. Linnton had its own post office from 1889‚Äì1975. Industrialization began in 1889 when the Portland Smelting Company started to build a smelting plant, followed by the Linnton Manufacturing Company starting in 1892. Columbia Engineering Works arrived in Linnton in 1910. Linnton was incorporated on October 5, 1910, after a vote on September 12. At that time it was a company town for Clark-Wilson and West Oregon lumber mills, and the Columbia Engineering Works shipyard. In 1913, the Portland Gas & Coke Company moved its manufacturing plant to the town's southern border large oil refiners began to purchase sites for shipping and storage. Linnton was soon annexed by Portland in 1915, bringing with it much of today's Forest Park. In 2006 there was talk of secession following a rejection by Portland Mayor Tom Potter and two other city council members of a waterfront revitalization plan over toxic industrial waste concerns.

The world is 'going our way', the leaders of 'the free world' have declared. The iron curtain has come tumbling down. The Kremlin has been conquered without a single marine opening fire, without a single ICBM being launched. It unravels before me like a nightmare. No more the red flags flying. No more the heads held high and the fists clenched and the voices raised to the strains of The International. No more the larger-than-life murals of workers and soldiers and peasants marching into the future shaping the world with the labour of their hands and hearts and minds. Now it is to be Mickey Mouse and Coca Cola and Michael Jackson and Sacchi & Sacchi.\\" Quotes * On her life: > \\"Sometimes I feel as if I have lived eons in a matter of decades.

In English its versions were collected by Francis James Child as Child Ballad number 13.Francis James Child, English and Scottish Popular Ballads, \\"Edward\\" The Roud number is 200. Synopsis A mother questions her son about the blood on his sword. He puts her off with claims that it is his hawk or his horse, in some combination, but finally admits that it is his brother, or his father, whom he has killed. He declares that he is leaving and will never return, and various creatures (wife, children, livestock) will have to fare without him. His mother then asks what she will get from his departure. He answers \\"a curse from hell\\" and implicates his mother in the murder.  Parallels  This ballad may not be complete in itself. Large portions of the ballad are also found in the longer ballads \\"The Twa Brothers\\" (Child 49) and \\"Lizie Wan\\" (Child 51).Francis James Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, vol. 1, p. 167, Dover Publications, New York 1965  Parallels in other languages  This ballad type was also found in Northern Europe, where it is often known under \\"Svend i Rosensg√•rd\\" or a similar name. Its general Scandinavian classification is TSB D 320, and it is known in Danish (DgF 340), Icelandic (IFkv 76), Norwegian, and Swedish (SMB 153). In Finland, it is popular as \\"Poikani Poloinen\\", both as a poem and as a song, first published in the collection Kanteletar. In the Scandinavian versions, and the Finnish one, the stress is more on the gradual divulge of the fact that the son will never return home to his mother.  Irish versions  Versions collected orally in Ireland are usually named \\"What Put the Blood\\" or similar. The version sung by County Fermanagh traditional singer Paddy Tunney is on his Folk-Legacy CD The Man of Songs. He called it \\"What put the Blood on Your Right Shoulder, Son?\\"\\"O'er his grave the grass grew green\\", Tragic Ballads, The Voice of the People vol. 3, Topic TSCD 653 (1975) Ellen Connors of County Wexford called it \\"What Brought the Blood\\".O'Boyle, Se√°n: The Irish Song Tradition. Toronto: Macmillan, 1976, pp. 90‚Äì91 The versions collected from traveller John (\\"Jacko\\") Reilly in the 1960s in Boyle, County Roscommon became very popular in Ireland, as they were recorded by folk singers of the day.John Reilly, Topic 12T 359, 1969 (\\"The Bonny Green Tree\\")Folktrax 175-C60 (\\"John Reilly\\"), 1967 There are recordings by Christy Moore, The Johnstons, Karan Casey, Al O'Donnell and others.  Percy's \\"Edward\\"  The authenticity of one popular version of this ballad (Child 13B) has been called into question.Most notable is Bertrand Bronson in \\"Edward, Edward. A Scottish Ballad and a Footnote,\\" in The Ballad as Song (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1969). This version originally appeared in print in Bishop Percy's 1765 edition of Reliques of Ancient English Poetry. Percy reported that he received this Scottish ballad from Sir David Dalrymple, who said he heard it from an unnamed lady. This version appears inauthentic because it seems, in short, too \\"good\\": it makes exceptional use of literary devices for maximum impact. Moreover, unlike most other versions, the father is the victim rather than the brother, and the mother receives a curse at the end. There is also little evidence that this version was disseminated orally; it seems to have appeared most often in print form.  Adaptations  * Carl Loewe set a German translation of Percy's version to music in his Op. 1, No. 1 (1817/18). * Franz Schubert also used Percy's version in his \\"Eine altschottische Ballade\\" D. 923 (1827). * Johannes Brahms was inspired by Percy's version of \\"Edward\\" twice in his ballades, in opus 10 (1854) and opus 75, no. 1 (late 1870s). * Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky used a translation by Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy in his Six Duets with piano accompaniment, Op. 46, No. 2 (1880).\\"Six Duets (–®–µ—Å—Ç—å –¥—É—ç—Ç–æ–≤)\\", Tchaikovsky Research * Algernon Charles Swinburne's poem \\"The Bloody Son\\" in his collection Poems and Ballads, 1866 * Nic Jones recorded a version of \\"Edward\\" on his 1971 album Nic Jones. * Steeleye Span recorded a version of \\"Edward\\", arranged in a 'question and answer' format by Bob Johnson on the 1986 album Back in Line. * Amps for Christ recorded a version on their 1999 album Circuits. * James Yorkston recorded a version on his 2004 album Just Beyond the River. * Sam Amidon recorded a version on his 2010 album I See the Sign. * Oysterband recorded a version called \\"Son David\\" on Ragged Kingdom, their 2011 collaboration with June Tabor. *Terrance Zdunich and Saar Hendelman recorded a version of \\"Edward\\" on their 2016 American Murder Song album Dawn See also *List of the Child Ballads  References   External links  * \\"The Murdered Brother\\", an American variant * Percy's version Child Ballads Roud Folk Song Index songs Murder ballads ","title":"Edward (ballad)"},{"id":"5752433","text":"Brian Trench (born 13 July 1945) is a writer and academic living in Dublin, who has been centrally involved in developing science communication and science-in-society studies in Ireland.

He is also a screenplay writer, dialogue writer, instrumentalist and a conductor. Composed and written for over 500 feature films. Hamsalekha is usually referred to by the title Naadha Brahma (English: The Brahma of Music) who is considered to be the major cause for the change in the music composing and lyric writing style which would appeal much to the younger generation. He integrated folk and introduced western musical sensibilities into the mainstream cinema. He is also accredited for introducing many musical talents (singers, composers and lyricists) to the industry. Hamsalekha has won one National Film Awards and six Filmfare Awards in the Best Music Director Category; seven Karnataka State Film Awards - four for music direction and three for lyrics - and is a recipient of an honorary doctorate from Bangalore University. Early career Hamsalekha was born Govindaraju Gangaraju in Mandya, India. After his studies, he was employed in his father's printing press and subsequently joined his brother Balakrishna's orchestra group. He had a huge flair for writing poetry and forming a tune for his works. He renamed himself as \\"Hamsalekhani\\" since he always used to write with a \\"Swan\\"(Kannada : Hamsa) brand pen given by Lavani Neelakantappa his then Guru. Later, his teacher modified his name as \\"Hamsalekha\\". He was introduced into feature films by director M. N. Prasad, who provided an opportunity to write a song for the film Triveni (1973). The song \\"Neena Bhagavantha\\" was his first release picturised on actor Udaykumar. His debut film as a musician was the 1981 unreleased film Rahuchandra. Officially, his cinema career started as a dialogue and lyric writer for the film Naanu Nanna Hendthi (1985). Later his popularity soared only after his association with actor-director Ravichandran. Premaloka, released in 1987, brought them together for a collaboration that would endure for over 12 years. Family life Hamsalekha is married to Latha who was a playback singer in the 1990s. The couple have a son named Alankar and two daughters named Tejaswini and Nandini. Alankar is associated with films as an actor and musician. Few of his released and unreleased movies are Sugghi, Tapori and Roja. Tejaswini is associated with film direction, acting and directing plays, she has done her master's in theater from bangalore university and directed many plays in association with her father Hamsalekha. Nandini began her playback singing career with the film Sixer (2006). Notable works After working on Premaloka, Hamsalekha became one of the most prolific music directors in Kannada film, with many hits. He made occasional use of many genres of music, including Western, pop, rock, hip hop, Indian classical, folk, ghazals, Sufi, and item songs. \\"Chandakinta Chanda\\", a ghazal he composed for the film Sparsha, was a major hit. He has created songs ranging from the philosophical (\\"Le Le Marula\\" in Shaapa, a film whose story he wrote himself) to the naughty (\\"Kaayi Kaayi Nuggekaayi Mahimege\\" in Halli Maestru), the patriotic (\\"Huttidhare Kannada Nadalli Hutta Bekku\\" in Rajkumar's Aakasmika, a song which has become an unofficial anthem of Karnataka) and love songs (\\"Ele Hombisile...\\" in Halunda Tavaru). He composed the background score for one movie using a single instrument and made the music for Kona Eedaite with no instruments at all. His music in the film Hagalu Vesha had a rustic and folk feel without the use of synthetic sounds. His music in the 2010 movie Naanu Nanna Kanasu was appreciated by critics as well as audiences. He also composed for the National Award-winning movie Puttakkana Highway in 2011. The melodic structure of his songs demand considerable vocal virtuosity, and have found expressive platform amongst some of India's respected vocalists and playback singers, such as Dr. Rajkumar, P. B. Sreenivas, S. Janaki, P. Susheela, K. J. Yesudas, S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, Vani Jairam, Swarnalatha, K. S. Chithra, Kavita Krishnamurthy, Anuradha Paudwal, B. R.

At the close of voting, it had received 118 points, placing 4th of 23. This song is a love song; for a dramatic appearance, she appeared dressed in a white gown and cloak. She was accompanied on stage by one female backing singer dressed in black. At the start of the second verse, she removed the cloak, to reveal a tight bodice. When the number of countries wishing to enter the contest increased sharply, Eurovision began calculating an average of each country's scores from previous years; countries with the best marks could compete in following years. When it emerged that Dragoviƒá used offstage accompaniment (i.e. vocals by a male voice choir not on stage), Croatia was penalised by removal of one third of its marks average. It was too late to dock points from that night's score. Goran Karan with \\"Kad zaspu anƒëeli\\" succeeded Dragoviƒá as Croatian representative at the 2000 Contest.

Collections and exhibitions  Pool view with Diamond Head, Hawaii Sea view The Shangri La Museum for Islamic Art, Design & Culture displays a wide- ranging collection of art, furnishings, and built-in architectural elements from Iran, Morocco, Turkey, Spain, Syria, Egypt, and India - among others. Gilt and painted ceilings from Morocco, vivid ceramics from Iran (including the only complete lusterware Ilkhanid mihrab in North America), painted wooden interiors from Syria, pierced metalwork and vibrant textiles from Spain to India (including a magnificent pair of shaped carpets, made for the Mughal emperor) are among the many highlights. Its multiple buildings on the campus also include The Playhouse (a reduced-scale version of the 17th century Chehel Sotoun in Esfahan, Iran, now used for public programs and artist residencies). The outdoor landscaping has a number of gardens, including a formal Mughal garden inspired by the Shalimar Gardens, as well as terraced water features, a Hawaiian fishpond, tropical gardens and a waterfall, and fabulous vistas of the Pacific Ocean. The museum also hosts two visual artists per year for onsite exhibitions, workshops, and/or lectures. Recently-featured artists have included Hayv Kahraman, Faig Ahmed, Bahia Shehab, and Reem Bassous.  Public tours and programs  Tours of Shangri La originate at the Honolulu Museum of Art, and tickets must be reserved well in advance. Individual access to the museum is not granted. Tours last about two and a-half hours, with one and a-half hours onsite at Shangri La. Tours feature the public rooms of the museum, and portions of the grounds: including the Entry Courtyard with Bahia Shehab's My People mural, the Mughal Garden, the covered lƒÅnai overlooking the Pacific Ocean, and views of the Playhouse/pool/water cascades. The Shangri La Museum of Islamic Art, Culture & Design has a rich calendar of public programs throughout the year, including educational activities, lectures, and performances by the artists in residence, including musicians (such as Alsarah and the Nubatones), dancers (such as Amirah Sackett), comedians (Tanzila 'Taz' Ahmed and Zahra Noorkbakhsh of Good Muslim Bad Muslim), and intellectuals (such as Dr. Lonnie Bunch). Location The Shangri La Museum of Islamic Art, Culture & Design is situated on a oceanfront lot in the exclusive Black Point residential neighborhood near Diamond Head, Hawaii. All tours to Shangri La begin and end at the Honolulu Museum of Art, which occupies near downtown Honolulu.

History Laser lithotripsy was invented at the Wellman Center for Photo medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital in the 1980s to remove impacted urinary stones. Optical fibers carry light pulses that pulverize the stone. Candela licensed the technology and released the first commercial laser lithotripsy system. Initially 504 nm dye lasers were used, then holmium lasers were studied in the 1990s. Procedure A urologist inserts a scope into the urinary tract to locate the stone. The scope may be a cystoscope, ureteroscope, renoscope or nephroscope. An optical fiber is inserted through the working channel of the scope, and laser light is directly emitted to the stone. The stone is fragmented and the remaining pieces are collected in a \\"basket\\" and/or washed out of the urinary tract, along with the finer particulate \\"dust.\\" The procedure is done under either local or general anesthesia and is considered a minimally-invasive procedure. It is widely available in most hospitals in the world.  Comparison  Laser lithotripsy (LL) has been evaluated against Extracorporeal Shock Wave lithotripsy (ESWL), finding both to be safe and effective. ESWL may be safer for small stones (<10 mm), but less effective for 10‚Äì20 mm stones. A 2013 meta-analysis found LL can treat larger stones (> 2 cm) with good stone-free and complication rates. Holmium laser lithotripsy had superior initial success and re-treatment rate compared to extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) in a 2013 trial. The experimental thulium fiber laser (TFL) is being studied as a potential alternative to the holmium:YAG (Ho:YAG) laser for the treatment of kidney stones. The TFL has several potential advantages compared to Ho:YAG laser for lithotripsy, including a four times lower ablation threshold, a near single-mode beam profile, and higher pulse rates, resulting in up to four times as fast ablation rates and faster procedural times. Lasers Pulsed dye lasers have been used with fiber diameters of 200‚Äì550 microns for lithotripsy of biliary and urinary stones. Ho:YAG lasers have wavelength of 2100 nm (infrared) and are used for medical procedures in urology and other areas. They have qualities of CO2 and Nd:Yag lasers, with ablative and coagulation effects. Holmium laser use results in smaller fragments than 320 or 365 micron pulsed dye lasers or electrohydraulic and mechanical methods. Thulium fiber lasers are being investigated.

It is far less expensive to build multiple, full-scale, non-functional boilerplate spacecraft than it is to develop the full system (design, test, redesign, and launch). In this way, boilerplate spacecraft allow components and aspects of cutting-edge aerospace projects to be tested while detailed contracts for the final project are being negotiated. These tests may be used to develop procedures for mating a spacecraft to its launch vehicle, emergency access and egress, maintenance support activities, and various transportation processes. Boilerplate spacecraft are most commonly used to test crewed spacecraft; for example, in the early 1960s, NASA performed many tests using boilerplate Apollo spacecraft atop Saturn I rockets, and Mercury spacecraft atop Atlas rockets (for example Big Joe 1). The engine-less Space Shuttle Enterprise was used as a boilerplate to test launch stack assembly and transport to the launch pad. NASA's now-canceled Constellation program and ongoing Artemis program used boilerplate Orion spacecraft for various testing.  Mercury boilerplates  Mercury boilerplates were manufactured \\"in-house\\" by NASA Langley Research Center technicians prior to McDonnell Aircraft Company building the Mercury spacecraft. The boilerplate capsules were designed and used to test spacecraft recovery systems, and escape tower and rocket motors. Formal tests were done on the test pad at Langley and at Wallops Island using the Little Joe rockets.NASA Mercury History Sections #44 and #47Mercury Project Boilerplates and Little Joe Rockets with Boilerplates =Etymology= The term boilerplate originated from the use of boilerplate steeli.e. sheet steel typically used to manufacture boilers for the construction of test articles/mock-ups. Historically, during the development of the Little Joe series of 7 launch vehicles, there was only one actual boilerplate capsule and it was called such since its conical section was made of steel at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. This capsule was used in a beach abort test, and then subsequently used in the LJ1A flight. However, the term subsequently came to be used for all the prototype capsules (which in their own right were nearly as complicated as the orbital capsules).

BP-1102A  BP-1102 was used for water egress trainer for all Apollo flights, including by the crew of Apollo 11, the first lunar landing mission. It was also adapted for mock-up interior components and used by astronauts to practice routine and emergency exits from the spacecraft. It was then modified again where the interior was set up to be configured either as Apollo/Soyuz or a proposed five-person Skylab Rescue vehicle. With these two conversions, astronauts could train for those special missions. It was finally transferred from NASA to the Smithsonian in 1977, and is displayed now at the Udvar-Hazy Center with the flotation collar and bags that were attached to Columbia (the Apollo 11 Command Module) at the end of its historic mission.Smithsonian NASM: Apollo Boilerplate BP-1210 BP-1210 BP-1210 was used in landing and recovery training and to test flotation devices.

It is now located in Grand Rapids, Michigan as a time capsule.Current Location See BP-1227 photo or Google Street View image. The only certainties about this capsule are that it was returned to the United States at Murmansk early in September 1970 during a visit by the USCG Southwind who returned it to the Naval Air Station, Norfolk, Virginia. There it remained until title was passed to the Smithsonian in April 1976 when it was passed on to Grand Rapids, Michigan to serve as a time capsule. Two official sources ‚Äì the US Navy and the US Coastguard ‚Äì both say that it was lost by an ARRS (Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron) unit training in recovery procedures. A contemporary account of its return quotes a NASA spokesman as saying, \\" ... as far as NASA can determine the object... the Navy lost two years ago.\\"  Space Shuttle boilerplates  SCA during the first free-flight of the Approach and Landing Test programme As part of the Space Shuttle program, a number of boilerplate vehicles were constructed using various materials to undertake key tests of procedures, infrastructure and other elements that would take place during a Shuttle mission. =Facilities Test Article= In 1977, the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) constructed a simple steel and wood orbiter mockup to be used in fit check activities for various elements of the infrastructure needed to support the Space Shuttle, including roadway clearances and crane capabilities, as well as for testing in various buildings and structures used as part of the program, both at the MSFC and at the Kennedy Space Center. The mockup was designed to be the approximate size, shape and weight of an actual orbiter, and allowed these initial tests to be undertaken without using the far more expensive and delicate prototype orbiter, Enterprise. Following its use as a test article, the mockup was stored until 1983, when it was refurbished and modified to more closely resemble an actual orbiter, before being displayed in Tokyo. =Structural Test Article= The Structural Test Article was built as a test vehicle intended for use in initial vibration testing to simulate entire flights. The STA was built as essentially a complete orbiter airframe, but with a mockup of the crew compartment installed, and the thermal insulation only fitted to the forward fuselage. The simulation testing of the STA was undertaken over the course of eleven months following its rollout in February 1978; at the time, it was intended that the prototype orbiter Enterprise would be converted into a full flight ready model, but the cost of undertaking this work, along with a number of design changes that had taken place between Enterprise being rolled out, and the final construction of the first operational orbiter, Columbia, meant that it was decided instead to upgrade the STA into a flight model. This began following the end of the STA testing in January 1979, with the completed orbiter, named as Challenger, rolled out in June 1982. =Prototype= Approach and landing tests In January 1977, the prototype orbiter Enterprise was delivered to Edwards Air Force Base in California for the beginning of its overall test programme, which would encompass flight tests, fit-check and procedures testing of the orbiter, its systems, the facilities and procedures required to launch, fly and land the spacecraft safely. During 1977, Enterprise was used in what was called the Approach and Landing Tests programme of testing, which encompassed mating the orbiter to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft, a modified Boeing 747 to test the taxiing and flight characteristics of the Orbiter / SCA combination. This included flights of the combination in which Enterprise itself was powered up and crewed, to test crew procedures systems in flight, and finally a set of five so-called \\"free- flights\\", with Enterprise jettisoned from the SCA at altitude to land on its own, testing the orbiter's own flying and handling characteristics. Vibration and fit-check tests In March 1978, following its use in flight tests during the ALT program, Enterprise was taken to the MSFC in Huntsville, Alabama for use in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test. This would see Enterprise mated to an empty External Tank and dummy Solid Rocket Boosters, creating a boilerplate version of the complete Space Shuttle stack for the first time. Inside the Dynamic Structural Test Facility at the MSFC, the stack was subjected to a series of vibration tests simulating the various stages that it would be subjected to during launch.NASA Marshall Space Flight Center: Enterprise Boilerplate Tests Following its use at Huntsville, Enterprise was then taken to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, where she was again used in full boilerplate configuration to this time test the procedures of assembling and transporting the stack from the Vehicle Assembly Building to Launch Complex 39, as well as procedures required upon its arrival at the launch pad.NASA Kennedy Space Center: Enterprise on Launch Pad 39A NASA: OV-101 Vertical Tests In 1985, Enterprise was used again for this purpose, this time with the boilerplate configuration used to test the Air Force shuttle facilities at Vandenberg Air Force Base, including a full mating on the SLC-6 launch pad.  Orion boilerplate  =Development= The construction of the first Orion boilerplate,NASA: Orion mockup was a basic mockup prototype to test the assembling sequences and launch procedures at NASA's Langley Research Center while Lockheed aerospace engineers assemble the first rocket motors for the spacecraft's escape tower. The first boilerplate went to Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards, California, for integration of Lockheed's avionics and NASA's developmental flight instrumentation prior to shipment to New Mexico's White Sands Missile Range for the first Orion pad abort test (PA-1) in 2009. On November 20, 2008 a complete test of the abort rockets took place in Utah.NASA: Constellation Abort Test Nov 2008 PA-1 is the first of the six test events in Orion Abort Flight Test subproject. Lockheed Martin Corp. was awarded the contract to build Orion on August 31, 2006. Other boilerplates would be used to test thermal, electromagnetic, audio, mechanical vibration conditions and research studies. These tests for the Orion spacecraft would be done at Plum Brook Station in the agency's Ohio-based Glenn Research Center.A Spiral Stairway to the Moon and Beyond =Photos= Commercial spacecraft boilerplates In the 2010s, several commercially designed space capsules used boilerplate units on the initial launches of new launch vehicles. * The Dragon Spacecraft Qualification Unit was a boilerplate unit launched to orbit on the maiden flight of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, on June 4, 2010.

It stars Adam Sandler and Kevin James as the title characters Chuck and Larry, respectively, two New York City firefighters who pretend to be a gay couple in order to ensure one of their children can receive healthcare; however, things go from bad to worse when an agent decides to verify their story. The film was released in the United States on July 20, 2007, and was Sandler's first role in a Universal Pictures film since Bulletproof in 1996. It grossed $187.1 million against an $85 million budget. Plot Chuck Levine, a womanizing bachelor, and Larry Valentine, a widower struggling to raise his two children, are two veteran New York City firefighters. During a routine sweep of a burned building, a segment of floor collapses on Chuck, but Larry saves his life. Chuck vows to repay Larry in any way possible. Experiencing an epiphany from the incident, Larry tries to increase his life insurance policy. He finds out that a lapse in the paperwork after his wife's death keeps him from naming his children as primary beneficiaries. The representative from the insurance company suggests that Larry find a new spouse so he can name that person as his beneficiary. However, there is no woman in Larry's life that he loves or trusts. Inspired by a newspaper article about domestic partnerships, Larry asks Chuck to enter a civil union with him. Although Chuck declines at first, he is reminded of his debt to Larry and finally agrees, entering a domestic partnership and becoming Larry's primary beneficiary in the event of his death. To their dismay, however, investigators arrive to inquire about their abrupt partnership, suspecting fraud. Chuck and Larry decide to enlist the help of lawyer Alex McDonough, who suggests they have a formal wedding ceremony to prove they are committed. The pair travel to Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada for a quick same-sex marriage at a wedding chapel, and Chuck moves in with Larry and his children. Alex invites the couple to a gay benefit costume party. At the end of the evening, the partygoers are confronted by homophobic protesters. Chuck is provoked into punching their leader, and the incident is picked up by the local news. With their apparent homosexuality and marriage revealed, Chuck and Larry are heckled, and their fellow FDNY firefighters refuse to work with them. Their only ally is Fred G. Duncan, an angry, intimidating firefighter who reveals to Chuck that he is gay, and has not felt comfortable telling anyone. Chuck becomes romantically interested in Alex after the two spend time together, but finds himself unable to get close to her because she thinks he is gay. During a heart-to-heart talk about relationships, the two spontaneously kiss, but Alex, still believing Chuck is gay and married, is shocked and immediately distances herself from Chuck. Meanwhile, city agent Clinton Fitzer arrives to investigate the couple, and the strain on both Larry and Chuck causes them to fight. Larry asserts that Chuck's constant absence to spend time with Alex is jeopardizing their ability to maintain the ruse of their relationship. Chuck tells Larry that he should stop refusing to move on from the death of his wife. Later that evening, a petition circulates to have Chuck and Larry thrown out of the firehouse. Upon discovering it, Larry confronts the crew about personal embarrassments on the job that Chuck and Larry helped them overcome. Afterwards, Chuck and Larry apologize to each other and reconcile their differences. Eventually, numerous women publicly testify to having slept with Chuck in the recent past, and the couple is called into court to defend their marriage against charges of fraud. They are defended by Alex, and their fellow firefighters arrive in support, having realized all that Chuck and Larry have done for them over the years. Fitzer interrogates both men, and eventually demands the pair to kiss to prove that their relationship is physical. Before they do so, Chuck and Larry are interrupted by FDNY Captain Phineas J. Tucker, who reveals their marriage to be a sham and that they are both straight. He emphasizes that the situation reminded people not to be judgmental, and then offers to be arrested as well, since he knew about the false relationship but failed to report it. This prompts each of the other firefighters to claim a role in the wedding in a show of solidarity. Chuck, Larry, and the other firefighters are sent to jail, but they are quickly released after negotiating a deal to provide photos for an AIDS research benefit calendar, and Chuck and Larry keep their benefits. Two months later, Fred and Alex's brother, Kevin, are married in Niagara Falls at the same chapel as Chuck and Larry. At the wedding party (which features musical guest Lance Bass), Larry moves on from the death of his wife and talks to a new woman, while Alex agrees to a dance with Chuck.

Release =Critical response= Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports a 15% approval rating, based on 163 with an average rating is 3.61/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Whether by way of inept comedy or tasteless stereotypes, I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry falters on both levels.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 37 out of 100 based on 33 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. USA Today called it \\"a movie that gives marriage, homosexuality, friendship, firefighters, children and nearly everything else a bad name.\\" The Wall St Journal calls it \\"an insult to gays, straights, men, women, children, African- Americans, Asians, pastors, mailmen, insurance adjusters, firemen, doctors -- and fans of show music.\\" The New York Post called it not an insult to homosexuality but to comedy itself. The Miami Herald was slightly less critical, calling the film \\"funny in the juvenile, crass way we expect.\\" Nathan Lee from the Village Voice wrote a positive review, praising the film for being \\"tremendously savvy in its stupid way\\" and \\"as eloquent as Brokeback Mountain, and even more radical.\\" Controversial critic Armond White championed the film as \\"a modern classic\\" for its \\"ultimate moral lesson‚Äîthat sexuality has absolutely nothing to do with who Chuck and Larry are as people\\". =Box office= Chuck & Larry grossed $34,233,750 and ranked #1 at the domestic box office in its opening weekend, higher than the other opening wide release that weekend, Hairspray, and the previous weekend's #1 film, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. By the end of its run, the film had grossed $120,059,556 domestically and $66,012,658 internationally for a worldwide total of $186,072,214. =Social responses and controversy= The film was screened prior to release for the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD). GLAAD representative Damon Romine told Entertainment Weekly magazine: \\"The movie has some of the expected stereotypes, but in its own disarming way, it's a call for equality and respect\\". According to Alexander Payne, the writer of an initial draft of the film, Sandler took many liberties with his screenplay, \\"Sandler-izing\\" the film, in his own words. At some point, he did not want his name attached to the project.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/oscars/9013788/Oscars-2012-Alexander- Payne-on-The-Descendants.html Critics have also said that the character played by Rob Schneider is a racist caricature by whitewashing, and he was also criticized for donning yellowface.afterelton.com Review of \\"I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry\\" In November 2007, the producers of the Australian film Strange Bedfellows initiated legal action against Universal Studios for copyright violation.Filmmakers take on Hollywood over comedy 'copy' - Film - Entertainment Strange Bedfellows, was released three years before. In comparison, the films have 100 similar plot points. Both movie plots deal with two firemen, who pretend to be a gay couple for financial reasons, are investigated, and then have to deal with the situation with their friends and community. The suit was withdrawn in April 2008 after the producers of Strange Bedfellows received an early draft of Chuck & Larry that predated their film, and they were satisfied that they had not been plagiarized. In January 2020, a member of Chicago's city council cited the film during an argument over a city plan to set aside contracts for gay and transgender owned businesses. Alderman Walter Burnett said, ‚ÄúI think about that movie about the two firemen where they were faking like they were gay‚Ä¶ to get benefits. That‚Äôs a concern of mine. How do you distinguish that?‚Äù =Home media= The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on November 6, 2007. The film was made available for streaming on Netflix in July 2020. Accolades The film received eight Golden Raspberry Award nominations including Worst Picture, Worst Actor (Adam Sandler), Worst Supporting Actor (both Kevin James and Rob Schneider), Worst Supporting Actress (Jessica Biel), Worst Director (Dennis Dugan), Worst Screenplay and Worst Screen Couple (Adam Sandler with either Kevin James or Jessica Biel), but did not win any.

New Threat Upgrade (NTU) was a United States Navy program to improve and modernize the capability of existing cruisers and destroyers equipped with Terrier and Tartar anti-aircraft systems, keeping them in service longer. It was a key component of then-President Ronald Reagan's 600-ship Navy plan. The Program was selected to install and test the Terrier New Threat Upgrade (NTU) Combat System with the improved Standard Missile Two Block II (Extended Range). Testing lasted from October 1981- March 1985. New Threat Upgrade allowed the full use of newer Standard missiles (SM-2ER BlkII w/Mk80 booster) and improved the interoperability of the radar, computer, tracking and engagement systems aboard the ships. The system allows the ships to which it was fitted to time share illumination radars for multiple missile interceptions in a manner similar but far superior to the Aegis Combat System. NTU Combat System also allowed full on Engagement of other ships inbound raids while they laid in silent undetected wait to decimate the inbound raid. Many sources affirm and verify that NTU ships were easily combat superior in most respects to Aegis ships of the same era, particularly in the area of tracking and engagement through high jamming environments at nearly double the range of then current Aegis technology. They were inferior to modern Aegis cruisers in that their berthing, messing, and habitability systems were antiquated and needed constant repair. History The New Threat Upgrade to the Leahy class included massive remodeling of the ship from food service space rehabilitation to a main propulsion system overhaul. Entire systems were removed and replaced, for example the AN/SPS-40 air-search radar was replaced with the AN/SPS-49 air-search radar. In 1988‚Äì90, the Kidd-class destroyers received the New Threat Upgrade, including a new superstructure and heavier mainmast cooperative engagement with Aegis Ticonderoga-class cruisers, which could control the Kidds‚Äô surface-to-air missiles while they remained electronically silent. The Spruance class, the predecessor to and close relative of the Kidd-class, did not received the NTU. However, in response to criticisms that the as-designed weaponry was insufficient, 24 members of the Spruances were upgraded with a 61-cell Vertical Launch System for Tomahawk missiles which granted them much enhanced anti-surface capabilities beyond their original anti-submarine warfare mission. =End of NTU= The Cold War ended shortly after the New Threat Upgrade was initiated. The lower levels of funding available to the United States Navy after the Cold War meant that the NTU upgrade was never applied to all of the intended vessels. The NTU upgrade itself was expensive, although it still overshadowed the capabilities of the expensive purpose-constructed Aegis warship that was not nearly as capable. Many of these ships were retired in the 1990s whether they received the full NTU modification or not; most of these warships built in the 1960s-1970s had high operational costs and manpower requirements (especially those which were nuclear-powered), compared to newer Aegis warships. The USS Texas (CGN-39) was decommissioned during the upgrade, in the midst of her reactor refueling. USS Gridley (CG-21) received NTU in 1991 at a cost of $55 million but was decommissioned in early 1994. Overall, all US Navy ships that received the NTU upgrades were decommissioned within six years of their upgrade, as the Navy chose instead to order new less capable ships with the Aegis weapon system. The Navy also accelerated the retirement of the Spruance and Kidd classes, despite their recent modifications, due to the arrival of the Aegis-equipped Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, which were more effective and cost-efficient.

They were also in Medina during Muhammad's era. Aws and Khazraj are descendants of Azd tribe and were known as Ban≈´ Qayla ( ) in pre-Islamic era.  Early history  Abu Muhammad Al-Hasan Ibn Ahmad Al-Hamdani mentioned that the Banu Khazraj and the Banu Aws settled the area of Yathrib around the 2nd century AD as part of the Pre-Islamic Exodus of Yemen because of the Great Marib Dam damage. However, all sources agree that the Banu Khazraj and Banu Aws became hostile to each other. Jewish chronicles state that they went to war against each other in the Battle of Bu'ath a few years before the Islamic prophet Muhammad migrated to Medina.jewishencyclopedia.com There were three Jewish tribes present in Medina: Banu Qaynuqa, Banu Nadir and Banu Qurayza. During the battle, the Banu Nadir and the Banu Qurayza fought on the side of the Banu Aws, and the Banu Qaynuqa were allied with the Banu Khazraj. The latter were defeated after a long and desperate battle. The Nusaybah clan family of Jerusalem, Custodians of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, are descendants of Banu Khazraj. They arrived in Jerusalem with the 7th-century Islamic conquest. Hijrah The Banu Aus were included in point 30-31 of the Constitution of Medina as allies to the Muslims, being as \\"one nation/community with the Believers\\".http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_MedinaThe Message Abd-Allah ibn Ubaiy, their chief,jewishencyclopedia.com is said to have plotted against Muhammad. The Banu Khazraj and others became known as the Ansar. Military campaigns On 624 Muhammad ordered the assassination of Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf. According to Ibn Ishaq, Muhammad ordered his followers to kill Ka'b because he \\"had gone to Mecca after Badr and inveighed against Muhammad. He also composed verses in which he bewailed the victims of Quraysh who had been killed at Badr. Shortly afterwards he returned to Medina and composed amatory verses of an insulting nature about the Muslim women\\". This killing was carried out by the Banu Aus Uri Rubin, The Assassination of Ka øb b. al-Ashraf, Oriens, Vol. 32. (1990), pp. 65-71.Mubarakpuri, The Sealed Nectar, pp.151-153. (online) When men of the Banu Aus tribe murdered Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf, some Khazraj tribesman including Abdallah ibn Unais went to Muhammad and received permission to put to death the person responsible for the killing of Sallam ibn Abu al-Huqayq, who was killed during the Expedition of 'Abdullah ibn 'Atik.Mubarakpuri, The Sealed Nectar (Free version), p. 204.The foundation of the community By ·π¨abarƒ´, pg 100 Sallam ibn Abu al-Huqayq (Abu Rafi) was a Jew, who helped the troops of the Confederates and provided them with a lot of wealth and supplies, on the one hand Ibn Hajr Asqalani , Fath Al-Bari, p. 7/343. and used to mock Muhammad with his poetry, on the other. When the Muslims had settled their affair with Banu Quraiza; Al-Khazraj tribe, a rival of Al-Aws, asked for Muhammad's permission to kill him (which Muhammad accepted) in order to merit a virtue equal to that of Al-Aws who had killed Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf. The Nasrids in Granada  Alhambra, Court of the Lions built by the Nasrid sultans In 1228, Ibn al-Ahmar gathered the remains of the Muslim population cornered in Granada and established al-Mamlika al- Nasria derived from the Ansar of Medina whom the Nasrids trace their lineage to. With the Reconquista in full swing after the conquest of Cordoba in 1236, the Nasrids aligned themselves with Ferdinand III of Castile, officially becoming a tributary state in 1238. The state officially becoming the Kingdom of Granada in 1238. The Nasrids had to turn their backs against the Muslims of Cordoba and Seville in order to survive the reconquest. Initially the kingdom of Granada linked the commercial routes from Europe with those of the Maghreb. The territory constantly shrank, however, and by 1492, Granada controlled only a small territory on the Mediterranean coast. Arabic was the official language, and was the mother tongue of the majority of the population. Granada was held as a vassal to Castille for many decades, and provided trade links with the Muslim world, particularly the gold trade with the sub-saharan areas south of Africa. The Nasrids also provided troops for Castille while the kingdom was also a source of mercenary fighters from North African Zenata tribes. However, Portugal discovered direct the African trade routes by sailing around the coast of West Africa. Thus Granada became less and less important for Castille and with the unification of Castille and Aragon in 1479, those kingdoms set their sights on conquering Granada and Navarre. On January 2, 1492, the last Muslim leader, Muhammad XII, known as Boabdil to the Spanish, surrendered complete control of Granada, to Ferdinand and Isabella, Los Reyes Cat√≥licos (\\"The Catholic Monarchs\\"), after the city was besieged.

Research examining this phenomenon draws on a variety of social science disciplines including psychology, anthropology, political science, sociology, and communications. The stated objectives of this research are both to understand how values shape political conflict over facts (like whether climate change exists, whether gun control increases crime, whether vaccination of school girls for HPV threatens their health) and to promote effective deliberative strategies for resolving such conflicts consistent with sound empirical data. Theory and evidence The cultural cognition hypothesis holds that individuals are motivated by a variety of psychological processes to form beliefs about putatively dangerous activities that match their cultural evaluations of them. Persons who subscribe to relatively individualistic values, for example, tend to value commerce and industry and are inclined to disbelieve that such activities pose serious environmental risks. Persons who subscribe to relatively egalitarian and communitarian values, in contrast, readily credit claims of environmental risks, which is consistent with their moral suspicion of commerce and industry as sources of inequality and symbols of excessive self-seeking. Scholars have furnished two types of evidence to support the cultural cognition hypothesis. The first consists of general survey data that suggest that individuals‚Äô values more strongly predict their risk perceptions than do other characteristics such as race, gender, economic status, and political orientations. The second type of evidence consists in experiments that identify discrete psychological processes that connect individuals‚Äô values to their beliefs about risk and related facts. Such experiments suggest, for example, that individuals selectively credit or dismiss information in a manner that reinforces beliefs congenial to their values. They also show that individuals tend to be more persuaded by policy experts perceived to hold values similar to their own rather than by ones perceived to hold values different from them. Such processes, the experiments suggest, often result in divisive forms of cultural conflict over facts, but can also be managed in fashions that reduce such disagreement. Cultural cognition project at Yale Law School Funded by governmental and private foundation grants, much of the work on cultural cognition has been performed by an interdisciplinary group of scholars affiliated with the Cultural Cognition Project.. There are currently over a dozen project members from a variety of universities. Two members of the project‚ÄîDan Kahan and Douglas Kysar‚Äîare Yale Law School faculty, although other members (such as Donald Braman of George Washington University Law School and Geoffrey Cohen of Stanford University) were previously affiliated with Yale Law School or Yale University. Students from Yale University also contribute to Project research. Significant findings =Science comprehension and cultural polarization= A study conducted by Cultural Cognition Project researchers (using a nationally representative U.S. sample) found that ordinary members of the public do not become more concerned about climate change as their science comprehension increases. Instead, the degree of polarization among cultural groups with opposing predispositions increases. =Nanotechnology= The Cultural Cognition Project has conducted a series of studies on public perceptions of nanotechnology risks and benefits. Combining survey and experimental methods, the studies present evidence that individuals culturally predisposed to be skeptical of environmental risks are both more likely to seek out information on nanotechnology and more likely to infer from that information that nanotechnology‚Äôs benefits will outweigh its risks. Individuals culturally predisposed to credit environmental risks construe that same information, when exposed to it in the lab, as implying that nanotechnology‚Äôs risks will predominate. The studies also present evidence that individuals tend to credit expert information on nanotechnology‚Äîregardless of its content‚Äîbased on whether they share the perceived cultural values of the expert communicator. The studies were issued by the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, one of the research sponsors. =\\"Scientific consensus\\"= The same dynamics that motivate individuals of diverse cultural outlooks to form competing perceptions of risks are likely to cause them to form opposing perceptions of \\"scientific consensus\\", cultural cognition researchers have concluded. In an experimental study, the researchers found that subjects were substantially more likely to count a scientist (of elite credentials) as an \\"expert\\" in his field of study when the scientist was depicted as taking a position consistent with the one associated with the subjects' cultural predispositions than when that scientist took a contrary position. A related survey showed that members of opposed cultural groups hold highly divergent impressions of what most scientific experts believe on various matters, a finding consistent with the ubiquity of culturally biased recognition of who counts as an \\"expert\\". Across a range of diverse risks (including climate change, nuclear waste disposal, and private handgun possession), members of no particular cultural group, the study found, were more likely than any other to hold perceptions of scientific consensus that consistently matched those adopted in \\"expert consensus reports\\" issued by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. =Law= Scholars have also applied the cultural cognition of risk to legal issues. One such study examined how individuals reacted to a videotape of a high-speed police chase. In Scott v. Harris,550 U.S. 372 (2007). the U.S. Supreme Court (by a vote of 8-1) had held that no reasonable jury could view the tape and fail to find that the driver posed a lethal risk to the public large enough to justify deadly force by the police (namely, ramming the fleeing driver's vehicle, causing it to crash). The majority of study subjects agreed with the Court, but there were significant divisions along cultural lines. Other studies have found that individuals' cultural worldviews influence their perceptions of consent in an acquaintance or date rape scenario, and of the imminence of violence and other facts in self-defense cases involving either battered women or interracial confrontations. Relationship to other risk perception theories Cultural cognition is a descendant of two other theories of risk perception. The first is the cultural theory of risk associated with anthropologist Mary Douglas and political scientist Aaron Wildavsky. The cultural cognition hypothesis is derived from Douglas and Wildavsky's claim, advanced most notably in their controversial book Risk and Culture: An Essay on the Selection of Technical and Environmental Dangers (1982), that individuals selectively attend to risks in a manner that expresses and reinforces their preferred way of life. Cultural cognition researchers, along with other scholars who have investigated Douglas and Wildavsky's theory empirically,For example, , , and use attitudinal scales that reflect Douglas's worldview typology. That typology characterizes worldviews, or preferences about how society should be organized, along two cross-cutting dimensions: \\"group\\", which refers to how individualistic or group-oriented a society should be; and \\"grid\\", which refers to how hierarchical or egalitarian a society should be. The second theory is the \\"psychometric paradigm\\", to which Paul Slovic, a member of the Cultural Cognition Project, has made significant contributions. The psychometric paradigm links risk perceptions to various cognitive and social mechanisms that generally evade simpler, rational choice models associated with economics. Cultural cognition theory posits that these mechanisms mediate between, or connect, individuals' cultural values to their perceptions of risk and other policy-relevant beliefs. Combining the cultural theory of risk and the psychometric paradigm, cultural cognition, its exponents claim, remedies difficulties with each. The mechanisms featured in the psychometric paradigm (and in social psychology generally) furnish a cogent explanation of why individuals adopt states of mind that fit and promote the aims of groups, including ones featured in Douglas‚Äôs culture theory. They do so, moreover, in a manner that avoids \\"functionalism,\\" a criticized form of analysis that identifies group interests, rather than individual ones, as a cause for human action. At the same time cultural theory, by asserting the orienting role of values, explains how the mechanisms featured in the psychometric paradigm can result in differences in risk perception among persons who hold different values. The interrelationship between individual values and perceptions of risk also calls into doubt the depiction of risk perceptions deriving from these mechanisms as products of irrationality or cognitive defect. Criticisms Cultural cognition has been subjected to criticisms from a variety of sources. The rational choice economists , as well as the psychologist have suggested that the theory (and others based on the cultural theory of risk generally) explain only a small fraction of the variation in popular risk perceptions. Mary Douglas herself has criticized cultural cognition for a conception of values that is too tightly modeled on American political disputes and that implicitly disparages the \\"hierarchical\\" worldview. Finally, some scholars who emphasize elements of the psychometric paradigm suggest that the influence of cultural values on risk perceptions is best understood as simply an additional source of interference with the rational processing of information.

The Wall is the local name given to the area between North Cronulla Beach and Elouera. The Alley is the local name given to the permanent rip current located at the southern end of North Cronulla Beach. North Cronulla Surf Life Saving Club The North Cronulla Surf Life Saving Club was established by a group of local residents who were concerned about the safety of visitors to the beach. The first patrol of the beach was in 1925, using the reel, line and belt as their only form of rescue equipment. The first clubhouse, which opened in 1926, was a small weatherboard building on the beach, at the end of The Kingsway. Wave action forced club members to move the clubhouse from the beach into Dunningham Park in 1932. The rock pools between Cronulla and North Cronulla were built and opened the same year. A new, three storey cement rendered clubhouse was opened in 1937, said to be the finest in Australia. The Army‚Äôs beach fortifications during World War II affected the seawall foundations and the clubhouse had to be demolished after heavy seas in 1946. In 1950, North Cronulla lost one of its greatest swimming champions, Club Captain Major James 'Jim' Perryman who was attempting to rescue a 16-year-old woman from the surf when he was pulled under by the weight of seaweed on his rescue line. The woman was pulled to safety by another club member but Perryman, who was reeled to shore, could not be revived. A new clubhouse opened later that year and a pool later added to the surf club complex was named after Perryman. In 75 years, North Cronulla members conducted more than 11,000 rescues. Today, North Cronulla has approximately 500 senior and 250 junior members. History Cronulla is derived from an Aboriginal word kurranulla, meaning 'place of pink seashells'.

He was a representative to the Congress of Tucum√°n of 9 July 1816 which declared the Independence of Argentina, and is credited with the foundation of the important sugar cane industry in Tucum√°n Province. Colombres was born in San Miguel de Tucum√°n into an influential family and became a cleric in August 1803 in Catamarca and a Doctor in Canon Law at the University of San Carlos in C√≥rdoba. Colombres was elected by Catamarca Province to the Tucum√°n Congress in 1816, having served as a parish priest in Piedra Blanca in that province. After independence, he participated in the League of the North and consequently had to live in exile in Livi-Livi close to Tupiza, Bolivia, until the fall of Juan Manuel de Rosas. He returned to Tucum√°n and became a priest in the cathedral. He was a senior cleric in the Salta diocese, for a period leading the diocese which had no bishop appointed since 1830. As governor of the diocese he commissioned the new Salta Cathedral. In 1858 Colombres was appointed Bishop of Salta on the suggestion of Justo Jos√© de Urquiza but died less than two months later before being consecrated. Although sugar cane had been brought to northern Argentina by the Jesuits, Colombres started growing it on his land in 1821 and introduced the techniques to make its cultivation an industry and income generator, with the first mill. Sugar production is still, as of 2006, one of Tucum√°n's principal industries. His house in Tucum√°n, around which the city's extensive Ninth of July Park was developed in 1910, is now the Museum of the Sugar Industry and a National Historic Monument. His birthplace close to the city's central square is now the Folklore Museum.

He is known for his realist novels that describe the life of the poor in Turkey.  Biography  Orhan Kemal was born in Adana, Ceyhan, on 15 September 1914. He was the son of Abd√ºlkadir Kemali Bey, who was a Member of Parliament and Minister, and Azime Hanƒ±m, who was an intellectual secondary school graduate. Kemal's father was obliged to flee Turkey for Syria, due to his party being suspected of involvement in a recent revolt, where Kemal remained with him for a year before returning to Adana in 1932. Kemal worked as a labourer, a weaver and as a clerk in a cotton mill. While doing his military service in 1938 his political opinions led to his being sentenced to a 5-year term of imprisonment. The charges included \\"reading the works of Maxim Gorky and Nazim Hikmet\\" and \\"propagandising for foreign regimes and encouraging revolt\\". While in prison in Bursa he was the cellmate of Hikmet, who was his major literary influence. He had been writing poems until he met Hikmet. With his encouragement, he switched to stories. After being released from prison in 1943 he returned to Adana, working as a labourer, and beginning to publish his writings. Although he started as a writer of poetry he soon began to publish stories, from 1943 under the adopted name Orhan Kemal. Following the birth of his third child (of four) Kemal moved his family to Istanbul in 1951 where he worked again as a labourer and then from 1951 as a clerk at the Tuberculosis Foundation, living with little money and all the time writing. He was arrested again in 1966 for \\"forming a communist propagandist cell\\" but was released two months later after the charges could not be substantiated. Orhan Kemal died on June 2, 1970 in a hospital in Sofia, due to intracranial hemorrhage, in 1970, while visiting Bulgaria upon the invitation of the Bulgarian Writers Union. He is interred in Zincirlikuyu Cemetery, Istanbul. Works Orhan Kemal's stories and novels generally depict the lives of ordinary working people trying to hold on to their dignity in conditions of poverty or deprivation. His first poem was published in Yedig√ºn under the name of Ra≈üit Kemal (Duvarlar 25.04.1939) Further poems written under the same pen name are Yedig√ºn and Yeni Mecmua 1940. On meeting Nazƒ±m Hikmet, Kemal wrote under the name of \\"Orhan Ra≈üit\\" (Yeni Edebiyat 1941) Impressed by Nazƒ±m Hikmet, Kemal concentrated on stories as opposed to poems. His first story, Bir Yƒ±lba≈üƒ± Macerasƒ±, was published in 1941. In 1942 he adopted the name Orhan Kemal when writing stories and poems in Y√ºr√ºy√º≈ü. He found fame through stories in Varlƒ±k in 1944, his first collection of short stories Ekmek Kavgasƒ±, and first novel Baba Evi, was published in 1949. Early works depicted characters form the immigrant quarters of Adana where Kemal described the social structure, worker-employer relationships and the daily struggles of ordinary people in industrialised Turkey. He aimed to present an optimistic view through the heroes of his stories. He never changed his simple expositional style and thus became one of the most skilful names of Turkish stories and novels. He also wrote film scripts and plays including ƒ∞spinozlar and Karde≈ü Payƒ±. Dramatisations have been made of his novels and stories including Murtaza, Eskici D√ºkkanƒ±. His play about life in prison in the 1940s 72.Koƒüu≈ü (Cell 72) has been made as a feature film twice, most recently in 2011, starring well- known actors H√ºlya Av≈üar and Yavuz Bing√∂l. He also wrote a story named Hanimin Ciftligi (English, Lady's farm) which was a major success in Turkish history of soap operas. Recognition The Orhan Kemal Literature Museum and library dedicated to Kemal and his work is to be found in the modest flat in which he lived at 30 Akarsu Caddesi, Cihangir, Istanbul. After his death a literary award was established in his name, the Orhan Kemal Novel Prize, given since 1972. His 100th birth anniversary was celebrated in 2014.http://orhankemal.org/ On Jan 7th 2015, √áukurova Municipality Cultural Centre at his place of birth, Adana, was renamed the Orhan Kemal Cultural Centre.

A Polish stronghold existed in present-day Bia≈Ça, and in the 12th-13th century it was already a seat of local castellans. Bia≈Ça was located on a trade route connecting Krak√≥w and Nysa, and various crafts developed. As a result of the fragmentation of Poland, it was part of the duchies of Silesia, Duchy of Opole, Niemodlin and Ole≈õnica, and remained ruled by local Polish dukes of the Piast dynasty until 1532, although in 1327 it fell under the suzerainty of Bohemia. In the southwestern corner of their domain, the dukes of Opole built a castle, named Bia≈Ça (in medieval documents mentioned under the Latinized name Bela), on the Bia≈Ça river. This castle was the seat of power of a local mayor of the palace. Around the foot of the castle, a village, settled by new colonists, including Germans, the seat of its local parish, served as a setting-off point for further settlement in the region, which was densely forested and bordered Moravia. The village was first mentioned historically in 1225. In 1270 Bia≈Ça, was a county seat, and it was granted town rights in 1311, later modeled on ≈öroda ≈ölƒÖska and Wroc≈Çaw. Around the year 1270, a new settlement, named Zolez and later Z√ºlz, was founded between castle and the small surrounding village. Its construction was highly traditional. The town was walled after its completion, with two gates being constructed to allow access. A marketplace was built in the center of the town as well. Around this time, several surrounding municipalities changed their names. Bia≈Ça, named for the castle, became the Old Town, while the new settlement, 4 km (2 mi) to the east, was already named Z√ºlz, by the colonists, and was renamed Alt Z√ºlz (English: Old Z√ºlz). The church at Alt Z√ºlz, which had been the main church in the area, was made a satellite church of a new, larger city church, built in 1400 by local Polish dukes. Z√ºlz became the seat of a vogt in 1311. In 1428 it was plundered by the Hussites. In 1502 and 1503 Duke Jan II the Good granted various new privileges to the town. Renaissance castle In 1335, the town became a Presbyterium, a local seat of power of the Roman Catholic Church. However, this was not permanent. After the death of the last duke of Opole, Jan II the Good in 1532, the town was incorporated to the Habsburg-ruled Kingdom of Bohemia and the Habsburgs soon mortgaged the town's ecclesiastical position to pay off debts. Also by the end of the 14th century, the city had acquired a large Jewish population. Over the next 200 years, the town passed into the possession of various groups, including the barons of Pr√≥szk√≥w. This was significant, as under the rule of the barons, Z√ºlz was only one of two Silesian cities, the other being G≈Çog√≥w, which did not expel their Jewish populations. Under a 1601 petition of the barons, Bohemian King Rudolf II extended special protective privileges to the Jewish population of Z√ºlz. In 1645 along with Opole and Racib√≥rz it returned to Poland under the House of Vasa, and in 1666 it fell to Bohemia again. Despite being outside of Polish rule after 1666, in the late 17th century church services in Polish were still held in Bia≈Ça and surrounding villages. =Modern era= The city was doubly devastated in the 1630s, as both the Thirty Years' War and the Black Death killed nearly the entire population of the town. To mark the terrible occurrence, a memorial remembering those who died around that time was constructed. Special commercial rights granted to the city in 1699 allowed local Jews to do business with people from Bohemia, Silesia, and the rest of Poland, giving them rights equal to local Christian merchants. These rights served as the impetus for a strong Jewish immigration into Z√ºlz, mainly in the 18th century. This earned the city the nickname Judenz√ºlz, although the local Jewish community had given the town another nickname, the Hebrew Makom Zadik (English: Place of the Protected). After the 1742 partition of Silesia, Z√ºlz was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia. The main effect of this came several decades later, in the form of an emancipation decree issued by Frederick William III. This proclamation ended the second-class status of Jews. Many Jews took this opportunity and moved to larger cities, leaving Z√ºlz. This emigration was so strong that by 1914, the Jewish community in Z√ºlz was largely defunct. At the same time the indigenous Polish population was subject to increasing Germanisation policies. Due to the lack of Polish schools, local Poles sent their children to schools in so-called Congress Poland in the Russian Partition of Poland. Polish activist and publicist , who was a Polish teacher in the town in the 1870s, became the subject of an investigation by the local Prussian administration and police for writing about this practice in the Gazeta Toru≈Ñska, a major Polish newspaper in the Prussian Partition of Poland. Early 20th-century view of the train station The castle, like the town, passed through the ownership of many different groups. In 1727, the castle was still in the possession of the barons of Pr√≥szk√≥w (then Proskau), who began a restoration of both the castle and its architecturally notable 16th-century cloister. In 1748, the castle passed into the ownership of Bartolomaius von Oderfeld, as he was the new ruler of the area. In 1756, the castle became the property of count Rudolf Matuszka from Bohemia and his descendants, until the breakup of the local administrative units to which Z√ºlz belonged, in 1841. The city of Z√ºlz purchased the castle outright in 1874, which was then used for city business and administration until 1923. The castle became a girls' school in 1926. The city was connected to the railroad network on October 22, 1896, with the completion of a 12 km (7 mi) railroad spur from the nearby town of Prudnik. Another connection, a 31 km (16 mi) spur connecting the city to the northeast with the town of Gogolin, was completed on December 4 of the same year. After World War II, the town, which had belonged to Germany since 1816, passed again to Poland and its original name Bia≈Ça was restored. In accordance to the Potsdam Agreement.

Life He is identified with the Richard Clifton who, on 12 February 1585, was instituted to the vicarage of Marnham, near Newark, and on 11 July 1586 to the rectory of All Saints' Church, Babworth, near Retford, and not very far from Scrooby. The separatist church in Nottinghamshire, which was probably Clyfton's church, ordinarily met in William Brewster's house at Scrooby.:s:Clifton, Richard (DNB00) John Robinson attached himself to Clyfton's church, and was shortly afterwards chosen his assistant in the ministry; and after Clyfton's move to the Netherlands became sole pastor of the church. William Bradford belonged to this congregation. Bradford had first encountered Clifton when he was in Scrooby.PBS \\"American Experience\\" \\"The Pilgrims\\" (2015), at approximately 18:30 Clifton emigrated to Amsterdam in August 1608. He joined other exiles there, and attached himself to the church of which Francis Johnson was pastor. He was, perhaps, on Henry Ainsworth's departure (16 December 1610) made teacher among them. William Bradford describes him as a \\"grave and fatherly old man when he left England, having a great white beard\\". Clifton died at Amsterdam on 20 May 1616, and is buried in the Zuiderkerk. Works At Amsterdam Clyfton was engaged in several bitter controversies. Having renounced the principles of rigid separation he became one of the most violent adversaries of John Smyth, and published, A Plea for Infants and elder People concerning their Baptisme. Or a Processe of the Passages between M. Iohn Smyth and Richard Clifton, Amsterdam, 1610. He also wrote An Advertisement concerning a book lately published by Christopher Lawne and others, against the Exiled English Church at Amsterdam, 1612. The book attacked is The prophane Schism of the Brownists or Separatists, with the impiety, dissensions, lewd and abominable vices of that impure Sect, discovered, 1612. Henry Ainsworth published An Animadversion to Mr. Richard Clyftons Advertisement, Amsterdam, 1613. Notes He was also a member and leader of the pilgrims. He led a congregation with William Brewster.Separatist pastor of Babworth's All Saints' Paris Church, England. Under his teaching, the Pilgrim movement began which would culminate in the sailing of the Pilgrims to America on the Mayflower. Pastor of young William Bradford. Clyfton was one of the most effective authors for the Pilgrim Separatists. The church where he is buried has been deconsecrated and is now used by the city of Amsterdam as an exposition center.The English Separatist congregation that became the core of the Pilgrim movement had two pastors. Neither saw the \\"promised land\\" of Plymouth Colony. The second pastor, John Robinson, was with the congregation (although not yet pastor) when they moved from England to Holland in search of religious freedom. He was a strong proponent of the group's later move from Holland to America, where they would reestablish their church in the new Plymouth Colony. When it was determined that only a minority of his congregation would voyage on the Mayflower, however, Robinson remained behind in Holland. He intended to make the Atlantic crossing with the rest of his flock as soon as it was financially possible. It was not to be. Robinson died in 1624 in Leiden, never having seen Plymouth Colony. John Robinson did, however, rejoice from afar in the founding of Plymouth. And, even though they were separated by the Atlantic Ocean, Robinson in Leiden and that portion of his flock that had emigrated to Plymouth remained connected. The colonists continued to regard Robinson as their spiritual leader. His advice was sought - and received - by letter. Robinson's wisdom and flexibility, as reflected in the character of early Plymouth Colony, are widely regarded as significant elements in the Colony's survival. Robinson's predecessor as pastor of the Pilgrim group is often overlooked. John Robinson was not, in fact, the founder of the original congregation. Instead, he joined a congregation that was already gathered around Richard Clyfton. William Bradford describes how the Separatists in the area of England known today as \\"Pilgrim Country\\" (Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire and Yorkshire) formed themselves into two distinct churches. One was the church gathered at Gainsborough in Lincolnshire (John Smyth became their pastor). The other was the church gathered first at Babworth and then at Scrooby in Nottinghamshire, about ten miles from Gainsborough. This Babworth/Scrooby congregation (which would eventually become the Pilgrim church) was under the leadership of Richard Clyfton. \\"In one of these churches [Gainsborough]‚Ä¶ was Mr. John Smith, a man of able gifts and a good preacher, who afterwards was chosen their pastor. But these afterwards falling into some errors in the Low Countries [The Netherlands], there (for the most part) buried themselves and their names. But in this other church [Babworth/Scrooby]‚Ä¶besides other worthy men, was Mr. Richard Clyfton, a grave and reverend preacher, who by his pains and diligence had done much good, and under God had been a means of the conversion of many. And also that famous and worthy man Mr. John Robinson, who afterwards was their pastor for many years, till the Lord took him away by death. Also Mr. William Brewster‚Ä¶\\" It was the preaching of Richard Clyfton and the inspiration he provided to William Brewster and William Bradford that launched the \\"Pilgrim adventure.\\" Richard Clyfton was born around 1553 near the Nottinghamshire village of Babworth but left to attend Cambridge University, a hotbed of dissenting theology. He returned home an ordained minister in 1586 and was named pastor of Babworth‚Äôs All Saints Church. His position as pastor provided Clyfton with a \\"living\\" and he was now able to marry. He and his wife Anne had three sons and three daughters, all born at Babworth. The three daughters died in infancy or childhood, but the three Clyfton sons survived. Sometime in the 1590s, Clyfton began to preach dissenting religious views and to conduct services using prayers that were not in the officially authorized Book of Prayers. He soon drew an audience from the surrounding towns and villages. William Brewster, living six or seven miles away in Scrooby, heard Clyfton preach. Brewster joined Clyfton's Babworth congregation, walking by paths through the fields to attend services every Sunday morning and returning by foot to Scrooby late every Sunday afternoon. Several years later, around 1602, young William Bradford, who was living in Austerfield (a Yorkshire village some ten miles from Babworth), also, according to Cotton Mather \\"came to enjoy Mr. Richard Clifton's illuminating ministry.\\" The path from William Bradford‚Äôs home in Austerfield to Richard Clyfton‚Äôs church in Babworth went by William Brewster‚Äôs home in Scrooby. The two men - Bradford a lonely and intellectual teenager and Brewster a settled older family man - walked together and undoubtedly learned each other's minds and characters. -By Grizzell References * External links * The Story of the Pilgrim Fathers, 1606-1623 A.

Finley. It was originally published in 1973. Finley interprets the economy from 1000 BC to 500 AD sociologically, instead of using economic models (like for example Michael Rostovtzeff). Finley attempted to prove that the ancient economy was largely a byproduct of status. In other words, economic systems were not interdependent, they were embedded in status positions. The analysis owes some debt to sociologists such as Max Weber and Karl Polanyi. Summary Finley represented the side of the \\"primitivists\\" where he argued that the economies of Ancient Greece and Rome differed wildly from how the economies of the Western world function today. The modernists, on the contrary, believed that the ancient economy resembles in many ways the way it functions in modern Western democratic states, where economic laws such as supply and demand functioned in the same ways then as it does now. To show how the economies of Ancient Greece and Rome differed from our times, he first examines how the Ancients lacked even the concept of an \\"economy\\" in the way we refer to it in our own times. Economy derives from a Greek word, Œø·º∞Œ∫ŒøŒΩœåŒºŒøœÇ, \\"one who manages a household\\". The household was the most important economic unit. Of course, they mined, taxed, and traded, but what the Ancients did not do was to combine all their commercial activities into an overarching sub-system of society, a giant marketplace where the means of production and distribution responded to market forces such as the cost of labour, supply and demand, trade routes, etc. Moreover, Finley takes the fact that the Ancient Greeks and Romans did not have a sophisticated accounting system as well as how imprecise or carefree they are about numerical data to imply the lack of an economy resembling Western modern ones that place exorbitant demands on numerical computations and precise accounting records. He also deals with the roles of orders and status. He argues that because the ancients placed so much emphasis on status, which heavily regulated what commercial activities was acceptable for those in the upper orders and well as the lower ones, their economy differed from any modern economy where everyone was free and able to participate in whatever legal commercial enterprise. Finley also discusses the institution of slavery which was very prominent in the Ancient world. The relationship between master and slave was complex and even among slaves, there was a diversity of societal rankings. Yet despite this complexity, Finley shows how slavery provided free labour that at times had to be curtailed in order to provide work for the native artisans. Slavery heavily influenced the value placed on labour and certain jobs. Thus, the distribution of labour as well as the means of production that one sees in the ancient economy was different from how modern economies function where human capital plays a role in determinant of price as well as on supply. Another relationship Finley discusses is the way the Ancients viewed the value of land. The ownership of a piece of land for the Ancient Greeks and Romans was not seen as a capital investment where profits could be obtained from the growing and selling of crops, but used as showpieces to enhance one's status as well as something that was inherently desirable from a traditional stand- point where economics played no part. To illustrate this, Finley turns to one of Pliny's letters where he writes that he will have to borrow money to buy more land. In the letter, Pliny does not discuss if this new purchase is an economically wise one in terms of the profits that can be derived from it. The last part of the book, Finley discusses the discrepancies between life in the urban and rural settings. He also writes about how government forces did not play a role in managing the economy and treasury in the same ways modern governments are expected to do in most Western economies. The book has had such an impact on classical scholarship that the views brought forward in The Ancient Economy has been labeled \\"the Finley/Polanyi orthodox\\"Silver, Morris. \\"Review of The Ancient Economy, edited by Walter Scheidel and Sitta von Reden\\", Economic History Services, January 3, 2003.

It is the third clock on that spot and dates from the time of the first French possession of the city (1681‚Äì1870). The first clock had been built in the 14th century, the second in the 16th century, when Strasbourg was a Free imperial city of the Holy Roman Empire. The current, third clock dates from 1843. Its main features, besides the automata, are a perpetual calendar (including a computus), an orrery (planetary dial), a display of the real position of the Sun and the Moon, and solar and lunar eclipses. The main attraction is the procession of the 18 inch high figures of Christ and the Apostles, which occurs every day at solar noon, while the life-size cock crows thrice. Clocks =First clock= The Third of its kind against the south transept. The name of its maker is not known. This clock was known as the \\"Three Kings clock\\" and had several automata. One of them was the gilded rooster, later reused in the second clock and which now is part of the collections of the Strasbourg Museum for Decorative Arts and is considered the oldest preserved automaton worldwide.Coq automate , www.framemuseums.org This bird, a symbol of Christ's passion, was made of iron, copper, and wood. At noon it flapped its wings and spread out its feathers. It also opened its beak, put out its tongue, and by means of a bellows and a reed, crowed. In the top compartment at noon, to the sound of a small carillon, the Three Kings bowed before the figure of The Virgin Mary and the Christ Child. The clock most certainly had an astrolabe dial and a calendar dial. It was standing on the wall opposite the current clock, and a staircase led to its various levels. Supports for former balconies can still be seen today, and suggest that the height of the clock was about 18 m (59'), with a width of about 7.70 m (25') at the base. At the base a painted figure of a zodiacal man showed the relationship between the signs of the zodiac and parts of the human body. There is also a big circle engraved in the wall, but this circle is not a remnant of the first clock. It was added at a later stage, for some unclarified reason. The entire structure was dismantled in 1572‚Äì4 when the second and even more ambitious clock was mounted on the opposite wall of the south transept. =Second clock= The first clock stopped working and a new one was started in the 16th century. It was designed by the mathematician Christian Herlin. During a first phase, the stone case and the staircase were built, around 1547, and the dial and iron framework were being constructed when work halted, due to the various political problems - the cathedral became Catholic - and also due to the deaths of Herlin and his associates. Construction was resumed in 1571 by Conrad Dasypodius, a pupil of and successor to Herlin. Dasypodius enrolled the Swiss clockmakers Isaac Habrecht and Josia Habrecht, as well as the astronomer and musician David Wolckenstein, and Swiss artists Tobias Stimmer and his brother Josias. The clock was completed in 1574. This clock was remarkable both for its complexity as an astronomical device and for the range and richness of its decorations and accessories. As well as the many dials and indicators - the calendar dial, the astrolabe, the indicators for planets, and eclipses - the clock was also well endowed with paintings, moving statues, automata, and musical entertainment in the form of a six tune carillon. The Stimmers painted large panels that depicted the three Fates, Urania, Colossus, Nicolaus Copernicus, and various sacred themes, including the Creation, the resurrection of the Dead, the last judgment, and the rewards of virtue and vice. At the base of a clock there was an 86 cm (34\\") diameter celestial globe, accompanied by the figure of a pelican. The globe was connected to the clock movement, and set for the meridian of Strasbourg. A popular feature of the new clock was the golden cockerel, a relic of the first clock, which perched on the top of the cupola and entertained the onlookers at noon every day until 1640, when it was struck by lightning. Most of the works are still preserved in the Museum of Decorative Arts. =Third clock= The second clock stopped working around 1788 and stood still until 1838, when Jean-Baptiste Schwilgu√© (1776‚Äì1856) started to build the current clock. He designed new mechanisms to replace the old ones and which were meant to be state of the art. Schwilgu√© had wanted to work on the clock since his boyhood, but he only got the contract 50 years later. In the meantime, he had become acquainted with clockmaking, mathematics, and mechanics. He spent one year preparing his 30 workers before actually starting construction. Then, construction lasted from 1838 until June 24, 1843. The clock, however, was inaugurated on December 31, 1842. The gold hands of the clock show mean solar time, or \\"temps moyen\\"; the silver hands show Central European Time, labelled \\"heure publique\\". In winter, mean solar time is approximately 30¬Ω minutes behind Central European Time. This clock contains probably the first perpetual mechanical Gregorian computus, designed by Schwilgu√© in 1816. In the 1970s, Fr√©d√©ric Klinghammer built a reduced replica of it. Model In 1887, a 25-year-old Sydney watchmaker named Richard Smith built a working model of the third clock in the scale 1:5. Having never seen the original, Smith had to work from a pamphlet which described its timekeeping and astronomical functions. This model is in the collection of the Powerhouse Museum, Sydney, Australia.

No. NYO‚Äî112 Even though it is more stable than elemental radium, radium bromide is still extremely toxic, and can explode under certain conditions.Kirby,H.W; Salutsky, Murrell L. The Radiochemistry of Radium. Energy Citations Database Dec 1964. History After the Curies discovered radium (in the form of radium chloride) in 1898, scientists began to isolate radium on an industrial scale, with the intent of using it for radiotherapy treatments. Radium salts, including radium bromide, were most often used by placing the chemical in a tube that was then passed over or inserted into diseased tissue in the body. Many of the first scientists to try to determine radium's uses were affected by their exposure to the radioactive material. Pierre Curie went so far as to self-inflict a severe chemical skin reaction by applying a radium source directly to his forearm, which ultimately created a skin lesion.Dutreix, Jean; Pierquin, Bernard; Tubiana, Maurice. The Hazy Dawn of Brachytherapy. Radiotherapy and Oncology (49) 1998 223-232 All types of therapeutic tests were performed for different skin diseases including eczema, lichen and psoriasis. Later, it was hypothesized that radium could be used to treat cancerous diseases. However, during this time frame, radium also gained popularity among pseudoscientific \\"health remedy\\" industries, which promoted radium as an essential element that could \\"heal\\" and \\"reinvigorate\\" cells in the human body and remove poisonous substances. As a result, radium gained popularity as a \\"health trend\\" in the 1920s and radium salts were added to food, drinks, clothing, toys, and even toothpaste.Harvie, David I. The Radium Century. Endeavor 1999 Vol. 23, Issue 3: 100-105 Furthermore, many respectable journals and newspapers in the early 1900s published statements claiming that radium posed no health hazard. The main problem with the explosion of interest in radium was the lack of radium on earth itself. In 1913, it was reported that the Radium Institute had four grams of radium total, which at the time was more than half the world supply. Numerous countries and institutions across the world set out to extract as much radium as possible, a time-consuming and expensive task. It was reported in Science magazine in 1919 that the United States had produced approximately 55 grams of radium since 1913, which was also more than half the radium produced in the world at the time.Voil, Charles H. Radium Production. Science 17 March 1919 Vol. 49, No 1262: 227-228 A principal source for radium is pitchblende, which holds a total of 257 mg of radium per ton of U3O8. With so little product recovered from such a large amount of material, it was difficult to extract a large quantity of radium. This was the reason radium bromide became one of the most expensive materials on earth. In 1921, it was stated in Time magazine that one ton of radium cost 17,000,000,000 Euros, whereas one ton of gold cost 208,000 Euros and one ton of diamond cost 400,000,000 Euros. Radium bromide was also found to induce phosphorescence at normal temperatures.100 and 50 years ago. Nature 24 July 2003 Vol. 424, Issue 6927: 381 This led to the US army manufacturing and supplying luminous watches and gun sights to soldiers. It also allowed for the invention of the spinthariscope, which soon became a popular household item.Schwarcz, Joe. A Dazzling display in a little jar. The Gazette: Saturday Extra; The Right Chemistry pg B5 Properties Radium bromide is a luminous salt that causes the air surrounding it, even when encased in a tube, to glow a brilliant green and demonstrate all bands of the nitrogen spectrum. It is possible that the effect of the alpha radiation on the nitrogen in the air causes this luminescence. Radium bromide is highly reactive and crystals can sometimes explode, especially if heated. Helium gas evolved from alpha particles can accumulate within the crystals, which can cause them to weaken and rupture. Radium bromide will crystallize when separated from aqueous solution. It forms a dihydrate, very similar to barium bromide. Production Radium bromide is not found in nature; it is created. To extract radium from uranium or pitchblende ores, the most common practice is the \\"Curie method\\", which involves two major stages. The first stage is treating uranium ore with a chemical to concentrate the radium as a combination of radium and barium. This is done by treating the ore with a barium salt and sulfuric acid which make the uranium, iron, copper, and other components within the ore become water- soluble and are drained away. A residue containing gangue, barium, radium, and lead sulfates is left over. The mixture will then be treated with sodium chloride and sodium carbonate to remove the lead and convert radium and barium into carbonates that are insoluble in hydrochloric acid. The second step requires fractional crystallization to separate the barium from the radium. Because radium and barium have different miscibility in bromine or chlorine, those two chemicals are chosen for the fractional crystallization, and enables the two elements to be separated, leaving behind an aqueous solution of radium bromide or radium chloride. Once the radium is separated, the aqueous radium solution is dehydrated with a dry air stream at 200¬∞C, leaving behind crystals of radium bromide. Another method is to heat radium chloride and dehydrate it with a dry hydrogen bromide gas stream, but this method is considered more dangerous due to hydrogen bromide's toxicity and corrosive proterties. Hazards Radium bromide, like all radium compounds, is highly radioactive and very toxic. Due to its chemical similarity to calcium, radium tends to accumulate in the bones, where it irradiates the bone marrow and can cause anemia, leukemia, sarcoma, bone cancer, genetic defects, infertility, ulcers, and necrosis. Symptoms of poisoning can take years to develop, by which time it is usually too late for any effective medical treatment. Radium bromide also poses a severe environmental hazard, amplified due to its high solubility in water, and it can bioaccumulate and cause long-lasting damage to organisms. Radium bromide is highly reactive, and crystals can explode if violently shocked or heated. This is, in part, due to self-damage of the crystals by alpha radiation, which weakens the lattice structure. Uses Radium and radium salts were commonly used for treating cancer; however, these treatments have been mostly phased out in favor of less toxic chemicals such as technetium or strontium-89. Radium bromide was also used in luminous paint on watches, but its use was ultimately phased out in the 1960-1970s in favor of less dangerous chemicals like promethium and tritium.

The character was born during the March 5, 1992, episode as the daughter of Brad Carlton (Don Diamont) and Traci Abbott (Beth Maitland). After leaving the soap opera three years later, the character returned as a teenager in 2001, portrayed by Lyndsy Fonseca, who remained in the role until 2005. The following year, the role was recast with Adrianne Le√≥n, who portrayed the character for a year until Sursok took over. Sursok exited the role in 2009, following the death of the character. In 2010, an uncredited actress reprised the role in a dream. The character was portrayed as a \\"sweet Daddy's girl\\" who rebelled during her teen years. She was also notorious for her romance with J.T. Hellstrom, a relationship considered a soap opera supercouple. Viewers voted them onto top couple lists multiple times. The character's onscreen death in 2009 met with both positive and negative reviews from critics. Casting Colleen was born onscreen in 1992 and, after being portrayed by a string of child actors between then and 1995, the character left Genoa City for New York City with her mother, Traci. Colleen was rapidly aged to fifteen in 2001 when Lyndsy Fonseca assumed the role. In 2004, Fonseca was let go, as Colleen returned to New York to live with her mother. The Young and the Restless executive producer and head writer Jack Smith left the door open for Fonseca to return. \\"That means a lot to me,\\" Fonseca said. \\"He's been really cool about that.\\" Fonseca briefly reprised the role from December 2004 to February 2005. in 2005, Melissa Claire Egan screen tested for the role, and in January 2006, the role was recast with Adrianne Le√≥n. Previously, Leon was recognized for her role as Brook Lynn Ashton on ABC's General Hospital. As her storyline on General Hospital diminished, executive producer Jill Farren Phelps told Leon to commence auditioning for other projects including other soap operas, and was soon cast as Colleen. Fan response to this news was negative, as viewers felt Leon would not fit in the role. Leon wanted to help the viewers with the transition. \\"Since I was leaving GH one day and airing the next as Colleen, it was a decision on my part to blend in her look with Brook's,\\" she said. General Hospital also planned to write Brook out by scripting her new destination as the Carlton Music Academy in Genoa City. That plan was not followed through. Leon was released from her contract in June 2007 and the role was recast with Australian actress and musician Tammin Sursok. In an interview with Soap Opera Weekly, Leon said her firing shocked her. \\"When I got the call, I asked when my last day was, and it had already passed,\\" she said. \\"There was already a replacement. The whole thing was done and sealed.\\" When she published the news on her Myspace page, she received a \\"flood of fan support.\\" Rumors went around that Leon was fired because of her fluctuating weight. Leon said the extra weight she gained was a result of medication and a storyline that was never explored. She first gained weight from the steroids she was taking for an allergic reaction to the wool she had to wear as part of Colleen's winter wardrobe. She was later asked to keep the weight on by Lynn Marie Latham, the Young and the Restless head writer. \\"Lynn contacted me about doing a weight storyline with Colleen,\\" Leon said. \\"She wanted to put out the message that people come in all sizes- she wanted to put some balance out there. I agreed that was the right message and I loved that she asked me.\\" So she kept the added weight on for authenticity. Whether her firing had to do with the weight gain, Leon said she did not know. Sursok, who gained a following portraying Dani Sutherland on the Australian soap opera Home and Away in the early 2000s, met rejection from a number of The Young and the Restless viewers. Despite negativity she also received positive viewer feedback. \\"The fans have been really great,\\" she said. In preparation for the role, Sursok tried to catch up on Colleen's history. \\"I watched the last six months of episodes,\\" she said. After two years in the role, the actress departed and the writers killed off Colleen. In an interview with Soap Opera Digest in October 2009, Sursok said it was difficult to pursue outside projects and appear on The Young and the Restless as well. Her departure was a mutual decision by her and the show. \\"I was satisfied with the way that my character was written out,\\" she said. \\"I think a little bit of drama is always fun, and I had a memorable ending that created some good storyline for so many other people. I'm glad I got to be a part of that.\\" Development =Characterization= Colleen was characterized as a \\"sweet Daddy's girl.\\" Leon wanted to make the character more grown up. \\"She's still the same person, but she's 20 now and she's had a year of college,\\" she said. \\"She's been in New York for a year, and New York itself can change a person. I wanted to bring that fresh element to that character.\\" Leon said Colleen fans came over to her message board after she got the role and tried to fill her in on the details of the part so she would not \\"screw things up.\\" Though she looked over the information, Leon said, \\"I didn't want to go into detail, because I did want to come in and have a fresh start with the character. Coming in as a recast was stressful already, so trying to mimic what she did‚Ä¶. I got this [role] for a reason ‚Äî something I did ‚Äî so I didn't want to lose that element. Plus, the character's grown up.\\" Sursok hoped to bring something new to the role while keeping with the familiar. \\"It's very hard to come in and have a background already in place for a character,\\" she said. \\"You want to remember who the character was from the beginning, but I'd like to change it up a bit. People evolve; characters evolve. I think Colleen is torn between two worlds right now. Her father treats her like a child, but she's trying to grow up.\\" An element Sursok wanted to add to the character was drama. \\"Everyone wants to play what they don't have and my life's very settled at the moment,\\" she said. \\"It would be nice to spice things up, maybe have an affair with someone.\\" =Relationship with J.T. Hellstrom= The original storyline designed for J.T. and Colleen centered around an unrequited crush she feels for him. Luckinbill and Fonseca, the first actress to portray Colleen, thought their character's relationship would progress no further than friendship. Fonseca said that if they became a couple, the fun brought on by the \\"tug-and-pull\\" element between them could disappear. Luckinbill considered the age difference too great an obstacle to overcome, as at the time, J.T. was 18 years old and Colleen was 15. Smith later pushed for the plot to be taken further and the characters were paired romantically. Both soap opera critics and members of the show's cast and crew considered this a controversial and surprising move. Fonseca stated she \\"wasn't expecting it at all\\", and admitted that even former executive producer David Shaughnessy found the pairing \\"shocking\\". The writers used J.T.'s relationship with Colleen to bring out a more sympathetic side to him that the audience up to that point never witnessed before. Smith characterized their storyline as \\"taking this guy on the journey from wild college kid to being in love with this little high school sophomore\\". They also positioned Colleen as the aggressor in the relationship by scripting her as pursuing J.T., while he, in an uncharacteristic move, held off because of the difference in their ages. The writers \\"carefully navigated the development of this relationship, emphasizing its tender, supportive aspects.\\" They scripted them as \\"ferociously protective\\" of each other. =Death= For the scenes leading up to Colleen's death, The Young and the Restless went on location to Franklin Canyon, California. The inside of the lake that Colleen drowns in was recreated in the CBS Studios. The Bold and the Beautiful's head writer and executive producer Bradley Bell allowed Don Diamont to return to The Young and the Restless as Colleen's deceased father, Brad, as one of the visions Colleen has while unconscious. Diamont currently portrays The Bold and the Beautiful's Bill Spencer, Jr. \\"In order to accommodate contract constraints and actors' availability, we were writing scenes that were shot the following week, which is very unusual,\\" said The Young and the Restless's co-headwriter Scott Hamner. \\"The appearance of Don gave a depth of feeling to the show that would not have been possible without him.\\" During the taping of Colleen's final scenes, Sursok was not there. \\"They had to use insert shots of me [which were filmed beforehand] for when she was shown in bed at the hospital,\\" she said. Storylines =2001‚Äì07= After returning to town with her mother, Colleen became friends with local girls Lily Winters and Sierra Hoffman, and begins a romance with J.T. Hellstrom. At first, Colleen's family was wary of J.T. as he had a bad track record with women, but they eventually accepted the relationship. Sex became a stumbling block for the couple. Colleen made sexual overtures to J.T. and he turned her down because of their age difference. Not long afterward, he gave in to the advances of an older woman, Anita Hodges. When Colleen found out, she was devastated and the two broke up, though however they reconciled soon after. When Lily began dating Kevin Fisher, Colleen told Lily's parents Drucilla and Neil Winters after the relationship turned sexual. In retaliation, Kevin trapped Colleen in Gina Roma's restaurant and started a fire. Colleen survived after J.T. went into the building and carried her out. She remained distrustful of Kevin, who covered up his crimes. Colleen left Genoa City for New York because she felt she was getting in the way of J.T.'s music career. She later returned expecting to reunite with him, but he had moved on with Mackenzie Browning. She was also shocked to learn that Kevin had been accepted by most of the community, Lily included. After Mac left town, Colleen and J.T. reconciled. She was rocked by the revelation that her father had assumed the name of Brad Carlton, and was in fact the son of Holocaust survivor and art historian Rebecca Kaplan. The majority of the Kaplan family had been killed because Rebecca had made it her life's work to return artwork stolen by the Nazis. Following her grandmother's lead, Colleen began to study art history in college under a professor named Adrian Korbel, and it became apparent to both that they had more than a student/teacher relationship, much to the chagrin of the Kaplans, who were still in hiding, and her boyfriend J.T. Colleen used Professor Korbel's knowledge to help solve the mystery of the Grudgeon Reliquary, the artifact that lead to the Kaplan family's murder. Despite her family's objections and a growing possibility that Korbel is involved in the murder of Newman Enterprises executive Carmen Mesta, Colleen cheated on J.T. with Adrian on Valentine's Day. Colleen and Kevin were then kidnapped by Jana Hawkes as part of her scheme involving the reliquary mystery. She attempted to kill them both and frame Kevin for the crimes she committed by setting the building on fire. As both Colleen and Kevin were succumbing to the smoke, J.T. and Korbel managed to save them. After Colleen recovered, she cleared Kevin's name, and afterward the two forgave each other and became friends. After breaking up with J.T., Colleen tried to start a relationship with Korbel, but her family and J.T. threw up roadblocks. After Adrian nearly lost his job, they attempted to feign a break-up and continued to see each other, but Sharon Newman discovers them and told Brad. As a result, Brad cut his daughter off financially, though Colleen soon overcame this obstacle with a loan from her uncle Jack Abbott. =2007‚Äì09= Colleen, furious with Brad, gave Korbel permission to use her family's story in his new book, Saved From the Ashes. They broke up after she changed her mind about the book and Brad stopped the publication. Korbel moved on with Amber Moore while Colleen began a relationship with Daniel Romalotti. Their relationship ended soon after when Daniel reunited with Amber. After Brad died saving Sharon's son Noah Newman from drowning in a frozen pond, Colleen resolved to honor her father's memory by stepping into his seat on the Newman Enterprises board of directors. She angrily lashed out at the company's founder and CEO, Victor Newman, Brad's long-time rival, as she believed he is partly to blame for her father's death. Victor paid Jeffrey and Gloria Bardwell to catch Colleen in a compromising situation so she could be kicked off the board. They succeeded by paying a bartender to get her drunk and tape her flashing her breasts in public. Victor's vendetta against Colleen brought her closer to J.T., who at the time was married to Victoria Newman. They kissed before she is kidnapped and held hostage by Jack's mentally unstable ex-wife, Patty Williams. She later escaped by canoe on the nearby lake, but fell in and nearly drowned. Jack took her to the hospital, and she was declared brain dead. Traci made the decision to remove her daughter from life support and donated Colleen's heart to Victor. At Colleen's memorial service, her family gathered to remember the good times and say their goodbyes to her. They let red balloons float away in the air to as a way of saying goodbye to Colleen. One year later, Colleen made an appearance in a dream had by Victor. He realized it was she at the end when he knew he was doing wrong by her. Reception Colleen became popular when paired with J.T. The couple was listed as the fourth most romantic couple of 2003 in Soap Opera Update: The Year in Soaps. After Fonseca was let go from the role, she was voted fourth \\"most missed actor\\" of 2004 in that year's issue of Soap Opera Update The Year in Soaps. When the role was recast with Leon, the couple was listed as the favorite The Young and the Restless couple in Soap Opera Digest and the couple's portrayers, Leon and Thad Luckinbill, were listed as the series' favorite actress and actor. When Colleen was killed off in 2009, the storyline received both positive and negative feedback from critics. Soaps In Depth referred to the scenes while Colleen sank under the water, while her family worried about her whereabouts an \\"instant classic.\\" Soap Opera Weekly's Mala Bhattacharjee said the dream sequences that Colleen had while drowning were ludicrous. Janet Di Lauro, from Soap Opera Weekly, criticized the plot twist and said the \\"mere thought of the Abbott family donating Colleen's heart to Victor is enough to melt the brain of even the most casual fan.\\" Di Lauro considered the performances of Christel Khalil (Lily), Peter Bergman (Jack) and Beth Maitland (Traci) as the only positive element of the story. She said the scenes where Lily said goodbye to Colleen \\"was one of the most touching scenes to air during Colleen's last days. It was uplifting to see the ailing Lily keep her composure and promise Colleen she would live her life for the both of them.\\" Soap Opera Digest named the story Editors' Choice for the week, praising it as a \\"chilling, rich and game- changing coda to this wrenching family tragedy\\" and a \\"fitting tribute to the lost Colleen.\\" See also *J.T. and Colleen *Colleen Carlton @ soapcentral.com References The Young and the Restless characters Fictional business executives Fictional models Female characters in television Fictional waiting staff Fictional female businesspeople Television characters introduced in 1992 ","title":"Colleen Carlton"},{"id":"5752945","text":"The Islamic prophet Muhammad came to Medina following the migration of his followers in what is known as the Hijra (migration to Medina) in 622. He had been invited to Medina by city leaders to adjudicate disputes between clans from which the city suffered. He left Medina to return to and conquer Mecca in December 629. Background A delegation from Medina, consisting of the representatives of the twelve important clans of Medina, invited Muhammad as a neutral outsider to serve as the chief arbitrator for the entire community.Esposito (1998), p. 17. There was fighting in Yathrib (Medina) mainly involving its Arab and Jewish inhabitants for around a hundred years before 620. The recurring slaughters and disagreements over the resulting claims, especially after the battle of Bu'ath in which all the clans were involved, made it obvious to them that the tribal conceptions of blood-feud and an eye for an eye were no longer workable unless there was one man with authority to adjudicate in disputed cases.The Cambridge History of Islam (1977), p. 39 The delegation from Medina pledged themselves and their fellow- citizens to accept Muhammad into their community and physically protect him as one of themselves.Alford Welch, Muhammad, Encyclopedia of Islam Muhammad instructed his followers to emigrate to Medina until virtually all of his followers had left Mecca. Being alarmed at the departure of Muslims, according to the tradition, the Meccans plotted to assassinate him. He instructed his cousin and future son-in-law Ali to sleep in his bed to trick the assassins that he had stayed (and to fight them off in his stead) and secretly slipped away from the town.Moojan Momen, An Introduction to Shi'i Islam: The History and Doctrines of Twelver Shi ªism, Yale University Press, p. 5 By 622, Muhammad had emigrated to Medina, then known as Yathrib, a large agricultural oasis. Following the emigration, the Meccans seized the properties of the Muslim emigrants in Mecca.Fazlur Rahman (1979), p. 21 Among the things Muhammad did in order to settle the longstanding grievances among the tribes of Medina was drafting a document known as the Constitution of Medina (date debated), establishing a kind of brotherhood among the eight Medinan tribes and Muslim emigrants from Mecca, which specified the rights and duties of all citizens and the relationship of the different communities in Medina (including that of the Muslim community to other communities specifically the Jews and other \\"Peoples of the Book\\"). The community defined in the Constitution of Medina, umma, had a religious outlook but was also shaped by the practical considerations and substantially preserved the legal forms of the old Arab tribes. Muhammad's adoption of facing north towards Jerusalem when performing the daily prayers (qibla) however need not to necessarily be a borrowing from the Jews as the reports about the direction of prayer before migration to Medina are contradictory and further this direction of prayer was also practiced among other groups in Arabia. The first group of pagan converts to Islam in Medina were the clans who had not produced great leaders for themselves but had suffered from warlike leaders from other clans. This was followed by the general acceptance of Islam by the pagan population of Medina, apart from some exceptions. This was, according to Ibn Ishaq, influenced by the conversion to Islam of Sa'd ibn Mua'dh, one of the prominent leaders in Medina. =Relationship with followers of Abrahamic religions= In the course of Muhammad proselytizing in Mecca, he viewed Christians and Jews (both of whom he referred to as \\"People of the Book\\") as natural allies, part of the Abrahamic religions, sharing the core principles of his teachings, and anticipated their acceptance and support. Muslims, like Jews, were at that time praying towards Jerusalem. In the Constitution of Medina, Muhammad demanded the Jews' political loyalty in return for religious and cultural autonomy in many treaties.See: * Esposito (1998), p.17 * Neusner (2003), p.153 The Jewish clans however did not obey these treaties because of a feud with the Muslims though in the course of time there were a few converts from them.Watt (1956), p. 175, p. 177. After his migration to Medina, Muhammad's attitude towards Christians and Jews changed \\"because of experience of treachery\\". Norman Stillman states:Norman Stillman, Yahud, Encyclopedia of Islam Internal disputes A map of the Badr campaign. Economically uprooted by their Meccan persecutors, the Muslim migrants turned to raiding Meccan caravans to respond to their persecution and to provide sustenance for their Muslim families, thus initiating armed conflict between the Muslims and the pagan Quraysh of Mecca.Lewis, \\"The Arabs in History,\\" 2003, p. 44.Montgomery Watt, Muhammad, Prophet and Statesman, Oxford University Press, 1961, p. 105. Muhammad delivered Qur'anic verses permitting the Muslims, \\"those who have been expelled from their homes\\", to fight the Meccans in opposition to persecution (see Qur'an Sura 22 (Al-Hajj) Ayat 39-40).John Kelsay, Islam and War: A Study in Comparative Ethics, p. 21 These attacks provoked and pressured Mecca by interfering with trade, and allowed the Muslims to acquire wealth, power and prestige while working toward their ultimate goal of inducing Mecca's submission to the new faith.Watt, Muhammad, Prophet and Statesman, Oxford University Press, 1961, p. 105, 107Bernard Lewis (1993), p. 41. In March 624, Muhammad led some three hundred warriors in a raid on a Meccan merchant caravan. The Muslims set an ambush for the Meccans at Badr.Rodinson (2002), p. 164. Aware of the plan, the Meccan caravan eluded the Muslims. Meanwhile, a force from Mecca was sent to protect the caravan. The force did not return home upon hearing that the caravan was safe. The battle of Badr began in March 624.The Cambridge History of Islam, p. 45 Though outnumbered more than three to one, the Muslims won the battle, killing at least forty- five Meccans and taking seventy prisoners for ransom; only fourteen Muslims died. They had also succeeded in killing many of the Meccan leaders, including Abu Jahl.Glubb (2002), pp. 179‚Äì186. Muhammad himself did not fight, directing the battle from a nearby hut alongside Abu Bakr.Watt (1961), pp. 122‚Äì3. In the weeks following the battle, Meccans visited Medina in order to ransom captives from Badr. Many of these had belonged to wealthy families, and were likely ransomed for a considerable sum. Those captives who were not sufficiently influential or wealthy were usually freed without ransom. Muhammad's decision was that those prisoners who refused to end their persecution of Muslims and were wealthy but did not ransom themselves should be killed.Watt (1961), p. 123.Rodinson(2002), pp. 168‚Äì9. Muhammad ordered the immediate execution of two Quraysh men without entertaining offers for their release. Both men, which included Uqba ibn Abu Mu'ayt, had personally attempted to kill Muhammad in Mecca. The raiders had won a lot of treasure, and the battle helped to stabilize the Medinan community.Lewis, \\"The Arabs in History,\\" p. 44. Muhammad and his followers saw in the victory a confirmation of their faith and a prime importance in the affairs of Medina. Those remaining pagans in Medina were very bitter about the advance of Islam. In particular Asma bint Marwan and Abu 'Afak had composed verses insulting some of the Muslims and thereby violated the Constitution of Medina to which they belonged. These two were assassinated and Muhammad did not disapprove of it. No one dared to take vengeance on them, and some of the members of the clan of Asma bint Marwan who had previously converted to Islam in secret, now professed openly. This marked an end to the overt opposition to Muhammad among the pagans in Medina.Watt (1956), p. 179. Muhammad expelled from Medina the Banu Qaynuqa, one of the three main Jewish tribes. Jewish opposition \\"may well have been for political as well as religious reasons\\".Endress (2003), p. 29 On religious grounds, the Jews were skeptical of the possibility of a non-Jewish prophet,The Cambridge History of Islam (1977), pp. 43‚Äì44 and also had concerns about possible incompatibilities between the Qur'an and their own scriptures.Cohen (1995), p. 23 The Qur'an's response regarding the possibility of a non-Jew being a prophet was that Abraham was not a Jew. The Qur'an also stated that it was \\"restoring the pure monotheism of Abraham which had been corrupted in various, clearly specified, ways by Jews and Christians\\". According to Francis Edward Peters, \\"The Jews also began secretly to connive with Muhammad's enemies in Mecca to overthrow him.\\"Francis Edward Peters (2003), p. 194. Following the battle of Badr, Muhammad also made mutual-aid alliances with a number of Bedouin tribes to protect his community from attacks from the northern part of Hejaz. =Conflicts with the Quraish= The attack at Badr committed Muhammad to total war with Meccans, who were now eager to avenge their defeat. To maintain their economic prosperity, the Meccans needed to restore their prestige, which had been lost at Badr.Watt (1961), p. 132. The Meccans sent out a small party for a raid on Medina to restore confidence and reconnoitre. The party retreated immediately after a surprise and speedy attack but with minor damages; there was no combat.Watt (1964), pp. 124‚Äì125 In the ensuing months, Muhammad led expeditions on tribes allied with Mecca and sent out a raid on a Meccan caravan.Watt (1961), p. 134 Abu Sufyan ibn Harb subsequently gathered an army of three thousand men and set out for an attack on Medina.Lewis (1960), p. 45. They were accompanied by some prominent women of Mecca, such as Hind bint Utbah, Abu Sufyan's wife, who had lost family members at Badr. These women provided encouragement in keeping with Bedouin custom, calling out the names of the dead at Badr.Rodinson (2002), pp. 177, 180. A scout alerted Muhammad of the Meccan army's presence and numbers a day later. The next morning, at the Muslim conference of war, there was dispute over how best to repel the Meccans. Muhammad and many of the senior figures suggested that it would be safer to fight within Medina and take advantage of its heavily fortified strongholds. Younger Muslims argued that the Meccans were destroying their crops, and that huddling in the strongholds would destroy Muslim prestige. Muhammad eventually conceded to the wishes of the latter, and readied the Muslim force for battle. Thus, Muhammad led his force outside to the mountain of Uhud (where the Meccans had camped) and fought the Battle of Uhud on March 23.\\"Uhud\\", Encyclopedia of Islam.Watt (1964) p. 137 Although the Muslim army had the best of the early encounters, indiscipline on the part of tactically placed archers led to a tactical defeat for the Muslim army, with 75 Muslims killed. However, the Meccans failed to achieve their goal of destroying the Muslims completely.Watt (1974) p. 137 The Meccans did not occupy the town and withdrew to Mecca, since they were unable to attack Muhammad's position again, owing to military losses, low morale and the possibility of Muslim resistance in the town. There was also hope that Abd- Allah ibn Ubayy leading a group of Muslims in Medina could be won over by diplomacy.Watt (1974) p. 141 Following the defeat, Muhammad's detractors in Medina said that if the victory at Badr was proof of the genuineness of his mission, then the defeat at Uhud was proof that his mission was not genuine.Rodinson (2002), p. 183. Muhammad subsequently delivered Qur'anic verses 133-135 and 160-162 from the Al-i-Imran sura, indicating that the loss, however, was partly a punishment for disobedience and partly a test for steadfastness.Watt (1964) p. 144. The rousing of the nomads  In the battle of Uhud, the Meccans had collected all the available men from the Quraysh and the neighboring tribes friendly to them but had not succeeded in destroying the Muslim community. In order to raise a more powerful army, Abu Sufyan attracted the support of the great nomadic tribes to the north and east of Medina, using propaganda about Muhammad's weakness, promises of treasure, memories of the prestige of Quraysh and straight bribes.Watt (1956), p. 30. Muhammad's policy in the next two years after the battle of Uhud was to prevent as best he could the formation of alliances against him. Whenever alliances of tribesmen against Medina were formed, he sent out an expedition to break it up. When Muhammad heard of men massing with hostile intentions against Medina, he reacted with severity.Watt (1956), p. 34 One example is the assassination of Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf, a member of the Jewish tribe of Banu Nadir who had gone to Mecca and written poems that had helped rouse the Meccans' grief, anger and desire for revenge after the battle of Badr (see the main article for other reasons for killing of Ka'b given in the historiographical sources).Watt (1956), p. 18 Around a year later, Muhammad expelled the Jewish Banu Nadir from Medina.Watt (1956), pp. 220‚Äì221 Muhammad's attempts to prevent formation of confederation against him were not successful, although he was able to augment his own forces and keep many tribes from joining the confederation.Watt (1956), p. 35  Siege of Medina  Abu Sufyan, the military leader of the Quraysh, with the help of Banu Nadir, the exiled Jewish tribe from Medina, had mustered a force of numbering 10,000 men. Muhammad was able to prepare a force of about 3,000 men. He had however adopted a new form of defense, unknown in Arabia at that time: Muslims had dug trenches wherever Medina lay open to cavalry attack. The idea is credited to a Persian convert to Islam, Salman. The siege of Medina began on 31 March 627 and lasted for two weeks.Watt (1956), p. 36, 37 Abu Sufyan's troops were unprepared for the fortifications they were confronted with, and after an ineffectual siege, the coalition decided to go home.Rodinson (2002), pp. 209‚Äì211. The Qur'an discusses this battle in verses 9-27 of sura 33, Al- Ahzab.Uri Rubin, Quraysh, Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an Battle of Khandaq (Battle of the Trench) During the Battle of the Trench, the Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayza who were located at the south of Medina were charged with treachery. After the retreat of the coalition, Muslims besieged Banu Qurayza, the remaining major Jewish tribe in Medina. The Banu Qurayza surrendered and all the men, apart from a few who converted to Islam, were beheaded, while all the women and children were enslaved.Peterson, Muhammad: the prophet of God, p. 126Tariq Ramadan, In the Footsteps of the Prophet, Oxford University Press, p. 141 In dealing with Muhammad's treatment of the Jews of Medina, aside from political explanations, Arab historians and biographers have explained it as \\"the punishment of the Medina Jews, who were invited to convert and refused, perfectly exemplify the Quran's tales of what happened to those who rejected the prophets of old.\\"Francis Edward Peters (2003), p. 77 F.E. Peters, a western scholar of Islam, states that Muhammad's treatment of Jews of Medina was essentially political being prompted by what Muhammad read as treasonous and not some transgression of the law of God. Peters adds that Muhammad was possibly emboldened by his military successes and also wanted to push his advantage. Economical motivations according to Peters also existed since the poorness of the Meccan migrants was a source of concern for Muhammad.F.E.Peters (2003), pp. 76‚Äì8. Peters argues that Muhammad's treatment of the Jews of Medina was \\"quite extraordinary\\", \\"matched by nothing in the Qur'an\\", and is \\"quite at odds with Muhammad's treatment of the Jews he encountered outside Medina.\\" According to Welch, Muhammad's treatment of the three major Jewish tribes brought Muhammad closer to his goal of organizing a community strictly on a religious basis. He adds that some Jews from other families were, however, allowed to remain in Medina. In the siege of Medina, the Meccans had exerted their utmost strength towards the destruction of the Muslim community. Their failure resulted in a significant loss of prestige; their trade with Syria was gone.Watt (1956), p. 39 Following the battle of trench, Muhammad made two expeditions to the north which ended without any fighting. While returning from one of these two expeditions (or some years earlier according to other early accounts), an accusation of adultery was made against Aisha, Muhammad's wife. Aisha was exonerated from the accusations when Muhammad announced that he had received a revelation, verse4 in the An-Nur sura, confirming Aisha's innocence and directing that charges of adultery be supported by four eyewitnesses. Truce of Hudaybiyya Although Qur'anic verses had been received from God commanding the Hajj, the Muslims had not performed it due to the enmity of the Quraysh. In the month of Shawwal 628, Muhammad ordered his followers to obtain sacrificial animals and to make preparations for a pilgrimage (umrah) to Mecca, saying that God had promised him the fulfillment of this goal in a vision where he was shaving his head after the completion of the Hajj.Lings (1987), p. 249 According to Lewis, Muhammad felt strong enough to attempt an attack on Mecca, but on the way it became clear that the attempt was premature and the expedition was converted into a peaceful pilgrimage.Lewis (2002), p. 42. Andrae disagrees, writing that the Muslim state of ihram (which restricted their freedom of action) and the paucity of arms carried indicated that the pilgrimage was always intended to be pacific. Most Islamic scholars agree to Andrae's view.Andrae; Menzel (1960) p. 156; See also: Watt (1964) p. 183 Upon hearing of the approaching 1,400 Muslims, the Quraysh sent out a force of 200 cavalry to halt them. Muhammad evaded them by taking a more difficult route, thereby reaching al-Hudaybiyya, just outside Mecca.\\"al-Hudaybiya\\", Encyclopedia of Islam According to Watt, although Muhammad's decision to make the pilgrimage was based on his dream, he was at the same time demonstrating to the pagan Meccans that Islam does not threaten the prestige of their sanctuary, and that Islam was an Arabian religion.Watt, W. Montgomery. \\"al- Hudaybiya or al-Hudaybiyya.\\" Encyclopaedia of Islam. Negotiations commenced with emissaries going to and from Mecca. While these continued, rumors spread that one of the Muslim negotiators, Uthman ibn Affan, had been killed by the Quraysh. Muhammad responded by calling upon the pilgrims to make a pledge not to flee (or to stick with Muhammad, whatever decision he made) if the situation descended into war with Mecca. This pledge became known as the \\"Pledge of Good Pleasure\\" (, ) or the \\"Pledge of the Tree.\\" News of Uthman's safety, however, allowed for negotiations to continue, and the treaty of Hudaybiyyah, scheduled to last ten years was eventually signed between the Muslims and the Quraysh. The main points of treaty were the following: # The two parties and their allies should desist from hostilities against each other.Lings (1987), p. 253 # Muhammad, should not perform Hajj this year but in the next year, Mecca will be evacuated for three days for Muslims to perform Hajj.Watt, al- ·∏§udaybiya or al-Hudaybiyya, Encyclopaedia of Islam # Muhammad should send back any Meccan who had gone to Medina without the permission of his or her protector (according to William Montgomery Watt, this presumably refers to minors or women). # It was allowed for both Muhammad and the Quraysh to enter into alliance with others. Many Muslims were not satisfied with the terms of the treaty. However, the Qur'anic sura Al-Fath (The Victory) assured the Muslims that the expedition from which they were now returning must be considered a victorious one.Lings (1987), p. 255 It was only later that Muhammad's followers would realise the benefit behind this treaty. These benefits, according to Welch, included the inducing of the Meccans to recognise Muhammad as an equal; a cessation of military activity posing well for the future; and gaining the admiration of Meccans who were impressed by the incorporation of the pilgrimage rituals. After signing the truce, Muhammad made an expedition against the Jewish oasis of Khaybar. The explanation given by western scholars of Islam for this attack ranges from the presence of the Banu Nadir in Khaybar, who were inciting hostilities along with neighboring Arab tribes against Muhammad, to deflecting from what appeared to some Muslims as the inconclusive result of the truce of Hudaybiyya, increasing Muhammad's prestige among his followers and capturing booty.Veccia Vaglieri, L. \\"Khaybar\\", Encyclopaedia of Islam According to Muslim tradition, Muhammad also sent letters to many rulers of the world, asking them to convert to Islam (the exact date are given variously in the sources).Lings (1987), p. 260Khan (1998), pp. 250‚Äì251 Hence he sent messengers (with letters) to Heraclius of the Byzantine Empire (the eastern Roman Empire), Khosrau of Persia, the chief of Yemen and to some others. Most critical scholars doubt this tradition, however.Gabriel Said Reynolds, The Emergence of Islam (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2012), p. 49. In the years following the truce of Hudaybiyya, Muhammad sent his forces against the Arabs of Mu'tah on Byzantine soil in Transjordania since according to the tradition, they had murdered Muhammad's envoy.\\" Muslims scored victory in this battle.F. Buhl, Muta, Encyclopedia of Islam Conquest of Mecca and subsequent military expeditions Muhammad and the sahaba advancing on Mecca. The angels Gabriel, Michael, Israfil and Azrael, are also in the painting. In Ramadan 8 AH (around October 629), Muhammad left for Mecca with approximately 10,000 of his sahaba aiming to capture the city from the Quraysh following a violation of the terms of the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah by the Banu Bakr, who were allies of the Quraysh, after they attacked the Ban≈´ Khuza Ωah, allies of the Muslims. The Treaty had called for a 10-year truce and ceasefire between the Muslims, the Quraysh and their respective allies. Muhammad arrived at Mecca a week from his departure, dividing the army into four regiments, each entering Mecca from one point of entry. The conquest was largely bloodless and the Quraysh eventually surrendered without putting up a fight.Khan (1998), pp. 274‚Äì5.Watt (1956), p. 66. Following the Conquest of Mecca, Muhammad was informed of a military threat from the confederate tribes of Hawazin who were readying an army twice as strong as Muhammad and the sahaba. They were joined by the Thaqif inhabiting in the city of Ta‚Äôif who had adopted an anti-Meccan policy due to the decline of the prestige of Meccans. Both tribes were subsequently defeated in the Battle of Hunayn.Watt, Muhammad: Prophet and Statesman, Oxford University Press, p.207 Muhammad subsequently launched an expedition against the Byzantine Empire and their Ghassanid allies in the north in the Expedition of Tabuk. Although Muhammad did not make contact with hostile forces at Tabuk, he received the submission of some of the local chiefs of the region.M.A. al-Bakhit, Tabuk, Encyclopedia of Islam Following this expedition, the Banu Thaqif and other Bedouins submitted to Muhammad in order to be safe from attack and to benefit from the bounty of the wars. Following the Conquest of Mecca and these events, Muhammad would perform the Farewell Pilgrimage and return to Medina, where he would fall ill for several days with a headache and weakness. He died on Monday, June 8, 632, in the city, being buried where the home of his wife Aisha had been. It has since been modified several times and is now enclosed under the Green Dome within Al-Masjid al-Nabawi in Medina.

Pie is the now-obsolete original name for the magpie, a bird often connected with sorrow and misfortune. The crow is a scavenger, often thought of as feeding upon the bodies of men hanged or slain in battle, and thus associated with unhallowed and violent death. Synopsis A man encounters a woman in the woods and tries to seduce her, first offering her his love, then a ring and a velvet purse. In each case she repulses him, saying \\"the crow shall byte yow\\" (bite you). He rapes her. She requests first that he marry her, then that he give her \\"some of your good\\" (representing either a token of the lover's identity, or the \\"nurse's fee\\" for raising a bastard child), and finally that he tell her his name. In each case he refuses her, saying \\"For now the pye hathe peckyd yow\\" (clearly a sexual metaphor). Finally, she curses him, saying that she will not despair and will \\"recouer my harte agayne\\" (recover my heart again). The ballad contains a warning to young women to be suspicious, and avoid being raped. Motifs This ballad contrast with Child Ballad 5, Gil Brenton, where the woman is able to prove the identity of her child's father by the tokens he gave her.Francis James Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, v 1, p 64-5, Dover Publications, New York 1965 Analysis This ballad shows the thin line that existed in early Medieval society between seduction and rape; in either case the lady was held to be guilty of a misdeed, and her ability to prove the man's identity (and his acknowledgment of the event, even if he did not marry her) was as important from both a legal and moral standpoint as whether or not she gave consent. Inability to identify the man was generally held to be sufficient proof that the lady had been indiscriminately promiscuous, probably with her social inferiors. The request by the lady in Crow and Pie for some of her rapist's goods may seem mercenary by modern standards, but is quite understandable from a Medieval perspective. Money or a valuable token would indicate to the lady's parents (and her peers) that the man was not a serf, slave or beggar, and might serve as identification. In several other ballads a newly married woman avoids death at the hands of her husband, who has just discovered that she is with child, by producing a token left by her rapist; the token shows that the husband is the rapist, and he is therefore content. Finally, Crow and Pie is unusual in that the lady, although angry and ashamed, is not despondent or suicidal and appears ready to resume her normal life.

Early life Smith was born in Grand Junction, Colorado on November 19, 1909. At the age of ten, his mother died, and at age thirteen, his father died, leaving young Elmo an orphan. He was sent to live with his uncle on a ranch near Wilder, Idaho. He supported himself financially as he pursued an education at the College of Idaho in Caldwell. Smith received his B.A. in History in 1932, and moved to nearby Ontario, Oregon, just across the Snake River from Idaho. In Ontario, Smith began a long and successful career in the newspaper business. The year he arrived in town, Smith managed the Ontario Argus, and founded the Ontario Observer in 1936. As a newspaper owner and publisher, he began to gain stature in the community and entered politics. Voters in Ontario elected Smith mayor in 1940, and returned him to office for a second term in 1942. He resigned in 1943 in order to enlist in the U.S. Navy during the Second World War. Smith earned the rank of Lieutenant, serving in the Pacific Theater of Operations. He flew transport planes, and later commanded an air transport base in the South Pacific. He returned to civilian life at the war's 1945 conclusion. Upon returning to Ontario, its citizens returned Smith to the mayor's office. He continued to manage his newspaper holdings, purchasing the John Day Blue Mountain Eagle, and gaining an interest in The Madras Pioneer; while selling off his Ontario papers. In 1948, voters in Grant, Malheur, and Harney counties elected him to represent the region in the state senate. President of the Oregon State Senate State Senator Smith would stand up to the influential trucking and powerful lumber industry lobbies to gain passage of an increase in the state highway tax. His support for transportation projects gained him the chairmanship on the Senate Roads and Highways Committee in 1952, and was elected President of the Senate in 1955. Governorship The unexpected death of Governor Paul L. Patterson on January 31, 1956 elevated Senate President Elmo Smith to fill out the remainder of the first half of his term. Upon assuming office, Smith found himself running the state and a campaign for the 1956 gubernatorial election. His administration successfully raised spending on Public Education, formed a commission on aging, and joined a tri-state water-power consortium. He managed the state's finances in a fiscally conservative manner. Governor Smith also helped create the Water Resources Board, the agency that today manages and regulates Oregon's water resources. While winning the Republican nomination for governor, Smith was defeated in his attempt to win the governorship in his own right, to complete the last 2 years of Patterson's term. Robert D. Holmes, his Democratic challenger, managed to win a narrow victory in the 1956 gubernatorial race. Later life After leaving Salem, Smith concentrated on his newspaper empire, purchasing several weekly newspapers and the Albany Democrat-Herald, his largest acquisition. He ended up moving to Albany to better manage the Democrat-Herald. Smith returned to politics in a bid for the United States Senate seat opened by the death of Richard Neuberger in 1960. Smith lost this race to Maurine Neuberger, the Senator's widow. A run for National Chairman for the Republican Party failed in 1964. His last attempt at elected office, the chairmanship of the Oregon State Republican Party was successful. Death and legacy Smith died of cancer on July 15, 1968 in Albany, aged 58, and is buried in the Willamette Memorial Park Mausoleum.

Born Celia Elizabeth Prince, she began painting Australian wildflowers early in her artistic career. She first began painting Banksias after seeing a Banksia serrata near her home in Orbost, Victoria. Her first exhibition was at Leveson Gallery in Melbourne in 1965, and included three watercolours of Banksia species. Two years later she published Wildflowers of Victoria. In 1970, Rosser was appointed Science Faculty Artist at Monash University. She illustrated Peter Bridgewater's The Saltmarsh Plants of Southern Australia and The Mosses of Southern Australia by George Scott and Ilma Grace Stone. In 1974 she was appointed University Botanical Artist, and began the project of painting every Banksia species. The project took over 25 years to complete, and resulted in the publication of a three volume monograph entitled The Banksias, with accompanying text by Alex George. Publication of the final volume in 2000 represented the first time that such a large genus has been entirely painted. In 1997 she was awarded the Linnaean Society of London's Jill Smythies Award for botanical illustration, and in 1995 was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia. Monash University awarded her an honorary Master of Science degree in 1981, and an honorary PhD in 1999. Legacy In March 1978 a chance seeding of Banksia canei with deeply lobed leaves and a prostrate habit was registered as a cultivar by Alf Salkin under the names Banksia 'Celia Rosser' and Banksia canei 'Celia Rosser'. In 2001, Peter Olde and Neil Marriott published a description of a new Banksia species from the arid shrubland of Western Australia, naming it Banksia rosserae in Rosser's honour. Since 2002, the Friends of the Royal Botanic Gardens Melbourne have awarded the \\"Celia Rosser Medal for Botanical Art\\" to outstanding exhibitors at their \\"The Art of Botanical Illustration\\" exhibition.

Euouae ()Euouae in the Collins English Dictionary or Evovae is an abbreviation used in Latin psalters and other liturgical books to show the distribution of syllables in the differentia or variable melodic endings of the standard Psalm tones of Gregorian chant. It derives from the vowels in the words \\"saeculorum Amen\\" of the lesser doxology or Gloria Patri, which ends with the phrase In saecula saeculorum, Amen.

As a mnemonic coming from Latin, it is unclear that it should count as an English word; however, it is found in the unabridged Collins English Dictionary. Its all-vowel composition makes it an effective play for certain kinds of vowel-heavy Scrabble racks, and the plural form (‚Äúeuouaes‚Äù) means a bingo can be made in certain situations. A useful mnemonic for remembering the tricky spelling is by combining Euro (minus the ‚Äúr‚Äù) and UAE (as in United Arab Emirates). Both the singular and plural forms of the word are contained within the official Scrabble dictionary. A similar abbreviation, Aevia (or Aeuia), was used for Alleluia in medieval Office books. In Venetian and other Italian Office-Books of the 16th century, an equivalent abbreviation Hal'a, or Hal'ah, can be substituted for Aevia. References * Apel, Willi: Gregorian Chant.

According to the Portland Bureau of Planning, it \\"is one of the few remaining large urban industrial districts in the United States\\" and \\"one of the premier heavy industrial districts in the Pacific Northwest\\". It borders the neighborhoods of Linnton on the north, Forest Park on the west, the Northwest District on the south, and Cathedral Park (via the St. Johns Bridge), University Park, and Overlook across the Willamette River on the east. Burlington Northern Railroad Bridge 5.1 allows Amtrak and BNSF trains to cross the Willamette, connecting the neighborhood to North Portland and Washington state beyond. There are no schools or parks in Northwest Industrial, which has the smallest population of all 95 neighborhoods in Portland. Since 2001 almost all of the neighborhood has been designated the Guild's Lake Industrial Sanctuary, to preserve the land for long-term industrial use and to resist pressure for residential development.  History  The area was wetlands in the 19th century when Peter Guild, an early settler, received it as a donation land claim in 1848. In the 1880s the Northern Pacific Railroad built the Guild's Lake Rail Yard, and rail switching facilities have ever since played an integral role in the area's development (along with US Highway 30, which runs alongside the tracks here). The Lewis and Clark Exposition in 1905 took place on the shore of Guild's Lake and on a semi-artificial island in the middle of the lake. Water was constantly pumped from the Willamette River to keep it full. The lake was subsequently slowly converted to landfill, a process completed in the 1920s. During the Second World War a massive temporary housing complex provided residences and schools for shipyard workers and their families. It was removed soon after the war to make way for development of the area as an industrial and warehouse district. Interstate 505 was to have run through the neighborhood, connecting I-405 with US Route 30 (St. Helens Road). The freeway spur was canceled in 1979, but US Highway 30 makes use of some of the infrastructure that was built before cancellation.

It is one of two Spanish language regulators located in countries where the language does not have an official status nationwide, the other being the North American Academy of the Spanish Language in the United States. A founding member of the Asociaci√≥n de Academias de la Lengua Espa√±ola (ASALE), the Academy was formerly headquartered in the Casino Espa√±ol de Manila in Ermita, Manila before moving to its current headquarters in Makati. Background Countries with institutes that are members of the ASALE. The Philippine Academy of the Spanish Language was established in Manila on July 25, 1924. The eleventh Spanish language academy in the world to be founded, its establishment reflected the preeminent position of Spanish as a language in the Philippines at the time despite already-existing cultural influences coming from the United States. Despite the diminishing position of Spanish in the Philippines relative to English, the Academy continued to exist despite intermittent criticism. In 1986, Spanish poet D√°maso Alonso unsuccessfully called for its dissolution, citing Enrique Fern√°ndez Lumba, a member who had dismissed the organization as a \\"relic\\". In 2008, El Pa√≠s reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission revoked the Academy's corporate registration in 2003 due to its non-filing of annual returns. Despite this, the Academy nonetheless is recognized as possibly playing a key role again in revitalizing the Spanish language and promoting Spanish culture in the Philippines, a role that it also played in previous years. Dar√≠o Villanueva, director of the Real Academia Espa√±ola, visited the Philippine Academy of the Spanish Language in July 2017 as part of his official visit to the Philippines. During his visit, where he also presided over a meeting of the Academy's board of directors, he remarked that the Academy served as \\"the perennial lighthouse of the Spanish language\\" in the country. Status of Spanish in the Philippines Section 7, Article XIV of the present 1987 Philippine Constitution specifies Spanish (along with Arabic) as a language to \\"be promoted on a voluntary and optional basis\\". Spanish was the language of government, education and trade throughout the three centuries (333 years) of the Philippines being part of the Spanish Empire and continued to serve as a lingua franca until the first half of the 20th century. In December 2007, former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo signed a directive in Spain requiring the teaching and learning of the Spanish language in the Philippine school system starting in 2008. The Under-Secretary of the Department of Education, Vilma L. Labrador, circulated a Memorandum (17/XII/2007), on the \\"Restoration of the Spanish language in Philippine Education\\". In it, the Department mandates secondary schools to offer basic and advanced Spanish. Administration =Directors= The Philippine Academy of the Spanish Language is led by a Board of Directors (Junta Directiva), which includes a director, two honorary directors, a vice- director, a secretary, a treasurer, a coordinator and the organization's librarian. Since August 22, 2016, the Academy has been led by the Recollect priest Emmanuel Luis Romanillos. Romanillos, a historian who became an academic of the Academy in 2005 and who previously served as its coordinator prior to becoming director, is associate professor of Spanish, Italian and Latin at the University of the Philippines Diliman, where he has taught for 30 years. =Academics in order of seniority= Among the academics of the Philippine Academy, both former and current, are prominent political figures like former President Arroyo and former Foreign Affairs Secretary Alberto Romulo, religious figures such as Emeritus Archbishop of Ceb√∫ Cardinal Ricardo Vidal, cultural figures like Francisco Alonso Liongson, and academics like Guillermo G√≥mez Rivera and Miguel Bernad. # Guillermo G√≥mez Rivera # Edmundo Farol√°n # Fidel Villarroel, O.P. # Ram√≥n A.

Typical illustrations are in watercolour, but may also be in oils, ink or pencil, or a combination of these. The image may be life size or not, the scale is often shown, and may show the habit and habitat of the plant, the upper and reverse sides of leaves, and details of flowers, bud, seed and root system. Botanical illustration is sometimes used as a type for attribution of a botanical name to a taxon. The inability of botanists to conserve certain dried specimens, or restrictions on safe transport, have meant illustrations have been nominated as the type for some names. Many minute plants, which may only be viewed under a microscope, are often identified by an illustration to overcome the difficulties in using slide mounted specimens. The standards for this are by international agreement (Art 37.5 of the Vienna Code, 2006)... History The use of illustrations was frequently seen in the herbals, seed catalogues and popular works of natural history. The illustrations produced during the eighteenth and nineteenth century are regarded as both appealing and scientifically valid. The finer detail of the printing processes, greatly improving at this time, allowed artists such as Franz and Ferdinand Bauer to depict the minute aspects of the subject. The use of exploded details would further illustrate the description given in the accompanying text. These details allowed a non scientific audience to go some way in identifying the species, the widening interest in natural history and horticulture was an inducement to the production of many Floras and regular publications. Many books and publication continued to use the illustrators, even after printed matter began to incorporate photography. It would be many years before the colour printing would equal the illustrators plates. The accuracy and craft of the illustrators had developed in tandem with the botanists concerned, the work came to be accepted as important to the botanists and their institutions. The illustrated publication, Curtis's Botanical Magazine (1787), was to eventually appoint an official artist. The 230-year-old magazine, long associated with the Linnaean Society and Kew Gardens, is now primarily one of finer botanical illustration. A stream of the finest illustrators to appear in print have been featured in the magazine. The contribution of botanical illustrators continues to be praised and sought and very fine examples continue to be produced. In the 1980s, Celia Rosser undertook to illustrate every Banksia species for the masterwork, The Banksias. When another species was described after its publication, Banksia rosserae, it was named to honour her mammoth accomplishment. Other illustrators, such as the profuse illustrator Matilda Smith, have been specifically honoured for this work. In 1972 the Smithsonian Institution hired its first botanical illustrator, Alice Tangerini.

WGKV applied to upgrade to 250 watts in December 1941, but it would have to wait for World War II to end before the Federal Communications Commission granted the increase on January 16, 1946. During that time, however, more serious problems emerged that had the station in a fight for its legal life. In late 1943, Worth Kramer, who was about to be inducted into the Army, filed to relinquish control in Kanawha Valley, and the FCC ordered a hearing on alleged \\"hidden ownership\\". The war would soon take a larger toll on WGKV when four station employees were called to serve at the same time on February 1, 1944, leaving the outlet without its manager, women's director, promotions manager, and replacement all joined the armed forces and the Red Cross. Even when the war ended, the station's license renewal remained pending at the FCC; the hidden ownership allegations, concerning John A. Kennedy, had also put the license of WGKV's only competitor, WCHS, in doubt. A former secretary testified that Kennedy had secretly paid original station owner W. A. Carroll to build WGKV and asked that his involvement be concealed. In December 1947, the FCC proposed denying WGKV a renewal of its license. The station appealed, calling the action an unjust punishment, as WCHS had its license renewed at the same time. The station charged that new proposed owners, Eugene R. Custer and Richard M. Venable, had relied on the advice of Worth Kramer and his counsel, in a fashion similar to that charged against WCHS. The commission ultimately approved the license renewal and related transfers of control, finding that Venable and Custer were \\"almost wholly ignorant of the field of radio broadcasting\\" and of FCC regulations, relying entirely on Kramer and counsel and later being cooperative with the hearing proceeding. WGKV launched an FM companion, WGKV-FM 98.5, on September 24, 1949, marking its 10th anniversary of broadcasting. The FM station operated for more than five years and was deleted at the station's request on November 8, 1954. Earlier that year, an entirely new ownership group, associated with WSAZ (930 AM) and WSAZ-TV channel 3 at Huntington, had acquired the station from Venable and associates for $75,000. =WHMS and second stint as WGKV= In 1956, WSAZ sold WGKV for $90,000 to Jake and Walter Evans; the sale was necessary because WSAZ was buying WKNA (1240 AM) and WKNA-FM 97.5. The station was relocated to the Professional Building after 16 years in the Empire Building, and after a second sale to Joseph Brechner, the station changed its call letters to WHMS on February 1, 1958; letterhead boasted that the calls stood for \\"West Virginia's Hit Music Station\\". The new designation came with a revamped popular music format. Robert V. Barron, a Charleston native who went on to be a TV and film director in Hollywood, worked at several local radio stations, including WGKV/WHMS. Edgar Clinton bought WHMS in 1961. The license carried the call letters WTGR from July to November of that year, but the station continued to promote itself as WHMS. The call letters were retired again on February 20, 1962, this time reverting to the former WGKV call sign. The next year, it was approved to increase daytime power to 1,000 watts. =WXIT= In 1968, David Steere of Kalamazoo, Michigan, acquired WGKV for $250,000. Steere took over on January 15, 1969, and on February 10, WGKV became WXIT. The station billed itself as \\"The POPular Sound in Charleston\\", airing a Top 40 format. It aggressively competed with WKAZ (950 AM), a 5,000-watt outlet, for the youth audience. Kanawha Broadcasting Corporation acquired WXIT in 1978. The station was sold to Empire Broadcasting System, Inc., in 1987; separately, Empire bought WVCM (107.3 FM), licensed to nearby Miami. =WCZR and WSWW= WXIT became WCZR in 1990, named for and utilizing the satellite Z Rock syndicated network. Two years later, it flipped to talk, adding gospel and R&B; music in 1994. In 1995, the station dropped its talk programming and went full-time gospel/R&B;, under a new LMA with Kingdom Broadcasting. Kingdom was owned by local Black pastor Matthew J. Watts. In 1997, West Virginia Radio Corporation, which already owned four stations in Charleston, acquired WCZR and WKAZ-FM for $2.14 million. The station flipped to sports and adopted the call letters WSWW, going by the name \\"3WS\\".

Prior to the Muslim conquest of Syria in the 630s, the Kalb's territory spanned much of northwestern Arabia, the Palmyrene steppe, the Samawah (desert between Palmyra and the Euphrates), the Hawran plain and the Golan Heights. One of their main centers was the desert town of Dumat al-Jandal. The Kalb were involved in the tribal affairs of the eastern frontiers of the Byzantine Empire from the 4th century and were likely the tribe of Mavia, the Bedouin queen of southern Syria. By the 6th century, the Kalb had largely become Monophysite Christians and came under the military authority of the Ghassanids, Arab vassals of the Byzantines. During the lifetime of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, a number of his close companions were Kalb tribesmen, such as Zayd ibn Harithah and Dihya al-Kalbi, but the bulk of the tribe remained Christian at the time of Muhammad's death in 632. The Kalb formed political and marital ties with the Umayyad family, and were the main source of military and political power during the reigns of the Umayyad caliphs Mu'awiya I, Yazid I, Mu'awiya II and Marwan I. During early Umayyad rule the Kalb became a chief belligerent in the long-running Qays‚ÄìYaman feud as the leading tribe of the Yaman. Under their leadership, the Yaman dealt a heavy blow to the Qays at the Battle of Marj Rahit in 684. By then the Kalb were largely concentrated in the steppe around Homs and Palmyra and were driven out of the Samawah in the late 680s by the Qays. Origins The Kalb were traditionally held to be from Quda'a.F√ºck 1997, p. 492. Kalb, whose name means \\"dog\\" in Arabic, was the tribe's progenitor. The latter's father was a certain Wabara and his mother was known as Umm al-Asbu ø because all of her children were named after wild animals. According to traditional Arab genealogy, Kalb was descended from the semi- legendary patriarch of the southern Arabs, ·∏§imyar, via the Kalb's ancestral tribe, Quda'ah;Landau-Tasseron, ed. Yar-Shater 1998, p. 6. the latter was a large confederation with numerous branches whose tribesmen lived as far north as Syria, possibly as early as the 4th century CE.Shahid 1986, p. 388. Pre- Islamic era The Kalb were a Bedouin (nomadic) tribe well known for camel raising. In the centuries prior to the advent of Islam (pre-7th century), the tribe's grazing grounds were in northwestern Arabia,Shahid 1986, p. 146. and the vast desert steppe between Syria and Mesopotamia, known as SamƒÅwaShahid 1986, p. 197. or SamƒÅwat Kalb. That region essentially consisted of the larger, southern part of the Syrian Desert. The Kalb's principal centers were the oases in the low-lying region formed by the Wadi Sirhan in the west and al-Jawf in the east. The Kalb long dominated al-Jawf prior to the Muslim conquest.Sudayri 1995, p. 81. The Kalb's tribal territory was bordered on the north by the powerful Tayy tribe, close allies of the Kalb, and to the southeast, west and east were the tribes of Ghatafan, Banu al-Qayn and Annazah, respectively. The Kalb's domination of Wadi Sirhan and al-Jawf allowed for many of their tribesmen's migration northward into Syria. The Kalb may have arrived in Syria by the 4th century CE, though \\"precise and certain information on its role\\" in Syria \\"in the fourth century is not available\\", according to historian Irfan Shahid. However, Shahid asserts that it was likely that Mavia, a warrior queen of Arab tribesmen in southern Syria, was a member of the Kalb.Shahid 1986, p. 196. This indicates that the Kalb were allies of Mavia's principal force, the Tanukhids. The latter, like the Kalb, also traced their descent to Quda'ah.Bosworth, ed. Yar-Shater 1999, p. 20. By then, the Kalb's encampments spanned the steppes between the Palmyrena and Tabuk in the northern Hejaz. The Kalb's territory on the Byzantine Empire's Limes Arabicus frontier straddled the Oriens, a collective term for the empire's eastern provinces.Shahid 1989, p. 24. In Syria, the Kalb were settled in Palmyra, Salamiyah, the Ghuta and Mezzeh hinterlands of Damascus, the Golan Heights, the Hawran plain and the hills of as-Suwayda, and to a lesser extent in the neighborhood of Homs, Aleppo, Hama and Manbij. In northern Arabia, they were present in the towns of Dumat al-Jandal, Tayma, al-Hirah and Fadak. The Kalb may have been the unnamed tribe that launched a massive invasion of Byzantine-held Syria, Phoenicia, Palestine and Egypt in 410, according to Shahid. Shahid argues that the Kalbid invasion was possibly related to the fall of the Kalb's Tanukhid allies and the latter's replacement as the Byzantine's main foederati with the Salihids, which also descended from the Quda'ah.Shahid 1989, p. 235. In the closing years of the 5th century,Shahid 1989, p. 86. tensions between the Kalb and the Salihids culminated in a day- long battle in which the Salihid phylarch, Dawud, was killed by Tha'laba ibn 'Amir of Kalb and his ally Mu'awiya ibn Hujayr of Namir in the Golan region.Shahid 1989, pp. 258‚Äì259. It is not clear if the conflict between Tha'laba ibn 'Amir and Dawud was a personal feud or part of a tribal conflict between the Kalb and the Salihids.Shahid, p. 260. Though the Kalb's role in 5th-century Arab tribal politics in the Byzantine Empire is clear, contemporary sources do not indicate how early the Kalb made contact with the Byzantines.Shahid 1989, p. 272. By the early 6th century, the Salihids were supplanted by the Ghassanids as the supreme phylarchs of the Arab tribes in Byzantine territory. Like the Ghassanids, the Kalb embraced Monophysite Christianity.Shahid 1989, p. 314. The Kalb were put under the Ghassanids' authority and were charged with guarding the Byzantines' eastern frontier against Sassanian Persia and the latter's Arab vassals in al-Hirah, the Lakhmids. As a result of their firm incorporation in the Byzantine foederati system, the Kalb \\"became accustomed to military discipline and to law and order\\", according to historian Johann F√ºck. The most well-known early chieftain of the Kalb was Zuhayr ibn Janab al-Kalbi, who wielded significant influence among the Bedouin tribes of northern Arabia. On behalf of Abraha, the mid-6th-century Ethiopian viceroy of south Arabia, Zuhayr led an expedition against the north Arabian tribes of Taghlib and Bakr. In the mid-6th century, the Kalb led by Zuhayr fought against the Banu Baghid clan of the Ghatafan tribe over the latter's construction of a haram (sacred place) at a place called \\"Buss\\"; the Ghatafan's haram emulated the Ka'aba of Mecca, at the time a widely honored edifice containing pagan Arabian idols, which offended the powerful tribes of the area, including the Kalb. Zuhayr decisively defeated the Ghatafan and had their haram destroyed. Islamic era =Early Muslim campaigns= During the early years of Islam's advent in Arabia, a number of individual Kalbid tribesmen in Mecca converted to the religion, including Zayd ibn Dihyah al-Kalbi, Muhammad's emissary to the Byzantine emperor, Heraclius. According to historian Fred Donner, while there were notable individual converts to Islam among the Kalb, there are scarce details about contacts between Muhammad and the Kalb in general.Donner 1981, p. 106. As Byzantine foederati, the Kalb fought against Muslim advances in northern Arabia and Syria. The first confrontation was the 626/27 Expedition of 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf in which the Muslims led by Iyad ibn Ghanm defeated the Kalb.Shahid, p. 304. In general, the Muslim accounts agree that after the battle, the Christian Kalb tribesmen of Dumat al-Jandal led by al-Asbagh ibn Amr, converted to Islam and made an alliance with the Muhammad.Homoud 1994, p. 179.Donner 1981, pp. 106‚Äì107. However, Donner writes that Muslim accounts regarding the Dumat al-Jandal expeditions and the alliance with its leader \\"have been criticized as unreliable\\".Donner 1981, p. 107. It is apparent, however, there were contacts between Muhammad and some clans of the Kalb. Moreover, at least part of the Kalb of the Syrian steppe came under a Muslim agent during the campaign against Dhat al-Salasil in southern Mesopotamia. Nonetheless, the majority of the Kalb remained outside the emerging Muslim state's authority at the time of Muhammad's death in 632. Kalbid tribesmen who may have embraced Islam do not appear to have participated in the Muslim conquest of Syria. During the conquest, in 634, the Kalb were among the Arab Christian tribes that were defeated by Khalid ibn al-Walid at Ziza in Transjordan.Blankinship, ed. Yar-Shater 1993, p. 76. =Umayyad era= Banu Haritha in Janab, included Bahdal ibn Unayf, Maysun bint Bahdal and Hassan ibn Malik The Muslim conquest of Syria was concluded by 638; by then, the Kalb inhabited the steppes around Homs and Palmyra and were the leaders and most powerful component of the Quda'ah tribal confederation. The Kalb had relations with the Umayyads, a clan of Quraysh, since the reign of Caliph Uthman (r. 644‚Äì656),Dixon 1978, pp. 493‚Äì494. who married a Kalbid woman, Na'ilah bint al- Farafisah, with whom he had a daughter, Maryam (Umm al-Banin).Humphreys, ed. Yar-Shater 1990, p. 254. During the conflict between Muawiyah I, the Muslim governor of Syria who belonged to the Umayyads, and Caliph Ali (r. 656‚Äì661), the Kalb provided critical support for Mu'awiyah. The latter married two Kalbid women, including Maysun, the daughter of Bahdal ibn Unayf, the Kalb's preeminent chieftain, who remained Christian until his death sometime before 657.Kennedy, p. 80. Bahdal's sons and grandsons served as commanders on the Umayyad side against Ali's partisans during the Battle of Siffin in 657. Ali was ultimately defeated and Mu'awiyah came to rely on the Kalb, one of the principal sources of military power in Syria, for maintaining his foothold in Syria. With this, the Kalb specifically, and the Yamani tribal coalition in general, became the most influential group during the Sufyanid period (661‚Äì684) of the Umayyad Caliphate. Mu'awiyah's son and successor, Yazid I (r. 680‚Äì683), who was born to Maysun, also married a Kalbid woman. The accession of Yazid's son Mu'awiyah II (r. 683‚Äì684) was largely due to the machinations of the Kalbid chieftain, Hassan ibn Malik ibn Bahdal.Kennedy, p. 78. However, Mu'awiyah II soon died, leaving the caliphate in political disarray. Ibn Bahdal favored anointing one of Yazid's young sons to succeed Mu'awiyah, while the governor of Kufa, Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, favored an Umayyad from a different branch of the ruling family, Marwan ibn al-Hakam. Meanwhile, the rebel Abdullah ibn Zubayr from Hejaz challenged Umayyad leadership and was gaining support in Syria. Dedicated to preserving the political and economic privileges the Kalb acquired under the Sufyanids, Ibn Bahdal firmly backed the continuation of Umayyad rule. Ibn Bahdal threw his support behind Marwan, while al-Dahhak ibn Qays al-Fihri, a chieftain of the Yaman's Qaysi rivals, backed Ibn Zubayr.Kennedy, p. 79. Ibn Bahdal mobilized the Kalb and their Yamani partners and routed the Qays in the Battle of Marj Rahit in August 684. In the battle's aftermath, the Qays‚ÄìYaman feud intensified, while Marwan became completely dependent on the Yaman to maintain his rule; just prior to Marj Rahit, Marwan agreed to the Kalb's conditions, including that 2,000 of their chiefs would receive an annual, hereditary salary of 2,000 silver dirhams for military service, priority in Marwan's court, and consultation in all major government decisions. Qaysi revenge against the Kalb and Umayyads took place during the 686 Battle of al-Khazir, during which the Qaysi general, Umayr ibn al-Hubab of Sulaym abandoned the Umayyad army, which was then defeated by the Zubayrids. Umayr took refuge with the Qaysi chief Zufar ibn al-Harith of Kilab in al-Qarqisiyah, and afterward a series of raids and counter-raids took place between the Kalb and the Qays. The Kalb, led by Humayd ibn Hurayth ibn Bahdal, were frequently attacked by the Qays at their dwelling places in the Samawah desert. Despite making retaliatory raids, the Kalb of Samawah were forced to flee for the Jordan Valley. Humayd attacked the Qays in Upper Mesopotamia, but was ultimately defeated during the battle of Banat Qayn in Samawah, the last of the major Qaysi‚ÄìYamani day-long clashes (ayyam). Kalbid relations with the Umayyad state deteriorated under Caliph Marwan II (r. 744‚Äì750) as the latter relied almost entirely on the Qays for military and administrative support at the expense of Yamani interests. In June 745, a Kalbid chieftain of Palmyra, al-Asbagh ibn Dhu'alah al-Kalbi, led a revolt against Marwan II in Homs.Williams, pp. 4‚Äì5. His tribesmen and their Yamani allies fought the caliph's force in the streets of Homs, but were forced to retreat. Al-Asbagh's sons Dhu'alah and Furafisah were captured and executed, along with thirty other Kalbid and Yamani soldiers. With the advent of the Abbasid Revolution in 750, the Kalb may have realized Umayyad rule was close to collapse. Likely as a result of the aforementioned circumstances, 2,000 Kalbid tribesmen dispatched by Marwan II to reinforce the Umayyad governor of Basrah, defected to the Abbasid Caliphate instead. However, that same year, the Yaman, including the Kalb, grew frustrated with Abbasid rule in Syria and joined the revolt of Umayyad prince Abu Muhammad al-Sufyani and Qaysi general Abu al-Ward. Abu Muhammad was a descendant of the Kalb's former patron, Mu'awiyah I, and he presented himself as a messianic figure known as the \\"Sufyani\\", who many from Homs believed would restore the Umayyad Caliphate.Cobb, p. 47. Abu al-Ward was killed by an Abbasid army while Abu Muhammad and the Kalb barricaded themselves in Palmyra,Williams, p. 178. though Abu Muhammad later fled for Arabia.Cobb, p. 48. =Abbasid era= The Kalb's role in Syria declined under the Baghdad-based Abbasids. In the 860s, as Abbasid central control waned in the provinces, including Syria, the Kalb allied with Isa ibn al-Shaykh al-Shaybani, the Arab strongman of Palestine.Cobb, p. 39. In 884, the Kalb under Utayf ibn Ni'ma joined an anti- Abbasid revolt in Homs and killed that city's governor, al-Fadl ibn Karim. However, the Abbasids defeated the rebels and recaptured Homs. By the 10th century, the Kalb were one of the three largest Arab confederations of Syria and were largely concentrated in the central part of the region; the other two confederations were the Tayy in southern Syria and the Kilab in northern Syria.Salibi, p. 85. However, unlike the Tayy and Kilab, who were relative newcomers to Syria, most of the long-established Kalb tribesmen were settled peasants who lost their traditional nomadic mobility by this time. Because of their inclination toward sedentarism, the Kalb gradually lost their dominant position in the al-Jawf and Wadi Sirhan regions to their Tayy allies, while those who remained nomadic either migrated to join their kinsmen in central Syria or kept a low profile in their traditional dwelling places.Sudairi, p. 83. Also unlike the Tayy and Kilab, the Kalb in central Syria had lost their tribal connections in the neighboring regions. However certain Kalb clans, particularly in the Samawah, found a strong patron in the Qarmatian movement. The Banu Ulays and Banu al-Asbagh branches of the Kalb embraced the Qarmatian leader Yahya ibn Zikrawayh, and together, they ambushed an Abbasid army and killed its commander, Sabuk al-Daylami in 901. Afterward, they raided several villages on their way to Damascus, where they burned down the al-Rusafa Mosque. Yahya was killed by the Tulunids, after which the Kalb joined Yahya's brother, al-Husayn ibn Zikrawayh. Under al-Husayn, the Kalb‚ÄìQarmatian alliance defeated Tulunid armies until al-Husayn was captured and executed in 903 by order of Caliph al-Muqtafi. The Banu al-Asbagh and Banu Ulays remained loyal to the Qarmatians and were joined by another branch of the Kalb, the Banu Ziyad. Under the Qarmatian leader Abu Ghanim Nasr, they raided Damascus, Bosra, Adhri'at and Tiberias, and killed the deputy governor of Jund al- Urdunn. This prompted al-Muqtafi to dispatch a punitive expedition led by Husayn ibn Hamdan against the Kalb, but the Kalb and the Asad, defeated Hamdan, forcing him to flee to Aleppo. Later that year, Ibn Hamdan defeated the Kalb and their Tayy allies. The Kalb then raided places in the Samawah and attacked Hit. Al-Muqtafi responded by sending an army led by Muhammad ibn Ishaq ibn Kundaj, which compelled the Kalb to betray the Qarmatians and kill Nasr, thereby avoiding punitive action by the authorities. Nonetheless, with the decisive defeat of the Qarmatians by the Abbasids in the 970s, the Kalb's newfound strength had largely diminished. During the reign of Caliph al- Mustarshid (1118‚Äì1135), the Kalb betrayed the Mazyadid leader, Dubays ibn Sadaqa, to the governor of Damascus.

Edeson was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, the son of manager and actor George R. Edeson. After working as treasurer of the Park Theatre in Brooklyn, he initially acted in New York in 1887 in a production of Fascination. He debuted on Broadway in Marriage (1896). His last Broadway appearance was in The World We Live In (1922). He also performed in vaudeville. Edeson received his first boost in films in 1914 when he starred in the Cecil B. DeMille directed film, The Call of the North (1914). Edeson replaced actor Rudolph Christians in Erich von Stroheim's production of Foolish Wives (1922), after Christians died of pneumonia. Edeson famously only showed his back to the camera so as not to clash with shot footage of Christians that was still to be used in the completed film. Edeson's final film was Aloha (1931). His third wife was the former Aida Banker. On March 24, 1931, Edeson died at his home in Hollywood. He was 62 years old.

Motivation One motivation for considering this series to be analogous to the exponential function comes from infinite products. In the ring of formal power series Qx we have the identity ::e^x = \\\\prod_{n \\\\geq 1}(1-x^n)^{-\\\\mu(n)/n}, where Œº(n) is the M√∂bius function. This identity can be verified by showing the logarithmic derivative of the two sides are equal and that both sides have the same constant term. In a similar way, one can verify a product expansion for the Artin‚ÄìHasse exponential: ::E_p(x) = \\\\prod_{(p,n)=1}(1-x^n)^{-\\\\mu(n)/n}. So passing from a product over all n to a product over only n prime to p, which is a typical operation in p-adic analysis, leads from ex to Ep(x).  Properties  The coefficients of Ep(x) are rational. We can use either formula for Ep(x) to prove that, unlike ex, all of its coefficients are p-integral; in other words, the denominators of the coefficients of Ep(x) are not divisible by p. A first proof uses the definition of Ep(x) and Dwork's lemma, which says that a power series f(x) = 1 + ... with rational coefficients has p-integral coefficients if and only if f(xp)/f(x)p ‚â° 1 mod pZpx. When f(x) = Ep(x), we have f(xp)/f(x)p = e‚àípx, whose constant term is 1 and all higher coefficients are in pZp. A second proof comes from the infinite product for Ep(x): each exponent -Œº(n)/n for n not divisible by p is a p-integral, and when a rational number a is p-integral all coefficients in the binomial expansion of (1 - xn)a are p-integral by p-adic continuity of the binomial coefficient polynomials t(t-1)...(t-k+1)/k! in t together with their obvious integrality when t is a nonnegative integer (a is a p-adic limit of nonnegative integers) . Thus each factor in the product of Ep(x) has p-integral coefficients, so Ep(x) itself has p-integral coefficients. The (p-integral) series expansion has radius of convergence 1. Combinatorial interpretation The Artin‚ÄìHasse exponential is the generating function for the probability a uniformly randomly selected element of Sn (the symmetric group with n elements) has p-power order (the number of which is denoted by tp,n): :E_p(x)=\\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 0} \\\\frac{t_{p,n}}{n!}x^n. This gives a third proof that the coefficients of Ep(x) are p-integral, using the theorem of Frobenius that in a finite group of order divisible by d the number of elements of order dividing d is also divisible by d. Apply this theorem to the nth symmetric group with d equal to the highest power of p dividing n!. More generally, for any topologically finitely generated profinite group G there is an identity :\\\\exp(\\\\sum_{H \\\\subset G} x^{[G:H]}/[G:H])=\\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 0} \\\\frac{a_{G,n}}{n!}x^n, where H runs over open subgroups of G with finite index (there are finitely many of each index since G is topologically finitely generated) and aG,n is the number of continuous homomorphisms from G to Sn. Two special cases are worth noting. (1) If G is the p-adic integers, it has exactly one open subgroup of each p-power index and a continuous homomorphism from G to Sn is essentially the same thing as choosing an element of p-power order in Sn, so we have recovered the above combinatorial interpretation of the Taylor coefficients in the Artin‚ÄìHasse exponential series. (2) If G is a finite group then the sum in the exponential is a finite sum running over all subgroups of G, and continuous homomorphisms from G to Sn are simply homomorphisms from G to Sn. The result in this case is due to Wohlfahrt (1977). The special case when G is a finite cyclic group is due to Chowla, Herstein, and Scott (1952), and takes the form :\\\\exp(\\\\sum_{dm} x^d/d)=\\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 0} \\\\frac{a_{m,n}}{n!}x^n, where am,n is the number of solutions to gm = 1 in Sn. David Roberts provided a natural combinatorial link between the Artin‚ÄìHasse exponential and the regular exponential in the spirit of the ergodic perspective (linking the p-adic and regular norms over the rationals) by showing that the Artin‚ÄìHasse exponential is also the generating function for the probability that an element of the symmetric group is unipotent in characteristic p, whereas the regular exponential is the probability that an element of the same group is unipotent in characteristic zero. Conjectures At the 2002 PROMYS program, Keith Conrad conjectured that the coefficients of E_p(x) are uniformly distributed in the p-adic integers with respect to the normalized Haar measure, with supporting computational evidence. The problem is still open. Dinesh Thakur has also posed the problem of whether the Artin‚ÄìHasse exponential reduced mod p is transcendental over \\\\mathbb{F}_p(x).

(The original SRS patents are , and , which expired between 2006 and 2008. Patents may apply in other countries). The SRS technology applies head- related transfer functions (HRTFs) to create an immersive 3D soundfield using only two speakers, widening the \\"sweet spot\\", creating a more spacious sense of ambience, and producing strong localization cues for discrete instruments within an audio mix.Audio Basics newsletter, vol 10, (double) number 5 and 6, May and June 1991, pp2-3 SRS is not a Dolby matrix surround decoder but works with normal stereo recordings. Initially Hughes Aircraft, for whom Klayman was doing acoustic consulting at the time, offered a standalone SRS audio processor, as well as licensing the technology to Sony and Thomson (RCA) for inclusion in their products. In the early 1990s, Hughes sold off its non- aerospace-related holdings, and a group of entrepreneurs formed SRS Labs to acquire the SRS technology. Many TV sets employ built-in SRS to make their built-in audio systems sound \\"bigger\\". An article in the November 1994 issue of Consumers Digest magazine tested several SRS-equipped sets from Sony and other manufacturers and concluded that the circuit was essentially a gimmick in these products due to their small, close-set speakers and low-wattage amplifiers. SRS is not a panacea for audio systems that are marginal to begin with; it works best with full-range, high-fidelity sound reproduction. The company (publicly traded on NASDAQ under the symbol SRSL after a 1996 IPO) since developed or acquired several additional audio technologies, including SRS Headphone, TruSurround XT, TruBass (\\"psychoacoustic bass enhancement to enable deeper, natural bass of audio source material to be perceived over small speaker drivers\\"), FOCUS (\\"sound-image elevation used in combination with SRS to create a large sound image\\", originally conceived for in-car listening), SRS Virtual Surround, Circle Surround, SRS Wow (an audio- enhancement suite made up of SRS 3D \\"wide stereo imaging and nonfatiguing headphone listening mode\\", Focus and TruBassSRS Labs Wow technology explained, 14 November 2005) and SRS Wow HD, Dialog Clarity, and VIP, most using psychoacoustic principles similar to those employed by the SRS technology. SRS or one of its derivatives is offered in products from a wide range of professional and consumer audio manufacturers as well as in SRS's own small stable of products. The company derives most of its revenue from licensing its technologies, which it does in both silicon and software form. SRS Wow was implemented in many devices such as music players, and in software such as Microsoft's Windows Media Player for playing sound on a computer.Microsoft: Changing bass, stereo and other audio effects in Windows Media Player \\"You can enhance low-frequency and stereo sound performance by turning on SRS WOW effects\\".

It was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1962. History An anti-submarine net running between York Redoubt and McNab's Island in 1942 York Redoubt was a key element in the defence of Halifax Harbour in the 19th and 20th centuries, and saw many additions to its fortifications. It was a command centre for the local harbour defences in World War II, which included observation posts, a defensive minefield and a new gun battery below the fort at Sleepy Cove covering the anti-submarine net which stretched across the harbour's entrance from Fort McNab on McNabs Island. York Redoubt remained in military use until 1956. Buildings in the redoubt complex include what remains of the Duke of York's Martello tower, built in 1798; other fortifications from around 1800 and 1900; and advanced fortifications and artillery from World War II. York Redoubt has many examples of rifled muzzle loader cannon from the 1870s period. An open-air collection of unmounted cannon within the fort has several pieces of artillery of various periods, including a large 9.62-inch breech loader that had been mounted at the Sandwich Point battery, part of the York Redoubt complex. Structures at the water's edge at Sleepy Cove battery, now closed to the public, include three search light batteries, two concrete lookout towers and two gun emplacements which originally held two 12-pounder guns, but were later replaced with 6 pounder guns.

He is a co-founder of The People Yes! Network (TPYN) and the former Director of the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions (ICAHD). Halper has written several books on the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict and is a frequent writer and speaker about Israeli politics, focusing mainly on nonviolent strategies to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He is a supporter of the BDS movement and the academic boycott of Israel, and considers Israel to be guilty of \\"apartheid\\" and of a deliberate campaign to \\"judaize\\" the occupied Palestinian territories. In 1997, Halper co-founded ICAHD to challenge and resist the Israeli policy of demolishing Palestinian homes in the Occupied Territories and to organize Israelis, Palestinians and international volunteers to jointly rebuild demolished Palestinian homes as political acts of resistance (ICAHD has rebuilt 189 Palestinian homes). Halper was nominated, together with the Palestinian intellectual and activist Ghassan Andoni, for the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize by the American Friends Service Committee for his work \\"to liberate both the Palestinian and the Israeli people from the yoke of structural violence\\" and \\"to build equality between their people by recognizing and celebrating their common humanity.\\" In 2013 Halper initiated, with a group of international activists, The People Yes! Network, intended to provide an \\"infrastructure\\" that will enable left and progressive groups to find each other across issues and geography, communicate, coordinate, share analyses and materials, and plan joint campaigns, especially around global issues. The ultimate goal of TPYN is to generate a conception of a just, inclusive, pluralistic and sustainable post-capitalist, \\"human-centric\\" (or \\"life- centric\\") world system and to help create the global movement that would bring it into being. Early career Halper was born in Boston in 1946 but grew up in Hibbing, Minnesota. He received his B.A. from Macalester College and his Ph.D. in Cultural and Applied Anthropology from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee. During the 1960s Halper was active in the civil rights movement and the anti-Vietnam War movement, resisting military service in the war. By contrast, in a 2010 interview, Halper said: \\"I don't talk about it that much but I did go into the Israeli army ... I did reserve duty like everybody else for twenty some years.\\" Halper emigrated to Israel in 1973. In his 2008 memoir, Halper says that upon arrival in Israel \\"I suppose you could have called me a 'Zionist.' \\" Until witnessing a house demolition in 'Anata in the West Bank in 1998, Halper described himself, as \\"a Jew who had emigrated to Israel from the United States 25 years earlier\\" who \\"generally subscribed to what may be described as Zionist principles ...\\" Halper says: \\"I took umbrage to Mazzini's famous dictum: 'Without Country you are the bastards of Humanity.' That alone seemed enough to me to justify the existence of Israel as a Jewish state while subordinating Palestinian claims to the historical necessity of Jews to control their own destiny.\\" Although, in his 2010 interview, Halper claimed: \\"I came with my eyes open. I never came [to Israel] as a Zionist.\\" Halper served as an adjunct lecturer in anthropology at the University of Haifa and at Ben Gurion University, though most of his academic career was spent at Friends World College (FWC). He was director of FWC's Middle East Center in Jerusalem, and when FWC merged with Long Island University in 1991, he became Director of its International Academic Operations and was promoted to the rank of associate professor. His academic research focuses on the history of modern Jerusalem, contemporary Israeli culture, and the Middle East conflict. In addition to teaching and research, Halper is involved in issues of social justice activism in Israel. He spent ten years as a community volunteer in Jerusalem's inner city neighborhoods, and was a founder of Ohel - a social protest movement of working-class Mizrahi Jews. He served as the chairman of the Israeli Association for Ethiopian Jews, having been active in the 1960s in championing the rights of Ethiopian Jews and in researching the history of the Jewish community in Ethiopia. Founding of ICAHD Halper co-founded the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions (ICAHD) in 1997 to resist Israel's occupation and to work for a just peace between Israelis and Palestinians. ICAHD took as its vehicle of resistance the Israeli government's policy of demolishing Palestinian homes in the Occupied Territories (more than 47,000 since 1967, according to ICAHD), only a little more than 1% being demolished for security reasons. Many of the homes are demolished as \\"collateral damage\\" in military operations (18,000 in the 2014 attack on Gaza alone), others because Israel uses discriminatory planning and zoning policies to restrict the granting of building permits, virtually freezing Palestinian building in 1967, demolishing them when Palestinian are forced to build \\"illegally.\\" The objective for this, according to Halper, is not to ensure security for Israeli citizens but simply to confine residents in the West Bank and East Jerusalem to small, impoverished, and disconnected enclaves, leaving most of the land free for Israeli settlement and annexation. As ICAHD's Coordinating Director, Halper has organized and led direct action in opposition to Israeli policies. He has faced IDF bulldozers coming to demolish Palestinian homes, and he organizes, in the framework of ICAHD, Palestinians, Israelis and internationals to rebuild demolished Palestinian homes. Typically, ICAHD will get a call from a Palestinian family informing it that bulldozers have arrived. ICAHD thereupon sends out an action alert, in response to which activists from different groups turn out and engage in civil disobedience by standing up to the bulldozers. ICAHD also raises funds to rebuild these homes in their original locations. In addition, under Halper's leadership, ICAHD encourages dialogue between groups in an effort to open communication, foster reconciliation and challenge stereotypes. ICAHD works in coalition with a wide range of left-wing Israeli organizations including: Rabbis for Human Rights, the Alternative Information Center and Ta'ayush, as well as Palestinian groups such as the Land Defense Committee, the Palestinian Agricultural Relief Committee (PARC) and BADIL Resource Center for Palestinian Residency and Refugee Rights. \\"The Palestinian population in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including occupied and illegally annexed East Jerusalem,\\" according to the ICAHD, \\"continues to endure violence, displacement, dispossession and deprivation as a result of prolonged Israeli occupation, in most cases in violation of their rights under international law. In the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, demolitions are a major cause of the destruction of property, including residential and livelihood-related structures, and displacement.\\" The organization describes Israel's demolition campaign as breaking into three stages. Stage 1, \\"Inside Israel\\" (1948-1960s), involved the destruction of Palestinian villages and urban neighborhoods \\" so that the refugees could not return and their lands could be turned over to the Jewish population.\\" Stage 2, \\"In the Occupied Territories\\" (since 1967), removed homes in the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza. And Stage 3, \\"Back Inside Israel\\" (1990s-present), involves demolition \\"at an ever accelerating rate.\\" Halper has been arrested numerous times by Israeli authorities for protesting the demolition of Palestinian homes. \\"As Israelis, we are privileged,\\" he said after one arrest. \\"They [the police] are not going to shoot us if we resist the demolition, but if a Palestinian had done it, they would have certainly shot him.\\" \\"ICAHD staff and activists,\\" explains the organization's website, \\"embark on extensive speaking tours abroad at the invitation of our international partners, participate in international conferences and gatherings, and appear frequently in the international media. Besides our work with our international partners, we meet with government officials and diplomats, both in Israel/Palestine and in their capitals, in an effort to affect their governments' policies.\\" ICAHD says that the \\"overall objective\\" of its \\"intergovernmental organization work is to ensure that the protection and promotion of Palestinian rights and a just peace become an essential component of international relations in a consistent, principled and effective way.\\" ICAHD has observer status in the UN and regularly interacts with the UN Human Rights Council, Special Rapporteurs, the High Commissioner for Human Rights and other international bodies. ICAHD offers a variety of \\"alternative\\" tours of Israel and Palestine, during which visitors can \\"meet Palestinian families suffering under Israeli policies of separation and home demolitions\\" as well as see \\"how Israel's settlement project has created irreversible ‚Äòfacts on the ground.'\\" ICAHD has branches in the United Kingdom, the US, Finland, Norway, Germany and Australia. Donors to ICAHD have included Trocaire, NGO Development Center, United Nations Development Programme, World Vision, Mennonite Central Committee, the European Union, and the government of Spain. ICAHD was awarded UN Economic and Social Council Special Consultative Status in 2010. Activism related to Israel and the Palestinians Halper has frequently appeared alongside Rev. Naim Ateek, the head of Sabeel, a Palestinian Liberation Theology group based in Jerusalem. \\"As a Jew and an Israeli,\\" wrote Gerald M. Steinberg of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, \\"Halper's appearances are seen as providing 'legitimacy' for Sabeel's extremist agenda, in the form of a counter to allegations of anti-Semitic motivations.\\" Halper was a \\"member of the support committee\\" for the Russell Tribunal on Palestine.Members of the Support Committee, p. 13 He has taught at universities in Israel, the US, Latin America and Africa. Halper participated in the first Free Gaza Movement voyage in 2008 which broke the Israeli siege of Gaza. He was arrested by Israeli authorities after the trip when he tried to reenter Israel. He was the only Israeli and one of four Israeli citizens on the ship. He explained his reason for participating as \\"I cannot stand idly aside. I can no more passively witness my government‚Äôs destruction of another people than I can watch the occupation destroy the moral fabric of my own country. To do so would violate my commitment to human rights, the very essence of prophetic Jewish religion, culture and morals, without which Israel is no longer Jewish but an empty, if powerful, Sparta\\". In March 2010, Halper was a keynote speaker at Israel Apartheid Week in Glasgow. Halper's lecture was entitled \\"Israeli Apartheid: The Case For BDS,\\" during which he described the way that Palestinians are ‚Äòwarehoused' in Gaza. Views Halper supports the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement, saying in a July 2013 article that BDS has \\"generated meaningful pressure on governments to justly resolve the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict.\\" In the same article he set forth five criteria for a just solution to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict: #A just peace and the process leading up to it must conform to human rights, international law and UN resolutions. #Regardless of whether there should or should not have been an Israel, two peoples now reside in Palestine-Israel and a just peace must be based on that bi-national reality. #A just peace requires an acceptance of the Palestinian refugees' right of return. #A just peace must be economically viable, with all the country's inhabitants enjoying equal access to the country's resources and economic institutions. #A just peace must be regional in scope ‚Äì by itself Israel-Palestine is too small a unit to address all the issues at stake in the conflict‚Äîand it must address the security concerns of all in the region. Halper supports the academic boycott against Israel. Halper has often suggested that Israel is seeking to establish \\"facts on the ground,\\" as he routinely puts it, that would render territorial concessions in any peace agreement inconceivable. Halper takes a critical view of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. He has stated that \\"during the process where you're supposed to be negotiating peace\\" Israel, in fact, \\"doubled its settlement enterprise\\". \\"The crime of apartheid,\\" the ICAHD has said, \\"should be understood to mean inhumane acts committed in the context of an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any other racial group or groups and committed with the intention of maintaining that regime.\\" \\"The demolition of Palestinian homes and other structures, forced or resulting displacement, and land expropriation are politically and ethnically motivated,\\" the ICAHD has declared. \\"The goal is to limit development and confine the four million Palestinian residents of the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza to small enclaves, thus effectively foreclosing any viable, contiguous Palestinian state and ensuring Israeli control and the 'Judaization' of the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.\\" The ICAHD explains that \\"Judaization refers to the view that Israel has actively sought to transform the physical and demographic landscape to correspond with a vision of a united and fundamentally Jewish land under Israeli sovereignty in historic Palestine.\\" Halper declared in April 2012 that \\"a two-state solution is no longer viable.\\" For one thing, \\"the facts on the ground ‚Äì the settlements, the wall, the highways and the fragmentation of the territory ‚Äì are all just so massive and so permanent and are constantly being expanded that there's no more place for a coherent, functional, viable, sovereign Palestinian state.\\" For another, \\"there's no political will in the international community to force Israel out of the Occupied Territories.\\" He outlines \\"two possible one-state solutions,\\" one of them being \\"a democratic state with one person, one vote,\\" the other being \\"a bi-national one-state.\\" He also proposes a further possibility: \\"the idea of a Middle Eastern Economic Confederation that looks something like the European Common Market of 30 years ago\\" and that would include \\"Israel/Palestine, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.\\" In September 2012, ICAHD endorsed a bi-national, one-state solution, and in April 2013 Halper explained that a two-state solution was only possible if Israel accepted Palestinian sovereignty over the Occupied Territories, Palestinian UN membership, the Palestinian right to national self-determination within the 1967 lines, and the integration of settlements on Palestinian land. He declared that \\"[t]here is a remarkable, mirror-like correspondence between Hamas and the right-wing in Israel, the latter ranging from the Likud through the religious settler movement.\\" Honors and awards Halper was nominated, together with the Palestinian intellectual/activist Ghassan Andoni, for the Nobel Peace Prize by the American Friends Service Committee for his work \\"to liberate both the Palestinian and the Israeli people from the yoke of structural violence\\" and \\"to build equality between their people by recognizing and celebrating their common humanity.\\" In 2007, ICAHD received the Olive Branch Award from Jewish Voice for Peace.

The newspaper did not make a profit until 1918. In 1929, Paxton's son, Edwin J. Paxton, who had taken over as editor, bought out the rival News- Democrat. After the merger, the newspaper became The Sun-Democrat, and operations were moved to the current location at 408 Kentucky Avenue in 1934.

It is immediately south of the A. Murray MacKay Bridge in the community of Dartmouth. It straddles Highway 111, a CN Rail freight line, and Halifax Harbour. It is bordered on the south by Tuft's Cove. History Shannon Park, along with the adjacent former national defence site of Wallis Heights, housed the families of personnel serving with the Royal Canadian Navy. It was built in the 1950s to remedy the shortage of housing which plagued sailors and their families in Halifax during World War Two. The community was named after HMS Shannon, the Halifax-based frigate which won a notable victory in the War of 1812. With defence cutbacks reducing the number of personnel serving in the navy and expanded housing available on the civilian market, Shannon Park and Wallis Heights were closed in 2004 and remaining residents were moved to military housing at Willow Park. The buildings have fallen into decay.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2010/11/02/ns-shannon- park-land-value.html Immediately north of the neighbourhood on the Bedford basin adjacent to the MacKay bridge lies the Bedford Institute of Oceanography, a Canadian Coast Guard communication centre, and a Canadian Food Inspection Agency laboratory. Until the HRM withdrew its bid for the 2014 Commonwealth Games, urban planners envisioned Shannon Park to be used for locating the proposed sports stadium, athletes' village and several additional venues. Disposal of the land is being negotiated between National Defence and the Canada Lands Company crown corporation. Mi'kmaq from the Millbrook Reserve near Truro have applied for a portion of the land. Shannon Park now has a French immersion school. Although unused, Shannon Park remains part of CFB Halifax. The Department of National Defence disposed of Shannon Park in three pieces.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/shannon-park-in-dartmouth- split-3-ways-by-dnd-1.2626083 Present The Canada Lands Company bought 33 hectares, , including buildings and land on the site for redevelopment. The original Department of National Defence site was 39 hectares, . Another hectares was transferred to Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada. The Millbrook band has an outstanding land claim on a portion known as Turtle Cove, which it says was the site of a former Mi'kmaq settlement. The Canada Lands Company also bought an elementary school and 1.89 hectares of land for $313,000. Over the next year, it will try to negotiate a sale to the Halifax Regional School Board, which wants to acquire the school.

The genus contains many species formerly classified under the genus Eumeces, except those now placed in Mesoscincus. They are secretive, agile animals with a cylindrical body covered with smooth, shiny scales. They are distributed from East Asia to throughout North America from southern Canada south to Mexico, including oceanic islands such as Bermuda. Defensive mechanism The conspicuous coloring of species of Plestiodon is a survival trait: it attracts a predator's attention to the tail of the animal, which will break off when grabbed. A skink thus often manages to escape and hide under some rock, log, or fallen leaves while the predator still contemplates the wildly thrashing severed tail. (This is an instance of what is called autotomy: voluntarily shedding a body part in order to escape, and later re generating the body part.) After the tail regenerates, it usually has the same color as the rest of the body and is typically shorter than the original tail. In some species, regrown tails are pinkish. A regrown tail has a cartilaginous rod for support instead of vertebrae. Reproduction Plestiodon are all oviparous. The female lays eggs once a year after the breeding season in spring. The clutch size varies and is typically around 5 to 10 eggs. The hatchlings appear in late summer. Thermoregulation Like other reptiles, Plestiodon skinks are \\"cold-blooded\\" -- they are ectothermic animals: their metabolism cannot regulate their body temperature. To warm up, they often bask in the sun. In colder climates, they hibernate in winter in burrows below the frost line. In hot climates, they are active mainly in the morning and evening, staying under cover during the hottest hours of the day to avoid overheating. Systematics Recently two taxonomic revisions have been made regarding the 19th century genus Eumeces. They both resulted in similar results; the genus is paraphyletic and must be \\"sliced up\\" into several different genera. Griffith et al. (2000) proposed that the type species for Eumeces, E. pavimentatus, which is considered by many to be a subspecies of Eumeces schneiderii, should be changed to Lacerta fasciata, so that the genus name Eumeces would stay with the most species-rich clade. However this petition has not been verified by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. Schmitz et al. argued that Griffith et al. violated the Code and rejected the proposal on good grounds. Thus only the African species of the Eumeces schneiderii group still belong to the genus Eumeces.

It was first recorded during James Cook's second voyage around the world (1772‚Äì1775), on which it was illustrated by Georg Forster and described by Johann Reinhold Forster. No specimens have been preserved. As well as the documentation by the Forsters, there have been claims that the bird also existed on the nearby island of Mehetia. The Tahiti rail appears to have been closely related to, and perhaps derived from, the buff-banded rail, and has also been historically confused with the Tongan subspecies of that bird. The Tahiti rail was long, and its colouration was unusual for a rail. The underparts, throat, and eyebrow-like supercilium were white, and the upper parts were black with white dots and bands. The nape (or hind neck) was ferruginous (rust-coloured), the breast was grey, and it had a black band across the lower throat. The bill and iris were red, and the legs were fleshy pink. The Tahiti rail was supposedly flightless and nested on the ground. It is said to have been seen in open areas, marshes, and in coconut plantations. Its diet appears to have consisted mainly of insects and occasionally copra (coconut meat). The extinction of the Tahiti rail was probably due to predation by humans and introduced cats and rats. It appears to have become extinct some time after 1844 on Tahiti, and perhaps as late as the 1930s on Mehetia.  Taxonomy  James Cook's ships off Tahiti during his second voyage when this rail was found, William Hodges, 1776 The Tahiti rail was found on the South Pacific island of Tahiti (part of the Society Islands archipelago) by naturalists who were part of the British explorer James Cook's second voyage around the world (1772‚Äì1775). The bird was illustrated by Georg Forster, who accompanied his father, the German naturalist Johann Reinhold Forster. The father and son were tasked with recording natural history during the voyage, with Georg as the draughtsman. The plate (no. 128) is life-sized and is kept at the Natural History Museum in London. It is inscribed with the words \\"Rallus pacificus. Taheitee. Oomnaoe. Oomeea keto ≈çw'\\". No specimens of this bird have been preserved, but it is presumed that Forster saw a skin. The English naturalist John Latham referred to this species as the \\"Pacific Rail\\" in 1785, and the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin formally named the bird Rallus pacificus in 1789, based on Latham's account.Gmelin, J. F. (1789): Systema Naturae (13th edition) 1, part 2: p. 717. In 1844 the German naturalist Hinrich Lichtenstein published J.R. Forster's account of the discoveries made during the journey, including his description of the Tahiti rail. J.R. Forster indicated that the Tahiti rail was called Oomnaa or Eboon√†a on Tahiti and neighbouring islands, and Oom√®ia-Kete√≤w on Tonga, though he specified only Tahiti and nearby islands as being part of its range. Tevea also appears to have been one of the common names for the bird. In 1967 the American ornithologist James Greenway wrote that the bird was said by Polynesians to have also existed on the island of Mehetia near Tahiti \\"a generation ago\\", as reported to Greenway by the amateur naturalist Anthony Curtiss. Greenway also suggested it may have occurred on other islands. In 1972 the ornithologist Phillip L. Bruner stated the bird was last recorded on Mehetia about fifty years earlier. In 2012 the English ornithologist and artist Julian P. Hume referred to the claim that the bird lived on Mehetia as \\"hearsay\\" but regarded it as a possibility that it lived there and on other outlying islands. In 2001 the English writer Errol Fuller stated that unlike some other \\"hypothetical extinct species\\" only known from old accounts, the Tahiti rail was sufficiently well documented for there to be no doubt that it existed. The Tahiti rail has historically been confused with the extant Tongan subspecies of the buff-banded rail, Hypotaenidia philippensis ecaudata, which was also illustrated and described by the Forsters. In his 1783 description of the Tongan bird (wherein it was named Rallus eucaudata), the English ornithologist John Frederick Miller erroneously gave its locality as Tahiti, which led the Tahiti rail to be regarded as a junior synonym of the extant bird. He based his description on Forster's illustration (plate no.127) of the Tongan bird, and Latham and Gmelin later repeated Miller's erroneous locality. The 1844 publication of Forster's description listed the Tongan bird as a variety of the Tahitian species, and similar schemes were suggested by later writers until 1953, when the New Zealand biologist Averil Margaret Lysaght pointed out Miller's locality mistake, which had been overlooked until that point, and kept the two birds separate. In spite of the clarification, the Tongan bird was placed on a list of extinct birds in the 1981 book Endangered Birds of the World, and Forster's plate of the Tahiti rail was used to illustrate the Samoan wood rail (Gallinula pacifica), a completely different species, in the 1989 book Le Grand Livre des Esp√©cies Disparues. Along with the buff-banded rail and close relatives, the Tahiti rail has historically been placed in either the genus Hypotaenidia (as H. pacifica) or Gallirallus (as G. pacificus), and is currently classified in the former. The specific name refers to the Pacific Ocean and is Latin for \\"peaceful\\". In 1977 the American ornithologist Sidney Dillon Ripley suggested that the Tahiti rail was an isolated form of buff-banded rail and perhaps belonged to a superspecies with that bird and the Wake Island rail (Hypotaenidia wakensis). Rails are some of the most widespread terrestrial vertebrates, and have colonised practically all island groups, with many island species being flightless. In 1973 the American ornithologist Storrs L. Olson argued that many insular flightless species of rails were descended from still extant flighted rails, that flightlessness had evolved independently and rapidly in many different island species, and that this feature is therefore of no taxonomic importance. Flightlessness can be advantageous (especially where food is scarce) because it conserves energy by decreasing the mass of flight muscles; the absence of predators (particularly mammalian) and a reduced need for dispersal are factors that allow this feature to develop in island birds.  Description  1907 illustration by John Gerrard Keulemans, based on Forster's plate; the legs are depicted too brightly red. J.R. Forster stated the Tahiti rail was long, which is small for a member of its genus. Its colouration was also striking and unusual for a rail and it was described as being an attractive bird. The upper parts were black with white dots and bands (also referred to as spots and bars), and the underparts, throat, and eyebrow-like supercilium were white. The nape (or hind neck) was ferruginous (rust-coloured), the breast was grey, and it had a black band across the lower throat. The bill and iris were red, and the legs were fleshy pink. The sexes were presumably similar, and the immature and juvenile were not described. Forster's original description of the bird follows below, in a translation from Latin published by the English naturalist Walter Rothschild in 1907: The Tongan subspecies of the buff-banded rail, which has been confused with the Tahiti rail Forster also stated that the total length to the middle toe was long, the bill was long, the tibiae (shinbones) long, and the middle toe long. The Tahiti rail was similar to the buff-banded rail in the pattern of the nape and supercilium, and its spots and bars, but was otherwise generally distinct from other members of its genus. Forster's plate (which Fuller described as \\"rather crude\\" yet \\"explicit\\") became the basis for other depictions of the bird, by artists such as John Gerrard Keulemans (1907), Fenwick Lansdowne (1977), and Hume (2012). Keulemans' illustration was made for the 1907 book Extinct Birds (before Forster's original had been published) by Rothschild, who pointed out that the legs had been painted too brightly red in the new adaptation, when they should instead have been flesh-coloured. Keulemans also depicted bars on the tail covert feathers not shown in the original, according to Ripley.  Behaviour and ecology  The Tahiti rail was supposedly flightless, and nested on the ground. Its social behaviour is unknown. Bruner claimed to have gained information about the behaviour of the species from \\"the few people who still remember the bird\\". According to Bruner, the call of the bird was described as similar to that of other rails, though it differed in ending in a high-pitched whistle. It was said to have been seen in open areas, sometimes with other rails in marshes, and in coconut plantations. Its diet appears to have consisted mainly of insects found in grass, and it occasionally fed on copra (coconut meat). Its broken colour pattern was said to make it blend well with its surroundings, and it lacked \\"shyness\\".  Extinction  The extinction of the Tahiti rail was probably due to predation by humans and introduced cats and rats. The small, outlying islands off Tahiti also have rats, though there were no cats on Mehetia at the time of Greenway's writing in 1967. According to Bruner, the bird was said to have been common on Tahiti until the end of the 19th century, beginning to decline thereafter; it had disappeared from there after 1844. It may have survived on the smaller, uninhabited island of Mehetia until the 1930s, perhaps due to the absence of cats. This later date is accepted by the IUCN Red List. Other extinct Tahitian birds include the Tahiti sandpiper and the black-fronted parakeet, and some species have disappeared from Tahiti itself but survive on other islands. According to Olson, it is possible that hundreds of rail populations have become extinct from islands following the arrival of humans within the past 1500 years.

The western terminus of the route is at an intersection with NY 5 in the town of St. Johnsville. Its eastern terminus is at the Vermont state line in Hoosick, where it continues eastward as Vermont Route 67 (VT 67). Route description =Montgomery and Fulton counties= NY 67 begins at an intersection with NY 5 east of the village of St. Johnsville in the town of the same name. It heads eastward across northern Montgomery County as New Turnpike Road to the Fulton County line, where maintenance of NY 67 shifted from the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to the town of Ephratah until 2012. Thus, the segment of New Turnpike Road between the county line and NY 10 has no reference markers. This segment of the route also lacks any shoulders. At NY 10, maintenance of NY 67 returns to NYSDOT as it turns north to overlap NY 10 into the hamlet of Ephratah. In Ephratah, NY 67 splits from NY 10 and heads east as a narrow and winding highway. It continues into the town of Johnstown, where it meets the eastern terminus of the aforementioned New Turnpike Road (an unimproved town road) at Eppie Corners and winds through hilly terrain through the hamlet of Keck's Center. It intersects the north end of NY 334 before passing into the city of Johnstown. In the western part of the city, NY 67 follows West Main Street for several blocks to William Street, where it is joined by NY 29\\\\. After crossing downtown, the overlap with NY 29 ends with NY 29 continuing straight (east) on East Main Street and NY 67 veering southeast onto East State Street. The route exits the city just southeast of a junction with NY 30A. NY 67 proceeds onward, passing the Fulton County Airport, Hamilton-Fulton-Montgomery BOCES, and Fulton-Montgomery Community College before reentering Montgomery County. =Second pass through Montgomery County= Once again in Montgomery County, NY 67 follows a winding, narrow path. One steep curve was eliminated in the early 2000s northwest of Fort Johnson. In Fort Johnson, NY 67 joins NY 5 toward Amsterdam. In Amsterdam, NY 67 enters with NY 5 as West Main Street. After passing an unusual flashing traffic light at Guy Park Manor, a four-lane highway begins parallel to Main Street. Historically, NY 5 and NY 67 followed Main Street through the city. With the 1977 creation of the Amsterdam Mall, NY 5 and NY 67, together with NY 30, were re-routed onto splits comprising the Amsterdam Arterial. After a left exit for NY 30 southbound and a link to the Thruway, NY 67 follows underneath NY 30 southbound, then takes a left exit next to the mall. NY 67 then follows NY 30 North, crossing NY 5 westbound, then splitting off toward Ballston Spa, passing through the hamlet of Manny Corners, south of the village of Hagaman. =Saratoga County= NY 67 at I-87 NY 67 enjoys a wider route, enabling faster driving and more gentle curves, passing south of the village of Galway. In Ballston Spa, NY 67 meets NY 50, turning south and overlapping for about a mile. NY 67 then splits off to the east, heading toward the Adirondack Northway at Malta. In the Malta Area, NY 67 enters as Dunning Street. Immediately before Interstate 87 (I-87), there is a roundabout at State Farm Road. A second roundabout shortly thereafter handles the southbound ramp traffic of I-87 exit 12, with a third roundabout handing northbound on the other side. A fourth roundabout handles an intersection with Malta Commons and Kelch Drive, and a fifth handles the intersection with U.S. Route 9 (US 9), beginning the overlap with US 9\\\\. A house straddling the New York-Vermont state line located on NY-VT 67\\\\. After the final roundabout, NY 67 turns south, concurrent with US 9 for , just north of the village of Round Lake. Here, the route heads eastward, taking a winding path toward Mechanicville and the Hudson River. After entering the city, NY 67 becomes concurrent with US 4 and NY 32 for less than , then heads east toward Schaghticoke, crossing the Hudson on the Mechanicville Bridge. =Rensselaer and Washington counties= Old Schaghticoke Road carries NY 67 eastward and uphill, meeting NY 40 as Reservoir Road. Turning left and overlapping, the routes enter Schaghticoke upon crossing the Hoosic River. Passing through the village, NY 67 splits right at the Schaghticoke Fairgrounds, where County Route 125 (CR 125), an old routing of NY 67, enters from the left. NY 67 turns to cross the Hoosic River again in Valley Falls, running south of the river through Buskirk and crossing again in Eagle Bridge to briefly enter Washington County. NY 67 meets NY 22 in White Creek after . Turning right, running concurrent for , the paired routes re-enter Rensselaer County. Once back in Rensselaer County, the routes split at North Hoosick. Passing through farmland, NY 67 ends at the Vermont state line, continuing as VT 67\\\\. History The portion of modern NY 67 between what is now NY 147 south of Galway and the southern end of the overlap with NY 50 south of Ballston Spa was originally designated as part of two legislative routes by the New York State Legislature in 1908. From Galway to Ballston Spa, what is now NY 67 was part of Route 37\\\\. The modern overlap with NY 50 was part of Route 25. In 1912, Route 37 was realigned between Kimball Corners and Saratoga Springs to use modern NY 29\\\\. Its former routing between Kimball Corners and Ballston Spa via Galway was redesignated as Route 37-a. Also added in 1912 was Route 37-b, a spur route that ran from Route 25 south of Ballston Spa east to what is now US 9 in Malta via current NY 67. The Route 37-a and Route 37-b designations were eliminated on March 1, 1921. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, the section of modern NY 67 between Round Lake and Mechanicville was designated as part of NY 6. Most of NY 6, including the section from Round Lake to Malta, was renumbered to US 9 in 1927. This edition shows U.S. Routes as they were first officially signed in 1927. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, US 9 was realigned onto its modern alignment between Albany and Round Lake. Its former routing from Round Lake to Malta became part of the new NY 67, which extended west to NY 10 in Ephratah and east to the Vermont state line via Johnstown, Amsterdam, Ballston Spa, Stillwater, and Hoosick. From Galway to Malta, NY 67 utilized the former alignments of legislative Routes 25, 37-a and 37-b. Between Mechanicville and Schaghticoke, NY 67 initially ran concurrent with US 4 and NY 32 to Stillwater, where it turned east and followed what is now CR 125 across the Hudson River (via Stillwater Bridge) to NY 40 north of Schaghticoke in Rensselaer County. On April 1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of NY 67 between the access road to lock 4 of the Champlain Canal and NY 40 was transferred from the state of New York to Rensselaer County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. One highway transferred from the county to the state at this time was Old Schaghticoke Road, which extended from the county line at Mechanicville east to NY 40 just southwest of Schaghticoke. NY 67 was realigned to follow the new state highway between Mechanicville and Schaghticoke while the county-maintained portion of its former alignment became CR 125\\\\. The short piece of NY 67's former routing between US 4 and NY 32 in Stillwater and the access road to Champlain Canal lock 4 remained state-maintained and became NY 915C, an unsigned reference route. A second maintenance swap, this time between the state and Montgomery County, occurred on April 1, 1981. As part of the swap, ownership and maintenance of New Turnpike Road (CR 52) between NY 5 outside of St. Johnsville and the Fulton County line was transferred from Montgomery County to the state of New York. The new state highway became a westward extension of NY 67, which overlapped a section of NY 10 between Ephratah and NY 10's junction with New Turnpike Road. The section of New Turnpike Road between the Fulton County line and NY 10 was not transferred to the state and is still maintained by the town of Ephratah for several years. It was eventually transferred to NYSDOT in 2012 Major intersections See also *List of county routes in Rensselaer County, New York References External links 067 Transportation in Rensselaer County, New York Transportation in Montgomery County, New York Transportation in Fulton County, New York Transportation in Saratoga County, New York Transportation in Washington County, New York ","title":"New York State Route 67"},{"id":"5753532","text":"Spieden Island, 1989.Spieden Island is a privately owned island in the San Juan Archipelago in the U.S. state of Washington. It has a land area of and no permanent resident population as of the 2000 census, although several structures are present on various parts of the island. The island was purchased by James Jannard, founder and major shareholder of Oakley, Inc. in 1997 through a shell company and is still owned by him as of 2019.  Geography  Approximately two miles long and 1/2 mile across at its widest point, it is less than a mile north of San Juan Island, across the Spieden Channel. The highest point of the island is approximately 374 feet above sea level. The north side is heavily forested but the south side is largely barren. The south side features many (glacial erratics), large boulders deposited by glacial activity in the past.  History  Spieden Island was named by Charles Wilkes during the Wilkes Expedition of 1838‚Äì1842, to honor William Speiden, the purser of the expedition's Peacock. In the 1970s and 1980s the island was used for big game hunting; non-native game animals such as Mouflon sheep from Corsica, fallow deer from Europe, and Sika deer from Asia ‚Äì along with approximately 2,000 exotic birds such as african guinea fowl ‚Äì were brought to the island. A hunting lodge, airstrip, and small hangar were built to accommodate visitors. The venture was short-lived, however, partially due to environmental concerns and also due to the risk of errant shots reaching nearby San Juan Island, which is relatively populated. The imported species continue to survive on the island. The Island Institute, an environmental education camp run by Jane Howard, was once located on the island. It is no longer in operation.

Marysville Bridge The Dauphin (or Marysville) railroad bridge in 1872 As the Northern Central Railway built north up the Susquehanna River from Baltimore, Maryland to the coal regions, it had to cross from the west to the east bank of the Susquehanna. The chosen crossing site was at the Dauphin Narrows, between Marysville on the west and Dauphin on the east. The bridge was finished in 1858, allowing the Northern Central to haul coal from Sunbury, Pennsylvania to Baltimore. However, the construction of a line from Dauphin to Rockville and the takeover of the Northern Central by the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1875 resulted in most Northern Central traffic being rerouted over the PRR's Rockville Bridge a short distance downstream. The Marysville Bridge was allowed to fall into decay, and removed in 1902 or 1903 after a period of disuse. Some of the piers remain above water today, while others are submerged or washed away.

As Uganda's independence approached in 1962, Astles became involved with a number of political groups. One of these was led by Milton Obote, who led the country to independence. = Idi Amin = Astles worked in Obote's government until the 1971 coup d'√©tat, when he transferred his allegiance to Amin. In December, suspicion fell on Astles because of his previous support for Obote. Amin sent him to Makindye Prison where he spent 17 weeks, often shackled and brutally interrogated. Astles later said, \\"Amin called me a 'rotten apple' on the radio, and nationalised my airline. It was ordinary Africans who helped me to survive. One guard was kicked to death for helping me.\\" In 1975, Astles joined Amin's service, becoming the head of the anti-corruption squad and advising the president on British affairs, while running a pineapple farm. He also presided over an aviation service that transported members of the government. Astles later said \\"I kept my eyes shut, I said nothing about what I saw, which is what they liked\\". What Astles did or did not do during Amin's reign is a matter of conjecture. Some considered him to be a malign influence on the dictator; others thought he was a moderating presence. That was Astles's own claim. In an interview inside a Ugandan prison, with the journalist Paul Vallely who had secured it after smuggling a message inside a Bible to Amin's former right-hand man, he claimed: \\"I was the only person he could trust because I never asked him for anything ‚Äì no fine house, no privileges, no Mercedes-Benz. I was the only one, perhaps because I was white, who he could be sure was not after his job and his life. If Idi Amin ever had a sincere friend, it was Bob Astles. I was the only person who could cope with him. The other members of his Government would phone me and say: ‚ÄòCan you come quickly, he is out of control.‚Äô I would go and let him shout and rail at me and then I would try to calm him down. I was one of the few people he trusted.\\", interview in The Times, 10 December 1985. Astles came to be known as \\"Major\\" Bob (the title of Major was given to him by Amin) or \\"the White Rat\\" among other white Ugandans. Imprisonment Following the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War, Astles fled Uganda by crossing Lake Victoria in a canoe to Kenya on 10 April 1979. The following day, Amin fled to Libya, the capital Kampala was captured by the combined forces of the Tanzanian Army and the Uganda National Liberation Army, and Amin's rule over Uganda ended. In Kisumu, Astles surrendered to Kenyan authorities, who then detained him.\\"Former white aide to Amin brought back to Uganda\\". Afro-American (Baltimore, Maryland, USA). June 16, 1979. p. 16. While detained in Kenya, Astles tried to jump from a third- story window in a suicide attempt in Nairobi.\\"Suicide Attempt\\". The Globe and Mail (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). June 12, 1979. p. B1. Kenyan authorities handed him over to Ugandan police in accordance with their request on 9 June. Astles was brought back to Uganda to face criminal charges.\\"Uganda Asks Kenya To Extradite Astles, Top Aide to Amin\\". The Washington Post. April 26, 1979. p. A27. At the time Kenyan newspapers linked the charges to the death of Bruce McKenzie, one of Kenya's former ministers, in an aircraft explosion. Nevertheless, it was suspected that the bomb was actually meant for Astles, who had refused to fly on the aircraft.New Scientist 10 May 1979 Astles was imprisoned for his alleged association with Amin's security apparatus. Astles was charged with murder, armed robbery, theft, shopbreaking, and stealing from a private house. Astles pleaded not guilty to all charges.\\"New Uganda charges\\". The Sun (Baltimore, Maryland, USA). July 10, 1979. p. A4. Astles said he had never committed any murders, never witnessed any murders, never heard Amin order any murders, and never saw Amin murder anyone. Astles said he had lived in constant fear while in Amin's administration, and that he had remained in his position because he thought he could do some good for Uganda. Astles was acquitted of the charges, but he remained in Luzira Prison for another four years under a detention order because he was considered a threat to state security.\\"Uganda frees top Amin aide\\".

He also contributed political commentaries to a number of publications associated with Africa. Death Astles died in South West London on 29 December 2012 at the age of 88. The obituary in The Telegraph described him as \\"the most hated white man in postcolonial Africa.\\" Film Bob Astles was played by Leonard Trolley in the 1982 film Amin: the Rise and Fall. The fictional character of Nicholas Garrigan in the book and film The Last King of Scotland was, according to author Giles Foden, loosely based on some events in Astles' life. Foden interviewed Astles while writing his novel.

Career Fedderson was born April 16, 1913, in Beresford, South Dakota. His family moved to Kansas, where he worked on the business and advertising staffs of The Wichita Eagle and Wichita Beacon newspapers. In 1942 he became an account executive of the San Francisco News and then sales manager of San Francisco radio station KYA, rising to president and general manager and collecting a Peabody Award for a program he developed. Los Angeles radio station KTMR was added to his charge when the New York Post bought it and KYA. KTMR became KLAC and added a television broadcast in 1948. Fedderson was in charge of radio and TV broadcasts for five years. Fedderson formed his own television company in 1953 and signed Liberace to a contract that put him before a nationwide TV audience. It was one of several shows starring the flamboyant pianist on network and syndicated television. Fedderson also produced the syndicated series ‚Ä≥Life With Elizabeth‚Ä≥ starring Betty White in 1953-54, ‚Ä≥The Millionaire‚Ä≥ with Marvin Miller on CBS from 1955-60, and ‚Ä≥Date with the Angels,‚Ä≥ again with Miss White, on ABC in 1957-58. Fedderson‚Äôs company became TV consultants to bandleader Lawrence Welk in 1954 and put him on ABC from 1955-71, then syndicated his program widely until 1982. Fedderson produced ‚Ä≥The Smith Family,‚Ä≥ an ABC series starring Henry Fonda as a detective from 1971-72; ‚Ä≥To Rome With Love,‚Ä≥ with John Forsythe, on CBS from 1969-71; and ‚Ä≥Family Affair,‚Ä≥ starring Brian Keith as a substitute father for a nephew and two nieces, and Sebastian Cabot as his servant, which ran on CBS from 1966-71. Fedderson also delved successfully into game shows. He produced ‚Ä≥Do You Trust Your Wife‚Ä≥ with Edgar Bergen as host of the primetime quiz show on CBS from 1956 to 1957. It then switched to ABC as a daytime show called ‚Ä≥Who Do You Trust?‚Ä≥ starring Johnny Carson, who was joined in 1958 by sidekick Ed McMahon. The future ‚Ä≥Tonight Show‚Ä≥ duo left in 1962, and the show, which by then sported a ‚Ä≥Whom‚Ä≥ instead of a ‚Ä≥Who‚Ä≥ in its title, ran through 1963 with host Woody Woodbury. Fedderson's biggest success on television, however, began in 1960 with My Three Sons, starring Fred MacMurray, of which Fedderson served as the executive producer. The show aired for five years on ABC and another seven on CBS, producing a total of 380 episodes, making it the fourth longest- running live-action sitcom amongst American prime-time network programs. On November 14, 1974, Fedderson received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contribution to the television industry, at 1735 N. Vine Street. Personal life Fedderson was married to actress Helen Macie \\"Tido\\" Minor from 1938 to 1968. He fathered seven children, two of whom became actors: Gregg Fedderson and Mike Minor. In 1969, he married actress Yvonne Lime, the co-founder of Childhelp. They remained married until his death. Death Fedderson died on December 18, 1994, at the age of 81, from heart disease while being treated at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, California.

He was a son of Emperor Alexios IV of Trebizond and Theodora Kantakouzene.  Early life  John had been designated despotes, or heir apparent, by his father as early as 1417, but had come into conflict with his parents. According to a passage considered to be an interpolation in the history of Laonikos Chalkokondyles, he accused his mother Theodora of having an affair with an unnamed protovestiarios, whom he killed, then held his parents captive in the citadel until the palace staff released them. John then fled to Georgia.Chalkokondyles, Histories II.219.12-222.21; discussed in Anthony Kaldellis, \\"The Interpretations in the Histories of Laonikos Chalkokondyles\\", Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies, 52 (2012), pp. 260-262 As a result, his brother Alexander was designated despotes in his place. While in Georgia John married Bagrationi, a daughter of King Alexander I, but he could not obtain sufficient support to establish himself in Trebizond. A Genoese document dated November 8, 1427 orders the consul at Caffa in the Crimea to keep on good terms with the Emperor of Trebizond for news of John arriving at Caffa had reached Genoa.William Miller, Trebizond: The last Greek Empire of the Byzantine Era: 1204-1461, 1926 (Chicago: Argonaut, 1969), p. 82 Here he found a large vessel full of arms, and in exchange for appointing its owner his protostrator the vessel and its crew brought him home in 1429.Chalkokondyles II.219-220; translated by Anthony Kaldellis, The Histories (Cambridge: Dumbarton Oaks Medieval Library, 2014), vol. 2 pp. 307 Landing at Saint Phokas (the modern Kordyle), John and his supporters made their base in the monastery. His father Alexios rode out with his retinue and camped nearby. An important family, the Kabasitai, offered to act as intermediaries; however, an interpolator of the History of Chalkokondyles, or Pseudo-Chalkokondyles,For a discussion of this source, see Kaldellis, \\"The Interpolations\\", pp. 259‚Äì283 states that they were John's \\"secret accomplices\\" for some of the Kabasitai had agreed to allow two of John's archontes into Emperor Alexios' tent, and once inside the archontes murdered Alexios around midnight. According to Pseudo-Chalkokondyles, John had instructed them to only bring his father to him, but the men thought John would be more grateful if they killed his father the Emperor, and did so. They learned they had misunderstood John's wishes: he had the eyes of one man put out and the hand of the other cut off.Chalkokondyles II.220; translated by Kaldellis, The Histories, vol. 2 pp. 308f Pero Tafur provides a detail at variance with the account of Pseudo-Chalkokondyles, for he reports that John became emperor with help of the Turkish Sultan.A. Vasiliev, \\"Tero Tafur, a Spanish Traveler of the XVth Century and His Visit to Constantinople, Trebizond, and Italy,\\" Byzantion, 7 (1932), p. 98 It may be both versions contain part of the truth: although John ascended to the throne on the murder of his father, it may be the Turkish Sultan provided John with financial or military support to return to Trebizond. John was recognized as emperor in Trebizond some time before 28 October 1429, the date of the first document that mentions him on the throne.Miller, Trebizond, p. 83 His brother Alexander was afterwards exiled to Constantinople, where the Spanish Ambassador Tafur met him eight years later.  Reign  John IV began his reign by punishing the physical murderers of his father, then burying his father in state in the metropolitan cathedral. His reign was dominated by ongoing attempts to defend Trebizond from its Turkmen neighbors and the increasingly aggressive Ottoman Empire to the west. In 1442 the Ottoman Sultan Murad II sent out a fleet to plunder the shores and to attempt to capture the city. This expedition did not seriously affect Trebizond itself, but attacked Trebizond's dependencies in the Crimea and was partly destroyed by a storm on its return journey. The Ottomans did not make another attack on the Empire of Trebizond until the reign of the next Sultan, Mehmed II.Miller, Trebizond, p. 85 In February 1451 the Byzantine diplomat George Sphrantzes arrived in Trebizond seeking a bride for his emperor, Constantine XI Palaiologos. This incident is notable for the anecdote it relates about John, who gleefully related to Sphrantzes the news of the death of Sultan Murad II, and that Mehmed II's youth meant that now his empire could last longer and be blessed. Sphrantzes, however, was taken aback and explained to him that Mehmed's youth and seeming friendship were only ploys, and that under John's brother-in-law John VIII the empire had been deeply in debt, but now his new emperor was trying to change that.Sphranzes, ch. 30. translated in Marios Philippides, The Fall of the Byzantine Empire: A Chronicle by George Sphrantzes, 1401-1477 (Amherst: University of Massachusetts, 1980), pp. 58ff His conversation with Sphrantzes should have warned John IV the new peril which had come forth. After the Fall of Constantinople to Mehmed II in 1453, Trebizond and the Morea were left as the last remnants of the Byzantine imperial tradition. Mehmed II immediately summoned John to pay tribute in Constantinople and imposed heavy tolls on Trapezuntine and Venetian shipping through the straits. John apparently failed to cooperate, and in 1456 the Sultan dispatched his governor of Amasya Hizir Bey to attack Trebizond by both land and sea.Miller, Trebizond, pp. 85-87 According to Chalkokondyles, Hizir raided the countryside, even penetrating into the marketplace of Trebizond, capturing altogether about two thousand people. The city was deserted due to plague and likely to fall; John made his submission and agreed to pay an annual tribute of 2,000 gold pieces in return for the return the captives Hizir had taken. John sent his brother David to ratify the treaty before Mehmed II himself, which he did in 1458, but the tribute was raised to 3,000 gold pieces.Chalkokondyles II.222; translated by Kaldellis, The Histories, vol. 2 p. 313. Miller, Trebizond, p. 87 Aware of the Ottoman advance against the remaining Byzantine possessions in the Morea, John IV attempted to bolster his position by resorting to an old family tradition; the same year David delivered the tribute to Mehmed, John married his daughter Theodora to Uzun Hasan of the Ak Koyunlu.Franz Babinger, Mehmed the Conqueror and his Time, translated by Ralph Manheim (Princeton: University Press, 1978), p. 185 He also pursued Western support through effecting a union with the Roman Catholic Church. As early as 1434 he had responded to the letters of Pope Eugenius IV, in marked contrast to earlier emperors of Trebizond, who had ignored papal missives. The Metropolitan of Trebizond joined the Byzantine clergy at the Council of Basel-Ferrara-Florence (1438-1439).Miller, Trebizond, pp. 89-91 However, these approaches to the Papacy were not marked by harmonious relations with the most important Western power concerned with Trebizond, the Republic of Genoa. Although John owed his throne to a Genoese crew, he repeatedly failed to reimburse the Genoese for debts owed to them in 1431, and in 1441 refused to provide reparations for a Genoese ship ordered seized and looted six years earlier. Further diplomatic initiatives by Genoa failed in 1443, and in 1447 the Genoese of Caffa advanced on Trebizond with their fleet, threatening to set up an embargo. The disputes were never fully settled and seriously injured commerce in the Black Sea.Miller, Trebizond, pp. 91ff John's hostile attitude towards Genoa was explained by one contemporary, the Spanish traveller Pero Tafur, as a fear of a potential Byzantine-Genoese alliance that could place his brother Alexander on the throne of Trebizond. Alexander had fled Trebizond for the Byzantine court in 1429 and had eventually married Maria Gattilusio, the daughter of the Genoese lord of Lesbos. The apprehensiveness towards Genoa was contrasted by friendlier relations with Venice, although the Venetians never recovered their former influence in the Black Sea.Miller, Trebizond, pp. 83f At some point in his reign, John was faced with an attack by the ruler of Ardabil, Shaykh Junayd, who marched upon Trebziond: proposed dates range from the 1430s (E. Janssens) through the 1440s (von Hammer, Finlay, and Miller) to 1456 (Shukurov) or 1456-58 (Bryer).Discussed in Rustam Shukurov, \\"The campaign of Shaykh Djunayd Safawi against Trebizond (1456 AD/860 AH)\\", Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies, 17 (1993), pp. 127-140 John assembled his land and naval forces, then assisted by his pansebastos sailed forth to meet the Shaikh. The two armies met at Kapanion. John had planned to attack Junayd from both land and sea; however, a strong wind prevented the sailors from landing and the Sheikh's men successfully counteracted, killing the pansebastos and scattering the army. John escaped by means of his fleet, and made it back to Trebizond. Shaykh Junayd soon arrived before the walls of Trebizond, but after three days he found the walls impregnable and marched his army south to ravage the district of Mesochaldia instead.  Death  No contemporary chronicler or historian recorded the actual date of John's death.Unless otherwise indicated, this section is based on Beginning with Jakob Philipp Fallmerayer, modern scholars have inferred it from two records: one was a letter from John's successor and brother, David of Trebizond, dated 22 April 1459, but because it was associated with the dubious embassy led by Ludovico da Bologna, and internal inconsistencies, this letter has been considered at the least a partial forgery; the other record was a damaged inscription Fallmerayer reported to have seen in the citadel (\\"high tower\\"), which was made by John and dated to the year 6968 (= A.D. 1 September 1459 ‚Äì 31 August 1460); however this inscription was never seen by any other historian, despite determined efforts, and the citadel itself has since been destroyed. Since William Miller wrote his book on Trebizond, the scholarly consensus dated his death to 1458, although with some dissent to 1459 (Lampsides, Kursanskis) or simply state the broad limits 1458/9-1460 (Anthony Bryer). This may have been settled with the discovery of a memorandum in the Genoese archives. Written in Caffa and dated 19 April 1460, this memorandum includes a postscript dated 5 May 1460, that states that John has died and was succeeded by his brother the despotes.Imperator Trapezundarum diem suum obiit. In cuius imperio successit illustris dominus Dispotus eius frater, cum quo novo Imperatore studebimus pro posse vivere quiete. In discussing this document, Thierre Ganchou explains that it confirms clearly a terminus ante quem for John's death of 22 April 1460. Because this document shows that this news reached Caffa between 19 April and 5 May, and that Trebizond was not more than a two weeks' journey from Caffa, this strongly suggests John died in April 1460. Ganchou explains the discrepancies in the rest of the evidence facilely. The year \\"1459\\" in the letter carried by the embassy of Ludovico da Bologna was an error in transcription: the original letter has not been found, and may no longer exist. The first time this letter was printed was in 1496, taken from the text of Reg. Lat. 557, a manuscript now at the Vatican Library. Noting that the letter appears between two other documents dated to 1459, Ganchou blames a \\"lazy scribe\\" for writing that year when transcribing this letter, instead of the correct 1460. Once these two sources are accepted as plausible, then there is no longer any basis to reject the evidence of the lost inscription Fallmerayer reported seeing on the .  Marriage and children  John IV was married twice, first to an unnamed daughter of King Alexander I of Georgia,Cyril Toumanoff, \\"The Fifteenth-century Bagratids and the Institution of Collegial Sovereignty in Georgia\\", Traditio, 7 (1949-1951), pp. 182ff then prior to November 1437 he married the daughter of a Turkish sultan. According to the Europ√§ische Stammtafeln, his second wife was the daughter of Dawlat Berdi Khan of the Golden Horde, although no basis for this identification is given. An alternative identification is that she was the daughter of the Crimean Khan, Hacƒ± I Giray.Kelsey Jackson Williams, A Genealogy of the Grand Komnenoi of Trebizond', Foundations 2(3) (2006) p. 183 He is commonly said to have as many as three children‚Äîa son and either one or two daughters.For example, see George Finlay, The History of Greece and the Empire of Trebizond, (1204-1461) (Edinburgh: William Blackwood, 1877), p. 508 However, Kur≈°anskis has shown that John had only one child‚ÄîTheodora Megale Komnene, better known by her Mongol appellation \\"Despina Hatun\\".Michel Kur≈°anskis, \\"La descendance d'Alexis IV, empereur de Tr√©bizonde.

Gradually the number of these double-ended engines (known as Double Fairlies) grew to 10, and came to include the B class of 1874. There was still a need for orthodox engines with Fairlie manoeuvrability. The Avonside Engine Company of Bristol, England solved the problem by providing both the R and S classes of Single Fairlie engines; 18 of the former in 1878-79 and 7 of the latter in 1880-81.T. A. McGavin, Steam Locomotives of New Zealand, Part One: 1863 to 1900 (Wellington: New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society, 1987), 34-5. The R class locomotives were built at Avonside's Bristol factory and then shipped to New Zealand, with all entering service by early March 1880.New Zealand Railways Steam Locomotives, \\"R Class 0-6-4T Register\\", accessed 9 December 2007. The locomotives quickly earned a good reputation for speed and manoeuvrability. On a trial run, Charles Rous-Marten timed one as running from Upper Hutt to Wellington, a distance of 20 miles, in 32.5 minutes despite a number of short delays amounting to three minutes; one section of two miles was covered at a maximum speed of 53 miles per hour. They were allocated to depots across the country, and during their working life operated almost all types of services from premier passenger trains to shunting tasks. As built, they could carry 716 gallons of water, but to allow them to operate over extended distances, some were later fitted with 900 gallon side tanks. All were reboilered during their lives to raise the boiler pressure from 130 to 160 pounds per square inch. Accidents R 28 overhanging Lyttelton wharf on 23 March 1907. The locomotives were involved in a number of accidents. On 23 March 1907, R 28 was running the Boat Train to the wharf at Lyttelton to connect with the Wellington ferry when it ran the stop-block. The driving frame, wheels and engine took a dive into Lyttelton harbour, but because of the design, the rest of the locomotive remained on the wharf. Retirement The R class were gradually withdrawn from NZR service between 1919 and 1936. In July 1919, R 29 was sold to the Manawatu County Council and it worked on the Sanson Tramway through to its 1946 closure. Three more Rs went to the Manawatu County Council for use on the Sanson Tramway, two of which were given away free by NZR for use as spares. Another branch of government, the Public Works Department, acquired R 33 in August 1919. Five more were withdrawn in March 1922, and withdrawals continued throughout the 1920s, with only three surviving in NZR ownership into the 1930s. The last, R 271, was retired in March 1936 and dumped at Oamaru at the foreshore. A number, however, operated into the middle of the 20th century in private industrial use. Ironically due to its 1907 wharf accident, R 28 was sold to the Timaru Harbour Board in 1934. Until 1940, it was for shunting the Timaru wharves. It was later sold to Burkes Creek Colliery, Reefton for use on their mining railway. Laid up in 1948, R 28 was later placed in Reefton's town park for static preservation. In 2000 a working group took over care for the locomotive, where it will be moved into the restored Reefton engine shed for ultimate restoration to working order.

Career Fitzmaurice's career first started as a set designer on stage. Beginning in 1914 until his death in 1940, he directed over 80 films, including several successful movies such as The Son of the Sheik, Raffles, Mata Hari, and Suzy. At the beginning of his directorial career, Fitzmaurice was astute at directing stage actresses in their initial films with the first wave of great Broadway stars that migrated to motion pictures during the World War I era, including Mae Murray, Elsie Ferguson, Fannie Ward, Helene Chadwick, Irene Fenwick, Gail Kane, and Edna Goodrich. The Son of the Sheik is his most famous extant silent film, no doubt aided by the sudden death of its star, Rudolph Valentino. Lilac Time is a classic war/romance film. Fitzmaurice, however, directed scores of silent films of which the majority of them are lost to the ravages of decomposition. Recent discoveries in Gosfilmofond in Russia include 1919's Witness for the Defense with Elsie Ferguson and 1922's Kick In with Bert Lytell. A restoration of his 1928 part- talkie hybrid The Barker is winning praise from many film buffs. Rumors of other Fitzmaurice films in Gosfilmofond include 1920s Idols of Clay (with Mae Murray) and Three Live Ghosts with Norman Kerry, Anna Q. Nilsson, Cyril Chadwick, and Edmund Goulding. Personal life The Profiteers, 1919 The Emperor's Candesticks, 1937 He was married at one time to Ouida Bergere, later the wife of Basil Rathbone. His second wife was Diana Kane, a sister of actress Lois Wilson. With Kane, he had two daughters Sheila Fitzmaurice born in 1929, and Patricia Fitzmaurice Baxter born in 1931.

History and gameplay Raise the Roof was one of the first game shows to exploit the lifting of the Independent Television Commission's prize limits, by giving away a large, valuable house as the star prize. The format featured several rounds of questions which progressively whittled the contestant pool from six to one. The final round offered the house as the grand prize. Eliminated contestants kept whatever money they earned; in addition, the lowest-scoring player in each round also received \\"Bob's Bungalow\\" - a cottage-shaped teapot. =Format= Round 1: The Lucky Seven The six contestants answered seven true/false statements of increasing value: ¬£50, ¬£55, ¬£60, ¬£70, ¬£80, ¬£85, and ¬£100. A correct response added the value to the contestant's score, but a miss reset their score to zero. At the end of the round, the three highest- scoring contestants advanced to the second round. If there was a tie for low score, the contestant with the most correct answers advanced. If they were tied in this respect as well, one last true/false tiebreaker was asked and the contestant who responded correctly in the shortest time would advance. Contestants could win up to ¬£500 in this round. Contestants who tied for low score and were eliminated each received Bob's Bungalow. Round 2: Bid and Break The three remaining contestants were each given ¬£500 to wager on six toss-up questions, with a maximum wager of ¬£100 per question. The category for each question was announced before the contestants made their wagers. A correct buzz-in added the contestant's wager to their score and deducted the opponents' wagers from theirs. A miss penalized the contestant accordingly and gave the other two a chance to buzz-in and respond. At the end of the round, the contestant with the lowest total was eliminated; the other two advanced. If there was a tie for low score, a tiebreaker toss-up was asked to determine who advanced. Contestants could win up to ¬£1,100 in this round. Round 3 The two remaining contestants were each given ¬£1,000 to wager on five questions, with a maximum wager of ¬£200 per question, and entered separate isolation booths so that they could hear the host but not each other. As in round two, the category for each question was given before the contestants made their wagers. Each contestant gave an answer; a correct answer added the wager to the contestant's score, while a miss deducted it. The contestant with the higher total advanced to the final. If the round ended in a tie, a final question was asked. Contestants could win up to ¬£2,000 in this round, for a potential maximum of ¬£3,600 over the entire game. Endgame The contestant chose five categories from a board of 54, each of which contained one question, and had 60 seconds to answer the questions in any order. The clock began to run only after the contestant selected one of the five categories and Holness finished reading its question, and stopped only when the contestant either answered or passed. An incorrect answer put the question out of play, but the contestant could return to passed questions later if time allowed. Four correct answers were needed to win the house; if the contestant ran out of time or missed two questions, they won a consolation prize and Bob's Bungalow instead. =Ratings= The programme made little impact with the public and was not recommissioned after one series of 17 episodes. A typical audience was 6.1 million viewers as opposed to 13.8 million for BBC One's Casualty. Raise the Roof has since been described as the last example of the era when it was seen as \\"vulgar\\" to give away large sums of money and more appropriate to give away prizes of the same value instead. Another criticism was that the questions were too easy to generate real suspense, and the pacing was too slow to keep viewers interested. Early editions of the show had both a sponsorship deal with Express Newspapers and a viewer competition where gamecards could be collected freely from all major newsagents and viewers could play along with the show for the chance to win a new house of their own. By the time the series finished however, both the sponsorship and competition had been discontinued due to the poor reception of the show, resulting in the final few episodes being heavily edited to remove all traces of the competition.

United States, 92 U.S. 105 (1876), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the court ruled on judicial jurisdiction in espionage cases., (\\"It may be stated as a general principle, that public policy forbids the maintenance of any suit in a court of justice, the trial of which would inevitably lead to the disclosure of matters which the law itself regards as confidential, and respecting which it will not allow the confidence to be violated.\\") The case was an important precursor to the court's 1953 decision in United States v. Reynolds wherein it recognized the State Secrets Privilege. The case was later referenced and its holding expanded by the Court in the 2005 case of Tenet v. Doe and then again in General Dynamics Corp. v. United States. In Tenet, which involved a contract claim against the CIA brought by Cold War era spies, Court clarified that ‚ÄúTotten precludes judicial review in cases . . . where success depends upon the existence of their secret espionage relationship with the government.‚Äù. In General Dynamics, the Court held that the same logic applied outside the espionage context, with the limitation that ‚Äú[b]oth parties‚Äîthe government no less than petitioners‚Äîmust have assumed the risk that state secrets would prevent the adjudication of claims of inadequate performance.\\". Overview William Alvin Lloyd was employed as a Union spy by President Abraham Lincoln. Lloyd claimed that he was to be paid $200 per month but was ultimately only reimbursed for expenses incurred in the course of his service.92 U.S. at 106. After his death, Lloyd's estate, represented by its executor Enoch Totten, filed suit to recover the promised wages. The United States Court of Claims found as a factual matter that Lloyd had proceeded under contract as a spy but the court was equally divided on whether the President of the United States could unilaterally bind the government to such a contract and opted to dismiss the claim. The Supreme Court took the case and affirmed the lower court's dismissal on the basis that certain secret contracts could not be publicly reviewed by courts.92 U.S. at 107. Issues May a federal court review questions of law related to secret spy contracts or is such review precluded by some form of executive privilege or the law of contracts?92 U.S. 105. Holding The court deemed that an oral contract between a deceased spy and President Lincoln was unenforceable because the very process of consideration in a court might do harm by making public the details of a secret enterprise. Writing for the majority, Justice Field held: ::[P]ublic policy forbids the maintenance of any suit in a court of justice, the trial of which would inevitably lead to the disclosure of matters which the law itself regards as confidential, and respecting which it will not allow the confidence to be violated. . . . Much greater reason exists for the application of the principle to cases of contract for secret services with the government, as the existence of a contract of that kind is itself a fact not to be disclosed. ::Judgment affirmed.92 U.S. at 106-07. Facts and background In July 1861, in the midst of the American Civil War, William Alvin Lloyd was allegedly recruited as a Union spy by President Abraham Lincoln. His mission was to collect intelligence on the movements and positioning of Confederate States of America troops and other information useful to the Union war effort.92 U.S. at 105-06. Lloyd entered the Confederacy on July 16, 1861, at Memphis, Tennessee and was almost immediately jailed for an unrelated crime. Within a day or two he had bought his way out and over the course of the war spent time in Virginia, Georgia, Tennessee, and Louisiana. Although the exact details of the employment contract were disputed‚Äîand the only other party, President Lincoln, had been assassinated‚ÄîLloyd claimed that he was to be paid $200 per month for his service, which would have totaled $9,753.32 by the end of the war. But rather than paying him in full, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton agreed to reimburse Lloyd only for expenses incurred in the course of his service, totaling $2,380. After his death, Lloyd's estate, represented by its executor Enoch Totten, filed suit to recover the promised wages. By the time the suit was filed both Lloyd and President Lincoln, the only two parties to the original oral contract, had died. There was thus little substantive evidence of the original contract upon which decide the case. Nevertheless, the United States Court of Claims found as a factual matter that Lloyd had proceeded to the Confederate States under contract to spy on President Lincoln's behalf. But the court was equally divided on whether the President of the United States had the authority to unilaterally bind the government to such a contract and opted to dismiss the claim. The Supreme Court took Totten's appeal. Opinion In a unanimous opinion authored by Justice Stephen J. Field, the Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Claims's dismissal of the case. \\"It may be stated as a general principle,\\" wrote Justice Field, \\"that public policy forbids the maintenance of any suit in a court of justice, the trial of which would inevitably lead to the disclosure of matters which the law itself regards as confidential, and respecting which it will not allow the confidence to be violated.\\" Citing a number of well-established evidentiary privileges such as those given to communications between spouses, clients and their attorneys, and penitents and clergy, the Court concluded that \\"[m]uch greater reason exists for the application of the principle to cases of contract for secret services with the government, as the existence of a contract of that kind is itself a fact not to be disclosed.\\" Significance Legal historians have identified Totten as an early expression of the State Secrets Privilege later formally adopted by the Supreme Court in United States v. Reynolds. There is one important distinction, however, between the State Secrets Privilege as endorsed by the Supreme Court in United States v. Reynolds and the privilege applied in Totten: under the Reynolds privilege, individual pieces of evidence may be excluded from the record at the government's behest, but the stronger Totten form of the privilege compels dismissal of entire cases where their subject matter is claimed to be too secret for proceedings in open court. This so-called \\"Totten Bar\\" to jurisdiction has been controversial, because rather than eliminating access to particular evidence it often results in dismissal without recourse. Nevertheless, the privileges described and applied in Reynolds and Totten are often understood as two related varieties of the same general privilege. The precise scope of Totten's holding was unclear until 2005. Before the Supreme Court decided Tenet v. Doe in 2005, it appeared that the reasoning of the Totten court might be confined to cases involving espionage where a plaintiff has voluntarily agreed to secrecy and thus contracted away their right to sue.92 U.S. at 106-07 (\\"The service stipulated by the contract was a secret service; the information sought was to be obtained clandestinely, and was to be communicated privately; the employment and the service were to be equally concealed. . . . The secrecy which such contracts impose precludes any action for their enforcement. The publicity produced by an action would itself be a breach of a contract of that kind, and thus defeat a recovery.\\") But Tenet clarified that ‚ÄúTotten precludes judicial review in cases . . . where success depends upon the existence of their secret espionage relationship with the government.‚Äù Then, finally, General Dynamics Corp. v. United States held that the same logic applies even outside the espionage context, so long as ‚Äú[b]oth parties‚Äîthe government no less than petitioners‚Äîmust have assumed the risk that state secrets would prevent the adjudication of claims of inadequate performance.\\" See also *William Alvin Lloyd *Tenet v.

He took part in the French Resistance within the Lib√©ration movement and was arrested by the Gestapo on February 17, 1944 and shot on April 4, 1944. Early life and education Cavaill√®s was born in Saint-Maixent, Deux- S√®vres. After passing his first baccalaur√©at in 1919 and baccalaur√©ats in mathematics and philosophy the following year, he studied at the Lyc√©e Louis- le-Grand, including two years of :fr:classes pr√©paratoires, before entering the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in 1923, reading philosophy. In 1927 he successfully passed the agr√©gation competitive exam. He began graduate studies in Philosophy in 1928 under the supervision of L√©on Brunschvicg. Cavaill√®s won a Rockefeller Foundation scholarship in 1929-1930. In 1931 he travelled extensively in Germany; in G√∂ttingen he conceived, jointly with Emmy Noether, the project of publishing the Cantor--Dedekind correspondence. He was a teaching assistant at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure between 1929 and 1935, then teacher at the Lyc√©e d'Amiens (now :fr:Lyc√©e_Louis-Thuillier) in 1936. In 1937, he successfully defended his doctoral thesesM√©thode axiomatique et formalisme (th√®se principale) and Remarques sur la formation de la th√©orie abstraite des ensembles (th√®se compl√©mentaire) under the direction of L√©on Brunschvicg. at the University of Paris and became a Doctor of Letters in Philosophy. He was then appointed ma√Ætre de conf√©rences in Logic and in General Philosophy at the University of Strasbourg. World War II After the outbreaks of World War II, he was mobilized in 1939 as an infantry lieutenant with the 43rd Regiment, and was later attached to the Staff of the 4th Colonial Division. He was honoured for bravery twice, and was captured on June 11, 1940. At the end of July 1940 he escaped from Belgium and fled to Clermont-Ferrand, where the university of Strasbourg was re-organized. At the end of December 1940, he met Emmanuel d'Astier de la Vigerie, with whom he created a small group of resistance fighters, known as \\"the Last Column\\". To reach a broader audience, it was decided to create a newspaper, which was to become Lib√©ration, the mouthpiece of both Lib√©ration-Sud and Lib√©ration-Nord. Cavaill√®s took an active part in editing the paper. The first edition appeared in July 1941. He was appointed professor at the Sorbonne in 1941, and left Clermont-Ferrand for Paris, where he helped form the Lib√©ration-Nord resistance group, becoming part of its management committee. In April 1942, at the instigation of Christian Pineau, the central Office of Information and Action (BCRA) of London charged him with the task of forming an intelligence network in the Northern Zone, known as \\"Cohors\\". He was ordered by Christian Pineau to pass into the Southern Zone, and Cavaill√®s headed the network and formed similar groups in Belgium and the north of France. In Narbonne he was arrested with Pineau by the French police in September 1942. After a failed attempt at escaping to London, he was interned in Montpellier at the Saint- Paul d' Eyjeaux prison camp from where he escaped at the end of December 1942. The book Cavaill√®s wrote in prison in Montpellier in 1942 was published posthumously in 1946, edited by the epistemologist Georges Canguilhem and the mathematician Charles Ehresmann under the title Sur la logique et la theorie de la science. Denounced as a public enemy by the Vichy regime, and sought by the police, he fled clandestinely to London in February 1943. There he met General Charles de Gaulle on several occasions. Back in France on April 15 he resigned from the management Committee of the Lib√©ration movement in order to dedicate himself entirely to direct action. He was in charge of the sabotage of the stores of the Kriegsmarine in Brittany and German radio installations on the coast. Betrayed by one of his liaison officers, he was arrested on August 28, 1943 in Paris with his sister and her brother-in-law. Tortured, imprisoned in Fresnes then in Compi√®gne, he was transferred to the Citadel from Arras and was arrested on February 17, 1944. This date was chosen for his death until 2015 when it appeared that he was shot on April 4Laurent Thiery, cited in Bernard Pudal, ¬´ CAVAILL√àS Jean ¬ª, in Les Fusill√©s (1940-1944) , √âditions de l'Atelier, Ivry-sur-Seine, 2015 .. Buried in Arras under a wooden cross marked \\"unknown n¬∞5\\", his body was exhumed in 1946 to be buried in the Crypt in the Sorbonne, in Paris. Legacy The Centre Cavaill√®s de l'√âcole Normale Sup√©rieure was established in Paris in 1969, at 3e √©tage au 29 rue d'Ulm, as Centre for the Study of the History and Philosophy of Science. At the formal opening, philosopher Georges Canguilhem said, \\"A philosopher- mathematician loaded with explosives, lucid and reckless, resolute without optimism. If that's not a hero, what is a hero?\\" (Translated from the original French language: \\"Un philosophe math√©maticien bourr√© d'explosifs, un lucide t√©m√©raire, un r√©solu sans optimisme. Si ce n'est pas un h√©ros, qu'est-ce qu'un h√©ros?)Georges Canguihem, Vie et mort de Jean Cavaill√®s, Paris: √âditions Allia, 2004, p. 35. Cavaill√®s is honored in the Heroes of the Resistance postage stamp set. In L'Arm√©e des ombres, a 1969 film directed by Jean-Pierre Melville, the character of Luc Jardie (the Chief) was in part inspired by Cavaill√®s. Jardie's chief operative, recuperating from injuries in a hideaway, has only five books; the title of each is a publication of Cavaill√®s, though the author is shown as \\"Luc Jardie.\\" =Military honours= * Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur * Compagnon de la Lib√©ration ‚Äì decree of 20 November 1944 * Croix de guerre 39/45 * M√©daille de la R√©sistance * Officier de l'Ordre de la Couronne de Belgique (avec palme) * M√©daille de la R√©sistance (Belgique) Works * Sur la deuxi√®me d√©finition des ensemble finis donn√©e par Dedekind [On the second definition of finite sets given by Dedekind], Fundamenta Mathematicae, XIX, 1932, pp. 143-148. * L'√©cole de Vienne au Congr√®s de Prague, Revue de m√©taphysique et de morale, XLII, 1935, pp. 137‚Äì149. * Briefwechsel Cantor-Dedekind, ed. by E.

History Since its birth, Street to Nowhere has gone through many changes. Founded in 2001 by Singer/Songwriter Dave Smallen, Bassist/Backing Vocals Spenser Russell-Snyder and Drummer Stefan Litrownik, the band began as a pop- punk trio and ended up becoming one of the mainstays of the L3 concert series in Oakland . During 2002 the band recorded The Oakland EP and a number of demos, but after high school, the original members of the band went their separate ways, leaving Dave Smallen without a band. This, however, did not stop him from playing shows; still using the name Street to Nowhere, he continued to play solo acoustic shows, including Live 105's Battle of the Bands in 2004, which won him a spot on the local stage at Live 105's BFD that year. Since then Street to Nowhere has shared the stage with bands such as The Format, Gomez, Jack's Mannequin, Two Gallants, OK GO, Maxeen, Reel Big Fish, The Matches, and in 2007 returned to the BFD local stage as headliners. Street to Nowhere has since re-filled the vacancies in the band with drummer Joey Bustos (Link 80)/(Desa), lead guitarist Will Hauser, and bassist Bryce Freeman. On occasion Street to Nowhere is joined on stage by violinist Anton Patzner of Judgement Day, Audrye Sessions, and Bright Eyes. In November 2005, Street to Nowhere released their first full-length album, Charmingly Awkward, at a sold out show at San Francisco's Bottom of the Hill. The album was a bit of a collaborative project with other members of Bay Area bands (including Desa, The Matches, and Push To Talk) who provided vocals for the drunken hollering and singing at the end of the song Tipsy. Anton Patzner (Audrye Sessions, Judgement Day, Bright Eyes) plays the violin in the songs Screamin', Boxcars Boxcars and You Can't Go to Sleep. They released a 7\\" EP in July 2006 through Agent Records featuring the songs \\"Hallelujah\\" (a cover of Leonard Cohen's original) and \\"It's Not Me\\". Street to Nowhere was signed to Capitol Records in June 2006. In 2008, singer/guitarist Dave Smallen announced that Street to Nowhere had been disbanded, and he would now perform under his own name. Since then, Dave has released several albums through his website and iTunes.

The player takes on the role of a young sorcerer whose quest is to collect eleven rings and use them to remake a powerful weapon to defeat an evil god. Plot A great battle was fought between the holy Nexus and the demonic Void ‚Äî who battled over the Rod of Creation, which created the world of Ushka Bau. Their battle was so immense, the rod broke into two pieces, and both gods fled with half. This then took the form of eleven rings. These rings were then entrusted to representatives of each of the six classes (Sorcerer, Knight, Archer, Necromancer, Enchanter and Conjurer). All of the rings have been lost, and the story of the rings has turned to a legend. Master Thalmus has requested the presence of a young sorcerer named Buc, his most promising of students. Buc attempts the quest of finding the rings, restoring the Rod of Creation, and destroying the evil Void once and for all. Gameplay Unlike most role- playing video games of the time, such as Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest, Rings of Power has a style that shared many similarities to PC role-playing games such as Dungeon Master, Wizardry, and A Bard's Tale. The game is very open- ended, contains hundreds of non-player characters with many different dialog choices, and dozens of quests and random events. Practically every location is available from very early in the game. Development According to Naughty Dog, Rings of Power was originally designed for DOS and Amiga computers until publisher Electronic Arts decided at the time that Genesis games were more profitable. As a result, it became Naughty Dog's first console game. The game's sales helped fund the development of Naughty Dog's next project, Way of the Warrior. Vijay Pande, creator of the Folding@home distributed computing disease research project, helped design and code the game. Reception The game has received mixed reviews. MegaTech magazine criticized the controls and difficulty.MegaTech rating, EMAP, issue 6, page 77, June 1992 GamePro claimed it a 'must for video adventurers'.GamePro rating, issue 31, page 52, February 1992 Because the in-game map did not have any locations marked and there was no quest journal, many players criticized the game's difficulty as the goal of the game was achieved through careful attention to detail and constant exploration.

The gunboat entered Confederate States Navy service in February 1863. Construction Early in the American Civil War the Confederate States Navy sought a way to break the blockade imposed by the United States Navy on Apalachicola Bay, which prevented most sea-borne commerce from reaching Apalachicola, Florida, Columbus, Georgia, and other points on the Apalachicola River and its tributary, the Chattahoochee River. The plan was to build seaworthy warships near the industrial center of Columbus, and sail them downriver to Apalachicola Bay to challenge the US Navy ships on blockade duty there. In October 1861 the CS Navy contracted with David S. Johnston of Saffold, Georgia to build a gunboat. Originally expected to be completed in four months, the gunboat was finally delivered 10 months late, on December 8, 1862, still needing work. She was commissioned on February 24, 1863 as the CSS Chattahoochee. The Chattahoochee was a three-masted schooner with two steam engines, long, with a beam of and drawing of water at the stern. Using both engines and sails, it was capable of making a maximum of . Lieutenant Catesby ap Roger Jones was assigned command of the Chattahoochee in July 1862. Jones had been in charge of the conversion of the captured USS Merrimack into the iron-clad CSS Virginia, and served as lieutenant on the Virginia in her first battle. When the Virginia's captain was injured in that battle, Jones succeeded to command of the ship for her battle the next day with the USS Monitor. After arrival in Saffold, Jones was involved in getting construction of the Chattahoochee completed. He complained about the difficulty of finding supplies for the ship. By September, he had his officers assembled, but had no crew. While the Chattahoochee was under construction, the Confederate States Army abandoned the city of Apalachicola, exposing the valleys of the Apalachicola, Chattahoochee, Flint and Chipola rivers to raids and invasions by Union forces. The governors of Alabama, Florida and Georgia appealed to the Army to protect against such invasions by placing obstacles in the Apalachicola River and installing batteries along its banks. By the time the Chattahoochee was commissioned, obstacles in the river blocked its access to Apalachicola Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. In late 1862, a chain attached to sunken rafts had been stretched across the river at the \\"Narrows\\", a series of bends in the river above the city of Apalachicola. The chain caught logs, trees and other debris floating down the river. By March 1, 1863, captured debris was backed up from the chain, thick enough for a man to walk across. Gun batteries had already been placed at Ricco's Bluff and Alum Bluff, respectively upstream from Apalachicola. The \\"Narrows\\" was in the middle of a swamp, but artificial mounds were built on both sides of the river for gun batteries. Early 1863 The Chattahoochee spent the first part of 1863 shaking down, undergoing repairs and training the crew. There were constant problems with the engines, and on January 30, she hit a rock, causing a significant leak. The ship could no longer fulfill its original purpose, to sail down to the Gulf and sink or drive away the blockading US Navy ships. The ship never even made it down to the obstacle at the Narrows, where it could at least have served as a floating battery to help protect the obstacle. Although far from combat, the ship lost crew to death and desertion. In late January 1863 Lt. Jones was transferred to Texas and replaced in late February by Lt. John Julius Guthrie. In early April 1863 the Chattahoochee sailed down the river to visit the gun batteries along the river (although not as far as the Narrows), and then took up station at the town of Chattahoochee, Florida, where the Chattahoochee River joined with the Flint River to form the Apalachicola River. In late May the U.S. Navy learned that a blockade runner, the Fashion, was loading cotton at a landing north of the city of Apalachicola. Lieutenant Commander George H. Morris, of the USS Port Royal sent three boats which seized the Fashion and took her back to the Port Royal. Lt. Guthrie received word of the Union move, and sailed the Chattahoochee down river to aid the Fashion. The Chattahoochee was stopped at a sand bar near the present-day site of Blountstown, where the water was only deep, too shallow for her draft. While waiting to see if the river would rise enough to allow the Chattahoochee to cross the bar, Guthrie learned that the Fashion had been captured and removed from the river, and decided to return to Chattahoochee the next day, May 27. Boiler explosion and final days The crew began stoking the boiler, but did not pump water into it for almost two hours, and the boiler exploded at about noon. Nineteen people aboard the Chattahoochee were killed or died later from their wounds, including two or three who drowned while trying to swim to shore. Word was sent upriver, and another ship reached the wreck in the middle of that night. The dead and wounded were moved to the river banks, where they were exposed to the weather. All day on May 27 a hurricane had been moving towards the valley of the Apalachicola River. The hurricane came ashore as a category 2 storm near the city of Apalachicola around sunrise on May 28. The wounded lay on the shore unprotected from the wind and rain for more than 24 hours as the hurricane passed over. The bodies and the wounded were then taken back to Chattahoochee. The wounded did not received competent medical care until five days after the explosion. A slow leak finally sank the Chattahoochee 40 hours after the explosion. David Johnston, who had built the Chattahoochee, raised the sunken ship, but left it sitting at his boatyard, where much of its gear was removed. Repair of the ship at the Columbus Navy Yard finally started in December, 1863. Lt. George Washington Gift, who had served under Catesby Jones in Virginia and on the Chattahoochee, and then continued on that ship under John Guthrie, was placed in command of the Chattahoochee in March 1864. At the end of April, Gift tried to take the repaired Chattahoochee on a raid on US Navy ships near Apalachicola, but went aground, and Gift transferred to a civilian steamer. In early June Gift was ordered to return the Chattahoochee to the Columbus Navy Yard, and he and his crew were sent to Savannah, Georgia to man the CSS Waterwitch. Repairs to the Chattahoochee were never completed, and she did not return to service before the end of the war. When the Confederates abandoned the Apalachicola River in December 1864, Chattahoochee was moved up the Chattahoochee River; she was scuttled near Columbus on 17 April 1865 to avoid capture, just as Union troops approached the city. Remains Chattahoochee lay underwater until 1963, when her sunken remains were found within the boundaries of Fort Benning. They later were raised and a portion of her hull and her original steam engines once more returned to her home in Columbus, where they were placed on display at the National Civil War Naval Museum. Because she was scuttled and lay submerged for a century, Chattahoochee is the only Confederate Navy gunboat that survived to the modern era.

It is related closely to Judgment Day and often is just another phrase for the Last Judgment or Final Judgement, but is not necessarily part of any eschatology. It is generally contrasted with a particular judgment right after death. The position is hinted at in several places in the Old Testament and in the New, and the Catholic Encyclopedia says (here referring to the Last Judgment) \\"Few truths are more often or more clearly proclaimed in Scripture than that of the general judgment\\". When the individual dies, general judgment holds that the person's final dispensation will await the general judgment of the dead at the end of the world, rather than be judged immediately. Additionally, \\"general judgment\\" may refer not only to the judging of each person, but also to the judgment of nations and peoples. The concept of Last Judgment is similar but distinct. Various Last Judgment scenarios represent different forms of a general judgment, such as a global last judgment or a national last judgment. It is more concerned with the depictions and descriptions of particular versions. A decisive factor in the Last Judgment will be the question of whether the corporal works of mercy were practiced during a lifetime or not. They rate as important acts of charity. Therefore, and according to the biblical sources (Mt 5:31-46), the conjunction of the Last Judgment and the works of mercy is very frequent in the pictorial tradition of Christian art.Ralf van B√ºhren, Caravaggio‚Äôs ‚ÄòSeven Works of Mercy‚Äô in Naples.

Jesus warned his contemporaries that the men of Nineveh, who repented at the preaching of Jonah, and the Queen of the South would testify against them in the judgment.. In the context of dispatching emissaries, Jesus asked them to shake off the dust of cities that would not receive them. In the same speech, Jesus declared woes upon the cities of Chorazin and Bethsaida declaring that the cities of Sodom, Tyre, and Sidon would have a more tolerable outcome in the judgement.-  See also  * Last Judgment * Particular judgment * Pre-advent judgment References Judgment in Christianity Christian terminology ","title":"General judgment"},{"id":"5753946","text":"Edoardo Agnelli (2 January 1892 ‚Äì 14 July 1935) was an Italian entrepreneur and industrialist and principal family shareholder of the Italian car company Fiat.

WhoNamedIt.com. Accessed 6 March 2010. After successfully working as an assistant physician at a military hospital in Soliers, in 1796 he was appointed deputy surgeon at Val-de-Gr√¢ce (H√¥pital d'instruction des arm√©es du Val-de-Gr√¢ce) military hospital in Paris, and in 1799 physician at the National Institution for Deaf Mutes. In Paris, Itard was a student of distinguished physician Ren√© Laennec, inventor of the stethoscope (in 1816). Laennec was a few years younger but had a formal education at the university at Nantes and later became a lecturer and professor of medicine at the Coll√®ge de France. Itard described pneumothorax in 1803; Laennec would provide a fuller description of the condition in 1819. In 1821, Itard published a major work on otology, describing the results of his medical research based on over 170 detailed cases. He is credited with the invention of a Eustachian catheter that is referred to as \\"Itard's catheter\\". Numbness in the tympanic membrane during otosclerosis has the eponymous name of \\"Itard- Cholewa Symptom\\". In 1825, as the head physician at the Institution Royale des sourds-muets, Itard was credited with describing the first case of Tourette syndrome in Marquise de Dampierre, a woman of nobility. Jean Marc Gaspard Itard died on July 5, 1838 at the age of 64 in Paris, France. He is known as an educator of the deaf, and tried his educational theories in the celebrated case of Victor of Aveyron, dramatized in the 1970 motion picture The Wild Child directed by Fran√ßois Truffaut, who also played Itard. However, he was disappointed with the progress he made with Victor. Itard was known to conduct experiments on the deaf students of the Institution Nationale des Sourds-Muets √† Paris in useless attempts to restore their hearing, including delivering electrical shocks, leech therapy, ear surgeries, and various types of internal and external medicinal applications.When the Mind Hears  Harlan Lane  Works  Notes External links  1774 births 1838 deaths People from Alpes-de-Haute-Provence Tourette syndrome 19th-century French physicians 18th-century French physicians ","title":"Jean Marc Gaspard Itard"},{"id":"5753968","title":"Shawne Williams"},{"id":"5753971","text":"is a Japanese internet service provider operated by , a wholly owned subsidiary of Sony.

Guinguettes were popular drinking establishments located in the suburbs of Paris and other cities in France. Guinguettes would also serve as restaurants and, often, as dance venues. The origin of the term comes from guinguet, indicating a sour white light local wine. The 1750 Dictionnaire de la langue fran√ßaise, defined Guinguette as a \\"Small cabaret in the suburbs and the surrounds of Paris, where craftsmen drink in the summer and on Sundays and on Festival days. This term is new. It comes apparently from what are sold in these cabarets: a sour light local green wine, that is called ginguet, such as found around Paris.\\" A Goguette was a similar kind of establishment. History During the 18th century, a consumer revolution led once isolated villages and hamlets outside Paris to be swept up in a booming material culture. Commodities, and particularly alcohol, consumed outside the customs barrier of the city were considerably cheaper, being exempt from state taxes. This encouraged the growth of an entertainment industry just beyond the taxman's reach and a network of drinking establishments was established. They were especially popular on Sundays and holidays, when Parisians would visit to enjoy themselves and to get drunk cheaply.Colin Jones Paris - Biography of a City, p226, Allen Lane 2004, Today, the term 'guinguette' is still used for a waterside refreshment stand, particularly open-air, all over France.Henri Joannis Deberne, Danser en soci√©t√©, Christine Bonneton editor, 3/1999, Paris The development of railways in the 1880s and the establishment of the \\"Gare de la Bastille\\" (Bastille station) with many trains serving the eastern suburbs of Paris (such as Nogent sur Marne) contributed to the success of guinguettes. Geography The majority are on the edges of the Seine and the Marne rivers, and some are in a district that stretches to the outskirts of Rouen. Some guinguettes were however far from the rivers, as the picturesque guinguettes of le Plessis-Robinson built among the chestnut trees. There were hundreds of guinguettes as far away as Nogent-sur-Seine, where the nature of the Seine valley changes most. Tradition decline and return Today guinguettes are an object of nostalgia. The guinguettes were marvelous places to return to lighter times during the mad years of the 1920s. They were obviously an eminent subject for painting during the first half of the 20th century. But television and the ban on bathing in the rivers in the 1960s caused the decline of guinguettes. This ban was justified for reasons of hygiene (water quality deteriorated in the 1960s and 1970s) and safety (the risk due to barge traffic and drowning). In the 1960s, guinguettes became a subject of nostalgia. Many people forgot guinguettes, as the French scriptwriter Michel Audiard had one of his characters point out. Since the 1980s, there has been a small revival, particularly along the Marne river. Even now in 2008, some guinguettes stay open every weekend. As of 2011 a gradual return to modern guinguettes has started.Los Angeles Times June 28, 2011, by Devorah Lauter  See also  *Bal-musette *Goguette *Eug√®ne Imbert References  Movies with guinguettes  * Nogent, Eldorado du dimanche (=\\"Nogent, sunday eldorado\\") - Marcel Carn√©, 1929 * La belle √©quipe (=\\"the fine crew\\") - Julien Duvivier, 1936 with Jean Gabin singing the well-known waltz Quand on s'prom√®ne au bord de l'eau (=\\"walking on the river bank\\") * Casque d'or (=\\"golden helmet\\") - Jacques Becker, 1952  External links  * web site of a guinguette on Marne river * website of the association \\"culture guinguette\\" French culture Dance venues ","title":"Guinguette"},{"id":"5753996","text":"She is a 1935 American film produced by Merian C.

The film reached a new generation of moviegoers with a 1949 re-release. The ancient civilization of Kor is depicted in an Art Deco style with imaginative special effects. The setting is Arctic Siberia, rather than in Africa, as in the first book. With music by Max Steiner, the film stars Helen Gahagan, Randolph Scott and Nigel Bruce. It was hoped that She would follow Cooper's previous success, King Kong. Cooper had originally intended to shoot the film in color, but budget cuts by RKO forced him to shoot the film in black and white at the last minute. However, the black and white film had disappointing results at the box office. It initially lost $180,000, although it later had a successful re- release.Harryhausen, Ray; Vaz, Mark.

Reception Writing for The Spectator in 1935, Graham Greene reviewed the film positively, but gave a disclaimer that as \\"an unrepentant Haggard fan\\" he could not write reasonably about it. Describing the film as showcasing \\"earnestly manly Boy Scout virtues\\", Greene did acknowledge that it \\"bore its symbolism a little heavily\\", and ultimately characterized it as both thrilling and childish.

One of the oldest nonresidential structures in the community is the Cherrydale Volunteer Fire House, built in 1919 to serve as the home of the Cherrydale Volunteer Fire Department. The department supplements the career staff who operate from the Arlington County Fire Department's Station 3, now located west of the Five Points intersection. History 100 px In 1893, a branch post office at Lee Highway and Pollard Street was named Cherrydale, with reference to Dorsey Donaldson's large cherry orchard in back of the present firehouse. Quincy Street was then known as Cherry Valley Road. Settlement in this area began after the Civil War and was stimulated in 1906 by the establishment of The Great Falls and Old Dominion Railway Line. Abandoned in 1935, the track bed became Old Dominion Drive. Military Road was cut through broken and densely wooded country by Army Engineers in 1861 to connect the isolated defensive works at Chain Bridge (Forts Marcy and Ethan Allen) with the Arlington Line.Taken from the \\"Cherrydale\\" historical sign located in front of the Cherrydale Library References Cherrydale Library  External links  *Cherrydale Citizens Association *Cherrydale Housing Market Trends *Our Neighborhoods - Cherrydale Arlington County Page Neighborhoods in Arlington County, Virginia ","title":"Cherrydale, Arlington, Virginia"},{"id":"5754041","text":"Edward Meyer or Ed Meyer is the name of: *Edward C.

It went on to win 4 BattleBots championships. BioHazard's weapon is an electric four-bar lifting arm (technically, an asymmetric linear actuator) used to lift other robots. For much of its reign it was notorious for being difficult to attack and get under due to hinged titanium wedge skirts on all sides and low profile (4 inches tall). BioHazard initially retired in 2002 with a record of 37 head-to-head wins and three losses. BioHazard returned to competition in the ComBots Cup in 2005. The increased power and development of heavyweight spinner robots prevailed, with BioHazard finishing poorly - with one win (a forfeit over Jawbreaker, who was destroyed by Eugene in its first fight) and two losses (loss to Megabyte in 2:15 by tap out; forfeit and a final loss to Brutality in 1:21). The final fight against Brutality was at 11:20pm - about 2 hours after the official fights had ended. Paul Ventimiglia, builder of Brutality, had generously given Carlo an extended postponement while Carlo drove BioHazard back to his shop to repair it after its stunning loss to Megabyte - although it's worth noting that BioHazard still showed clearly visible damage after the repair.

Located approximately from New York City, the site includes a 15,000-seat outdoor concert venue, a 1,000-set outdoor terrace stage, an intimate 440-seat indoor hall, and the Museum at Bethel Woods. Concerts run June through September and feature many types of music genres. History In 1996, Alan Gerry, a longtime Liberty, New York resident and founder of Cablevision Industries, created a not-for-profit organization named the Gerry Foundation with the intent of revitalizing the economy of Sullivan County, which had faced severe hardships following the collapse of the Catskill's Borscht Belt tourism industry. That same year, the Foundation purchased the original Woodstock festival field and hundreds of acres surrounding it, with eventual plans for an arts center. In 1998, the Foundation hosted a three-day festival on the site named \\"Day in the Garden\\", and in 1999 hosted a four-day celebration of the 30th anniversary of the original Woodstock. Planning for the arts center began in 2002, and construction on the $150 million project started two years later. The amphitheatre opened on July 4, 2006 with a performance by the New York Philharmonic. On August 13, 2006, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young performed before 16,000 fans at the new center, 37 years after their historic performance at Woodstock. The on-site museum, exploring the 1969 Woodstock festival and the culture of the 1960s, opened in June 2008. In 2012, Bethel Woods was spun off from the Gerry Foundation into its own 501(c)(3) public nonprofit. The next year, the site opened a conservatory dedicated to expanding youth and teen education programs. The lawn area prior to a show Venues Bethel Woods features a main stage called The Pavilion, with 4,500 covered seats and a natural sloping lawn that can accommodate up to 10,500 people. The outdoor Terrace Stage, near the museum, has space for up to 1,000 people, and the Woodstock Festival Field can accommodate up to 30,000 people. Other venues at the center include 440-seat indoor Event Gallery, the 132-seat Museum Theatre, The Market Sheds event space, and two classrooms. The Museum at Bethel Woods Monument at the site of the 1969 Woodstock festival, installed in 1984. The Museum at Bethel Woods opened in June 2008. It aims to explore the unique experience of the 1969 Woodstock Music & Art Fair and its significance as a culminating event of a decade of radical cultural transformation, along with the continuing legacies of both the 1960s and Woodstock. Permanent exhibits include The Sixties, The Woodstock Festival, Three Days of Peace and Music, and Impact of Woodstock & The Sixties, each featuring film and interactive displays, text panels, and collections of artifacts. In addition to information about the music festival, which is about two-thirds of the museum's scope, the museum offers exhibits, personal stories and a multimedia experience about various aspects of the 1960s, including music, fashion and political protest. It focuses on issues such as the baby boom, Cold War, Vietnam War, Civil Rights Movement, and the assassinations and riots that occurred during the decade, all of which contribute to the context of Woodstock. The museum includes a 132-seat high-definition theater and a gallery, as well as classrooms, a cafe, a museum shop, and a patio. A special exhibit gallery opened in 2009. The Museum, and Bethel Woods Museum Development Group CEO Michael Egan, were the recipients of a 2010 Thea Award for excellence in themed entertainment. =Funding controversy= $1 million in federal funding earmarked for The Museum by the U.S. Senate in June 2007 was criticized after it was revealed the museum founder, Alan Gerry, then donated almost $30,000 to New York Senators Hillary Clinton and Charles Schumer, who had helped to secure the funding. Clinton did not speak during the debate on the project, but Schumer strongly defended the Bethel project as a boon for an economically struggling county. The funding was rescinded in October 2007 following criticism from Republicans led by John McCain, although it did not affect the museum's scheduled opening nor the more than $15 million in state funding.  Economic impact  Bethel Woods offers programs nine months out of the year. Opening the center helped revive tourism, which suffered in the region following the closure of many resorts following the decline of the Borscht Belt. Sullivan County has struggled with the legacy of Woodstock, and officials hoped the museum would help with reconciliation. The opening of the performing arts center in 2006, led to increased development in Bethel, along the Route 17B corridor, and in nearby Kauneonga Lake (formerly North White Lake), and is one of the county's larger economic development programs, despite the initial controversy surrounding some of its funding. A Bethel Woods report from 2018 indicated that $560.82 million of spending has been generated in New York. With 2.9 million visitors since 2006 and 214,405 visitors in 2018, an equivalent of 172 full-time jobs exist as a result, which includes direct wages of $5.1 million from Bethel Woods in Sullivan County.

At the time, she was 18 years old and had been married for eight months to Maal Singh Shekhawat, who had died a day earlier at age 24, and had no children.  Immolation  Several thousand people attended. After her death, Roop Kanwar was hailed as a sati mata ‚Äì a sati mother, or pure mother. The event quickly produced a public outcry in urban centres. The incident led first to state level laws to prevent such incidents, then the central government's Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act. =News reports= News reports of the incident present conflicting stories about the degree to which Kanwar's death was voluntary. Some news reports claim Kanwar was forced to her death by other attendees present. At the same time, there are contradictory reports which claim that Roop Kanwar told her brother-in-law to light the pyre when she was ready. Some reports state that Roop was told she must do Sati to bring honor to the family, and she ran away and hid in a barn, but was found and beaten, drugged. Her male in-laws half dragged her towards the funeral pyre and eye- witnesses testified that she was heavily bruised and bleeding and frothing from the mouth. These witnesses said she was thrown on her husbands dead body and heavy logs placed on her such that she could not move and the funeral pyre was lit. =Chargesheet= The original inquiries resulted in 45 people being charged with her murder; these people were acquitted. A much-publicized later investigation led to the arrest of a large number of people from Deorala, said to have been present in the ceremony, or participants in it. Eventually, 11 people, including state politicians, were charged with glorification of sati. On 31 January 2004 a special court in Jaipur acquitted all of the 11 accused in the case.

It is also known as \\"The Spirit of Thailand\\". History In 1914, the ownership of the privately-owned Sura Bangyikhan Distillery was transferred to the government of Thailand to be under the supervision of the Excise Department, Ministry of Finance. The department then opened a bidding for a concession to raise money for the treasury and authorized the bidder to produce and distribute spirits within a specified area. The concession agreement expired in 1927 during the reign of King Prajadhipok. The Department then cancelled the concession for spirit distillation and distribution before taking over the spirit production on 1 April 1929. The distillery was modernized and it produced a new \\"28-degree\\" blended spirit under a number of brands including \\"Chiang-Chun\\", which is still available today. As for spirit distribution, the department continued with the concession and appointed wholesalers for each area. Later, the Excise Department concocted another blended spirit using herbs combined with a traditional medicated liquor recipe. Herbs and spices were fermented in a spirit of high alcohol content before adding the desired flavor, aroma, and the preferred degree of alcohol. The result was a new kind of spirit which was smooth enough to be drunk neat. It was further developed into a \\"special blended spirit\\" which could be enjoyed neat or with a mix of soda. In those days, the preferred drink was imported whiskey mixed with soda. This imported whiskey resulted in a substantial loss of income to the country each year. The special blended spirit produced by the Excise Department helped reduce imports significantly. Under the government of Field Marshal Plaek Pibulsongkram, Thailand demanded that four provinces located on the right side of the Mekong River be returned from French occupation. This led to the Indochina war. These provinces were Siemrat, Phra Tabong, Si Sophon, and Champasak. Luang Wichitwathakan, the then-Director-General of the Fine Arts Department composed Kham Khong, a patriotic song with Thai lyrics using the melody of the Western song Swanee River. This song was created to remind Thai people of these four provinces so that they would always be remembered as a part of Thailand. The Kham Khong song was very popular and avidly instilled a patriotic sense into the hearts of Thai people. Such a dramatic effect influenced the Excise Department to use \\"Mekhong\\" to name the 35-degree special blended spirit that was newly produced in 1941. Composition Despite being known as a whisky, Mekhong is much more a rum. The distilled spirit is made from 95 percent sugar cane/molasses and five percent rice. The distilled spirit is then blended with indigenous herbs and spices to produce its aroma and taste. Mekhong is distilled, blended, and bottled at the Bangyikhan Distillery on the outskirts of Bangkok. It contains 35 percent alcohol by volume, and it is used in a cocktail called the \\"Thai Sabai\\". In popular culture Mekhong Whisky is mentioned several times on the album Hell's Ditch by The Pogues, along with other common Thai drinks. \\"Mekhong\\" (Mekong) is also the name of a popular song recorded by The Refreshments on the album Fizzy Fuzzy Big & Buzzy. In the song, the singer, at a bar in Bangkok, is recently arrived from Taipei. He repeatedly orders Mekhong for himself and a new friend (whose name he cannot remember), always allowing the bartender to keep the change.

For Wishart and many of his fellow churchmen, the freedom of Scotland and the freedom of the Scottish church were one and the same thing. His support for the national cause was to be of crucial importance at some critical times. Bishop and Guardian Robert Wishart belongs to the Wisharts, or Wisehearts, of Pittarrow, Kincardineshire, a family of Norman-French origin. He was either the cousin or nephew of William Wishart, Bishop of St. Andrews, a former Chancellor of Scotland. Wishart's first recorded office in the church was as archdeacon of St. Andrews. He was appointed Bishop of Glasgow in 1273. As well as a churchman he became a prominent political figure during the reign of Alexander III. After the death of Alexander in 1286 Wishart was one of a panel of six Guardians, appointed to take charge of national affairs for the infant Margaret, Maid of Norway. Although he and his fellow Guardians signed the Treaty of Birgham, which envisaged the future marriage of Margaret to Prince Edward, the eldest son of Edward I, King of England, their agreement was subject to the caveat that the treaty would do nothing to threaten the integrity of the Kingdom of Scotland. The early death of the Maid in 1290 left no generally recognised heir to the throne of Scotland. With the country threatening to descend into a dynastic war between the supporters of Robert Bruce, 5th Lord of Annandale, the grandfather of the future king, and John Balliol, Wishart was closely involved in all of the diplomatic negotiations with King Edward, invited to adjudicate between the rival claimants. When Edward insisted that he be recognised as Lord Paramount of Scotland prior to giving decision in the matter, Wishart pointed out that 'the kingdom of Scotland is not held in tribute or homage to anyone save God alone.' Edward simply sidestepped these objections; and with no means of settling the question by any internal process, he was duly accepted as Overlord by Guardians and Claimants alike. In the great feudal court held at Berwick-upon- Tweed, Bruce and Balliol were allowed to appoint forty auditors each, with Wishart taking his place in the Bruce camp. He remained consistent in his support even when some of his fellow auditors voted for John Balliol, having the superior claim in feudal law. Even so, as a prominent churchman, he remained at the forefront of public affairs during the reign of King John, and was one of those who ratified the Franco-Scottish alliance ‚Äì subsequently to be known as the Auld Alliance ‚Äì in February 1296. After Edward's conquest of Scotland, he along with the other chief men of the realm swore fealty to the English king, . Independence and the Church Almost from the outset, and in spite of his forced oath to Edward, Wishart was involved in the struggle against the English occupation of Scotland. He along with William Lamberton, the Bishop of St. Andrews, and David de Moravia, Bishop of Moray, formed an important clerical foundation for the struggles of William Wallace and Robert Bruce. They were patriots, but in two distinct senses of that term. The Scottish church had long guarded its own independent traditions within the universal church, resisting all attempts to subordinate it to the archdiocese of York, and insisting that no intermediary come between it and Rome. All attempts at dilution were resisted, causing Pope Nicholas IV to censure the clergy in 1289 for objecting to the promotion of foreigners to ecclesiastical office in Scotland. Now Edward's conquest brought with it the prospect once again of submission to York or Canterbury and the appointment of English clergy to vacant Scottish benefices. The hostile Lanercost Chronicle says of Wishart and those like him; :In like manner, as we know, that it is truly written, that evil priests are the cause of the people's ruin, so the ruin of the realm of Scotland had its source within the bosom of her church, ... for with one consent both those who discharged the office of prelate and those who were preachers, corrupted the ears and minds of the nobles, and commons, by advice and exhortation, both publicly and secretly, stirring them to enmity against the king and nation...declaring falsely that it was more justifiable to attack them than the Saracen. Wishart's Rising In 1297, even before William Wallace made his appearance, Wishart was among the early leaders of the rising against the English occupation. According to the Lanercost Chronicle it was he, along with James Stewart, the High Steward of Scotland, who prodded Wallace into action. Wishart's first rising came to a premature end in July 1297 when he surrendered to the English at Irvine, but the ball was rolling and would not stop. The rebel bishop was imprisoned for a time, swore his fealty to Edward anew, only to renounce it as soon as he was released. In May 1301 Edward himself wrote to Pope Boniface in an obvious mood of frustration, requesting Wishart's removal from the see of Glasgow. Boniface would not consent to this, but he wrote to Wishart demanding that he desist in his opposition to Edward, and denouncing him as 'the prime mover and instigator of all the tumult and dissension which has risen between his dearest son in Christ, Edward, King of England, and the Scots.' In the surrender of the patriotic party in February 1304 Wishart was initially condemned to banishment from Scotland for two or three years 'on account of the great evils he has caused.' The Bishop and the Bruce Wishart's tomb in the crypt of Glasgow Cathedral Wishart's defaced effigy On 10 February 1306 Robert Bruce and a small party of supporters killed John Comyn, a leading rival, in the chapel of the Greyfriars, Dumfries. It was an act of political rebellion: perhaps even more serious, it was an act of supreme sacrilege. He now faced the future as an outlaw and an excommunicate, an enemy of the state and the church. It was to be many years before the Pope was prepared to forgive him; but the support of Wishart and the other Scottish bishops was of inestimable importance at this moment of crisis. Bruce went to Glasgow where he met Wishart, in whose diocese the murder had been committed. Rather than excommunicating the earl Wishart immediately gave him absolution and urged his flock to rise in his support. He then accompanied Bruce to Scone, the site of all Scottish coronations. They there met his brother bishops of St Andrews and Moray, as well as other prominent churchmen, in what gives the appearance of a well-arranged plan. Less than seven weeks after the killing in Dumfries, along with a number of prominent lay figures they all witnessed the coronation of King Robert I on 25 March. The country was immediately put on a war footing, with Wishart himself, despite his advancing years, being in the forefront of the preparations. The timber the English had given him to repair the bell tower of Glasgow Cathedral was used for making siege engines, and he took personal charge of the assault on Cupar Castle in Fife, 'like a man of war', as the enemy later complained. All these hopes and efforts were soon frustrated by the advance of an English army under Aymer de Valence in the summer of 1306: Bruce was defeated at the Battle of Methven, soon to be forced into hiding, and Wishart was captured at Cupar. He was taken south in chains, and incarcerated in an English dungeon, saved only from execution by his clerical orders. Edward was delighted with the capture of this 'traitor and rebel', and wrote to the Pope in September telling him that Wishart, along with William de Lamberton, was being held in close confinement, and that custody of the see of Glasgow had been entrusted to Geoffery de Mowbray. Wishart was to remain in prison for the next eight years, going blind in the course of his captivity. He may have been held for some of the time in Wisbech Castle in the Isle of Ely. It was not until after King Robert's triumph at the Battle of Bannockburn that he was released as part of a prisoner exchange. He returned to Scotland to live out his life in relative peace, finally dying in Glasgow in November 1316, 'indisputedly one of the great figures in the struggle for Scottish independence, ... the patron and friend of Wallace and Bruce, the persistent opponent of Plantagenet pretensions, an unheroic hero of the long war.' (Barrow, 1976, p. 372). Final resting place After his death in 1316 his body was entombed at the back of the crypt in Glasgow Cathedral where he was Bishop for much of his life. The tomb is uninscribed and the head of the effigy has been defaced at some point, probably during the Reformation.

It was built to transport cargo-carrying boats on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal in Georgetown across the Potomac River to the Alexandria Canal. The same eight piers supported two different bridges: a wooden canal bridge (a wooden roadway bridge was added on top of the canal later) and an iron truss bridge carrying a roadway and an electric trolley line. The bridge was closed in 1923 after the construction of the nearby Key Bridge. The shuttered Aqueduct Bridge was demolished in 1933. History =First bridge= First Aqueduct Bridge after addition of superstructure and roadway. Note the Howe trusses and arches added for strength. In 1830, merchants from Alexandria, Virginia, which was still part of the District of Columbia at the time, proposed linking their city to Georgetown to capitalize on the new Chesapeake and Ohio Canal.Gillette, p. 18. Congress granted a charter to the Alexandria Canal Company in 1830,Hurst, p. 4-5. and construction soon began on the Aqueduct Bridge that would carry canal boats across the Potomac River and downriver on the south side without unloading in Georgetown. The bridge was designed by Major William Turnbull.Kapsch, p. 136. Construction of the bridge and Alexandria Canal began in 1833, and both were completed in 1843. To withstand Potomac ice floes, the piers were made of gneiss, with icebreakers made of granite.\\"Appendix B B B - Bridges at Washington, D.C.\\", p. 3641. Accessed 2012-12-29. The water-filled bridge was a weatherproofed-timber, queen-post truss construction.Reed, p. 144. The bridge was wide across the top. It had eight piers, each set on riverbottom bedrock and wide at the top. The third and sixth piers were wide at the top. Each pier was designed so that its top was above the mean high water level. A narrow carriageway ran alongside the bridge. Later, a separate level for pedestrian and carriage traffic was added to the bridge. The tolls from the addition inhibited trade between Georgetown and Virginia, thus benefiting Alexandrian businessmen who retained Virginian trade. During the American Civil War, the canal was drained to make a roadway for military troops. View of the Potomac Aqueduct Bridge from Georgetown into Rosslyn, Virginia In 1866, the Alexandria Canal Company leased the bridge for 99 years to three local businessmen. The existing wooden superstructure, which had decayed, was replaced with Howe trusses. Wooden arches were later added to strengthen the Howe trusses. In 1868, Congress passed legislation requiring the lessees of the bridge to maintain a highway on the bridge. To support this construction, the lessees were authorized to charge a toll. A wooden floor was placed atop the Howe trusses, and wooden trestles built on both ends to provide approaches to the bridge. =Second bridge= Aqueduct Bridge from Georgetown, ca. 1900 In the 1882, legislation was introduced in Congress to purchase the Aqueduct Bridge and open it to the public.\\"The Aqueduct Bridge.\\" Washington Post. December 7, 1882. But the bill did not pass. Legislation was again introduced in January 1884.\\"Free Bridge Across the Potomac.\\" Washington Post. January 10, 1884. This legislation was ultimately successful. At issue, however, was who would bear the cost of buying the bridge. Congress initially proposed that the District of Columbia shoulder the entire cost, but the city did not have the funds.\\"The Proposed Free Bridge.\\" Washington Post. February 19, 1884. Citizens in Virginia demanded that Congress pick up cost, arguing this was an interstate bridge and therefore a national concern.\\"Proposed Free Bridge.\\" Washington Post. March 17, 1884. Congress passed the legislation, and appropriated $240,000 to purchase the bridge. The Alexandria Canal Company sold the bridge's piers for $85,000 and its deck for $50,000, and the deed was conveyed to the federal government on August 15, 1884.\\"The Aqueduct Bridge.\\" Washington Post. August 16, 1884. Almost immediately, a dispute broke out among the canal company's shareholders as to the distribution of the funds, which suspended the transfer of deed.\\"The Bridge Dispute.\\" Washington Post. October 13, 1886. The safety of the bridge was quickly called into question. In December 1885, just a year after the bridge was purchased, the United States Army Corps of Engineers conducted a study that found the wooden bridge so unsafe that it should be removed.\\"Two District Bridges.\\" Washington Post. December 24, 1885. Again, cost considerations came to the fore. Legislation was introduced in Congress in May 1886 to have a new bridge built, with the D.C. government picking up half the cost.\\"The Free Bridge Conference.\\" Washington Post. May 28, 1886; \\"Our Free Bridge.\\" Washington Post. May 29, 1886. A D.C. engineering study of the bridge was conducted in September 1886 to again determine the bridge's safety. This report for the bridge so unsafe that it recommended immediate closure.\\"The Aqueduct Bridge Unsafe.\\" Washington Post. September 26, 1886. The District government did so on October 5, 1886.\\"The Aqueduct Bridge.\\" Washington Post. October 4, 1886; \\"The Bridge to Be Closed.\\" Washington Post. October 5, 1886. Second Aqueduct Bridge, some time between 1924 and 1933. On October 20, 1886, the canal company shareholders finally settled on how to distribute the purchase funds amongst themselves. The District government then asked the Secretary of War (who supervised the Corps of Engineers) whether the federal government intended to repair the bridge or build a new one.\\"The Bridge Question.\\" Washington Post. October 21, 1886. But issues concerning the sale still plagued the bridge. Although a new deed of transfer was prepared in mid-November 1886,\\"The Aqueduct Bridge.\\" Washington Post. November 13, 1886. the Alexandria Canal Company sued the federal government in December 1886 to receive the full sale price all at once (rather than in installments).\\"The Aqueduct Bridge.\\" Washington Post. December 22, 1886. Another Corps engineering report on the bridge was made in January 1887.\\"The Aqueduct Bridge Examination.\\" Washington Post. January 7, 1887. With the bridge again found to be unsafe to open, the federal government sued the canal company. The deed of sale, the government said, required the company to maintain a bridge that is open to travel for 20 years. This condition had not been met, and the government sought $84,500 in reimbursements to cover construction of a new deck.\\"The Aqueduct Bridge.\\" Washington Post. January 8, 1887. Meanwhile, the Corps of Engineers reported in January 1887 that a new bridge could be constructed for $105,000 (the sum of money left over from the 1884 appropriation).\\"A New Aqueduct Bridge.\\" Washington Post. January 16, 1887. With this money already in hand, no new legislation was needed. Bids for construction of the new bridge were received in March 1887,\\"Bids for Important Work.\\" Washington Post. March 8, 1887. and a contract awarded to the Mt. Vernon Bridge Company.\\"The Aqueduct Bridge.\\" Washington Post. March 24, 1887. Work began in August.\\"Work on the Aqueduct Bridge.\\" Washington Post. August 13, 1887. But extensive delays plagued the bridge.\\"The New Aqueduct Bridge.\\" Washington Post. November 28, 1887. One reason for the delay was the need to obtain a new right-of-way from the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, which the bridge would cross.\\"The New Aqueduct Bridge.\\" Washington Post. December 8, 1887. Suit for the right-of-way was filed in December 1887, and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal agreed to provide it (pending an appraisal) in January 1888.\\"The Aqueduct Bridge.\\" Washington Post. January 6, 1888. But work continued to be slow due to inefficient work practices by the contractor, delaying the opening until at least January 1889.\\"Work on the Bridges.\\" Washington Post.

In 1889, the northern arch in the Washington abutment was enlarged so that the Georgetown Branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad could pass underneath. When that line was abandoned, Water Street NW was extended west through the passageway to the Washington Canoe Club. The empty lot before the canoe club had previously been occupied by Dempsey's Canoe Livery. The rest of the Georgetown Branch right-of-way is now occupied by the Capital Crescent Trail. One of the piers was replaced in 1900.\\"At Work in River Bed.\\" Washington Post. September 3, 1900. In 1906, the Great Falls and Old Dominion Railroad (GF&OD;) began to operate a single-track electric trolley line on a cantilever structure that the railroad had constructed on the bridge's west (upstream) side.Harwood, pp. 37-38. In 1912, the GF&OD; became the Great Falls Division of the new Washington and Old Dominion Railway.Harwood, pp. 42-49 Building Key Bridge Proposals were made to replace Aqueduct Bridge as early as 1901.\\"Plans for New Bridge.\\" Washington Post.

Built by the Great Falls and Old Dominion Railroad, trolleys of the railroad and its successor, the Washington and Old Dominion Railway, traversed the bridge until its closure in 1923. Ice jams were a routine hazard on the Potomac River into the 1960s. Although the jams often stuck against the bridge, it weathered them well until 1908. Ice damaged some of the bridge's piers, requiring reconstruction of Pier No. 1 in the summer.\\"Pier Nearing Completion.\\" Washington Post. June 17, 1908. Engineers discovered that many of the bridge's piers had been undermined by water, and rush repairs were made.\\"Holes in Bridge Piers.\\" Washington Post. October 15, 1908; \\"Bridge in Good Condition.\\" Washington Post. October 16, 1908. But the aging structure continued to suffer damage, and by September 1912 the bridge was leaning dangerously to the west.\\"Points to Adqueduct Bridge.\\" Washington Post. September 15, 1912. Fears that the bridge would give way during the spring ice jams worsened. The bridge piers were extensively repaired again in 1913. =The Carlin bill= In March 1914, Representative Charles Creighton Carlin of Virginia sponsored legislation to replace Aqueduct Bridge with a new, $1 million structure.\\"To Push Bridge Bill.\\" Washington Post. March 17, 1914. The Commissioners of the District of Columbia (the city's appointed government) approved of the new bridge in June.\\"Urge Bridge Improvement.\\" Washington Post. March 19, 1914; \\"Approve Bridge Plan.\\" Washington Post. June 20, 1914. Controversy over the new bridge immediately broke out. Senator Claude A. Swanson, chairman of the Senate Committee on Public Works, wanted the new bridge built about downstream at the mouth of Rock Creek (at about 30th Street NW), where it would cross Analostan Island and the Potomac River to Rosslyn.\\"Wants 2 New Bridges.\\"Washington Post. July 10, 1914. Georgetown merchants strongly opposed this plan.\\"Fights Bridge Change.\\" Washington Post. July 13, 1914; \\"Near the Old Bridge.\\" Washington Post.\\" July 15, 1914. There were some in Congress who wanted to repair the existing bridge, but a study by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in August 1914 showed that the existing structure was inadequate for the amount of traffic and too unstable to be saved.\\"Wants A New Bridge.\\" Washington Post. August 12, 1914. Secretary of War Lindley Miller Garrison, who oversaw the Corps, agreed that a new bridge was necessarily in December.\\"Agree on New Bridge.\\" Washington Post. December 25, 1914. Rep. William C. Adamson, chairman of the House Committee on Public Works, challenged Swanson and declared that the new bridge should be placed where the old one was.\\"Adamson Declares Aqueduct Bridge Inadequate, Unsafe, and Unsightly.\\" Washington Post. January 9, 1915. The Carlin bill began moving through the House in January 1915. But House members balked at the cost.\\"Plead for New Bridge.\\" Washington Post. January 9, 1915. Garrison tried to break the deadlock on January 9 by issuing a report that declared the existing bridge unsafe, and requesting that the new one be built in the same location.\\"Finds Old Bridge Bad.\\" Washington Post. January 10, 1915. The D.C. Commissioners said the location of the bridge was up to them,\\"Aqueduct Plans Held Up.\\" Washington Post.

October 29, 1915; \\"Old Bridge Is Unsafe.\\" Washington Post. January 8, 1916. Swanson changed his mind, and agreed in January 1916 that the new bridge should be built on the existing site.\\"Bridge Plea to Garrison.\\" Washington Post. January 21, 1916. Garrison endorsed the Carlin bill on January 27.\\"Garrison For New Bridge.\\" Washington Post. January 28, 1916.

The pilings were blasted out to a depth of below the waterline. The Aqueduct Bridge's Washington abutment and a remnant of the bridge's Virginia abutment still survive. Both are located a short distance west (upstream) of the Key Bridge. The southern arch of the Washington abutment shelters rowing shells belonging to members of the Potomac Boat Club. Between the abutments, the preserved pier remains in place near the river's Virginia shoreline. A coalition of Georgetown business groups and residents have joined with Georgetown University to advocate the construction of a gondola that would cross the river along the former path of the Aqueduct Bridge. Conceptual images show that a pole supporting the gondola's cables would rise from the bridge's remaining pier.

Carbohydrates are normally converted into simple sugars (monosaccharides) by alpha-glucosidase enzymes present on cells lining the intestine, enabling monosaccharides to be absorbed through the intestine. Hence, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors reduce the impact of dietary carbohydrates on blood sugar. Examples and differences Examples of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors include: * Acarbose- Precose or Glucobay * Miglitol ‚Äì Glyset * Voglibose Even though the drugs have a similar mechanism of action, there are subtle differences between acarbose and miglitol. Acarbose is an oligosaccharide, whereas miglitol resembles a monosaccharide. Miglitol is fairly well absorbed by the body, as opposed to acarbose. Moreover, acarbose inhibits pancreatic alpha-amylase in addition to alpha- glucosidase. Natural alpha glucosidase inhibitors There are a large number of natural products with alpha-glucosidase inhibitor action. For example, research has shown the culinary mushroom Maitake (Grifola frondosa) has a hypoglycemic effect. The reason Maitake lowers blood sugar is because the mushroom naturally contains an alpha glucosidase inhibitor. Another plant attracting a lot of attention is Salacia oblonga. / Clinical use Alpha- glucosidase inhibitors are used to establish greater glycemic control over hyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus type 2, particularly with regard to postprandial hyperglycemia. They may be used as monotherapy in conjunction with an appropriate diabetic diet and exercise, or they may be used in conjunction with other anti-diabetic drugs. In patients with diabetes mellitus type 1, Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors use has not been officially approved by the Food and Drug Administration but some data exists on the effectiveness in this population, showing potential benefits weighted against an increased risk of hypoglycemia.Alternative Agents in Type 1 Diabetes in Addition to Insulin Therapy: Metformin, Alpha-Glucosidase Inhibitors, Pioglitazone, GLP-1 Agonists, DPP-IV Inhibitors, and SGLT-2 Inhibitors. Michelle DeGeeter, PharmD, CDE, Bobbie Williamson, PharmD, BCACP, CDE. Journal of Pharmacy Practice Vol 29, Issue 2, pp. 144 - 159. First Published October 13, 2014 https://doi.org/10.1177/0897190014549837 Mechanism of action Alpha- glucosidase inhibitors are saccharides that act as competitive inhibitors of enzymes needed to digest carbohydrates: specifically alpha-glucosidase enzymes in the brush border of the small intestines. The membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucosidases hydrolyze oligosaccharides, trisaccharides, and disaccharides to glucose and other monosaccharides in the small intestine. Acarbose also blocks pancreatic alpha-amylase in addition to inhibiting membrane-bound alpha-glucosidases. Pancreatic alpha-amylase hydrolyzes complex starches to oligosaccharides in the lumen of the small intestine. Inhibition of these enzyme systems reduces the rate of digestion of carbohydrates. Less glucose is absorbed because the carbohydrates are not broken down into glucose molecules. In diabetic patients, the short-term effect of these drugs therapies is to decrease current blood glucose levels: the long-term effect is a small reduction in hemoglobin A1c level. Dosing Since alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are competitive inhibitors of digestive enzymes, they must be taken at the start of main meals to have maximal effect. Their effects on blood sugar levels following meals will depend on the amount of complex carbohydrates in the meal. Side effects and precautions Since alpha- glucosidase inhibitors prevent the degradation of complex carbohydrates into glucose, the carbohydrates will remain in the intestine. In the colon, bacteria will digest the complex carbohydrates, thereby causing gastrointestinal side effects such as flatulence and diarrhea. Since these effects are dose-related, it is generally advised to start with a low dose and gradually increase the dose to the desired amount. Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis is another reported side effect. If a patient using an alpha- glucosidase inhibitor suffers from an episode of hypoglycemia, the patient should eat something containing monosaccharides, such as glucose tablets. Since the drug will prevent the digestion of polysaccharides (or non- monosaccharides), non-monosaccharide foods may not effectively reverse a hypoglycemic episode in a patient taking an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor.

It is a common complication of bacterial infections, typically skin infection by Streptococcus bacteria types 12, 4 and 1 (impetigo) but also after streptococcal pharyngitis, for which it is also known as postinfectious glomerulonephritis (PIGN) or poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). It can be a risk factor for future albuminuria. In adults, the signs and symptoms of infection may still be present at the time when the kidney problems develop, and the terms infection-related glomerulonephritis or bacterial infection-related glomerulonephritis are also used. Acute glomerulonephritis resulted in 19,000 deaths in 2013, down from 24,000 deaths in 1990 worldwide. Signs and symptoms Hematuria Among the signs and symptoms of acute proliferative glomerulonephritis are the following: * Hematuria * Oliguria * Edema * Hypertension * Fever (headache, malaise, anorexia, nausea.) Causes Acute proliferative glomerulonephritis (post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis) is caused by an infection with streptococcus bacteria, usually three weeks after infection, usually of the pharynx or the skin, given the time required to raise antibodies and complement proteins.Marianne Gausche-Hill, Susan Fuchs, Loren Yamamoto, American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of Emergency Physicians. \\"APLS: The Pediatric Emergency Medicine Resource\\". Jones & Bartlett Learning; 2004. The infection causes blood vessels in the kidneys to develop inflammation, this hampers the renal organs ability to filter urine. Acute proliferative glomerulonephritis most commonly occurs in children. Pathophysiology The pathophysiology of this disorder is consistent with an immune-complex-mediated mechanism, a type III hypersensitivity reaction. This disorder produces proteins that have different antigenic determinants, which in turn have an affinity for sites in the glomerulus. As soon as binding occurs to the glomerulus, via interaction with properdin, the complement is activated. Complement fixation causes the generation of additional inflammatory mediators. Complement activation is very important in acute proliferative glomerulonephritis. Apparently immunoglobulin (Ig)-binding proteins bind C4BP. Complement regulatory proteins (FH and FHL-1), may be removed by SpeB, and therefore restrain FH and FHL-1 recruitment in the process of infection. Diagnosis Acute Glomerulonephritis. The following diagnostic methods can be used for acute proliferative glomerulonephritis: * Kidney biopsy * Complement profile * Imaging studies * Blood chemistry studies Clinically, acute proliferative glomerulonephritis is diagnosed following a differential diagnosis between (and, ultimately, diagnosis of) staphylococcal and streptococcal impetigo. Serologically, diagnostic markers can be tested; specifically, the streptozyme test is used and measures multiple streptococcal antibodies: antistreptolysin, antihyaluronidase, antistreptokinase, antinicotinamide-adenine dinucleotidase, and anti-DNAse B antibodies. = Differential diagnosis = The differential diagnosis of acute proliferative glomerulonephritisis is based on the following: Prevention Antibiotic type It is unclear whether or not acute proliferative glomerulonephritis (i.e., poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis) can be prevented with early prophylactic antibiotic therapy, with some authorities arguing that antibiotics can prevent development of acute proliferative glomerulonephritis Treatment Acute management of acute proliferative glomerulonephritis mainly consists of blood pressure (BP) control. A low-sodium diet may be instituted when hypertension is present. In individuals with oliguric acute kidney injury, the potassium level should be controlled. Thiazide or loop diuretics can be used to simultaneously reduce edema and control hypertension; however electrolytes such as potassium must be monitored. Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and/or ACE inhibitors may be added if blood pressure is not effectively controlled through diureses alone.

Erosion risks The disastrous landslide of a hill side in 1993 which caused the 12-story Highland Tower to collapse, the 1999 landslide and the 6 December 2008 landslide indicate that this area has a high risk potential for landslide. This can be attributed to the convergence of 3 factors: rainfall, steep hill sides, and soil type/geological foundation. In a tropical country high rainfall through the year is common, and very high intensity rain during south west and north east monsoons in December and May can be as high as 350 mm a month. Due to the spillover of the East Coast Monsoon rainfall, critical holding capacity can be overwhelmed. This results in highly saturated soils. In addition to the rain, the steep slopes and soil type are other factors contributing to a high risk of landslides. Geologically, these areas often consist of shale or schist which easily weathers to deep clay-like material of oxic or ferralictic nature, which absorbs water through its deep profile instead of allowing a surface runoff. This may lead to a critical point which results in mass movement of soil. According to the reconnaissance soil map from the Department of Agriculture, the soil type of the Mountain Area can be of granitic materials (Rengam- Jerangau soil series) while the lower hilly area of Bukit Antarabangsa most probably consist of shale or sandstone materials, which give risk.

DPP4 is related to FAP, DPP8, and DPP9. The enzyme was discovered in 1966 by Hopsu-Havu and Glenner, and as a result of various studies on chemism, was called dipeptidyl peptidase IV [DP IV].  Function  The protein encoded by the DPP4 gene is an enzyme expressed on the surface of most cell types and is associated with immune regulation, signal transduction, and apoptosis. It is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein, but a soluble form, which lacks the intracellular and transmembrane part, is present in blood plasma and various body fluids. DPP-4 is a serine exopeptidase that cleaves X-proline or X-alanine dipeptides from the N-terminus of polypeptides. Peptide bonds involving the cyclic amino acid proline cannot be cleaved by the majority of proteases and an N-terminal X-proline \\"shields\\" various biopeptides. Extracellular proline-specific proteases therefore play an important role in the regulation of these biopeptides. DPP-4 is known to cleave a broad range of substrates including growth factors, chemokines, neuropeptides, and vasoactive peptides. The cleaved substrates lose their biological activity in the majority of cases, but in the case of the chemokine RANTES and neuropeptide Y, DPP-4 mediated cleavage leads to a shift in the receptor subtype binding. DPP4 plays a major role in glucose metabolism. It is responsible for the degradation of incretins such as GLP-1. Furthermore, it appears to work as a suppressor in the development of some tumors. DPP-4 also binds the enzyme adenosine deaminase specifically and with high affinity. The significance of this interaction has yet to be established.  Animal studies  Animal studies suggest its pathogenetic role in development of fibrosis of various organs, such as liver and kidney.  Clinical significance  CD26/DPPIV plays an important role in tumor biology, and is useful as a marker for various cancers, with its levels either on the cell surface or in the serum increased in some neoplasms and decreased in others. A class of oral hypoglycemics called dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors works by inhibiting the action of this enzyme, thereby prolonging incretin effect in vivo. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus has been found to bind to DPP4. It is found on the surface of cells in the airways (such as the lungs) and kidneys. Scientists may be able to use this to their advantage by blocking the virus's entry into the cell.

Due to the observational difficulties NGC 7142 presents, it has been an infrequent topic of research. Current known studies include only work being done at the University of Kansas. Description NGC 7142 is located near the reflection nebula NGC 7129, which is a first indication that the cluster may be obscured by an interstellar cloud. Many studies have demonstrated this to be true dating back to the earliest investigations of this cluster. A thorough study of the Cepheus region concluded \\"that no part of the field may be considered unobscured.\\" Other astronomers have noted that the reddening across the face of this cluster is likely to be uneven. The visibility of several background galaxies in the NW corner of the cluster indicate that the obscuring medium may be lowest here. Estimates of the amount of reddening range from 0.18 magnitudes, to as high as 0.41 magnitudes. Due to the uncertain amount of interstellar reddening, precise determination of age for this cluster has been especially difficult. Based on NGC 7142's Color- magnitude diagram, it is believed that this cluster is close in age to the old open clusters M 67 and NGC 188 (although age determinations for these two clusters varies wildly in the literature). This makes it one of the oldest open clusters currently known. Although thought to be an old cluster, NGC 7142 contains a surprisingly high number of blue stars. This runs contrary to the standard model of cluster evolution which predicts that old clusters should be devoid of such stars since bluer stars are more massive and thus evolve and die off faster, which should prevent them from still being present. Such stars are said to be blue stragglers. The distance to this cluster has also been difficult to determine, again, owing to the absorption. Estimates for the Distance modulus range from 12.5 to 14.5. Due to the similarities between NGC 7142 and NGC 188 in both age and density, some astronomers have speculated that NGC 7142 should be home to a high number of a rare type of variable star known as W UMa since NGC 188 has a high number. Crinklaw & Talbert conducted a search for such stars in 1991, but their study only revealed one variable star. However, their investigation only spanned two days, which did not afford enough data points to determine the type of variable. Roughly two more nights of data were appended to the beginning of the Crinklaw & Talbert study but have still not given enough information to classify the variable star.

In hemodialysis, vascular access is used to remove the patient's blood so that it can be filtered through the dialyzer. Three primary methods are used to gain access to the blood: an intravenous catheter, an arteriovenous fistula (AV) or a synthetic graft. In the latter two, needles are used to puncture the graft or fistula each time dialysis is performed. The type of vascular access created for patients on hemodialysis is influenced by factors such as the expected time course of a patient's kidney failure and the condition of his or her vasculature. Patients may have multiple accesses, usually because an AV fistula or graft is maturing and a catheter is still being used. The creation of all these three major types of vascular accesses requires surgery.Kallenbach J.Z.In: Review of hemodialysis for nurses and dialysis personnel. 7th ed. St. Louis, Missouri:Elsevier Mosby; 2005. Catheter Catheter access, sometimes called a CVC (central venous catheter), consists of a plastic catheter with two lumens (or occasionally two separate catheters) which is inserted into a large vein (usually the vena cava, via the internal jugular vein or the femoral vein) to allow large flows of blood to be withdrawn from one lumen, to enter the dialysis circuit, and to be returned via the other lumen. However, blood flow is almost always less than that of a well functioning fistula or graft. Catheters are usually found in two general varieties, tunnelled and non- tunnelled. Non-tunnelled catheter access is for short-term access (up to about 10 days, but often for one dialysis session only), and the catheter emerges from the skin at the site of entry into the vein. Tunnelled catheter access involves a longer catheter, which is tunnelled under the skin from the point of insertion in the vein to an exit site some distance away. It is usually placed in the internal jugular vein in the neck and the exit site is usually on the chest wall. The tunnel acts as a barrier to invading microbes, and as such, tunnelled catheters are designed for short- to medium-term access (weeks to months only), because infection is still a frequent problem. Aside from infection, venous stenosis is another serious problem with catheter access. The catheter is a foreign body in the vein and often provokes an inflammatory reaction in the vein wall. This results in scarring and narrowing of the vein, often to the point of occlusion. This can cause problems with severe venous congestion in the area drained by the vein and may also render the vein, and the veins drained by it, useless for creating a fistula or graft at a later date. Patients on long-term hemodialysis can literally 'run out' of access, so this can be a fatal problem. Catheter access is usually used for rapid access for immediate dialysis, for tunnelled access in patients who are deemed likely to recover from acute kidney injury, and for patients with end-stage kidney failure who are either waiting for alternative access to mature or who are unable to have alternative access. Catheter access is often popular with patients, because attachment to the dialysis machine doesn't require needles. However, the serious risks of catheter access noted above mean that such access should be contemplated only as a long-term solution in the most desperate access situation. Permacath for dialysis AV fistula A radiocephalic fistula. Illustration depicting AV fistula during hemodialysis AV (arteriovenous) fistulas are recognized as the preferred access method. To create a fistula, a vascular surgeon joins an artery and a vein together through anastomosis. Since this bypasses the capillaries, blood flows rapidly through the fistula. One can feel this by placing one's finger over a mature fistula. This is called feeling for \\"thrill\\" and produces a distinct 'buzzing' feeling over the fistula. One can also listen through a stethoscope for the sound of the blood \\"whooshing\\" through the fistula, a sound called bruit. Fistulas are usually created in the nondominant arm and may be situated on the hand (the 'snuffbox' fistula'), the forearm (usually a radiocephalic fistula, or so-called Brescia-Cimino fistula, in which the radial artery is anastomosed to the cephalic vein), or the elbow (usually a brachiocephalic fistula, where the brachial artery is anastomosed to the cephalic vein). Though less common, fistulas can also be created in the groin, though the creation process differs. Placement in the groin is usually done when options in the arm and hands are not available due to anatomy or the failure of fistulas previously created in the arms/hands. A fistula will take a number of weeks to mature, on average perhaps 4‚Äì6 weeks. During treatment, two needles are inserted into the vein, one to draw blood and one to return it. The orientation of the needles takes the normal flow of the blood into account. The \\"arterial\\" needle draws blood from the \\"upstream\\" location while the \\"venous\\" needle returns blood \\"downstream\\". This sequence prevents partial recycling of the same blood through the dialysis machine, which would lead to less effective treatment. The advantages of the AV fistula use are lower infection rates, because no foreign material is involved in their formation, higher blood flow rates (which translates to more effective dialysis), and a lower incidence of thrombosis. The complications are fewer than with other access methods. If a fistula has a very high blood flow and the vasculature that supplies the rest of the limb is poor, a steal syndrome can occur, where blood entering the limb is drawn into the fistula and returned to the general circulation without entering the limb's capillaries. This results in cold extremities of that limb, cramping pains, and, if severe, tissue damage. One long-term complication of an AV fistula can be the development of an aneurysm, a bulging in the wall of the vein where it is weakened by the repeated insertion of needles over time. To a large extent the risk of developing an aneurysm can be reduced by carefully rotating needle sites over the entire fistula, or using the \\"buttonhole\\" (constant site) technique. Aneurysms may necessitate corrective surgery and may shorten the useful life of a fistula. Fistulas can also become blocked due to blood clotting or infected if sterile precautions are not followed during needle insertion at the start of dialysis. Because of the high volume of blood flowing through the fistula, excessive bleeding can also occur. This is most common soon after a dialysis treatment. Pressure must be applied to the needle holes to induce clotting. If that pressure is removed prematurely or a patient engages in physical activity too soon after dialysis, the needle holes can open up. To prevent damage to the fistula and aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm formation, it is recommended that the needle be inserted at different points in a rotating fashion. Another approach is to cannulate the fistula with a blunted needle, in exactly the same place. This is called a 'buttonhole' approach. Often two or three buttonhole places are available on a given fistula. This also can prolong fistula life and help prevent damage to the fistula. A recent study that was published in The American Journal of Pathology, provides information about the mechanisms underlying failure of the most common type of hemodialysis vascular access, the arteriovenous fistula. In spite of AV Fistula being one of the most preferred methods of Vascular access, the researchers observed that, up to 60% of newly created fistulas never become usable for dialysis because they fail to mature (meaning the vessels do not enlarge enough to support the dialysis blood circuit.). This study suggests that, the impairment in responsiveness to nitric oxide that occurs in some patients with end-stage renal disease may result in hyperplasia (excessive growth) of the innermost layer of the blood vessels or reduced ability of the vessels to dilate. Either abnormality can limit the maturation and viability of the arteriovenous fistula. This research raises the possibility that therapeutic restoration of nitric oxide responsiveness through manipulation of local mediators may prevent fistula maturation failure in patients and potentially contribute to their ability to remain on hemodialysis. AV graft An arteriovenous graft. AV (arteriovenous) grafts are much like fistulas in most respects, except that an artificial vessel is used to join the artery and vein. The graft usually is made of a synthetic material, often PTFE, but sometimes chemically treated, sterilized veins from animals are used. Grafts are inserted when the patient's native vasculature does not permit a fistula. They mature faster than fistulas, and may be ready for use several weeks after formation (some newer grafts may be used even sooner). However, AV grafts are at high risk to develop narrowing, especially in the vein just downstream from where the graft has been sewn to the vein. Narrowing often leads to thrombosis (clotting). As foreign material, they are at greater risk for becoming infected. More options for sites to place a graft are available, because the graft can be made quite long. Thus a graft can be placed in the thigh or even the neck (the 'necklace graft'). Fistula First project AV fistulas have a much better access patency and survival than do venous catheters or grafts. They also produce better patient survival and have far fewer complications compared to grafts or venous catheters. For this reason, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid (CMS) has set up a Fistula First Initiative,Fistula First Initiative whose goal is to increase the use of AV fistulas in dialysis patients. This initiative has had many successes, but fistula is not always the superior strategy when it comes to the elderly. There is ongoing research to make bio-engineered blood vessels, which may be of immense importance in creating AV fistulas for patients on hemodialysis, who do not have good blood vessels for creation of one. It involves growing cells which produce collagen and other proteins on a biodegradable micromesh tube followed by removal of those cells to make the 'blood vessels' storable in refrigerators.

Plot Five teenagers ‚Äî Kate (Margo Harshman), Zack (Greg Cipes), Vicky, Riff, and Ashley ‚Äî are on their way to pan for gold during Spring Break when they make a wrong turn. They encounter two strange men, Pig and Garth, who warn them to return home, saying there have been murders in the area. Making their way into town, four of the teens head inside a store, where they meet brothers Simon (Crispin Glover) and Stanley. Simon is unhelpful, denying the teens requests to buy anything. Frustrated, the group leaves and finds a campsite. Unbeknownst to them, there is someone observing the teens, dressed in a ghillie suit. He chases Ashley through the woods before realizing that she is not 'dream girl' and murders her. The attacker - revealed to be Stanley - begins to cut up her body, saying that he will make her into a present for 'dream girl'. Back at the store, Zack arrives to find it closed and empty. He lets himself in and discovers numerous bodies hanging from the ceiling, including those of Pig, Garth and Clay. Zack pulls several newspaper articles off the bodies, as he then flees the store. After dark, Simon arrives and tells the teens Stanley is missing. At this moment, a terrified Zack arrives and manages to convince Simon to leave. The teens find their van's tires punctured, stranding them. The group heads into the forest to look for Ashley and discover that Stanley has made a 'doll' out of Ashley's head, hands, and feet. They are watched by Stanley, who kills Riff, while Simon kills Vicky. Kate is stopped by Simon in his truck, who lies and tells her that the others are safe at his store. Zack sneaks up and climbs into the truck bed as Kate gets into the truck. While they are driving, Simon explains that he and Stanley have lived in the area their entire lives with their parents Quinn and Carrie, and took over the gas station when Quinn and Carrie died. Simon takes Kate to an old campsite where two long-decayed bodies are sitting at a picnic table. He ties her to the table when Stanley appears in his ghillie suit. Suspicious, Simon chops off several of Stanley's fingers with a cleaver, and it's revealed that it is actually Zack in the suit, trying to masquerade as Stanley. Simon ties Zack to a tree and tortures him. Zack confesses his love to Kate calling her his 'Dream Girl.' This angers Simon and he burns Zack alive. Turning back to Kate, Simon announces that he is also Stanley, having taken over his brother's identity after murdering Quinn and Carrie while the real Stanley is in a coma. Kate seduces Simon, distracting him; he accidentally frees her in the ensuing struggle, allowing her to flee. Returning to Zack's charred body, Kate promises to kill Simon. Moments later, Simon also approaches the body, vowing to kill her. Kate bursts from Zack's corpse where she was hiding, bringing the cleaver down on Simon's head. He falls to the ground, but when she looks down at where his corpse should be, he is gone. A hand reaches for her just before the film cuts to black. The film ends with another group of youths arriving at the store asking Simon for directions. Put off by his strange behavior, they leave.

Biography Weil was born in Sulzburg, then part of the Grand Duchy of Baden. Arabian Nights, \\"Tousend und Eine Nacht, Arabische Erzahlungen\\", translated into German by Gustav Weil, Vol .4, 1866 CE Being destined for the rabbinate, he was taught Hebrew, as well as German and French; and he received instruction in Latin from the minister of his native town. At the age of twelve he went to Metz, where his grandfather was rabbi, to study the Talmud. For this, however, he developed very little taste, and he abandoned his original intention of entering upon a theological career. In 1828 he entered the University of Heidelberg, devoting himself to the study of philology and history; at the same time he studied Arabic under Umbreit. Though without means, he nevertheless went to study under De Sacy in Paris in 1830, and thence followed the French military expedition to Algiers, acting as correspondent at Algiers for the Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung. This position he resigned in January, 1831, and journeyed to Cairo, where he was appointed instructor of French at the Egyptian Medical School of Abu-Zabel. He utilized the opportunity to study with the Arabic philologists Mohammed Ayyad al- Tantawi and A·∏•mad al-Tunsi. Here also he acquired Neo-Persian and Turkish, and, save for a short interruption occasioned by a visit to Europe, he remained in Egypt till March, 1835. Weil returned to Europe by way of Constantinople, where he remained for some time pursuing Turkish studies. In Germany he sought permission to establish himself as privat-docent in the University of Heidelberg, receiving it, however, only after great difficulties. Weil had attacked Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall in a translation of Zamakhshari's Golden Necklaces (Stuttgart, 1836), and the faculty of Heidelberg, being unable to judge the matter, hesitated to appoint him docent because of Hammer-Purgstall's high reputation. De Sacy's recommendation opened the way to him, which, however, was destined to remain rough and rugged. He gained his livelihood as assistant librarian, and was appointed librarian in 1838, which position he retained till 1861; in that year he became professor. At Stuttgart in 1837 Weil published Die Poetische Literatur der Araber, and later issued a translation of the Thousand and One Nights, the first complete translation from the original text into German (4 vols., 1837‚Äì41; 2d ed. 1866; 4th ed. 1871-72), which was, however, spoiled in the process of publication. Weil purposed to give a philologically exact version, which would have been highly desirable in many respects; but the Stuttgart publisher authorized August Lewald to change many objectionable passages, and thus made of it a popular and salable work. This perversion caused Weil much vexation. Weil's second great work was Mohammed, der Prophet (Stuttgart, 1843), a life of Mohammed.in the compilation of which he was the first to go back to the oldest accessible sources in Europe. It was not in his nature, however, to attempt a psychological reconstruction of the prophet's character, as was done later by Aloys Sprenger and Muir. Washington Irving in his Life of Mohammed used Weil's work as a source of information, and acknowledged his indebtedness to that author. While pursuing these studies Weil published his Historisch-Kritische Einleitung in den Koran (Bielefeld and Leipsic, 1844 and 1878) as a supplement to Ullman's translation of the Koran, and the translation of one of the original sources of the biography of Mohammed, Leben Mohammed's nach Muhammed ibn Is·∏•a·∏≥, Bearbeitet von Abd el-Malik ibn Hisch√¢m (Stuttgart, 2 vols., 1864). Three additional essays remain to be mentioned: one on Mohammed's epilepsy (Journal Asiatique, July, 1842); the second an investigation of a Supposed Lie of Mohammed (ib. May, 1849); and the third a discussion of the question whether Mohammed could read and write (Proceedings of the Congress of Orientalists at Florence, i. 357). To these must be added Biblische Legenden der Mohammedaner (Frankfurt, 1845), in which Weil argues the influence of the rabbinic legends upon the religion of Islam. The most comprehensive work of Weil is his Geschichte der Chalifen (5 vols., Heidelberg and Stuttgart, 1846‚Äì51), which is virtually an elaboration of the original works of Muslim historians, whom he in large part studied from manuscripts; it treats also of the Egyptian and Spanish califates. This was followed by the Geschichte der Islamischen V√∂lker von Mohammed bis zur Zeit des Sultans Selim. (Stuttgart, 1866), an introduction to the medieval history of the Orient. After 1866 Weil confined his literary activity to the publication of reviews in the Heidelberger Jahrb√ºcher and in the Jenaische Litteratur-Zeitung. In later years he received honors from various states, including Baden and Prussia. Owing to continued illness he was pensioned in 1888. Weil died at Freiburg-im- Breisgau in 1889. His collection of Arabic manuscripts was presented to the University of Heidelberg by his children.

It only was known to science as an extant bird for a very short time in the early 19th century. There is some disagreement about its area of occurrence: Although there were claims that the bird was also found in the area of Fito and Maroantsetra as well as near Toamasina (Tamatave), i.e., the coastal areas of northern Toamasina Province, all specimens with good locality data are from the offshore island of Nosy Boraha. As the vernacular name implies, land snails were a favored food item of this species. Extinction Chromolithic print Of the 14 specimens that exist nowadays, all but two are known to have taken between 1827 and 1834, many by the surgeon and naturalist Chevalier Joseph Alphonse Bernier. The Paris type specimen was in the collection of the Mus√©um national d'Histoire naturelle before that date, and one specimen may have been taken as late as 1850. As this species - the second-largest coua extant in modern times - was very spectacular, it was much sought after as a museum piece. However, it probably was restricted to coastal rainforest on Nosy Boraha, and its habitat was largely destroyed by deforestation in the course of the 19th century. Introduction of black rats may also have contributed to its demise, probably less by direct predation than by competition for food, but there probably was a thriving rat population on Nosy Boraha as soon as 1700, considering that the island was a favorite place for pirates to overhaul. Cats, which would have preyed on the bird, were probably introduced only in the 19th century and make a more likely candidate for an introduced species that had a negative impact on Delalande's coua. There are some reports that the locals on the adjacent mainland were still occasionally hunting this bird for its decorative plumage in the 1920s, but these seem in error, these records probably referring to the blue coua. What is known with certainty is that in 1932, large sums were offered to well- connected animal dealers in Antananarivo for specimens of Delalande's coua, but they were unable to procure any. The color pattern of the species is unique among couas, which may be a hint that it evolved in fact in the isolation of Nosy Boraha and never occurred anywhere else. Specimens from \\"Tamatave\\" probably just indicate their port of shipment or the location of the animal dealer who procured them.

England (2009). UAE to safeguard jobs of nationals. Financial Times. London In the UAE workplace, much better treatment is afforded to Emiratis than immigrants.

However, unemployment is rising and in Abu Dhabi as many as 11.6 percent of Emiratis are unemployed. While there is general agreement over the importance of Emiratisation for social, economic and political reasons, there is also some contention as to the impact of localization on organizational efficiency. It is yet unknown whether, and the extent to which, employment of nationals generates returns for MNEs operating in the Middle East. Recent research cautions that localization is not always advantageous for firms operating in the region, and its effectiveness depends on a number of contingent factors.Mellahi, K. (2007).

Its sister theaters were the Apollo in Harlem, the Howard Theatre in Washington, D.C., the Regal Theatre in Chicago, and the Earl Theater in Philadelphia. All of the biggest stars in black entertainment, including those in jazz and blues such as Cab Calloway, performed at the Royal.

It consists of factory-made components or units that are transported and assembled on-site to form the complete building.

Buildings have been built in one place and reassembled in another throughout history. This was especially true for mobile activities, or for new settlements; one of the first buildings at Cape Ann in 1624 was probably partially prefabricated, and was rapidly disassembled and moved at least once. John Rollo described in 1801 earlier use of portable hospital buildings in the West Indies Possibly the first advertised prefab house was the \\"Manning cottage\\". A London carpenter, Henry Manning, constructed a house that was built in components, then shipped and assembled by British emigrants. This was published at the time (advertisement, South Australian Record, 1837) and a few still stand in Australia.Prefab: From Utilitarian Home To Design Icon, by Jim Zarroli, Morning Edition, September 15, 2008, NPR One such is the Friends Meeting House, Adelaide.Channel 9 South Australia Pty Ltd > Postcards > Friend's Meeting House Retrieved 8 September 2011 This reference has a contemporary sketch and recent photograph of the Friends' Meeting House The peak year for the importation of portable buildings to Australia was 1853, when several hundred arrived. These have been identified as coming from Liverpool, Boston and Singapore (with Chinese instructions for re-assembly). In Barbados the Chattel house was a form of prefabricated building which was developed by emancipated slaves who had limited rights to build upon land they did not own. As the buildings were moveable they were legally regarded as chattels. In 1855 during the Crimean War, after Florence Nightingale wrote a letter to The Times, Isambard Kingdom Brunel was commissioned to design a prefabricated modular hospital. In five months he designed the Renkioi Hospital: a 1,000 patient hospital, with innovations in sanitation, ventilation and a flushing toilet.Renkioi: Brunel's Forgotten Crimean War Hospital by Christopher Silver Fabricator William Eassie constructed the required 16 units in Gloucester Docks, shipped directly to the Dardanelles. Only used from March 1856 to September 1857, it reduced the death rate from 42% to 3.5%. The world's first prefabricated, pre-cast panelled apartment blocks were pioneered in Liverpool. A process was invented by city engineer John Alexander Brodie, whose inventive genius also had him inventing the football goal net. The tram stables at Walton in Liverpool followed in 1906. The idea was not extensively adopted in Britain, however was widely adopted elsewhere, particularly in Eastern Europe. Prefabricated homes were produced during the Gold Rush in the United States, when kits were produced to enable Californian prospectors to quickly construct accommodation. Homes were available in kit form by mail order in the United States in 1908. Prefabricated housing was popular during the Second World War due to the need for mass accommodation for military personnel. The United States used Quonset huts as military buildings, and in the United Kingdom prefabricated buildings used included Nissen huts and Bellman Hangars. 'Prefabs' were built after the war as a means of quickly and cheaply providing quality housing as a replacement for the housing destroyed during the Blitz. The proliferation of prefabricated housing across the country was a result of the Burt Committee and the Housing (Temporary Accommodation) Act 1944. Under the Ministry of Works Emergency Factory Made housing programme, a specification was drawn up and bid on by various private construction and manufacturing companies. After approval by the MoW, companies could bid on Council led development schemes, resulting in whole estates of prefabs constructed to provide accommodation for those made homeless by the War and ongoing slum clearance. Almost 160,000 had been built in the UK by 1948 at a cost of close to ¬£216 million. The largest single prefab estate in BritainBelle Vale, Liverpool was at Belle Vale (South Liverpool), where more than 1,100 were built after World War 2. The estate was demolished in the 1960s amid much controversy as the prefabs were very popular with residents at the time. Amersham Prefab (COAM)-front room showing solid-fuel fire Prefabs were aimed at families, and typically had an entrance hall, two bedrooms (parents and children), a bathroom (a room with a bath) ‚Äî which was a novel innovation for many Britons at that time, a separate toilet, a living room and an equipped (not fitted in the modern sense) kitchen. Construction materials included steel, aluminium, timber or asbestos, depending on the type of dwelling. The aluminium Type B2 prefab was produced as four pre-assembled sections which could be transported by lorry anywhere in the country. Amersham Prefab's Kitchen (COAM)-showing Belling cooker, Ascot wash heater and fridge The Universal House (pictured left & lounge diner right) was given to the Chiltern Open Air Museum after 40 years temporary use. The Mark 3 was manufactured by the Universal Housing Company Ltd, Rickmansworth. The United States used prefabricated housing for troops during the war and for GIs returning home. Prefab classrooms were popular with UK schools increasing their rolls during the baby boom of the 1950s and 1960s. Many buildings were designed with a five-ten year life span, but have far exceeded this, with a number surviving today. In 2002, for example, the city of Bristol still had residents living in 700 examples. Many UK councils have been in the process of demolishing the last surviving examples of Second World War prefabs in order to comply with the British government's Decent Homes Standard, which came into effect in 2010. There has, however, been a recent revival in prefabricated methods of construction in order to compensate for the United Kingdom's current housing shortage. Prefabs and the modernist movement Architects are incorporating modern designs into the prefabricated houses of today. Prefab housing should no longer be compared to a mobile home in terms of appearance, but to that of a complex modernist design. There has also been an increase in the use of \\"green\\" materials in the construction of these prefab houses. Consumers can easily select between different environmentally friendly finishes and wall systems. Since these homes are built in parts, it is easy for a home owner to add additional rooms or even solar panels to the roofs. Many prefab houses can be customized to the client's specific location and climate, making prefab homes much more flexible and modern than before. There is a zeitgeist in architectural circles and the spirit of the age favors the small carbon footprint of \\"prefab.\\" Eminent amongst the new breed of off the shelf luxury modernist products is the perrinepod, which has found favor worldwide for its green credentials and three-day build time. In communist countries A high-rise Plattenbau in Jena, Germany. Many eastern European countries had suffered physical damage during World War II and their economies were in a very poor state. There was a need to reconstruct cities which had been severely damaged due to the war. For example, Warsaw had been practically razed to the ground under the planned destruction of Warsaw by German forces after the 1944 Warsaw Uprising. The centre of Dresden, Germany, had been totally destroyed by the 1945 Allied bombardment. Stalingrad had been largely destroyed and only a small number of structures were left standing. Prefabricated buildings served as an inexpensive and quick way to alleviate the massive housing shortages associated with the wartime destruction and large-scale urbanization and rural flight. Prefabricated commercial buildings Tesco modular store in Zub≈ô√≠, Czech Republic McDonald's uses prefabricated structures for their buildings, and set a record of constructing a building and opening for business within 13 hours (on pre-prepared ground works). In the UK, the major supermarkets have each developed a modular unit system to shop building, based on the systems developed by German cost retailler Aldi and the Danish supermarket chain Netto.

Kapauan (July 4, 1931 - October 12, 1996) was a chemist and researcher. He graduated magna cum laude from University of the Philippines, Diliman in 1952, with a bachelor's degree in chemistry. He obtained his doctorate from the University of Southern California in 1959. In the Ateneo de Manila University Department of Chemistry, he worked on inorganic and physical chemistry, particularly on radioactive bromine. With other colleagues, he initiated investigations in the 1970s on heavy metals analysis in our environment. He was among the first to look into the problem of mercury in the environment, and he designed the appropriate equipment for mercury analysis in water, fish and soil. Kapauan linked with international groups, taught one of the first environmental chemistry courses in the country, and involved himself in policies on urban-rural planning. He later went into the field of electronics, specifically chemical instrumentation. Together with Fr. William Schmitt, S.J., they pioneered the maintenance, design and modification of instruments. Kapauan's first publication appeared in the Journal of Chemical Education in May 1973. He also started to interface traditional instruments with the increasingly popular PC. By the 1980s, his students were designing software for them, including Fourier Transform of signals. He redesigned a spectrophotometer with vacuum-tube technology into one with solid-state technology, run by a PC with software written by his students. He designed and built new electrochemical systems, which merited publications in Analytical Chemistry (the leading journal of analytical chemistry worldwide). This was an honor considering that these were the few, if not the only, international publications done by one Filipino, entirely in the Philippines. He continued to find applications for these electrochemical systems, dreaming that they might be distributed to data stations all over the country for trace analysis of metals and for mapping of water quality. He was one of the founders of the Philippine Institute of Pure and Applied Chemistry, and one of the architects of the Ph.D. program of the UP-Ateneo-DLSU Chemistry Consortium. He moved into environmental concerns and microelectronics in the infant stages of their applications in chemistry. He wrote a college textbook, ‚ÄúGeneral Chemistry,‚Äù with Amando Clemente and Antonio I. de Leon. He made ‚ÄúCardboard Orbital Domain Models‚Äù and published this in Journal of Chemical Education in August 1966. His 1967 Unesco stint in Thailand brought together a series of innovative experiments for ‚Äúlab-less‚Äù high schools, which was eventually published as a book, ‚ÄúCreative Chemistry.‚Äù Kapauan replaced expensive equipment with materials he bought from the grocery, hardware, photo supply and the drugstore. He taught his students to do audio-visuals, including 8-mm animated films, molecular models, and computer-aided instruction. Kapauan died on October 12, 1996.

As the 12th-largest human services charity in the United States, Christian Appalachian Project (CAP) served over 36,000 eastern Kentuckians in the last fiscal year. In addition, CAP's gift in kind program called Operation Sharing, provided assistance in all thirteen Appalachian states, reaching over 1 million people. Following its faith-based principles, CAP is helped by donors, volunteers, staff and the community to provide a variety of programs that have proven successful in helping people help themselves. CAP concerns stewardship and innovation. Operation Sharing is CAP's farthest-reaching mission, giving away over $100 million in gift-in-kind donations to more than 1,400 partner agencies and churches in Appalachia in 2010. CAP receives donations from corporations and individuals and uses the goods to offset costs of its human services missions, to give to other charities and to give to victims of natural disasters. Through Operation Relief, a component of Operation Sharing, CAP gives millions of dollars' worth of emergency supplies to those devastated by tornadoes, floods, hurricanes and other natural disasters. CAP's disaster services also supplies teams of relief workers who assist victims with physical labor involved in recovering from disasters.

Most were developed by Chunsoft (later Spike Chunsoft), and select games were developed by other companies with Chunsoft's permission. The series began when co‚Äìcreator of Dragon Quest, Koichi Nakamura, was inspired by a fellow developer's experience with Rogue and a desire to create an original series. It began on the Super Famicom, progressing to almost all of Nintendo's and Sony's home and handheld consoles, WonderSwan, Dreamcast, Windows, and mobile devices. The series has inspired other entries in Japan and has moderate popularity, mostly with the Torneko's Great Adventure and crossover entries with the Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon series, and lesser with the Chocobo games based on the creatures from the Final Fantasy series. Games Although all games in the series bear the Fushigi no Dungeon moniker somewhere in their Japanese titles, only the Shiren the Wanderer games contain original characters; all other license their characters from other role-playing game franchises. The first game, Torneko no Daib≈çken: Fushigi no Dungeon stars Torneko, a shopkeeper character from the same developer's Dragon Quest IV. Mystery Dungeon games are among the few console games in the roguelike genre. Chunsoft has also started several lines of branded Mystery Dungeon games. One features the Chocobo from the Final Fantasy series, then Gundam, TwinBee, Tower of Druaga, Pok√©mon, Etrian Odyssey, and One Way Heroics is the latest crossover as of 2015. Other games who are not developed or published by the company but uses the same moniker would also appear throughout the years, namely the Touhou Project series with its spin-offs titled Fushigi no Gensokyo. =Spin-offs= The franchise had its first spin-off game in 2004 titled Shiren Monsters: Netsal. It is only one game based on the monsters from the Shiren the Wanderer series. Gameplay Most Mystery Dungeon games center around exploring a dungeon with randomly generated layouts and fights. These are in a turn-based manner, where the player's every action such as attacking or walking, is met by the opponents' action. Chunsoft described the gameplay as being like chess. Escape from the dungeon is usually only allowed in certain places, or through the use of certain items. When the player loses the game, the player loses all money and half the items in the more forgiving variants, or loses everything and has to start from scratch in others. An effort has also been made to expand the series' gameplay features, such as adding job systems to some games, and giving each dungeon a different feel and goal. Features distinct to the Shiren the Wanderer series include the \\"Melding Jar\\" which allows players to synthesize items and weapons into more powerful ones. The Chocobo games further simplify the genre's difficulty to appeal to a wider and younger audience. Development Koichi Nakamura, founder of Chunsoft and co-creator of the Dragon Quest series, conceived the series as Chunsoft's first original work. After the launch of the Super Famicom, they ceased working on the Dragon Quest series and began working on the Mystery Dungeon series. The series was based on the game Rogue, which has spawned its own genre called roguelike. For a week Nakamura played Rogue at the recommendation of a staff member, trying to understand the game's appeal, and concluded the high degree of challenge made the game very rewarding. Nakamura explained that the appeal of the Mystery Dungeon series is that every game is different and that players skills are constantly being challenged, which helps the player feel deeply involved. Seiichiro Nagahata, who supervised and planned the development of Shiren the Wanderer DS, explained that the Mystery Dungeon series is all about \\"tension\\" and \\"reasoning\\". =Music= Though the franchise is divided with numerous crossovers, the majority of its soundtracks were composed by Koichi Sugiyama and Hayato Matsuo for the Dragon Quest crossovers and Shiren the Wanderer series. Other composers such as Yuzo Koshiro for the Etrian Odyssey crossover or Keisuke Ito and Arata Iiyoshi for the Pok√©mon crossover have frequently contributed in the franchise. Reception The Shiren the Wanderer series has generally favorable ratings in Japan and throughout the world. Famitsu awarded a 36/40 to Demon Invasion! Shiren Castle! and a 38/40 to the original release of Magic Castle of the Desert, the highest score the publication had given to a Game Boy Color game. The series has been both praised and criticized for its difficulty, and generally noted for the uneven quality of the randomly generated levels, or \\"floors\\", the games produce. =Sales= , a grand total of 21.06 million copies across the franchise have been sold, the majority of which are in the Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon series. The Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon series is known to have high sale rates among the franchise, surpassing one millon copies for most of its games like Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team and its remake Rescue Team DX, and Explorers of Time, Darkness and Sky alone. Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon: Gates to Infinity was the 18th best selling game in Japan in 2012, with more than 373,000 copies sold. The Chocobo series is thought to have had middling success, with strong launch sales but not a huge popular response.

In 1092, the castle fell into the occupation of the Almoravid dynasty who were expelled in an uprising that took place in 1145. During this uprising, the castle was besieged by the Governor of Valencia, Marwan Abd-al-Aziz. In 1171, the Castle finally fell, along with the rest of the Levante coast, into the hands of the Almohads. King James I of Aragon began his crusade there in the summer of 1239, finally capturing X√°tiva on 22 May 1244, following a five-month siege. After submitting to the Christian monarch and signing the Treaty of X√†tiva the Moors handed over the smaller nearby Castle to James I, while they were allowed to continue occupying the larger castle for another two years based on the terms of the treaty. After the two years had elapsed King James I of Aragon repopulated a large part of the town with Catalan and Aragonese settlers.

L√©vy was born in Ribeauvill√© in Alsace. Educated at the √âcole Polytechnique, where he was a student of Adh√©mar Jean Claude Barr√© de Saint-Venant,Osakada K., p.24 and the √âcole des Ponts et Chauss√©es, he became an engineer in 1863. During the Franco-Prussian War (1870‚Äì1871), he was entrusted by the Government of National Defense with the control of part of the artillery. During the next decade he held several educational positions, becoming professor at the √âcole Centrale in 1875, member of the commission of the geodetic survey of France in 1879, and professor at the Coll√®ge de France in 1885. Total strain theory L√©vy changed the assumption, \\"the directions of principal strains coincide with those of the principal stresses\\", stated by Saint-Venant, to \\"the directions of increments of principal strains coincide with those of the principal stresses\\" and that was also the first attempt of using an incremental flow rule. In 1888 L√©vy inaugurated a system of boat-traction by means of overhead cables. A trial system was installed between Joinville-le- Pont and Saint-Maurice; it consisted of an endless cable which was kept in motion by powerful steam-engines and to which boats were attached and thus kept at a speed of four kilometers an hour. The system proved unsatisfactory, however.  Selected works  L√©vy is the author of several works, including: * \\"La Statique Graphique et Ses Applications √† l'Art des Constructions\\" (1874; 2d ed. 1887); * \\"Sur le Principe d'√ânergie\\" (1888); * \\"√âtude des Moyens de Traction des Bateaux: Le Halage Funiculaire\\" (with M.

LBCI was founded in 1992 by acquiring the assets, liabilities and logo of LBC, an entity founded in 1985 during the Lebanese Civil War by the Lebanese Forces militia. LBCI went global in 1996 when it launched its satellite channel LBC Al-Fadha'iya Al-Lubnaniya () covering Lebanon, the Arab world, Europe, America, Australia and Africa. History =Post-war era= The Lebanese Forces, a lebanese resistance that had founded LBC in 1985, was militarily and financially weakened by Lebanese civil war which ended in 1990 and its leader Samir Geagea was imprisoned in 1994. In 1992 Pierre El Daher had founded LBCI along with other shareholders and registered it at the Commercial Register of Baabda. In the current ownership battle over the channel, El Daher has failed to prove that the Lebanese Forces sold the original LBC channel to him allowing him to move its assets to the newly created LBCI. In April 1996, El Daher and other shareholders launched LBCsat, a free satellite channel. The new channel was a success, especially to the Lebanese diaspora, disseminated throughout the world. In 2003, as a result of an agreement between Saleh Kamel, founder of LMH company (Lebanese Media Holding, owner of 49% of LBC SAT and Pac's shares) and Saudi prince Al Waleed bin Talal, the latter, through Kingdom, replaced Kamel in LMH. By the end of 2008, it was decided to increase the capital of LMH considerably. Accordingly, Al-Waleed Bin Talal became the largest shareholder after acquiring the absolute majority in PAC (a content provider for both LBCI and LBC SAT) and LBC SAT, based on an understanding that the capital increase would be invested to improve the programs‚Äô network and upgrade productivity under the supervision of Sheikh Pierre Daher. In 2010, Rupert Murdoch joined the group and PAC and LBC SAT were merged with Rotana. Rumor was that this merger would improve and develop the group, which seemed an obvious result of the cooperation between the Saudi prince and the owner of the biggest media empire in the world, Rupert Murdoch. These expectations did not materialize. =Al Hayat and LBC SAT merger= At the end of the year 2002, LBC SAT and the London-based Al Hayat newspaper owned by Saudis, merged their news programs. LBC SAT daily news bulletin was called the \\"Al Hayat-LBC SAT news bulletin\\". The cooperation ended in 2010. =LBCI ownership battle= The Lebanese Forces, a local political party initiated proceedings in Lebanon claiming ownership of LBCI, and lost miserably, because of the flaws and political influence over the judiciary system. As stated above, pierre daher failed to show evidence that he owns the original LBC TV.

In December 2019, LBCI announced that the LDC brand will be discontinued by the beginning of the year 2020 and that all programs will be broadcast via LBCI. The main reason behind the decision is that the LDC branding is no longer needed since the battle for the LBC brand and channels with Al Walid Bin Talal has been resolved and won by LBCI current owner, Pierre El Daher. =Logos= File:LBCI DRAMA.jpg.pngLBCI Drama logo File:LBCI News logo.pngLBCI News logo File:LBCI HD logo.pngLBCI HD logo File:LDC logo new.pngLDC logo File:EUROPE FINAL.pngLBC Europe logo File:Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation America (logo).pngLBC America logo File:LBC Australia.pngLBC Australia logo Popular programs LBCI has produced many popular shows including: Little Big Stars ŸÜÿ¨ŸàŸÖ ÿµÿ∫ÿßÿ±, Star Academy Arab World, Ya Katel Ya Maktoul (Arabic version of Greed), Miss Lebanon, Hellha wo Ehtalha (Arabic version of French TV Show Fort Boyard), Survivor Middle East, El Wadi (Arabic version of The Farm), The Perfect Bride and Mission Fashion.

Designed by New Zealand Government Railways' (NZR) Chief Mechanical Engineer A. L. Beattie and ordered from the Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1901, they were the first locomotives in the world to be built with the wheel arrangement of 4-6-2. This wheel arrangement came to be known as the Pacific type after the voyage the completed locomotives had to make across the Pacific Ocean to New Zealand. A few instances of the 4-6-2 wheel arrangement are known to have existed prior to 1901, but these were all reconstructions of locomotives that were originally built with a different wheel arrangement, thereby making the thirteen members of the Q class the first \\"true\\" Pacifics in the world. The Pacific style went on to become arguably the most famous wheel arrangement in the world. Design The Q class's design stems from the requirement for a locomotive similar to the UB class with the inclusion of a wide firebox to burn poor quality lignite coal from the South Island and the Waikato. Originally plans to equip the new locomotives with a Wootten Firebox would have seen the \\"Camelback\\" configuration adopted. Operation In operation, the locomotives proved to be satisfactory rather than brilliant and they suffered from occasional gear problems. They were soon displaced from the most important and difficult work by members of the A and AB classes; in fact, later in life, they were re-boilered with AB boilers. An improved slightly larger 'Q' type was ordered from Baldwins in 1914 but classified AA due to their dimensions similar to the A class. In a 1902 trial of various locomotives between Invercargill and Gore the Q class with large fire-grate area \\"gave the most efficient results\\" of the larger locomotives. Withdrawal They saw out their final years working in Otago and the West Coast and the last Q class locomotive was retired in 1957. No examples of the class were preserved.

A second version aired daily on the BET cable network from September 14, 1992 to September 17, 1993. The original version was hosted by Jim Lange (his last game show hosted job) and sub-hosted by Alan Hunter. Spencer Christian hosted the BET version. The original series was produced at the Aquarius Theater in Hollywood, while the 1990s run of the show was taped at NBA Entertainment Studios in Secaucus, New Jersey. The announcers were Sam Riddle on the 1988 version (who was also a producer for the show) and John Walker on the 1992 version. The original pilot was taped in 1987 and was hosted by Sam Riddle, with Johnny Gilbert serving as announcer. Ben Vereen and his daughter (not long before her fatal car accident) and Scott Baio and his mother were the celebrity duos. Syndicated version =Main game= Two teams of three played, each consisting of a civilian contestant, a celebrity guest, and one of the celebrity's relatives. In all rounds, a song and/or music video was played, and three toss-up questions connected to the song were asked. Each question had four possible answers which were revealed one at a time. A player could buzz in with a guess at any time, as long as at least one answer had been revealed. A correct answer scored money for the team. An incorrect answer lost money, at which point the opposing team could take a chance to answer as the remaining answers were revealed. A team also lost money for buzzing in before at least one answer was revealed; if this happened, all four answers were immediately revealed and the opposing team was given a chance to answer. Rounds 1 and 2 In the first two rounds, one player from each team representing his or her own generation faced off against each other. For the first round, the songs played came from their own generation and were worth $50 each, while in round two the songs came from another generation and were worth $100 each. Three songs were played in each round, one song per pair of players. Round 3 (Free for All) The final round of the game was the \\"Free for All\\" round, so called because all six players were equipped with their own buzzers and could buzz in on every question. A series of songs were played within a set time limit, with each correct answer being worth $200. When time expired, the team with the most money won the game and advanced to the \\"Triple Threat Relay Round\\". If the game ended in a tie one final question was played. The team that buzzed in with the correct answer won the game; if they were wrong, their opponents automatically won, but they still got a free guess. =Triple Threat Relay Round= The Triple Threat Relay Round was a bonus round played just like a relay race. Three artists were displayed on the game board, with each having three spaces below their names. Additionally, at either end of the board were two blank areas, also with three spaces each, and these served as \\"Out of Play\\" areas. One at a time, each team member was handed a card with a song title on it by Lange. They would then walk over to the board and place the card either under one of the artists' names or in the Out of Play area. This continued for 60 seconds. Each correct title paid off at $100, and once the team correctly identified all three song titles for a respective artist a series of chasing lights above the column lit up. If all nine titles were placed correctly before time ran out, the civilian player would win three times what the team had earned in the main game. On the episodes hosted by Alan Hunter, the players would have to match movies to actors appearing in them. BET version Gameplay was basically the same as the original version; however, a few changes were made to the format. Instead of having celebrity guests on the teams, civilian families of three competed. In addition, the game was played for points instead of cash, with prizes awarded in the Relay Round, and the winning family returned as champion to compete on the next show. Having aired on BET, this version focused more on Black-oriented music, TV shows, and movies. =Main game= One member of each family played per song. Correct answers added points (5 in the first round, and 10 in the second), while incorrect answers lost points and gave the opposing team to answer from the remaining choices. Using the same rules as the Lange version, all family members competed in the \\"Free for All\\" round, with each correct answer being worth 20 points. At the end of the round, the family in the lead won a prize package and advanced to the Triple Threat Relay Round. =Triple Threat Relay Round= Aside from cosmetic changes to the board, the Relay Round was played the same as in the original version. Correctly guessing all nine songs for all three artists won a trip to both Disneyland in Anaheim, California and Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida; after doing so, the winning team would retire as champions. On some episodes, players had to match movies to actors appearing in them. =Tournament of Champions= During the last week of this version, a Tournament of Champions was held; the winners won a trip to the Euro Disney Resort (now Disneyland Resort Paris), while the second place family won a trip to Walt Disney World.

According to Maltese linguist Mario Cassar, the surname is of Arabic origin, and derives from the Muslim period of Malta. there are also various other proposed origins of the surname.: * It may be traced back to the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, incorporating the island of Sicily itself, the area around Naples, and the southern part of the Italian peninsula. The surname Cassar may have derived from the given name \\"Cesare,\\" and further back from the Roman family name \\"Caesar.\\" In Classical antiquity, the name \\"Caesar\\" was associated by folk etymology with the Latin word \\"caesaries\\" (meaning head of hair). The Maltese Cassar coat of arms has the Latin word \\"SPES\\" (meaning \\"hope\\") inscribed on it. * It may also derive from a fairly common surname in Italy and Sicily: Cassara, or Cassarino, possibly from a nickname \\"cassaio\\" meaning \\"producer of cases\\". However these surnames may also be derived from the given name \\"Cesare\\" or \\"Caesar\\". The most important representatives of the family are the Cassar Desain, marchese de Sain in Malta and the Cassar Torregiani, one of the richest family in the 19th century in Malta.

Retrieved 8 December 2019. In 1950 Ostoja migrated to Australia, arriving in Melbourne where he supported himself with work as a labourer. He enrolled at the Victorian School of Fine Arts National Gallery School under Alan Sumner and William Dargie 1950-1955 and there introduced the new abstract expression of Europe both to lecturers and students. He settled in the Adelaide Hills, South Australia, on the Booth estate at Stirling, living under the patronage of the Booth family for over 40 years (Freya Booth, the wife of Edward Stirling Booth, was a daughter of the artist Sir Hans HeysenAnna Stirling Pope (2000): Mrs Freya Booth Geni.com Retrieved 8 December 2019.). His first one-man exhibition was also in South Australia at the Royal Society of Arts, Adelaide. In 1956 Ostoja met and collaborated with Ian Davidson in the production of the short film Five South Australian Artists, and became involved in stage and theatre set design. He co-produced several experimental films again with Ian Davidson, including The Quest of Time in 1957 Ostoja's work in abstract expression began to receive accolades. He won the Cornell Prize for the canvas Form in Landscape. He started to design sets for theatre and dance including for Six Characters in Search of an Author by Luigi Pirandello (1957); the South Australian production of Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot (1958); Gaetano Donizetti's Elixir of Love, with novel light settings and modulations, for the Elder Conservatorium of the University of Adelaide which used his techniques for their Opera Workshops (1959); for The Egg; and for two performances of the South Australian Ballet Theatre with light/colour abstract presentations (1959). 1960 This year he designed sets for a new opera group which would eventually grow into the South Australian Opera Company. Among other theatrical events, he designed and executed the scenery for Moon on a Rainbow Shawl by Errol John, and The Teahouse of the August Moon by John Patrick, (a production by the University of Adelaide Theatre Guild). He received artistic satisfaction but little financial reward for these efforts. In this year also, he staged a visual production on the theme of Orpheus, using dance, music and voice with several projectors. This was the first attempt at quadraphonic sound in Australia, and also the first demonstration of \\"Chromasonics\\" - the science of translating sound into visual images. Ostoja then designed innovative \\"abstracted\\" scenery for a production of The Marriage of Figaro and Benjamin Britten's The Turn of the Screw. 1961 Ostoja designed the sets for the controversial South Australian production of Patrick White's Ham Funeral - also Alan Seymour's Swamp Creatures, both performed by the University of Adelaide Theatre Guild. He designed and constructed six stained glass windows for the Refectory at the University of Adelaide. In this period Ostoja designed special lights and gauzes for difficult effects required in an ambitious production of the opera Don Carlos by the Opera Workshop, for the Elder Conservatorium. 1962 Ostoja designed and built sets for the production of J.S, by Archibald MacLeish, for the second Adelaide Festival of Arts. He exhibited vitreous enamel works in Melbourne's Argus Gallery. Max Harris, in The Bulletin of 20 October 1962, praised Ostoja's sets for My Cousin from Fiji in Union Theatre, Adelaide, and his technique of rear screen projections as later adopted throughout Australia. 1963 Ostoja continued to develop Multi- Image projections, demonstrating for the first time in Australia the concept later to be known as 'audio-visuals!'. Ostoja gave Sir Herbert Read, the art critic, a personal viewing of one of his visual presentations. At Christmas, in the Elder Conservatorium, Ostoja gave what was probably the world's first \\"visual concert\\", using special projectors and incorporating music, colours and shapes. 1964 Ostoja co-designed a dance and stage production in Adelaide. For the Adelaide Festival of Arts of that year, he designed the largest light mosaic ever staged up to that time, upon the facade of an 11-storey building. Ostoja was invited to New Zealand, and exhibited the first electronically generated images in Australia in Melbourne, at the Argus Gallery. His design for the bas-relief mural for the new B.P. building in Melbourne'Adelaide may win contest for mural,' in The Age, Tuesday 24 Dec 1963, p.10 was the subject of a film which won the \\"Blue Ribbon\\" Award in the American Film Festival in New York. 1965 Ostoja designed and made the first light kinetic mural in Australia, and continued to evolve theatrical works using multi-screen and Multi-projector techniques. The Production of Jean Genet's The Balcony was very controversial. with Elizabeth Dalman, Ostoja produced new dance forms for Melbourne Television. He introduced Op Art to Australia, both at South Yarra Gallery in Melbourne, and Gallery A in Sydney. 1966 With John Dallwitz, Ostoja was invited to present more \\"Sound and Image\\" experimental theatre. he incorporated Australian poetry into the sound, music, and visual images. The architect Robin Boyd commissioned Ostoja to design two large Op murals for the Australian Pavilion entrance at the Expo 67. Ostoja was awarded a Churchill Fellowship, which enabled him to have extensive world travel, comparing art and technology in many countries. He began to work with language, contemporary poetry and prose, and computers. 1967 In Berne, Switzerland, Ostoja received the \\"Excellence F.I.A.P.\\" Award for innovative photography. 1968 At the Adelaide Festival of Arts, Ostoja staged the first combined \\"Sound and Image\\" production in the world using a laser beam. This included the first science fiction play (by Ray Bradbury) performed in Australia. Ostoja's theatre methods were increasingly attracting the attention of critics to how plays were staged. \\"Chromasonics\\", developed and introduced by Ostoja, was now being used extensively in the entertainment industry. 1969 Ostoja staged Krzysztof Penderecki's St. Luke Passion, a controversial, contemporary religious work. The South Australian The Advertiser wrote an extensive critique of Ostoja's work. Robin Boyd commissioned Ostoja to build a \\"chromasonic\\" exhibit for the Expo '70 in Osaka. 1970 Ostoja presented an Australian Aboriginal Dreamtime theme in his \\"Sound and Image\\" theatre, working with leading contemporary figures in poetry, music and dance. This was the first production of its kind in Australia, and appeared after the Festival in Melbourne, Sydney, Canberra and Perth. Ostoja's Space Scape mural, sixty feet long by ten feet high, won the Australia-wide competition for a mural for Adelaide Airport. His high 'light and sound' structure for the Adelaide Festival was the first of its kind in the world. 1971 Ostoja awarded a Creative Arts Fellowship at the Australian National University, Canberra. His 18-month stay resulted in the design and building of a \\"Chromasonics unit-laser\\", a Chromasonic tower, and a world premiere of a Synchronos concert. 1972 With Don Burrows and Don Banks, Ostoja presented Synchronos 72, where one could \\"hear the colours and see the sounds\\". Ostoja added Cymatics, developed during the Fellowship, to his workshop repertoire. He was invited to exhibit his photography in the National Gallery, Melbourne. 1973 Ostoja received a Fellowship from the Australian American Education Association to study art and technology in the U.S.A. He studied laser art and technology, using a newly developed material in his optical collages. 1974 Using several lasers, Ostoja designed sets and a special curtain for the complex work The Excursions of Mr. Brouƒçek by Jan√°ƒçek, the first opera produced at the new Adelaide Festival Theatre complex. 1975 The artist's Laser - Chromasonics (1972) and Laser Chromasonic Tower Mark III exhibited for the Festival of Creative Art and Sciences, Canberra. Ostoja commissioned to design a vitreous enamel mural for the Earth Science building, University of Melbourne. 1976 Ostoja exhibited works in vitreous enamel on steel, optical collages, and for the first time in Australia, collages incorporating Kirlian photography. The Premier, Don Dunstan, opened this exhibition at Lidum's Gallery, Adelaide. Ostoja's Theremin 74, using electronics and stainless steel, purchased by the Tasmanian Art Gallery. Ostoja commissioned to produce a large bass relief mural for the new Nauru House, in Melbourne. 1977 Ostoja displayed exhibits of vitreous enamels, optical collages, and kinetics with six lasers at the Australian Galleries Exhibition in Melbourne. He was commissioned to undertake a feasibility study for a solar mural by the University of Melbourne. 1978 The artist's computer poem Tidal Element (the first computer poem composed in Australia) featured in a special issue of \\"Australian Literary Studies\\" (Adelaide University). Ostoja created a new Laser Chromasonic Tower, which produced kinetic laser images and incandescent lights, for the Royal Adelaide International Expo 78. Ostoja's experiments with an argon laser gave rise to a new organic image in his work laser images, including \\"Astroid\\" and \\"Harmonics\\". 1980 The Australian Broadcasting Corporation produced a half-hour documentary on Ostoja's work, the program screening on 13 April 1980. The Governor-General and his wife visited the artist's studio in Stirling. Christopher Hunt, Artistic Director of the 1980 Adelaide Festival of Arts, invited Ostoja to exhibit his laser kinetics in conjunction with a holographic exhibit from the New York Museum. The show, Futuresight, in the Melville Hall, Adelaide, was opened by Sir Mark Oliphant. The magazine Scientific Australian published an article on this exhibition in the No.4, Volume 4 Edition. 1981‚Äì1982 Ostoja prepared for an exhibition in Sydney, and became interested artistically in Australian jade. Commissioned by Dr Nina Christensen of Melbourne University to construct a jade window. At this Adelaide Festival of Arts he presented a different kind of laser concert. Art in Australia, Vol. 19, No. 3 published an extensive article on Ostoja's works, covering a twenty-year period. 1983 Barry Jones opened Ostoja's two major exhibitions at the Barry Stern Gallery, Sydney - one on optical collages, and a laser kinetics, music and sound exhibition. It is suggested that Ostoja donate his large, personal collection of photographs and a full documentation of his career, to Melbourne University's Australian Collection. The collection was subsequently deposited in the Baillieu Library. 1984 Ostoja used a vapour laser, then built by Quentron Optics in Adelaide. He presented a laser kinetics concert for the Ballarat Festival. 1985 Using computer generated images, Ostoja staged a laser concert at Wayville Showgrounds, Adelaide, to celebrate the finale of the inaugural Adelaide Grand Prix. Australia Post produced a stamp issue designed by Ostoja (using a laser), to launch the first Australian \\"electronic mail\\" system. 1986 Ostoja invited to stage a laser concert for the South Australian Jubilee Celebrations. He constructed the Solaris, a continually changing, solar kinetic mural, at the CSIRO. Division of Applied Physics, Lindfield, N.S.W, and was invited to exhibit it at Expo '88 in Brisbane. 1987 Ostoja redesigned the shape of Solaris for the Brisbane Expo. For the Director of the new Scitech Discovery Centre , Perth, Ostoja designed, produced, and exhibited a work which reveals the effects of theremin and light. 1988 to 1989 Australian Bicentenary celebrations included a project sponsored by the Polish community to honour the name of Australia's highest mountain, Mount Kosciuszko. In collaboration with sculptor John Dowie, Ostoja constructed a geometrical, stainless steel monument at the entrance to the town of Cooma, New South Wales. Reading about chaos theory and Professor Mandelbrot's Beauty of Fractals, Ostoja began to work in this area. An article published in The Australian, October 1989, revealed some of Ostoja's considerable output of work in the field of computer graphics in this new field. 1991-1993 Ostoja was invited by the National Philharmonic in Warsaw, Poland, Ostoja staged SYNKRONOS concert - workshop using 13 blue green and red lasers and incandescent lamps to translate works of traditional and contemporary composers into kinetic laser images and shapes. 1994 Ostoja was involved in part of the 1994 Adelaide Festival's Technilusions. He displayed some of his Fractals and Mandelbrots and was displayed with \\"current\\" and \\"state of the art\\" technologies Animation, Virtual Reality and CD-ROM. He died at home on 2 April 1994 of heat failure, in the cottage Arbroath on the Booth estate at Stirling South Australia, where he had lived under the patronage of the Booth family for over 40 years. His studio was on the same property.

The station is owned by the Miami-Dade County Public Schools and is the area's flagship NPR member station, therefore carries Morning Edition, All Things Considered, Weekend Edition, and Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me!. It is also affiliated with Public Radio International and carries The Takeaway and The World, among others. It airs its own locally-produced music programs Evenin' Jazz with Tracy Fields on weeknights, and Night Train on Sundays, before being taken over by the BBC World Service during the overnights. WLRN first signed on in 1948 as WTHS-FM, on 91.7 MHz. The station later moved to 91.3, changing the calls to WLRN-FM. It was a charter member of NPR in 1970 and is the longest running NPR member in Florida. Its HD2 service was WLRN Xtra HD, \\"South Florida‚Äôs Alternative News and Talk Station\\", featuring talk programming by day and BBC World Service at night. Until December 2, 2007, HD2 carried \\"Classical 24\\", which offered classical music 24 hours per day. Classical 24 has since moved to another public radio station, WKCP 89.7 FM, after that station's acquisition by Classical 24's parent, American Public Media. But 89.7 was sold to K-LOVE on July 17. Classical music has returned to WLRN's HD-2 as of August 10, 2015 under the Classical 24 service once again but is now referred to as WLRN Classical HD2. Employees are part of AFSCME union local 1187 contract. The station also maintains its long-time radio reading service for the blind on an analog subcarrier. The school board also owns WLRN-TV, the secondary PBS member for South Florida on Channel 17. Translators Since the mid-1990s, the station has had five broadcast translator stations, evenly spaced down the Florida Keys. Listed from northeast to southwest, they are: *W228AY 93.5 in Key Largo, Florida (no longer listed) *W221AY 92.1 in Islamorada, Florida *W227AD 93.3 in Key Colony Beach, Florida *W206AS 89.1 on Big Pine Key, Florida *W263BO 100.5 in Key West, Florida These stations do not yet appear to carry HD Radio. In late September 2008, WLRN launched a full-powered, class C3, 12 kW station, WKWM 91.5, in Marathon, Florida, which simulcasts WLRN programming for the southern Keys. This station broadcasts in HD Radio. =101.9, NPR For The Palm Beaches= WLRN-FM also programs W270AD 101.9 in West Palm Beach, Florida, a translator owned by Educational Media Foundation (EMF) and programmed separately as 101.9, NPR For The Palm Beaches; this signal is also simulcast on the HD2 digital signal of EMF's K-Love outlet, WFLV 90.7 FM. On October 16, 2015, it was announced that WLRN-FM would lease the HD2 of WFLV and the translator W270AD from EMF, relaunching Classical South Florida's NPR service for the region, \\"WPBI News\\", as \\"101.9, NPR For The Palm Beaches\\" in November 2015.WLRN To Operate NPR For Palm Beaches - Radio Insight This followed EMF's purchase of WFLV from Classical South Florida who, along with its other outlets WDLV, WMLV and W214BD, was sold to EMF and became affiliates of its K-Love contemporary Christian network.Classical South Florida Flips to K-Love W270AD was programmed as a low-powered and HD2 digital NPR affiliate for the Palm Beaches since Classical South Florida's purchase of then-NPR affiliate WXEL-FM in 2011. Although W270AD's programming is produced by WLRN-FM, it airs a somewhat separate schedule from WLRN-FM's main signal. An example includes that it doesn't air Radyo Lekol (Creole-language program produced by MDCPS; weeknights from 9:00-9:30pm) or Evenin' Jazz with Tracy Fields (weeknights from 9:30pm‚Äì1:00am); BBC World Service airs instead. Controversy 1) In June 2011, WLRN dropped ties with the Florida Public Radio Network, a statewide network of public radio stations designed to provide coverage of the Florida Legislature and other Florida-relevant issues, partly in response to its producer, WFSU-FM in Tallahassee, receiving $2.8 million in funding for various services related to Florida government, including $497,522 for \\"statewide government and cultural affairs programming\\", which includes the Florida Public Radio Network. This is despite the $4.8 million of funding to other public radio and television stations (including WLRN radio and television) vetoed by Governor Rick Scott in May 2011. In its place, WLRN will join the joint partnership between the St. Petersburg Times and The Miami Herald in coverage of state issues from the papers' Tallahassee bureau.

She survived, and thereafter became a symbol of hope for democracy in Chile to many, receiving an embrace and encouragement from Pope John Paul II. Events First testimony of Carmen Gloria Quintana. Collection of the National Archives of Chile. On 2 July 1986, at 8 a.m., she was part of a small group of people preparing a barricade in Los Nogales, part of the district of Estaci√≥n Central in Santiago. That day a national protest was taking place against the military dictatorship of General Pinochet. The group were carrying five used car tyres. They were intercepted by a military patrol that was engaged in demolishing barricades in the area of Avenida General Vel√°squez. All of the group managed to escape except Quintana and Rodrigo Rojas DeNegri, a young photographer. The patrol, under the command of Lieutenant Pedro Fern√°ndez Dittus, was composed of three officers, five non-commissioned officers, and 17 soldiers. There are two versions of the succeeding events: according to the official version of the military patrol as Quintana and Rojas were arrested, some of the molotov cocktails they were carrying broke, setting them on fire accidentally. The opposing version (of Quintana, the only survivor) alleges that both were severely beaten by military personnel, and later soaked with petrol and set on fire. What is clearly known is that after both were aflame and unconscious, patrol members wrapped them in blankets, loaded them into a military vehicle and drove them to an isolated road in the outskirts of Santiago, over 20 kilometres away. There, in an irrigation ditch, they were dumped and left to die. Some agricultural workers found them and notified the police, who then took them to a public hospital. Quintana and Rojas were later transferred to another hospital, but Rojas died from his injuries four days later. Despite the second and third degree burns that Quintana suffered on 62% of her body, with many teeth broken ‚Äì she was in a critical condition for several weeks ‚Äì she finally survived. She was given extensive medical treatment in Chile and in Canada, but still bears disfiguring scars as a result of her burns.Right Click and Save Target to download from the archives of the BBC Witness program (note: slow upload) Aftermath On 3 January 1991, a military tribunal found Fern√°ndez Dittus guilty of negligence for having failed to get medical help for Rojas, but he was cleared of any responsibility for the burning of Quintana. In 1993 the Supreme Court of Chile sentenced Fern√°ndez Dittus to 600 days in prison for his responsibility in the burning death of Rojas DeNegri and the serious burns sustained by Quintana. In October 2000 a court ordered the government to pay Quintana 251.7 million pesos (about US$500,000) in compensatory damages. During the visit to Chile of Pope John Paul II, Carmen Gloria Quintana met the pontiff in Santiago. In July 2015, an ex-soldier of the Chilean army came forward and testified there was a pact of silence in the Chilean military to cover up the immolation of Quintana and Denegri. As a result, a homicide investigation was opened against seven retired members of the Chilean military, all of whom were detained. In March 2019, three retired soldiers were found guilty of murder and attempted murder and sentenced to ten years imprisonment. Eight other former soldiers received three-year sentences for acting as accomplices in the attack. Current life Quintana worked on the teaching staff of the School of Psychology of the Andres Bello University in Vi√±a del Mar. Her teaching post deals specifically with the treatment of children and adolescents.

In 2010, she emigrated to Canada to pursue a doctorate (PhD) in psychology at the University of Montreal. (in French) and serves as scientific attach√© at the Embassy of Chile in Canada.
