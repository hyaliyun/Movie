Sypniewskis can also be found all over the world, particularly in the United States, Brazil, and Germany. \\"Sypniewski\\" roughly translates as \\"one who originates from Sypniewo' ‚Äì (that is from Sypien's settlement). There are several manorial estates which bear the name of Sypniewo or a similar spelling as in the German \\"Zippnow\\". Sypniewski Prince Jozef Etymology The etymology of 'Sypien' suggests the use of water in association with the making or use of a clay vessel or fortification and the breeding or capture of fish. In short, the origins suggest a clan that lived either in a fortified place on or near water (rivers/lakes) or who kept game and fisheries. In all likelihood both options apply. Most of the old manorial estates bearing the name Sypniewo are located near or on a lake or river (i.e. Lake Margonin). In German the name is translated as 'Seeort' (place on the lake). Nobility patent, manorial estates and origins The Sypniewskis belong to Pomeranian nobility, Polish Szlachta (nobility), Prussian nobility, and later to German and Austrian nobilities (after partition of Poland), and, although mentioned already c. 1390 and earlier (as Siebnitz and/or Zipniv Pomeranian nobility), obtained a formal Polish nobility patent in writing from the king Casimir IV Jagiellon, who granted them the right to keep and use the OdrowƒÖ≈º coat of arms in 1480. Zlota Ksiega Szlachty Polskiej (\\"Golden Book of Polish Nobility\\") states that the Sypniewski ‚Äì Odrowaz arms are said to have come from the Podg√≥rze region, recorded around 1190 (there are still few Sypniewski families owning land and living in this area today). Their further nobility confirmations through Bonifacius Sypniewski is dated in 1483 and confirmed in German Nobility Book. A Jan Sypniewski resettled in the Brzesko-Litewskie province (presently part of Lithuania, back then center of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), and branches are found in Pozna≈Ñ, Nowy SƒÖcz, and Prussia. Around the 16th century, the Sypniewski family is found living in Greater Poland owning large manorial estates there, and later we find them in West Prussia on the estate of Zmijewie (Kojalowicz, Niesiecki, Goluchowski). Various other documents found in Polish archives refer to the family and its holdings in and around, what was later to become, the Silesian and Prussian/German/Polish border. On the division of Poland in the 18th century, the Sypniewski family is then also mentioned as Prussian nobility, and is found in Siebmacher's Wappenbuch under the OdrowƒÖ≈º armories. In the 14th century, a branch of the Prussian family von Runge (originating from an area around Wroclav/Breslau) adopted the surname Sypniewski. At the turn of the 16th, and again at the 18th to 19th century, the family split into various and distinct branches, with some members moving to the Austrian province of Galicia (holding the Austrian title Ritter von Odrowaz or Ritter von Sypniewski (see also Ritter) granted by the Empress Maria Theresia), near the Ukraine and Moldavia, then on to Hungary and the Balkans. This Austrian branch produced several k.u.k. officers from the famous Theresian Military Academy in Vienna. Sypniewski family church in Sypniewo Estates Sypniewski estate at Skoraszewice One of the earliest recorded Sypniewski's estate transfers is from 1392, when Dobieslaw von Runge (Polish: Dobies≈Çaw Runge) married daughter of Janek from Sypniewo (Polish: Janek z Sypniewa / Janek Sypniewski, German: Johannes von Zippnow) and received Sypniewo (German: Zippnow) in dowry, as well as wedding promise of building first church there (it was completed and expanded in next decades). It is not known when exactly von Runge adopted his wife's family name, but most of their children were already known to use Sypniewski family name. Several estates called Sypniewo (which means in Polish \\"the Sypniewski's Estate\\" or \\"Sypniewski's town\\") still exist today, such as estate south of Samotschin in the former Kreis Chodziesen/Kolmar in Posen, and larger holding called Sypniewo (Zippnow) located north of Samotschin, in Z≈Çot√≥w county. One of their largest estates near Wyrzysk was sold to King Frederick the Great in 1774. Most of Sypniewski's estates were located in former West Prussia, now part of Wielkopolska and Pomorze, Poland. Wielkopolska, or Greater Poland, is referred to as crib, or home of the Polanie (a Slavic tribe that lived in the heart of Poland, from which name Polska ‚Äì Poland ‚Äì was later derived ); it also contains some of the oldest towns in today's Poland. \\"Sypniewskis at Palace in Homel\\", oil on canvass painting, c. 1850 Sypniewskis also had estates in Polesie, formerly the largest province of Poland (currently part of Belarus and Ukraine), several near the city of ≈ªytomierz (currently under Ukrainian jurisdiction since 1945) and large manorial estate crowned with beautiful palace until the end of the 18th century near the city of Homel (currently under Belarussian jurisdiction since 1945); only portion of the cellars and some of the foundations in the ground is what remains today from this once wealthy estate, which used to provide living for about 500 peasant families. Politician Jan Odrowaz-Sypniewski was born there around 1760. He was a legate of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth's Great Parliament and one of the promoters of the first in Europe democratic Constitution of May 3, 1791 (and second in the world, after the United States Constitution). His grandson, Dyonizy Odrowaz-Sypniewski, an architect, exiled to United States and U.K., where he published ‚Äì at his own expenses ‚Äì many treatises and political books regarding Partitions of Poland and advocated for restitution of Poland in general. His avid anti-Russian, anti-Prussian and anti-Austrian activities didn't go well with U.K. government (all 3 countries being allies of British Empire at the time). Once he became persona non grata in Britain and was forced to leave the country, he settled in Brasil, where he built roads and bridges. Polesie was inhabited by Ruthenians, called Polesians; of Ukrainian descent. During the 16th and 17th centuries, Sypniewski were found in Polesia as a notable family mentioned in the Listracje (inventories) similar to the registry of England's Domesday Book. The Partitions of Poland and turbulent times of 18th and 19th centuries have forced many Polish families to emigrate to other regions of Europe (particularly Prussia) and later to emigrate further across the Oceans. Among many others: Heinrich Sypniewski from Cologne had a Eucalyptus farm in Brazil; Maria Anna Sypniewski from Bydgodzcz settled in Australia in 1835; Thaddeus Sypniewski landed in Halifax, Nova Scotia, then moved to Pennsylvania in 1850; Heinrich Sypniewski, Colonel of Austrian Empire Army, have been exiled/imprisoned in Siberia after the end of 1863 Polish January Uprising and killed there in 1866 (presumably in Uprising of Polish political exiles in Siberia). Julian Sypniewski tried to establish large farm in United States in 1876 (see California links below). Sypniewskis could also be found near Bydgoszcz (German: Bromberg) and Wroclaw (German: Breslau) in the manor of Skoraszewice until World War II. Others were in Vienna, Passau, Nuremberg, Cologne, Sweden, Switzerland, and ‚Äì to a lesser degree ‚Äì in other European countries.

The Sypniewskis use the OdrowƒÖ≈º clan arms. NOTE: Polish coats of arms were never provided for individuals or for individual families, but for a much wider group of clans people (a bit like sharing a tartan colour). The Polish nobleman added the name of his clan to the family name. In addition to the adjectival surname ending \\"ski\\" or \\"cki\\" meaning 'from' or 'of'. The standard form, for example, was \\"Peter Sypniewski, herbu OdrowƒÖ≈º\\" or simply \\"Piotr OdrowƒÖ≈º Sypniewski\\". In this century the surname Sypniewski has been transmuted into the Celtic d'Argantel OdrowƒÖ≈º. The book, Galician Nobility, (Galicia was SE Poland as part of the Austrian Empire) lists the arms for Sypniewski (table 449): a family of Polish gentry from the Polish Province (Wojewodztwo) of Prussia, where they are first recorded in 1490. Descendant Boniface Sypniewski is entered in the records of Galicia in 1783. The coat of arms is OdrowƒÖ≈º. Siebmacher's Wappenbuch (Siebmacher's armorial reference book) under Preussischer Adel (Prussian Nobility), records Sypniewski (table 269), a Polish family, connected to the Odrowaz coat of arms, still 20 years ago (at the printing of the above stated book, c. 1840) in possession of a sizeable piece of farmland. Coat of arms: Look under Gliscinski III (Odrowaz). OdrowƒÖ≈º Coat of Arms Description for the Sypniewski name . Arms: Gules, an arrow argent point to chief, the base terminating as inverted horns. (Red, a silver arrow, point upwards, the base terminating as inverted horns) Crest: out of a crest coronet proper, a pananache of peacock plumes proper, charged with arms, fesseway (horizontally). Motto: No motto is recorded Heraldic Colors: Argent: silver and is usually depicted in heraldic painting as white ‚Äì or: gold and is usually depicted in heraldic painting as yellow. Gules: red in heraldic language. Red is a royal color. Red/argent stands for bold and resolutely honest with martial prowess, boldness, and valor Heraldic Symbolism: Arrows: arrows usually are traced to achievements of the original bearer during the Crusades. Arrows are symbolic of one who is ready and fit for military encounter. Peacock Feathers: the peacock represents personal pride. Feathers also symbolise conquests in Syria/Holy Land over the Saracens in the Crusades. Ducal Coronet: The four leaves on the corenet surmounting the helmet were originally oak leaves, then changed to the Polish traditional strawberry leaves. Leaves symbolise victorious battle, and/or a title of nobility. Comments The OdrowƒÖ≈º arms are also prominently shown in the film Knights of the Teutonic Order (Polish: Krzy≈ºacy), one of the largest film productions ever in Poland, based on the novel of the same name by Nobel prize laureate, Henryk Sienkiewicz. King W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jagie≈Ç≈Ço ‚Äì a historic person, king of Poland between 1381 and 1434 ‚Äì was the first Polish king to recognize Sypniewski's Pomeranian nobility and to bestow them the OdrowƒÖ≈º coat of arms. It was very important event in Sypniewskis history and turning point in their genealogy, as from that moment on vast majority of Sypniewski's clan members were no longer identified as Pomeranian family, but chose to side with, and de facto became Poles. Sypniewski clan provided king Jagie≈Ç≈Ço (and later his son, king Casimir IV Jagiellon) with knights, arms, soldiers, supplies and money in their fight against Teutonic Order and they took active part in taking of Bydgoszcz, famous Battle of Grunwald, long Thirteen Years' War, and in every war fought by Poland since (i.e. Rotmistrz (Captain of Cavalry, equivalent of modern Colonel) Jan Stefan Sypniewski had briefly occupied Moscow in 1605 during Polish‚ÄìMuscovite War) \\"Hunt with Greyhounds\\" by Feliks Sypniewski, 1870 Feliks Sypniewski was a famous Polish Painter who later emigrated to Paris and is buried at the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery. Felicjan Sypniewski was a scientist whose ground-breaking studies and scientific publications influenced the next generations of Polish naturalists and have laid down foundations of malacology and algology. J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski mausoleum in Vilnius, work of sculptor Boles≈Çaw Sypniewski, 1937 Renowned sculptor Boles≈Çaw Sypniewski donated almost 2 years of his work for the mausoleum of the most famous leader of Second Polish Republic, Marshal J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski. His Matka i Serce Syna (Mother and Her Son's Heart) black granite tombstone is still laying there today in Vilnius's Rossa Cemetery in Lithuania (back then part of Poland), where ‚Äì in accordance with his wishes ‚Äì the heart of Marshal Pi≈Çsudski was buried in his mother's tomb. Sypniewskis have, over the millennium, produced gallant knights, politicians, artists, authors, engineers, officers, musicians, medical doctors, teachers, government administrators, few explorers, and even sportsmen in recent times. Members of the Sypniewski family have been actively involved in Polish politics for seven centuries and took part in all Polish wars and uprisings, including Polish Underground Resistance and French Resistance during World War II (i.e. Jan Sypniewski, later known as Jan Slave, journalist at the Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung). Even though by today many of the families bearing the surname Sypniewski may no longer be classified as being truly 'related', often physical traits are still intact. On the male side they usually are tall, with a high forehead and 'Geheimratsecken' (naturally receded hairline above the temple) with an oval face. Also certain forenames were given within the families and only with the advent of the World Wars was this changed. For example: Jan, Stanislas and Adalbert (or Albert) were very common. It is worthwhile to note that the large parish church in Margonin (near Sypniewo/Chrustowo) is named after Saint Patron of Sypniewski family ‚Äì St Adalbert, and it was erected by Sypniewskis at the end of 14th Century. Patron Saint of Sypniewskis California links As recounted in her memoirs, famous actress Helena Modrzejewska (usually known as Helena Modjeska) emigrated to the United States in 1876. The group of emigrants who settled in Anaheim, California, also included Henryk Sienkiewicz and his good friend Julian Sypniewski, whose Sypniewski's family stories and old tell-tales could have been ‚Äì or most likely were ‚Äì important inspirations for stories later written by Sienkiewicz in his novels. It is also worth to mention that Julian's friend, Stanis≈Çaw Witkiewicz (father of famous Polish poet, writer and painter, Stanis≈Çaw Ignacy Witkiewicz) and Adam Chmielowski had planned to be part of this group, but they changed their minds in a last minute.

A Ver-o-Mar, Aver-o-Mar or Averomar is an urban area in P√≥voa de Varzim. It is a former civil parish currently located in Uni√£o das Freguesias de Aver-o-Mar, Amorim e Terroso, of which it is its seat. In the census of 2001, it had a population of 8,675 inhabitants and a total area of 5.21 km¬≤. A 2012 law merged the parish with neighbouring Amorim and Terroso, becoming the northern parish of the city of P√≥voa de Varzim. Aver-o-Mar naming is unknown, although the current form means \\"watching the sea\\" in Portuguese. This is a misinterpretation of the name made in early 20th century. The ancient people's Abremar pronunciation is still common and Averomar form is becoming popular, used in the new crest and by the local football association, the Averomar F.C. History Medas of Sargassum seaweed are found throughout the beaches of the parish and consist of sun-dried piles of seaweed intended for natural farming fertilization. A Ver-o-Mar was once a fishing-farmer village in the north of the city of P√≥voa de Varzim, Abonemar is the oldest name of A Ver-o-Mar and dates from 1099. The settlement of the place started with the medieval knight Louren√ßo Fernandes da Cunha, of the Honour of Varzim. In ecclesiastical terms, it was part of the parish of Amorim, although in the 17th century it was annexed to the town of P√≥voa de Varzim due to a growing community of fishing- farmers and the growing importance of P√≥voa de Varzim. It became an independent parish from Amorim in 1922. In late 20th century, the parish became urbanized as a consequence of north expansion of Bairro Norte of the city of P√≥voa de Varzim. Despite being included in the urban area of the city of P√≥voa de Varzim since the 1995 city limits expansion, the parish gained town status on July 1, 2003. In January 2006, the national government approved and recognized the extension of the city of P√≥voa de Varzim to this and three other parishes. Geography Cape Santo Andr√© is located in the north of the parish. Esteiro River divides the parish in two parts: North and South. The south of Aver-o-mar is grouped with the north of Bairro Norte and is known as Agro-Velho and is an urban and beach resort district. On the other hand, Santo Andr√© (today considered the extreme north of the city) in the north shoreline of the parish has retained its old fishing character related with Bairro Sul (in the extreme south). The centre of Aver-o-Mar is located around Nossa Senhora das Neves Avenue.

The western terminus of the route is at PA 29 in Green Lane, Montgomery County. The eastern terminus is at Interstate 95 (I-95) in Bensalem Township, Bucks County. The route heads through a mix of suburban and rural areas of northern Montgomery County as a two-lane road, passing through Harleysville, before coming to an interchange with I-476 (Pennsylvania Turnpike Northeast Extension) in Towamencin Township. From this point, PA 63 continues through predominantly suburban areas of eastern Montgomery County as a two- to four-lane road, passing through Lansdale, Maple Glen, Willow Grove, and Huntingdon Valley. Upon entering Northeast Philadelphia, the route follows Red Lion Road and U.S. Route 1 (US 1) before heading southeast on a freeway called Woodhaven Road to I-95. What would become PA 63 was originally designated as Legislative Route 198 in 1911, running from Green Lane to Northeast Philadelphia. When first designated, PA 63 ran from PA 29 in Green Lane to US 611 (now PA 611) in Willow Grove, following its current alignment. In 1928, it was extended east to PA 532 in Northeast Philadelphia, following Edge Hill Road, Terwood Road, and Welsh Road to Bethayres, where the route continued along Philmont Avenue to PA 532\\\\. By 1940, PA 63 was moved to its current alignment between Willow Grove and Bethayres and was realigned to follow Byberry Road to PA 532\\\\. The former alignment of PA 63 on Edge Hill Road and Terwood Road became PA 163, which was removed by 1950. In the 1950s, the Woodhaven Road freeway was planned to serve Northeast Philadelphia, connecting I-95 to PA 63 at Philmont Avenue, with a further extension to I-276 (Pennsylvania Turnpike) in Southampton once planned. The freeway was completed to Evans Street just west of US 1 in the 1960s and PA 63 was extended along Byberry Road and Woodhaven Road to end at I-95. In the 1980s, PA 63 was rerouted to use Red Lion Road and US 1 to reach Woodhaven Road. Plans to extend Woodhaven Road through the rest of Northeast Philadelphia remain, but have been on hold due to community opposition and financial constraints. Route description Green Lane to Lansdale PA 63 westbound past PA 113 in Harleysville PA 63 begins at a \\"T\\" intersection with PA 29 in the borough of Green Lane in Montgomery County. From this intersection, the route heads southeast as two-lane undivided Main Street, passing by several homes. After crossing Upper Ridge Road, the road enters Marlborough Township and becomes Sumneytown Pike. PA 63 continues through rural areas with some development, passing through the community of Sumneytown. Upon crossing Unami Creek, the route enters Upper Salford Township and heads into forested areas, where PA 63 meets the southern terminus of PA 563 (Ridge Road). Following that intersection, the road passes through a mix of farmland, woodland, and residential developments. The route crosses over the East Branch Perkiomen Creek before entering Lower Salford Township. At this point, PA 63 becomes Main Street and heads into the community of Harleysville, where it passes through suburban residential neighborhoods before heading into a commercial area, crossing PA 113 (Harleysville Pike). In the area of this intersection, PA 63 is briefly a divided highway. After PA 113, the road passes through the center of Harleysville. The road turns south, becoming a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane before it heads to the southeast again as a two-lane road, continuing past a mix of farm fields and residential and commercial development. PA 63 bypasses the community of Mainland to the northeast with two westbound lanes and one eastbound lane before entering Towamencin Township near a crossing of Skippack Creek and heading into the North Penn Valley region. In Towamencin Township, PA 63 widens to four lanes and is called Sumneytown Pike again, passing woods and development before reaching an interchange with I-476 (Pennsylvania Turnpike Northeast Extension). The I-476 junction includes a full interchange via a ramp passing through the toll plaza along with additional E-ZPass-only ramps to southbound I-476 and from northbound I-476. Southeast of I-476, the route enters a commercial area in the community of Kulpsville, where the highway turns northeast onto Forty Foot Road, a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane. PA 63 passes through suburban areas, narrowing to three lanes before widening back to five lanes. Along this stretch, the route passes southeast of Dock Mennonite Academy. A short distance later, PA 63 turns southeast onto Welsh Road and Forty Foot Road continues northeast toward the borough of Hatfield as PA 463. Along two- lane Welsh Road, PA 63 forms the border between Hatfield Township to the northeast and Towamencin Township to the southwest. The road heads through residential neighborhoods. At the intersection with Squirrel Lane, PA 63 briefly forms the border between the borough of Lansdale to the northeast and Towamencin Township to the southwest before fully entering Lansdale and becoming Main Street. The road passes a mix of homes and businesses before coming to the northern terminus of PA 363 (Valley Forge Road). After the PA 363 junction, the road runs through the downtown of Lansdale, where the route crosses SEPTA's Lansdale/Doylestown Line at-grade south of the Lansdale station and intersects Broad Street. The road leaves downtown and heads into areas of homes and businesses. At a crossing of Wissahickon Creek, PA 63 forms the border between Lansdale to the northeast and Upper Gwynedd Township to the southwest before running along the border of Montgomery Township and Upper Gwynedd Township after crossing North Wales Road. Lansdale to Philadelphia PA 63 westbound past North Wales Road in Lansdale At North Wales Road, PA 63 again becomes Welsh Road and passes several businesses as a four-lane divided road. The route becomes a two-lane undivided road again as it passes between business parks to the northeast and farms and woods to the southwest ahead of an intersection with US 202 Bus. (Dekalb Pike). Upon intersecting US 202 and the southern terminus of the US 202 Parkway Trail, PA 63 forms the border between Montgomery Township to the northeast and Lower Gwynedd Township to the southwest. The road passes through a mix of residential and commercial development, widening into a three-lane road with two westbound lanes and one eastbound lane. PA 63 leaves the North Penn Valley region as it becomes the border between Horsham Township and Lower Gwynedd Township and crosses PA 309 (Bethlehem Pike), with jughandles controlling the movements from PA 309 to PA 63. The route narrows back to two lanes as it passes residential subdivisions, crossing the Park Creek before becoming the border between Horsham Township to the northeast and Upper Dublin Township to the southwest at the Tennis Avenue intersection. Farther southeast, the road crosses Butler Pike. Upon reaching the community of Maple Glen, PA 63 passes businesses and crosses PA 152 (Limekiln Pike) and Norristown Road. Past Maple Glen, the road continues past more homes along with a few farms. PA 63 eastbound on Moreland Road in Willow GroveFarther southeast, the route widens into a three-lane road with one eastbound lane and two westbound lanes as it passes near business parks and some residential and commercial development. PA 63 soon widens to four lanes at Dresher Road, with two lanes in each direction. The road becomes a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane as it comes to the Blair Mill Road intersection, at which point it forms the border between Upper Moreland Township to the northeast and Upper Dublin Township to the southwest. The road becomes a four-lane divided highway that soon becomes undivided as it crosses over the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-276) and Norfolk Southern's Morrisville Line before heading into a mix of residential and commercial areas as a five-lane road again. Upon forming the border between Upper Moreland Township and Abington Township, PA 63 becomes Moreland Road, briefly turning into a divided highway at the Fitzwatertown Road intersection. The route heads into the community of Willow Grove as a five-lane road. The road enters business areas, becoming a divided highway again as it passes to the northeast of the Willow Grove Park Mall. PA 63 intersects Easton Road and becomes undivided as it crosses SEPTA's Warminster Line at-grade. The route passes a mix of homes and businesses as it comes to an junction with PA 611 (Old York Road). At this point, PA 63 heads into wooded residential areas as a two-lane road. At the intersection with Edge Hill Road, the route turns southwest onto that road and fully enters Abington Township, eventually turning southeast onto Old Welsh Road. The road curves to the east and crosses into Lower Moreland Township. The road becomes Welsh Road again and widens to four lanes as it enters a mix of residential and commercial establishments in the community of Huntingdon Valley, crossing the Pennypack Trail at the Terwood Road intersection and the Pennypack Creek. At the intersection with Carson Terrace/Walton Road, there is a westbound jughandle for right turns and U-turns. Upon intersecting PA 232 (Huntingdon Pike) in Bethayres, the route becomes Philmont Avenue and narrows back to two lanes. PA 63 turns south onto Red Lion Road and crosses SEPTA's West Trenton Line at-grade as it continues through wooded residential subdivisions, making a turn to the southeast into the city of Philadelphia in Philadelphia County. Philadelphia to Bensalem PA 63 westbound on Woodhaven Road at the Franklin Mills Boulevard/Millbrook Road exit in Northeast PhiladelphiaPA 63 enters the Northeast Philadelphia section of the city a short distance past the Pine Road intersection. PA 63 widens into a four-lane divided highway and passes between a former golf course (site of the former Budd Company Red Lion plant) to the north and homes and industrial developments to the south. The road continues through a mix of residential and commercial development as it crosses PA 532 (Bustleton Avenue). East of PA 532, the route passes over CSX's Trenton Subdivision and comes to an intersection with US 1 (Roosevelt Boulevard). PA 63 turns northeast and follows a concurrency with US 1, which at this point is a wide boulevard with local-express lanes. The road carries a 3-3-3-3 lane configuration as it heads northeast through areas of businesses and industrial parks. After intersecting Byberry Road, the concurrency with US 1 ends at an unfinished cloverleaf interchange with Woodhaven Road, where PA 63 heads southeast onto the Woodhaven Road freeway. Woodhaven Road continues northwest of US 1 as an unnumbered divided road to an intersection with Evans Street, which connects to Byberry Road, before coming to a dead end at an entrance to an industrial park. Woodhaven Road, a six-lane freeway lined with frontage roads, carries the route southeast between an industrial park to the northeast and residential neighborhoods to the southwest as it crosses Byberry Creek and comes to the Thornton Road interchange. Past here, the freeway passes residential areas on both sides and has interchanges with Academy Road and Knights Road. At this point, the surroundings along PA 63 become commercial as it comes to the Franklin Mills Boulevard/Millbrook Road interchange that provides access to the Philadelphia Mills shopping mall. Within the interchange, the road is temporarily four lanes wide. The frontage roads end past that interchange as Woodhaven Road turns south to cross Poquessing Creek and head into Bensalem Township in Bucks County. Upon entering Bucks County, PA 63 has an interchange with US 13\\\\. A short distance south of US 13, PA 63 ends at an interchange with I-95. This interchange also has access to the park and ride at the Cornwells Heights station on Amtrak's Northeast Corridor and SEPTA's Trenton Line. In 2015, PA 63 had an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 65,000 vehicles between Knights Road and I-95 to a low of 10,000 vehicles between PA 309 and PA 152. The entire length of PA 63 is part of the National Highway System. History PA 63 westbound in Abington Township In 1911, what would become PA 63 was designated as Legislative Route 198 between Green Lane and Philadelphia. By 1927, PA 63 was designated to run from PA 29 in Green Lane to US 611 (now PA 611) in Willow Grove, following its current alignment. PA 63 was extended east to PA 532 in Philadelphia in 1928, following its current alignment between US 611 and Edge Hill Road in Willow Grove. From this intersection, the road followed Edge Hill Road and Terwood Road east before following Welsh Road to an intersection with PA 163/PA 232 in Bethayres and following Philmont Avenue between PA 163/PA 232 and PA 532. By 1930, PA 63 had seven auxiliary routes: PA 163, PA 263, PA 363, PA 463, PA 563, PA 663, and PA 763. PA 63 was moved to its current alignment between Willow Grove and Bethayres by 1940, with the former alignment of the route between these two points becoming a rerouted PA 163\\\\. Also by this time, PA 63 was rerouted to follow Byberry Road between Philmont Avenue and PA 532. By 1950, the PA 163 designation was removed from Edge Hill Road and Terwood Road. In 1954, the Philadelphia City Planning Commission planned a freeway named Woodhaven Road to run from I-95 in Bensalem Township northwest to Lower Moreland Township, passing through Northeast Philadelphia. Construction on Woodhaven Road began in 1962 with completion between I-95 and US 13 in 1963 and northwest past US 1 to Evans Street in 1966. Following the completion of the freeway, PA 63 was extended east onto it. By 1983, PA 63 was rerouted to use Red Lion Road and US 1 between Philmont Avenue and Woodhaven Road instead of Byberry Road. Stub end of the Woodhaven Road freeway west of the US 1 interchange in Northeast Philadelphia The PA 63 freeway was at one time proposed to continue north from Northeast Philadelphia to the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-276) in Southampton. From here, the freeway would become known as the Cross County Expressway and serve the PA 611 corridor, utilizing the Doylestown Bypass as it continued north to the south end of the PA 33 freeway near Easton. The freeway south of the Pennsylvania Turnpike was planned to cost $68 million and be finished by 1975 while the part north of there was planned to be completed by 1985. However, this freeway was never built. Meanwhile, plans still existed to extend Woodhaven Road from Evans Street to the Montgomery County border at Philmont Avenue. This extension had been approved by the Federal Highway Administration in 1968 and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) had torn down 28 homes in the Somerton neighborhood in order to build the road. The Woodhaven Road extension was cancelled in the late 1970s due to funding issues and opposition from Lower Moreland Township residents who did not want to see increased congestion from the extension. In 1988, the Woodhaven Road extension resurfaced as a means to relieve traffic along Byberry Road. This proposed extension was to continue west only to PA 532 (Bustleton Avenue). However, Lower Moreland Township officials again voiced their opposition that the extension would increase traffic on area roads. In addition, residents in the Westwood development blocked the proposed road. PennDOT removed the Woodhaven Road extension from its long-range plans in 1996. Despite this, plans for extending Woodhaven Road resurfaced in 2001 when local officials began discussing the extension with PennDOT. Various options for the extension were created, including extending the freeway as far as Philmont Avenue and possibly PA 232 (Huntingdon Pike) as well as widening and improving adjacent roads including PA 532 (Bustleton Avenue) and Byberry Road. In addition, the project also calls for replacing the weight-restricted Byberry Road bridge over a CSX rail line. After putting the Woodhaven Road project on hold due to budget issues, PennDOT brought it back again as a parkway that is to continue west to PA 532, with an estimated cost of $30 million. Under this proposal, the railroad bridge is to be replaced, with Byberry Road terminating at cul- de-sacs on both sides. The current Woodhaven Road extension plan continues to face opposition from area residents who fear increased traffic. In June 2011, the portion of PA 63 in Mainland between Freed Road and Old Forty Foot Road was shifted to a new alignment to the northeast, with the old alignment becoming Mainland Road. Major intersections PA 63 Alternate Truck Pennsylvania Route 63 Alternate Truck is a truck route around a weight- restricted bridge over the Unami Creek in Marlborough Township, on which trucks over 30 tons and combination loads over 40 tons are prohibited. The route follows PA 29, Park Avenue, Schwenksville Road, and Old Skippack Road. It was signed in 2013.

In an internal combustion engine, fuel starvation is defined as the failure of the fuel system to supply sufficient fuel to allow the engine to run properly, for example due to blockage, vapor lock, contamination by water, malfunction of the fuel pump or incorrect operation, leading to loss of power or engine stoppage. Fuel exhaustion (also called fuel depletion) is defined instead as an occurrence in which the vehicle in question becomes completely devoid of usable fuel, with results similar to those of fuel starvation. All engine-powered modes of transport can be affected by fuel starvation, although the problem is most serious for aircraft in flight. Ships are affected to the extent that without propulsion they cannot maneuver to avoid collisions or beaching. On aircraft, fuel starvation is often the result of incorrect fuel management, for example by selecting to feed the engine from an empty tank while fuel is present in another one. Fuel exhaustion and starvation incidents on aircraft Many incidents have happened on aircraft where fuel exhaustion or starvation played a role. A partial list of these incidents follows: * On 19 June 1954, a Convair CV-240 aircraft operated by Swissair registered HB-IRW ran out of fuel over the English Channel near Folkestone.

On finding that the nose gear could neither be retracted nor extended, the crew diverted the flight to Leningrad where they prepared for an emergency landing by circling the city burning off fuel. While circling the city the crew made repeated attempts to get the landing gear to lock down; they possibly became over- preoccupied with this and the aircraft ran out of fuel.

Overview The Natives Land Act of 1913\\"19 June 1913 Native Land Act \\", This day in history, publish date unknown (accessed 20 December 2007). was the first major piece of segregation legislation passed by the Union Parliament. It was replaced in 1991. The act decreed that natives were not allowed to buy land from whites and vice versa. Exceptions had to be approved by the Governor-General. The native areas left initially totaled less than 10% of the entire land mass of the Union, which was later expanded to 13%.Collins, Robert O. and James M. Burns: A History of Sub-Saharan Africa, p. 346. Cambridge University Press, 2007 The Act further prohibited the practice of serfdom or sharecropping. It also protected existing agreements or arrangement of land hired or leased by both parties. This land was in \\"native reserve\\" areas, which meant it was under \\"communal\\" tenure vested in African chiefs: it could not be bought, sold or used as surety. Outside such areas, perhaps of even greater significance for black farming was that the Act forbade black tenant farming on white-owned land. Since so many black farmers were sharecroppers or labor tenants that had a devastating effect, but its full implementation was not immediate. The Act strengthened the chiefs, who were part of the state administration, but it forced many blacks into the \\"white\\" areas into wage labor. Impact The opposition was modest but vocal. John Dube used his newspaper to create an issue. As president of what would become the African National Congress, he supported whites like William Cullen Wilcox, who had created the Zululand Industrial Improvement Company. That had led to them supplying land to thousands of black people in Natal. Dube was one of five people who were sent to Britain to try and overturn the law once it came into force in South Africa.Natives Land Act, SAHistory.org.za, accessed 1 August 2013 Sol Plaatje traveled to Britain with the SANNC (later the African National Congress) to protest the Natives Land Act but to no avail. He collected transcripts of court deliberations on the Natives Land Act and testimonies from those directly subject to the act in the 1916 Book Native Life in South Africa. Political ironies Much political irony surrounded the Act: * The minister at the time of its introduction, J.W. Sauer, was a Cape Liberal who opposed disenfranchisement of blacks. He, however, advocated for \\"separate residential areas for Whites and Natives\\" in the Parliamentary debate on the bill. * John Tengo Jabavu, a prominent \\"educated African\\" welcomed the Act, but Merriman and Schreiner opposed the Act on principle.see C.F.J Muller (ed), 500 Years, History of South Africa as well as references therein  See also  *History of South Africa (1910‚Äì1948) *South Africa under apartheid References Bibliography L.M.

The story deals with the trouble arising from the indecision of a squire in choosing an heir to his estate. Of Trollope's shorter novels, it has been called one of his most experimental. Plot summary Indefer Jones is the aged squire, between seventy and eighty years of age, of a large manor, Llanfeare, in Carmarthen, Wales. His niece, Isabel Brodrick, has lived with him for years after the remarriage of her father, and endeared herself to everyone. However, according to his strong traditional beliefs, the estate must be passed down to a male heir. His sole male blood relative is his nephew Henry Jones, a London clerk. Henry has, in the past, incurred debts that the squire had paid off, been \\"sent away from Oxford\\", and generally made a poor impression on his occasional visits to Llanfeare. Nevertheless, Henry is told of his uncle's intention to make him his heir and is invited to pay a visit. Isabel rejects her uncle's suggestion that she solve his dilemma by marrying Henry, as she cannot stand her cousin. Indefer Jones finds his nephew to be just as detestable as ever. As a result, he overcomes his prejudice and changes his will one final time, in Isabel's favour. Unfortunately, he dies before he can tell anyone. Finding the document hidden in a book of sermons by accident, Henry vacillates between keeping silent and revealing its location. He is neither good enough to give up the estate nor evil enough to burn the document, fearing disgrace, a long jail sentence and, not least, eternal damnation. Instead, he comforts himself by reasoning that doing nothing cannot be a crime. Indefer Jones had had his last will witnessed by two of his tenants, but since the will cannot be found despite a thorough search of the house, Henry inherits the estate. However, suspicions are only strengthened by his guilty manner. Some of the old squire's longtime servants quit. He takes to spending hours in the library, where the will is hidden. The local newspaper begins to publish accounts of the affair that are insulting and seemingly libelous to Henry. It accuses him of destroying the will and usurping the estate from Isabel, whom everybody knows and respects. The old squire's lawyer, Mr Apjohn, himself suspecting that Henry knows more than he lets on, approaches the new squire about the articles, pressuring the unwilling young man into taking legal action against the editor. Henry finds that this only makes things worse. The prospect of being cross-examined in the witness box fills him with dread. Mr Apjohn, by clever questioning, gets a good idea about where the will is. Henry knows that time is running out, but still procrastinates. Mr Apjohn and Mr Brodrick, Isabel's father, visit Henry at home and find the document, despite Henry's ineffectual efforts to stop them. Because he did not destroy the will, Henry is permitted to return to his job in London with his reputation intact and ¬£4000, the amount Isabel was bequeathed in the other will.

The film is set during the reign of Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor and was filmed in color (not common for Czechoslovak films in that period), because of the international release. It is one of the best known films of Jan Werich, who's performing a dual role of Emperor Rudolf and baker Matƒõj. Plot Model of the Golem from the film Part I Aging and eccentric Emperor Rudolf II, who is obsessed with finding the Golem, refuses to hear out ambassadors and falls into destructive fits. Later he welcomes Magister Edward Kelley at Prague Castle and shows him his alchemist laboratory. All the alchemists are either charlatans or fools. Rudolf wants alchemist Scotta to make him an elixir of youth and pressures him into performing a magic ritual at night. While performing the ritual, they accidentally stumble upon the Golem. However the Golem can't be awaken without a little ball called shem. Meanwhile, a baker Matƒõj is confronted with angry mob which demands bread rolls but cannot receive them, because the bread rolls are baked only for the emperor. When the corrupt head of the bakery leaves the building, Matƒõj distributes the emperor's bread rolls to the poor and is imprisoned in the dungeons for this deed. Kelley reveals his homunculus Sirael, whom the Emperor wishes to teach everything of our world, including love. Rudolf does not know that Sirael is a regular country girl, Kate≈ôina, acting after coercion by Kelley. Kate≈ôina and Matƒõj communicate through vents between Kelley's room and the dungeons and fall in love through conversation, although they cannot see each other. Alchemist Scotta concocts an elixir of youth for Rudolf (actually a mix of strong alcoholic drinks and morphium). Meanwhile, Matƒõj escapes the dungeons. Part II Rudolf drinks Scotta's concoction and falls asleep. Matƒõj ends up in the emperor's rooms. Servants of the Emperor find the fugitive Matƒõj, who bears a remarkable likeness to the Emperor in his young days, hiding in the bath and, believing the rejuvenation has worked, they hold him for the emperor and dress him accordingly. After waking up, Rudolf sees Matƒõj and mistakes him for his younger self in the mirror. Elated by his supposed new vigor, Rudolf and his old loyal servant ride alone in a carriage to the countryside to remind themselves of the sins of their misspent youth. The emperor's mistress Countess Strada also believes the rejuvenation worked and drinks up the remnants of the concoction. She embarrasses Matƒõj by her advances and then falls asleep. The horrified and confused Matƒõj puts her on top of a two-story bed. Matƒõj decides that he has to act as Rudolf because it is his best chance to find Kate≈ôina. Matƒõj as the emperor dismisses Rudolf's astrologer, minimises the extravagant expenses and deals with all the waiting ambassadors. He attempts to rule fairly, all the while searching for Kate≈ôina. He finds a helper in Scotta, who knows his elixir could not have worked and therefore knows Matƒõj is not the real emperor. Meanwhile, intrigue abounds among the emperor's councillors and Kelley. They want to overthrow Rudolf and get power for themselves. They all want to utilise the Golem and chase after the shem, which is eventually found by Matƒõj. Kelley then pressures Kate≈ôina into killing the emperor, but Matƒõj reveals to her that he's not Rudolf. Matƒõj's identity is also revealed to the councillors. They all try to capture him and Kate≈ôina, while also fighting among themselves. Kelley is killed and Matƒõj is captured. Court Astrologer gets a shem from Matƒõj and awakes the Golem. Lang kills the astrologer and Russworm kills Lang. Then Russworm is killed by the Golem, who only obeys the person who put the shem in its head. The Emperor returns when the Golem is destroying the palace. Eventually, with the help of the townspeople, Matƒõj succeeds in stopping the Golem and removing the shem. Rudolf is reinstated, after Matƒõj convinces him to give the Golem to the people rather than use it for his own means. The Golem is installed in the bakery and its power is used to make more bread for everyone.

That film eventually became Le Golem directed by Julien Duvivier, who significantly re-wrote the screenplay and changed it into a horror film. Werich returned to this theme in 1950s and co- wrote a screenplay with Ji≈ô√≠ Brdeƒçka. It was originally directed by Ji≈ô√≠ Krejƒç√≠k, but after disputes with the Werich, Krejƒç√≠k was replaced by Martin Friƒç. The whole film was shot in Barrandov Studios. It was the third Czechoslovak full-length color film after Warriors of Faith and Temno. It was shot on Eastmancolor and Agfacolor material. Costumes were based on designs by Ji≈ô√≠ Trnka.  Release  The Emperor and the Golem had a premiere on 4 January 1952 as a two-part film, 155 minutes long. International version A 112-minute-long one-part international version was prepared, with most propaganda flavoured scenes cut out (e.g., songs). It was successfully distributed in many countries, including Italy, West Germany, East Germany, Sweden, USA, UK, Finland, France, Belgium or Argentina.

It is based on a novel by Utsana Phloengtham. The film premiered at the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival. In Thailand, the film was controversial because its sex scenes tested the censorship bounds of the 1930 Film Act. Plot Jan is a boy growing up in 1930s Siam in a wealthy, dysfunctional family where sex has a huge impact on everyone's lives. Jan Dara is viewed by his father, Khun Luang, as cursed, since his mother died giving birth to him. The abusive Luang is a womaniser who has sex with many women in his household. The younger sister of Jan's mother, Aunt Waad, is brought in to care for Jan. Luang has sexual relations with her, which causes young Jan to be jealous, since he has developed feelings for Waad. Waad and Luang have a daughter, Kaew, who is the apple of Luang's eye. From the beginning, he spoils her and teaches her to hate the \\"bastard Jan\\". Waad, in return, treats Jan like her own son and despises the spoiled and bratty Kaew. Later, another of Khun Luang's women, the sophisticated nymphomaniac Boonlueang, moves into a guesthouse on the estate, and she teaches Jan his first lessons in the ways of love. Jan is then framed for the rape of Kaew, who was having relations with the son of one of the family's maids. But it is Jan who ends up punished for Kaew's transgressions. Later, it emerges that Kaew is pregnant, with the seed of her own father. To smooth over the damage to the family's reputation, Jan is asked to return to the family estate and is forced into an arranged marriage with his half-sister Kaew. He does so, as long as he is promised the deed to the estate, which he views as a form of vindication against his father for the abuse he endured from him during his childhood. Kaew gives birth to Luang's child and curses it after it has emerged from her womb. The child displays classic dysmorphic features found in genetic mutations such as trisomy 21, commonly known as Down's syndrome. Kaew, meanwhile, enters into a lesbian relationship with Boonlueang. When Jan discovers this, he demands that Kaew give him his own child and forces himself upon her repeatedly. Kaew becomes pregnant with Jan's child but she refuses to have the baby she is carrying, and with Boonlueang's assistance, performs a bloody, self-administered abortion. Jan subsequently finds himself repeating the libidinous patterns of his father, going as far as to have sex with a maid in his father's sitting room, in front of the portrait of his mother. Jan wonders why he can't escape the cycle of sexual abuse started by his father. Then it is revealed that Jan is the product of a gang rape of his mother.

The highway is signed as south-north. Route description Route 122 begins in Blackstone as a continuation of Rhode Island Route 122. The route passes along the Blackstone River through Blackstone and Millville as the main street through both towns. In Uxbridge the route crosses the river before meeting Route 146A at its northern terminus, in front of Uxbridge District Court. In the center of Uxbridge the route intersects Route 16. From there, the route continues northward into Northbridge. Route 122 roughly bisects that town, crossing the Blackstone River again in the northern end of town. From Northbridge, Route 122 enters the Worcester suburb of Grafton. In the Farnumsville section of town, Route 122A begins, splitting from its parent route and heading west into Sutton. Route 122, meanwhile, continues north, crossing through the center of town before becoming concurrent with Route 140 near Lake Ripple. The two routes split after nearly , crossing under the Massachusetts Turnpike (I-90) without junction just before the split. From there, Route 122 turns west, crossing the corner of Millbury (where Exit 11 of the Mass Pike meets the route) before entering the city of Worcester. Intersection with Route 122A at Kelley Square in Worcester Once in Worcester, Route 122 meets U.S. Route 20 at an above- grade intersection. It then passes through the southeast corner of town before heading towards downtown. Once there, Route 122 crosses under I-290 at Exit 14. The route then splits along two one-way streets before meeting Route 122A once more at Kelley Square. The two routes head westward, splitting when Route 122A joins a concurrency with Route 9 and Route 12. Route 122 then continues westward into the town of Paxton. In Paxton, the route runs concurrently with Route 56 from near Kettle Brook Reservoir Number 4 to the center of town, where Route 56 joins Route 31 for a brief concurrency before those two routes split. Meanwhile, Route 122 heads northwestward past Moore State Park and into the town of Rutland. In Rutland, Route 122A finally ends at its parent route, near Long Pond and Rutland State Park. Route 122 turns westward through the park into the town of Oakham, where Route 122 meets the northern end of Route 148 before turning northward into Barre. Orange In Barre, Route 122 becomes concurrent with Route 32, continuing through Barre Common (where Route 62 begins) and into Petersham. Near Petersham Center, Route 32 splits from Route 122, and Route 32A crosses the route shortly after. The route also crosses Turnpike Street, the former routing of Route 21 before the creation of the Quabbin Reservoir. In neighboring New Salem (in Franklin County), Route 122 becomes concurrent with U.S. Route 202. Approximately a mile later, the two routes split shortly after entering Orange. Route 122 turns northwest from there, crossing Route 2 at Exit 15 before finally ending at Route 2A, just north of the Millers River in the center of town. To celebrate Route 122 North becoming a State Scenic Byway, in October and November 2007, BJ Hill walked the corridor, beginning in downtown Orange and ending at Worcester State College.

In the final form of this tradition, she is said to have been born in about 1135 in Haza and to have died at Caleruega (Dominic's birthplace) on 4 August 1205. Juana de Aza was beatified in 1828. Legend In the earliest biography of Dominic, by Jordan of Saxony, Dominic's parents are not named, but the story is told that before his birth his mother dreamed that a dog leapt from her womb carrying a torch in its mouth and set the world aflame.\\"History of St. Dominic, The Dominican Province of St. Joseph Jordan adds that Dominic was brought up by his parents and a maternal uncle who was an archbishop.Jordan of Saxony, Libellus de principiis 4. A later source, still of the 13th century, gives the names of Dominic's mother and father as Juana and Felix.Pedro Ferrando, Legenda Sancti Dominici 4. Nearly a century after Dominic's birth, a local author asserts that Dominic's father was vir venerabilis et dives in populo suo (\\"an honoured and wealthy man in his village\\");Rodrigo de Cerrato, Vita S. Dominici. later hagiographers, elaborating on this, gradually developed identities for his father, said to be a member of the local noble family Guzm√°n and for his mother, who was eventually attached to the neighbouring noble Aza family. Nothing is known of her childhood, but she probably married at a customarily young age. She and her husband, Felix, had four sons and a daughter. When the two older boys were grown, she went to the Abbey church at Silos to pray for another son.Walsh, Michael J., \\"Joan of Aza\\", A New Dictionary of Saints, Liturgical Press, 2007 She is said to have had a dream in which St. Dominic of Silos told her that she would have a son, who would be a shining light to the Church. She decided to name the child Dominic.Butler, Alban. and Burns, Paul. \\"Blessed Joan of Aza\\", Lives of the Saints, A&C; Black, 1998 According to Dominican tradition, his mother later saw the moon on his forehead, yet at his Baptism, his godmother perceived it as a star. The boy was christened probably after St. Dominic of Silos whose nearby shrine was a favorite of his mother.

It is about one mile north of the A422 road between Milton Keynes and Buckingham and forms part of South Northamptonshire district. At the time of the 2001 census, the parish's population was 299 people,Office for National Statistics: Wicken CP: Parish headcounts. Retrieved 30 November 2009 reducing slightly to 295 at the 2011 Census. History The earliest archeological remains for the area are a prehistoric ring ditch, although the first identified settlement is a small Roman settlement on the edge of the modern village. The modern village dates from Saxon times and is mentioned in the Domesday Book. During the Middle Ages, it seems to have functioned as two villages: Wick Dive and Wick Hamon, separated by a stream and both in separate manors. In 1511 the two manors were purchased by John Spencer of Snitterfield, Warwicks., whose grandson, Sir John Spencer of Wormleighton, secured in 1587, the union of Wick Dive and Wick Hamon into one parish. An episode of the Channel 4 TV programme Time Team featured multiple archaeological digs in Wicken and researched its history. The archaeologists concluded that Wick Hamon, adjoining the Roman site was the older of the two villages by two centuries, and that the pre-existing (or abandoned) Roman settlement attracted the Saxons to that location.  Name  The modern Name of Wicken dates from the 1587 union of the two manors. The names of the two earlier villages derive from the name of respective land lords. The wealthier Wick Dive takes its name from William de Dive, who acquired it in 1242, while Wick Hamon derives from the de Hamon family, who held the estate in the 12th century. The Wick portion is either derived from the Saxon Word Wick for farm, or the Roman 'vicus', for settlement, often associated with an adjacent Roman garrison, farm or centre of industry. This is the most likely origin of the name here.The tale of two villages, Channel 4 Time Team: series 14, episode 7, broadcast 2007. accessed 12 September 2012 References  External links  *Village website *Wicken in the VCH *GENUKI(tm) page *Some details about the parish church *'Wicken', A History of the County of Northampton: Volume 5: The Hundred of Cleley (2002), pp.413-438.

It is located in Cusco, Peru, which was the capital of the empire.  History  Originally named Intikancha or Intiwasi,Qorikancha, A Homage to the Mystical, Magical, most Famous and Oldest City of the American Continent it was dedicated to Inti, and is located at the former Inca capital of Cusco. Most of the temple was destroyed after the 16th-century war with the Spanish conquistadors, as settlers also took it apart to build their own churches and residences. Much of its stonework was used as the foundation for the seventeenth-century Santo Domingo Convent. It was built after the 1650 earthquake destroyed the first Dominican convent. To construct Coricancha, the Inca used ashlar masonry, building from the placement of similarly sized cuboid stones that they had cut and shaped for this purpose.Carolyn Dean, ‚ÄúThe Inka Married the Earth: Integrated Outcrops and the Making of Place,‚Äù The Art Bulletin 89, no. 3 (2007): 502‚Äì18. The use of ashlar masonry made the temple much more difficult to construct, as the Inca did not use any stone with a slight imperfection or break. By choosing this masonry type, the Inca intentionally demonstrated the importance of the building through the extent of the labor necessary to build the structure. Through the arduous labor needed to construct buildings with ashlar masonry, this form of construction came to signify the Inca's imperial power to mobilize and direct local labor forces. The replication throughout Andean South America of Inca architectural techniques, such as those employed at Coricancha, expressed the extent of Inca control over a vast geographic region. Pachakutiq Inca Yupanqui rebuilt Cusco and the House of the Sun, enriching it with more oracles and edifices, and adding plates of fine gold. He provided vases of gold and silver for the Mama- cunas, nuns or cloistered women, to use in the veneration services. Finally, he took the bodies of the seven deceased Incas and adorned them with masks, head-dresses, medals, bracelets, and sceptres of gold, placing them on a golden bench.de Gamboa, P.S., 2015, History of the Incas, Lexington, The walls were once covered in sheets of gold,Prescott, W.H., 2011, The History of the Conquest of Peru, Digireads.com Publishing, and the adjacent courtyard was filled with golden statues. Spanish reports tell of an opulence that was \\"fabulous beyond belief\\". When the Spanish in 1533 required the Inca to raise a ransom in gold for the life of their leader Atahualpa, most of the gold was collected from Coricancha. The Spanish colonists built the Convent of Santo Domingo on the site, demolishing the temple and using its foundations for the cathedral. They also used parts of the building for other churches and residences. Construction took most of a century. This is one of numerous sites where the Spanish incorporated Inca stonework into the structure of a colonial building. Major earthquakes severely damaged the church, but the Inca stone walls, built out of huge, tightly interlocking blocks of stone, still stand due to their sophisticated stone masonry. Nearby is an underground archaeological museum that contains mummies, textiles, and sacred idols from the site. Inca astronomy Inca constellations in the Milky Way Similarities are found in the semicircular temples found in the Temple of the Sun in Cusco, the Torreon in Machu Picchu, and the Temple of the Sun in P√≠sac. In particular, all three exhibit a \\"parabolic enclosure wall\\" of the finest stonework, as Bingham describes it. These structures were also used for similar purposes, including the observation of solstices and Inca constellations. Within the Milky Way, which the Inca called mayu or Celestial River, the Inca distinguished dark area or clouds, which they called yana phuyu. These were considered silhouettes or shadows of animals drinking from the river water. Amongst the animals named by the Inca, was a llama extended from Scorpius to Alpha Centauri and Beta Centauri, in which those two stars formed the llama's eyes, or llamacnawin. A baby llama, llama-cria, was inverted underneath. To the left of the llamas is a red-eyed fox, atoq, which lies between Sagittarius and the tail of Scorpius. The tail of Scorpius is known as a storehouse, or qullqa. A partridge, yutu, was just below the Southern Cross, and a toad, hamp'atu, to the lower right. A serpent, machaguay, extends off to the right. During the Inti Raymi, the Sapa Inca and curacas would proceed from the Haucaypata, where they greeted the rising June solstice sun, to the inner court of the Coricancha. On a bench in the \\"sun room\\", the Sapa Inca sat with the mummies of his ancestors. This and other rooms were oriented northeast‚Äìsouthwest, shingled in gold plate, and embedded with emeralds and turquoise. Focusing the sun's rays with a concave mirror, the Sapa Inca would light a fire for the burnt sacrifice of llamas. Children were also sacrificed in certain circumstances; they were brought to Cusco following a ceque and huaca route of tribute. The Coricancha is located at the confluence of two rivers.

She served as a commissioned ship for 5 years and 4 months. In 1946, the ship was decommissioned, and was later sold to Levin Metals Corp. on 19 November 1973. Procyon was given five battle stars for its service during the World War II. Service history Procyon (AK‚Äì19) was laid down 15 January 1940 as Maritime Commission C hull 22, SS Sweepstakes, by the Tampa Shipbuilding Company, Tampa, Florida, launched and acquired by the Navy, through MARAD, 14 November 1940; sponsored by Miss Dorthy Ramspeck; and commissioned on 8 August 1941 as Procyon (AK‚Äì19), at Charleston, S.C., Comdr. Lem P. Padgett, Jr., in command. Pacific After shakedown, Procyon was assigned to the Naval Transportation Service and she reported to Norfolk, Va. on 25 August to load cargo for Caribbean bases. She sailed 2 September reaching as far as Panama before returning to Norfolk on the 23rd. She put to sea again on 10 October, transited the Panama Canal 20 October bound for San Pedro, Calif., and proceeded to Pearl Harbor 12 November. Procyon remained at Pearl 18-24 November and returned to California at the end of the month. She was entering the Mare Island Navy Yard the day of the attack on Pearl Harbor, when, receiving emergency sailing orders, she shifted to a San Francisco dock to load a cargo of blood plasma and medical supplies. Departing San Francisco 12 December, she entered Pearl Harbor on the 19th. Procyon returned to San Francisco 6 January 1942 and commenced round-the-clock loading of fighter planes and their Marine pilots destined for Pago Pago, Samoa. She completed three round trips between those points by 23 April. Invasion of North Africa Procyon transported troops and equipment through August to Malevu Island, Noumea and Pearl, and then transferred to the Atlantic in September to join the Amphibious Force of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet for the planned invasion of North Africa. She sailed 24 October with the Southern Attack Group of Admiral H. Kent Hewitt's Western Naval Task Force, which gathered at midnight 7-8 November off the Moroccan coast. Procyon participated in the assault operations which brought about the surrender of Cape Fedhela and Casablanca and returned to Norfolk 30 November for conversion to an attack cargo ship. Redesignated AKA‚Äì2 on 1 February 1943, she spent the next two months conducting amphibious warfare exercises in the Chesapeake Bay area. In April she put into the yards at Philadelphia for the installation of radar and additional armament. Sicily, Salerno, and southern France Procyon participated in the invasion landings at Sicily in July and at Salerno in September. Unloading army vehicles at Naples, following the invasion at Salerno, Procyon moved to Arzew, Algeria and commenced a program of shipboard indoctrination and practice assault landings for the training of Free French Forces, including Algerian and Senegalese troops. When this training ceased 22 November, she shifted to Oran and joined a convoy headed for the Clyde River in Scotland. She entered the Clyde River 9 December and docked at Glasgow to off-load mail, army personnel, and much needed aircraft parts and ammunition cases. Ten days later she passed out to sea in convoy and under escort by HMS Searcher, bound for the U.S. She arrived Norfolk 2 January 1944, and following independent operations, shifted to New York 14 February to load cargo for shipment to the British Isles. Skirting known positions of German \\"wolf- packs\\", she reached Swansea, Wales 11 March and sailed again 13 April with a merchant convoy bound for Algeria. She entered the now familiar Mers-el-Kebir Harbor 26 April and commenced a hectic training schedule in preparation for the invasion of Southern France. Procyon, with men of the 180th Battalion of the famed 45th \\"Thunderbird\\" Division embarked, participated in the landings at the Golfe de St. Tropez 15 August. Three times she returned to France carrying Army cargo from Naples before sailing 20 October to return to Philadelphia. Battle of Okinawa Procyon departed Philadelphia 28 December for her second tour of Pacific duty, arriving Pearl Harbor 19 January 1945. She operated in support of the Okinawa invasion during April, returning to San Francisco 19 May to begin a series of shuttle runs to Hawaii, Ulithi and Samar. In October she transported occupation troops to Japan from the Philippines, and by 2 November she was making best speed for Seattle, Washington. Decommissioning and sale Procyon arrived Seattle 14 November, shifted to Portland, Oregon 18 November, and sailed two days later to report to the Mare Island Navy Yard for inactivation. She decommissioned there on 23 March 1946, was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 12 April, and was returned to MARAD on 1 July for lay up at Suisun Bay, California.

She was completed in 1929 as SS Pennsylvania, and refitted and renamed as SS Argentina in 1938. From 1942 to 1946 she was the War Shipping Administration operated troopship Argentina. She was laid up in 1958 and scrapped in 1964.  Building  Pennsylvania was the last of three sister ships built by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company of Newport News, Virginia for the American Line Steamship Corporation, which at the time was part of J. P. Morgan's International Mercantile Marine Co. Pennsylvania was launched on 10 October 1929. She joined () and SS Virginia () in the fleet of American Lines' Panama Pacific Lines subsidiary. Pennsylvania was a steamship, with oil-fired furnaces heating her boilers to power two General Electric steam turbo generators supplying current for her electric propulsion motors. Pennsylvania was equipped with submarine signalling apparatus and wireless direction finding equipment, and from about 1934 she was equipped with a gyrocompass. Some of Pennsylvanias first class cabins had en suite bathrooms. With Panama Pacific Lines, Pennsylvanias two funnels would have been red with a blue top, with a white band dividing the blue from the red.  SS Pennsylvania  SS Pennsylvania filmed in the 1930s Panama Pacific Line, part of the American Line Steamship Corp, operated Pennsylvania and her sisters between New York and San Francisco via the Panama Canal until 1938. California, Virginia and Pennsylvania were subsidised to carry mail on this route for the United States Postal Service. In June 1937 the United States Congress withdrew all maritime mail subsidies, which by then included a total of $450,000 per year for Panama Pacific's three liners. At the beginning of March 1938 the Panama Canal tolls were revised, increasing Panama Pacific's costs by $37,000 per year. As a result of these cost increases and continuing labor difficulties Panama Pacific discontinued its New York ‚Äì California service and took all three liners out of service.  SS Argentina  The US Maritime Commission took over the three sister ships in 1937 and had them extensively refurbished. Each was fireproofed to comply with Federal safety regulations, which had been revised as a result of the fire in 1934 that destroyed the liner . Pennsylvanias passenger capacity was revised to 500. She was equipped to carry of cargo, of which was refrigerated. Pennsylvania had been built with two funnels but during the refit this was reduced to one. The refit increased Pennsylvanias tonnage by about 2,000 tons. On 4 October 1938 Moore-McCormack Lines contracted to operate California, Virginia, Pennsylvania and 10 cargo ships between the USA and South America as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Good Neighbor policy. Moore-McCormack renamed the three passenger liners Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, and assigned them to the fleet of its American Republics Lines subsidiary. With Moore-McCormack Lines Argentinas funnel would have been buff with a black top. A broad green band divided the buff from the black. On each side of the funnel the green band bore a red capital M within a white disk. Moore-McCormack put the three sisters into service between New York and Buenos Aires via the Caribbean, Brazil and Montevideo. Argentina made her first trip on this route in November 1938. On 8 December 1941 the USA joined the Second World War and on 27 December Argentina arrived in New York from South America. By 2 January she had loaded cargo and 200 passengers had booked to sail on her the next day for South America. However, the War Shipping Administration intervened, cancelling her sailing and requisitioning her to be a US Army Transport troopship.  Troop ship  During the war Argentina, one of the large, fast vessels able to sail independently when required, was operated by the War Shipping Administration's agents and allocated to Army troop transport. On 23 January 1942 Argentina loaded and sailed from the New York Port of Embarkation as the flagship of a convoy of seven troopships, designated Convoy BT.200, under United States Navy escort reaching Melbourne, Australia on 27 February. At the time this troop movement of POPPY FORCE, also designated Task Force 6814, destined for New Caledonia by way of Australia was the largest attempted with the entire convoy having a troop capacity of almost 22,000. After reorganizing loading that had hastily loaded in New York the convoy, redesignated ZK.7, departed Melbourne for New Caledonia 7 March and arrived 12 March 1942 where later the force was organized into the Americal Division under General Alexander Patch. On 22 April Argentina sailed from San Francisco carrying the United States Army 32nd Infantry Division. She reached Port Adelaide, Australia on 14 May. She sailed mid May with hundreds of Australian RAAF aircrew bound for Canada and flight training under the Empire Air Training scheme. A ships menu dated 22 May shows they were well catered for en route. On 20 June Argentina arrived in New York. She embarked elements of the USAAF Eighth Air Force including famed fighter ace Robin Olds, and the United States Army 5th Corps and the Army's entire 56th Signal Battalion. She left New York under naval escort on 1 July and reached Gourock, Scotland on 15 July. On 11 December 1942 Argentina and one of her sister ships, Brazil, sailed from New Jersey carrying elements of the 2nd Armored Division. On 24 December they reached Casablanca in French Morocco. Early in 1943 Argentina made a second transatlantic crossing to Casablanca. In April 1943 Argentina left the USA for Algiers and Oran in French Algeria, then Gibraltar, the Firth of Clyde, Scotland; Freetown, Sierra Leone; Durban, South Africa and back to Casablanca. In August 1943 she sailed to Argentina and thence to Liverpool, England. In October 1943 Argentina left the USA for the United Kingdom; Augusta, Sicily; Bari, Italy and Algiers. She got back to New York in December and then made three crossings from Boston to the Clyde. After the last of those crossings she arrived in New York in April 1944, and then made six more crossings to the UK. In December 1944 Argentina left the USA on a voyage to Naples, Marseille, Oran and Gibraltar, returning to Boston in January 1945. She then made four transatlantic crossings to Le Havre, France and Southampton, England. From the first three she returned to New York, but from the last she returned to Boston. In June 1945 Argentina left Southampton bringing elements of the 56th Signal Battalion back to the USA. The next month she brought home from Europe 5,000 troops of the USAAF 454th Bombardment Wing and 15th Air Force, reaching New York on 28 July. Argentina then made a voyage to Taranto and Naples in Italy; one to Marseille, Algiers and Naples; one to Marseille; one to Plymouth, England and Le Havre and another to Le Havre. On 16 November 1945 Argentina arrived in New York from Le Havre carrying 4,206 soldiers, 130 civilians, 124 nurses and 88 German scientists. The OSS had brought the scientists to the USA under Operation Paperclip to obtain German scientific and technical secrets. In an attempt to maintain secrecy the soldiers, civilians and nurses were kept on board while the scientists were disembarked and whisked away in a small fleet of waiting buses. After her last troop voyage Argentina reached New York on 1 January 1946. During and after the war she made a total of 56 troop voyages, covered and carried at least 175,592 soldiers. On 26 January 1946 Argentina left Southampton as a \\"dependent transport\\" carrying the first 452 war brides, one war groom and 173 children to the USA in the Army's highly publicized \\"Operation Diaper's\\" European phase. The brides came from England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Malta. Due to stormy weather the ship reached New York a day late on 4 February. As she was the first war bride ship she was greeted by New York Mayor William O'Dwyer, a band, news cameras and 200 reporters. On 6 May 1946 SS Argentina was meant to carry 411 passengers to Cobh, Ireland and Southampton, but she was delayed by a labor dispute. When she was a US Army Transport, Argentinas crew had worked a shift system of eight hours on and 12 hours off. Now that she was back in civilian service, Moore-McCormack Lines wanted her crew to return to a passenger shift system of nine hours on and 13 off, but the National Maritime Union disagreed. On 12 July Argentina arrived in New York from Southampton. Her passengers included another 452 British war brides 173 children and one bridegroom. On 19 July she left New York carrying 519 passengers to Southampton and Le Havre. She completed her last \\"dependent transport\\" voyage on 31 August. Post-war For her first six months carrying civilian passengers, Argentina still had her cramped and spartan troopship accommodation. Then on 4 November 1946 she entered Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation's 56th St Shipyard in Brooklyn, New York, to be refitted as a civilian liner again. Her new accommodation had cabins for 359 first class and 160 cabin class passengers and was designed by Donald Deskey Associates, who gave her various state rooms nine different color schemes. On 3 June 1947 it was announced that Argentinas re-fit would be completed on 15 July and that she would return to the New York ‚Äì Buenos Aires route on 25 July. Instead strike action by Bethlehem Shipbuilding workers delayed the work for several months and it was not until 30 December that she left the shipyard for her final 14 hours of sea trials. On 1 January 1948 Argentina was restored to Moore-McCormack, which reported that her first two voyages were \\"booked full\\". On 14 January 1948 Argentina was given the US Navy Reserve pennant. On the same day her library was dedicated in memory of Henry Olin Billings, a former Moore-McCormack employee who was killed on 1 November 1942 when his command, the Liberty Ship , was torpedoed off the coast of French Equatorial Africa. On 15 January Argentina left New York on Moore-McCormack's South America run; the first of the three sisters to return to their pre-war civilian route. The round trip was scheduled to take 38 days, with two-way fares starting at $1,030 for first class and $630 for cabin class. In the spring of 1950 newspaper and television cameras photographed Captain Thomas Simmons of the Argentina and Captain William Brophy on a tugboat of the McAllister Towing Company communicating by walkie-talkie, demonstrating how this form of radio helped to maneuver ships in port. On 14 September 1950, two days out of Port of Spain, Trinidad, Argentina met a large schooner that had sailed from Las Palmas, Gran Canaria, with 119 men aboard bound for Venezuela. The schooner was off-course, almost out of food and other supplies and was flying distress signals. Argentina replenished the schooner's food and water stores and put her back on course for Venezuela. Argentina reached New York at the end of her last South American voyage on 5 August 1958. She and Brazil were laid up as members of the National Defense Reserve Fleet on the James River at Fort Eustis, Virginia, where Uruguay had already been laid up since 1954. Late in 1963 the United States Department of Commerce offered Uruguay for sale. In 1964 she was sold for scrap to Peck Iron and Metals of Norfolk, Virginia. Peck re-sold her on to Luria Bros who scrapped her at Kearny, New Jersey.  Notable passengers and visitors  In 1941, future U.S. President John F. Kennedy sailed on \\"Argentina\\" from the USA to Brazil and Argentina. In 1948 the adventurer Sasha Siemel sailed on Argentina from Brazil to the USA. When the ship docked in New York he gave ABC a filmed interview aboard about hunting jaguars in the Mato Grosso. In New York in April 1948 the cast of the Broadway play Mister Roberts, including Henry Fonda, judged a fashion show aboard Argentina. On 5 November 1948 photographer and film-maker Ruth Orkin sailed aboard Argentina to film and write about her passengers for Coronet magazine. On 18 February 1950 Harry Sandford Brown, Chairman of the Foster Wheeler Corporation, died aboard Argentina while en route from New York to Rio de Janeiro. In March 1951 Clark Gable and his then wife Sylvia Ashley came aboard Argentina to see friends off on a voyage. The tennis star, model and radio presenter Jinx Falkenburg sailed on Argentina early in the 1950s. On 8 January 1953 Emmet J McCormack, co-founder of Moore-McCormack Lines, boarded Argentina with his wife. Albert V Moore, his fellow co-founder, visited him aboard at 1700 hrs to see him off. Moore returned ashore and died at 2300 hrs that evening. The Italian tenor Tito Schipa and his wife Antoinette \\"Lilli\\" Michel were photographed sailing on Argentina (date not recorded).

The facility, often offered as a product to automotive OEMs, allows engine operation in different operating regimes and offers measurement of several physical variables associated with the engine operation. A sophisticated engine test stand houses several sensors (or transducers), data acquisition features and actuators to control the engine state. The sensors would measure several physical variables of interest which typically include: * crankshaft torque and angular velocity * intake air and fuel consumption rates, often detected using volumetric and/or gravimetric measurement methods * air-fuel ratio for the intake mixture, often detected using an exhaust gas oxygen sensor * environment pollutant concentrations in the exhaust gas such as carbon monoxide, different configurations of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter * temperatures and gas pressures at several locations on the engine body such as engine oil temperature, spark plug temperature, exhaust gas temperature, intake manifold pressure * atmospheric conditions such as temperature, pressure, and humidity Information gathered through the sensors is often processed and logged through data acquisition systems. Actuators allow for attaining a desired engine state (often characterized as a unique combination of engine torque and speed). For gasoline engines, the actuators may include an intake throttle actuator, a loading device for the engine such as an induction motor. The engine test stands are often custom-packaged considering requirements of the OEM customer. They often include microcontroller-based feedback control systems with following features: * closed-loop desired speed operation (useful towards characterization of steady-state or transient engine performance) * closed- loop desired torque operation (useful towards emulation of in-vehicle, on-road scenarios, thereby enabling an alternate way of characterization of steady- state or transient engine performance) Engine test stand applications Engine Test Stand with WALTHER-PRAEZISION Multicoupling System * Research and Development of engines, typically at an OEM laboratory * Tuning of in-use engines, typically at service centers or for racing applications * End of production line at an OEM factory. The changing of the engines to be tested takes place automatically, and fluid, electrical and exhaust gas lines are connected to the test stand and engine and disconnected from them by means of docking systems. When the engine docks in the test stand the mechanical drive shaft is automatically connected to it. Engine testing for research and development HORIBA engine test stand type TITAN Research and Development (R&D;) activities on engines at automobile OEMs have necessitated sophisticated engine test stands. Automobile OEMs are usually interested in developing engines that meet the following threefold objectives: * to provide high fuel efficiency * to improve drivability and durability * to be in compliance to relevant emission legislation Consequently, an R&D; engine test stands allow for a full-fledged engine development exercise through measurement, control and record of several relevant engine variables. Typical tests include ones that: * determine fuel efficiency and drivability: torque- speed performance test under steady-state and transient conditions * determine durability: ageing tests, oil and lubrication tests * determine compliance to relevant emission legislations: volumetric and mass emission tests over stated emission test cycles * gain further knowledge about the engine itself: engine mapping exercise or development of multidimensional input-output maps among different engine variables. e.g. a map from intake manifold pressure and engine speed to intake air flow rate. Magnifying LDV sensors in engine testing Spark plug velocimeter - SPV Laser technology adds useful tools to improve engine design during engine testing. Lasers sensors using laser Doppler velocimetry with magnifying LDV sensors can record the movements of gas particles during the entire 2-stroke, 4-stroke or rotary combustion cycle. These spark plug velocimeter (SPV) sensors can be inserted into the spark plug hole of the combustion chamber of the engine. The sensors can be adjusted to all depth levels of the pistons movement - typically ranging from 0 - 50mm. The magnifying LDV sensors will record the velocity and direction of the movement of gas particles. Engine design can then be optimised with the recorded data and the visualisation of the combustion cycle. The flow and direction of the gas particles can be improved by changing shape and sizes of the chamber, valves, spark plug, injectors and pistons resulting in improved combustion and performance and in reduced emissions. Engine heads with two spark plug holes per cylinder can be used to record the velocity and direction of the movement of gas particles in an engine running under live, firing conditions. SPVs can also be added to the intake and the exhaust to record flow of particles in these areas to further improve engine design. Magnifying LDV sensors have been used in even more extreme situations to measure particle flow in rocket engines.

When only a single R√©union subspecies is accepted, alopekion and xerophilus are considered to represent morphs of the nominate. Description It has a length of 9.5 cm. Its plumage exhibits a colour morph which varies from gray to brown. The rump is coloured conspicuous white, the rest of the body is blue grey. The legs are nearly blackish. There is also a conspicuous ring of white feathers around the chestnut coloured eyes. Biology It inhabits woodlands, forests, and gardens. It is the only endemic bird from R√©union which has adapted to man-made conditions. Its diet consists of insects, fruits and nectar. It is also the pollinator for orchids like Angraecum striatum or the endemic Trochetia species. It moves often in small groups from six to twenty birds in search of food. They are very noisy. The breeding period is in the southern summer. The female lays two to four pale blue eggs in a cup-shaped nest which is padded with plant material.

It is owned by Cumulus Media and airs a sports radio format. While Cumulus owns three sports stations in Oklahoma City, 98.1 WWLS-FM and AM 930 WKY have mostly local shows on weekdays while 640 KWPN carries mostly syndicated programming from ESPN Radio. The studios and offices are on NW 64th Street in Northwest Oklahoma City.KATT.com/station-information KWPN's transmitter is off West Indian Hills Road in Norman.Radio-Locator.com/KWPN It broadcasts at 5,000 watts by day. But because AM 640 is a clear channel frequency, reserved for Class A KFI Los Angeles, KWPN must reduce power to 1,000 watts at night to avoid interference. A directional antenna is used at all times. History University of Oklahoma On September 26, 1922, the station signed on as WNAD in Norman, Oklahoma. It was owned by the University of Oklahoma, with its studios located in Science Hall.Broadcasting Yearbook 1935 page 50 In the early days of broadcasting, several universities put non-commercial radio stations on the air as a service to students, faculty and the local community. From 1929 to 1941, WNAD broadcast on 1010 kilocycles and was required to go off the air at sunset. In 1941, when the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA) was enacted, the station moved to 640 kHz. Being lower on the dial gave WNAD a wider coverage area. But the station was still required to be off the air at night, to protect 50,000 watt clear channel KFI Los Angeles. (AM radio waves travel further at night.) Changes in Ownership In 1973, after the university put an FM station on the air, 106.3 KGOU, it decided to sell the AM station. WNAD was acquired by Oklahoma Communications, Inc.Broadcasting Yearbook 1980 page C-184 WNAD became a Mutual Broadcasting System network affiliate. The station was acquired by Norman Broadcasting in 1981.Broadcasting Yearbook 1982 page C-192 It switched its call sign to WWLS. It is unusual for stations in Oklahoma to have call letters beginning with a \\"W.\\" Nearly all start with a \\"K.\\" But because the station traces its history back to 1922, when Oklahoma was in W territory, the station was granted new call letters beginning with a W from the Federal Communications Commission. Sports Radio In 1989, WWLS was acquired by Fox Broadcasting. It was not associated with the Fox Television Network, but owned by local businessman John Fox.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1999 page D-357 A sports radio format was started. The new management changed the station's city of license with the FCC, to Moore, Oklahoma. This was coupled with permission to broadcast around the clock at 1,000 watts. A few years later, daytime power was boosted to 5,000 watts. Former logo used until 2012, as WWLS-AM In 1999, WWLS was acquired by Citadel Broadcasting, the forerunner to today's Cumulus Broadcasting.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2001 page D-362 It flipped to a sports radio format, calling itself \\"The Sports Animal.\\" It later got an FM simulcast on 98.1, which became WWLS-FM. On April 2, 2012, WWLS AM 640 split from its \\"Sports Animal\\" simulcast with WWLS-FM 98.1 and switched to mostly programming from ESPN Radio under new call letters, KWPN. WWLS-FM continued with mostly local sports programming on weekdays, later getting simulcast on co-owned AM 930 WKY. Nights and weekends, all three stations often carry the same ESPN Radio programming.

Building The Showroom Cinema is housed in a 1936 art deco building which was formerly the Kennings car dealership.Ruth Harman and John Minnis, Sheffield (Pevsner Architectural Guides) It was first opened in 1993 with two screens; further phases of development have added another two screens, a bar and cafe and a meeting room, making it one of the attractions of Sheffield's Cultural Industries Quarter, in the south-east of the city centre. Much of the remainder of the building is the Workstation, offices intended for use by business working in the cultural industries. The conversion programme was completed in 1998 and saw an entrance to the cinema created from Sheaf Square; the Workstation retains the original entrance on Paternoster Row. The building was used in the video for the Arctic Monkeys song \\"Leave Before the Lights Come On\\" in 2006. In 2015 plans for a thorough refurbishment of the Showroom were announced, but the cinema must raise ¬£250,000 to undertake the work. The venue's four screens are to be refurbished, including new seats and carpeting throughout, as well as updated foyers and toilets.

It is part of the municipality Agios Minas, and located approximately 9 kilometers from the capital of the island, Chios (town), also known locally as Chora. There are medieval manuscripts that refer to the village but no sign of the Middle Ages was preserved. The inhabitants are mainly farmers. The main church is devoted to Virgin Mary and it is an example of the local architecture of the 19th century. The haven of Neochori is beach of Agia Fotia. Near the beach are hotels, rooms and studios to let, taverns, and cafes. The Monastery of Agios Minas overlooks the village from the hill nearby. This monastery was built during 1572 -1595 by the Reverend Father Neofitos Koumanos and his son, Father Menas, at the time of Patriarch Jeremiah II. Initially it housed monks, but in 1932 it was converted into a nunnery. During the Turkish occupation, it maintained a school and a noteworthy library. This monastery is famous in world history for the massacre of 1822 when crowds of Chians were killed by the Turks or burned inside the chapel and in the courtyard of the monastery. Today, there is still evidence of the victims with the bloodstained stone floors of the chapel. The bones of many of the victims are kept in the Mausoleum of the 40 Martyrs in the courtyard of the monastery.

He currently works as the caretaker and sporting director of FC Oberneuland, He was also part of the West German national team that was crowned World champion in 1990. Club career During nearly ten professional seasons, Hermann played with SV Werder Bremen. He made his Bundesliga debut on 11 December 1982, in a 2‚Äì1 win at VfL Bochum, but it would be only his only appearance of the season, and he would also amass a single one in the following. After a slow start, Hermann became a very important defensive member, often partnering legendary Miroslav Votava in central midfield. In the 1987‚Äì88 season, he played in 30 matches (receiving only one yellow card), as Werder won the national championship after 23 years. As his presence was diminishing he still appeared in six matches during the club's 1991‚Äì92 Cup Winners' Cup victorious campaign, although he did not play in the final. In December 1992, Hermann left Bremen after 231 top-flight matches for another first-divisioner, SG Wattenscheid 09 (in Bochum) helping the modest side retain its top level status in his one half season stint. He finished his career in the second division with Hannover 96, retiring at almost 36; he later had a go at managing in amateur football, mainly with VSK Osterholz-Scharmbeck. International career Hermann recorded just two international caps for West Germany in his professional career, making his debut on 21 September 1988, in a friendly against the Soviet Union (1‚Äì0) in D√ºsseldorf. His other appearance took place in the final test of the nation ahead of the 1990 FIFA World Cup, playing nine minutes in another 1‚Äì0 success, on 30 May, against Denmark.

Callan Park is located in the suburb of Lilyfield on the border with Rozelle to the east. It is situated next to Iron Cove on the northern side. The NSW Office of Environment and Heritage manages a large part of the site on behalf of Health Administration Corporation, a division of NSW Health; with the other precincts managed by the Ambulance Service of New South Wales and the Sydney Local Health District. The popular Bay Run runs through the park along the foreshore of Iron Cove. History In 1839, Crown Solicitor and Police Magistrate John Ryan Brenan made a series of purchases to acquire the Callan Park land, which he named Garry Owen Estate. Brenan built a house on the land overlooking the Parramatta River, which he named Garry Owen house, and this was a local centre for social life until his bankruptcy in 1864. The land was purchased by Sydney businessman John Gordon who renamed the property Callan Park and subdivided the land ready for auction as a new waterfront suburb. The entire area was purchased by the Colonial Government as a site for a new lunatic asylum. The main complex was completed in 1885 and continued to be used for patients until 1994. Sydney College of the Arts took possession of the building in 1996. The precinct, including several individual buildings and historic rock carvings were listed on the NSW State Heritage Register in July 2008. In 1918 the Government of New South Wales purchased the house and land of Broughton Hall, Lilyfield, adjacent to the original \\"Callan Park\\" property. It was used as an army hospital during World War I.Map of Municipality of Leichhardt at Wikimedia Commons On 19 July 2011 Leichhardt Council (now Inner West Council) approved the Callan Park Master Plan, the Callan Park Conservation Management Plan and the Callan Park Plan of Management. The plans were submitted to the New South Wales State Government on 11 November 2011. In 2017 the Inner West Council called for \\"the long awaited adoption of its award-winning Callan Park Master Plan more than five years after it was first handed over to the State Government.\\" The former mayor of the council, Darcy Byrne, stated that the onus was on the State Government to act \\"before the erosion of facilities within Callan Park pass the point of no return.\\" He also stated that \\"with Sydney University vacating the Kirkbride complex local people will rightly be concerned that those magnificent sandstone buildings are about to become derelict.\\" In 2020, Sydney College of the Arts (SCA) moved from Callan Park to the main campus of Sydney University, taking up residence in the Old Teachers College building. Callan Park Hospital for the Insane The area was originally a private residence until it was purchased by the Colonial Government and transformed into a psychiatric hospital, known until 1914 as the Callan Park Hospital for the Insane. The facility remained in use until 1994 when it was relocated to new buildings on the site. After a period of extensive renovation, the Kirkbride Complex which housed the former hospital, was occupied by the Sydney College of the Arts. Broughton Hall Broughton Hall is a heritage-listed former residence, convalescent hospital and psychiatric clinic situated in Callan Park, The house, Broughton House or Broughton Hall, was built c. 1841 and variously served as a residence for prominent businessmen and public figures (1841-1914). It is situated within the Callan Park Conservation Area, in Church Street, Lilyfield, near the corner of Wharf Road. It was used as No. 13 Australian Army Hospital during World War I. Other buildings were constructed over time and the precinct was used as the Broughton Hall Psychiatric Clinic (1921-1976). It was merged into Rozelle Hospital along with the adjacent Callan Park Hospital for the Insane in 1976, during which time it became the first premises for the Rivendell Child, Adolescent and Family Unit. Broughton House fell into disuse, suffering severe damage from fire and vandalism.

It is situated in the valley of the River Burn, to the immediate west of Fearby. It is about three miles west of Masham in the Nidderdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. There are several holiday cottages and four Grade II Listed buildings, one of which is Healey Mill, a former corn mill. The civil parish includes Leighton Reservoir, the hamlet of Leighton, the hamlet of Gollinglith Foot in the lower part of Colsterdale and a large area of Masham Moor, a grouse moor, rising to the summit of Great Haw at the western extremity of the parish. The population of the parish was estimated at 100 in 2013. In the 2011 Census the population of the parish was included with the parishes of Colsterdale, Ellingstring and Ilton cum Pott, and not separately counted.  History  Healey was historically a township in the large ancient parish of Masham in the North Riding of Yorkshire. It became a separate ecclesiastical parish in 1849. The civil parish of Healey with Sutton was formed in 1866. Sutton consists of a few farms (High Sutton, Low Sutton, Sutton Penn and Sutton Grange) north-east of Healey, and was transferred to the parish of Ellington High and Low in 1886. In 1934 of the uninhabited Masham Moor (which had been common to the parishes of Masham and East Witton) were added to the civil parish, which was then renamed Healey.Vision of Britain: unit history of Healey with Sutton  Governance  Until 1974 Healey was part of Masham Rural District (before 1934 Masham Urban District) in the North Riding of Yorkshire. It is now part of the Borough of Harrogate in North Yorkshire. The parish now shares a grouped parish council, known as Fearby, Healey and District Parish Council, with Colsterdale, Fearby, Ellingstring and Ilton cum Pott.

Background The band was founded in 1995 by guitarist Peter van Elderen. He was joined by drummer Bart Nederhand and bass player Bob Muileboom in making their first self-titled album. After this album, Muileboom was replaced by Bart Geevers, who would stay to be a permanent member. The trio is known for their honest, no-nonsense rock n' roll songs and has a good reputation when it comes to live shows. They are often joined by guest singer and stage clown 'Dikke Dennis' (Fat Dennis). Peter Pan Speedrock has grown out to be an established name in the Dutch rock n' roll scene.

It was founded by Larry Krause in April 1973 and incorporated as Schenley Press, Inc. in 1976, when the paper adopted its present name. Its purpose is to air different points of view, with special focus on controversial stories. All of the paper's writers are free contributors. Over the years, it expanded to serve 27 different communities in Baltimore City, and fostered local writers and provided internships for high school and college students. In 2004, it had a circulation of about 28,000. In the early 1980s, the Chronicle added national and international reporting and commentary, seeking to supplement the news then locally available. In 1989, Krause and others established the nonprofit Baltimore News Network, Inc., which began publishing The Sentinel, a small newspaper that highlighted peace and social justice news and views and which, due to its nonprofit status, was able to obtain reprint permissions that were otherwise unavailable to the Chronicle. The Chronicle returned to its primarily local beat, carrying the Sentinel as an insert. In 1995, the Chronicle established its website. At first, this site mirrored the print reportage in the Chronicle and Sentinel; gradually the site began posting daily, becoming a far more extensive and timely source of news and views. In 2003, the Baltimore Chronicle was acquired by Baltimore News Network, Inc. and the print edition ceased. Others active during the long tenure of the newspaper include Alice Cherbonnier, its managing editor and wife of Larry Krause, and her brother, Marc Cherbonnier, the webmaster.

This was not the only attempt of its kind: the generalized hypergeometric function and the MacRobert E-function had the same aim, but Meijer's G-function was able to include those as particular cases as well. The first definition was made by Meijer using a series; nowadays the accepted and more general definition is via a line integral in the complex plane, introduced in its full generality by Arthur Erd√©lyi in 1953. With the modern definition, the majority of the established special functions can be represented in terms of the Meijer G-function. A notable property is the closure of the set of all G-functions not only under differentiation but also under indefinite integration. In combination with a functional equation that allows to liberate from a G-function G(z) any factor zœÅ that is a constant power of its argument z, the closure implies that whenever a function is expressible as a G-function of a constant multiple of some constant power of the function argument, f(x) = G(cxŒ≥), the derivative and the antiderivative of this function are expressible so too. The wide coverage of special functions also lends power to uses of Meijer's G-function other than the representation and manipulation of derivatives and antiderivatives. For example, the definite integral over the positive real axis of any function g(x) that can be written as a product G1(cxŒ≥)¬∑G2(dxŒ¥) of two G-functions with rational Œ≥/Œ¥ equals just another G-function, and generalizations of integral transforms like the Hankel transform and the Laplace transform and their inverses result when suitable G-function pairs are employed as transform kernels. A still more general function, which introduces additional parameters into Meijer's G-function, is Fox's H-function. Definition of the Meijer G-function A general definition of the Meijer G-function is given by the following line integral in the complex plane : : G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} a_1, \\\\dots, a_p \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_1, \\\\dots, b_q \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\pi i} \\\\int_L \\\\frac{\\\\prod_{j=1}^m \\\\Gamma(b_j - s) \\\\prod_{j=1}^n \\\\Gamma(1 - a_j +s)} {\\\\prod_{j=m+1}^q \\\\Gamma(1 - b_j + s) \\\\prod_{j=n+1}^p \\\\Gamma(a_j - s)} \\\\,z^s \\\\,ds, where Œì denotes the gamma function. This integral is of the so- called Mellin‚ÄìBarnes type, and may be viewed as an inverse Mellin transform. The definition holds under the following assumptions: * 0 ‚â§ m ‚â§ q and 0 ‚â§ n ‚â§ p, where m, n, p and q are integer numbers * ak ‚àí bj ‚â† 1, 2, 3, ... for k = 1, 2, ..., n and j = 1, 2, ..., m, which implies that no pole of any Œì(bj ‚àí s), j = 1, 2, ..., m, coincides with any pole of any Œì(1 ‚àí ak \\\\+ s), k = 1, 2, ..., n * z ‚â† 0 Note that for historical reasons the first lower and second upper index refer to the top parameter row, while the second lower and first upper index refer to the bottom parameter row. One often encounters the following more synthetic notation using vectors: : G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} a_1, \\\\dots, a_p \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_1, \\\\dots, b_q \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right) = G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right) . Implementations of the G-function in computer algebra systems typically employ separate vector arguments for the four (possibly empty) parameter groups a1 ... an, an+1 ... ap, b1 ... bm, and bm+1 ... bq, and thus can omit the orders p, q, n, and m as redundant. The L in the integral represents the path to be followed while integrating. Three choices are possible for this path: :1. L runs from ‚àíi‚àû to +i‚àû such that all poles of Œì(bj ‚àí s), j = 1, 2, ..., m, are on the right of the path, while all poles of Œì(1 ‚àí ak \\\\+ s), k = 1, 2, ..., n, are on the left. The integral then converges for arg z < Œ¥ œÄ, where :: \\\\delta = m + n - \\\\tfrac{1}{2} (p+q) ; :an obvious prerequisite for this is Œ¥ > 0. The integral additionally converges for arg z = Œ¥ œÄ ‚â• 0 if (q ‚àí p) (œÉ + 1‚ÅÑ2) > Re(ŒΩ) + 1, where œÉ represents Re(s) as the integration variable s approaches both +i‚àû and ‚àíi‚àû, and where :: u = \\\\sum_{j = 1}^q b_j - \\\\sum_{j = 1}^p a_j . :As a corollary, for arg z = Œ¥ œÄ and p = q the integral converges independent of œÉ whenever Re(ŒΩ) < ‚àí1. :2. L is a loop beginning and ending at +‚àû, encircling all poles of Œì(bj ‚àí s), j = 1, 2, ..., m, exactly once in the negative direction, but not encircling any pole of Œì(1 ‚àí ak \\\\+ s), k = 1, 2, ..., n. Then the integral converges for all z if q > p ‚â• 0; it also converges for q = p > 0 as long as z < 1\\\\. In the latter case, the integral additionally converges for z = 1 if Re(ŒΩ) < ‚àí1, where ŒΩ is defined as for the first path. :3. L is a loop beginning and ending at ‚àí‚àû and encircling all poles of Œì(1 ‚àí ak \\\\+ s), k = 1, 2, ..., n, exactly once in the positive direction, but not encircling any pole of Œì(bj ‚àí s), j = 1, 2, ..., m. Now the integral converges for all z if p > q ‚â• 0; it also converges for p = q > 0 as long as z > 1. As noted for the second path too, in the case of p = q the integral also converges for z = 1 when Re(ŒΩ) < ‚àí1. The conditions for convergence are readily established by applying Stirling's asymptotic approximation to the gamma functions in the integrand. When the integral converges for more than one of these paths, the results of integration can be shown to agree; if it converges for only one path, then this is the only one to be considered. In fact, numerical path integration in the complex plane constitutes a practicable and sensible approach to the calculation of Meijer G-functions. As a consequence of this definition, the Meijer G-function is an analytic function of z with possible exception of the origin z = 0 and of the unit circle z = 1. Differential equation The G-function satisfies the following linear differential equation of order max(p,q): : \\\\left[ (-1)^{p - m - n} \\\\;z \\\\prod_{j = 1}^p \\\\left( z \\\\frac{d}{dz} - a_j + 1 \\\\right) - \\\\prod_{j = 1}^q \\\\left( z \\\\frac{d}{dz} - b_j \\\\right) \\\\right] G(z) = 0. For a fundamental set of solutions of this equation in the case of p ‚â§ q one may take: : G_{p,q}^{\\\\,1,p} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} a_1, \\\\dots, a_p \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_h, b_1, \\\\dots, b_{h-1}, b_{h+1}, \\\\dots, b_q \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, (-1)^{p-m-n+1} \\\\;z \\\\right), \\\\quad h = 1,2,\\\\dots,q, and similarly in the case of p ‚â• q: : G_{p,q}^{\\\\,q,1} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} a_h, a_1, \\\\dots, a_{h-1}, a_{h+1}, \\\\dots, a_p \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_1, \\\\dots, b_q \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, (-1)^{q-m-n+1} \\\\;z \\\\right), \\\\quad h = 1,2,\\\\dots,p. These particular solutions are analytic except for a possible singularity at z = 0 (as well as a possible singularity at z = ‚àû), and in the case of p = q also an inevitable singularity at z = (‚àí1)p‚àím‚àín. As will be seen presently, they can be identified with generalized hypergeometric functions pFq‚àí1 of argument (‚àí1)p‚àím‚àín z that are multiplied by a power zbh, and with generalized hypergeometric functions qFp‚àí1 of argument (‚àí1)q‚àím‚àín z‚àí1 that are multiplied by a power zah‚àí1, respectively. Relationship between the G-function and the generalized hypergeometric function If the integral converges when evaluated along the second path introduced above, and if no confluent poles appear among the Œì(bj ‚àí s), j = 1, 2, ..., m, then the Meijer G-function can be expressed as a sum of residues in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions pFq‚àí1 (Slater's theorem): : G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right) = \\\\sum_{h=1}^m \\\\frac{\\\\prod_{j=1}^m \\\\Gamma(b_j - b_h)^* \\\\prod_{j=1}^n \\\\Gamma(1+b_h - a_j) \\\\; z^{b_h}} {\\\\prod_{j=m+1}^q \\\\Gamma(1+b_h - b_j) \\\\prod_{j=n+1}^p \\\\Gamma(a_j - b_h)} \\\\times : _{p}F_{q-1} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} 1+b_h - \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ (1+b_h - \\\\mathbf{b_q})^* \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, (-1)^{p-m-n} \\\\; z \\\\right) . The star indicates that the term corresponding to j = h is omitted. For the integral to converge along the second path one must have either p < q, or p = q and z < 1, and for the poles to be distinct no pair among the bj, j = 1, 2, ..., m, may differ by an integer or zero. The asterisks in the relation remind us to ignore the contribution with index j = h as follows: In the product this amounts to replacing Œì(0) with 1, and in the argument of the hypergeometric function, if we recall the meaning of the vector notation, : 1 + b_h - \\\\mathbf{b_q} = (1 + b_h - b_1), \\\\,\\\\dots, \\\\,(1 + b_h - b_j), \\\\,\\\\dots, \\\\,(1 + b_h - b_q), this amounts to shortening the vector length from q to q‚àí1. Note that when m = 0, the second path does not contain any pole, and so the integral must vanish identically, : G_{p,q}^{\\\\,0,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right) = 0, if either p < q, or p = q and z < 1\\\\. Similarly, if the integral converges when evaluated along the third path above, and if no confluent poles appear among the Œì(1 ‚àí ak \\\\+ s), k = 1, 2, ..., n, then the G-function can be expressed as: : G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right) = \\\\sum_{h=1}^n \\\\frac{\\\\prod_{j=1}^n \\\\Gamma(a_h - a_j)^* \\\\prod_{j=1}^m \\\\Gamma(1-a_h + b_j) \\\\; z^{a_h-1}} {\\\\prod_{j=n+1}^p \\\\Gamma(1-a_h + a_j) \\\\prod_{j=m+1}^q \\\\Gamma(a_h - b_j)} \\\\times : _{q}F_{p-1} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} 1-a_h + \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\\\\\\\\\ (1-a_h + \\\\mathbf{a_p})^* \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, (-1)^{q-m-n} z^{-1} \\\\right) . For this, either p > q, or p = q and z > 1 are required, and no pair among the ak, k = 1, 2, ..., n, may differ by an integer or zero. For n = 0 one consequently has: : G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,0} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right) = 0, if either p > q, or p = q and z > 1. On the other hand, any generalized hypergeometric function can readily be expressed in terms of the Meijer G-function: : \\\\; _{p}F_{q} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right) = \\\\frac {\\\\Gamma(\\\\mathbf{b_q})} {\\\\Gamma(\\\\mathbf{a_p})} \\\\; G_{p,\\\\,q+1}^{\\\\,1,\\\\,p} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} 1-\\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0,1 - \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, -z \\\\right) = \\\\frac {\\\\Gamma(\\\\mathbf{b_q})} {\\\\Gamma(\\\\mathbf{a_p})} \\\\; G_{q+1,\\\\,p}^{\\\\,p,\\\\,1} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} 1,\\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, -z^{-1} \\\\right), where we have made use of the vector notation: : \\\\Gamma(\\\\mathbf{a_p}) = \\\\prod_{j=1}^p \\\\Gamma(a_j). This holds unless a nonpositive integer value of at least one of its parameters ap reduces the hypergeometric function to a finite polynomial, in which case the gamma prefactor of either G-function vanishes and the parameter sets of the G-functions violate the requirement ak ‚àí bj ‚â† 1, 2, 3, ... for k = 1, 2, ..., n and j = 1, 2, ..., m from the definition above. Apart from this restriction, the relationship is valid whenever the generalized hypergeometric series pFq(z) converges, i. e. for any finite z when p ‚â§ q, and for z < 1 when p = q + 1. In the latter case, the relation with the G-function automatically provides the analytic continuation of pFq(z) to z ‚â• 1 with a branch cut from 1 to ‚àû along the real axis. Finally, the relation furnishes a natural extension of the definition of the hypergeometric function to orders p > q + 1. By means of the G-function we can thus solve the generalized hypergeometric differential equation for p > q + 1 as well. Polynomial cases To express polynomial cases of generalized hypergeometric functions in terms of Meijer G-functions, a linear combination of two G-functions is needed in general: : \\\\; _{p+1}F_{q} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} -h, \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right) = h! \\\\; \\\\frac{\\\\prod_{j=n+1}^p \\\\Gamma(1 - a_j) \\\\prod_{j=m+1}^q \\\\Gamma(b_j)} {\\\\prod_{j=1}^n \\\\Gamma(a_j) \\\\prod_{j=1}^m \\\\Gamma(1 - b_j)} \\\\times : \\\\left[ G_{p+1,\\\\,q+1}^{\\\\,m+1,\\\\,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} 1-\\\\mathbf{a_p}, h+1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0, 1-\\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, (-1)^{p-m-n} \\\\; z \\\\right) + (-1)^h \\\\; G_{p+1,\\\\,q+1}^{\\\\,m,\\\\,n+1} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} h+1, 1-\\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1-\\\\mathbf{b_q}, 0 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, (-1)^{p-m-n} \\\\; z \\\\right) \\\\right] , where h = 0, 1, 2, ... equals the degree of the polynomial p+1Fq(z). The orders m and n can be chosen freely in the ranges 0 ‚â§ m ‚â§ q and 0 ‚â§ n ‚â§ p, which allows to avoid that specific integer values or integer differences among the parameters ap and bq of the polynomial give rise to divergent gamma functions in the prefactor or to a conflict with the definition of the G-function. Note that the first G-function vanishes for n = 0 if p > q, while the second G-function vanishes for m = 0 if p < q. Again, the formula can be verified by expressing the two G-functions as sums of residues; no cases of confluent poles permitted by the definition of the G-function need be excluded here. Basic properties of the G-function As can be seen from the definition of the G-function, if equal parameters appear among the ap and bq determining the factors in the numerator and the denominator of the integrand, the fraction can be simplified, and the order of the function thereby be reduced. Whether the order m or n will decrease depends of the particular position of the parameters in question. Thus, if one of the ak, k = 1, 2, ..., n, equals one of the bj, j = m + 1, ..., q, the G-function lowers its orders p, q and n: : G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_p \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_1, \\\\dots, b_{q-1}, a_1 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right) = G_{p-1,\\\\,q-1}^{\\\\,m,\\\\,n-1} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} a_2, \\\\dots, a_p \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_1, \\\\dots, b_{q-1} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right), \\\\quad n,p,q \\\\geq 1. For the same reason, if one of the ak, k = n + 1, ..., p, equals one of the bj, j = 1, 2, ..., m, then the G-function lowers its orders p, q and m: : G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} a_1, \\\\dots, a_{p-1}, b_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_q \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right) = G_{p-1,\\\\,q-1}^{\\\\,m-1,\\\\,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} a_1, \\\\dots, a_{p-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_2, \\\\dots, b_q \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right), \\\\quad m,p,q \\\\geq 1. Starting from the definition, it is also possible to derive the following properties: : z^{\\\\rho} \\\\; G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right) = G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} + \\\\rho \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} + \\\\rho \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right), : G_{p+2,\\\\,q}^{\\\\,m,\\\\,n+1} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\alpha, \\\\mathbf{a_p}, \\\\alpha' \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right) = (-1)^{\\\\alpha'-\\\\alpha} \\\\; G_{p+2,\\\\,q}^{\\\\,m,\\\\,n+1} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\alpha', \\\\mathbf{a_p}, \\\\alpha \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right), \\\\quad n \\\\leq p, \\\\; \\\\alpha'-\\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}, : G_{p,\\\\,q+2}^{\\\\,m+1,\\\\,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\beta, \\\\mathbf{b_q}, \\\\beta' \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right) = (-1)^{\\\\beta'-\\\\beta} \\\\; G_{p,\\\\,q+2}^{\\\\,m+1,\\\\,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\beta', \\\\mathbf{b_q}, \\\\beta \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right), \\\\quad m \\\\leq q, \\\\; \\\\beta'-\\\\beta \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}, : G_{p+1,\\\\,q+1}^{\\\\,m,\\\\,n+1} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\alpha, \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q}, \\\\beta \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right) = (-1)^{\\\\beta-\\\\alpha} \\\\; G_{p+1,\\\\,q+1}^{\\\\,m+1,\\\\,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p}, \\\\alpha \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\beta, \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right), \\\\quad m \\\\leq q, \\\\; \\\\beta-\\\\alpha = 0,1,2,\\\\dots, : G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right) = G_{q,p}^{\\\\,n,m} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} 1-\\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1-\\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z^{-1} \\\\right), : G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right) = \\\\frac{h^{1+ u+(p-q)/2}} {(2 \\\\pi)^{(h-1) \\\\delta}} \\\\; G_{h p, \\\\, h q}^{\\\\, h m, \\\\, h n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} a_1/h, \\\\dots, (a_1+h-1)/h, \\\\dots, a_p/h, \\\\dots, (a_p+h-1)/h \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_1/h, \\\\dots, (b_1+h-1)/h, \\\\dots, b_q/h, \\\\dots, (b_q+h-1)/h \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, \\\\frac{z^h} {h^{h(q-p)}} \\\\right), \\\\quad h \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}. The abbreviations ŒΩ and Œ¥ were introduced in the definition of the G-function above. Derivatives and antiderivatives Concerning derivatives of the G-function, one finds these relationships: : \\\\frac{d}{dz} \\\\left[ z^{1-a_1} \\\\; G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right) \\\\right] = z^{-a_1} \\\\; G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} a_1 - 1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_p \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right), \\\\quad n \\\\geq 1, : \\\\frac{d}{dz} \\\\left[ z^{1-a_p} \\\\; G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right) \\\\right] =  z^{-a_p} \\\\; G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} a_1, \\\\dots, a_{p-1}, a_p - 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right), \\\\quad n < p. : \\\\frac{d}{dz} \\\\left[ z^{-b_1} \\\\; G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right) \\\\right] =  z^{-1-b_1} \\\\; G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_1 + 1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_q \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right), \\\\quad m \\\\geq 1, : \\\\frac{d}{dz} \\\\left[ z^{-b_q} \\\\; G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right) \\\\right] = z^{-1-b_q} \\\\; G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_1, \\\\dots, b_{q-1}, b_q + 1 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right), \\\\quad m < q, From these four, equivalent relations can be deduced by simply evaluating the derivative on the left-hand side and manipulating a bit. One obtains for example: : z \\\\frac{d}{dz} \\\\; G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right) = G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} a_1 -1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_p \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right) + (a_1 - 1) \\\\; G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right), \\\\quad n \\\\geq 1. Moreover, for derivatives of arbitrary order h, one has : z^h \\\\frac{d^h}{dz^h} \\\\; G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right) = G_{p+1,\\\\,q+1}^{\\\\,m,\\\\,n+1} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} 0, \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q}, h \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right) = (-1)^h \\\\; G_{p+1,\\\\,q+1}^{\\\\,m+1,\\\\,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p}, 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ h, \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right), : z^h \\\\frac{d^h}{dz^h} \\\\; G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z^{-1} \\\\right) = G_{p+1,\\\\,q+1}^{\\\\,m+1,\\\\,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p}, 1-h \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1, \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z^{-1} \\\\right) = (-1)^h \\\\; G_{p+1,\\\\,q+1}^{\\\\,m,\\\\,n+1} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} 1-h, \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q}, 1 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z^{-1} \\\\right), which hold for h < 0 as well, thus allowing to obtain the antiderivative of any G-function as easily as the derivative. By choosing one or the other of the two results provided in either formula, one can always prevent the set of parameters in the result from violating the condition ak ‚àí bj ‚â† 1, 2, 3, ... for k = 1, 2, ..., n and j = 1, 2, ..., m that is imposed by the definition of the G-function. Note that each pair of results becomes unequal in the case of h < 0\\\\. From these relationships, corresponding properties of the Gauss hypergeometric function and of other special functions can be derived. Recurrence relations By equating different expressions for the first- order derivatives, one arrives at the following 3-term recurrence relations among contiguous G-functions: : (a_p - a_1) \\\\; G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right) = G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} a_1-1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_p \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_1, \\\\dots, b_q \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right) + G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} a_1, \\\\dots, a_{p-1}, a_p-1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_1, \\\\dots, b_q \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right), \\\\quad 1 \\\\leq n < p, : (b_1 - b_q) \\\\; G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right) = G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} a_1, \\\\dots, a_p \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_1+1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_q \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right) + G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} a_1, \\\\dots, a_p \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_1, \\\\dots, b_{q-1}, b_q+1 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right), \\\\quad 1 \\\\leq m < q, : (b_1 - a_1 + 1) \\\\; G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right) = G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} a_1-1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_p \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_1, \\\\dots, b_q \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right) + G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} a_1, \\\\dots, a_p \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_1+1, b_2, \\\\dots, b_q \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right), \\\\quad n \\\\geq 1, \\\\; m \\\\geq 1, : (a_p - b_q - 1) \\\\; G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right) = G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} a_1, \\\\dots, a_{p-1}, a_p-1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_1, \\\\dots, b_q \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right) + G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} a_1, \\\\dots, a_p \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_1, \\\\dots, b_{q-1}, b_q+1 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right), \\\\quad n < p, \\\\; m < q. Similar relations for the diagonal parameter pairs a1, bq and b1, ap follow by suitable combination of the above. Again, corresponding properties of hypergeometric and other special functions can be derived from these recurrence relations. Multiplication theorems Provided that z ‚â† 0, the following relationships hold: : G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, w z \\\\right) = w^{b_1} \\\\sum_{h=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{(1 - w)^h}{h!} \\\\; G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_1+h, b_2, \\\\dots, b_q \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right), \\\\quad m \\\\geq 1, : G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, w z \\\\right) = w^{b_q} \\\\sum_{h=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{(w - 1)^h}{h!} \\\\; G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_1, \\\\dots, b_{q-1}, b_q+h \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right), \\\\quad m < q, : G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, \\\\frac{z}{w} \\\\right) = w^{1-a_1} \\\\sum_{h=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{(1 - w)^h}{h!} \\\\; G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} a_1-h, a_2, \\\\dots, a_p \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right), \\\\quad n \\\\geq 1, : G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, \\\\frac{z}{w} \\\\right) = w^{1-a_p} \\\\sum_{h=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{(w - 1)^h}{h!} \\\\; G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} a_1, \\\\dots, a_{p-1}, a_p-h \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right), \\\\quad n < p. These follow by Taylor expansion about w = 1, with the help of the basic properties discussed above. The radii of convergence will be dependent on the value of z and on the G-function that is expanded. The expansions can be regarded as generalizations of similar theorems for Bessel, hypergeometric and confluent hypergeometric functions. Definite integrals involving the G-function Among definite integrals involving an arbitrary G-function one has: : \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} x^{s - 1} \\\\; G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, \\\\eta x \\\\right) dx = \\\\frac{\\\\eta^{-s} \\\\prod_{j = 1}^{m} \\\\Gamma (b_j + s) \\\\prod_{j = 1}^{n} \\\\Gamma (1 - a_j - s)} {\\\\prod_{j = m + 1}^{q} \\\\Gamma (1 - b_j - s) \\\\prod_{j = n + 1}^{p} \\\\Gamma (a_j + s)}. Note that the restrictions under which this integral exists have been omitted here. It is, of course, no surprise that the Mellin transform of a G-function should lead back to the integrand appearing in the definition above. Euler-type integrals for the G-function are given by: : \\\\int_0^1 x^{-\\\\alpha} \\\\; (1-x)^{\\\\alpha - \\\\beta - 1} \\\\; G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z x \\\\right) dx = \\\\Gamma (\\\\alpha - \\\\beta) \\\\; G_{p+1 ,\\\\, q+1}^{\\\\,m ,\\\\, n+1} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\alpha, \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q}, \\\\beta \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right), : \\\\int_1^\\\\infty x^{-\\\\alpha} \\\\; (x-1)^{\\\\alpha - \\\\beta - 1} \\\\; G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z x \\\\right) dx = \\\\Gamma (\\\\alpha - \\\\beta) \\\\; G_{p+1 ,\\\\, q+1}^{\\\\,m+1 ,\\\\, n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p}, \\\\alpha \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\beta, \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right). Extensive restrictions under which these integrals exist can be found on p. 417 of \\"Tables of Integral Transforms\\", vol. II(1954), Edited by A. Erdelyi. Note that, in view of their effect on the G-function, these integrals can be used to define the operation of fractional integration for a fairly large class of functions (Erd√©lyi‚ÄìKober operators). A result of fundamental importance is that the product of two arbitrary G-functions integrated over the positive real axis can be represented by just another G-function (convolution theorem): : \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, \\\\eta x \\\\right) G_{\\\\sigma, \\\\tau}^{\\\\,\\\\mu, u} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{c_{\\\\sigma}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{d_\\\\tau} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, \\\\omega x \\\\right) dx = : = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\eta} \\\\; G_{q + \\\\sigma ,\\\\, p + \\\\tau}^{\\\\,n + \\\\mu ,\\\\, m + u} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} - b_1, \\\\dots, - b_m, \\\\mathbf{c_{\\\\sigma}}, - b_{m+1}, \\\\dots, - b_q \\\\\\\\\\\\ - a_1, \\\\dots, -a_n, \\\\mathbf{d_\\\\tau} , - a_{n+1}, \\\\dots, - a_p \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{\\\\eta} \\\\right) = : = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\omega} \\\\; G_{p + \\\\tau ,\\\\, q + \\\\sigma}^{\\\\,m + u ,\\\\, n + \\\\mu} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} a_1, \\\\dots, a_n, -\\\\mathbf{d_\\\\tau} , a_{n+1}, \\\\dots, a_p \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_1, \\\\dots, b_m, -\\\\mathbf{c_{\\\\sigma}}, b_{m+1}, \\\\dots, b_q \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\eta}{\\\\omega} \\\\right) . Restrictions under which the integral exists can be found in Meijer, C. S., 1941: Nederl. Akad. Wetensch, Proc. 44, pp. 82-92. Note how the Mellin transform of the result merely assembles the gamma factors from the Mellin transforms of the two functions in the integrand. The convolution formula can be derived by substituting the defining Mellin‚ÄìBarnes integral for one of the G-functions, reversing the order of integration, and evaluating the inner Mellin-transform integral. The preceding Euler-type integrals follow analogously. Laplace transform Using the above convolution integral and basic properties one can show that: : \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{- \\\\omega x} \\\\; x^{- \\\\alpha} \\\\; G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, \\\\eta x \\\\right) dx = \\\\omega^{\\\\alpha - 1} \\\\; G_{p + 1,\\\\,q}^{\\\\,m,\\\\,n+1} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\alpha, \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\eta}{\\\\omega} \\\\right) , where Re(œâ) > 0. This is the Laplace transform of a function G(Œ∑x) multiplied by a power x‚àíŒ±; if we put Œ± = 0 we get the Laplace transform of the G-function. As usual, the inverse transform is then given by: : x^{- \\\\alpha} \\\\; G_{p,\\\\,q+1}^{\\\\,m,\\\\,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q}, \\\\alpha \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, \\\\eta x \\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\pi i} \\\\int_{c - i \\\\infty}^{c + i \\\\infty} e^{\\\\omega x} \\\\; \\\\omega^{\\\\alpha - 1} \\\\; G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\eta}{\\\\omega} \\\\right) d\\\\omega, where c is a real positive constant that places the integration path to the right of any pole in the integrand. Another formula for the Laplace transform of a G-function is: : \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{- \\\\omega x} \\\\; G_{p,q}^{\\\\,m,n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, \\\\eta x^2 \\\\right) dx = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi} \\\\omega} \\\\; G_{p+2,\\\\,q}^{\\\\,m,\\\\,n+2} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} 0, \\\\frac{1}{2}, \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, \\\\frac{4 \\\\eta}{\\\\omega^2} \\\\right) , where again Re(œâ) > 0. Details of the restrictions under which the integrals exist have been omitted in both cases. Integral transforms based on the G-function In general, two functions k(z,y) and h(z,y) are called a pair of transform kernels if, for any suitable function f(z) or any suitable function g(z), the following two relationships hold simultaneously: : g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} k(z,y) \\\\, f(y) \\\\; dy, \\\\quad f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} h(z,y) \\\\, g(y) \\\\; dy. The pair of kernels is said to be symmetric if k(z,y) = h(z,y). Narain transform showed that the functions: : k(z,y) = 2 \\\\gamma \\\\; (zy)^{\\\\gamma - 1/2} \\\\; G_{p+q,\\\\,m+n}^{\\\\,m,\\\\,p} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p}, \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{c_m}, \\\\mathbf{d_n} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, (zy)^{2 \\\\gamma} \\\\right), : h(z,y) = 2 \\\\gamma \\\\; (zy)^{\\\\gamma - 1/2} \\\\; G_{p+q,\\\\,m+n}^{\\\\,n,\\\\,q} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} -\\\\mathbf{b_q}, -\\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\mathbf{d_n}, -\\\\mathbf{c_m} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, (zy)^{2 \\\\gamma} \\\\right) are an asymmetric pair of transform kernels, where Œ≥ > 0, n ‚àí p = m ‚àí q > 0, and: : \\\\sum_{j=1}^p a_j + \\\\sum_{j=1}^q b_j = \\\\sum_{j=1}^m c_j + \\\\sum_{j=1}^n d_j, along with further convergence conditions. In particular, if p = q, m = n, aj \\\\+ bj = 0 for j = 1, 2, ..., p and cj \\\\+ dj = 0 for j = 1, 2, ..., m, then the pair of kernels becomes symmetric. The well-known Hankel transform is a symmetric special case of the Narain transform (Œ≥ = 1, p = q = 0, m = n = 1, c1 = ‚àíd1 = ŒΩ‚ÅÑ2). Wimp transform showed that these functions are an asymmetric pair of transform kernels: : k(z,y) = G_{p+2,\\\\,q}^{\\\\,m,\\\\,n+2} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} 1 - u + i z, 1 - u - i z, \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\; y \\\\right), : h(z,y) = \\\\frac{i}{\\\\pi} y e^{- u \\\\pi i} \\\\left[ e^{\\\\pi y} A( u + i y, u - i y \\\\,\\\\, z e^{i \\\\pi} ) - e^{- \\\\pi y} A( u - i y, u + i y \\\\,\\\\, z e^{i \\\\pi} ) \\\\right], where the function A(¬∑) is defined as: : A(\\\\alpha, \\\\beta \\\\,\\\\, z) = G_{p+2,\\\\,q}^{\\\\,q-m,\\\\,p-n+1} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} -a_{n+1}, -a_{n+2}, \\\\dots, -a_p, \\\\alpha, -a_1, -a_2, \\\\dots, -a_n, \\\\beta \\\\\\\\\\\\ -b_{m+1}, -b_{m+2}, \\\\dots, -b_q, -b_1, -b_2, \\\\dots, -b_m \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, z \\\\right). Generalized Laplace transform The Laplace transform can be generalized in close analogy with Narain's generalization of the Hankel transform: : g(s) = 2 \\\\gamma \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} (st)^{\\\\gamma + \\\\rho - 1/2} \\\\; G_{p,\\\\,q+1}^{\\\\,q+1,\\\\,0} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0, \\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, (st)^{2 \\\\gamma} \\\\right) f(t) \\\\; dt, : f(t) = \\\\frac {\\\\gamma} {\\\\pi i} \\\\int_{c - i \\\\infty}^{c + i \\\\infty} (ts)^{\\\\gamma - \\\\rho - 1/2} \\\\; G_{p,\\\\,q+1}^{\\\\,1,\\\\,p} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\begin{matrix} -\\\\mathbf{a_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0, -\\\\mathbf{b_q} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\; \\\\right \\\\, -(ts)^{2 \\\\gamma} \\\\right) g(s) \\\\; ds, where Œ≥ > 0, p ‚â§ q, and: : (q+1-p) \\\\, {\\\\rho \\\\over 2 \\\\gamma} = \\\\sum_{j=1}^p a_j - \\\\sum_{j=1}^q b_j, and where the constant c > 0 places the second integration path to the right of any pole in the integrand. For Œ≥ = 1‚ÅÑ2, œÅ = 0 and p = q = 0, this corresponds to the familiar Laplace transform. Meijer transform Two particular cases of this generalization were given by C.S. Meijer in 1940 and 1941. The case resulting for Œ≥ = 1, œÅ = ‚àíŒΩ, p = 0, q = 1 and b1 = ŒΩ may be written : : g(s) = \\\\sqrt {2 / \\\\pi} \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} (st)^{1/2} \\\\, K_{ u}(st) \\\\, f(t) \\\\; dt, : f(t) = \\\\frac {1} {\\\\sqrt {2 \\\\pi} \\\\,i} \\\\int_{c - i \\\\infty}^{c + i \\\\infty} (ts)^{1/2} \\\\, I_{ u}(ts) \\\\, g(s) \\\\; ds, and the case obtained for Œ≥ = 1‚ÅÑ2, œÅ = ‚àím ‚àí k, p = q = 1, a1 = m ‚àí k and b1 = 2m may be written : : g(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} (st)^{-k-1/2} \\\\, e^{-st/2} \\\\, W_{k+1/2,\\\\,m}(st) \\\\, f(t) \\\\; dt, : f(t) = \\\\frac {\\\\Gamma(1-k+m)} {2 \\\\pi i \\\\, \\\\Gamma(1+2m)} \\\\int_{c - i \\\\infty}^{c + i \\\\infty} (ts)^{k-1/2} \\\\, e^{ts/2} \\\\, M_{k-1/2,\\\\,m}(ts) \\\\, g(s) \\\\; ds.

Although the unit's numerical designation was bestowed upon it during World War I, the unit can trace its origins back to 1860 when a Volunteer Rifle corps was raised in South Sydney. During World War I, the 19th Battalion was raised as a unit of the Australian Imperial Force, attached to the 5th Brigade, of the 2nd Division. The unit was formed in 1915 and was first sent to Gallipoli where it fought against the Turks, before being withdrawn from the peninsula and being sent to France in early 1916, where it served in the trenches along the Western Front. Over the next two years the battalion fought in many major battles and won numerous battle honours. In April 1918, it took part in defending against the German Spring Offensive, before the Allies launched their own last-ditch effort as part of the Hundred Days Offensive. The battalion was disbanded in October 1918 due to manpower shortages in the AIF and most of its men were sent to reinforce the other three battalions of the 5th Brigade. In 1921, the 19th Battalion was reformed as part of the Citizens Forces (later the \\"Militia\\"), becoming known as the 19th Battalion (The South Sydney Regiment). From 1930 the battalion was linked with the 1st Battalion to form the 1st/19th Battalion (City of Sydney's Own Regiment), before being linked with the 20th Battalion. During World War II the battalion initially served in the defence of Darwin before being delinked from the 20th Battalion in 1941 and deployed in New Guinea and New Britain. In 1945, the battalion was disbanded and was not reformed until 1966 when it was re-raised as part of the Citizens Military Force, serving as a special conditions battalion known as the 19th Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment. The battalion would maintain a similar role until 1995, although in 1971 it would be amalgamated with the 1st Battalion once more to form the 1st/19th Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment. History Early origins Like many Australian infantry battalions, the 19th Battalion's lineage is a complex one. As a result of a series of re-organisations, the battalion can trace its origins to 1860 when a corps of volunteers was raised in the southern suburbs of Sydney becoming known as \\"South Sydney's Own\\", a part of the military forces of the New South Wales colonial defence force. In 1903, following the Federation of Australia, this unit became part of the Commonwealth Military Forces and was subsumed into the 1st Australian Infantry Regiment. In 1912, a system of compulsory military service was introduced and the unit was renamed the 21st Infantry, and then later, in 1915, the 22nd Infantry. This scheme greatly expanded the army, however, when World War I began, due to the provisions of the Defence Act (1903) which precluded sending conscripts overseas to fight, it became necessary to raise an all volunteer force, separate to the home military force ‚Äì the Citizens Forces ‚Äì for service in the Middle East and Europe.. World War I This force was known as the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). As a part of this, the 19th Battalion was raised in March 1915, in Liverpool, New South Wales, drawing some of its personnel from men who had already served with the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force. Upon establishment the battalion was assigned to the 5th Brigade, which was part of the 2nd Division. After completing basic training in Australia, the battalion was dispatched to Egypt where further training was undertaken. Later, the battalion was sent to Anzac Cove as part of a wave of reinforcements that were sent to the peninsula following the initial landing,. arriving there on 21 August 1915. Following that, it took part in the attack on Battle of Hill 60, during which it was dispatched to the Azmak Dere, where a gap had formed following the British 11th Division's withdrawal amidst confused fighting.. Australian soldiers, including a runner from the 19th Battalion, at Broodseinde Ridge, October 1917 After this, the battalion was mainly employed in the defence of Pope's Hill, until it was withdrawn on 19 December 1915.. It returned to Egypt and was involved in the defence of the Suez Canal zone in the early months of 1916. The battalion was then sent to France. Arriving there on 22 March 1916, the battalion moved to the Armenti√®res area for familiarisation of trench warfare procedures on the Western Front, a completely different style of warfare to that encountered on Gallipoli. In July 1916, as part of the 2nd Division's relief of the 1st Division, the battalion arrived at Pozi√®res, where it took part in the Battle of Pozi√®res. In November 1916, following a period of respite in a quieter sector in Belgium, the 19th Battalion involved in an attack on a trench system known as \\"the Maze\\" near Flers, suffered devastating losses in winter conditions that were described as the \\"worst ever encountered by the AIF\\". In 1917, the 19th Battalion was involved in the attack on German forces after their retreat to the Hindenburg Line. The battalion also took part in three other major battles in 1917, Second Bullecourt, Menin Road and Poelcappelle in Belgium. In 1918 the battalion helped to repel the German Spring Offensive, and it was during this time, on 7 April 1918, that Lieutenant Percy Storkey earned a Victoria Cross for his actions during the fighting in Hangard Wood. Following this, the battalion took part in the Allied offensive that eventually brought about the end of the war, fighting around Amiens and Mont St Quentin before coming up against the \\"Beaurevoir Line\\" at Estrees on 3‚Äì4 October 1918. This engagement was the battalion's last combat operation in the war, as the whole of 2nd Division was withdrawn from the line after the 6th Brigade's attack on Montbrehain on 5‚Äì6 October. On 10 October 1918, while resting near Vignacourt, the 19th Battalion was disbanded in order to reinforce other battalions in the 5th Brigade.. During the war, the battalion suffered 2,903 casualties. There are 874 names of 19th Battalion personnel killed in action recorded on the Australian War Memorial (AWM) Roll of Honour. Members of the 19th Battalion received the following decorations: one Victoria Cross, five Distinguished Service Orders (DSOs), one Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), 20 Distinguished Conduct Medals (DCMs), 31 Military Crosses (MCs), 90 Military Medals (MMs), eight Meritorious Service Medals (MSMs) and 19 Mentions in Despatches (MIDs).The Australian War Memorial also states that there were six foreign awards, but does not list them. Matthews & Wilson have identified these awards which are shown with full details of recipients in their book's accompanying Research CD-ROM under \\"Decorations\\": one Order of St Stanislaus, 3rd Class, with Swords; one Croix de Guerre (France); two Croix de Guerre (Belgium); one M√©daille Militaire (France) and one Bronze Medal for Military Valour ('Al Valore') (Italy).This list has been put together using AWM figures, however, it differs slightly in so much as where a Bar was awarded, that is included in the figures. As such, there were 29 individuals who received the MC from the 19th Battalion, with two Bars. There were also 85 individuals who received the MM, with five Bars. For its war service, the battalion was awarded 20 battle honours. Inter-war years Officers from the 1st/19th Battalion, November 1932 Shortly before the end of World War I, Australia's home military force was re-organised into multi-battalion regiments, with each regiment being formed to perpetuate the numerical designations of the AIF battalions that had been raised from personnel drawn from their geographical area. In April 1921, following a review of Australia's defence requirements as the demobilisation process came to an end, the AIF was officially disbanded and the decision was made to reorganise the units of the Citizens Forces in order to perpetuate the designations and battle honours of the AIF battalions;. this saw the multi- battalion regiments disbanded and single battalions being formed. As a result, the 2nd Battalion, 19th Infantry Regiment, a unit that could trace its lineage back to 1860, was reformed as the 19th Battalion, perpetuating both the lineage of its predecessor Citizens Forces units and that of its associated AIF unit.. In 1927, the unit adopted the territorial designation of \\"The South Sydney Regiment\\". At the same time the motto Fortiter et Fideliter (Boldly and Faithfully) was authorised. The battalion was assigned to the 9th Brigade, 2nd Division, upon its re-establishment. Initially, the Citizens Force was maintained through a system of compulsory service, however, in 1929‚Äì30, after the election of the Scullin Labor government, the Citizens Force was reorganised as the \\"Militia\\",. and was maintained on a volunteer only basis.. Throughout the 1930s, as a result of manpower shortages and the austerity measures that resulted from the economic hardships of the Great Depression, the unit was amalgamated with the 1st Battalion. In 1939, these two battalions were delinked, however, the 19th was further amalgamated with the 20th Battalion to form the 20th/19th Battalion, adopting the territorial designation of the \\"Parramatta and Blue Mountains Regiment\\". World War II At the start of World War II, the 20th/19th Battalion served as a machine-gun unit. in Sydney before part of it was sent to Darwin to serve as a garrison force in 1941. The machine gunners later formed part of the 6th Machine Gun Battalion. Meanwhile, Darwin's regular garrison ‚Äì the Darwin Mobile Force ‚Äì was disbanded and as a consequence the battalion received a cadre of experience regular former non commissioned officers who were subsequently commissioned. Initially, this force was known as the Darwin Infantry Battalion, but from 1 November 1941 the title of the 19th Battalion was readopted with the unit having separated from the 20th.. During their time as part of the Darwin garrison, the 19th provided a significant part of the Army's contribution to the defence of the town against Japanese attacks; they remained there until September 1942 when they were relieved by troops from the 10th/48th Battalion, which had been transferred from the New South Wales south coast.. After their relief, the 19th was transported to Mt Isa and then flown back to Narellan where the troops were given a long period of leave.. Upon reconstitution in October, the battalion was re-equipped and a period of training around the Nepean River followed. Consisting of about 750 personnel, the 19th was reassigned to the 28th Brigade, along with the 20th and 34th Battalions. In November, the 19th moved to a training camp near Newcastle where they received amphibious training alongside US personnel to become a demonstration unit for the Joint Overseas Operational Training School. Afterwards, the battalion moved to Woodford, Queensland, where jungle training was undertaken. In April 1943, the 19th Battalion moved to Gordonvale and was reassigned to the 6th Brigade. In July it deployed to the Buna area in New Guinea where it was used on defensive duties carrying out patrols and providing labour for work parties.. In late May 1944, the battalion was transported aboard the Duntroon to Lae, establishing itself around Buolo.. alt=Two men wearing military style uniforms, one wearing a slouch hat, the other a general service cap, carrying weapons in a jungle setting In December 1944, the battalion was sent to New Britain, embarking upon the transport Francis J. Parkman,. and over the course of the next five months they undertook a campaign of harassment operations to keep the large number of Japanese forces stationed there off balance. Using barges to advance up the coast towards the Gazelle Peninsula, the 19th Battalion relieved the 14th/32nd Battalion and on 28 February 1945 crossed the Mevelo River,.. whereupon they began advancing towards the Wulwut River. At this point they came up against the forward Japanese defensive positions that had been dug-in along the Waitavalo ridge, which lay behind the Wulwut and overlooked the Waitavalo and Tol plantations. On 5 March, the 19th attempted to cross the river, but was initially turned back by intense Japanese mortar and machine-gun fire. A second attempt later in the day was successful, however... After this, the 19th subsequently captured a number of Japanese positions before moving on to Bacon Hill, the crest of the ridge where the main Japanese defensive position was located. At this point they were relieved by the 14th/32nd Battalion. After the 14th/32nd captured Bacon Hill further patrols were sent inland and towards Jammer Bay via the coast. The Australians subsequently secured a position along a line between Wide Bay and Open Bay, at which point they changed to a defensive posture, designed to keep the Japanese bottled up on the Gazelle Peninsula.. As a result, the battalion took no further part in major offensive operations. Throughout the fighting on New Britain, the 19th Battalion suffered 64 battle casualties, which consisted of seven officers and 57 other ranks.. In April 1945, the battalion was brought back to Australia in order to prepare for further operations. In July, however, as it became clear that the war was about to end the 19th was disbanded as it became surplus to Australia's military requirements. During the course of the war the battalion suffered a total of 69 casualties, of which 18 were killed in action or died on active service. Members of the battalion received the following decorations for their service: one OBE, four MCs, two MMs and 13 MIDs. The 19th Battalion was awarded three battle honours for its service during World War II; in 1961, it was also entrusted with the four battle honours that the 2/19th Battalion had received for its service during the Malayan Campaign and the Fall of Singapore. Post World War II Following the end of the war even though the Citizens Military Force (CMF) was reformed in 1948,. the battalion was not re-raised at the time. The CMF had been reformed on a restricted establishment and as a result the unit remained off the order of battle until 1966 when the 19th Battalion was re-raised as the 19th Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment, a special conditions battalion, assigned at divisional level to provide training for national servicemen and volunteers who were unable to meet their training obligations due to their residence in isolated areas. The battalion continued to fulfil a similar role until 1995, although in 1971 it was amalgamated with the 1st Battalion once more to form the 1st/19th Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment, an Australian Army Reserve unit that remains in existence today and perpetuates the honours and traditions of both the 1st and 19th Battalions and their predecessor units.

In 2008, he ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination in Texas's 22nd congressional district.  Personal life  Hrbacek attended the University of Houston at Clear Lake City and graduated with a bachelor's degree in accounting. He then attended the University of Houston where he received his Doctor of Jurisprudence degree from the University of Houston Law Center. Hrbacek is an attorney and a Certified Public Accountant (CPA). He has a law firm specializing in taxation, based in Sugar Land.  Mayor of Sugar Land  In 1996, while serving as a City Council member for Sugar Land's affluent District Four, which included a large part of the First Colony master-planned community including Sweetwater Country Club (the one-time home of the LPGA), Hrbacek decided to run for the mayor's office being vacated by incumbent Lee Duggan who was term limited from seeking re-election after serving a total of ten years. Sugar Land city officials are subject to four terms of two years each, which totals eight years of service, though a member may run for mayor after serving on Council. Hrbacek won the election and was re-elected for two subsequent terms. During the time that Hrbacek served as mayor and on City Council, Sugar Land was recognized andSugarlandtx.gov received multiple times for the quality of its management and innovative governance. The once sleepy company town grew into one of Houston's largest and most affluent suburbs as the city annexed several portions of First Colony, a large master-planned community that now comprises the vast majority of Sugar Land's southern area. The development of the Sugar Land Town Square, seen as a strong economic engine for Sugar Land, began during the late 1990s with Hrbacek playing a major role in the development of the project.Abouthechoices.com The establishment of the University of Houston System at Sugar Land, the creation of several regional parks, major economic growth, and the lowering the city property tax rate by over 30% were all highlights of his time in office.Aboutechoices.com  2002 mayoral campaign  In 2002, Hrbacek faced a tough re-election campaign for a fourth term against City Council member David Wallace, a businessman who had built up a base of support and had just been elected to the same City Council district Hrbacek held before becoming mayor. Wallace won the election after receiving the backing of several Republican leaders with whom he was allied in Fort Bend County and a local newspaper.  \\"Mayor Osama\\" controversy  Hrbacek's re-election bid was damaged by former conservative Houston radio talk show host Jon Matthews. Matthews hosted a radio talk show on KSEV. He endorsed Wallace and attacked Hrbacek through weekly newspaper columns in a local paper. Matthews referred to Hrbacek as \\"Mayor Osama\\" and \\"Dean Osama Hrbacek\\", a reference to terrorist, al-Qaida leader and suspected 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden. Columns attacking Hrbacek by both Mathews and the publisher of the paper, along with radio attacks, were made during the weeks before the May 2002 election campaign.Texnews.com Following the election, Hrbacek filed a lawsuit against Matthews and the newspaper publisher, B.K. Carter, over the comments, which claimed that the comments also damaged the reputation of Hrbacek's law firm. The lawsuit, filed in Fort Bend County District Court, Case ID 02-CV-127119, was dismissed.  Post-mayoral life  Hrbacek has served as a precinct chair for the Fort Bend County Republican Party, and has become one of the more high-profile precinct chairs in the county Republican establishment. Hrbacek has also served as the President of the Fort Bend Republican Club., and also served as a delegate and caucus official at Senatorial District and State Republican Conventions since 2000. Hrbacek was approached in 2006 by community leaders to consider running for the heavily Republican 26th District in the Texas House of Representatives, which comprises Sugar Land and several immediate areas such as the portion of the First Colony planned community in Missouri City. He decided that he would run at that time only if the incumbent Republican, Charlie Howard, chose not to run. When Howard indicated he would run in 2006,Fortbendnow.com [broken link] Hrbacek dropped out of the race.  Influence in 2006 congressional race (for Texas's 22nd congressional district)  Hrbacek served as a Precinct Chair delegate representing Fort Bend in the nomination process for the Republican write-in candidate to challenge Democratic ex-Congressman Nick Lampson and Libertarian Bob Smither in the general election to replace former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay. On April 3, 2006, DeLay decided not to seek re-election following an indictment related to campaign finances by District Attorney, Ronnie Earle, in Travis County. (As of February 2008, the case against DeLay is still pending.) Hrbacek was among the majority of Fort Bend Precinct Chairs who rejected efforts by Sugar Land Mayor David Wallace to become the Republican nominee in 2006. Republican precinct chairs from four counties, including Harris, Brazoria, and Galveston in addition to Fort Bend, later nominated dermatologist and Houston city councilwoman Shelley Sekula-Gibbs as a candidate in 2006. She won a special election to fill the remainder of DeLay's term but lost in the write in campaign for the general election by 10 points to Lampson who was on the ballot.  2008 Congressional race (Texas's 22nd District)  Following Nick Lampson's 2006 victory, Hrbacek was strongly encouraged to run against Lampson, given the latter's vulnerability in a heavily Republican district due to its strongly conservative nature. In fact, it was the most conservative district in the country that fell to a Democrat, having given George W. Bush a 2-to-1 margin of victory over Democratic candidate John Kerry in 2004. On October 4, 2007, Hrbacek formally announced his candidacy for Congress.  Media endorsements  Hrbacek has been endorsed by the Houston Chronicle, which praised his record as mayor and his support for expanded rail transit. He was also endorsed by the Fort Bend Independent.  Grassroots endorsements  Hrbacek's campaign has also been endorsed by a large number of grassroots leaders including over 40 precinct chairs and current and former elected officials across the district. Included among them are: State Republican Executive Committeewoman (SREC) District 17 - Terese Raia, Former SREC District 17 Committeeman - Tim Turner, Former Republican Party of Fort Bend County Chairman - Jim Stokes and Former Fort Bend County Judge - Mike Rozell. Former Sugar Land City Councilmembers from across the district have also endorsed Hrbacek. They include former Sugar Land Councilmembers Don Smithers, Brian Gaston and Mike Siweirka along with former Missouri City Councilmember Bob Burton.Republican Leaders And Former Elected Officials Endorsing Dean Hrbacek for Congress  Financial filings  As of February 29, 2008, Hrbacek's campaign is fourth with total fundraising at $266,086. This total includes a loan from Hrbacek to his campaign of $113,000. In the October 2007 filing,F.E.C. IMAGE 27991065077 (Page 1 of 66) the Hrbacek Campaign reported net contributions of $109,195 ranking his campaign fourth in 3rd quarter contributions. In the 2007 Year End filing,F.E.C. IMAGE 28990247225 (Page 1 of 55) the Hrbacek campaign reported net contributions of $37,592 which was sixth most for the quarter. In the Pre-Primary filingF.E.C. IMAGE 28990514127 (Page 1 of 23) covering 1 January through February 13, the Hrbacek campaign collected $6,299, which ranked eighth among all candidates filing. The Hrbacek Campaign has made an effort to collect contributions from within the boundaries of Texas Congressional District 22 and with the exception of Political Action Committees, did not accept or solicit large contributions from lobbyists, D.C. insiders and special interests outside of CD 22.  Photoshop controversy  On January 19, 2008 a mailer containing a photo that was presented as a true image of Hrbacek was in reality a computerized composite of Hrbacek's face and someone else's slimmer figure, in suit and tie, from neck to knee. It made international news.  Election results  In the 2008 Republican primary, Hrbacek collected 10.5 percent of the vote to finish in fifth place.2008 Republican Party Primary Election - Results  References   External links  * 2008 Congressional campaign website * Former mayor files suit against media personality Year of birth missing (living people) Living people American accountants People from Sugar Land, Texas Texas lawyers Mayors of places in Texas University of Houston alumni University of Houston‚ÄìClear Lake alumni Texas Republicans ","title":"Dean A.

During the 1984‚Äì85 school years the roads connecting the school to Relation Street and to 20th Ave were completed. In 1986 a bond issue passed that allowed for the cafeteria, orchestra pit, and shop building that connects the gym and main building to be built. It also approved the construction of the current football stadium and track. Until that time there was no cafeteria, just a snack bar, all of the shop students still had to go over to the junior high, and all home track meets were at EAC. All of these new facilities were opened by the 1987‚Äì88 school year. It was in this year the current bus barn was added. Then in 1990 the current baseball stadium and tennis courts were developed and later softball fields were developed when that sport was added. In the late 1990s the road connecting the school to Eighth Street was completed. In 2000 the new second gym and wrestling rooms was added to the building.

It was first publicly displayed at the Interpolytech-2004 exhibition in Moscow even though its patent was filed in 2001 and issued in 2003.  Overview  The PP-2000 is a conventional blowback-operated weapon and weighs 1.5 kg (3.3 lb) empty. The PP-2000 is designed as a close-quarter combat weapon, intended for riot police and special operations forces. In 2008, it was adopted as one of the two standard SMGs of the Russian police (along with the Vityaz- SN).http://inmoscowsshadows.wordpress.com/2008/10/23/new-guns-for-russias- cops-so-what/  Design  It is chambered in 9√ó19mm Parabellum, and specifically designed to utilize the new Russian 9√ó19mm 7N21 and 7N31 (Cyrillic: 7–ù21 and 7–ù31) +P+ armor-piercing versions of the cartridge. This is intended to give the PP-2000 armor-piercing capability comparable to the FN P90 and Heckler & Koch MP7 personal defense weapons while also being able to use common 9mm Parabellum rounds. One unusual feature is the ability to store a spare 44-round magazine at the rear of the gun, where it also functions as a stock. A wire folding stock is also available. Another unusual feature is that this firearm's charging handle is located directly behind the front sight and folds out of the way when not in use.

Raised in early 1915 as part of the Australian Imperial Force, it was attached to the 5th Brigade, 2nd Division that served during World War I. The battalion first saw action during the Gallipoli campaign, before being evacuated in December 1915. After that the 20th Battalion was sent to France where they served in the trenches along the Western Front. Over the course of the next two years, they fought in many major battles, including the battles of the Hundred Days Offensive at the end of the war. The 20th Battalion's last engagement was at Montbrehain in October 1918. Following the end of the war, it was disbanded in April 1919. It was later re-raised in 1921, although it was amalgamated in 1929 due to manpower shortages. During World War II the battalion was briefly re-raised and carried out garrison duties in Australia. History World War I The 20th Battalion was raised in March 1915 in Liverpool, New South Wales, as part of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). A small number of its original recruits had already served with the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force in New Guinea in 1914. After undertaking initial training, the battalion left Australia in June and after a further period of training in Egypt they landed at Anzac Cove on 22 August 1915 as part of the 5th Brigade, 2nd Division. They played only a minor part in the fighting during the August Offensive which was coming to a close by the time they arrived and so for the majority of time that they were at Gallipoli, the battalion was deployed in the defence of Russell's Top. They remained on the peninsula until the evacuation on 20 December 1915. Walter Brown, who received the Victoria Cross following the fighting around Villers-Bretonneux, July 1918 Following further training in Egypt, the 20th Battalion was sent to France, arriving there on 22 March 1916. From there it proceeded to a position near Pozi√®res, where it took up position in the trenches in April and, a month later, had the dubious honour of being the first Australian battalion to be raided by the Germans. Later, in July and August the 20th took part in the Battle of Pozi√®res, during which time it served in the line twice before moving to a quieter sector in Belgium for a period of rest. In October, however, the entire 2nd Division was moved to the south again and put back into the line in France once again and in November they launched an attack at Flers, in conditions that were so muddy that they were described by the official historian, Charles Bean, as \\"the worst ever encountered by the AIF\\". Throughout 1917 the 20th Battalion was involved in three major battles as the German Army was forced back towards the Hindenburg Line, seeing action at Bullecourt in May, Menin Road in September and Poelcappelle in October. At Lagnicourt, on 15 April, along with other units from the 5th Brigade, they took part in a defensive action along with four other battalions, where they managed to defeat a counter-attack by a German force almost five times its size. In 1918, the battalion was involved in repelling the German Spring Offensive, when the 20th was one of many Australian battalions that were hurried in to the line to stop it, and on 7 April 1918, they took part in a very sharp engagement at Hangard Wood. Once the German offensive was defeated, the Allies launched their own, known as the Hundred Days Offensive which eventually brought about an end to the war. During this time the 20th were involved in the battles at Amiens and Mont St Quentin in August, before participating in the attack on the \\"Beaurevoir Line\\" at Montbrehain in October. This would be the battalion's last contribution to the war, as it was training out of the line when the Armistice was declared in November 1918. It was disbanded on 20 April 1919 while at Montigny-le-Tilluel, Belgium, when most of its personnel, including the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Forbes, were marched out for repatriation to Australia as part of the demobilisation process. During the war, the 20th Battalion lost 848 men killed and 3,143 men wounded. The battalion's sole Victoria Cross recipient was Walter Brown, who received the decoration for his actions around Villers-Bretonneux on 6 July 1918. For the battalion's involvement in the war, it received a total of 20 battle honours. Inter war years and World War II In 1921, Australia's part-time military force, the Citizens Force (later known as the Militia), was re-organised to perpetuate the numerical designations and structure of the AIF.Grey 2008, p. 125. At this time the 20th Battalion was re-raised in New South Wales, around Parramatta, and was again placed under the command of the 5th Brigade, 2nd Division. Upon formation, the new 20th Battalion drew personnel from the 20th Infantry Regiment, and through this link it inherited two battle honours: \\"Suakin 1885\\" and \\"South Africa 1899‚Äì1902\\".Festberg 1972, pp. 81‚Äì82. Territorial designations were introduced in 1927, at which point the battalion adopted the title of the \\"Paramatta and Blue Mountains Regiment\\"; at the same time the motto of Pro Patria was approved.Festberg 1972, p. 82. In 1929, following the suspension of the compulsory training scheme by the newly elected Scullin Labor government,Grey 2008, p. 138. financial pressures and manpower shortages resulted in a number of battalions being amalgamated.Keogh 1965, p. 44. The 20th Battalion was one of those chosen, and it merged with the 54th, although they were later delinked. An alliance with the Lancashire Fusiliers was approved in 1937. In 1939, the 20th Battalion merged with the 19th Battalion to become the 20th/19th Battalion, adopting the territorial designation of the \\"Parramatta and Blue Mountains Regiment\\". Following the outbreak of World War II, the 20th/19th Battalion was transferred from Sydney to Darwin in the Northern Territory, where they were to form part of the town's garrison. These two battalions were delinked on 1 November 1941 as part of the expansion of the Australian military following Japan's entry into the war. The 20th/19th Battalion's machine gunners later formed part of the 6th Machine Gun Battalion.Morgan 2019, p. 5. At the split, the 20th Battalion was assigned once again to the 5th Brigade, although in February 1942 they were transferred to the 28th Brigade. With the 28th Brigade, the 20th Battalion undertook defensive duties around Port Kembla and Seaham in New South Wales.McKenzie- Smith 2018, p. 2111. Nevertheless, as a result of a manpower shortage in the Australian economy, the government decided to disband or amalgamate a number of Militia units throughout 1942‚Äì43,Grey 2008, pp. 183‚Äì184. and on 13 December 1943, the 20th merged with the 34th to form the 20th/34th Battalion. This unit remained in existence until it was disbanded on 6 April 1944. Although the 20th Battalion received no battle honours for direct involvement in combat during World War II, in 1961 it was entrusted with the three battle honours bestowed upon the 2/20th Battalion for their involvement in the Malayan Campaign. Battle honours For its service during the war, the 20th Battalion received the following battle honours: *Suakin 1885 (inherited); *South Africa 1899‚Äì1902 (inherited); * World War I: Suvla, Gallipoli 1915‚Äì16, Egypt 1915‚Äì16, Somme 1916‚Äì18, Pozi√®res, Bapaume 1917, Bullecourt, Ypres 1917, Menin Road, Polygon Wood, Broodseinde, Poelcappelle, Passchendaele, Hamel, Amiens, Albert 1918, Mont St Quentin, Hindenburg Line, Beaurevoir, France and Flanders 1916‚Äì18. *World War II: Malaya 1941‚Äì42, Johore, Singapore Island (inherited).

The other two were Vishnu Deo and James Ramchandar Rao. Singh was a landlord from Ba and undertook several business ventures which included publishing newspapers. Biography Parmanand Singh was born in Yalalevu in the Ba District of Fiji in 1905. His parents had come to Fiji as indentured labourers and prospered in the opportunities available after indenture. He was educated at Auckland College, graduating in 1923. While in New Zealand, he played rugby, a game rarely played by Fiji Indians. On his return to Fiji, he took advantage of a business opportunity by leasing land from Colonial Sugar Refining Company (CSR) and sub-leasing it to small farmers. Like most rich farmers from Ba, he joined the Arya Samaj and was chosen by Vishnu Deo to contest the Northern & Western Division in the 1929 general elections, the first in which Indo- Fijians were allowed to vote.1929 Fiji Legislative Council elections Fiji Elections He won easily with the support of Deo and the Arya Samaj, an organisation to which most educated Fiji Indians belonged. However, two weeks after being sworn in he and the two other Indo-Fijians representatives resigned when a motion asking for equal political rights for Indo-Fijians was defeated. He was opposed to the immigration of Punjabis and Gujaratis, a cause later taken up by his brother, Chattur Singh who was later also a member of the Legislative Council. In 1948, he left for India for the education of his children and returned 3 years later. He saw opportunities in the printing industry and established a printing press in Ba, which he used to publish a newspaper, Awaaz (The Voice) in the Hindi language. He was unable to keep the newspaper in circulation due to a natural disaster and poor staff. He then moved to Lautoka and in 1956, started publishing another newspaper, Jai Fiji, which remained in circulation until 1980. The family involvement in Fijian politics has continued with his son, Anand Singh, also serving in the House of Representatives and Senate and as the Attorney General of Fiji in the Fiji Labour Party government of Mahendra Chaudhry from 1999 to 2000.

Under the principles of vapor compression refrigeration, an ASHP uses a refrigerant system involving a compressor and a condenser to absorb heat at one place and release it at another. They can be used as a space heater or cooler, and are sometimes called \\"reverse-cycle air conditioners\\". In domestic heating use, an ASHP absorbs heat from outside air and releases it inside the building, as hot air, hot water-filled radiators, underfloor heating and/or domestic hot water supply. The same system can often do the reverse in summer, cooling the inside of the house. When correctly specified, an ASHP can offer a full central heating solution and domestic hot water up to 80 ¬∞C. Description Air at any temperature above absolute zero contains some energy. An air source heat pump transfers some of this energy as heat from one place to another, for example between the outside and inside of a building. This can provide space heating and hot water. A single system can be designed to transfer heat in either direction, to heat or cool the interior of the building in winter and summer respectively. For simplicity, the description below focuses on use for interior heating. The technology is similar to a refrigerator or freezer or air conditioning unit: the different effect is due to the physical location of the different system components. Just as the pipes on the back of a refrigerator become warm as the interior cools, so an ASHP warms the inside of a building whilst cooling the outside air. The main components of an air source heat pump are: * An outdoor heat exchanger coil, which extracts heat from ambient air * An indoor heat exchanger coil, which transfers the heat into hot air ducts, an indoor heating system such as water-filled radiators or underfloor circuits and a domestic hot water tank. Air source heat pumps can provide fairly low cost space heating. A high efficiency heat pump can provide up to four times as much heat as an electric resistance heater using the same amount of electricity. The lifetime cost of an air source heat pump will be affected by the price of electricity compared to gas (where available). Burning gas or oil will emit carbon dioxide and also nitrogen dioxide, which can be harmful to health. An air source heat pump issues no carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide or any other kind of gas. It uses a small amount of electricity to transfer a large amount of heat: the electricity may be from a renewable source, or it may be generated from power stations which burn fossil fuel. A \\"standard\\" domestic air source heat pump can extract useful heat down to about . At colder outdoor temperatures the heat pump is less efficient; it could be switched off and the premises heated using only supplemental heat (or emergency heat) if the supplemental heating system is large enough. There are specially designed heat pumps that, while giving up some performance in cooling mode, will provide useful heat extraction to even lower outdoor temperatures. In cold climates An air source heat pump designed specifically for very cold climates can extract useful heat from ambient air as cold ‚àí30 ¬∞C (‚àí22 ¬∞F). Manufacturers include Mitsubishi and Fujitsu. One Mitsubishi model provides heat at ‚àí35 ¬∞C, but the coefficient of performance (COP) drops to 0.9, indicating that resistance heating would be more efficient at that temperature. At ‚àí30 ¬∞C, the COP is 1.1, according to the manufacturer's data, although the manufacturer's marketing literature also claims a minimum COP of 1.4 and performance to ‚àí30 ¬∞C. Although air source heat pumps are less efficient than well-installed ground source heat pumps in cold conditions, air source heat pumps have lower initial costs and may be the most economic or practical choice. A study by Natural Resources Canada found that cold climate air source heat pumps (CC-ASHPs) do work in Canadian winters, based on testing in Ottawa, Ontario in late December 2012 to early January 2013 using a ducted CC-ASHP. (The report does not explicitly state whether backup heat sources should be considered for temperatures below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The record low for Ottawa is ‚àí36 ¬∞C.) The CC-ASHP provided 60% energy (though not energy cost) savings compared to natural gas, when considering only energy efficiency in the home. When considering energy efficiency in electricity generation however, more energy would be used with the CC-ASHP, relative to natural gas heating, in provinces or territories (Alberta, Nova Scotia, and the Northwest Territories) where coal-fired generation was the predominant method of electricity generation. (The energy savings in Saskatchewan were marginal. Other provinces use primarily hydroelectric and/or nuclear generation.) Despite the significant energy savings relative to gas in provinces not relying primarily on coal, the higher cost of electricity relative to natural gas (using 2012 retail prices in Ottawa, Ontario) made natural gas the less expensive energy source. (The report did not calculate the cost of operation in the province of Quebec, which has lower electricity rates, nor did it show the impact of time of use electricity rates.) The study found that in Ottawa a CC-ASHP cost 124% more to operate than the natural gas system. However, in areas where natural gas is not available to homeowners, 59% energy cost savings can be realized relative to heating with fuel oil. The report noted that about 1 million residences in Canada (8%) are still heated with fuel oil. The report shows 54% energy cost savings for CC-ASHPs relative to electric baseboard resistance heating. Based on these savings, the report showed a five-year payback for converting from either fuel oil or electric baseboard resistance heating to a CC-ASHP. (The report did not specify whether that calculation considered the possible need for an electrical service upgrade in the case of converting from fuel oil. Presumably no electrical service upgrade would be needed if converting from electric resistance heat.) The report did note greater fluctuations in room temperature with the heat pump due to its defrost cycles. Longevity Air source heat pumps can last for over 20 years with low maintenance requirements. There are numerous heat pumps from the 1970s and 1980s in the United States that are still in service in 2012, even in places where winters are extremely cold. Few moving parts reduce maintenance requirements. However, the outdoor heat exchanger and fan must be kept free from leaves and debris. Heat pumps have more moving parts than an equivalent electric resistance heater or fuel burning heater. Ground source heat pumps have fewer moving parts than air source heat pumps as they do not need fans or defrosting mechanisms and are located indoors. The ground array for a ground source installation should last for over 100 years. Usage Air source heat pumps are used to provide interior space heating and cooling even in colder climates, and can be used efficiently for water heating in milder climates. A major advantage of some ASHPs is that the same system may be used for heating in winter and cooling in summer. Though the cost of installation is generally high, it is less than the cost of a ground source heat pump, because a ground source heat pump requires excavation to install its ground loop. The advantage of a ground source heat pump is that it has access to the thermal storage capacity of the ground which allows it to produce more heat for less electricity in cold conditions. ASHPs are often paired with auxiliary or emergency heat systems to provide backup heat when outside temperatures are too low for the pump to work efficiently, or in the event the pump malfunctions. Since ASHPs have high capital costs, and efficiency drops as temperature decreases, it is generally not cost-effective to size a system for the coldest possible temperature scenario, even if an ASHP could meet the entire heat requirement at the coldest temperatures expected. Propane, natural gas, oil or pellet fuel furnaces can provide this supplementary heat. All- electric heat pump systems have an electric furnace or electric resistance heat, or strip heat, which typically consists of rows of electric coils that heat up. A fan blows over the heated coils and circulates warm air throughout the home. This serves as an adequate heating source, but as temperatures go down, electricity costs rise. Electrical service outages pose the same threat as to central forced-air systems and pump-based boilers, but woodstoves and non-electric fireplace inserts can mitigate this risk. Some ASHPs can be coupled to solar panels as primary energy source, with a conventional electric grid as backup source. Thermal storage solutions incorporating resistance heating can be used in conjunction with ASHPs. Storage may be more cost- effective if time of use electricity rates are available. Heat is stored in high density ceramic bricks contained within a thermally-insulated enclosure. ASHPs may also be paired with passive solar heating. Thermal mass (such as concrete or rocks) heated by passive solar heat can help stabilize indoor temperatures, absorbing heat during the day and releasing heat at night, when outdoor temperatures are colder and heat pump efficiency is lower. The outdoor section on some units may 'frost up' when there is sufficient moisture in the air and outdoor temperature is between 0 ¬∞C and 5 ¬∞C (32 ¬∞F to 41 ¬∞F). This restricts air flow across the outdoor coil. These units employ a defrost cycle where the system switches temporarily to 'cooling' mode to move heat from the home to the outdoor coil to melt the ice. This requires the supplementary heater (resistance electric or gas) to activate. The defrost cycle reduces the efficiency of the heat pump significantly, although the newer (demand) systems are more intelligent and need to defrost less. As temperatures drop below freezing the tendency for frosting of the outdoor section decreases due to reduced humidity in the air. It is difficult to retrofit conventional heating systems that use radiators/radiant panels, hot water baseboard heaters, or even smaller diameter ducting, with ASHP-sourced heat. The lower heat pump output temperatures would mean radiators would have to be increased in size or a low temperature underfloor heating system be installed instead. Alternatively, a high temperature heat pump can be installed and existing heat emitters can be retained. Technology A: indoor compartment, B: outdoor compartment, I: insulation, 1: condenser, 2: expansion valve, 3: evaporator, 4: compressor Heating and cooling is accomplished by pumping a refrigerant through the heat pump's indoor and outdoor coils. Like in a refrigerator, a compressor, condenser, expansion valve and evaporator are used to change states of the refrigerant between colder liquid and hotter gas states. When the liquid refrigerant at a low temperature and low pressure passes through the outdoor heat exchanger coils, ambient heat causes the liquid to boil (change to gas or vapor): heat energy from the outside air has been absorbed and stored in the refrigerant as latent heat. The gas is then compressed using an electric pump; the compression increases the temperature of the gas. Inside the building, the gas passes through a pressure valve into heat exchanger coils. There, the hot refrigerant gas condenses back to a liquid and transfers the stored latent heat to the indoor air, water heating or hot water system. The indoor air or heating water is pumped across the heat exchanger by an electric pump or fan. The cool liquid refrigerant then re-enter the outdoor heat exchanger coils to begin a new cycle. Most heat pumps can also operate in a cooling mode where the cold refrigerant is moved through the indoor coils to cool the room air. Efficiency ratings The 'Efficiency' of air source heat pumps is measured by the coefficient of performance (COP). A COP of 3 means the heat pump produces 3 units of heat energy for every 1 unit of electricity it consumes. Within temperature ranges of ‚àí3 ¬∞C to 10 ¬∞C, the COP for many machines is fairly stable at 3‚Äì3.5. In very mild weather, the COP of an air source heat pump can be up to 4. However, on a cold winter day, it takes more work to move the same amount of heat indoors than on a mild day.Efficiency of heat pumps in changing conditions, http://www.icax.co.uk/Air_Source_Heat_Pumps.html The heat pump's performance is limited by the Carnot cycle and will approach 1.0 as the outdoor-to-indoor temperature difference increases, which for most air source heat pumps happens as outdoor temperatures approach ‚àí18 ¬∞C / 0 ¬∞F. Heat pump construction that enables carbon dioxide as a refrigerant may have a COP of greater than 2 even down to ‚àí20 ¬∞C, pushing the break-even figure downward to ‚àí30 ¬∞C (‚àí22 ¬∞F). A ground source heat pump has comparatively less of a change in COP as outdoor temperatures change, because the ground from which they extract heat has a more constant temperature than outdoor air. The design of a heat pump has a considerable impact on its efficiency. Many air source heat pumps are designed primarily as air conditioning units, mainly for use in summer temperatures. Designing a heat pump specifically for the purpose of heat exchange can attain greater COP and an extended life cycle. The principal changes are in the scale and type of compressor and evaporator. Seasonally adjusted heating and cooling efficiencies are given by the heating seasonal performance factor (HSPF) and seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER) respectively. In units charged with HFC refrigerants, the COP is reduced when heat pumps are used to heat domestic water to over 60 ¬∞C or to heat conventional central heating systems that use radiators to distribute heat (instead of an underfloor heating array). Risks and precautions *Conventional air source heat pumps lose their capacity as the external temperatures fall below 5 degrees Celsius (about 41 degrees Fahrenheit). CC-ASHPs (see above) may operate efficiently in temperatures as low as ‚àí30C, although they may not be as efficient in cooling during the summer season as conventional air source heat pumps. If a conventional air source heat pump is used in colder climates, the system needs an auxiliary source of heat to supplement the heat pump in the event of extremely cold temperatures or when it is simply too cold for the heat pump to work at all. *An Auxiliary Heat/Emergency Heat system, for example a traditional furnace, is also important if the heat pump is malfunctioning or being repaired. In colder climates, split-system heat pumps matched with gas, oil or pellet fuel furnaces will work even in extremely cold temperatures. Controversy Units charged with HFC refrigerants are often marketed as low energy or a sustainable technology, however if the HFC leaks out from the system, there is potential to contribute to global warming, as measured in global warming potential (GWP) and ozone depletion potential (ODP). Recent government mandates have seen the phase-out of R-22 refrigerant and its replacement with more environmentally sound R-410A refrigerant. Impact on electric utilities While heat pumps with backup systems other than electrical resistance heating are often encouraged by electric utilities, air source heat pumps are a concern for winter-peaking utilities if electrical resistance heating is used as the supplemental or replacement heat source when the temperature drops below the point that the heat pump can meet all of the home's heat requirement. Even if there is a non-electric backup system, the fact that efficiencies of ASHPs decrease with outside temperatures is a concern to electric utilities. The drop in efficiency means their electrical load increases steeply as temperatures drop. A study in Canada's Yukon Territory, where diesel generators are used for peaking capacity, noted that widespread adoption of air source heat pumps could lead to increased diesel consumption if the increased electrical demand due to ASHP use exceeds available hydroelectric capacity. Notwithstanding those concerns, the study did conclude that ASHPs are a cost-effective heating alternative for Yukon residents. As wind farms are increasingly used to supply electricity to the grid, the increased winter load matches well with the increased winter generation from wind turbines, and calmer days result in decreased heating load for most houses even if the air temperature is low.

Credit: Colin Smith Formerly called \\"Toon o' Firth\\", the origin of the Finstown name is thought to come from an Irishman named David Phin who came to the area in 1811. A soldier with the 9th Royal Veteran Battalion, he married a Kirkwall girl in 1813. In 1820, he opened an ale-house which was called the Toddy Hole by arrangement with John Miller of Millquoy. Four years later they quarrelled and Phin left for Aberdeen, but his name remained. The ale-house building is now the site of the Pomona Inn hostelry, after an old name for Mainland Orkney. The former Liberal Party leader Jo Grimond is buried in Finstown. Community Finstown has a post office, Firth Primary School, a pub called the Pomona Inn (closed at present), a shop and a garage. Most of these buildings are situated on the main Stromness to Kirkwall road.

The school has taken part in this competition since the 2007‚Äì2008 season, with numerous successes. The team Redshift succeeded the London & South-East England Regional Final and then came 3rd in the national final at the ExCel Arena, London. They then later became a collaboration team, meaning that they joined another team ‚Äì which was a team from Singapore. The team renamed from Redshift to X-Shift, since the Singapore team were called something that was inaudible but began with an X. This meant that they took part in the World Finals held in Texas. Another team called Turbocharged has taken part in the Bloodhound SSC class, which is the same as the F1 class but it is designing a car based around the Bloodhound SSC. The team succeeded the regional final in the 2012‚Äì13 season, and then won the national final, meaning that they were national champions and gained a new world-record time for their car racing down the track (this record was 0.587 seconds). In the 2013‚Äì14 season, the team entered again into the competition and were unsuccessful, but after lodging a complaint about other teams being illegal, meant they were able to move to the national finals as a wildcard. The team then proudly attended the national final and won the it again, meaning that they are the only team that has ever become national champions twice. For the 2015 Bloodhound SSC Class, a new team was formed called Vortex. The team consisted of three old members of Turbocharged, and a new member. Vortex did not succeed in the regionals, but were selected as a wildcard to progress to the nationals. They had the fastest time, but this was considerably slower than previous years, as the rules had changed, forcing the 8-gram car up to 30 grams. The team used the same principle of golf balls to create a turbulent boundary layer, to increase the speed of the car. The team won the national finals.

Early life, education and career Addison Brown was born on February 21, 1830, in West Newbury, Massachusetts, the oldest of five children of Addison Brown Sr., a shoemaker, and Catherine Babson Griffin, both descended from Massachusetts' earliest Pilgrim settlers. He attended West Newbury's one-room school until he had exhausted its offerings at age 12. In 1843 he began more advanced studies in such areas as Latin, physics, algebra, and philosophy. In 1848 Brown entered Amherst College, intending from the start to transfer to Harvard University in his sophomore year. While at Harvard, Brown earned money as the college organist and unhappily spent some summer months as a village school teacher. Brown befriended and roomed with his Harvard classmate Horatio Alger and counted Ephraim Whitman Gurney (who became a professor of philosophy and history and dean of the Harvard faculty) as his closest college friend. Brown received an Artium Baccalaureus degree in 1852 from Harvard University, ranked second in his class. Joseph Hodges Choate, who became a lawyer and diplomat, was ranked third. Joseph's brother, William Gardner Choate, who preceded Brown in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, was valedictorian; George Bethune Adams, Brown's successor on the bench, was also a member of the class of 1852. To restore his health after years dedicated to study, Brown spent the summer of 1852 working aboard a fishing boat, sailing out of Gloucester, Massachusetts to Prince Edward Island. In his Autobiographical Notes, Brown wrote that a college graduate in his circumstances had three career choices: the ministry, medicine or the law. He \\"knew nothing of the law, or of lawyers personally, ... and disliked the life of a physician.\\" After consideration, he deemed himself ill-suited for the ministry: \\"Only law remained.\\" Upon learning that he could save almost half of the cost of a Harvard law degree by working and studying in a law office for a year, Brown returned home to the law offices of John James Marsh. Brown entered Harvard Law School in 1853, receiving a Bachelor of Laws in late 1854.Addison Brown by Whipple, 1852. Law practice Armed with introductions from a Harvard professor, in December 1854 Brown arrived in New York City, New York (whose burgeoning business community Brown found more promising than opportunities in his native small-town northeast Massachusetts) and began work as a clerk for the firm of Brown (unrelated), Hall (then-New York's mayor), and Vanderpoel. There he met other lawyers, learned about the practice of law, and studied for the New York bar examination, which he passed in February 1855. In that year he began developing a small portfolio of clients of his own and supplemented his income with work as organist and choir director in the Episcopal Church in Newton, Long Island. Brown struck out on his own and then joined Nelson Smith in 1856. In 1857 he partnered with Edwin E. Bogardus, who had an established and varied law practice, to form the firm of Bogardus and Brown. That firm prospered until its dissolution in May 1864, when Brown formed Stanley, Langdell & Brown with longtime friends. He remained in that partnership (later named Stanley, Brown & Clarke when Langdell left to become dean of Harvard Law School) until his judicial appointment in 1881. Investment ventures Brown stated that when deciding on a path after college, he found a business career not to his taste, inasmuch as he had no interest in \\"mere wealth\\" or a \\"life of money-making.\\" He did, however, participate in business ventures and accrue considerable wealth. In the late 1850s he began investing in and doing legal work for real estate transactions in which large areas of land at the edges of development in New York City were subdivided and sold at considerable profit. His success was such that prosperous individuals in Brown's hometown of West Newbury and surrounding areas entrusted him to invest their funds, providing the investors a 7% return and Brown any amounts over that. This allowed him to engage in more real estate ventures. Brown stated, \\"The handling of considerable funds in that way for many years not only brought me considerable gains beyond my law business proper, but also gave me much credit as a responsible person, and attracted clients in the building business, and it thus much enlarged my own contributions to our strictly law practice.\\" Federal judicial service Brown received a recess appointment from President James A. Garfield on June 2, 1881, to a seat on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. On October 12, 1881, President Chester A. Arthur nominated him to the same position. Brown's United States Senate confirmation took place on October 14, 1881; he received his commission the same day. Brown had become a member of his local Republican club in the late 1850s and remained active in Republican politics while neither seeking nor obtaining a political position prior to his judgeship. Brown's 20-year judgeship was described as prolific and distinguished. He was credited as having written between 1,600 to over 2,000 decisions, many of them concerning admiralty, bankruptcy, and extradition. His most famous case involved the libel charges against journalist Charles Anderson Dana brought by the administration of Ulysses S. Grant. Brown refused to extradite Dana from New York to Washington, D.C., holding that before extradition may occur, an offense must be shown and regular procedures followed. Due to physical disabilities, Brown resigned from the court in 1901. The New York Times stated upon his retirement that Brown was \\"regarded as one of the most hard-working and painstaking Judges on the bench.\\" In the year following his retirement, Harvard honored him with an LL.D. Botany and astronomy Newspaper accounts called Brown not only a great jurist, but also a great scientist, learned as a botanist and to a lesser degree as an astronomer. Obituaries noted his versatility and compared him to polymath poet and doctor Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. Modern sources have also recognized his wide range of pursuits and accomplishments.Addisonia (PLATE 009) (8575333844) from the botany journal Addison Brown endowed In 1875, Brown joined the Torrey Botanical Club of Columbia College in New York and was an active member for many years, serving as president from 1893 to 1905. As the club's president, Brown served on the Botanical Garden Committee and became a principal founder of the New York Botanical Garden. Brown cited his role in the Botanical Garden's founding as his most significant public service, aside from his work in the judiciary. He wrote that organization's charter in 1891 and in that year donated the initial $25,000 (which he viewed as \\"quite out of proportion to my means at that time\\") toward the $250,000 in private seed money required pursuant to the New York legislature's authorization for municipal contributions. Brown traveled to collect botanical specimens, maintained an extensive botanical library, wrote many notes for Torrey Botanical Club publications and published the following works: * Illustrated Flora of the Northern United States and Canada (three volumes, 1896‚Äì98; new edition, 1913 -- with Nathaniel L. Britton) * The Elgin Botanical Garden and its Relation to Columbia College and the New Hampshire Grants (1908) At age 81, Brown began work on a revised and expanded edition of Illustrated Flora, which contained over 2,000 pages and some 5,000 illustrations. With his co-author Britton, he worked on this for the rest of his life, even as his health failed. Brown died four days after the first bound copies were shipped. At his death, Brown's single largest charitable bequest‚Äî200 shares of United States Steel preferred stock worth $21,750 in 1913‚Äîwas to the New York Botanical Garden to endow a botanical journal. The periodical was to be named for Brown and to contain color plates illustrating plants of the United States and its territories. This publication, named Addisonia, was issued between 1916 and 1964. Brown was also a serious amateur astronomer. He was a founding member of the New York Academy of Science's astronomy section. Brown's Colorado mountaintop observations of the July 29, 1878 solar eclipse were included in a report of the United States Naval Observatory. Personal life and death Brown met his first wife, Mary Chadwick Barrett, in 1846 at Bradford Academy, near West Newbury, as he studied to prepare for college. Together they studied astronomy, in which she excelled. Informally engaged since his days at Amherst, they married on January 1, 1856, when financially able to maintain a household. She was an invalid before their marriage. Notwithstanding various cures meeting with mixed success, her physical and mental condition worsened until her death in 1887. In July of 1893, Brown married Helen Carpenter Gaskin, a botany teacher at the New York Normal College, which later became Hunter College. He was in his 60s; she was considerably younger. One newspaper report stated that the bride was said to be attractive and charming: \\"Not a little romance is connected with their courtship.\\" Others described surprise that Brown, active in numerous elite New York social clubs, managed to keep the impending wedding secret. The couple pursued joint scientific interests, and had three sons and a daughter.The sarcophagus of Addison Brown in Woodlawn Cemetery Stricken with paralysis, Addison Brown died at his Manhattan home on April 9, 1913 at age 83. He was interred in a sarcophagus at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx. Brown's estate was estimated at $750,000. While the bulk of his bequests were in trust for his children, Brown left $40,000 to charities, principally the bequest to the New York Botanical Garden magazine, and scholarship prizes for Harvard University and Amherst College. Smaller gifts went to organizations ranging from the Tuskegee Institute to the West Newbury Library Association.

She also is a keen supporter of Brain Tumour Research, Cardboard Citizens and various cancer charities. Beeny, who started Property Development and Investment businesses at the age of 19 with her brother, and then-boyfriend and now-husband, was also founder of the online businesses www.mysinglefriend.com and Tepilo.com. Beeny has written regular columns for national newspapers and magazines, in addition to numerous books. Beeny launched her podcast Round the Houses with Sarah Beeny in 2018, featuring a host of rich and famous guests who allow Sarah into their homes and their lives. Series one includes Joe Sugg, Julian Clary, June Sarpong, Jo Wood, Lynn Bowles, Pearl Lowe and Tim Lovejoy. Biography Beeny was born in Reading, Berkshire, to Richard and Ann. Beeny has an elder brother, Diccon. The daughter of an architect for Bovis Homes, her mother loved the self-sustained outdoor life. The family lived in two converted brick cottages in a nine-acre plot on the edge of the Duke of Wellington's estate Stratfield Saye, in a style that Beeny describes as \\"a bit like The Good Life.\\" The family kept goats, chickens and ducks, while her father made dolls-house furniture to raise extra cash. Beeny has described her family in this period as \\"...crafty-entrepreneurial but more craft than entrepreneurial.\\" After her mother died aged 39 of breast cancer when Beeny was 10, she was educated as a weekly boarder at the all-girls Luckley-Oakfield School in Wokingham. Although her friends went to university, Beeny did not; she was encouraged to study drama by her English teacher and took a leading role in Brecht's Caucasian Chalk Circle. Pursuing the idea of becoming a professional actress, she studied drama at Queen Mary's College, Basingstoke, but failed to get into a drama school. Beeny traveled around the world solo at the age of 17 and felt \\"lonely and seasick\\" most of the way round. She returned to the UK to take a series of jobs, including: working for Save the Children; window-cleaning; door-to-door vacuum cleaner-selling and running her own sandwich-making business. Assuming she would be self-employed for the rest of her life, at weekends she would study the property market, which gave her a good grounding in the market. Having saved up a deposit, without any formal training, Beeny began her own property-developing business with her brother and her husband. Beeny is also the co-founder of the UK dating website Mysinglefriend. Beeny met her husband and business partner, Graham Swift, when she was 18 years old. Her brother is married to Swift's sister, Caroline. Beeny and Swift have four sons. They previously lived in Streatham. They also owned Rise Hall, in the East Riding of Yorkshire; Beeny and Swift sold Rise Hall for ¬£1.4 million in 2019. After selling Rise Hall, Beeny and Swift quit London and moved to the Somerset countryside. Property media After meeting at a hen party the sister-in-law of Sarah Delafield-Cook, a talent hunter at Talkback Thames, Beeny was asked to undertake a screen test to front a new programme series about property development, which was to be fronted by a property expert. Taking the advice of her stepmother, the successful format Property Ladder has led to various spin-off series, including Streets Ahead, Britain's Best Homes and Property Snakes and Ladders. In 2006, Sarah presented another Channel 4 programme, One Year to Pay Off Your Mortgage. She has written a number of books to accompany the series, as well as a weekly column for the Mail on Sunday. In August 2007, Sarah starred in a promotional trailer for Channel 4 which was made in the form of a parody of a Kung Fu movie. The classic line \\"You dare to challenge the might of the Beeny\\", was said by Beeny to the evil nemesis. Later that year, she also appeared on the Channel 5 motoring show Fifth Gear, where she raced Jason Plato in an articulated lorry around a course. Beeny has appeared on Gordon Ramsay's The F-Word, where she offered up her garden for Gordon's sheep to feed on. She regularly appears on television and is a friend of DJ Christian O' Connell. She has also appeared on Bob the Builder alongside Dermot O'Leary, on which she estimated the value of Bob the Builder's house to be \\"Two Bob\\". Since August 2010, she has fronted the Channel 4 programme Help! My House is Falling Down, which had the working title of House Rescue before its commission. In November 2010, she presented Beeny's Restoration Nightmare on Channel 4, showing her renovation of Rise Hall, a Grade II* listed historic house near Rise, East Riding of Yorkshire, to create a wedding venue. In August 2011, Beeny began presenting a new series for BBC One titled Village SOS. In this series, the programme follows a group of passionate villagers who want to restore their village to its former glory. In 2012, Sarah presented Double your House for Half the Money, a series that showed viewers how they can have the home they've always dreamed about, even if you can't afford to buy it.

Its office is located at 575 Madison Avenue, New York City following the sale of the 684 Park Avenue location in 2016.  History  On May 18, 1954, The Institute was incorporated as a non-political, non-profit organization under the laws of the State of New York. Its mission is to stimulate interest in the culture, history and customs of Spain and other Spanish-speaking countries in the United States, and vice versa. In 1965, The Marquesa de Cuevas, the philanthropist Margaret Rockefeller Strong, saved the landmark building 684 Park Avenue from destruction. The asking price for this building was $48 million but with the economic support of Margaret Rockefeller Strong and that of the McMicking Foundation, the Institute was able to make this building its headquarters. On October 26, 1978, The Institute's Gold Medal Dinner was established in order to recognize individuals who have contributed to the international appreciation of Spain and Ibero-America through their achievements in such varied disciplines as international relations, science, business, the arts, literature, and philanthropy. The first honorees of 1978 were Henry Ford II and Andr√©s Segovia (in absentia). The Institute was renamed in 2003, to recognize Queen Sof√≠a of Spain as its patroness. In 2014, the Institute strategically decided to sell its building in order to carry on with its mission. Since the sale of the building, the Queen Sofia Spanish Institute has revitalized its activities with other Spanish and Latin American schools/organizations by cosponsoring lectures, educational programs and other culturally relevant activities. In 2018, the Institute formed a partnership with the Hispanic Society to provide a Maps and Globes educational program in New York City Public Schools of District 6. Other partners of the Institute include the Instituto Cervantes, Hunter College, Juilliard, The Spanish Consulate and the Americas Society. The Institute holds an annual ceremony to present the \\"Sophia Award for Excellence\\". This award pays tribute to a person or an organization that has actively contributed to the international appreciation of Spain and the Americas through a donation of time, expertise and innate wisdom in the areas of science, arts or the humanities. The president and CEO is David Askren and the executive director since September, 2017 is Patrice Degnan Erquicia. Background Queen Sof√≠a Spanish Institute, Inc. (The ‚ÄúInstitute‚Äù) is a not-for-profit corporation founded in 1954 to stimulate American's interest in the Art, Culture, Customs, language, literature and history of the Spanish speaking world and to promote, among the Spanish-speaking peoples of the world, knowledge and understanding of ideals, culture and customs of the people of the United States, to the end that ties of friendship may be formed, mutual understanding promoted, and bonds of peace strengthened. Cultural events The Institute holds a wide variety of artistic endeavors, including the co-sponsoring of exhibitions and lectures on important artistic movements, artists and their works. Along with visual arts, the institute strives to support performance art as well, including concerts, performances, and lectures on the relevance of this art in today's society. The Institute also holds gastronomy events in order to enrich American's knowledge of foods of the Spanish-speaking world and to bring people together. The Institute holds a biannual translation prize to recognize translators who have successfully translated a work from Spanish to English and helped to make knowledge accessible. The Institute holds historical and educational lectures in order to enrich American's understanding and knowledge of the Spanish- Speaking World. Gala Gold Medalists Beginning in 1978, The Queen Sof√≠a Spanish Institute's Gold Medal was annually awarded to Americans and Hispanic people in recognition of their contributions to the betterment of relations between the United States and the Spanish Speaking World. This event brings together an array of international and American leaders and benefactors for a festive night of celebration. The Gala is a major source of funds for the activities of the institute. Early recipients of the Gold Medal were Henry Ford, James Michener, Montserrat Caballe, Placido Domingo, Pablo Casals, and Jose Carreras. Former long-time Spanish Institute President and Chairman, Eric M. Javits (US Arms Control Ambassador 2001-2009), received the Gold Medal in 1994. Last year's 2010 Gala Gold medalists included Diane von F√ºrstenberg and the Spanish National Soccer Team. Other recent medalists include the Duchess of Alba in 2008, Pen√©lope Cruz and President Bill Clinton in 2007, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in 2006, and Dr. Henry Kissinger in 2005. In 2003, a 15th Anniversary Commemorative Medal was awarded to His Majesty King Juan Carlos I and Her Majesty Queen Sofia of Spain. Other well-known past medalists include fashion designer Carolina Herrera in 1997 and the institute's past chairman and fashion designer Oscar de la Renta in 1993. The winners of the 2013 Queen Sofia Spanish Institute Gold Medal Awards celebrated at the Waldorf Astoria, in New York City on November 19, 2013, was Antonio Banderas and Hillary Rodham Clinton. The Institute no longer holds a Gold Medal Gala. Translation Prize With the aim of elevating awareness and engendering an appreciation of Spanish literature in the United States, this triennial $10,000 prize has been created by the Cultural Committee and board of directors of Queen Sof√≠a Spanish Institute to honor the best English-language translation of a work by a Spanish author. The inaugural award, celebrating the best translation published between 2006 and 2008, was given in 2010 to Edith Grossman for her 2008 translation of Antonio Mu√±oz Molina's A Manuscript of Ashes. This prize celebrates the work and dedication of the translator and the $10,000. The first initiative in place after the institute's recent changes include the selection of a brilliant reading committee composed of published writers, scholars, translators and academics to select the best translation of a work of fiction written in Spanish, between 2010 and 2017. The panel is now reviewing nominations and nominees will be selected in the first quarter of 2018, and then the committee will read the works in Spanish and English and the winner will be selected in late summer and the award will be presented in the fall of 2018. The Queen Sofia Spanish Institute is honored to have such strong intellectuals leading this important cultural committee. The committee members include: Lila Zemborain is the chair of this Reading Committee and director of the Creative Writing in Spanish Program at NYU. Allen Young is 2018 winner of the translation prize and a translator. Leslie Harkema is a professor at Yale and teaches courses on Spanish culture and Modern Peninsular Literature.

The first cab-over engine (COE) truck produced with a tilting cab by Ford, the C-series replaced the C-series COE variant of the F-series, produced since 1948. Produced as both a straight/rigid truck and a tractor, a wide range of versions of C-series was produced, ranging from Class 5 to Class 8 GVWR ratings. The C-series was also used as a basis for fire apparatus production. Produced for 33 years nearly unchanged (with the exception of its powertrain), the C-series was the longest-produced commercial truck in North America at the time of its withdrawal; only the Mack Model R (39 years) and Kenworth W900 (59 years) have remained in production longer. In 1986, Ford began phasing in the Ford Cargo in North America, serving as its replacement after the 1990 model year. C series COE (1948-1956) \\"Helmet-shaped\\" COE (1955 Ford C-600) Like other automotive manufacturers that built COE trucks before the 1960s, early Ford C-series trucks were \\"helmet-shaped\\", cab-forward trucks that shared components with pickup trucks (the F series, in this case). From 1948-52, they were simply COE versions of the F-5, F-6, F-7, and F-8. For 1953, they were redesignated the C series, but largely remained modified F-series trucks. Models consisted of the C-500, C-600, C-700, C-750, C-800, C-850 and C-900. Like the F-900, the C-900 also included a \\"Big Job\\" model. Diesel-engined trucks included an extra zero in the model designations (i.e. C-8000 or C-9000). Design history alt=Decommissioned 1973 Ford C-900 fire truck, for sale at a restaurant in 1973 Ford C-900 fire truck Ford C-series fire truck in action in 2010 As Ford started squaring off its vehicles in 1957, they finally gave the cab-overs their own designs separate from the rest of the Ford truck lineup. It featured a small grille near the front bumper, with a four-pointed star emblem on each end, the word \\"FORD\\" spelled out below the windshield, and had a cog-and-lightning bolt crest emblem between the headlights. Variations of this emblem were found on many other Ford trucks during the 1950s and into the 1960s. The C series held onto this logo the longest. Design updates In a fashion similar to the Checker Marathon or Volkswagen Beetle, changes to the C-series trucks throughout its production were very subtle. If anywhere, many of these changes were identifiable by the changes in the cowl insignias and badging. Between 1958 and 1960, the C series used a quad-headlight fascia. This was helpful for fire departments, which wanted to use the extra headlight bezels for emergency flashers, an option that was offered exclusively to fire, and other emergency vehicles after 1960. In 1961, Ford reverted to the single headlight design; the regular C-series cab closely resembled the 1957 version. A new Super Duty model was added. Another option included a small sleeper cab. =1963-1990= For 1963, the C series was updated with the same cowl insignias used by the rest of the medium- and heavy-duty truck line up. The logo had the word FORD on top of a trapezoid with the model number designation. This insignia was used until 1967.[American Truck & Bus Spotter's Guide: 1920-1985, by Tad Burness.][Ford Trucks Since 1905, by James K. Wagner.] Also in 1963, Ford introduced diesel versions of the C series, as well as the N series and heavy-duty F series. 1986 Ford C-800 Diesel In 1968, federal regulations required all automotive manufacturers to add side marker reflectors or lights, which Ford was able to add to the new cowl insignia used on the F series since 1967. That same year, Ford decided to add this insignia on the doors of the C series, as well. Unlike the Ford F series, which removed them for 1973, the C series would retain them until the end of production in 1990. After 1972, the Canadian Mercury version of the C series was discontinued, becoming the last Mercury truck until the 1993 Mercury Villager. The year 1974 was the last for the cog- and-lightning bolt crest that graced the front of the C series trucks from the beginning, and other Ford trucks since the 1950s. In the 1980s, Ford began adding its blue oval logo to all models; it was added to the C series in 1984. In 1981, the Ford Cargo was introduced by Ford of Britain as its largest truck line. For 1986, Ford began sales of the Cargo in North America, sourcing production from Ford Brasil. While the Cargo was largely intended to replace the C-Series, the popularity of the C-Series in niche applications led to both model lines marketed concurrently through the end of the 1980s. After 33 model years with only minor changes, the final C-Series trucks were built in 1990. In 1997, importation of the Cargo came to an end, as Ford sold the rights to the model line (alongside that of the Ford Louisville/Aeromax) to Freightliner.

Named the H series, this version placed the cab much higher on the chassis; instead of being placed underneath the drivers' seat, the front axle was moved forward, directly underneath the driver. With the higher placement of the cab, space was available for a larger grille, shared with the N-series conventional trucks. The cab cutouts for the C-series front wheels were turned into underfloor toolboxes and luggage space. With the stacked appearance of the H series, it soon earned the nickname \\"Two Story Falcon\\".Ford H Model (2 Story Falcon) Cab Over (Sour Kraut's Model Truck Parts)Keith Cantone Collection (Hank's Truck Pictures) HD-series trucks, with Cummins N-series diesels, were the first Ford diesel trucks. The \\"Two Story Falcon\\" lasted until 1966, when it was replaced by the W-series COE trucks. Usage by other manufacturers Some historians have erroneously referred to the Ford tilt-cab as the \\"Budd\\" cab, implying it was an off-the-shelf item available to anyone. However, the C-series cab was designed by Ford, tooled at its own expense and built by the Budd Company to Ford Motor Company specifications. Other truck manufacturers had to obtain Ford approval before purchasing it. The exception was Mack, which bought most of the major cab stampings from Budd and assembled them itself on a floor pan of its own design. In Canada, the Ford \\"C\\" had an identical twin - the Mercury \\"M\\" Series offered from 1957 to 1972. At least four truck makers used the Ford C-series tilt cab. Best known was the look- alike Mack model \\"N\\", which was produced between 1958 and 1962. The Four- Wheel-Drive Auto Company used some Ford \\"C\\" cabs which bore the FWD emblems, and Yankee-Walter used C-series cab components on some of its large airport crash trucks. In Canada, the Thibault fire truck manufacturer of Pierreville, Quebec, also used C-series parts for their Custom (i.e. non-commercial chassis) trucks.

The founder of the Macdonalds of Sleat was √ôisdean, or Hugh, a 6th great-grandson of Somerled, a 12th-century Lord of the Isles (R√¨ Innse Gall). The clan is known in Gaelic as Clann √ôisdein (\\"children of √ôisdein\\"), and its chief's Gaelic designation is Mac √ôisdein (\\"son of √ôisdean\\"), in reference to the clan's founder. Both the clan and its clan chief are recognised by the Lord Lyon King of Arms, who is the heraldic authority in Scotland. The Macdonalds of Sleat participated in several feuds with neighbouring clans, most notably the Macleods of Harris & Dunvegan and the Macleans of Duart. The clan also suffered from infighting in the early 16th century, as the leading members of the clan fought and murdered each other. The clan seems to have grudgingly supported the Royalist cause in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, and suffered grievously in military defeats against Parliamentarian forces. The clan supported the Jacobite cause in the 1715 rebellion, yet refused to come out for Bonnie Prince Charlie and his father a generation later in 1745. In the early 18th century, the clan's chief was involved in a plan to sell tenants into slavery in the American Colonies. By the late 18th century, the chiefs had alienated themselves from the common clansfolk, when they seated themselves in northern England and rarely visited the old clan lands. The 18th and 19th centuries witnessed the suffering of the common clansfolk, as many were cleared off their lands at the hands of their absentee landlords. Today members and descendants of the clan live all over the world. Sources Much of the history of the Macdonalds of Sleat comes from traditional family histories, and it is often difficult, if not impossible, to tell fact from fiction.Macdonald; Macdonald 1900, 1: p. 1. The clan histories relevant to the Macdonalds of Sleat were composed by the shenachies (historians or story tellers) MacVuirich ‚Äì the Clanranald shenachie; and Hugh Macdonald ‚Äì the Sleat shenachie. Contemporary records that shed light upon the early history of the clan include charters and confirmations of charters granted by kings, and various bonds of manrent entered with other landlords and clan chiefs. History of the Macdonalds of Sleat R.R. McIan's Victorian era romanticised depiction of a Macdonald, lord of the Isles. Origins The Macdonalds of Sleat are a branch of Clan Donald ‚Äî one of the largest Scottish clans.Newton 2007: p. 37. The eponymous ancestor of Clan Donald is Domhnall, son of Raghnall, son of Somhairle. Traditional Clan Donald genealogies, created in the later Middle Ages, give the clan a descent from various legendary Irish figures. Modern historians, however, distrust these traditional genealogies, and consider Somhairle, son of Gille Brighde to be earliest ancestor for whom there is secure historical evidence.Woolf 2007: p. 299. Somhairle, himself, was a 12th-century leader, styled \\"king of the isles\\" and \\"king of Argyll\\";Brown 2004: p. 70. yet there is no reliable account for his rise to power. The Macdonalds of Sleat descend from Domhnall's son, Aonghas M√≥r; and then from his son, Aonghas √ìg. Angus √ìg's son, Eoin, was the first Lord of the Isles. Eoin I's first marriage was to √Åine, heiress of Clann Ruaidhr√≠ (which was founded by Ruaidhr√≠, elder brother to Domhnall, founder of Clan Donald).Duffy 2007: pp. 77‚Äì85. Eoin I later divorced √Åine and married Margaret, daughter of Robert II. The children from Eoin I's first marriage were then passed over in the main succession of the chiefship of Clan Donald and later Macdonald lords of the isles, in favour of those from his second marriage.Eyre-Todd 1923, 2: pp. 269‚Äì270. Eoin I was succeeded by his son, Domhnall of Islay; who was in turn succeeded by his son, Alasdair of Islay. The Macdonalds of Sleat descend from √ôisdean, bastard son of Alasdair of Islay and the daughter of √ì Be√≥ll√°in (O'Beolan), Abbot of Applecross. From √ôisdean, the Macdonalds of Sleat are also known in Gaelic as Clann √ôisdein (\\"the children of √ôisdein\\").Macdonald; Macdonald 1900, 3: pp. 467‚Äì479. 15th century Ruinous Dunscaith Castle, Skye. The castle was once a MacLeod stronghold. It became the earliest seat of Clann √ôisdein in the lands of Sleat. The first record of √ôisdean occur in the traditional histories of the shenachie MacVurich and Hugh Macdonald. According to the Sleat shenachie, √ôisdean, along with several young gentlemen from the Western Isles went on a raiding expedition to Orkney. The tradition runs that the Western Islesmen were victorious in their conflict with the Northern Islesmen, and that the Earl of Orkney was also slain. √ôisdean is then said to have ravaged Orkney, and carried off much loot. According to Angus and Archibald Macdonald, √ôisdean's expedition took place around 1460, when he did not appear to hold title to any of the lands his family who come to hold. In fact, in the year 1463, Eoin II, Lord of the Isles granted √ôisdean's older brother, Celestine, the 28 merklands of Sleat, in addition to extensive lands in west Ross given to him in the previous year. In 1469, √ôisdean received from the Earl of Ross the 30 merklands of Skeirhough in South Uist; the 12 merklands of Benbecula, and the merkland of Gergryminis also in Benbecula; the 2 merklands of Scolpig, the 4 merklands of Tallowmartin, the 6 merklands of Orinsay, the half merkland of Wanlis, all in North Uist; and also the 28 merklands of Sleat. The earliest Clann √ôisdein seat connected with the barony of Sleat was Dunscaith Castle, off the Sound of Sleat. √ôisdean played not a small part in securing the surrender of the Earl of Ross, for which he was promised by the king 20 pounds worth of land, in 1476. The lordship of the isles was forfeited in 1493, and √ôisdean obtained a royal confirmation for his lands granted to him by the Earl of Ross in 1469. √ôisdean died in 1498, and was buried at Sand, in North Uist. During his life, √ôisdean had several wives and several known children by other women. Some of √ôisdean's sons would go on to play a large part in the history of the clan in the early 16th century. His eldest son, Eoin, would go on to succeed him.Macdonald; Macdonald 1900, 3: pp. 1‚Äì6. Other notable sons included: D√≤mhnall Gallach, son of the daughter of a prominent member of Clan Gunn (Caithness is called Gallaibh in Gaelic). Another son was D√≤mhnall Hearach, so-called from the fact his mother was a daughter of Macleod of Harris, and where he probably spent a portion of his early life; Aonghas Collach, so-called from the fact his mother was a daughter of Maclean of Coll; Gilleasbaig Dubh was the son of a daughter of Torquil Macleod of the Lewes; and Aonghas Dubh was the son of a daughter Maurice Vicar of South Uist.Macdonald; Macdonald 1900, 3: pp. 9‚Äì15. Early 16th century Duntulm Castle in Trotternish, Skye. Trotternish was the subject of territorial feuding between the Macdonalds of Sleat and MacLeods of Dunvegan in the 16th and early 17th centuries.Roberts 2000: pp. 4‚Äì5. On the year of his succession, Eoin resigned the lands and superiorities to the king. In consequence, the lands of Kendess, Gergryminis, 21 merklands of Eigg, and 24 merklands of Arisaig were then granted to Ranald Bane Allanson of Clanranald (chief of the Macdonalds of Clanranald). In 1498, the king granted to Alasdair Crotach (chief of Clan MacLeod) two unicates of the barony of Trotternish with the office of the bailiary of the whole lands thereof. Also the same year, the king granted Torquil MacLeod of Lewis (chief of Clan MacLeod of Lewis) the same bailiary of Trotternish which was granted to the chief of the Clan MacLeod, and also the 4 merklands of Terunga of Duntulm and 4 merklands of Airdmhiceolan. A and A Macdonald noted that during the minority of the Stewart kings in the 15 and 16th centuries many charters for the same lands were granted to several individuals. It is no wonder that in 1498 James IV revoked all charters given during the period prior to his coming of age. In 1505, Eoin resigned the lands of Sleat and North Uist, including Dunscaith Castle, to Ranald Allanson of Island Begrim. On his death, the chiefship of the clan passed to D√≤mhnall Gallach, second son of √ôisdean.Macdonald; Macdonald 1900, 3: pp. 6‚Äì9. Because of the way in which his predecessor had granted away the clan lands, there is no contemporary record of D√≤mhnall Gallach. The only record of D√≤mhnall Gallach is from tradition. According to the Sleat shenachie, he was present at the Battle of Bloody Bay in 1484, and there fought on the side of Aonghas √ìg against his father, Eoin, Lord of the Isles. Even though D√≤mhnall Gallach's legal right to much his father's lands was given away by his predecessor, he and his brothers managed to physically hold on to their lands in Skye and Uist. Notwithstanding Clanranald's charter, D√≤mhnall Gallach had his seat at Dunscaith Castle. D√≤mhnall Gallach did not reign long as chief as he was murdered in 1506, by his brother, Gilleasbaig Dubh. The brothers Gilleasbaig Dubh, Aonghas Dubh and Aonghas Collach also conspired together and murdered their other half-brother, D√≤mhnall Hearach, on the Inch of Loch Scolpig. Not long after the murders, Ranald Bane of Moydart forced Gilleasbaig Dubh to flee Uist, whereupon he participated in piratical career in the southern Hebrides for about 3 years. Gilleasbaig Dubh earned the favour of the Government by handing over similar pirates John Mor and Alister Bernich, of Clan Allister of Kintyre. After doing so he returned to the lands of Clann √ôisdein, assumed the leadership of the clan and took possession of the bailiary of Trotternish, all with the consent of the Government. =Clann √ôisdein chaos= During the time of Gilleasbaig Dubh's piratical career, the traditional history of Clann √ôisdein is a tale of violence and lawlessness. According to the Sleat shenachie, Aonghas Collach travelled to North Uist with a number of his followers and spent the night the home of D√≤mhnall of Balranald (who was a member of the Siol Gorrie: descendants of Gorraidh (Godfrey), youngest son of Eoin and Ami MacRauiri).Macdonald; Macdonald 1900, 3: pp. 359‚Äì360. Balranald happened to be away from home at the time, and that night Aonghas Collach attempted to rape his wife (who was a Macdonald of Clanranald). After her escape to South Uist, she alerted her friends and family. The result was that a body of 60 men, led by Donald MacRanald, and large contingent of S√¨ol Ghorraidh men marched north and surprised Aonghas Collach at Kirkibost. There 18 of Aonghas Collach's men were slain and he himself was taken prisoner. He was then sent to Macdonald of Clanranald, in South Uist, and tied up into a sack and cast into the sea. Another of √ôisdean's sons, Aonghas Dubh was also made prisoner by Macdonald of Clanranald, and was long held captive. One day he was permitted to run on the Strand of Askernish in South Uist, to see if he could run as well as he could prior to his incarceration. Aonghas Dubh then attempted flee his guards, however he was then wounded in the leg by an arrow. The wound was considered incurable and Aonghas Dubh was summarily put to death. Soon after his return, Gilleasbaig Dubh's took revenge on S√¨ol Ghorraidh for their treatment of Aonghas Collach, and put many of them to death. The manner of Gilleasbaig Dubh's death is also recorded by the Sleat shenachie. This account tells how D√≤mhnall Gruamach, son of D√≤mhnall Gallach, and his half-brother Raghnall, son of D√≤mhnall Hearach, went to North Uist to visit Gilleasbaig Dubh who had murdered their father. One day, the two half-brothers, Gilleasbaig Dubh, and their henchmen, went hunting south of Lochmaddy. While the attendants were beating up the hill the three men sat waited for the game to appear. In time, Gilleasbaig Dubh eventually fell asleep and Raghnall killed his uncle. A and A Macdonald gave the date of Gilleasbaig Dubh's murder at probably about 1515‚Äì1520.Macdonald; Macdonald 1900, 3: pp. 15‚Äì16. Mid to late 16th century A 16th-century engraving of a Highland galley or birlinn. The Hebridean clans utilised such vessels in their constant warring with other. D√≤mhnall Gallach succeeded to the chiefship after the death of Gilleasbaig Dubh. In 1521, the chief rendered a bond of manrent to Sir John Campbell of Cawdor. A and A Macdonald stated that this bond may have led the Sleat chief to follow Cawdor, in 1523, on the Duke of Albany's campaign against England. The campaign did not go well for the two chiefs, as both Sleat and Cawdor's names are recorded on a remission for leaving the field of battle during the siege of Wark Castle. A and A Macdonald also stated that it was likely on their return from the borders that Cawdor and his followers (including Sleat) murdered Lachlann Cattanach Maclean of Duart, in Edinburgh. In 1524, D√≤mhnall Gruamach entered into an alliance with the chief of Clan Mackintosh; and later in 1527, he entered into bonds with Mackintosh, Munro, Rose of Kilravock and Campbell of Cawdor. In 1528, D√≤mhnall Gruamach received considerable support from his half-brother, Iain, son of Torquil, chief of Clan Macleod of Lewis. That year their combined forces were successful in driving out the Macleods of Harris & Dunvegan, and their vassals, from the barony of Trotternish. D√≤mhnall Gruamach, in return, then aided Macleod of Lewis in obtaining effective possession of Lewis. Macleod of Harris & Dunvegan then appealed to the Privy Council, and that year a summons was issued to the chiefs of Sleat and Lewis. As conflicts in the Hebrides increased over time, the Privy Council ordered the chieftains of the isles to appear before the king in 1530. The following year Sleat, Macleod of Harris & Dunvegan, and Mackinnon of Strathardill were frequently cited before Parliament but failed to appear. After 1530, D√≤mhnall Gallach's chiefship seems to have been uneventful and peaceful, as there is no record of his name in state records until his death, in about 1537.Macdonald; Macdonald 1900, 3: pp. 16‚Äì19. The chiefship of the clan then passed to D√≤mhnall Gallach's son, D√≤mhnall Gorm. D√≤mhnall Gorm was killed at Eilean Donan in 1539 and was succeeded by his eldest son, D√≤mhnall Gormeson. As D√≤mhnall Gormeson was only a child at the time of his father's death, the leadership of the clan went to his granduncle, Gilleasbaig Cl√®ireach, son of D√≤mhnall Gallach. According to the Sleat shenachie, the Privy Council made a strong attempt to apprehend the young chief during his minority. The traditional history has it that he was sent to the safety of Ruairidh Macleod of Lewis. Though afterwards, Gilleasbaig Cleireach took D√≤mhnall Gormeson to England, where the young chief lived for several years. In 1554, with anarchy prevailing in the Highlands, the Queen Dowager took control of the Government and attempted to restore peace and order. Her lieutenants, Argyll and Huntly, were ordained by the Privy Council to passify the most unruly chiefs, among these was D√≤mhnall Gormeson. Shortly afterwards, D√≤mhnall Gormeson appears to have submitted to the Government, and for about 8 years obediently ceased to quarrel with his neighbouring chiefs. However, by 1562, he is recorded among others Macdonalds, as receiving a remission form Queen Mary for the destruction and slaughter committed in the Maclean lands of Mull, Tiree and Coll. A and A Macdonald were unsure of the nature of these raids, though proposed that they may have something to do with a quarrel of Clann Iain Mh√≤ir and Maclean of Duart, regarding the Rinns of Islay. In 1568 he joined Somhairle Buidhe MacDh√≤mhnaill and his Irish campaigning. The next year he was feuding with the Mackenzies of Kintail.Macdonald; Macdonald 1900, 3: pp. 20‚Äì27. D√≤mhnall Gormeson died in 1585, and was succeeded by his oldest son, D√≤mhnall Gorm M√≤r. Late 16th century Lands possessed by the clan in the late 16th century. D√≤mhnall Gorm M√≤r was still a minor at the time of his father's death. The young chief was placed under the guardianship of his granduncle, Seumas of Castle Camus. In 1575, Seumas of Castle Camus agreed to pay the dues owing in the lands of North Uist, Sleat, and Trotternish, which had been owed to the Bishop of the Isles since the death of D√≤mhnall Gormson. This document shows that Seumas of Castle Camus and Clann GhillEasbaig Chl√®ireach (\\"the children of Gilleasbaig Cl√®ireach\\") had divided up the lands of the Macdonalds of Sleat. A and A Macdonald stated that Clann GhillEasbaig Chl√®ireach possessed themselves of Trotternish (with D√≤mhnall, son of Gilleasbaig as bailie of the region); while Seumas of Castle Camus held the bailiary of Sleat. For the year 1580, there is evidence that the possessors of clan estates were behind in their payments to the Bishopric of the Isles and the Iona Abbey ‚Äî so much so that an Act of Council and Session was passed ordering a summons against D√≤mhnall and √ôisdean, sons of Gilleasbaig Cleireach. The following year Seumas of Castle Camus and Clann GhillEasbaig Chl√®ireach were declared rebels, and forfeited for their failure to pay their dues, and their escheat was granted to the Bishop of the Isles. Castle Camus, known since the 17th century as Knock Castle, is located in Skye. It was once a Macleod castle though it was captured by the Macdonalds of Sleat in the early 15th century. The castle was finally abandoned in 1689. In 1585, D√≤mhnall Gorm M√≤r and his retinue were sailing to visit Macdonald of Dunivaig & the Glens of Antrim, but were forced to take shelter in Jura, which was then divided between Maclean of Duart and the chief of Clann Iain Mh√≤ir. Unluckily for the Macdonalds of Sleat, they landed on Maclean of Duart's portion of the island. That night they were attacked by a large body of Macleans, at a place called Inbhir a' Chnuic, and tradition states that 60 of them were slain and that the chief had only escaped because he had fallen asleep upon his galley. This conflict was only the beginning of a bloody feud between the Macdonalds of Sleat and the Macleans of Duart. It is not certain exactly what conflicts transpired, though by September 1585, James VI had written to Ruairidh M√≤r Macleod of Harris & Dunvegan, requesting him to assist Maclean of Duart against the Macdonalds who had done Maclean of Duart much injury and were threatening even more. By 1589, the feud had come to an end. The next year, the Sleat chief, and his brothers Gilleasbaig and Alasdair, his granduncle Seumas of Castle Camus, and √ôisdean, son of GillEasbaig Cl√®ireach, received a remission for all crimes committed against the Macleans of Duart. On the power of this dispensation, D√≤mhnall Gorm M√≤r, Sir Lachlann M√≤r Maclean of Duart, and Angus Macdonald of Dunivaig and the Glens of Antrim, were all induced to go to Edinburgh to consult the king. On their arrival they were apprehended and imprisoned, and the king and council imposed heavy fines as a condition of their release. D√≤mhnall Gorm M√≤r was to promise to give up ¬£4,000 and to pledge his obedience to the Scottish Government, as well as the Irish Government of Elizabeth I.Macdonald; Macdonald 1900, 3: pp. 27‚Äì38. In the summer of 1594, D√≤mhnall Gorm M√≤r and Ruairidh M√≤r Macleod of Harris & Dunvegan each sailed for Ulster at the head of 500 men each. They force was intended to support Aodh Rua √ì Domhnaill who was besieging Enniskillen Castle. Later in 1595 another expedition of Hebridians was made to support the Irish rebels against the forces of Elizabeth I. D√≤mhnall Gorm M√≤r raised a fighting force of 4,000 men and sailed to Ulster in a fleet of 50 galleys and 70 supply ships. The fleet was however blown off course and was attacked off Rathlin Island by 3 English frigates. 13 Macdonald galleys were sunk and another 12 or 13 were destroyed or captured off Copeland Island, at the entrance to Belfast Lough.Roberts 1999: p. 106. =Bitter feuding with Macleod of Harris & Dunvegan= Ruinous Teampull na Trionaid, in North Uist, near the site of the battle fought by the 40 Macleods and 15 Uistmen, in the late 16th century. Not long after returning from Ireland, a feud seems to have arisen between D√≤mhnall Gorm M√≤r and the chief of Clan Macleod, Ruairidh M√≤r. The Sleat chief had married the sister of the Macleod chief, and after some time sent her back to Macleod. Tradition has it that she was blind in an eye, and was mounted upon one-eyed horse, followed by a one-eyed dog, and accompanied by a one-eyed man.Macdonald; Macdonald 1900, 3: pp. 38‚Äì46. The Macleod chief was outraged and immediately had Trotternish ravaged. The Macdonalds of Sleat then retaliated by attacking Macleod possessions in Harris. This then led to Ruairidh M√≤r leading a warband of 60 men on a raid in North Uist.Roberts 1999: pp. 140‚Äì141. The Macleod chief's relative, Mac Dh√≤mhnaill Ghlais (\\"the son of D√≤mhnall the grey\\"), and 40 followers managed to possess themselves of the goods that the Uistfolk has hidden in Teampull na Trionaid (\\"trinity church\\"), at Carinish. However, the Macleods were attacked by a celebrated Clanranald warrior, named Dh√≤mhnall MacIain 'Ic Sheumais, in command of 15 men. The Macleods were outmanoeuvred by Dh√≤mhnall MacIain 'Ic Sheumais, and were slain almost to a man. Mac Dh√≤mhnaill Ghlais and a few of his followers fled for the island of Baleshare, but were run-down by some Uistmen and killed on the spot which ever since been known as Oitir Mhic Dh√≤mhnaill Ghlais (\\"the strand of the son of D√≤mhnall the grey\\"). The feud then became even more vicious, with both sides constantly raiding one another's territories, and the common clansfolk caught up in the middle of the warring were reduced to such an extent that they were even forced to eat dogs and cats to sustain themselves. The Macdonalds of Sleat later made one final strike against the Macleods. At the time, Ruairidh M√≤r was away seeking assistance from Archibald Campbell, 7th Earl of Argyll. Seizing upon the moment, D√≤mhnall Gorm M√≤r, led an all out invasion of Minginish and Bracadle, in the north of Skye. The Macdonalds took much spoil in the form of cattle and drove them to Coire na Creiche, overlooking the Cuillin hills. Here the Macleods mustered themselves, led by Alasdair, brother of the Macleod chief. The Battle of Coire Na Creiche lasted into the night and when the fighting subdued the Macleods were utterly defeated in what has since been the last clan battle to have ever have been fought on the Isle of Skye. By now, D√≤mhnall Gorm M√≤r and Ruairidh M√≤r's feud had escalated to such an extent that the Privy Council interfered, and ordered the two chiefs to disband their forces. The Macleod chief was ordered to surrender himself to the Earl of Argyll and the Sleat chief to George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly. Not long afterwards the two chieftains were reconciled with each other by mutual acquaintances. Through meetings and Eilean Donan and Glasgow, it was agreed that peace should be preserved. By the end of 1601, the bloody feud, between Ruairidh M√≤r and D√≤mhnall Gorm M√≤r, had come to an end. Early 17th century In 1608 after a century of feuding which included battles against the Clan Mackenzie and Clan Maclean all of the relevant Macdonald chiefs were called to a meeting with Lord Ochiltree who was the King's representative. Here they discussed the future Royal intentions for governing the Isles. The chiefs did not agree with the king and were all thrown into prison. Donald, the chief of the Macdonalds of Sleat, was incarcerated in the Blackness Castle. His release was granted when he at last submitted to the King. Donald died in 1616 and then Sir Donald Macdonald, his nephew succeeded as the chief and became the first Baronet of Sleat. Mid-17th century: civil war Sir James Macdonald, 2nd Baronet of Sleat, had just succeeded his father, in 1644, when civil war broke out in the British Isles. At the time the population of his estates was estimated to have been about 12,000, and in consequence he would have been a power to be reckoned with within the Highlands. According to A and A Macdonald, it seems that the baronet had not been very enthusiastic for the royal cause. In the autumn of 1644, when Alasdair MacColla arrived on the west coast, with Irish auxiliaries supplied by the Marquess of Antrim, he offered command to Sleat, yet Sleat declined the offer. Following the battle at Inverlochly, Montrose marched northwards. Shortly before the Battle of Auldearn, Montrose wrote to the Laird of Grant, informing him that, among others, 400 of the baronet's men had joined him. It is unknown who led the Macdonald of Sleat contingent, or what part they played in the campaign. A and A Macdonald considered it probably that the Sleat men fought under the command of the baronet's brother, Donald Macdonald of Castleton. The Sleat men continued with the campaigning following the defeat at the Battle of Philiphaugh. They took part in the siege of Inverness. When the king surrendered to the Scottish Army at Newark, and ordered Montrose to disband his forces, the Sleat men returned home to Skye and Uist. The baronet then made terms with the Committee of Estates, for himself and his principal followers who had taken part in the insurrection. The Duke of Hamilton marched down to recover the king. The Hebridean men had mustered in large numbers and were a part of the force which was defeated at the Battle of Preston in 1648. After the expedition had failed, the engagers were replaced in the Government by a new Committee of Estates, with Argyll at their head. In 1649, the baronet was cited to find caution for good behaviour. The baronet took no notice. In the summer of 1650, Charles II arrived in Scotland and was crowned at Scone. In expectation of Cromwell's advance, he appealed for support to his Highland supporters. The baronet was given a commission to levy a regiment on his estates in Uist and Skye-which was completed in January, 1651 and then marched to support the king. At the Battle of Worcester they formed a part of the Highland wing of the army. The Sleat men and the Macleods suffered severely in the battle, and only a remnant ever returned to their homes in the isles. After the defeat, the king fled to the continent, and the baronet made peace with Commonwealth of Scotland. Later the baronet refused to aid the Earl of Glencairn and others in 1653. He was hard pressed by his former allies, notably Glengarry who was a noted loyalist.Macdonald; Macdonald 1900, 3: pp. 58‚Äì69. The 2nd baronet died in 1678 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Donald Macdonald, 3rd Baronet of Sleat. Late 17th century In the decade following the death of James there is little record of the Macdonalds of Sleat. The chief, the 3rd baronet, was in ill health and seems to have lived a quiet life. In 1685, Argyll and others landed in the Western Isles and the Privy Council ordered Sir Donald to raise 300 men, and have them in Lochness in June. The insurrection however came to an abrupt end when Argyll was executed, and the Sleat men returned home before the end of June without seeing battle. When Dundee appealed to the Highland chiefs for their support to James VII, Sleat was among the first to join at the head of 500 men. The 3rd baronet however became ill just as he reached Lochaber, and the Sleat men were led by his son, Donald. At the Battle of Killiecrankie, the Sleat battalion was posted on the extreme left wing and suffered severely during the ensuing conflict. Among the slain were five of the principal officers, all cadets of the Macdonalds of Sleat. With the collapse of the rebellion, after the Highland men had returned home, the Government made an effort to treat with the Macdonalds of Sleat. While the baronet's son, who had led the clan in battle during the rising, was willing to consent under certain terms, the baronet remained stubborn and refused to communicate with William II's emissaries. After a while the Government took steps to force the chief into obedience, and two frigates were sent to Skye. After fruitless efforts at negotiating the frigates began shelling two of the chief's houses, burning them to the ground. Lowland troops then landed and fought with Sleat's men, though were forced back to their ships, suffering 20 dead. In time he came to peace with the Government, though it is unknown what were the manner or terms of the surrender. The Macdonalds of Sleat were on friendly terms with the garrison at Fort William, yet were at odds with other Macdonalds. In 1694, the chief and Macdonald of Camuscross made a complaint to the Supreme Council against, Alexander Macdonald, Younger of Glengarry; Aeneas Macdonald, his brother; and several others in Knoydart. Sleat and Camuscross claimed that the men had conceived \\"ane deadly hatred and evil will\\" against them, committing acts of violence against them and their possessions. The 3rd baronet died at Armadale in 1695 and was succeeded by his son, Donald Macdonald, 4th Baronet.Macdonald; Macdonald 1900, 3: pp. 69‚Äì79. 18th century Sir Donald Macdonald, 4th Baronet. He was also known as D√≤mhnall a' Chogaidh (\\"Donald of the war\\"). The 4th baronet distinguished himself as leader of the clan in his father's lifetime. From the beginning of the 18th century to the eve of the Jacobite rebellion in 1715, he lived in Glasgow, and had no contact with his clan in the Hebrides. During this period, according to A and A Macdonald, it would appear that he was in close contact with the Jacobite factions. The 4th baronet was not present at the Jacobite gathering at Braemar in September, when the standard was raised by the Earl of Mar. He travelled to Skye to raise his followers, which have been estimated from 700‚Äì900 men. In around the beginning of October, the baronet at the head of his men, joined the Earl of Seaforth at Brahan, and together proceeded to Alness. They put to the flight the Earl of Sutherland, with the Sutherland and Reay men, the Monros, Rosses and others. The baronet fell ill and returned to Skye, leaving command of the Sleat men to his brothers, James and William. When Government troops were sent to Skye the baronet then fled to North Uist. In April 1716, the baronet offered to surrender himself in term of the recently passed Act of Parliament, pleading that he was not healthy enough to travel to Inverlochy to surrender in person as the act required. However, when he failed to appear he was found guilty of high treason, and his estates were accordingly forfeited (however his titled does not appear to have been forfeited). The Commissioners of Forfeited Estates then proceeded to survey the baronet's estates. The survey found that the clan lands were in very poor condition and the people were in extreme poverty. For example, the tenants of North Uist had lost 745 cows, 573 horses and 820 sheep by a plague. The sea, too, had overflowed in parts of the land and destroyed many houses. The Skye estates were in similar condition with the loss of 485 horses, 1,027 cows and 4,556 sheep. The 4th baronet died in 1718 and was succeeded by his only son, Donald.Macdonald; Macdonald 1900, 3: pp. 79‚Äì82. Immediately following his father's death, the 5th baronet petitioned the Court of Session to rule that his father had indeed obeyed the Act of Parliament, by submitting his written surrender to the Government. The Court of Session ruled in favour of the baronet, and that he had not been forfeited of his estates. The Forfeited Estates Commissioners however appealed to the House of Lords, who subsequently ruled in favour of the appellants. The baronet died young, in 1720, and was succeeded by his uncle, James Macdonald of Oronsay. The 6th baronet had served the clan at the Battle of Killiecrankie, and led the Sleat men at the Battle of Sheriffmuir. Despite his support to the Jacobite cause, he supported George I in 1719 during the Spanish invasion which ended at the Battle of Glen Shiel. The 5th baronet outlived his nephew by only a few months, and died in 1720.Macdonald; Macdonald 1900, 3: pp. 82‚Äì84. Sir Alexander Macdonald of Sleat, 7th Baronet During the forfeiture of the clan's estates, the children of Sir James petitioned Parliament, in which they were successful, to receive ¬£10,000 out of the estate of the deceased Donald. At the same time, provisions were also made for the widow and children of Donald. In 1723, Kenneth Mackenzie, an Edinburgh advocate, purchased the three baronies of Sleat, Trotternish and North Uist for ¬£21,000. After deducting the provisions to the families of Donald and James, and the debts due to the wadsetters and others, the purchase price was nearly exhausted, and only ¬£4,000 went to the public. General Wade's report on the Highlands in 1724, estimated the clan strength at 1,000 men. In 1726. Kenneth Mackenzie and Sir Alexander Macdonald, 7th Baronet, the heir male, entered into a contract of sale, whereby the whole estate which had belonged to Sir Donald was sold to Sir Alexander. In 1727, Sir Alexander received a Crown charter for his lands, erecting the whole into a barony ‚Äì called the Barony of Macdonald. In 1739, the 7th baronet was involved in an infamous case of the kidnapping of men and women from the Hebrides, with the intent of selling them into slavery in North America (see relevant section below). The 7th baronet was notable among the Macdonald chiefs to have refused to join the 1745 Jacobite rebellion. His voiced his reasoning to Macdonald of Clanranald, stating the uprising was inopportune, with the chance of any success remote. A and A Macdonald noted that he would have also been grateful to the reigning House of Hanover, for the restoration of the clan's estates, which had been forfeited in the last rebellion. During the rebellion the 7th baronet raised two Independent Highland Companies for the Government cause. The 7th baronet died in Bernera, in 1746, and was buried at Kilmore, in Sleat. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Sir James.Macdonald; Macdonald 1900, 3: pp. 84‚Äì92. Sir Alexander Macdonald, 9th Baronet of Sleat and 1st Baron Macdonald of Slate The 8th baronet suffered from ill health as a child and while still comparatively young he was injured in a hunting accident. He attempted to regain his health in a warmer climate, when he left the British Isles for Italy, in 1765. His health, however, finally failed him in 1766, when he died in Rome, where he was buried. He was succeeded by his brother, Alexander, who was at the time, an officer in the Coldstream Guards.Macdonald; Macdonald 1900, 3: pp. 92‚Äì98. A and A Macdonald described the 9th baronet as being of a completely different temperament than that of his older brother. They described his tastes as \\"if note wholly English, at least entirely anti-Celtic\\". The 9th baronet raised the rents upon his estates, and evicted many of the poorer tenants from their holdings. During his chiefship, several tacksmen in Skye and Uist gave up their leases and emigrated. When Boswell and Johnson visited Skye in 1773, they encountered an emigrant ship, filled with tacksmen and their tenants, about to set sail. In 1776, the 9th baronet was made Lord Macdonald in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1777, he offered to raise a regiment on his estates, which the Government accepted. The regiment was named the 76th Regiment of Foot (Macdonald's Highlanders) and was 1,086 men strong; 750 of whom were from the baronet's lands on Skye and North Uist. The Macdonalds were well represented in the officers of the unit with men from the families of the Macdonalds of Glencoe, Morar, Boisdale and others.Maclauchlan; Wilson 1875: pp. 520‚Äì522. The regiment embarked for New York, in 1779, and served with distinction the American Revolutionary War. It returned home, and was disbanded in 1784. In 1794, the baronet raised three volunteer companies in Skye and Uist, for the defence of the country and relief of the regular army.Macdonald; Macdonald 1900, 3: pp. 98‚Äì101. He married Elizabeth Diana, eldest daughter of Godfrey Bosville of Gunthwaite, (in the County of York, England). He died comparatively young, in 1795, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Alexander Wentworth. 19th century to present Armadale Castle consists of a country house built in the 1790s and the remains of a burnt-out mock castle built in the 19th century. Today the estate is the site of the Clan Donald Centre and the Museum of the Isles. Godfrey James Macdonald, 8th Baron Macdonald bronze bust by sculptor Laurence Broderick Alexander died in 1795 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Alexander Wentworth Macdonald, 2nd Baron Macdonald. The 2nd baron lived for the most of his life in England and abroad, and consequently associated little with the tenants on his Hebridean estates. In 1798, he received permission from George III to raise a regiment on these estates; however the islanders were unwilling to join, and very considerable pressure was brought to bear upon them before the full complement of men was finally recruited. He erected the mansion house at Armadale, in Sleat, which was the principal seat of his family. The 2nd baron died unmarried in 1824 and was succeeded by his brother, Godfrey Bosville ‚Äì Macdonald, 3rd Baron Macdonald. The 3rd baron was baptised as Godfrey Macdonald, and legally changed his name to Godfrey Bosville, in 1814. After succeeding his brother in 1824, he changed his name to Godfrey Bosville ‚Äì Macdonald. The 3rd baron had served in the British Army prior to his succession and eventually rose to the rank of lieutenant-general, in 1830. He was also involved in a controversial dispute over the chiefship with Glengarry, which took place privately and publicly in the press. He died in 1832 and was succeeded by his second eldest son, Godfrey William Wentworth Bosville ‚Äì Macdonald, 4th Baron Macdonald. Under the 4th baron, vast portions of the clan inheritance were sold off, including North Uist and Kilmuir in Trotternish which included Duntulm Castle. He died in 1863 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Somerled James Brudenell Bosville ‚Äì Macdonald, 5th Baron Macdonald. The 5th baron died in 1874, aged 25, and was succeeded by his brother, Ronald Archibald Bosville ‚Äì Macdonald, 6th Baron Macdonald. The 6th baron was succeeded by his grandson, Alexander Godfrey Bosville ‚Äì Macdonald, 7th Baron Macdonald, who was in turn succeeded by his son, Godfrey James Macdonald, 8th Baron Macdonald. The 8th baron is the current chief of the name and arms of Macdonald and high chief of Clan Donald. =Illegitimacy and inheritance: modern chiefship= The current chiefs of Clan Donald and Clan Macdonald of Sleat both descend from the 3rd baron (Macdonald of Macdonald from his second son; Macdonald of Sleat from his eldest son). This reason for this is because the 3rd baron's eldest son, Alexander William Robert Macdonald, was considered to be illegitimate under English Law. In consequence, the eldest son could not inherit the title Baron Macdonald in the Peerage of Ireland. However, since the baronetcy (Baronet of Sleat) was a Scottish title, it was later ruled in 1910, that the eldest son could succeed to that instead. The island of C√†rna on Loch Sunart. Cara is the current chief's slogan. The 3rd baron had married an illegitimate daughter of William Henry, Duke of Gloucester, in 1803; and the 3rd baron's eldest son, Alexander William Robert Macdonald, was born before that, in 1800.Eyre-Todd 1923, 1: pp. 232‚Äì243. In 1832, Alexander William Robert Macdonald had his name legally changed to Alexander William Robert Bosville. Later in 1847, he inherited his father's Bosville estates in Yorkshire, England. In consequence, he remained in Yorkshire and his younger brother, Godfrey William Wentworth Bosville ‚Äì Macdonald, 4th Baron Macdonald, inherited the Scottish estates, titles, and chiefship. In 1910, Alexander Wentworth Macdonald Bosville, grandson of Alexander William Robert Bosville, obtained a decree from the Court of Session, which declared that Alexander William Robert Bosville was the eldest lawful son of the 3rd baron, and was accordingly the rightful heir. He then changed his name to Alexander Wentworth Macdonald Bosville ‚Äì Macdonald and was recognised as the 14th Baronet of Sleat, as such became the 22nd chief of Macdonald of Sleat. He died in 1933 and was succeeded by his son, Godfrey Middleton Bosville ‚Äì Macdonald of Sleat; who was in turn succeeded by his son, Alexander Somerled Angus Bosville ‚Äì Macdonald of Sleat; who was succeeded by Ian Godfrey Bosville Macdonald of Sleat, 17th Baronet ‚Äì the current chief of the clan. The chiefly family has been seated at Thorpe Hall, Rudston, East Yorkshire since the 3rd baron's eldest son inherited the Bosville estates in the 18th century. Forced emigration and slavery of clansfolk A restored blackhouse in Trotternish, Skye. Such houses were the dwellings of common Hebrideans during the era of the Highland Clearances. In 1739, the 1st baron was involved in the infamous kidnapping of men and women from Skye and Harris, with the intention of transporting them to the American Colonies and selling them into slavery. Other prominent men involved were Norman Macleod of Dunvegan (chief of Clan MacLeod), Donald Macleod of Berneray and his son Norman Macleod. During the night, Macleod of Berneray's son, Norman, arrived at Skye with a ship which has ever since been known as Soitheach nan Daoine (\\"the ship of the people\\"). He then proceeded to force on board men, women, and children, from all levels of society. As the ship sailed towards North America with its human cargo, it was driven by a storm onto the northern coast of Ireland and wrecked. The passengers were however rescued, and most of them settled on the lands of the Earl of Antrim, though a few, after great difficulties managed to return to their homes in the Hebrides. The 4th baron and chief of the Macdonalds of Sleat, presided over one of the more notable forced evictions of Highlanders during the era of the Highland Clearances.Campey 2005: p. 122. Those that drew particular controversy were the forced evictions of the small community of Sollas, in North Uist, in 1849 and 1850. During the 1849 evictions rioting broke out in which the Uist women played a prominent role.Richards 2007: p. 71. During the 1830s, tenants were cleared from his estates on Skye; and during the years 1838 and 1843, 1,300 people were removed from their homes in North Uist, to be replaced by sheep.Richards 1982: p. 420. Several of the Sollas rioters were arrested and eventually found guilty, yet the jury made the following written comments afterwards: Clan profile Heraldic standard of the current clan chief MacDonald of Sleat tartan. * Clan chief: The current chief of the clan is Sir Ian Godfrey Bosville Macdonald of Sleat, 17th Baronet of Sleat. He is the 25th chief of Clan Macdonald of Sleat. The chief's Gaelic designation is Mac √ôisdein (\\"son of √ôisdean\\"), which relates to his descent from √ôisdean of Sleat. The chief's sloinneadh (or pedigree) is: Shir Iain Gorraidh mac Alasdair Somhairle mhic Gorraidh 'ic Alasdair Uilleam 'ic Gorraidh 'ic Alasdair Uilleam 'ic Gorraidh 'ic Alasdair 'ic Alasdair 'ic Seumais 'ic D√≤mhnaill Breac 'ic Seumais Mhor 'ic D√≤mhnaill Gorm √íg 'ic GillEasbaig Cl√®irich 'ic D√≤mhnaill 'ic D√≤mhnaill Gorm 'ic D√≤mhnaill Gruamach 'ic D√≤mhnaill Gallach 'ic √ôisdean 'ic Alasdair 'ic D√≤mhnaill 'ic Eoin 'ic Aonghais √íg 'ic Aonghais Mh√≤r 'ic D√≤mhnaill 'ic Raghnaill 'ic Somhairle. * Chiefly arms: The current chief's coat of arms is blazoned: Quarterly first, argent a lion rampant gules armed and langued azure; second, Or a hand in armour fessways proper holding a cross crosslet fitch√©e gules; third, Or a lymphad sails furled and oars in action sable flagged gules; fourth, vert a salmon naiant in fess proper. Crest: A dexter forearm in armour fessways proper the hand proper holding a cross crosslet fitch√©e gules. Motto: Per mare per terras (by sea and land). Supporters: Two leopards proper collared Or. The chief's heraldic standard consists of: The arms of Macdonald of Sleat in the hoist and of two tracts argent and gules, upon which is depicted the crest in the first and second compartments, and two sprigs of common heather in the third compartment, along with the motto \\"per mare per terras\\" in letters gules upon two transverse bands argent. The coat of arms was matriculated at the Court of the Lord Lyon in 2000. The chief's motto (per mare per terras) translates from Latin as \\"by sea and land\\". The chief's slogan is carna, which is the name of a small island (C√†rna) on Loch Sunart. C√†rna was where Donald Balloch rallied the clan in 1431 before the Battle of Inverlochy, and also where Donald Dubh lead his last insurrection in 1545. * Clan member's crest badge: The crest badge suitable for members of the clan contains the chief's heraldic crest and motto. The crest is: A hand in armour fesswise holding a cross crosslet fitch√©e gules. The motto is: per mare per terras.George Way of Plean; Squire 2000: p. 174. * Clan badge: The clan badge or plant badge attributed to the clan is common heath. This plant is attributed to the other Macdonald clans and some other associated clans such as Clan MacIntyre and the Macqueens of Skye.Adam; Innes of Learney 1970: pp. 541‚Äì543. * Origin of the surname: There are many variations of the surname Macdonald. The surname is an Anglicisation of the Gaelic Mac Dhomhnuill, which is the patronymic form of Domhnall. This Gaelic personal name is composed of the elements domno \\"world\\" and val \\"might\\", \\"rule\\". According to Alex Woolf, the Gaelic personal name is probably a borrowing from the British Dyfnwal.Woolf 2007: p. xiii. * Pipe music: There are several pipe tunes specifically associated with the clan. Two pipe tunes were composed by Ewen Macdonald, for Sir James Macdonald, 8th Baronet. These were Cumha na Coise and Sir James Macdonald of the Isle's Salute.

It is a National Historic Site of Canada. Beginning in the 17th century, voyageurs would launch their canoes from this location to transport trade goods thousands of miles into the interior of North America lands. At that time the Lachine Rapids prevented large ships from going any further west along the Saint Lawrence River. A stone warehouse was erected in 1803 to store the furs gathered as a result of fur trade. It is now a Parks Canada museum dedicated to the history of this strategic location as a departure and arrival point for fur trading expeditions. The site is separate from Lachine Canal National Historic Site, with which it is inextricably connected. Montreal was the start of nearly all westward canoe routes. See Canadian canoe routes (early). Here furs were transferred from canoe to ship and trade goods from ship to canoe. A natural transfer point was the west end of Montreal Island since goods could be carted over a nine-mile road around the Lachine Rapids. Canoes usually left in May and returned in August. The Northwest Company built a stone warehouse here in 1803. It was used until 1859 when it was sold to the Sisters of Sainte Anne who used it as an employee residence. The Lachine Canal was built around the rapids in 1825. Sir George Simpson (administrator) had a mansion across the canal from the warehouse which was torn down in 1880.

The game was originally supposed to be a title for the PlayStation. It was ported and management aimed to release it in late 2001 as an Xbox launch title with band members from No Doubt doing various voice-overs and singer Gwen Stefani doing the voice for Malice. After a lengthy delay, cancellation, a change in publishers and an eventual revival, the game was released in 2004 and was met with mediocre reviews. This was Argonaut's final title released, as the company went out of business two months after the Xbox version came out in Europe.  Plot  The game is about the return of a goddess named Malice, who attempts to defeat the evil Dog God with the help of the Metal Guardian; the Keeper of Universe, who needs to find eight Logic Keys to locate the Dog God.  Characters  * Malice is a redheaded goddess. Malice tried to save her world from the Dog God, an evil villain that seeks to destroy world after world. Malice failed, dying after having her head bitten off by the Dog God. In the afterlife, Malice meets Death, who promptly kicks her out of the underworld, telling her that there is no room for a goddess in the afterlife. Back to life, Malice then meets the Metal Guardian. He tells her that the Dog God is currently attempting to destroy the entire universe, and he needs eight logic keys to track down the god. He finally gives Malice a giant club before sending her off on her quest spanning twenty different worlds. * The Metal Guardian is a giant clock who sends the newly resurrected Malice on her quest. He holds the knowledge of every and any living thing in the universe, except for Dog God, whom he needs eight logic keys to track. He asks Malice to find these logic keys so he can track down Dog God, which in turn would help Malice exact her revenge and save the universe. Much later in the game, the Guardian admits that he made a bet with the Siren Tree that Malice would only get four of the eight logic keys, only to be proven wrong. The Metal Guardian gives Malice her club, and also offers weapon upgrades and bonus features. After a certain point in the game, he will have a coin around him, unlocking bonus games. Four of these coins appear throughout the course of the game. * Death appears in the beginning cutscene, finding the recently deceased Malice in the underworld. He informs the amnesiac Malice that she was a goddess, and as a goddess may not be in the underworld. He tells her to leave and settle the score with the Dog God. Death appears if Malice loses all of her hit points, becoming a ghost. Death complains, saying that goddesses are \\"administrative nightmares.\\" * The Dog God is Malice's archenemy, and the primary antagonist of the game. He first appears in the beginning cutscene, where he bites off Malice's head. Without eight special logic keys, he cannot be tracked by the Metal Guardian. He travels from world to world, conquering and destroying. His ultimate goal is to destroy the entire universe.  Reception  The PlayStation 2 version of Malice received \\"mixed\\" reviews, while the Xbox version received \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\", according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

It was first incorporated under Royal Charter in 1701 as the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG) as a high church missionary organization of the Church of England and was active in the Thirteen Colonies of North America. The group was renamed in 1965 as the United Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (USPG) after incorporating the activities of the Universities' Mission to Central Africa (UMCA). In 1968 the Cambridge Mission to Delhi also joined the organization. From November 2012 until 2016, the name was United Society or Us. In 2016, it was announced that the Society would return to the name USPG, this time standing for United Society Partners in the Gospel, from 25 August 2016.Us ‚Äî Announcing the return of USPG (Accessed 15 August 2016) During its more than three hundred years of operations, the Society has supported more than 15,000 men and women in mission roles within the worldwide Anglican Communion. Working through local partner churches, the charity's current focus is the support of emergency relief, longer-term development, and Christian leadership training projects. The charity encourages parishes in United Kingdom and Ireland to participate in Christian mission work through fundraising, prayer, and by setting up links with its projects around the world. History Foundation and mission work in North America Seal of the \\"Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts\\" (1701) In 1700, Henry Compton, Bishop of London (1675-1713), requested the Revd Thomas Bray to report on the state of the Church of England in the American Colonies. Bray, after extended travels in the region, reported that the Anglican church in America had \\"little spiritual vitality\\" and was \\"in a poor organizational condition\\". Under Bray's initiative, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts was authorised by convocation and incorporated by Royal Charter on 16 June 1701. King William III issued a charter establishing the SPG as \\"an organisation able to send priests and schoolteachers to America to help provide the Church's ministry to the colonists\\". The new society had two main aims: Christian ministry to British people overseas; and evangelization of the non-Christian races of the world. The society's first two missionaries, graduates of the University of Aberdeen, George Keith and Patrick Gordon, sailed from England for North America on 24 April 1702. By 1710 the Society's charter had expanded to include work among enslaved Africans in the West Indies and Native Americans in North America. The SPG funded clergy and schoolmasters, dispatched books, and supported catechists through annual fundraising sermons in London that publicized the work of the mission society. Queen Anne was a noted early supporter, contributing her own funds and authorizing in 1711 the first of many annual Royal Letters requiring local parishes in England to raise a \\"liberal contribution\\" for the Society's work overseas. Missionary Rev. Roger Aitken (d. 1825), Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia) In New England, the Society had to compete with a growing Congregational church movement, as the Anglican Church was not established here. With resourceful leadership it made significant inroads in more traditional Puritan states such as Connecticut and Massachusetts. The SPG also helped to promote distinctive designs for new churches using local materials, and promoted the addition of steeples. The white church with steeple was copied by other groups and became associated with New England-style churches among the range of Protestant sects.Richard Lyman Bushman, The Refinement of America, Penguin, paperback 1993 Such designs were also copied by church congregations in the Southern colonies. From 1702 until the end of the American Revolution in 1783, the SPG had recruited and employed more than 309 missionaries to the American colonies that came to form the United States. Many of the parishes founded by SPG clergy on the Eastern seaboard of the United States are now listed among the historic parishes of the Episcopal Church. SPG clergy were instructed to live simply, but considerable funds were used on the construction of new church properties. The SPG clergy were ordained, university-educated men, described at one time by Thomas Jefferson as \\"Anglican Jesuits.\\" They were recruited from across the British Isles and further afield; only one third of the missionaries employed by the Society in the 18th century were English. Included in their number such notable individuals as George Keith, and John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, originally a movement within the Anglican Church. West Indies Through a charitable bequest received in 1710, aimed at establishing Codrington College, the SPG became a significant slave owner in Barbados in the 18th and early 19th centuries. With the aim of supplying funding for the college, the Society was the beneficiary of the forced labour of thousands of enslaved Africans on the Codrington Plantations. Many of the slaves died in captivity from such diseases as dysentery and typhoid, after being weakened by overwork. Although many educational institutions of the period, such as All Souls College, Oxford and Harvard University in Massachusetts benefitted from charitable bequests made by slave owners and slave traders, the ownership of the Codrington Plantations by the SPG and the Church of England generated considerable adverse controversy. In 1783, Bishop Beilby Porteus, an early proponent of abolitionism, used the occasion of the SPG's annual anniversary sermon to highlight the conditions at the Codrington Plantations and called for the SPG to end its connection with slave trade. The SPG did not relinquish its slave holdings in Barbados for decades, not until after the introduction in Parliament of the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833. At the February 2006 meeting of the General Synod of the Church of England, attendees commemorated the church's role in helping to pass the Slave Trade Act of 1807 to abolish the Atlantic trade. Delegates also voted unanimously to apologise to the descendants of slaves for the church's long involvement in and support of the slave trade and the institution. Tom Butler, Bishop of Southwark, confirmed in a speech before the vote, that the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts had owned the Codrington Plantations. Africa The Rev. Thomas Thompson, having first served as an SPG missionary in colonial New Jersey, established the Society's first mission outpost at Cape Coast Castle on the Gold Coast in 1752. In 1754 he arranged for three local students to travel to England be trained as missionaries at the Society's expense. Two died from ill health, but the surviving student, Philip Quaque, became the first African to receive ordination in the Anglican Communion. He returned to the Gold Coast in 1765 and worked there in a missionary capacity until his death in 1816. SPG missionary activities in South Africa began in 1821. The Society's work in the wider region made significant progress under the leadership of Bishop Robert Gray, expanding to Natal in 1850, Zululand in 1859, Swaziland in 1871 and Mozambique in 1894. During the period 1752‚Äì1906, the Society employed a total of 668 European and locally recruited missionaries in Africa. Global expansion The Society established mission outposts in Canada in 1759, Australia in 1793, and India in 1820. It later expanded outside the British Empire to China in 1863, Japan in 1873, and Korea in 1890. By the middle of the 19th century, the Society's work was focused more on the promotion and support of indigenous Anglican churches and the training of local church leadership, than on the supervision and care of colonial and expatriate church congregations. From the mid-1800s until the Second World War, the pattern of mission work remained similar: pastoral, evangelistic, educational and medical work contributing to the growth of the Anglican Church and aiming to improve the lives of local people. During this period, the SPG also supported increasing numbers of indigenous missionaries of both sexes, as well as medical missionary work. Women's missionary leadership To a limited degree, the Society was socially progressive from the mid 1800s in its encouragement of women from Britain and Ireland, including single women, to train and work as missionaries in their own right, rather than only as the wives of male missionaries. In 1866, the SPG established the Ladies‚Äô Association for Promoting the Education of Females in India and other Heathen Countries in Connection with the Missions of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. In 1895, this group was updated to the Women's Mission Association for the Promotion of Female Education in the Missions of the SPG. As part of the inclusion of more women in this organization, Marie Elizabeth Hayes was accepted into the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in 1905. She served as a member of the Cambridge Mission to Delhi, India, where she is known for her notable work as a Christian Medical Missionary. Her leadership in the medical field promoted more women's leadership in the Society's mission activities. The promotion of women's leadership within the Society's overseas mission activities was championed for many years by Louise Creighton, also an advocate for women's suffrage. At the peak of SPG missionary activity in India, between 1910 and 1930, more than 60 European women missionaries were at any one time employed in teaching, medical or senior administrative roles in the country. In Japan, Mary Cornwall Legh, working among Hansen's disease sufferers at Kusatsu, Gunma. She was regarded as one of the most effective Christian missionaries to have served in the Nippon Sei Ko Kai. Post-Second World War reorganisation The SPG, alongside the Church Mission Society (CMS), continued to be one of the leading agencies for evangelistic mission and relief work for the Churches of England, Wales, and Ireland in the decades following the Second World War. In the context of decolonization in Africa and India's independence in 1947, new models of global mission engagement between the interdependent member provinces of the Anglican Communion were required. In 1965 the SPG merged with the Universities' Mission to Central Africa (UMCA), and in 1968 with the Cambridge Mission to Delhi, to form the United Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (USPG). The Society found a new role in support of clergy training and in the movement of community development specialists, resources and ideas around the world church. Notable churches and educational institutions The list of SPG- and USPG-founded and sponsored church and educational institutions is geographically diverse. In some cases direct funding was supplied by the Society; in others SPG and USPG mission staff played prominent roles as founding ordained clergy, fundraisers, academic and administrative staff.

The United Society \\"seeks to advance Christian religion,\\" but also to leverage and support local Anglican church partners in their mission activities in a local community context. Project work includes community based health care provision for expectant mothers and for those suffering from HIV and AIDS, as well as education and work skills training programs. The charity is also involved in the training and development of Anglican lay and ordained church leaders and localized social advocacy on a diverse range of issues from gender based violence to climate change. The modern charity retains its strong funding and governance links with the Church of England, the Archbishop of Canterbury being the President of the charity. Projects in Africa still attract the largest percentage of the United Society's funding due to historic links and established endowments. In the financial year 2013, the charity supported church based initiatives in poverty relief, health, education and church leadership training in 20 different countries.

While originally presenting operas one at a time over a fall/winter season, it changed to a \\"festival\\" format in 2007. It now performs 3-4 operas per year each spring in Bass Performance Hall located in the downtown area of Fort Worth, Texas. History The Fort Worth Civic Opera Association, now known as Fort Worth Opera, was founded by three women, Eloise MacDonald Snyder and Betty Spain, both former opera singers, and pianist and composer Jeanne Axtell Walker. In seven months, the trio pulled together a full-scale production of Verdi's La Traviata, performed on November 25, 1946, in a building now known as the Cowtown Coliseum located in the Fort Worth Stockyards. The new association went through several management changes before it hired Rudolf Kruger as the musical director in 1955. Under Kruger's guidance, Fort Worth Opera went on to become an arts company of note, especially during the 1960s, when it helped launch the careers of Pl√°cido Domingo and Beverly Sills. In 1982, the Fort Worth Opera executive board moved to reduce Kruger's responsibilities and began searching for a new managing director. The next several years proved to be difficult for the company, both financially and administratively. It hired and terminated two managing directors that were unable to generate the ticket sales and financial stability of Kruger. In 1991, Fort Worth Opera hired William Walker, a former singer with a distinguished career as one of Metropolitan Opera's principal baritones and as a recurring guest on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. Under Walker's direction, the company was able to return to financial stability and artistic success. In 1998, the executive board, unhappy with Walker's administrative management and direction, offered him a severance package, which he initially accepted. Later at a meeting of the full board, his supporters rallied to overturn the executive committee's decision. The company lost many important board members and donors as a result. The remaining board hired an executive director to help with administrative issues and Walker retained his position until his retirement in June 2002.Jones, Jan L.

At the end of the episode \\"Proteus\\", she is offered a promotion to the rank of captain but elects to remain a lieutenant. Gerry Anderson described the re-imagined character as an \\"incredibly efficient assistant\\" to Colonel White. The character's appearance was loosely modelled on \\"Jinx\\" Johnson (played by Halle Berry) in the James Bond film Die Another Day (2002). She was voiced by Jules de Jongh. Reception When it was repeated on British television in 1993, Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons drew criticism for its use of the codenames \\"White\\" (for the benevolent Colonel White) and \\"Black\\" (for the villainous Captain Black), with some commentators viewing these opposing colour designations as racially charged and politically incorrect.Bentley 2001, p. 122. Gerry Anderson responded to these allegations by pointing out that the series features heroic non-white characters in the form of Green, Melody Angel and Harmony Angel. Green's original voice actor, Cy Grant, believed that Captain Scarlet had positive multicultural value and regarded it as spiritually allegorical. On black-and-white dualism, he argued that \\"the 'darkness' of the Mysterons is most easily seen as the psychological rift ‚Äî the struggle of 'good' and 'evil' ‚Äî of the Western world as personified by Colonel White and his team. Dark and light are but aspects of each other. Incidentally, green is the colour of nature that can heal that rift.\\" He also discussed the idea of Lieutenant Green being an African trickster hero. The progressiveness of Green's character has been well received. Mike Fillis of Cult Times magazine praised the Andersons' decision to make a black character Cloudbase's \\"second-in-command\\", while The Daily Telegraph referred to the character as a \\"black defender of planet Earth\\". Kurt Barling, who wrote an obituary on Grant for The Independent, described Green as \\"one of the first positive black fictional characters in children's television\\". He praised the way that Grant delivered the character's lines, stating that his \\"mellifluous tones\\" gave Green a \\"serene and heroic quality\\". The authors of The Rough Guide To Cult TV argue that the casting of Green as a main character in the original Captain Scarlet was a result of shifting \\"TV politics\\" during the 1960s, pointing out that Gerry Anderson had been frustrated in his attempts to include prominent non-white characters in his earlier series. In a 2008 article on the portrayal of women professionals in television, Yvonne Cook of the Open University noted that one episode of New Captain Scarlet shows the female Lieutenant Green fending off the persistent advances of a male guest character. Cook cited this episode as an example of how \\"even programmes aimed at young children can contain quite subtle gender stereotyping\\".

Industrial models kept the 248/258/268/278/288 model numbers but had \\"H pattern gearshift\\". IH Doncaster supplied transmissions to the USA (initially Louisville) which were built into tractors with the same model designations as the Doncaster produced tractors. Also some were specifically for US only models (240/250/260/270?). Some had torque converter transmissions. They also supplied transmissions to Kimco in Japan (joint venture IH/Komatsu) who built them into tractors and designed their own four wheel drive axle. This axle was later imported and fitted mainly to 84 series tractors by Doncaster. Designed for traction in paddy field use it proved not to be robust enough to carry the weight when front loaders were fitted. IH Doncaster also supplied transmissions for the Volvo BM T500, 2200, 2204, 2250 and 2254 tractors. Balers were assembled in Liverpool, but this was transferred to Carr Hill Works in Doncaster models were: B46/B47/430/440/435/445. Carr Hill also assembled Lodestar trucks in the mid/late 1960s. The Wheatley Hall Road factory also produced agricultural crawler tractors BTD5/BTD6/BTD8/BTD20 in red as well as yellow CE bulldozer and loader versions. Wheatley also produced backhoe loaders (3400/3500/260) and Payloaders H25/500 Payloader/H30/H50 & H65.

He is perhaps best known for representing Eric Cantona on charges of a \\"flying kick\\" assault of an opposition spectator in 1995. Life and career Poole was educated at Ampleforth College, and read Classics at Jesus College, Oxford from 1957 to 1962, being elected JCR President in 1960. He was made an honorary Fellow of the College in 1997. After a postgraduate diploma in science at UMIST, he worked in industry for some years before changing to a legal career. He was called to the Bar by Middle Temple in 1968, where he became a bencher in 1992. He played rugby for Oxford University (though missing out on a Blue), London Irish, the Bar and the Northern Circuit. As a barrister, he took on a mix of criminal and civil cases. He was appointed a Queen's Counsel in 1984, after which he concentrated mostly on criminal work, mainly for the prosecution. As a lawyer for the defence, his scientific background enabled him to be at the forefront of early challenges to DNA evidence. In March 1995, Poole was instructed to represent by Manchester United star footballer Eric Cantona when Cantona was charged with assault on an opposition supporter. Playing against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park in a Premier League match, Cantona was taunted by a spectator, Matthew Simmons. Enraged, Cantona launched a flying kick at Simmons. Brought before Croydon Magistrates' Court, Cantona was sentenced to two weeks' imprisonment, but then given bail pending an appeal and finally served 120 hours of community service. Poole was a Crown Court Recorder from 1982 until 1995, when he was appointed as a High Court judge in the Queen's Bench Division and received the customary knighthood. He presided over several notorious trials, including that of the paedophile Sidney Cooke in 1999, and the murderer John Paul Allan in 2003. As a result of adverse press coverage, he halted the first trial of Leeds United players Lee Bowyer and Jonathan Woodgate, and two friends, on 11 April 2001. The defendants were charged with affray and grievous bodily harm after an Asian student, Safraz Najeib, was assaulted in Leeds city centre. Poole held that an article in the Sunday Mirror created a \\"substantial risk\\" of prejudice to the trial; its editor, Colin Myler, resigned three days later. At a retrial later that year, Woodgate was convicted and sentenced to community service, but Bowyer was acquitted. Poole never retired, continuing to work until shortly before his death in June 2006. Affiliations He chaired the Association of Lawyers for the Defence of the Unborn from 1985 to 1991. He became a bencher of Middle Temple in 1992 and was made an honorary Fellow of Jesus College, Oxford, in 1997. Death He died in 2006, aged 68, of undisclosed causes, survived by his wife, the former Pauline O'Flaherty, and their four sons William, Alex, Gareth and Simon.

This dish is traditionally made of peas and/ or corn, with grease (bear or pork) and a thickening agent (bread or flour) that makes up the base of the stew. Pemmican and maple sugar were also commonly added to the mixture. Rubaboo that is made by the Plains Metis is often made with pemmican, rabbit, prairie chicken or sage hen and a wide variety of wild vegetables such as wild parsnip (lii naavoo) onion, turnip, and asparagus that can all be added to the food with preference. The thickened mixture was later re-served as ‚Äúrowschow‚Äù (re- chaud). Sometimes, It is occasionally spelled Rubbaboo. Other sources describe it as consisting primarily of boiled pemmican, with thickening agents added when available.Nute, Grace Lee.The Voyageur. Minnesota Historical Society, , p. 55  Origins  The etymology of the word is a blend of the French word roux (a thickener used in gravies and sauces) with the word for soup (\\"aboo\\") from an Algonquian language, such as Anishnaabe naboo. Although pemmican can be added to the stew, Rubaboo and pemmican remain separate dishes, but are culturally linked closely to each other in Metis history.

The lower airfoil is rigid. The upper airfoil is flexible. At high angle of attack the flow over the lower airfoil will cause the airflow to bend up and create an upward force at the lower surface of the upper airfoil. This upward force will cause the flexible section to be pushed upward. The flexible wing section is held at points A and B. The trailing edge is rigid and can rotate about point B. Due to this effect the camber of the airfoil is increased, and hence the lift it creates is increased.

It gets its name because the cards are laid out in such a way that they form a gate. Average players can expect to win 99% of their games. Rules First, two columns of five cards are dealt face up. These act as the reserve or \\"gate posts.\\" Then, between these columns, two rows of four cards are dealt, again face-up. These compose the \\"rails\\" or the tableau. The spaces for the foundations are allotted over the first row of cards. The object of the game, like many solitaire games, is to find the aces, place then onto the foundations, and build each of them up by suit to kings. The cards in the rails are available for play, to be placed on the foundations or onto other cards in the rail. The cards in the rails are built down by alternating color (a card with a red suit over a one with a black suit, and vice versa). Spaces in the rails are filled using cards from the gate posts. If the cards in the gate posts are used up, the top card of the wastepile, or the next card in the stock if there is no wastepile, can be used to fill spaces. The gate posts are never replenished. Generally, one card can be moved at a time, and the most prevalent rule regarding moves of sequences is that these can be moved as a whole. The stock can be dealt one card at a time to a wastepile. The top card of which is available for play, either to be placed in on the foundations or on the rails, or to fill a gap on the rails. However, once the stock runs out, there are no redeals. The game ends soon after the stock runs out. The game is won when all cards are played to the foundations. Variants Several variant ways of playing Gate Solitaire exist, including rules about which cards can be moved, and whether a redeal can be added. One common rule-set disallows moving sequences of cards, effectively making the game harder.Marks and Harrod, Card Games Made Easy. ) References See also * Canfield * List of solitaires * Glossary of solitaire Single-deck patience card games Reserved packers ","title":"Gate (solitaire)"},{"id":"6454726","text":"Hans Kronberger CBE, FRS (28 July 1920 ‚Äì 29 September 1970) was a British physicist. During his career with the UK Atomic Energy Authority he made important contributions to the development of the British thermonuclear bomb and nuclear power engineering, especially in the field of isotope separation. Early life Hans Kronberger was born of Jewish parents in Linz, Austria, where his father was a leather merchant. Kronberger attended the Akademische Gymnasium in Linz, matriculating in Mathematics, Latin, Greek and German; he was a brilliant scholar. After the Anschluss, the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938, Kronberger fled to Britain, arriving at Victoria Station with ¬£10 and his school reports. He set about gaining entry to a university and was accepted at King's College, Newcastle, then a college of Durham University to read mechanical engineering. Following the fall of France, in May 1940 Kronberger was classified as a \\"friendly enemy alien\\" and interned on the Isle of Man. In July 1940, Kronberger, along with some 2500 refugees, was deported to Australia on board HMT Dunera; during the voyage he and others were subjected to ill treatment. In Australia, he was interned first at a camp in Hay, New South Wales, then from May 1941 at Tatura in Victoria. He was released and returned to Britain in 1942. He was tutored by refugee scientists at the camps and it was mainly due to this experience that he changed his course to physics on resuming his studies at Newcastle. He graduated in 1944 with the Stroud Prize in Physics. Career In 1944 he moved to Birmingham University, joining Francis Simon's team in the Tube Alloys Project, the British programme to develop an atomic bomb. His PhD on isotope separation was completed in 1948. He then moved to the newly formed Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell, where he continued to work on the separation of the isotopes of uranium, initially by gaseous diffusion and then using high speed centrifuges. In 1951 he moved to Capenhurst, where a large scale diffusion plant was being constructed. In two years, he was promoted to head of the Capenhurst laboratories, and then in 1958 he succeeded Leonard Rotherham as director of research and development of the industrial group of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority. In 1952, Britain committed itself to the development of a thermonuclear weapon. Kronberger's work on the separation of lithium isotopes was essential to the construction of the first warheads, which were tested at Christmas Island in 1957. A series of promotions within the UKAEA followed; he became Scientist in Chief of the Reactor Group in 1962 and the Member for Reactor Development of the UKAEA in 1969. Some of his work remains classified to this day, but there are many tributes to his inspiring leadership. He became involved with the promotion of peaceful uses of atomic energy and was a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency. He contributed to feasibility studies on desalination of sea water and lectured on hydrostatic extrusion. Personal life The Jewish population of Linz was expelled in July 1938. Kronberger's mother was killed at Schloss Hartheim and his sister was gassed at Auschwitz. His father survived imprisonment in the concentration camp at Theresienstadt. Kronberger became a naturalised British citizen in 1946. In 1951 he married Joan Hanson, a scientific assistant at Harwell, a widow with a young son, Paul; together they had two daughters, Zo√´ and Sarah. Joan was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 1952 and died in 1962. Kronberger was a talented pianist, and also a skilled mountaineer and skier.

He grew up with the Black Prince at Windsor Castle, at a time of rebuilding by the Royal architect William of Wykeham. After a scandalous first marriage, to Agnes, daughter of Mauger Vavasour of Yorkshire, which ended in divorce, the Prince intended Brocas to marry his cousin, Joan, the Fair Maid of Kent but when Joan said she loved Edward, he decided to marry her himself. As compensation, he found Brocas another great heiress, Mary des Roches, a kinswoman of Peter des Roches, Bishop of Winchester. Brocas fought with Edward at the Battles of Poitiers, Cr√©cy and N√°jera. After the Peace of Bretigny, he helped to settle Aquitaine and was appointed Constable there. It has been claimed that he captured and chopped off the head of a King of Morocco, but the story seems to be apocryphal. In England, Brocas acted as Queen's Chamberlain to Anne of Bohemia. He had residences at Clewer Brocas Manor in Berkshire, and at Beaurepaire in Sherborne St John and Roche Court near Fareham, both in Hampshire. He was a great patron of Southwick Priory. He served as High Sheriff of Wiltshire for 1382 and married Katharine, widow of Hugh Tyrell. Brocas was MP for Wiltshire in 1391 and then MP eight times for Hampshire. He married three times and had at least five children, amongst them, Sir Bernard Brocas the Younger, who was executed for treason in 1400. Brocas died on 20 September 1395 and was buried in St Edmund's Chapel in Westminster Abbey, where his fine effigial monument can still be seen today.

The early mines were Baro Dhemo and Sundarchak. Those mines are now defunct and they were closed about eighty years ago after being in operation for about seventy odd years. As those mines started to dry up, new virgin plots were excavated, some of which extended beyond the Damodar River into Purulia district and beyond River Barakar into the Nirsa of Dhanbad district in Jharkhand. One of the deepest mines in Asia, Chinakuri 1 and 2, is located in this region. It is situated below the surface and inclines under the Damodar River extending for some into Purulia district. This mine boasts of a regular underground train service to ferry workers from the mine shaft to the coal face. Mines safety With hectic operations in the mines, accidents occurred frequently leading to loss of life. The government felt the need to regulate the mining process. Directorate of Mines Safety was set up for this purpose. It inspected the mining procedure with firm laws and imposed hard penalties for non-compliance. It resulted in a strong control on accidents and loss of life was reduced. Presently, the zonal office of the Directorate General of Mines Safety is located at Sitarampur.Director General of Mines Safety However, the mining community could not tackle the onslaught of nature, which came in the form of rain and floods. Mines were flooded and people got trapped inside. So a force was formed to help in rescue operations. The Mines Rescue Station was formed at Sitarampur and the mining community was taught what to do in such situations. Being an old mining area it was a pioneer in many fields. The ideas subsequently spread to other areas. Currently, six main rescue stations and eighteen rescue rooms with refresher training facilities have been established and are functioning in various subsidiaries of Coal India Limited. PIB Press Release A small captive explosive manufacturing factory was established at Sitarampur for the supply of dynamite for solid blasting in open cast mines. The unit was in operation from around 1914 to 1935. The reason for the closure of this unit was the supply of dynamite to the revolutionaries who created hell for the ruling British. The authorities relocated the unit at various places far from the mining region and supply was strictly regulated. Demographics Language It mainly consists of Bengali, Gujarati, Marwari, and Hindi-speaking people from Bihar and Jharkhand.Bengali is official language in Sitarampur. Economy Coal Sitarampur is mainly a coal-mining centre, hence many people in Sitarampur and Neamatpur work in the various Coal Mines of Eastern Coalfields Limited. Some People also work in the Office of the Directorate General of Mines Safety [DGMS] and in the Indian Railways. Most of the Marwaris in the town are involved in some Business or the other. Nearest police station is Neamatpur Investigation Centre. Collieries in the Sitarampur Area of Eastern Coalfields are: Mithani, Bejdi, Dhemomain, Narsamuda, BC Incline and Patmohana. As per ECL website telephone numbers, operational collieries in the Sodepur Area in 2018 are: Bejdih Colliery, Chinakuri I & II Colliery, Chinakuri III Colliery, Dhemomain Incline Colliery, Dhemomain Pit Colliery, Dubeswary Colliery, Methani Colliery, Mouthdih Colliery, Narsamuda Colliery, Parbelia Colliery, Patmohana Colliery and Sodepur Colliery.

St. Patricks High School, St. Vincents School,and Loreto Convent in Asansol and The Assembly of God Church School at Sodepur. Higher Education facilities like Colleges are available nearby here. Kulti college is one of them. In this connection Tagore Institute of Sitarampur deserves special mention, as it marks a landmark of the place, although it now stands in a desolate and dilapidated condition in the western end of the Railway playground. The Tagore Institute was in the past a hub of cultural activities, and dramatic performances and cinema shows used to be staged on festival seasons. Seasonal games of football and cricket were played in the playground on regular basis. By the psychological law of association the name of Akhil Memorial Challenge Shield (Now defunct) comes to mind. Durgapuja is held here on a permanent structure erected close to Tagore Institute, for continuous 74th year There is another playground nearby called \\"Paltandanga\\" near Neamatpur where circus and sporting activities like cycle race used to be held during winter months. Incidentally, during the Second World War large platoons of American and British soldiers used to set up tents for sojourn in \\"Paltandanga\\", hence the name of the ground, in Bengali 'paltan' being the corrupt and distorted form of English word 'platoon'. During the great war Belrui school was used as a temporary storehouse of foodgrains for buffer stock, and classes remained suspended for a pretty long time. Then there is Railway Vidyapith (Primary School) founded in 1954 close to the Rly health centre, which has been subsequently upgraded up to class VIII. As a result of steady expansion of population and urban agglomarization new colony has come up in the area which was previously known as loco colony towards Asansol. Ramkrishna mission school is very renowned school in Asansol. Now Asansol has an engineering college, which also runs certificate courses. This college is located on the national highway(NH-19). Kanyapur Polytechnic, Asansol ITI are also there. Transport As movement of coal by trains increased considerably a new railway line, the Grand Chord, was laid from Sitarampur to Mughalsarai. At that time, Sitarampur railway station boasted of the largest steam locomotive shed and the second largest coal moving yard in the country. Now the steam loco shed is gone as steam engines were phased out. The Howrah-Delhi rail track separates into the Main and Grand Chord lines at Sitarampur and rejoins at Mughalsarai. Hence many important trains on the Howrah - Delhi passes through and have stoppages at Sitarampur. Some major trains providing stoppage at Sitarampur are Dhanbad - Howrah Coalfield Express and Black Diamond Express, Kathgodum Express, Mithila Express etc. Many local and passenger trains connect Sitarampur with Dhanbad, Gomoh, Chittaranjan, Asansol and Bardhaman and to Madhupur and Deoghar in Deoghar district of Jharkhand and various other parts of Jharkhand and Bihar. Road connectivity to Sitarampur is provided through the Grand Trunk Road which passes through the adjacent town of Neamatpur. One can go to Kolkata, Durgapur, Barakar and Dhanbad easily travelling by the Grand Trunk Road. One can also go to Purulia via Dishergarh and to Chittaranjan after reaching the Grand Trunk Road at Neamatpur. Regular Minibus services are available from Asansol City Bus Terminus, Barakar, Chittaranjan and Dishergarh. All the mini buses provide a stoppage at Neamatpur.

Well known for his choral compositions, he has also established himself as a leading composer of chamber music. Education Born into a family of teachers in Pretoria, Niel attended high school in Pietersburg (now Polokwane) in South Africa. After matriculating in 1980 he studied at the University of Pretoria, where he attained the BA Ed(Mus), BMus(Hons) cum laude and an MMus in Composition. In 1997 he completed his Doctorate in Musicology at the University of South Africa with a doctoral dissertation on the life and works of the British composer Gerald Finzi. Career After his military service in the old South African Defence Force, he joined the staff of Pretoria Boys High School, a prominent South African public school, where he is currently head of the Music Department and conductor of both the orchestra and Dixie Band. While he is a full-time teacher, he dedicates much of his time to composition. Van der Watt has also arranged a significant amount of traditional African music for choir as well as setting leading Afrikaans poetry to music, including the works of Antjie Krog and N.P. van Wyk Louw. Influences While van der Watt's early works show the influence of late romanticists like Rachmaninoff and Faur√©, his mastery of harmony and counterpoint reveals a deep understanding of and reverence for the great master Johann Sebastian Bach. This, offset by a keen appreciation for jazz, rock and traditional African music, has made his oeuvre especially distinctive. A key work illustrating this is the De-Commercialised American Christ's Mass (1995), which employs variations on popular Christmas carols to form a witty yet reverent incarnation of the Roman Catholic Low Mass. Trivia *Van der Watt originally joined the staff of Pretoria Boys High School as an English teacher. *Although he is a Protestant, he has composed a large amount of Roman Catholic liturgical music, including two Masses and a Requiem. *He is an avid fan of the Beatles, Billy Joel and ABBA as far as popular music is concerned and is known for his dislike of Beethoven. *In 2008 he wanted to prove to Pretoria Boys High School's Symphony orchestra that he did not dislike Beethoven at all and arranged Beethoven's 2nd movement of the Pathethique Sonata for the orchestra. *His works have been performed in places as far flung as Russia, R√©union and Hong Kong. *He considers himself to be a poly-stylist.

It was published in two distinct volumes. Volume 1 (1987-1989) The title's first run was from 1987‚Äì1989, released in alternating months with the regular Eastman & Laird book, with Ryan Brown and Jim Lawson handling the writing and artwork. Although only seven issues of Volume 1 of Tales were published, it provided an opportunity to expand the TMNT character roster to include characters such as Nobody, Leatherhead, Rat King, Complete Carnage, and Radical ‚Äì most of which went on to feature in the main title. Tales is also notable for borrowing a unique tradition that originated in Creepy magazine: an opening splash page would feature an introduction by a TMNT character and conclude with the ominous line, \\"Let me tell you a story\\". This page also served as a showcase of sorts for a variety of guest artists. The title ceased publication in 1989 when the TMNT became a licensed property. Jim Lawson moved to Mirage's ongoing TMNT series while Ryan Brown shifted toward art and design work for TMNT licensees, including the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures title from Archie Comics. Volume 2 (2004-2010) Sixteen years later, under the direction of Stephen Murphy, a relaunch of the series began publication in January 2004. The new Tales of the TMNT (as the covers read) focused on events that occur throughout the Turtles' lives, including some of the \\"lost\\" thirteen years occurring between TMNT Volumes 2 and 4. Issue #25 featured the return of the original Tales creative team of Brown and Lawson. This revived title maintained the tradition of including a \\"Let me tell you a story\\" splash page at the beginning of every issue, in homage to its 1980s predecessor. In May 2010, the second volume ended its run with a total of 70 issues, ten times as many as its predecessor. Collected books The original series' entire run has been collected twice as trade paperbacks, first in 1989 and again in 2007. Each version of the trade features new story contents, with the 1989 edition featuring a new 10 page back-up story at the end written & drawn by Jim Lawson. The 2007 edition features a new 27-page story by Lawson entitled \\"Spinal Tapped\\" with this story taking place after issue #7 and a 4-page epilogue by Murphy & Lawson. The 2007 edition does not collect the new back-up story from the 1989 edition. Additionally, the 2007 edition also features new opening splash pages, omitting the original opening splash pages completely. Five volumes of the Tales of the TMNT Volume 2 series have been collected by Mirage Studios from 2006-2008, selecting random issues, or based on linked themes/characters. IDW Publishing would later also collect issues of both volumes of Tales of the TMNT (reprinted in color) upon the sale of the Ninja Turtles property sold to Viacom post-2009, upon acquiring the comic book licensing rights.

He was born and died in Bologna. Biography Born in Bologna, Righi was educated in his home town, taught physics at Bologna Technical College between 1873 and 1880, and left to take up the newly established chair of physics at the University of Palermo. He was professor of physics at the University of Padua (1885‚Äì89) and later returned to a professorship at the University of Bologna. Righi's early research, conducted in Bologna between 1872 and 1880, was primarily in electrostatics. He invented an induction electrometer, with the help of Dr. Matthew Van Schaeick of the Humboldt University of Berlin, in 1872, capable of detecting and amplifying small electrostatic charges, formulated mathematical descriptions of vibrational motion, and discovered magnetic hysteresis in 1880. Whilst ordinary professor in physics at the University of Palermo, he studied the conduction of heat and electricity in bismuth. From 1885 to 1889 in Padua, he studied the photoelectric effect. Towards the end of 1889 he was called to the University of Bologna, his home city, where he worked for the rest of his life on subjects such as the Zeeman effect, 'Roentgen rays', magnetism and the results of Michelson's experiments.A. Righi, La Materia radiante e i raggi magnetici, Zanichelli (1909) spark transmitter (left) and coherer detector Righi used in his experiments His most well known work is his 1890s investigations of Hertzian waves (radio waves), which had been discovered in 1887. In 1894 Righi (along with Indian physicist Jagadish Chandra Bose) was the first person to generate microwaves, producing 12 GHz microwaves with a metal ball spark oscillator, and detecting them with a dipole antenna and spark gap. He used his spark transmitter and detector at wavelengths of 20, 7.5 and 2.5 centimeters (frequencies of 1.5, 4 and 12 GHz) to perform classic optics experiments with microwaves, using quasioptical components, prisms and lenses made of paraffin wax and sulfur and wire diffraction gratings to demonstrate refraction, diffraction, and polarization of these short radio waves, providing experimental confirmation of James Clerk Maxwell's 1873 theory that radio waves and light were both electromagnetic waves, differing only in frequency. His work L'ottica delle oscillazioni elettriche (1897), which summarised his results, is considered a classic of experimental electromagnetism. In 1903 Righi wrote a book on wireless telegraphy.A. Righi, La Telegrafia Senza Filo (Wireless Telegraphy) (1901). See also A. Righi, Le nuove vedute sull'intima struttura della materia - Discorso pronunciato in Parma il 25 ottobre 1907 nel Congresso della Societ√† italiana pel progresso delle scienze. Righi influenced the young Guglielmo Marconi the inventor of radio, who visited him at his lab. Marconi invented the first practical wireless telegraphy radio transmitters and receivers in 1894 using Righi's four ball spark oscillator in his transmitters. By 1900 he had begun to work on X-rays and the Zeeman effect. He also studied gas under various conditions of pressure and ionization, and worked on improvements to the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment from 1918.A.

Biography  Gray was born in Bishopwearmouth, north east England, the 12th child and son of Robert Gray, Bishop of Bristol, who made him deacon in Wells Cathedral on 11 January 1834. His first parish was at Whitworth. In 1845 he became the vicar of Stockton-on-Tees. As a priest he was interested in mission, and was local secretary for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. In 1847, he was consecrated Bishop of Cape Town in Westminster Abbey, along with three bishops for Australia, and arrived in his diocese, the boundaries of which were undefined, in February the following year. Soon after arriving he set out on a journey to explore his diocese, accompanied by James Green, who was to be rector of Pietermaritzburg in the Colony of Natal. On reaching Grahamstown he ordained William Long, with whom he was to come into conflict later. In 1849, he visited St Helena, and in 1850 set out on another tour of the mainland, reaching as far as Pietermaritzburg. This journey convinced him that the division of the diocese was necessary. He returned to England to arrange for this, and in 1853 he resigned his diocese and received fresh letters patent for a smaller Anglican Diocese of Cape Town, while two new bishops were consecrated: John William Colenso as Bishop of Natal and John Armstrong as Bishop of Grahamstown. Robert Gray was married on 6 September 1836 to Sophy Myddleton, the daughter of county squire Richard Wharton Myddleton of Durham and Yorkshire, and founded Diocesan College, or Bishops as it is commonly known, in Rondebosch, Cape Town, in 1849. A notable part of his life concerned his feud with Colenso about Colenso's alleged heretical opinions. Gray and his wife looked after the children of Mgolombane Sandile, including his daughter Emma, aiming to provide influence over the Gaika people. Robert Gray's son, Rev. Charles Gray, M.A., edited the book 'Life of Robert Gray'.

The center areas of two rectangular fields are identical, but appear different because the background fields are different. The Chubb illusion is an optical illusion or error in visual perception in which the apparent contrast of an object varies substantially to most viewers depending on its relative contrast to the field on which it is displayed. These visual illusions are of particular interest to researchers because they may provide valuable insights in regard to the workings of human visual systems. An object of low-contrast visual texture surrounded by a field of uniform visual texture appears to have higher contrast than when presented on a field of high-contrast texture. This illusion was observed by Charles Chubb and colleagues and published in 1989. An empirical explanation of the Chubb illusion was published by Lotto and Purves in 2001. Discovery Figure 2: Illustration of simultaneous contrast Chubb and his colleagues researched this illusion by showing various combinations of foreground objects and background fields to human test subjects and asking them to rate the sharpness of the visual contrast in each foreground object. They found that subjects viewing a patch of random visual texture embedded in a surrounding background field were likely to report different perceptions of visual contrast for the central target patch depending on the relative contrast of the background field. Furthermore, the apparent brightness/ dullness of a texture patch varied as the background varied. E.g. bright points of texture patch appeared duller in a high-contrast background, whereas dark points appeared lighter in an even background. This apparent variance in perception is influenced when it is viewed by different observers and when the background and central target patch are placed on ‚Äúnon- overlapping spatial frequency bands‚Äù, as explained by Chubb et al. This tendency was found statistically significant. Theories point to a perceptual tool to catalyse contrast adaptation (slow, seconds) to contrast gain control (fast,‚âà100ms) at an early cortical or pre-cortical ‚Äòneural locus‚Äô.  Chubb contrast effect  The Chubb illusion is similar to another visual illusion, the contrast effect. The contrast effect is an illusion in which the perceived brightness or luminance of an identical central visual target form on a larger uniform background varies to the test subject depending on the ratio of the central form's luminance to that of its background. This illusion, simultaneous contrast, is illustrated in Figure 2. In it, the central target is brighter. I.e., the ratio of the top central rectangle‚Äôs luminance (A) to its background field's luminance is greater than one. In the bottom rectangle (B), the background field is brighter. That is, the ratio is less than one. Although the two central target patches are equally bright (identical in luminance) the one on a dark background appears lighter and the one on a lighter background appears darker.  Lateral inhibition  Lateral inhibition is one proposal to explain the contrast illusion or simultaneous contrast. Its advocates theorize that neurons strongly stimulated by the background of B suppress the less strongly stimulated neurons of the interior rectangle. In A, they theorize, there is no such inhibition. However, the fact that both A and B appear of \\"uniform lightness across their expanse\\" suggests that the process of lateral inhibition is more complex. Chubb et al. assert that the principle of lateral inhibition rests on the assumption that the determining factor of perceived lightness is the ratio, at the rectangle edge, of rectangle luminance to background luminance. However, the lateral inhibition account is not consistent with phenomena such as the Benary cross and White's illusion as well as transparency and assimilation effects. As such, it is an ad hoc explanation of unclear theoretical interest. The Chubb illusion illustrates an error in contrast rather than luminance. The zero-luminance background of Figure 2 (A) becomes a zero-contrast field in the analogous portion of Figure 1, while the high-luminance field of Figure 2 (B) becomes a high-contrast texture field. Observers empirically perceive the texture disk of the leftmost portion of Figure 1 as having higher contrast than the disk on the right, even though the two are the same. After conducting experiments on contrast and lightness induction, interocular induction and induction between spatial frequency bands, they show that lateral inhibitory effect is monocular and adapted only for spatial frequency. Chubb et al. support \\"a model in which the output gain of such a band-selective neuron is normalized relative to the average response amplitude of nearby neurons with the same frequency tuning.\\" Imperfect transmittance  Figure 3: The Chubb Illusion Visual perceptions are dependent on the interaction of the human visual system with any bi-stable or multi-stable stimuli and the frequency of its occurrence. The lighting of objects at a point, the reflectance of those objects and the transmittance of media between the object and observer is central to determining the primary factors that affect our visual perception. It is due to this that a low contrast image is perceived to be of a higher contrast when placed in front of a grey background. The grey background is more ambiguous than the high contrast background. Lotto and Purves (2001) demonstrated that the Chubb illusion can be explained \\"by the degree to which imperfect transmittance is likely to have affected the light that reaches the eye.\\" Indeed, these observations suggest a wholly empirical explanation of the Chubb illusion. Chubb effect estimates that when an object is viewed through an imperfectly transmitting medium, it increases or decreases the apparent brightness or dullness of the target patch, even when luminance ratios and spatial frequencies remain the same. Lotto and Purves (2001) doubted that illusory perceptions of brightness were explained as consequences of lateral inhibition. If that were the case, the perceived difference in brightness of target elements, illustrated in Figure 3 (A), would be largely unaffected by the surrounding field in Figure 3 (C), which exhibits lower spatial contrast than the target, which matches the observations. Despite this, they asserted, \\"this reasoning is undermined by the fact that the apparent contrast by the target pattern in Figure 3 (D) is mostly unaffected by the surround of Figure 3 (F).\\" Therefore, they chose to examine the Chubb illusion in 'wholly empirical' terms, as mainly a consequence of past experience, or in this case, the influence of transmittance on ambiguous stimuli. The common denominator of the Lotto and Purves observations is the explanatory power of imperfect transmittance. Imperfect transmittance causes observers to experience a reduced difference in spectral contrast or luminance from object surfaces. This is because imperfections in the transmission medium produce, such as atmospheric effects distort transmittance. For instance, transmittance varies when viewing objects from a distance, in smog or fog, or through fabric, glass or water. These conditions greatly effect the amount of light that reaches the eye. This hypothesis was tested by altering the probable contributions of imperfect transmittance by manipulating motion, luminance and colour information. In some cases, the relative luminance of two target surfaces can be reduced, as Lotto and Purves demonstrate, from a ratio of 8:3 to approximately 7:5. If perception is generated empirically, then \\"the extent that a stimulus is consistent with imperfect transmittance...will be incorporated into the perception of the target.\\" Appropriate behavioural response depends on the evaluation of the relative contributions of illumination, reflectance and transmittance to the visual stimuli. Visual perceptions of contrast are affected by the effects of imperfect transmittance rather than the luminance of the object. The Chubb stimulus illustrated in Figure 1 (B) is consistent with transmittance distortions for two reasons: the patterned elements of the background are continuous with the patterned elements of the target and the luminances of the target elements accord with the values that would arise if the background pattern were viewed through an imperfectly transmitting medium. The transmittance explanation of the Chubb illusion asserts that changing the stimulus in Figure 1 (B) in a way that makes it less consistent with viewing through an imperfect medium should decrease, or reverse, the illusion. Trials confirm this hypothesis. This explanation throws into doubt the hypothesis that implies that altering luminance, motion, or spectral distribution of the field surrounding the target would not alter perception. The empirical findings also contradict the hypothesis that 'illusions of brightness' caused by contour junctions in the stimulus explain the Chubb illusion, as proposed by Anderson (1997).  Chubb illusions in predicting schizophrenia  Visual illusions can be categorised into physiological/pathological, perceptual and ambiguous (bistable/multistable). A deviation from the natural perception of objects (stimulus) encourages evaluation of the theories of perception. Visual perception in schizophrenia is distinguished by reduced contextual adjustments and a more accurate perception of the stimulus in tasks involving ‚Äòspatial contextual effects‚Äô. According to Eunice et al., ‚Äúcontextual illusions arise from vision‚Äôs adaptive propensity to emphasize relative differences among features rather than their absolute characteristics.‚Äù While the presence of a high-contrast background reduces the apparent contrast of smaller foreground features in healthy individuals, schizophrenic patients are more accurate in perceiving the contrast between the background and foreground. In order to test this, Keane et al. measured the performance of 15 participants with chronic schizophrenia, 13 psychiatric participants- including individuals with personality and bipolar disorders and 20 non-psychiatric healthy individuals. They were presented with a small isolated target patch or a small patch with a high contrast background, followed by a remote reference patch. The individuals were then asked to note which patch they thought was higher in contrast based on their observations. The schizophrenic group‚Äôs immunity to contrast illusion was exceptional, with 12 out of 15 accurate judgements while healthy participants showed severe misperceptions of the centre stimuli. This shows that individuals with schizophrenia are able to perceive ‚Äòabsolute characteristics‚Äô of ‚Äòindividual features‚Äô more accurately. While contextual modulations with regard to luminance, size and orientation were similar between groups, weak contextual modulations correlate with worse symptoms and social functioning. Visual defects in schizophrenia can lead to cognitive and social problems. Findings of enhanced performance help us ascertain the latent visual abnormalities. Indeed, there has been a rapid growth in the use of contextual visual tasks (Chubb illusions) in clinical testing and NIH- supported studies of schizophrenia. (Gold et al., 2012).  Old age  There is a reduction of the cortical inhibitory function within the ageing visual system, both in humans and animals. This reduction in inhibition accounts for a reduced orientation and direction tuning of aged visual neurons. L.R. Betts et al. (2005) demonstrated that older people were able to distinguish the motion of high-contrast stimuli quicker than younger adults, and that inhibition was responsible for differences in spatial suppression. Karas and McKendrick (2009) used the Chubb illusion to test whether high contrast backgrounds affected the visual perceptions of older participants lesser than the younger participants owing to reduced inhibition. The stimuli used for the experiments were based on the parameters used by Dakin, Carlin and Hemsley (2005), who used the Chubb illusion to check for reduced inhibition in schizophrenics. Their study however, showed that contrast sensitivity did not really decline with ageing as the older participants showed a greater discrepancy in perceived contrast of the target with regard to the background than the younger participants.

He writes a blog on the media site of The Guardian andd wrote a column for the London Evening Standard from 2006 to 2016. Early life and career He was educated at Dagenham County High School (1957‚Äì63) and, aged 17, was hired by the Barking and Dagenham Advertiser. After serving a three-year indentureship he joined the Lancashire Evening Telegraph in Blackburn as a sub-editor before spending 18 months as a sub- editor at the Manchester office of the Daily Mail. At The Sun and elsewhere In 1969, he entered Fleet Street as a news sub-editor on The Sun, which had just been acquired by Rupert Murdoch. He had a brief spell with the Daily Mirror in 1972 before returning to The Sun as deputy chief sub-editor, first with the news desk and later in the features department. He left The Sun in 1974 to write his first book and to take a degree in politics at the University of Sussex. He worked his way through university with part-time sub- editing jobs at the Brighton Argus, BBC Radio Brighton, the Sunday Mirror and Reveille. After graduating in 1979, he joined the Daily Star in Manchester for six months until being seconded to the Daily Express in London. He was soon appointed features editor of the Daily Star. In 1981 he returned to The Sun as assistant editor. He was involved in the move from Fleet Street to Wapping. Five years later, he transferred to The Sunday Times, first running the Review Section before becoming managing editor (news). In 1990, he was appointed by Robert Maxwell as editor of the Daily Mirror. While editor of the Daily Mirror, Greenslade was at the centre of a controversy after he rigged a competition in the paper to make sure it was unwinnable. He admitted his behaviour in October 2011 at a seminar at the Leveson Inquiry: ‚Ä≥On behalf of my proprietor Robert Maxwell I fixed a game offering a million pounds to anyone who could spot the ball and ensured that no-one won. Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea culpa.‚Ä≥ He departed in March 1991 and later that year was consultant editor for three months to both The Sunday Times and Today. The Guardian and other outlets From 1992 until 2005 he was media commentator for The Guardian. He presented BBC Radio 4's Mediumwave (1993‚Äì95) and in 1996 was the launch presenter of Britain Talks Back on Granada Talk TV. He has continued to be a regular broadcaster on media matters. After leaving The Guardian, he then spent three months with The Daily Telegraph in a similar capacity before returning to The Guardian to launch a media blog and began to write a weekly media column for the Evening Standard. His column for what is now the London Evening Standard lasted for ten years until April 2016, but he remains a contributor to the newspaper. In the context of a changing industry, Greenslade concluded his last column for the London Evening Standard with the observation: \\"Whatever happens, this I know: journalism, the trade I have practised for more than 50 years, must survive. Without it, democracy itself is imperilled\\". Other work He is on the board of the academic quarterly, the British Journalism Review, and is a trustee of the media ethics charity, MediaWise. In 2003, he was appointed Professor of Journalism at City University London in succession to Hugh Stephenson. Greenslade has been credited with coining the term: \\"The Hierarchy of Death\\" as well as writing extensively on the subject. He is also the author of three books, Goodbye to the Working Class (1976), Maxwell's Fall (1992) and Press Gang: How Newspapers Make Profits from Propaganda (2003).

His pseudonym was George King. This was exposed by Nick Davies, a Guardian colleague and instigator of the journalistic investigation into phone hacking. When Greenslade reviewed Davies's book on his blog in 2008, he did not deny his writings for An Phoblacht. Greenslade also spoke at a Sinn F√©in conference in London on the 30th anniversary of the hunger strikes, and he wrote an article on the same subject for An Phoblacht. He has had a house in County Donegal for many years, and a close personal friend is Pat Doherty, who from 1988 until 2009 was vice president of Sinn F√©in, and who has been publicly named as a former member of the IRA Army Council.

(2007). The aesthetics and moral politics of Fei Mu's Spring in a Small Town. Journal of Chinese Cinemas, 1(3), 171-187. It was produced and funded by Wenhua Film Company, whose great financial deficit at the time led Wenhua to produce Spring in a Small Town on a low budget, with a minimalist plot and setting which required only five characters.Daruvala (2007) The aesthetics and moral politics of Fei Mu's Springin aSmallTown, Journal of Chinese Cinemas, 1:3, 171-187. The original print of the film is now kept at the China Film Archive. Plot Taking place in a ruined family compound in a small town in the Jiangnan region after the Sino-Japanese War, the film tells the story of the once prosperous Dai family. The film opens with Yuwen (Wei Wei) walking alone along the ruins of the city wall, narrating the slow-paced circular nature of her life. The husband and patriarch, Liyan (Shi Yu) is ill, and wallowing in the miserable reality of his family's loss. Symptomatic of his illness and depression, his marriage to Yuwen has long been rendered loveless, though both remain dutiful spouses to one another. Liyan spends his days in the courtyard expressing nostalgia at a better time. Meanwhile, Liyan's young teenage sister Xiu (Zhang Hongmei), too young to remember the past, stays cheerful and playful in the ruins of their home. Lao Huang (Cui Chaoming) is an old servant of the Dai family who faithfully remains with the Dai family. The Dai family still manages to live in an unexciting peace, but this is challenged suddenly when an unexpected visitor comes to their home. An unexpected visit from Liyan's childhood friend Zhang Zhichen (Li Wei), a doctor from Shanghai who previously had a relationship with Yuwen before she married Liyan. As Zhichen walked through the ruined courtyard wall, it indicated that he walked into the heart of Yuwen, the marriage of Liyan and Yuwen and the life of them, which also creates a lively atmosphere to the ruined household. The rest of the film details the complicated relationship between Yuwen, Liyan, Zhichen and Xiu. Yuwen is conflicted between her love for Zhichen and her loyalty to her husband. In the first evening that Zhichen lived here, Yuwen visited him and sent him some bedding and a thermos to show her concern. That‚Äôs the beginning of their rekindling love. After the day, Liyan, Yuwen, Zhichen and Xiu hung out together. The scene of boating and eye contact between Zhichen and Yuwen already illustrated everything. Their emotional culmination happened when they two walked along the ruined city wall and tree-lined trail. However, their love was interrupted by a conversation between Liyan and Zhichen. Liyan loves his wife, but feels unworthy of her. Liyan thought that things would be better if Yuwen married with Zhichen. This made Zhichen feel guilty and he showed a trend of breaking up with Yuwen. The emotion conflict of Yuwen was most apparent in this scene: when Zhichen and Yuwen considered about how was everything going on next, Yuwen said ‚Äúwhat if he died‚Äù and then astonished by what she said, which completely shows the conflict between the loyalty to Liyan and the love to Zhichen. Xiu, having just turned sixteen years old, develops romantic feelings for Zhichen - who himself is conflicted between his love for Yuwen and his loyalty to his Liyan. As the film progresses, Liyan and Xiu begin to suspect that Zhichen and Yuwen are beginning to have strong feelings for one another. During a celebratory night, Zhichen, Liyan, Yuwen, and Xiu enjoy drinks and play games. Liyan begins to notice a happiness in Yuwen that he had not seen in some time, but that happiness is only manifested through her interaction with Zhichen. In a conversation with Yuwen shortly after, Liyan expresses his shame for being an inadequate husband, and he wishes out loud that Yuwen had married Zhichen instead. As Yuwen and Zhichen struggle between overcoming or succumbing to their passion for each other, Liyan attempts suicide by taking excessive amount of hypnotics, but he is resuscitated by Zhichen. After Liyan's attempted suicide, Yuwen begins to repair her relationship with Liyan. Both Yuwen and Zhichen express conviction not to rekindle their past relationship. As Zhichen departs, Huang and Xiu walk him to the train station. Zhichen makes a promise to return in a year. Yuwen, watching from the wall, is joined by Liyan as Zhichen departs. Background Spring In A Small Town takes place in the aftermath of the Second Sino-Japanese War. The Second Sino-Japanese War started in 1937 and ended in 1945, was a full-scale resistance by China to the expansion of Japanese influence in its territory. The Japanese bombed numerous Chinese cities, causing enormous casualties and damage, in which around 20 million people died.https://www.britannica.com/event/Second-Sino-Japanese-War The War also left the Nationalist Party in a precarious position, while the Communist Party gained more influence. The film was produced during the civil war. Fei Mu at this time finished the film in only three months, not using scripts for his actors and cutting the screenplay by two thirds. At the end of film, Fei Mu and screenwriter Li Tianjin did not use the screenplay that Zhichen and Yuwen joined revolution together‚Äîa kind of finale of a classic left-wing movie, since it is an easy solution. 1 Li, J.

Wei Wei, to prepare for her eventual iconic role, was told to underact her emotions. The Peking Opera actor Mei Lanfang was instructed to be her model.https://alphahistory.com/chineserevolution/sino-japanese-war/ The war between the Nationalists and the Communists is referenced ever so slightly in the film when Liyan scoffs at the notion that they are living in peaceful times despite the end of the Sino-Japanese conflict. Spring In A Small Town applied some analogies in ancient poetry to the scenes and images in the film, like moonlight, candle and orchid. Also, based on the Second Sino-Japanese War background and ruined walls image, the theme of Du Fu‚Äôs poem \\"Spring Prospect\\" was invoked in this film: The nation shattered, mountains and river remain. City in spring, grass and trees burgeoning. Feeling the times, blossoms draw tears. Hating separation, birds alarm the heart. Beacon fires three months in succession, a letter from home worth ten thousand in gold. White hairs, fewer for the scratching, soon too few to hold a hairpin up. The poem was written after An Lushan Rebellion in 757, which almost toppled the Tang Dynasty and is often seen as the beginning of Tang Dynasty‚Äôs long decline. It expresses Du Fu‚Äôs hatred of war and his sympathy for the people.Li, J. (2009). Home and Nation Amid the Rubble: Fei Mu's \\"Spring in a Small Town\\" and Jia Zhangke's \\"Still Life\\". Modern Chinese Literature and Culture, 21(2), 86-125. Theme This film represents the physical and psychological trauma for people and country after the war between China and Japan. Even though the Japanese forces surrendered, China was largely in ruins, having a large effect on its people in the post-war period. The city wall in the film is an important motif, as its dilapidated state reflects not only the physical destruction of the war, but also the general post-war depression of the people; the latter is personified by the male protagonist, Dai Liyan, who suffers from a psychosomatic illness as he struggles to cope with the destruction and decline of his estate following the War. The recurring scene of the broken city wall shown in the film reminds the audience about the destruction caused by the war.Carolyn FitzGerald, Spring in a Small Town: Gazing at Ruins, Chinese Film in Focus II, 2008, page 205-211 This film also explores Confucian values through the romantic struggles between characters, Yuwen and Zhichen. According to Susan Daruvala, the film acknowledges instincts and emotions as integral parts of a love relationship, yet they must be directed by wisdom or intelligence.Daruvala, S. (2007). The aesthetics and moral politics of Fei Mu's Spring in a Small Town. Journal of Chinese Cinemas, 1(3), 171-187. Despite the tempting passion in the relationship between Yuwen and Zhichen, it, ultimately, does not materialize, hence highlighting its unfeasibility within the framework of Confucian values: wisdom, intelligence, and loyalty. In addition, the ideology fa hu qing, zhi hu li (Âèë‰πéÊÉÖÊ≠¢‰πéÁ§º) appears in the film, it means \\"you may talk about love, but don't cross beyond the limits of etiquette.\\" Inoue and Choe state that this phrase plays a key part to \\"[rationalizing] the impasse of the situation\\" between Yuwen, Zhichen, and Liyan,Inoue, M., & Choe, S. (2019). Beyond Imperial Aesthetics: Theories of Art and Politics in East Asia. (1 ed.). Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press, HKU. muse.jhu.edu/book/67764. and summarizes the relationship between males and females in China during that time. The film could be regarded as a feminist film, considering Yuwen's voice-over narration is \\"unapologetic and frank in her description of her relationship with her husband.\\" Her blatant lack of guilt not only deviates from traditional norms at the time, but the film, which appears to favor her subjectivity, is also inconsistent with other films produced at the time. Lyricism in Spring in a Small Town Spring in a Small Town starts with a voice narration of the female protagonist, Yuwen. Her voice-over tells the tedious routines of her daily life. She describes the plot as it is shown to the audience, and she adds her personal feelings into her narration. Her voice-over lasts for about 18 minutes, until she and Zhichen physically meet in the film for the first time after their separation caused by the war. Yuwen‚Äôs narration is often regarded as highly artistic and unique by critics. Well-respected Hong Kong poet, Ping-kwan Leung, commented on the artistry and lyricism in the film. He argues that Yuwen‚Äôs voice is more than just simple narration, it is rather a lyrical film form which is characteristic of modern literary ideology. According to Leung, the voice-over is the key to establishing the film‚Äôs exceptional sense of lyricism as well as to Fei Mu‚Äôs personal interpretation of ruination and his poetic aesthetics. According to Jie Li, Yuwen‚Äôs voice- over accompanied by her personal subjective point of view shots connect the dreary city walls, her husband‚Äôs pessimism, and the ruins in the family compound. The amble cinematography in the film resonates with Du Fu‚Äôs famous poem ‚ÄúSpring Gazing‚Äù, which was written during the An Lushan Rebellion. The voice of Yuwen is the bridge that associates the dull, lifeless city ruins to the intimate household where the characters disclose their longing for passion and closure.

Reception from 1948 to recent time  Made after the war, Spring in a Small Town, unlike its leftist predecessors of the 1930s, focused on a more intimate affair with only tangential references to the politics of the day. Indeed, the film can be distinguished from those earlier works by its more mature treatment of inter-personal conflicts, particularly in the sense that there are no clear antagonists except for time and circumstance. Because of this apparent lack of \\"political\\" grounding, Spring in a Small Town was rejected by the Communist Party as rightist or reactionary, and was ignored following the Communist victory in China in 1949.Zhang Yingjin, \\"Introduction\\" in Cinema and Urban Culture in Shanghai, 1922‚Äì1943, ed. Yingjin Zhang (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1999), 8. This criticism was connected to socialist realist cultural policy introduced by the Soviet Union in the 1930s.Woodland, S. (2018).

In Dushu no. 12: 93-97 Li Liuyi, one of the mainland's leading theatre directors, together with actors from the Beijing People's Art Theatre and the China National Theatre, produced the world premiere of \\"Spring in a Small Town\\" on April 10, 2015. The play is adapted from the classic film in 1948 of the same name and same plot. Soundtrack ‚ÄúIn the Faraway Place‚Äù and \\"One Cute Rose\\" are folk songs created by Wang Loubin and song by Hongmei Zhang & Yu Shi. Sound recording is Miao Zhenyu and music is Huang Yijun.Modern Chinese Cultural Studies. ‚ÄúSpring In A Small Town‚Äù. Youtube Video, 1:33:17. April 10, 2020. The whole tone of the film is narrated from the female protagonist‚Äôs first point of view, her stream-of-consciousness voiceover showing her memory in the way of flashback. One critic called Yuwen an \\"unreliable narrator.\\" Another said it was an example of the inherent nature of a typical female voice. Still others saw it as Fei Mu's proto-feminist effort to restore voice to a traditionally silent gender or as an innovative way to subvert narrative.Inoue, M., & Choe, S. (2019). Beyond imperial aesthetics: theories of art and politics in East Asia. Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press, 117-118. The well-known author Ping-kwan Leung(Ye Si) suggests that Yuwen‚Äôs self-talk voice established the lyricism of the film. And he argues that the voice is lyrical rather than simply narrational: instead of describing what happened, it more focuses on the protagonist's inner emotional change and struggle.

The synagogue was established in 1872 by the Ruzhin Hasidim among the members of the Old Yishuv and was destroyed by the Jordanian Arab Legion on 21 May 1948 during the Battle for Jerusalem of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The synagogue was left as ruins after the recapture of the Old City in the Six-Day War. In November 2012 the Jerusalem municipality announced its approval for plans to rebuild the synagogue. The cornerstone was laid on May 27, 2014. Origins and name Acquisition Scroll, 1872 The synagogue was built in the 1860s by the followers of Rabbi Yisrael Friedman of Ruzhin and his son Rabbi Avrohom Yaakov of Sadigura, and was named \\"Tiferet Yisrael\\" after Reb Yisrael  tiferet means \\"glory\\" or \\"splendour\\" in Hebrew,Tehillim 89:17-19, Orthodox Jewish Bible (OJB), BibleGateway.com, accessed 30 July 2019 and Rabbi Yisrael was famous for conducting his court with a regal display of gold and wealth. Nevertheless, the strong involvement of Nissan Bak, led to the widespread use of the name \\"Nissan Bak synagogue\\". Another tradition, published by a relative of the Bak family, holds that it was named after Yisrael Bak (Nissan Bak's father), who had a decisive role in the construction of the synagogue. Although Hasidim had arrived in Jerusalem by 1747, it was only in 1839 that Nissan Bak began plans for a Hasidic synagogue. Until then they had prayed in small, private locations like Yisrael Bak's house. In 1843 Nissan Bak traveled from Jerusalem to visit the Ruzhiner Rebbe in Sadigura. He informed him that Czar Nikolai I intended to buy a plot of land near the Western Wall with the intention of building a church and monastery there. The Ruzhiner Rebbe, who was very involved in assisting the yishuv, gave Bak the task to thwart the Czar's attempt. Bak managed to buy the land from its Arab owners for an exorbitant sum mere days before the Czar ordered the Russian counsul in Jerusalem to make the purchase for him. The Czar was forced to buy a different plot of land for a church, which is known today as the Russian Compound. When Rabbi Friedman died in 1851, his son, Rabbi Avrohom Yaakov Friedman, the first Rebbe of Sadigura, continued the task of raising the necessary funds for the project. Construction Preparing for prayer, c.1940 Nisan Bak was the architect and contractor of the project.Brayer, The House of Rizhin, p. 261. Initially the Ottoman authorities refused to grant permission to dig the foundations, and when permission was eventually granted, the crew discovered a Muslim sheik's grave on the site. Eventually the Muslim religious judge agreed for the tomb to be moved outside the city walls. After the foundations had been dug, another setback cropped up. It became apparent that it was necessary to obtain a building permit from the officials in Turkey who were not keen to grant the request. Bak, an Austrian national, convinced Franz Joseph I of Austria to intercede, and in 1858 a firman was granted. Over ten years were spent raising funds as the building slowly took shape. Official stamp, 1872 There is a legend, proven by researcher Tamar Hayardeni to be non-factual and to have emerged a good 30 years after the end of the synagogue's construction, that in November 1869 Franz Joseph, en route to the inauguration of the Suez Canal, made a visit to Jerusalem. Included in his itinerary was a tour of the Jewish institutions of the city. When he toured the Old City with Bak and others, he asked why the synagogue was standing without a roof. Bak quipped, \\"Why, the synagogue took off its hat in honour of Your Majesty!\\" The Kaiser smiled and replied, \\"I hope the roof will be built soon\\", and left the Austrian counsel with 1,000 French francs for the dome's construction. From then on, the dome was referred to by locals as \\"Franz Joseph's cap\\".Brayer, The House of Rizhin, p. 262. The three- story synagogue was inaugurated on 19 August 1872, 29 years after the land had been purchased. For the next 75 years, it served as the centre for the Hasidic community in the city. It was considered one of the most beautiful synagogues of Jerusalem, with a commanding view of the Temple Mount, ornate decorations, and beautiful silver objects donated by Hasidim.Brayer, The House of Rizhin, p. 263. Destruction The synagogue in a state of advanced destruction, missing its dome and suffering a large gaping hole to one of its exterior walls, May 1948 During the Israel War of Independence, the Tiferet Yisrael Synagogue was used as a post by the Haganah in the defense of the Old City. During the Jordanian Legion's campaign to capture the Old City, it blew up the synagogue an hour after midnight on the night of May 20‚Äì21, 1948. Modern-day ruin and reconstruction plans Following the Six-Day War, the decision was made to leave the ruins of the synagogue as they were. Only its western wall remains. In 2010, at the dedication of the reconstructed Hurva Synagogue, also destroyed in 1948, plans were announced by the same donors who sponsored the Hurva rebuilding, to rebuild the Tiferet Yisrael Synagogue as well. In November 2012, the Jerusalem municipality approved a plan to rebuild the synagogue. Funding would come from an anonymous donor. In 2014, the synagogue is being rebuilt. Tiferes Yisroel yeshiva and synagogue Tiferes Yisroel yeshiva (left) and synagogue (right) in West Jerusalem (New City) In 1953 Rabbi Mordechai Shlomo Friedman, the Boyaner Rebbe of New York, laid foundations for a new Ruzhiner Torah centre in the New City of Jerusalem to replace the destroyed Ruzhiner synagogue. In 1957 the Ruzhiner yeshiva, called Mesivta Tiferes Yisroel, was inaugurated with the support of all of the Rebbes of the Ruzhiner dynasty.Brayer, The House of Ruzhin, p. 459. A large synagogue was built adjacent to it, also bearing the name Tiferes Yisroel; the current Boyaner Rebbe, Rabbi Nachum Dov Brayer, leads his Hasidut from here. The design of the synagogue, located on the western end of Malkhei Yisrael Street close to the Central Bus Station, includes a large white dome, reminiscent of the domed Tiferet Yisrael Synagogue that was destroyed in the Old City.

The seventh tropical cyclone and third named storm of the annual hurricane season, Chris developed from a tropical wave while roughly midway between Africa and the Lesser Antilles on August 21\\\\. Forming as a tropical depression, it remained weak for several days, crossing the Lesser Antilles, Hispaniola, and The Bahamas during this time. While offshore the coast of Florida on August 28, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Chris. Thereafter, the system tracked rapidly north- northwestward and came ashore near Savannah, Georgia later that day. Once inland, Chris quickly weakened, and by early on the following day, it weakened to a tropical depression over South Carolina. Six hours later, Chris was absorbed by a cold front while over North Carolina, though the remnants of the system tracked across the Eastern United States and Atlantic Canada before dissipating on August 30\\\\. In the Leeward Islands and U.S. Virgin Islands, Chris produced only light rainfall, that caused no damage or fatalities. Heavy rainfall occurred in Puerto Rico, which damaged 100 homes and caused three fatalities. Large amounts of precipitation also fell in Hispaniola, though no damage was reported. In the United States, much of the damage occurred due to tornadoes, especially in The Carolinas. A tornado in South Carolina destroyed at least 15 mobile homes, caused one fatality, and resulted in a brief shutdown of U.S. Route 301. Flooding was minimal, as rainfall totals amounted to or less, though standing water was reported on Interstate 26. Another destructive tornado occurred in Virginia. Two additional deaths were reported in New York, two from drowning and one from a tree falling onto a car. Although winds were light, at least 118,000 people from South Carolina to Maine were left without electricity. The dissipating storm produced light winds and precipitation in Nova Scotia. Overall, Tropical Storm Chris was attributed to four fatalities and $2.25 million (1988 USD) in losses. The Storm's track is similar to Hurricane David in 1979 Meteorological history A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on August 15\\\\. Six days later, the system developed into Tropical Depression Seven while centered halfway between the Lesser Antilles and Africa. The depression tracked west-northwestward around the periphery of a subtropical surface high pressure ridge. After strengthening minimally, the depression struck Guadeloupe late on August 23 and entered the Caribbean Sea shortly thereafter. Although satellite intensity estimates indicated tropical storm status, 13 reconnaissance flights conducted by the National Hurricane Center between August 23 and August 27 indicated winds were less than 40 mph (65 km/h). By August 25, the depression made landfall near Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Despite the mountainous terrain of Hispaniola, the depression did not weaken and re-emerged into the Atlantic from the northern coast of Haiti early on August 26\\\\. The depression curved northwestward and did not strengthen. On August 27, the depression made another landfall near Andros Town on Andros, Bahamas. Later that day, the depression passed less than east of West Palm Beach, Florida. Thereafter, the depression curved north-northwestward and remained offshore of Florida. At 0600 UTC on August 28, a ship located about from the center of the depression reported tropical storm force winds. As a result, the depression was finally upgraded to Tropical Storm Chris. Tracking rapidly north-northeastward, Chris attained its peak intensity about six hours later, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . The storm made its final landfall near Savannah, Georgia with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) at 1500 UTC on August 28\\\\. After moving inland, Chris quickly weakened and was downgraded to a tropical depression near Columbia, South Carolina on August 29\\\\. Shortly thereafter, Chris merged with a cold front over North Carolina. The remnants of Chris tracked east-northeastward across the Eastern United States. Eventually, the remnants briefly re-emerged into the Atlantic from New England, then moved across Nova Scotia before dissipating near Cape Breton on August 30. Preparations In preparation of the tropical depression, officials in Puerto Rico closed public schools and sent federal workers home early. At 1000 UTC on August 28, a tropical storm watch was issued for Edisto Beach, South Carolina, to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Two hours later, areas from Savannah, Georgia, to Cape Hatteras North Carolina, were placed under a tropical storm warning. They were later discontinued at an unknown time. Residents of Charleston, South Carolina, complained of little warning in advance of the storm. However, as Chris moved ashore only nine hours after becoming a tropical storm, there was minimal time for preparations. Impact Rainfall totals in Puerto Rico. Lesser and Greater Antilles In the United States Virgin Islands, the depression dropped 1 inch (25 mm) of rain. Precipitation on the island of Puerto Rico was generally between , with a peak total of 14.5 inches (356 mm) in Hacienda Constanza. Heavy rainfall resulting in flooding, which damaged at least 100 homes and left 485 people homeless. By August 24, at least 15 people evacuated their homes because of flooding. Due to high winds, two cars were crushed by falling trees, causing the deaths of two men and one 12-year-old boy. Hispaniola received heavy rain and 35 mph (56 km/h) winds but no deaths or damage was reported. In the Bahamas, the storm brought winds of 35 mph (56 km/h) but left no damage. United States Rainfall totals from Tropical Storm Chris. The outer bands of Chris produced of rain in Florida, though no damage was reported. At Fort Pulaski National Monument in Georgia, tides were above normal. In that state, Chris produced a sustained wind speed of 43 mph (69 km/h) at Savannah Light, though it was at an elevation of . In addition, the highest wind gust was reported at that location, reaching up to 49 mph (80 km/h). Elsewhere in Georgia, winds were light and were below tropical storm force. Rainfall in the state was mostly less than , with a peak of in southeastern Georgia. Along the coast of South Carolina, tides of at least and above normal were reported at Charleston and Myrtle Beach, respectively. However, the Preliminary Report on Tropical Storm Chris indicates tides of at Charleston and above normal at Myrtle Beach. Several tornadoes were spawned in the state, one of which caused one fatality, one injury, and destroyed at least 15 mobile homes in Clarendon County. Overall, tornadoes in the state collectively resulted in more than $550,000 in damage (1988 USD). Debris littered U.S. Route 301, which briefly shutdown that highway. Winds were relatively light in the state, with sustained winds generally less than and gusts to were reported in Charleston. However, 18,000 people in Charleston and other nearby communities lost electricity. In addition, one mobile home was destroyed and another was overturned in Olanta. Rainfall in South Carolina was generally between , though peaking at in Bishopville. Near Columbia, of rain fell in only an hour, leaving standing water on several roads, including Interstate 26. In North Carolina, a tornado spawned in Iredell County threw a tractor-trailer into a building at an industrial park. The tornado also struck the Iredell Container Corp. building and damaged several nearby mobile homes. As a result, numerous residents of Iredell County were left without gas or electricity. Four houses and a produce stand were destroyed by another tornado along U.S. Route 401 in Cumberland County. A third tornado in Granville County caused one injury and light damage. Collectively, the three tornadoes in the state caused at least $1 million (1988 USD) in damage. In Charlotte, a wind gust of was reported, which downed power lines and damaged the facade of a hotel. In Mecklenburg County, Virginia, an F2 tornado spawned near Chase City damaged or destroyed ten buildings, including a mobile home, which was wrapped completely around a tree. Additionally, several vehicles were damaged and one injury occurred. Damage from that tornado reached about $700,000 (1988 USD). Winds in Washington D.C. reached slightly more than , leaving 3,800 homes without electricity. In Maryland, rainfall was less than at all locations. A wind gust reaching was reported in Baltimore, though sustained winds were below tropical storm force. Similar amounts of rainfall occurred in other nearby states such as Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania; minor creek flooding occurred in those three states. In Wilmington, Delaware, a wind gust of was reported. Power lines were snapped in Essex County, New Jersey. The storm downed power lines on Staten Island and Long Island in New York, leaving 31,000 people without power. However, many had their electricity restored within 24 hours. A woman was killed in Mamaroneck when an oak tree fell on her car. According to New York City Transit officials, trees also fell on tracks, which slowed transportation services during rush hour. Two other fatalities when two people canoed in the Highland Falls Reservoir; high winds tipped their canoe and both people subsequently drowned. Wind gusts up to in Rhode Island caused scattered power outages and minor property damage, due to falling tree limbs. In Connecticut, gusty winds felled trees, which struck power lines, leaving at least 59,000 people without electricity. High winds in Maine from the storm damaged power lines, leaving 10,000 people without electricity. The storm also damaged four houses and several automobiles near Crystal Lake. Throughout the United States, damaged totaled to at least $2.25 million (1988 USD). Canada The extratropical remnants of Chris dropped heavy rains and produced winds of 25-30 mph (40‚Äì48 km/h).

Originally built as a monastic grange of the Cistercian order over 900 years ago, it is situated just outside the town of Porthcawl, near Bridgend. Little remains of the original structure and it was completely rebuilt in the late sixteenth century. Its residential form appears to have been determined by the preceding monastic grange. The house was made famous as the basis of R. D. Blackmore's book The Maid of Sker. History Sker House was constructed about 900 years ago as the grange of Neath Abbey. There would have been a farm with outbuildings and barns, accommodation for the Cistercian monks who worked there and a chapel. Not much of the medieval house remains but one of the buildings may be preserved as part of the nearby large barn, Ty yr Ychen, which is also medieval. In 1543, after the dissolution of the monasteries, the property was purchased by Richard Williams, and soon afterwards repurchased by Christopher Turberville. The original house had a single storey but in the late sixteenth century, under the ownership of Jenkin Turberville, substantial rebuilding took place, probably retaining the layout of the original building. The house now became a gaunt grey three-storey building with attics. The east wing had two large, symmetrically arranged turrets, where the main doors were and through which all the storeys could be accessed. The west wing had several more randomly-placed turrets and towers, one of which housed a staircase to all floors. The great hall occupied the central part of the house on the first floor, and extended upwards into the second floor. There was a parlour on one side of this and living accommodation on the other, while the ground floor housed the kitchens, offices and servants quarters. Modern times After the Turbervilles left the property, it was held by absentee landlords and let to a series of tenants and its condition declined. It belonged to the Margam Estate until 1941. After many years of abandonment, the south wing eventually collapsed. Beginning on 31 March 1999, the building underwent a significant restoration. The project ended in July 2003. The house's troubled history continued when the contractors for the restoration ran into massive overspending and went into receivership at the end of 1999. In 2003, the house was sold to Niall Ferguson. It now stands whitewashed in yellow against the backdrop of the barren sands of Kenfig Burrows and the sea. It is a Grade I listed building. Legend Two ghosts are said to haunt Sker House: the captain of a ship that wrecked on nearby Sker Point, and Elizabeth Williams. Williams' father locked her in a room of the house to prevent her from running off with her lover. Legend has it she died in that room of a broken heart. Sker House was made famous through a novel written by R.D. Blackmore, The Maid of Sker, published in 1872.

Early life and career until 1630  May was born in Mayfield, Sussex, the son of Sir Thomas May, a minor courtier. He matriculated at Sidney Sussex, Cambridge, graduating B.A. in 1613. He wrote his first published poem while at Cambridge, an untitled three-stanza contribution to the University's memorial collection of poems on the death of Henry Prince of Wales in 1612.Epicedium Cantabrigiense in obitum immaturum & semper deflendum, Henrici ... (Cambridge: 1612), p.103 Although the majority of this volume's poems are in Latin, May's (along with a few others) is in English. It uses the trope of Pythagorean transmigration, which he re-employs in later works. Acquaintance with Carew, Massinger and Jonson In 1615 May registered as a lawyer at Gray's Inn in London. There is no record of what he did for the next five years. During the 1620s May was associated with dramatic circles. In 1620 his romantic comedy, The Heir, was performed by the Players of the Revels. Although this company usually performed at the rowdy, open-air Red Bull Theatre, May's play was first performed privately (according to its only published edition), and is tonally ill-suited to a plebeian city audience. During the early 1620s May befriended the courtier, poet and diplomat Thomas Carew, who contributed a poem to the published text of The Heir in 1622, and probably also Philip Massinger. Massinger wrote at least one play for the short-lived Revels company (The Virgin Martyr, with Thomas Dekker) and shared May's generally Roman interests. In 1629 May wrote a commendatory poem for Massinger's The Roman Actor, describing him as his 'very deserving friend'. May knew Ben Jonson personally by the late 1620s, if not earlier. In 1625 May was responsible for the verse translations in Kingsmill Long's translation of William Barclay's Arcadian political allegory. Bellum Civile translation May's career-defining work was his translation of the Latin poet Lucan's Bellum Civile. Lucan's is a narrative of the downfall of the Roman republic in the civil wars between Pompey and Julius Caesar: it laments the loss of republican liberty and institutions and condemns Caesar's immoral ambition. The first three books of May's translation appeared in 1626 and the full ten a year later (with different printers); it was reprinted in 1631, 1635 and 1650, each time with minor corrections. The 1627 edition boasted dedications of Books II to IX to prominent English noblemen, many of whom were actual or suspected opponents of Charles I's ongoing attempts to tax without Parliament. The overall work was dedicated to William, 2nd Earl of Devonshire. May compares the fortitude and patriotism of these aristocrats to the patrician heroes of Lucan's doomed republic. These dedications disappear from later editions and there is some evidence they were defaced or removed, possibly by censors. In June 1627 May composed a poem celebrating Charles I as absolute ruler of the seas, probably as part of the upswell of support for the Isle de Rh√© expedition. It re-uses the Pythagorean trope May first employed in his poem of 1612. Other works and translations 1626 also saw the performance of May's tragedy Cleopatra, although it isn't known where or by whom; it was printed later in 1639. A manuscript version in the British Library, of uncertain date, contains a number of small but interesting textual variants. During the next few years he wrote two further classical tragedies, Antigone (published 1631) and Julia Agrippina (1639); the first was probably never staged but the second claims a 1628 performance on its title page. May's tragedies are modelled on Jonson and are also plausibly influenced by Massinger; they concentrate on political themes, rather than erotic passions; Cleopatra and Antigone draw linguistically and thematically on Lucan. During the later 1620s May also published two further translations of Latin poetry: Virgil's Georgics (1628) and a selection from the Epigrams of Martial (1629). The latter hints at biographical content, highlighting Martial's poverty and his decision to abandon a legal career for poetry. Neither work was republished.  May in the 1630s  Until 1630 May seems to have lacked much reward or recognition for his literary efforts. None of the dedicatees to his early works, including the eight titled nobles addressed in his 1627 translation of Lucan, can be connected to his later activities. In dedicating his Georgics May even turned to a fellow alumnus of his old college, Sir Christopher Gardiner, a well-known Catholic philanderer who left shortly afterwards for the New World ‚Äì hardly the best prospective patron. Continuation May's fortunes probably improved towards the end of the decade. In 1630 a seven-book Continuation of Lucan appeared, in which May took the narrative up to Caesar's assassination in March 44 BC; it was republished in 1633 and 1650. This work may have led to May developing an appetite for historical poetry. He wrote works on Henry II and Edward III during the next five years, each also in seven-book form. All three works were aimed at and seemingly well received at court: they were dedicated to Charles I, probably with the king's encouragement. It was later claimed that May was paid for these efforts. A story also survives of Charles intervening to prevent May being struck by a nobleman at a court entertainment. That said, May did not find regular employment at court and, with the exception of Carew, doesn't seem to have been acquainted with the band of amorous, courtly Cavalier poets. This may have been in part due to a lack of shared interests: unlike the Cavaliers, May had no obvious interest in love poetry (no examples by him survive) or indeed erotic themes in general. If he wrote any significant court entertainments, they have perished. May and Ben Jonson May did have acquaintances. After the Restoration the then Earl of Clarendon, Edward Hyde, recorded that before the Civil War he and May had belonged to a close-knit circle of lawyers and writers grouped around the heavyweight figure of Ben Jonson. This group seems to have been closer and more serious than the 'tribe of Ben', a group of writers who simply styled themselves on Jonson without necessarily knowing him well. According to Hyde, the grouping also contained Carew, John Selden, the lawyer John Vaughan (who was later one of Selden's executors), Charles Cotton and the courtier Sir Kenelme Digby. There is some difficulty in identifying exactly when this circle was in operation, but it probably began during the 1620s: both Vaughan and Jonson wrote dedicatory poems to May's translation of Lucan, and as we have seen Carew was friendly with May by 1622. Together with Jonson (and probably because of him) May became intimate with Sir Kenelme Digby, later Jonson's literary executor and sponsor of his 1640 Folio Works. Jonson and May were the first two poets in a manuscript collection of poems commemorating the unfortunate death of Digby's wife, Venetia, in 1633. Their shared poetic concerns also surface in a short treatise written by Digby on Edmund Spenser (Elizabethan author of The Faerie Queene), apparently at May's request. This work talks of Jonson as Spenser's literary heir. May complimented Digby for his Spenserian criticism in an effusive sonnet, and later dedicated the published version of Cleopatra to him. Jonson died in 1637 and the following year May contributed an elegy to the memorial collection Jonsonius Virbius: it began by comparing Jonson to Lucan. During the 1640s a story arose that May had expected to be given Jonson's royal pension, and became disaffected when it passed instead to William Davenant. This story was designed to paint May as an ingrate, and reflects less what he did or thought at the time than his later activities as a writer for the Parliamentary cause. A comedy of May's, The Old Couple, later published in 1658, claims to have been performed in 1636.  The 1640s: May and Parliament  In 1640 May published a Latin adaptation and translation of his Continuation of Lucan, the Supplementum Lucani. Befitting a major work of neo-Latin poetry it was published in Leiden, one of the centres of continental humanist scholarship, and received dedications from a number of Dutch intellectuals including Marcus Zuerius van Boxhorn and Nicolaus Heinsius. Letters from Heinsius's father Daniel to Patrick Young, the Royal Librarian, and John Selden indicate that May wrote the translation while in the Netherlands (on what business is unclear). It retained the Continuation's dedication to Charles I, although it has plausibly been argued that it expresses greater hostility to Caesar and monarchy than the original. Parliamentarian views During the early 1640s ‚Äì it is unclear when ‚Äì May gravitated towards support for Parliament. In 1642, he wrote a tract supporting brief but regular meetings between King and Parliament, probably to agitate for the Triennial Act, which was much republished. It contained harsh criticism of princes (like Charles I) who had sought to rule without consulting Parliament, but also warned against allowing the people too much responsibility, equating popular government with damaging innovation and turbulence. May emerges in this work, his only explicit statement of political analysis or belief, as a cautious and conservative thinker, distrustful of awarding too much power to any one body, and therefore implicitly a constitutionalist Parliamentarian. This stance was shared by other members of the former Jonson circle, such as Hyde or Vaughan, until late 1642: both had participated in early reforms such as the Bill of attainder of Strafford before switching sides (Hyde) or retiring to his Welsh estates (Vaughan). Another ex-Jonsonian, John Selden, remained a moderate and respected Parliamentarian until his death in the early 1650s. History of the Parliament and the Breviarium Partly as a result of his early pamphleteering, May was commissioned by the House of Commons to compose a History of the Parliament, which appeared in 1647 in Folio. A shining example of rhetorical humanist historiography, complete with plentiful classical citations (especially from Lucan), May presented recent English history as the wrecking of a peaceful and prosperous Elizabethan polity by the greed and stupidity of the Stuarts. In October 1649, following the regicide and the emergence of an English republican government, May contributed a dedicatory epistle to Charles Sydenham's attack on the Leveller John Lilburne, addressing the members of the Rump Parliament, Roman style, as 'Senators'. May's epistle counsels against legislating for greater freedom of conscience, arguing that it is alienating the regime from potential allies such as the Presbyterians. He dismisses Lilburne and fellow democratic agitators for having no landed interest in the kingdom (echoing the position taken up by Ireton in the Putney Debates of 1647) and warns MPs to heed the 'better sort'. The regicide and subsequent events are hailed as miracles of God. In 1650 May published a revised history of Parliament eschewing (for the most part) classical citations and other rhetorical adornments in favour of a curt, Sallustian Latin prose style. First published in Latin in April 1650, the Breviarium was swiftly rendered into English, presumably by May himself, as the Breviarie; it appeared in June 1650. In November 1650 May died. Royalist propaganda later held he had suffocated on the strings of his sleeping bonnet after a heavy drinking binge, but there is no particular reason to believe this: he was already fifty-five. The republicans Henry Marten and Thomas Chaloner were charged by the Council of State with seeing to May's 'burial', setting aside ¬£100 for the purpose, and both men and Sir James Harrington with finding a replacement historian of Parliament. May was interred in Westminster Abbey, his epitaph (supposedly written by the journalist Marchamont Needham) saluting him as the 'defender of the English commonwealth [Vindex Reip. Anglicae]'. In later writings Nedham claims to have known May as a friend. After the Restoration his remains were exhumed and buried in a pit in the yard of St Margaret's, Westminster. May's change of side made him many bitter enemies, and he is the object of scathing condemnation from many of his contemporaries.

Ed Vulliamy of The Guardian was also with the ITN teams. Their subsequent reports shown throughout the world, generated an international outcry. However, a witness for the defence at a subsequent war crimes trial in the Hague accused the team of faking their footage. The false accusations were reprinted in the British LM magazine (formerly Living Marxism) in an article by Thomas Deichmann and ITN sued. In March 2000 ITN won their case against the magazine in a High Court libel action. An examination of the case by a professor of cultural and political geography at Durham University argued that the key claims made by the magazine were \\"erroneous and flawed\\".

Later the games were spread to other places including Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh in India as well as, Sri Lanka and Malaysia. Variants are called as Ali guli mane (in Kannada), Vamana guntalu (in Telugu), and Kuzhipara (in Malayalam). The game is played by two players, with a wooden board that has fourteen pits in all (hence the name from the words fourteen pits (pathinaalam kuzhi). There have been several variations in the layout of the pits, one among them being seven pits on each player's side. The pits contain cowry shells, seeds or small pebbles used as counters. There are several variations of the game depending on the number of shells each player starts with. Gameplay Overview Girls playing Pallanguzhi Pallankuzhi is played on a rectangular board with 2 rows and 7 columns. There are a total of 14 cups (kuzhi in Tamil language) and 146 counters. For the counters in the game, seeds, shells, small stones are all common for use. As the game proceeds, each player distributes the shells over all the pits. The players may capture the shells, as permitted by the rules of the game. The rules of capture depend on the variant of the game played. The game ends when one of the players captures all the shells, and is declared as a winner. 12 counters are placed in each cup except the middle of each row into which only 2 counters are placed. The starting player lifts the counters from any of his holes and, going counter-clockwise, distributes one counter in each hole. If he reaches the end of his cups he goes on his opponent's side of the board. When the player drops his last counter, he takes the counter from the next cup and continues placing them in this way. If the last counter falls into a cup with an empty cup beyond, the counters in the cup beyond the empty hole are captured by the player and put into his store. That player then continues play from the next cup containing counters. If the last counter falls into a cup with two empty holes beyond, he captures no counters and his turn is over. The next player continues play in the same way, taking counters from any of his cups and going around placing counters in a counter-clockwise direction. If, after having a counter dropped into it, a cup contains 6 counters, those become the property of the player who dropped the counter (called Pasu in Tamil language) . The round is over when no counters remain. Once the first round is over players take the counters from their stores and fill as many of their holes as possible with counters. The winner will have a surplus of counters which are kept in his store. The loser of the first round will be unable to fill all of his holes. These unfilled holes are marked as \\"rubbish holes.\\" In the next round play continues as before, but without the rubbish holes being included and the player who went first in the previous round going second. During the game if a player has enough counters to fill any of his rubbish holes back up their status is removed and they are again used during play. The game is over when a player is unable to fill any cups with six counters at the end of a round. Objects Tamarind seeds and cowry shells (Sozhi (‡Æö‡Øã‡Æ¥‡Æø) in Tamil language) are used in this game, to fill the holes of the Alli gulli board. Popularity This game is popular among the kids and old people. This game is encouraged for the kids to learn to count, to improve eye‚Äìhand coordination and concentration while playing. And for the older people of the house, to spend time in the company of the young members of the family. Pallanguzhi is also played in Sri Lanka, Trinidad, Guyana and Singapore, with a sizable Tamil-Indian population living in those countries.

Story The world is hidden in fog, and is ruled by the goddess of Light, Mikage, from the Fuyo Palace, in which she protects the Pillars of the Sun. Ayaka, daughter of the goddess of Darkness, Reiki, who has been sealed by Mikage, attacks the Fuyo Palace at the head of her eleven Mouryou to destroy the Pillars of the Sun and revive her mother, but she meets Kai, son of Mikage, and instantly falls in love with him. When Kai, who doesn't know who the girl is, speaks about her and says she's a monster, she flees crying, and he follows her to the kingdom of Reiki, only to discover that the enemy kingdom is being protected by his mother Mikage. Characters ; Ayaka : At the beginning she thinks to be the daughter of Reiki and a monster, but in truth she's the goddess of the Moon and twin sister of Mikage, who assassinated her, sealed her body in the Underworld and hid her soul; Kai's father found her soul and put it in the body of a newborn baby, child of a Mouryou and a woman. : Her love for Kai is not, as she thinks, love at first sight, because she met the prince when they were children, but Mikage erased their memory. ; Kai : Son of the previous king and the goddess of Light Mikage, he's been told that his father has been killed by Reiki and fights to prevent her resurrection. In truth, his mother is the one who killed him, and when he realizes it he uses his power to destroy the Pillars of the Sun with his white flute. ; Mikage : Goddess of Light, was born as the goddess of the Sun; because of Rajin's prediction that one of the twin sisters would become a monster she was separated from her sister Ayaka, as everyone thought that obviously the goddess of the Moon would have been the monster, and while Mikage became the Queen, Ayaka was imprisoned. When she found out that the man she loved, Kai's father, was in love with Ayaka, she killed Ayaka out of jealousy, and then, when she discovered that Kai's father had saved her soul, killed him too. After that she hid the world in a dense fog, and shut her eyes, so that no one could find hints of her guilt. ; Reiki : Initially thought to be Ayaka's mother, and the goddess of Darkness; when the Pillars of the Sun are destroyed, and the goddess of the Darkness is supposed to become the new Queen of the world, instead she's taken to the Underworld and the fog suddenly vanishes. It's later revealed that she's only a manifestation of Mikage's hatred, and exhorts Ayaka to come to her to have a chance of eating her soul. ; Kai's father : He first appears in the story as a man with a death mask, saving Ayaka more than once. However, though his identity is revealed only at the end, he is the one that gave Ayako the chance to be reborn as the Mouryou princess, and the only one (apart from Rajin) who knows the full truth, but he's now only a ghost. ; Kurama : Leader of the Oni-Tengu, he is a skilled fighter and a womanizer, and he too is in love with Ayaka.

Its subtitle is –≥–µ—Ä–º–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –¥–µ—Ç–µ–∫—Ç–∏–≤ (\\"hermetic detective\\"). Akunin conceived of the Fandorin series as a summary of all the genres of detective fiction, with each novel representing a different genre. Leviathan is his nod to Agatha Christie's style, with an exotic setting, a cast of unusual characters who each have secrets of their own, and a strange murder to start the action. Plot summary The novel is set in 1878. The story opens with the murder in Paris of Lord Littleby, all seven of his servants and two children of servants. All were poisoned except for Littleby, who was bludgeoned with an ancient Indian artifact, a golden statuette of Shiva, which belonged to Lord Littleby and was stolen from his room, along with an old Indian shawl. French detective Gustave Gauche, in charge of the investigation, boards the passenger ship Leviathan. Gauche knows that the murderer must be one of the first-class passengers, because one of the special golden badges for the ship's first-class passengers was left in Littleby's room. Among the suspects are a Japanese Army officer, an addled English aristocrat, a married Swiss woman, and a clever young Russian diplomat on his way to his new post in Japan. The diplomat is Erast Fandorin, the master detective, who shoots down each of the ineffectual Gauche's incorrect conclusions, and in the end takes it on himself to find the murderer. Awards and nominations *Leviathan was nominated for Best European Crime Novel in the Gumshoe Awards 2005.Gumshoe Awards 2005 BBC Radio Adaptation The novel was adapted for the BBC's Saturday Play.

In Present day, Pavagadh is a Municipality operated region in Panchmahal district about away from Vadodara in Gujarat state in western India. It is known for a famous Mahakali temple which draws thousands of pilgrims every day. It is a tribal area populated predominantly by the Rathwas. The area of this locality Champaner- Pavagadh Archaeological Park was inscribed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 2004.Champaner-Pavagadh Archaeological Park History It is said that the Rajput king Vanraj Chavda established Champaner at the foot of Pavagadh in fond memory of his wise minister Champa. Later, the Patai Raval family ruled it and took care of the boundary. The folk tales say that Mahakali assumed the form of a woman and danced in a Garba during Navaratri. The last Patai, Jaisinh watched her with dirty looks. The deity became angry at Jaisinh and cursed him that the town will fall. The Muslim emperor of Gujarat, Mahmud Begada assaulted Pavagadh and won the hill on the boundary in the 15th century. Patai was defeated and killed. Mahmud Begada shifted his capital from Ahmedabad to Champaner for some time for reasons of diplomacy. He developed the town by constructing buildings such as the fort of Champaner, Uohra mosque, Mandavi, Kirtistambh, the temple of Shalkh, Jama Masjid, Nagina Mosque, and Kevda Mosque. The remains of the Palace of Begada are still found near Vad Talav (Banyan Pond) two kilometers (1.25 miles) away from Champaner by road. The government has granted many concessions and offered subsidies to the new industries coming up in this area. As a result of it, Halol and Kalol towns near Pavagadh have turned into virtual industrial estates. A film studio at Halol has this added advantage. Geography Pavagadh Hill's Footsteps Pavagadh is the gateway to Panchmahal. The locations of hilly areas around Halol provide good scenery. Pavagadh Hill has total height of 822 meters and you can find many scenic trails to climb including waterfalls during monsoon time. On the hill's eastern side, the Rangpur Ashram run by Mr. Hari Parikh works towards the upliftment of the local tribals. The plateau at an altitude of 490 meters is known as Machi Haveli. The bus service has been extended up to Machi. Notable people The great music maestro of 16th century, and Tansen's contemporary rival, Baiju Bawra belonged to Champaner. Places of interest *Pavagadh Jain Temple:Pavagadh Jain templeThe temples of Jainism at Pavagadh are noteworthy. They fall into three different groups: The first consists of the Bhavanaderi temples near the Naqqarkhana gate called the Navalakka temples, the second group is in honor of the Tirthankaras Suparshvanatha and Chandraprabhu and the third group, situated on the southeast of Pavagadh Hill (Mataji's cliff), is near the PƒÅr≈õva temple next to the Dudhia tank. On the basis of their \\"stylistic and architectural features\\", the date of construction of these temples is deduced to be the 14th-15th centuries. The temple is made up of pure white stone with elaborately carved seated and standing images of the Jain pantheon are seen on the outer walls of the temples. * Kalikamata Temple, a famous Hindu pilgrim centre, is located at Pavagadh. Situated amid dense forest cover on a cliff, the temple is believed to be one of the 51 Shakti Peeths. Maa Mahakalika Udan Khotala (A Passenger Ropeway) is operating since 1986 and takes you quickly and comfortably from Manchi to the hilltop near the Maha Kalika Temple in about 6 minutes, whereas, the steep climb on foot takes over one hour. The temple of Kali is at the height of 550 metres (1,523 feet). A rope-way facility has been made available (commissioned in 1986) to the tourists to reach the temple. About 250 steps have to be climbed from there. * The remains of the Raval Palace still exist at Machi. There are rest houses, holiday homes and small hotels at Machi. * Then comes Teliya Talav and Dudhia Talav. *There are numerous tales, songs and dramas knitting the story of Patai Raval.

Fry was born in Bourbon County, Kentucky to John Fry and Mary Fry. Mary moved with her son and new husband Benjamin Wells to Rushville, Missouri around 1857. Fry, who weighed less than 120 pounds, was assigned to the first leg of the westbound route of the Pony Express delivering it from the stables in St. Joseph, Missouri a few blocks to a ferry across the Missouri River before carrying it on to Seneca, Kansas. Ads for the Pony Express said, \\"Wiry young men, preferably orphans to ride 20 miles...\\" While there are no photographs of the start of the Pony Express, the old tin-type of Johnny Fry standing next to Johnson William Richardson in a sailor's hat and jacket, with Charlie Cliff and his brother Gus Cliff pictures the riders hired by Lewis for Russell, Majors, and Waddell. The start of the Pony Express was delayed two hours to 7:15 p.m. because the courier from the East Coast had missed a train connection. Fry was the scheduled official first rider on April 3, 1860. Years later, a W. B. Richardson (1851‚Äì1946) claimed to be the Pony Express rider denied the honor, in an article titled \\"Uncle Billy Richardson, 91 Today, Disclaims Fame.\\" W. B., who would have been about nine or ten years old the day of the historic ride, boasts that his half-brother Paul Coburn, who was the station manager, \\"accidentally\\" threw the \\"mail pouch\\" on his pony instead of Fry's horse and so he made the ride.Johnson William Richardson biography at xhomestation.com Supposedly, Richardson rode the first blocks from the stables to the river, where the pouch was handed to Fry, who rode the ferry to Elwood, Kansas and then took it on to Seneca, Kansas. Fry was to deliver the first eastbound mail back to St. Joseph. W. B. Richardson's recollection contradicts all historical accounts. Clearly, as the accompanying picture shows, J. W. Richardson, the actual rider, was not W. B. Richardson, a nine- or ten-year-old boy, but a grown man when he was hired by Lewis for Russell, Majors, and Waddell. He rode for the company until the Transcontinental Telegraph went into service. According to his relatives, he rode on to Fort Laramie and died later that year. Local lore says that the donut was invented as a cake for Fry to eat, passed to him by young ladies, as he rode past their homes.Frequently Asked Questions at Xhomesation.com After the Pony Express went out of business in October 1861, due to the advent of the transcontinental telegraph, Fry joined the Union Army and was killed by Quantrill's Raiders in the Battle of Baxter Springs.

Prior to that, and despite the existence of a chapel, it was part of a larger Argivai parish, that still exists as a separate although diminished parish in the city. Geography The area of the parish of P√≥voa de Varzim is today practically totally urbanized and completely transformed by man. The former P√≥voa Bay (Enseada da P√≥voa), is the modern Port of P√≥voa de Varzim, former small rivers existed in the city, as some excavations near the Casino suggest. Pra√ßa do Almada, the civic center square, was the location of the Bo√≠do Lagoon in P√≥voa Bay. In the Northern high-rise district, another lagoon existed until the 20th century. Historically, the city was formed by three urban quarters: Bairro da Matriz (14th century), Bairro Sul (17th century) and Bairro Norte (19th century), these are still the most important and the most beloved neighbourhoods by the population, as living in their area is not a requirement to one being considered part of it. Over time, other neighbourhoods started to be created. These and others areas had been inhabited from much earlier. Its Atlantic waters were very popular for talassoterapy until the mid-20th century, due to large amounts of algae and iodine. City districts The parish of P√≥voa de Varzim contains nine of the eleven city districts: *Agro-Velho (south part) *Bairro Norte *Centro *Bairro Sul *Parque da Cidade (a very small part of it, known as Montgeron after the sister French town) *Barreiros *Giesteira (part) *G√¢ndara (west part) *Bairro da Matriz/Bairro da Mariadeira Former civil parishes of P√≥voa de Varzim ","title":"P√≥voa de Varzim Parish"},{"id":"6455883","text":"Diana Athill (21 December 1917 ‚Äì 23 January 2019) was a British literary editor, novelist and memoirist who worked with some of the greatest writers of the 20th century at the London-based publishing company Andre Deutsch Ltd.Athill, Diana (5 January 2008), \\"'Getting things right': Recalling her life as one of the 20th century's most acclaimed editors, Diana Athill, who has just turned 90, was a pioneer of the confessional memoir.

It was hastily formed out of the emerging Air Mobile Brigade of the Royal Netherlands Armed Forces between February 1994 and November 1995 to participate in peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslavia. It was tasked to execute United Nations Security Council Resolution 819 in the Bosniak Muslim enclaves and the designated UN \\"safe zone\\" of Srebrenica during the Bosnian War. In July 1995 as the Bosnian Serb forces, under Colonel General Ratko Mladiƒá, came to take over the enclave, Dutchbat was vastly outnumbered and were far too lightly equipped to repel the more heavily armed Bosnian Serb troops. It also had its request for air support to the UNPROFOR denied. Subsequently, the Serbian forces, under Mladiƒá's command, led Srebrenica's Bosniak male inhabitants into the mountains, where thousands of them were massacred. Despite their efforts to secure peace in the area the enclave fell into Serbian hands. In 2016, several veterans of the battalion, with approval of its commander, sued the Dutch government for \\"severe negligence and carelessness\\" regarding the mission.Dutchbatters klagen de Staat aan om Srebrenica (Dutch) Operation DUTCHBAT was a Dutch army battalion.‚ÄúThe Netherlands placed a battalion of the Airborne Brigade at the disposal of UNPROFOR.

Its mission consisted of deploying four successive rotations, each of around 450 persons, named \\"Dutchbat I, -II, -III and -IV\\". The Dutch troops were armed with personal weapons, machine guns and two anti-tank RPGs, in accordance with the UN mandate of UNPROFOR. The headquarters were installed in an old battery factory in Potoƒçari, 5 km from Srebrenica. DUTCHBAT used 30 observation posts (OPs) throughout the perimeter of the enclave,\\"The Netherlands placed a battalion of the Airborne Brigade at the disposal of UNPROFOR.

UNPROFOR's mission was to execute United Nations Security Council Resolution 819 in the Bosniak Muslim enclave (dubbed a \\"secure area\\" or \\"safe haven\\" by the UN). The Rules of Engagement (ROE) stated that the peacekeepers could use force for self-defence only. They relied on air support from NATO. Intervening in the fighting was forbidden to all NATO and UN troops. In accordance to resolution 819 phrase 10; Resolution 819 demanded that all parties ensure the safety of the Protection Force, United Nations personnel and other international organisations. The Netherlands placed a battalion of the Airborne Brigade at the disposal of UNPROFOR. The main force of the battalion (‚Ä¶ Dutchbat) was stationed in the Sebrenica enclave.‚Äù Judgement of the Supreme Court of the Netherlands, 6 September 2013, First Chamber, 12/03324 LZ/TT (official English translation). DUTCHBAT's zone fell under siege by the VRS when NATO air forces began bombing the Bosnian Serbs besieging Sarajevo. Events Former Dutchbat area in Srebrenica/Potoƒçari, pictured in 2008 Described by some analysts as \\"a mousehole\\" because of its geographic location in a valley enclosed by hills and mountains, the Srebrenica enclave was easily blockaded by the Bosnian Serb forces of Colonel General Ratko Mladiƒá, isolating the Dutch battalion, causing serious deficiencies in provisions. When VRS (Army of Republika Srpska) artillery squashed the resistance of the ARBiH (Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina) 28¬™ Mountain Infantry Division that was defending the town, Lieutenant-Colonel Karremans made an urgent request for air support from the United Nations for two Dutch F-16s to attack the heavy armour of the VRS. The attack never took place. It was cancelled when Serb forces threatened to execute 50 members of Dutchbat III who had been seized as hostages. On 8 July, a Dutch YPR-765 armored vehicle took fire from the Serbs and withdrew. A group of Bosniaks demanded that the armored vehicle stay to defend them, and established a makeshift barricade to prevent its retreat. As the armored vehicle continued to withdraw, a Bosniak farmer who was manning the barricade threw a hand grenade onto it and subsequently killed Dutch soldier Raviv van Renssen. During the third 'rotation', \\"Dutchbat III,\\" commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Karremans, Mladiƒá's soldiers took the town on 11 July 1995, causing the displacement of many of the city's inhabitants. About 15,000 displaced persons undertook the flight towards Tuzla on foot, but the majority looked for protection from the UN blue helmets in Potoƒçari. Mladiƒá met with Lt. Col. Karremans and there it was agreed that the enclaves would be handed over to the VRS. Under the pretext of evacuating the Bosniak population to a sheltered city, most of the women and children were transferred by bus to a zone under Bosnian Serb control. The Serbs assured Karremans that the men would be transferred later. But instead, the Serbs proceeded to massacre Srebrenica's male population of approximately 2,400 Bosniak men of different ages. On the 21 July, with the entire zone already under the control of the VRS, the Dutch battalion left the enclave. From July until November 1995 Dutchbat IV served and mainly dealt with refugees at Simin Han, near Tuzla. Consequences Dutchbat III veterans marching in The Hague on Veterans' Day, 2014 This incident had great impact on public opinion in the Netherlands. An official seven-year investigation of the incident by the Netherlands Institute for War Documentation resulted in the report Srebrenica: a ‚Äòsafe‚Äô area, published April 10, 2002, which resulted in the resignation of Prime Minister Wim Kok six days later.Dutch cabinet resigns over Srebrenica massacre The 3,400-page report criticized the political and military High Commands of the Netherlands as being guilty of criminal negligence, for not preventing the massacre. The conclusions were devastating: *The mission was not suitably prepared. * There was no coordination between the Ministry of Defence (under Joris Voorhoeve) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (under Hans van Mierlo). * The contingent did not receive sufficient means to accomplish the mission. Adequate firepower and Forward Air Controllers (FACS) to direct air attacks were missing. * The non-Dutch in charge of air support refused to give aid as requested by Karremans. * The Netherlands and the UN did not perform their duty. On December 4, 2006, Minister of Defence Henk Kamp gave a remembrance insignia to the soldiers of Dutchbat III, draaginsigne DBIII. This award was severely criticized by the public as well as by some survivors and relatives of Srebrenica victims. In June 2007 an association of relatives of the victims of the massacre presented a denunciation in The Hague against the Government of the Netherlands and the UN for its negligence in the massacre. In October of the same year, twelve former members of DUTCHBAT III visited the Memorial for the Srebrenica massacre, paying tribute to the victims. The same group of relatives opposed their act of atonement to open dialogue. According to testimonies of 171 of the members of the battalion, 65% left the Army, 40% of these requested psychological treatment, and 10% show symptoms of post- traumatic stress disorder (official figure; health professionals treating these people deem the number much higher).

The Clan MacDonald of Keppoch has a chief that is recognized by the Lord Lyon King of Arms and the Court of the Lord Lyon. History Origins of the clan The MacDonalds of Keppoch are descended from Alistair Carrach MacDonald who was a younger son of Good John of Islay, Lord of the Isles, 6th chief of Clan Donald and his second wife Margaret Stewart, daughter of King Robert II of Scotland.The Family Tree of the Lords of the Isles finlaggan.com. Retrieved 13 October 2013. John of Islay, Lord of the Isles, apportioned his estates between the children of his two marriages in accordance with the marriage settlement of his father-in-law Robert II of Scotland and the Lordship of Lochaber was given to Alistair Carrach MacDonald who was the third and youngest son from his second marriage. Alistair Carrach MacDonald was the first MacDonald of Keppoch and Garragach. 15th century and clan conflicts Alistair Carrach MacDonald of Keppoch took an active part in supporting his brother, Domhnall of Islay, Lord of the Isles, in claiming the Earldom of Ross. The result was that upon the death of Domhnall, Lord of the Isles in 1425 the Lordship of Lochaber was forfeited to the Crown and then the Crown bestowed it on the natural son of Stewart, Earl of Mar. This grant was later cancelled but the Lordship of Lochaber did not revert to Alistair Carrach MacDonald but instead was given to the Lord of the Isles who subsequently granted the lands of Lochaber to the chief of Clan Mackintosh and this was confirmed by the Crown. However, the superiority remained with the Lord of the Isles who did restore it to Alistair Carrach MacDonald of Keppoch. However, this arrangement was never confirmed by the Crown and upon the forfeiture of the Lord of the Isles in 1493, Angus MacDonald, 2nd of Keppoch had to maintain his position in Lochaber by force. It was defended for two and a half centuries and it was not until the downfall of the clan immediately after the Battle of Culloden in 1746 that Mackintosh become the real Lord of Lochaber. From The Highland clans of Scotland; their history and traditions (1923) by R.R. McIan. This illustration is titled \\"MacDonald of Keppoch\\". In 1497 or 1498 the Clan MacDonald of Keppoch defeated the Clan Stewart of Appin and the Clan MacLaren at the Battle of Black Mount in which both the chiefs of Appin and Keppoch were killed. 17th century Alexander MacDonald, 12th of Keppoch, along with his brother was slain in 1663 in what is known as the Keppoch murders. The heads of the seven murderers were washed at Tobair-nan-ceann (Scottish Gaelic for the \\"Well of Heads\\"), before presentation to the Lord MacDonell of Invergarry. In 1668, the MacDonalds of Keppoch fought at the Battle of Mulroy where they defeated the Clan Mackintosh.. In 1689, the MacDonalds of Keppoch laid siege to the town of Inverness. Noted in the Black-book of Taymouth that in 1681 a bond of manrent was given by Gilleasba, chief of Keppoch, to John Glas, first Earl of Breadalbane; \\"such as Ceppoch's predecessors gave to the Earl's predecessors.\\" binding Keppoch \\"to restrain all the inhabitants of Brae-Lochaber, and all of the name of Macdonell, from committing robberies within the Earl's bounds.\\" 18th century and Jacobite risings During the Jacobite rising of 1715 the Clan MacDonald of Keppoch were indirectly involved in the Siege of Inverness (1715). General Wade's report on the Highlands in 1724, estimated the clan strength at 220 men. During the Jacobite rising of 1745, the clan chief, Alexander Macdonald, 17th of Keppoch, was among the men who attacked British Government soldiers who were preparing a surprise assault on the Glenfinnan gathering at what is now known as the Highbridge Skirmish. This was the first strike on the government during the 1745 rising. The MacDonalds of Keppoch were also involved in the Siege of Fort William in March 1746. Alexander, 17th Chief of Keppoch, later died at the Battle of Culloden in 1746. Alexander was succeeded by his son, Ranald, the 18th Chief, followed by his son, Richard (19th Chief). The chiefship would become dormant in 1848 with the death of Chichester, the 21st Chief. The next chief wasn't acknowledged until 13 September 2006 when Ranald Alasdair MacDonald of Keppoch was acknowledged as the lawful chief by the Lyon Court, following a 30-year fight for the right to use the ancient title of Mac Mhic Raonuill. His descent from Donald Gorm, younger brother of Archibald 15th Chief (c. 1680) was accepted by the Court.Macdonald of Keppoch Petitioner (No. 2) 1994 SLT (Lyon Ct) 2; Macdonald of Keppoch v Lord Advocate 2004 S.C. 483 (Court of Session decision on appeal) http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/search- judgments/judgment?id=25a487a6-8980-69d2-b500-ff0000d74aa7 (accessed 11/04/2018)  20th century  John de Lotbini√®re MacDonald (c. 1857 - 1935), paternal grandson of John MacDonald of Garth was the 22nd clan chief. Maternally, his grandfather was Robert Unwin Harwood, and Michel-Eustache- Gaspard-Alain Chartier de Lotbini√®re was his great-grandfather. Clan Castle Keppoch House which replaced Keppoch Castle The seat of the chief of the Clan MacDonald of Keppoch was originally at Keppoch Castle which was near to Spean Bridge in Lochaber. In 1690 it passed to the Mackintoshes. The lands were then disputed with the Mackintoshes, with the last clan battle being fought here. The castle itself had been demolished in 1663 after the Keppoch murders.

The organisation moved from being primarily a grant giving organisation into being a development agency that is working through the Church of England's Diocesan network to offer support to local communities through the Together Network. Timeline *1985 ‚ÄòFaith in the City‚Äô report produced, highlighting the social turmoil existing in many of England's cities. *1987 The Church Urban Fund launched by the Church of England as a response to ‚ÄòFaith in the City‚Äô with the aim of supporting local projects tackling poverty in England's poorest communities. It was envisaged that CUF would have a 20-year life span. *1988 A national campaign launched to raise ¬£18 million from Church members. *1990 ¬£3.2 million was awarded to projects in England's inner cities and outer housing estates during the year. *1991 Over ¬£18 million had been raised by the national campaign since 1987. *1996 By the end of 1996, the Fund had awarded over ¬£25 million to over 1,180 projects. *1998 The Church Urban Fund celebrated its 10th anniversary. Two thousand people from CUF supported projects attended a day of music, seminars and prayer in Coventry Cathedral. *1998 CUF's Development Programme was established to work with partners outside the Church and to build practical and strategic alliances within church structures at all levels. *2000 and 2002 Debates at Synod affirmed the Church's commitment to ministry alongside the poor and marginalised. *2003-2004 Extensive consultation at various levels across the dioceses with the Urban Bishop's Panel, Synod members, the public and voluntary sectors, to assess the need for continuing CUF and how the organisation should change to be more effective within its contemporary context. *2005 Debate at Synod commended the Church Urban Fund and backed its continuation. In 2005 CUF had invested more than ¬£55 million in over 4,400 local faith based projects in the poorest areas of England. *2006 The Fundraising Campaign due in 2006 to allow CUF to continue to allocate over ¬£3 million each year to projects addressing the needs of disadvantaged communities across England *2011 Near Neighbours programme starts work through CUF that brings together people in diverse communities. It is a partnership between CUF and the Archbishops' Council, funded by the Department for Communities and Local Government *2012-2015 Church Urban Fund goes under a period of restructuring that sees the organisation move from being primarily a grants fund to being a development agency that is working in local areas to strengthen communities. *2016 Church Urban Fund adopts a new look with bright orange, red, and yellow colours dominating the way CUF looks. This reflects the new style of work CUF adopted between 2012 and 2015 *2016 CUF takes on the work of the Just Finance Foundation after the successful trial period set up by the Archbishop of Canterbury References Church of England missionary work ","title":"Church Urban Fund"},{"id":"6456022","text":"The name Wukong has been used to name four tropical cyclones in the northwestern Pacific Ocean.

The species was first described by William John Swainson in 1821.  Distribution  It lives in eastern North America.  Biology  Adults fly in May and June in the north, but have several generations in the south. Larvae feed on grapes (Vitis), Parthenocissus quinquefolia and Ampelopsis (Wagner 2005).  Description  The underwings have a strong yellow band and in flight, the moth buzzes, appearing like a bee. The forewings are violet grey when fresh and have a \\"barklike pattern of swirling black lines\\" according to David Beadle and Seabrooke Leckie. At rest, they raise their abdomens and are well camouflaged on tree bark, looking like a broken branch (Wagner 2005). Early instars are a pale greenish white, with at first a horn, but later a brown knob near the hind end. Final instars (75 mm in length) come in two patterns: one has brown bands such that there are ten large pale green spots on the back and an eyespot on the rear. This form may mimic grapes. Others are completely brown, with a wood-grain patterning, and with the rear eyespot (Wagner 2005). In the final instar the knob looks a lot like a vertebrate eye, down to the white reflection spot. If it is pinched or poked, the larva squeaks and bites at the attacker (Wagner 2005).

The population of the village numbering 1,830 people (2002 census) and most of its inhabitants are ethnic Hungarians. Villagers are mostly preoccupied with farming. It is widely known as a Christian pilgrimage site.  Location  Doroslovo is located between Sombor and Novi Sad, 15 km from Sombor, 60 km from Novi Sad and 45 km from Osijek in Croatia, across the Danube bridge. Ethnic groups (2002 census) Church of Mother of God Helper of Christians near Doroslovo. Ethnic groups in the village include: * 952 (52.02%) Hungarians * 659 (36.01%) Serbs * 84 (4.59%) Croats * 39 (2.13%) Yugoslavs * 39 (2.13%) Romani * Others.  History The miracle fountain shrine of Bajkut (–ë–∞—ò–∫—É—Ç, Bajk√∫t), now called Sentkut (–°–µ–Ω—Ç–∫—É—Ç, Szentk√∫t - holy well) is located close to the village of Doroslovo. It has been known since the Middle Ages when the area belonged to the Kingdom of Hungary. Doroslovo probably was the location of a monastery founded in the 12th century and a church built in memory of the martyr St. L√µrinc, which is now ruined and forgotten. The first documents of Bajkut (Bajk√∫t) as a parish are from 1382 and the existence of a fountain with miraculous powers was mentioned already then. The settlement became the property of the nuns and remained so for a very long time until the Ottoman conquest in the 16th century. During the Ottoman rule (16th-17th century), Doroslovo is mentioned as a place populated by ethnic Serbs. Since the end of the 17th century it was part of the Habsburg Monarchy and since 1918 part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and subsequent [Yugoslavian] states. Historical population *1961: 2,669 *1971: 2,339 *1981: 2,131 *1991: 1,864 *2002: 1,830  Holy water  According to the legend, The Holy Mother has appeared at the fountain Sentkut (Szentk√∫t) on several occasions and it is believed that she asked God to give healing power to the water of the well. Many miraculous events have been linked with Sentkut (Szentk√∫t). In 1792, a 40-year-old blind man, Janos Zabloczky was told by The Holy Mother in a dream, to go to Doroslovo and wash his eyes in the Sentkut (Szentk√∫t) water and he gained his sight back. The priests of Doroslovo have since then noted many healings at the shrine. Many believers, including the blind and crippled are visiting the shrine, hoping for blessing, recovery and peace of mind and the number of pilgrims have greatly increased.  Church  The first chapel in honour of The Holy Mother was built in 1796. A new one replaced it in 1809 but was destroyed by fire after 50 years. A third chapel was made of bricks in 1825 and rebuilt and enlarged into the present church with the addition of two towers in 1875. A sculpture of Virgin Mary was erected close by the well in 1861 and a Lourdes cave shrine with a statue of St. Mary was consecrated in 1910. A building with a long outside corridor, to be used for confessions was built in 1909 and the whole area was turned into a nice park with trees and bushes. The outside of the church was renovated in 1942 but the coloured glass windows were demolished during World War II. The inside of the church was renovated in 1967. An open-air altar attached to the outside of the church was consecrated in 1974 and fresco paintings by Lajos Horvath were made behind the open-air altar, on the walls of the confessional corridor and on the outside of the nearby caretaker's house. In 2009 the open-air altar was reconstructed and enlarged, the Holy Mary sculpture was moved closer to the church and the area between the sculpture and the church reconstructed and provided with new benches. The following years the church underwent a much needed renovation and extension with a new chapel on the northern side of the church. In 2012 the caretaker's house and the adjacent house for visiting priests were demolished. Unfortunately, all the fresco paintings of the open-air altar and the demolished house were removed in the process. A new house has been built to replace the demolished buildings.  Pilgrimage site  Today, Doroslovo offering a beautiful place for pilgrimage and attracts Christians from all the neighbouring countries. Due to its long history and beautiful location, Doroslovo offers ideal conditions for peaceful contemplation and prayers encouraging believers to come back often. At the holy days of special celebration, the Doroslovo shrine is visited by large numbers of pilgrims and is known to provide a powerful religious experience.

Life Francis Asbury Baker was born in Baltimore, Maryland on March 30, 1820, the son Samuel Baker, a prominent physician and University of Maryland Professor of Medicine. Dr. Baker was a great admirer of Francis Asbury, a popular Methodist bishop at that time, and named his son after his friend. Francis Baker graduated from Princeton University in 1839, and was ordained an Episcopal priest in 1846. He was assigned at first as an assistant at St. Paul's Episcopal Church, Baltimore, and six years later was named rector of St. Luke's Church in the same city, where he became known as an eloquent preacher.Smith, Michael Paul. \\"Francis Asbury Baker.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 31 Jul. 2015 Baker had great respect for the ideals held by John Henry Newman. His encounters with then Redemptorist Father Augustine Hewit and Archbishop Francis Patrick Kenrick of Baltimore as well as the intellectual ferment fostered by the Oxford Movement persuaded Baker to become Catholic in 1853, a conversion that created considerable stir at the time. He then changed his name to Francis Aloysius, in honor of Francis de Sales and St. Aloysius.Hewit, Augustine Francis. Life of the Rev. Francis A. Baker, The Catholic publication house, 1869 He was ordained a Redemptorist Priest three years later. The Redemptorists presented week-long missions so that regular parish members and especially the poor could receive the religious instructions given by these traveling preachers. Father Baker worked closely with Father Isaac Hecker on his missions and so after Hecker‚Äôs expulsion from the Redemptorists and subsequent permission to found the Missionary Society of St. Paul the Apostle, granted by Pope Pius IX, Baker joined fellow missionaries Isaac Hecker, Augustine Hewit, Clarence Walworth, and George Deshon in leaving the Redemptorists to found the new society. Father Baker divided his time as a Paulist between assisting at St. Paul the Apostle parish in New York City and giving missions throughout the eastern states. Baker was a zealous and effective missionary. The strain of both tasks took its toll on Baker‚Äôs fragile health and as early as 1861 he was forced to slow his activities because of throat ailments. In early 1865 Baker contracted typhoid fever from his work with New York‚Äôs poor and due in part to his already fragile health. He soon after died quietly surrounded by family and friends at the age of 45 just seven years after the founding of the Paulists. He is buried at Old St. Patrick‚Äôs Cathedral in New York.

Manta produced the Manta Mirage, and later produced other component kit cars, including the rear-engined Volkswagen Beetle-based Manta Montage, and the mid-engined Montage-T, which had a custom space frame chassis and used GM X-body V6 drivetrains. The Montage-T recreated the elusive McLaren M6GT. A very accurate reproduction of the classic 1953 Corvette was to be added to their product line, and although a prototype was built, Manta Cars ceased production in 1986, having sold about 1,000 factory-built and component cars. Manta Mirage The Manta Mirage was an American mid-engined vehicle produced by Manta Cars. The Mirage, originally referred to as just the \\"Manta\\", or the \\"Manta Can-Am\\", was a lightweight, road-legal racing car. The Mirage's steel space frame chassis was fitted with a high-output V8 engine and four-speed transaxle. Most Mirages were equipped with or Chevrolet small-block V8 engines, and several vehicles were fitted with V8s sourced from Chevrolet, as well as V8 engines sourced from Ford. The original Mirage design mated the Chevy V8 to a Corvair transaxle via a Kelmark adapter and remote shifter. The bodywork was all hand-laid fiberglass, colored in a range of gel-coat colors. Gull-wing doors were fitted to a removable top section, while the doors flip forward for entry.

It originally opened in 1995 under the name Top Gun until it was renamed in 2008 to Flight Deck, after Paramount Parks sold Wonderland to Cedar Fair which necessitated the gradual removal of all Paramount names and trademarks from the theme park. History The roller coaster is based on the 1986 film Top Gun (produced by Paramount Pictures, a sister company of Paramount Parks), and the ride is meant to simulate the feeling of riding in an F-14 fighter jet. The ride is themed heavily after the movie with various props alongside the line-up including models of the F-14 aircraft, hangars, radar installations, army trucks and informational posters about the making of the movie. Since its early inception, the ride was known as the flagship ride in the park, finally losing that distinction to Behemoth in 2008. When Vekoma announced the 689m Standard Suspended Looping Coaster, Paramount had cancelled their plans with Bolliger & Mabillard (B&M;) to make an inverted coaster to go on the land where Behemoth currently stands on due to Cedar Point's contract on having no B&M; inverted coaster in the radius of a Cedar Fair park. Because Canada's Wonderland was situated from Cedar Point, the custom inverted coaster was cancelled and the SLC was put in place. The ride was built where \\"Zumba Flume\\" (a water log ride) was once located. The \\"Top Gun\\" movie theme was a shift in the design of the park. The ride no longer was themed to match the \\"land\\" in which it was situated. The ride was renamed Flight Deck in 2008, following the park's sale to Cedar Fair. The ride has had many breakdowns which include seats and chain lift failure. There have been a couple of accounts where the train has been stuck on the lift hill with people on the ride. The ride has been classified by many as a very rough ride. Criticism by fans has been aimed at current Wonderland owner Cedar Fair for not updating the ride's trains as the ride still runs its trains from 1995. Characteristics Station RCAF hangar. The station of Flight Deck is one of the most themed stations in the park with the station of Time Warp coming close after it. Flight Deck's station is shaped like a hangar for airplanes. The line up for the ride is under the hangar as the line up curves back-and-forth between the two sides of the hangar. The trains for Flight Deck wait under the hangar too. Around the hangar are many military objects that are themed to the movie Top Gun. Some of these objects include trucks, airplanes, and radar. The colours of Flight Deck match in with the theme of Top Gun. The supports of the track are coloured grey and the track itself is coloured with a much lighter shade of grey. The trains on Flight Deck are coloured mainly red, but also have a bit of white on the backs of the seats. The station for Flight Deck is coloured all grey. Rider requirements Riders may not carry loose items during the ride. Riders are encouraged to remove glasses and hats due to the high velocity of the ride. Onlookers will notice many guests riding in their bare feet as flip flops and sandals can come off very easily. Ride mechanics Flight Deck features a number of roller coaster elements including a sea serpent roll (two inversions), a sidewinder loop, and a double inline twist. First, the trains of Flight Deck go up to the top of the lift hill which is almost tall. Then, the trains go down the hill which does a 90 degree turn to the right on the way down, speeding at 80 km/h. At the bottom of the first drop, the passenger's feet are just a couple of feet away from the ground. The ride has many near miss effects with the ground, track and supports. After that, the roller coaster's train goes through a half loop, an inline roll and then another half loop, followed by an overbanking turn and a sidewinder loop. Next, Flight Deck's trains go through a 180 degree turn and through two barrel rolls. Lastly, the trains make another 180 turn and head into the final brake run. Trains The trains to Flight Deck are inverted, with the passenger's feet able to hang freely. The trains to Flight Deck are inverted, meaning that the passengers' feet hang free with no floor under them. Flight Deck has two trains working all the time. Each of the two trains has ten cars, and each of the cars can hold two people. Therefore, each train can hold 20 passengers at a time and 40 passengers can ride Flight Deck at a time. The cars of Flight Deck's trains have a shoulder harness which is attached to the bottom of the seat with seatbelts. The trains were originally named Maverick and Iceman, going along with the callsigns of the two pilots in the Top Gun film. For the 2010 season, the trains were renamed Firehawk and Raptor. In popular culture A scene from the TV show Flashpoint was filmed on the evacuation stairs of Flight Deck during the 2008-2009 offseason. The episode aired on April 10, 2009 and is titled \\"The Perfect Family\\".

Description  Lycaste flowers, like all orchid blooms, have three petals and three sepals. The petals are typically yellow, white, or orange, and the sepals are yellow, orange, green, or reddish brown. The petals and sepals may be marked sparsely or densely with red, reddish purple, purple, or reddish brown spots. The lip (ventral petal) may be very similar to the other two petals, as in Lycaste aromatica or Lycaste brevispatha, or colored quite distinctively, as in several subspecies and varieties of Lycaste macrophylla. Most Lycaste flowers are medium in size, averaging about 5 to 10 cm, but Lyc. schilleriana is 16‚Äì18 cm across. Some Lycaste blooms have a unique fragrance - the scent of Lyc. aromatica has been variously described as cinnamon or clove. The blooms of the species Lyc. cochleata, consobrina, and cruenta also have a pleasant scent.  Taxonomy  The World Checklist of Selected Plant Families, maintained by the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, is recognized by the American Orchid Society as the definitive authority on orchid taxonomy. The Checklist currently acknowledges 31 species of Lycaste, 3 natural hybrids, 2 subspecies (and 1 nominate subspecies), and 1 variety. Orchid growers and orchid collectors, who tend to be taxonomic \\"splitters\\" more often than \\"lumpers\\" (see lumpers and splitters), recognize additional subspecies and varieties of Lycaste, as well as alba (white) forms of several species.  Sections  The Lycastes have been divided into four sections, one of which has two subsections: *Section Deciduosae - deciduous, that is, they usually lose their leaves during an annual dormant period **Subsection Xanthanthae - have yellow to orange blooms; the name is from xantho - yellow, and anthos - flower **Subsection Paradeciduosae - have pink-marked white blooms; the name is from para- similar or near, and deciduosae- deciduous ones *Section Longisepalae - has very long sepals *Section Macrophyllae - keep their leaves during dormancy; the name is from macro- large and phyllae- leaves *Section Fimbriatae - typically have fringed lips All but two of the Deciduosae have spines at the apices of their pseudobulbs, that become exposed when the leaves are dropped - the exceptions are a Xanthanthae species, Lycaste lasioglossa, and a Paradeciduosae species, Lycaste tricolor. Both of these species lack spines, and may bloom when leaves are still present.  List of species by section  The recognized Xanthanthae species include: *Lycaste aromatica, *Lycaste bradeorum, *Lycaste campbelli, *Lycaste cochleata, *Lycaste consobrina, *Lycaste crinita, *Lycaste cruenta, *Lycaste deppei, *Lycaste lasioglossa, *Lycaste macrobulbon. Lycaste aromatica The Paradeciduosae species include: *Lycaste brevispatha, *Lycaste tricolor. Lycaste Cassipeia \\"Autumn glow\\" (a cultivar) The Macrophyllae form a large complex, with subspecies and varieties that can be considered to be in the process of differentiating into new full species. The Macrophyllae species include: Lycaste xytriophora L. dowiana *Lycaste dowiana, *Lycaste leucantha, *Lycaste macrophylla ** Lycaste macrophylla var. desboisiana ** Lycaste macrophylla subsp. macrophylla **Lycaste macrophylla subsp. puntarenasensis **Lycaste macrophylla subsp. xanthocheila *Lycaste neglecta, *Lycaste powellii, *Lycaste skinneri, *Lycaste xytriophora. The Fimbriatae species include: *Lycaste longipetala, *Lycaste mesochlaena.

The 34 species of Ida occur in South America or in the Caribbean Islands (Ida barringtoniae), while true Lycastes occur mostly in Mexico and Central America. The genus Ida is recognized by the World Checklist of Monocotyledons.

Biological oceanography may also be referred to as ocean ecology, in which the root word of ecology is oikos (oŒπŒ∫oœÉ), meaning ‚Äòhouse‚Äô or ‚Äòhabitat‚Äô in Greek. With that in mind, it is of no surprise then that a main focus of biological oceanography is on the microorganisms within the ocean; looking at how they are affected by their environment and how that affects larger marine creatures and their ecosystem.Lalli, Carol M., and Timothy R. Parsons. \\"Introduction.\\" Biological Oceanography: An Introduction. First Edition ed. Tarrytown, New York: Pergamon, 1993. 7-21. Print. Biological oceanography is similar to marine biology, but is different because of the perspective used to study the ocean. Biological oceanography takes a bottom up approach (in terms of the food web), while marine biology studies the ocean from a top down perspective. Biological oceanography mainly focuses on the ecosystem of the ocean with an emphasis on plankton: their diversity (morphology, nutritional sources, motility, and metabolism); their productivity and how that plays a role in the global carbon cycle; and their distribution (predation and life cycle).Menden-Deuer, Susanne. \\"Course Info.\\" OCG 561 Biological Oceanography. Miller, Charles B., and Patricia A. Wheeler. Biological Oceanography. Second ed. Chinchester, West Sussex: John Wiley & Sons, 2012. Print. Some of the main questions that biological oceanographers seek to answer may include: what sorts of organisms inhabit different sectors and depths of the ocean and why? A lot of biological oceanographic research studies the production of organic matter by ocean life and examines what factors affect their growth, and as a result the production rates of organic matter. Some biological oceanographers look at the relationships between organisms themselves, all the way from microbes to whales, and some look at the relationships between certain organisms and the chemical or physical characteristics of the ocean. Biological oceanographers also seek to answer questions with a more direct and immediate impact on humans- such as asking what we can expect to harvest from the sea, and answering how the weather, seasons, or recent natural disasters may affect the fisheries‚Äô harvest. Some of the main questions at the moment and for the future is looking at how climate change will affect the ocean biota.  History  In 325 BC, Pytheas of Massalia, a Greek geographer, explored much of the coast of England and Norway and developed the means of determining latitude from the declination of the North Star. His account of tides is also one of the earliest accounts that suggests a relationship between them and the moon. This relationship was later developed by English monk Bede in De Temporum Ratione (The Reckoning of Time) around 700 AD. Understanding the ocean began with general exploration and voyaging for trade. Some notable events closer to our time, include Prince Henry the Navigator‚Äôs ocean exploration in the 1400s. In 1513, Ponce de Leon described the Florida Current. In 1674, Robert Boyle investigated the relationship between salinity, temperature, and pressure in the depths of the ocean. Captain James Cook‚Äôs voyages were responsible for extensive data collection on geography, geology, biota, currents, tides, and water temperatures of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans in the 1760s and 1770s. In 1820, Alexander Marcet noted the varying chemical composition of seawater in the different oceans. Not long after, in 1843, Edward Forbes, a British naturalist, stated that marine organisms could not exist deeper than 300 fathoms (even though many had already collected organisms much deeper, many followed Forbes' influence). Forbes‚Äô theory was finally believed to be incorrect by the masses when submarine cable was lifted from a depth of 1830 m and covered in animals. This finding began the plans for the Challenger Expedition. The Challenger Expedition was pivotal to biological oceanography and oceanography in general. The Challenger Expedition was headed by Charles Wyville Thomson in 1872-1876. The expedition also included two other naturalists, Henry N. Moseley and John Murray. Prior to the expedition, the ocean was, although interesting to many, considered an unpredictable and mostly life-less body of water and this expedition made them rethink this stance on the ocean This expedition was at the behest of The Royal Society in order to see if they would be able to lay cables at the bottom of the ocean. They also brought the equipment to collect data about the biological, chemical, and geological properties of the ocean in a systematic way. They mapped the oceanic sediment and collected data The data collected in this voyage proved that there was life in deep waters (5500 meters) and that the composition of water in the ocean is consistent. The success of the Challenger Expedition led to many more expeditions by the Germans, French, US, and other British explorers. Motivation Oceans occupy about 71% of the Earth‚Äôs surface. Whilst the average depth of the oceans is about 3800 m, the deepest parts are almost 11000 m. The marine environment has a total volume (approximately 1370 x 106 km3) that is 300 times larger for life than the volume of land and freshwater combined. It is thought that the earliest organisms originated in the ancient oceans, long before any forms of life appeared on land. Ocean biology is dominated by organisms that are fundamentally different from organisms on land and the time scales of the ocean are much different than the atmosphere (whilst the atmosphere exchanges globally every 3 weeks, the ocean can take 1000 years). For these reasons we cannot make assumptions about ocean life based on what we know from land and atmospheric models. The range of diversity of life in the ocean is one of the main motivations behind the continued study of biological oceanography. Such range in diversity means there is a need for range in equipment and tools used to study the diversity. With the ocean organisms being much more inaccessible and not easily observable (relative to terrestrial organisms), there is a slower growth of knowledge and a consistent need for further exploration and study. The second main motivation behind the continued study of biological oceanography is climate change. Biological oceanography ties closely with physical and chemical oceanography and the details we learn from biological oceanography tell us information about the bigger picture and help us build models of larger scale processes. Such models are even more critical when the global environment is changing at an unprecedented rate. There are global patterns in environmental conditions, such as changes in pH, temperature, salinity, and CO2, but not everywhere sees the same change. The ocean makes the earth habitable through regulation of the Earth‚Äôs climate and processes such as primary production which provide oxygen as a byproduct. Biology is central to facilitating some of these processes but with climate change and human impacts, the ocean environment is constantly changing and so calls for consistent and continued research.

Illinois 166 is an undivided two-lane road for its entire length.  History  A road connecting Marion to New Burnside was first marked on Illinois highway maps in 1922. Route 166 was designated along its current route in 1924 as a paved road wide connecting New Burnside and Creal Springs. The route was first marked between Route 13 and Creal Springs on the 1929 state highway map; at this point, it had not been paved. By 1931, Route 166 was completed to New Burnside and paved between Route 13 and Caneyville, a community north of Creal Springs. The 1931 map marked the route as Illinois Route 156 in error. The remainder of the route was paved by 1934.

West of Harker is Summerland Swamp, and to the East is the Okaloacoochee Slough. Harker was a stop on the Haines City Branch branch of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad and was home mainly to farm workers who road the train daily to work sites farther south.

Early years Born in Rawtenstall, Rossendale, Lancashire, Cartwright was signed from school as a trainee in 1989 by North End boss John McGrath. Under McGrath's successor, Les Chapman, he made his first team debut at the age of 18 in a 1‚Äì0 home win against Shrewsbury Town in March 1991. Having broken into the first team, Cartwright remained a regular for the rest of the season. In the following season, 1991‚Äì92, he missed only a handful of matches as he picked up the club's player of the year award as reward for a string of consistently good displays. In 1992-93, Preston were relegated from the Football League Second Division, although Cartwright's performances attracted interest from both Oldham Athletic and Blackpool. Persuaded to stay by new manager John Beck, Cartwright would remain at Deepdale for the next eleven years. A Preston legend In his thirteen years at the club, Cartwright became a North End legend making a total of 472 appearances for the club, scoring 30 goals. He was an important member of the Preston teams that won the 1995‚Äì96 Third Division title and 1999‚Äì2000 Second Division title. Cartwright also played in the 1993‚Äì94 Third Division and 2000‚Äì01 First Division play-off final defeats. After Preston In January 2004, Cartwright moved to Stockport County on a free transfer, where his 18-month stay was disrupted by injury, and then to Rochdale, where injuries limited him to 29 appearances before he was released. Cartwright joined Conference North side Scarborough for the 2006‚Äì07 season, where he won the club's last ever Player of the Year award before their liquidation. Cartwright signed for Hyde United for the 2007-08 Conference North season, before retiring from football.

As for other glucosinolates, degradation by the enzyme myrosinase is expected to produce an isothiocyanate, indol-3-ylmethylisothiocyanate. However, this specific isothiocyanate is expected to be highly unstable, and has indeed never been detected. The observed hydrolysis products when isolated glucobrassicin is degraded by myrosinase are indole-3-carbinol and thiocyanate ion (plus glucose, sulfate, and hydrogen ion), which are envisioned to result from a rapid reaction of the unstable isothiocyanate with water. However, a large number of other reaction products are known, and indole-3-carbinol is not the dominant degradation product when glucosinolate degradation takes place in crushed plant tissue or in intact plants. Glucobrassicin is also known to be a highly active egg-laying stimulant of cabbage white butterflies such as the small white (Pieris rapae) and the large white (Pieris brassicae). Several derivatives of glucobrassicin are known. The compound itself was first isolated from Brassica plants, hence the ending of the name. When a second, similar natural product was discovered, it was named neoglucobrassicin. When further derivatives were discovered, a more systematic nomenclature was used. Currently, the following six derivatives are known from plants: * 1-Methoxyglucobrassicin (neoglucobrassicin) * 4-Hydroxyglucobrassicin * 4-Methoxyglucobrassicin * 1,4-Dimethoxyglucobrassicin * 1-Sulfoglucobrassicin * 6'-Isoferuloylglucobrassicin The three first mentioned derivatives are as frequent in crucifers as glucobrassicin itself. The additional three derivatives appear to be rare in nature. 4-methoxyglucobrassicin was recently reported to be a signal molecule involved in plant defence against bacteria and fungi. Biosynthesis from tryptophan The biosynthesis of glucobrassicin begins with tryptophan produced through several steps from the Shikimic acid pathway compound, chorismic acid. Tryptophan is converted to indole-3-acetaldoxime (IAOx) by cytochrome p450 enzymes (the redundant CYP92B3 and CYP79B3 in Arabidopsis thaliana) using NADPH and molecular Oxygen. A separate p450 enzyme (CYP83B1 in Arabidopsis) catalyzes a second subsequent monooxygenase reaction to create a proposed the intermediate 1-aci- nitro-2-indolyl-ethane. A cysteine is utilized by glutathione S-transferase (GST) in a conjugation process to produce a S-alkylthiohydroximate derivative, which is then cleaved off by a C-S lyase (like the SUR1 enzyme found in Arabidopsis) to create a free thiol. A single glucosylation occurs attaching a glucose molecule to the indole hydroximate through a thioether linkage. Finally, the hydroximate itself is sulfated creating glucobrassicin.

Its main goal was the struggle against the Soviet Union after 1944 (see Soviet occupation of Poland). NIE was one of the best hidden structures of Armia Krajowa, active until 7 May 1945. Its commanders were Generals Leopold Okulicki and Emil August Fieldorf. One of the first members of the organisation was Witold Pilecki. Origins of the organization date back to the second half of 1943, when on September 27, the Polish government-in-exile stated that conspirational activities should be maintained during the possible Soviet occupation of the country. Organization, statutes and structure of NIE was created by high-ranking officers of the Home Army, and among those involved were General Tadeusz Komorowski, and Polish Commander in Chief, General Kazimierz Sosnkowski. Members of NIE were carefully selected, and ordered to break their ties with soldiers of the Home Army. In May 1944, General Leopold Okulicki was named commander of NIE. The organization however failed to achieve its objectives, due to the Warsaw Uprising and Operation Tempest, which took place in the summer of 1944. Its structures were disorganized, and there was no communication with branches located east of the German-Soviet frontline. Most officers of NIE took part in the Warsaw Uprising, and after its capitulation were captured by the Wehrmacht. On November 22, 1944, General Okulicki was ordered to create a conspirational network in Eastern Borderlands, but his efforts failed. On January 16, 1945, a meeting of General Okulicki, General Fieldorf, Jan Stanislaw Jankowski and Stanislaw Jasiukowicz took place in Krakow. On March 7, however, Fieldorf was arrested by the NKVD, and sent to Siberia. On March 27, the Soviets arrested Okulicki (see Trial of the Sixteen). After these arrests, NIE was briefly commanded by Colonel Antoni Sanojca, who, with permission of General Wladyslaw Anders, dissolved it on May 7, 1945. According to its statutes, NIE was an organization aimed at long-term anti-Communist activities. It concentrated on self-defense, propaganda, and gathering information, also about the morale of soldiers of both the Red Army, and the Armia Ludowa. NIE did not plan any guerilla activity.

Early life and education Born as Kim Soo- jin, she made her entertainment debut at 17 years old as part of the group Punsudeul (\\"Idiots\\") in 1989, when she was still in high school. Career In 1994, using the stage name Yoo Chae-yeong, she became one of the original members of the popular K-pop group Cool. She initially attracted media attention for sporting a shaved head, which at the time was a bold hairstyle rarely seen on female South Korean celebrities. Yoo left Cool a year later, going on to make up one half of the duo US in 1995. She embarked on a solo singing career in 1996, and her hit song \\"Emotion\\" (released in 1999), contributed to the nationwide spread of techno music. As an actress, Yoo appeared in supporting roles in movies and television dramas, notably in the comedy film Sex Is Zero (2002) and its sequel Sex Is Zero 2 (2007). She was also a popular radio host on the MBC program Good Weekend, It's Kim Kyung-sik and Yoo Chae-yeong, known for her quick wit and self-deprecating humor.

He was born at Glenmore, Nelson County, Virginia to Robert Lawrence Brown and Sarah Cabell Callaway Brown, the eldest of three children but only one to survive childhood. His paternal grandfather, also named Alexander Brown, was born near Perth, Scotland and came to Virginia in 1811, where he married Virginian Lucy Shandes Rives. On his mother's side, he came from one of Virginia's oldest families, the Cabells, who hailed from Buckinghamshire. He was descended from American Revolution officer Col. William Cabell. Two of his great-uncles, Alexander Rives and William Cabell Rives, were Virginian lawyers and politicians. His mother died in 1849, and he was raised by his grandmother until his father remarried in 1853. He was educated by private tutors from 1851‚Äì56 and then at a school in Charlottesville, Virginia from 1856‚Äì60. He studied for a short time at Lynchburg College until the American Civil War broke out. He joined the Confederate army, serving for four years until he was rendered \\"stone deaf\\" by the famous explosion at Fort Fisher in January 1865. Despite being deaf, after the war he engaged in mercantile pursuits and farming. In 1873, he married his distant cousin, Caroline Augusta Cabell, who died in 1876. He remarried to Caroline Cabell's sister, Sarah Randolph Cabell, in 1886. Brown studied the early history of Virginia from the standpoint of the Virginia Company and became convinced that the early history of the commonwealth had not been truly written. To correct what he considered misconceptions and misjudgments was the aim of his various works, which included magazine articles and papers read before historical societies. His publications include New Views on Early Virginia History (1886), a pamphlet; The Genesis of the United States (two volumes, 1890), a valuable collection of previously unprinted historical manuscripts and of rare tracts; The Cabells and their Kin (1895); The First Republic in America (1898), an account of the early history of Virginia; The History of our Earliest History (1898); and English Politics in Early Virginia History (1901). He died in Norwood, Nelson County, Virginia, in 1906.

However, a video of him was aired across the world, as in the 1995 Norwegian Championships in Meldal he lost one of his two skis, but still managed to complete the jump and landing. In the 1995‚Äì1996 World Cup he competed more often, and recorded a fourth place, an eleventh and a fifteenth place. He also participated in the 1996 Ski-Flying World Championships. In his last World Cup season, the 1996‚Äì1997 World Cup, he had his best performance in the season opener with a seventh place in Lillehammer.

It was released in November 2001 as the lead single from his debut studio album of the same name (2002). The track, along with some others, was recorded in Bedingfield's bedroom with his PC and a microphone, using the music software Reason. The single went to number one on the UK Singles Chart in both 2001 and 2002, making it one of Bedingfield's most successful singles on the chart. Outside the United Kingdom, the single peaked within the top ten of the charts in Australia, Canada and the United States. In the latter country, it received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Dance Recording but lost to \\"Days Go By\\" by Dirty Vegas. The single became Britain's sixteenth biggest-selling single of 2001 and has since been certified platinum. Song background Bedingfield was inspired to write this while walking across Tower Bridge in London frustrated at being separated from a girl he was in love with from Leeds, in the north of England. The girl was a red-haired American dancer named Gina, and he was upset that the distance between them was preventing him from pursuing her. Music video The music video features Bedingfield looking for a woman in a number of locations in London, most notably West India Quay, a bridge connecting West India to Canary Wharf, and the Canary Wharf Docklands area. He is pursuing a woman he may know and comes inches close while chasing her around Docklands Light Railway, and eventually meets her at Canary Wharf. Canadian director Little X directed the video. A second version of the video, also directed by Little X, was created for North America.

He was out of the racing mare Fanfreluche, a daughter of the 20th Century's most influential sire, Northern Dancer. Trained by Yonnie Starr, in 1974 L'Enjoleur was voted the Sovereign Award as Canadian champion two-year-old plus the most prestigious of all, the Sovereign Award for Horse of the Year. Included in his 1974 wins was the important Grade 1 Laurel Futurity in Baltimore in which he defeated Wajima while equalling the track record time. At age three, L'Enjoleur earned both titles again, becoming the first repeat winner of \\"Horse of the Year\\" honours in the award's 25 year history. L'Enjoleur's 1975 campaign included victory in the first two legs of the Canadian Triple Crown. He captured the Queen's Plate in June then the Prince of Wales Stakes in July before finishing third on the grass in the August Breeders' Stakes. L'Enjoleur was retired to stud at the end of the 1975 season with a race record of 15-4-2 in 30 starts.

The position is similar to that of Lord Steward in England. History The original name of the office was Sovereign Master of the Hotel of the King French: Souverain Ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel du Roi', until 1380, then becoming Grand Master of the Hotel of the King (French: Grand Ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel du Roi), until 1463, before finally becoming Grand Master of France. The symbol of the Grand Master was a blue baton charged with golden fleur-de-lis, similar to the royal coat of arms of France, capped with a golden representation of the French royal crown. The Grand Master was entitled to bear this symbol of his office in his coat of arms, two being crossed in saltire behind the shield.  Duties  The position was a successor to the earlier positions of Mayor of the Palace and Seneschal of France. One of the highest posts in the French court, the \\"Grand ma√Ætre\\" directed the Maison du Roi, appointed new officers to the \\"Maison\\" (who would swear an oath of service in his hands) and managed the budget of the \\"Maison\\". He was also responsible for policing the court and he managed the king's lands (which made him a sort of Minister of the Interior). In practice however, the military branch of the Maison du Roi was frequently run by the Constable of France or the Secretary of State for War. He had numerous ceremonial duties. At the death of the king he would lead the funeral procession and, at the king's tomb, he would break his baton, throw it into the tomb and intone \\"Gentlemen, the King is dead; you are free from his service\\"; he would then take a new baton and intone \\"Gentlemen, the King lives, and gives you your posts.\\" In the Early Modern period, most of the real work of the Grand ma√Ætre was accomplished by his secretaries, and not by himself personally. His role was thus generally symbolic, although he often took personal charge of his ceremonial duties. Furthermore, with the creation of the Secretary of State of the Maison du Roi in the 16th century, the Grand ma√Ætre was forced to share some of his duties: in general the Secretary's oversight was purely formal, as the officers of the \\"Maison du Roi\\" were under the direct authority of the Grand Ma√Ætre of France; yet, the \\"Secr√©taire d'√âtat √† la Maison du Roi\\" was in charge of recruiting officers for the \\"Maison du Roi\\", and would receive prospective applications for posts and submit them to the king for his approval.  Officeholders  The position was frequently given to the highest of the nobility or to the king's close friends. Francis I conferred it upon his former teacher Artus Gouffier, then to his uncle Ren√© de Savoie, the \\"grand b√¢tard de Savoie\\", then to his friend Anne, duc de Montmorency. In 1559, with the dismissal of Montmorency, the office fell into the hands of the Dukes of Guise, who used the position to increase their influence at court to such a point that Henry III forced Henry I, Duke of Guise to reduce his scope of authority. In 1594, the position passed into the control of the House of Bourbon and the Princes of Cond√©, who maintained control until the French Revolution (except for the period 1654‚Äì1656, when it was held by Thomas of Savoy-Carignano, who had replaced the Guises as foremost of the princes √©trangers).

Early life Christoph Bartholom√§us Anton Migazzi was born in 1714, in the Prince-Bishopric of Trent, part of the County of Tyrol, part of the Holy Roman Empire. At nine years of age he entered the school for pages at the residence of Prince-Bishop Lamberg of Passau, who later proposed him for admittance to the Collegium Germanicum in Rome. At the age of twenty-two he returned to the Tyrol to study civil and canon law. Cardinal Lamberg took him as a companion to the Conclave of 1740, whence Benedict XIV came forth pope; Cardinal Lamberg recommended Migazzi to the new pope. Migazzi remained at Rome, as he stated, \\"in order to quench my thirst for the best science at its very source\\". About philosophy he stated about this time: > Without a knowledge of philosophy wit is merely a light fragrance which is > soon lost, and erudition a rude formless mass without life or movement, > which rolls onward unable to leave any mark of its passage, consuming > everything without itself deriving any benefit therefrom. In 1745, he was appointed auditor of the Rota for the German nation. Patronage of Maria Theresa Owing to the friendship of Benedict XIV, Migazzi concluded several transactions to the satisfaction of the Habsburg Empress Maria Theresa, who in return appointed him in 1751 coadjutor to the aged Archbishop of Mechlin. Upon being consecrated bishop, Migazzi was removed to Madrid as ambassador in Spain. After concluding a treaty, in 1756, the Empress appointed him coadjutor of Count Bishop Althan of Waitzen. But as Althan died before Migazzi's arrival, and six months later Prince Archbishop Trantson also died in Vienna, the Empress named Migazzi his successor. The Cathedral of the Assumption and St Michael in V√°c, Hungary. In 1761, Maria Theresa appointed him administrator-for-life of the Bishopric of V√°c, and at the same time obtained the cardinal's red for him from Clement XIII. Migazzi was thus in possession of two sees, the revenues of which he applied to their improvement. In V√°c (Waitzen), he erected the cathedral and episcopal palace and founded the Collegium pauperum nobilium and a convent. After twenty-five years of his administration, the Concilium locum tenens regium asked him if there was any priest in his diocese in possession of two benefices or offices, as in that case it was Emperor Joseph II's pleasure that one of them should be given up. Migazzi was forced to resign from V√°c. During Maria Theresa's reign in Austria, the so-called Enlightenment era (Aufkl√§rung) developed. \\"The Masonic lodge of the Three Canons\\" was printed at Vienna in 1742 and at Prague, in 1749, the \\"Three Crowned Stars and Honesty\\". In a memorial to the Empress, written in 1769, the Archbishop designated as the primary causes of current evils the spirit of the times, atheistic literature, the pernicious influence of many professors, the condition of the censorship, contemporary literature, the contempt of the clergy, the bad example of the nobility, the conduct of affairs of state by irreligious persons and neglect of the observance of holy days. Pope Clement XIV suppressed the Society of Jesus, but Migazzi endeavoured to save it for Austria. He wrote to the Empress: > If the members of the order are dispersed, how can their places be so easily > supplied? What expense will be entailed and how many years must pass before > the settled condition broken up by the departure of these priests can be > restored? Twenty years later, the Cardinal wrote to Francis I: > Even the French envoy who was last here, did not hesitate, as I can prove to > your Majesty, to say that if the Jesuits had not been suppressed, France > would not have experienced that Revolution so terrible in its consequences. Empress Maria Theresa in 1772 Migazzi opposed, as far as they were anticlerical. the government monopoly of educational matters, the \\"enlightened\\" theology, the \\"purified\\" law, the \\"enlightenment\\" literature, \\"tolerance\\" and encroachment on purely religious matters. He also founded the \\"Wiener Priesterseminar\\", an establishment for the preparation of young priests for parochial work. At Rome, his influence obtained for the Austrian monarch the privilege of being named in the Canon of the Mass. Migazzi lived to see the election of three popes. Maria Theresa and Kaunitz took a lively interest in his accounts of what transpired in the conclave (23 November 1775 ‚Äì 16 February 1776), which elected Pope Pius VI who subsequently visited Vienna during the reign of Joseph II. That pope owed his election to Migazzi, leader of the Royalist party. The Empress, in a letter to Migazzi sent during the conclave, wrote: \\"I am as ill-humoured as though I had been three months in conclave. I pray for you; but I am often amused to see you imprisoned.\\" Rise of Josephinism When Frederick II of Prussia heard of the death of the Empress he wrote, \\"Maria Theresa is no more. A new order of things will now begin.\\" The Edict of Tolerance of 1781 Joseph II, during his ten years' reign, published 6200 laws, court ordinances and decrees affecting the Catholic Church. The first measures, leveled against ecclesiastical jurisdiction, created dissatisfaction as encroachments on the rights of the Church. Cardinal Migazzi sent a number of memorials to Joseph II. Migazzi opposed all the Josephist reform decrees injurious to the Church. The \\"simplified and improved studies\\", the new methods of ecclesiastical education (general seminaries), interference with the constitutions of religious orders, the suppression of convents and violations of their rights and interference with the matrimonial legislation of the Church, called for vigorous protests on the Cardinal's part; but though he protested unceasingly, it was of no avail. After Pius VI's visit to Vienna, the Holy See pronounced no solemn condemnation of Josephinism. On 12 March 1790, Leopold, Grand Duke of Tuscany, arrived in Vienna, as successor of his brother Joseph, and as early as 21 March, Migazzi presented him with a memorial concerning the sad condition of the Austrian Church. He mentioned thirteen \\"grievances\\" and pointed out for each the means of redress: laxity in monastic discipline; the general seminaries; marriage licenses; and the \\"Religious Commission\\", which assumed the position of judge of the bishops and their rights. Migazzi expressed his dissatisfaction. Later years Emperor Francis II confirmed the Josephist system throughout his reign. During the French Revolutionary Wars, the \\"Religious Commission\\" paid little heed to the representations of the bishops. The Cardinal insisted on its abolition, stating: > I am in all things your Majesty's obedient subject, but in spiritual matters > the shepherd must say fearlessly that it is a scandal to all Catholics to > see such fetters laid upon the bishops. The scandal is even greater when > such power is vested in worldly, questionable, even openly dangerous and > disreputable men. In another matter, he wrote: > The dismal outlook of the Church in your Majesty's dominion is all the more > grievous from the fact that one must stand by in idleness, while he realizes > how easily the increasing evils could be remedied, how easily your Majesty's > conscience could be calmed, the honour of Almighty God, respect for the > Faith and the Church of God be secured, the rightful activities of the > priesthood set free, and religion and virtue restored to the Catholic > people. All this would follow at once, if only your Majesty, setting aside > further indecision, would resolve generously and perseveringly to close once > for all the sources of so great evil. The Emperor made concessions, greeted by Migazzi with satisfaction. When the pilgrimage to Maria Zell was once more permitted, the Cardinal in person led the first procession. Migazzi died in Vienna on 14 April 1803. His body is buried in St. Stephen's Cathedral.

It has also been covered by artists such as Leon Russell, Marianne Faithfull, Spock's Beard, Concrete Blonde, and the duo of Matthew Sweet and Susanna Hoffs. Harrison and Russell performed the song at the Concert for Bangladesh in 1971, and Eric Clapton performed it at the Concert for George in 2002. The song warns against permitting illusion from getting in the way of one's true purpose, an admonition that, like the content of \\"My Sweet Lord\\", reflects the influence of the Radha Krishna Temple. Lyrics and music \\"Beware of Darkness\\" is a ballad containing dense imagery. The song marks a return to the spiritual concerns of Harrison's songs with the Beatles such as \\"Within You Without You\\". The lyrics of \\"Beware of Darkness\\" reflect the philosophy of the Radha Krishna Temple, with which Harrison was involved, in which spiritual concerns must always override material things. In the verses, the listener is warned against various influences that may corrupt them. Among the potential corrupting influences are con men (\\"soft shoe shufflers\\"), politicians (\\"greedy leaders\\") and pop idols of little substance (\\"falling swingers\\"). In addition, the lyrics warn against negative thoughts (\\"thoughts that linger\\"), since these corrupting influences and negative thoughts can lead to maya, or illusion, which distracts people from the true purpose of life. The middle eight delivers the message that this \\"can hurt you\\", and that \\"that is not what you are here for.\\" Author Simon Leng describes the melody of \\"Beware of Darkness\\" as \\"complex and highly original\\". The melody of the verses incorporates a pedal point on the key of G major and moves to G sharp minor, a progression Leng claims \\"should not work in harmonic terms\\", using as an analogy a count of \\"one, two, six\\", but notes that somehow the melody manages to work. Music professor Wilfrid Mellers explains the effectiveness of this key shift as dramatising the \\"beware\\" in the lyrics. Similarly, Mellers claims that harmonic movement from the key of C sharp minor to D major to C major \\"creates the 'aimless' wandering of 'each unconscious sufferer'\\" described in the lyrics. The nearly chromatic melody of the verses contrasts with a more standard rock melody in the middle eight. The musicians on the recording include Harrison, Eric Clapton and Dave Mason on guitar, Carl Radle on bass guitar, Bobby Whitlock on piano, Gary Wright on organ and Ringo Starr on drums. Reception In his contemporary review of All Things Must Pass, Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone wrote that \\"Beware of Darkness\\" was possibly the album's best song, commenting on its \\"enigmatic\\" music and the combination of \\"warning\\" and \\"affirmation\\" in its lyrics. AllMusic critic Richie Unterberger similarly views \\"Beware of Darkness\\" as one of the highlights of All Things Must Pass. In his feature on Harrison's solo career for Goldmine magazine in 2002, Dave Thompson paired it with \\"Art of Dying\\" as songs that \\"rate among the finest compositions of Harrison's entire career\\".Dave Thompson, \\"The Music of George Harrison: An album-by-album guide\\", Goldmine, 25 January 2002, p. 17. Rolling Stones Anthony DeCurtis terms it \\"haunting\\" and comments that the lyrics reflect fears that Harrison hoped to calm with his religious beliefs. Chip Madinger and Mark Easter call the song \\"a stunning composition\\", reflecting the considerable growth in Harrison's songwriting abilities since his early Beatle days. Writing for the music website Something Else!, Nick DeRiso includes \\"Beware of Darkness\\" among the highlights of Harrison's solo career on Apple Records; DeRiso describes it as Harrison's \\"best album's very best song ‚Äì one where he perfectly matches a lyrical meditation on overcoming life's harder moments ‚Ä¶ with the sound, mysticism and fury of one of the early 1970s' greatest amalgamations of sidemen\\". Writing for Mojo magazine in 2011, John Harris described the track as \\"simply jaw-dropping\\". American rock band Beware of Darkness are named after the song.  Personnel  The following musicians are believed to have played on Harrison's original version of \\"Beware of Darkness\\": *George Harrison ‚Äì vocals, electric guitar, slide guitars *Eric Clapton ‚Äì lead guitar *Dave Mason ‚Äì acoustic guitar *Bobby Whitlock ‚Äì piano *Gary Wright ‚Äì organ *Carl Radle ‚Äì bass guitar *Ringo Starr ‚Äì drums *John Barham ‚Äì string arrangement *uncredited ‚Äì vibraphone Other versions \\"Beware of Darkness\\" was one of the songs Harrison played at the Concert for Bangladesh at Madison Square Garden on 1 August 1971. Harrison sang the lead vocals for the first two verses, and then Leon Russell took over the lead for the third verse. It was played at both the afternoon and evening performances. The evening performance of the song was included on the album Concert for Bangladesh as well as the film of the concert. An acoustic version of \\"Beware of Darkness\\", which was recorded on 27 May 1970, was included on the Harrison bootleg album Beware of ABKCO! This version was later released on the 2001 remaster of All Things Must Pass. Russell recorded his version of \\"Beware of Darkness\\" on his 1971 album Leon Russell and the Shelter People. Australian critic Toby Creswell considered \\"Beware of Darkness\\" the highlight of the album, regarding this as the \\"definitive\\" version of the song, noting that Russell \\"brings chiaroscuro to this song about Eastern mysticism\\". The song was also included on several of Russell's compilation albums, including Gimme Shelter!: The Best of Leon Russell and The Best of Leon Russell. Marianne Faithfull included the song on her album Rich Kid Blues, which - though recorded in 1971 - was released in 1984 and also on her 2000 compilation album It's All Over Now Baby Blue. In 1986 the alternative American Band Concrete Blonde covered the song on their self-titled album. Spock's Beard used \\"Beware of Darkness\\" as the title track of their 1996 album Beware of Darkness, basing their version on Leon Russell's. Matthew Sweet and Susanna Hoffs covered \\"Beware of Darkness\\" on their 2009 album Under the Covers, Vol. 2. Eric Clapton performed \\"Beware of Darkness\\" at the George Harrison tribute concert Concert for George in 2002. Author Ian Inglis stated that Clapton's performance \\"captures the thoughtful intent of the original\\". Joe Cocker covered \\"Beware of Darkness\\" for his 2007 album Hymn for My Soul. In 2010 American singer Laura Martin recorded a version on her album Songs for the Fall. The Hardin Burns, an American duo consisting of guitarist Andrew Hardin and ex-Burns Sister Jeannie Burns, released a rendition of \\"Beware of Darkness\\" on their 2012 album Lounge. Sheryl Crow recorded a cover of the song for her 2019 album Threads. Crow's version also features Eric Clapton, Sting and Brandi Carlile.

These have included a parade, two theater-in-the- round shows, and four stage shows.  The Lion King Celebration  The Lion King Celebration was a parade that ran at Disneyland Park in California from June 1, 1994 to June 1, 1997. The parade's design centered around the story of Simba, the main protagonist of The Lion King, as if it were a tale passed down in Africa for generations.Disneyland Presents The Lion King Celebration: VHS The lineup featured six floats designed around different aspects of African culture, dancers dressed in animal costumes, and a Pride Rock float featuring Simba and Nala. The design of the parade had strong roots in traditional African artwork, featuring vibrant colors, traditional designs, and dance routines based on traditional African dances. The parade featured six floats, accompanied by a total of 89 cast members. This included 56 dancers, 12 puppeteers, 10 acrobatic pole dancers, 6 musicians and 5 remote control operators. The Lion King Celebration also featured the first use of Audio- Animatronics in a Disneyland parade as well as the first use of \\"Puppetronics\\", a technique used to create the large, lifelike animal puppets featured on the floats. Puppetronics allowed the animatronic animals to be controlled by a puppeteer but still retain complex movement, allowing for a smoother and more realistic performance. A commemorative VHS, hosted by Robert Guillaume, was released by the park featuring the parade and behind-the-scenes footage. After the parade's run ended in 1997, four of the floats were moved to Disney's Animal Kingdom for the Festival of the Lion King show. Other assets from the parade were reused in other parades, including Walt Disney's Parade of Dreams.  Plot  Set to a mostly instrumental version of the song \\"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\\", the first characters to appear are two rhinoceroses, followed by tribal dancers, drummers and a float featuring Zazu and Rafiki with two giraffes. Zazu and Rafiki introduce the parade as it continues down Main Street, U.S.A.. Next, a herd of gazelle dancers dressed in spandex costumes with hoods precede a float with tribal gazelle designs pushed along by wildebeest dancers. They are followed by a group of tribal crane dancers, the elephant float and two remote-controlled crocodiles. The elephant on the float occasionally shoots a stream of water from its trunk. In the first year of the show, the larger \\"mother\\" elephant was preceded by a smaller \\"baby\\" elephant whose costume was similar to that of the previously mentioned rhinoceroses, only larger. Two pole dancers dressed in tribal bird costumes walk at the sides. Leopard dancers dance around the Rain Forest float, which features monkey dancers on swings and Pumbaa on the back. Pumbaa talks to Timon, who follows behind while chasing three remote-controlled bugs including a scorpion and a rhinoceros beetle. Two tribal-bird pole dancers lead the Drum Dancer float, which features drummers, dancers and percussionists in colourful, vibrant tribal costumes. The last float - Pride Rock - is led by a group of zebra and cheetah dancers, two tribal elephant dancers and two tribal bird dancers. Simba stands atop Pride Rock while Nala roars and drums out the beat with her paw at the foot of the float. Above them, Mufasa's face is represented in a spinning sun design. The end of the parade is marked by two tribal zebra performers holding a rope. The parade eventually stops and Mufasa's voice is heard telling Simba to take his place in the Circle of Life. The song \\"Circle of Life\\" begins to play and the dancers dance and leap around the floats as the drummers drum along to the song. At the end of the song, Simba roars and white doves are released from one of the floats, symbolizing hope and peace.  Festival of the Lion King  Festival of the Lion King is a live stage musical performed at Disney's Animal Kingdom in Walt Disney World and in Adventureland at Hong Kong Disneyland. The show, an original interpretation of the Disney animated film The Lion King, uses songs, dance, puppetry and visual effects to portray a tribal celebration in an African savanna setting filled with lions, elephants, giraffes, birds, zebras and gazelles.  Disney's Animal Kingdom version  A dancer during a performance of ‚Äò‚ÄôFestival of the Lion King‚Äô‚Äô at Disney's Animal Kingdom. The Disney's Animal Kingdom version of the show is presented as a celebration with Simba and his friends (including a band of four human singers). The show is in the form of a revue, and not a condensed version of either the film or Broadway show. The show features Elton John and Tim Rice's award-winning music from the movie. The show is performed inside an enclosed theater-in-the-round. Guests sit in four sections, each designated with an animal name: Giraffe, Elephant, Warthog, Lion. These animals are represented by large puppets on four parade-style floats, which were originally built for Disneyland's The Lion King Celebration parade. The show is hosted by four performers dressed in costumes inspired by traditional African dress. Each has a Swahili name: Kiume (meaning \\"masculine and strong\\"), Nakawa (\\"good-looking\\"), Kibibi (\\"princess\\"), and Zawadi (\\"the gift\\"). After the hosts welcome the audience to the show, the curtains open and a procession of dancers, puppeteers, and stilt walkers enter the theater (\\"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\\"). Among them are Lion King characters Simba, Pumbaa (both puppets on floats), and Timon (played by a live performer). Acts include gymnastic \\"Tumble Monkeys\\" (\\"Hakuna Matata\\"), a fire knife-twirling hyena (\\"Be Prepared\\"), and an aerial dance featuring performers dressed as birds (\\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\\"), leading to an interactive sing-along (\\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\"), and watched first sing-along version (\\"Circle of Life\\") in celebrating African savannah animals gathered together forever. = Relocation = Due to the construction of Pandora ‚Äì The World of Avatar replacing Camp Minnie-Mickey (which was the show's original location), the show went into a five-month hiatus while a new theater, the Harambe Theater, was constructed in an unused dense forest area in the Africa section of the park. Construction on the Harambe Theater was completed in May 2014 and the show reopened there on June 1, 2014. This relocation was part of a wider expansion of Africa, which included a new path, restrooms, and new restaurants. = 2020 labor dispute = When Walt Disney World reopened in July 2020 following the COVID-19 shutdown, all stage shows such as Finding Nemo ‚Äì The Musical, Beauty and the Beast Live on Stage, Festival of the Lion King, and the Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular! remained closed due to a dispute between the Actors‚Äô Equity Association and Walt Disney World over allowing performers to wear face masks and providing regular testing.  Hong Kong Disneyland version  Musical at Hong Kong Disneyland The Hong Kong Disneyland version of the show is presented as simplified version of the story of The Lion King, told through songs from the movie. The show is performed in the \\"Theater in the Wild\\" in Adventureland. Similar to the theater setting in Disney's Animal Kingdom, guests sit in four different sections themed to a specific animal, and accompanied by a parade-style float. The performance is mainly in English, but two actors dressed as monkeys summarise and translate some of the lines into Cantonese in order to accommodate Hongkongese guests. Simplified Chinese subtitles, for Chinese visitors, are also projected onto the screens above each seating section. The show is presented to Simba by the Storyteller (portrayed by a female actress) as a re-telling of Simba's life. Simba is represented by a large, elaborate puppet on the \\"lion\\" float.  Soundtrack  A soundtrack CD was released in 2001, titled Festival of The Lion King (Disney's Animal Kingdom at Walt Disney World) Track listing:  Legend of The Lion King  The Legend of the Lion King show at the Magic Kingdom in the Walt Disney World in Florida was a stage performance retelling the story of the film using life size puppets. The show debuted on July 8, 1994 in the Fantasyland Theater. Legend of The Lion King replaced the 3-D movie Magic Journeys, which was shown in the theater from December 1987 through December 1993.Kurtti, Jeff (1996). Since the World Began: Walt Disney World, The First 25 Years. New York, New York: Hyperion. p. 65. This show featured what Disney described as \\"Disney Humanimals\\", which were \\"larger-than-life figures that look just like their animated film counterparts\\". The Mufasa \\"humanimal\\" measured long from tail to tip, feet tall, and was perched upon an Pride Rock that rose from below the stage. The stage for show was wide, and was bigger than the seating area in order to permit the use of giant sets. The attraction closed on February 23, 2002 to be replaced by Mickey's PhilharMagic.  The Legend of The Lion King  The Legend of The Lion King at Disneyland Paris ran from 2004 to 2009 and played at the Videopolis Theater located in Discoveryland.Videopolis (Disneyland Paris) This Broadway-style show used human actors, including some from the West End production of The Lion King, and featured popular songs from the movie. The show ran for 30 minutes and had performances in both English and French.  The Lion King: Rhythms of the Pride Lands  The Lion King: Rhythms of the Pride Lands debuted on June 30, 2019 at Disneyland Paris in the Frontierland Theater in Frontierland as part of \\"The Lion King & Jungle Festival\\". Disney describes the show as \\"a tribe of singers, dancers and acrobats dressed as Rafiki, Simba, Timon, Pumbaa, Nala, Mufasa and Scar brilliantly bring famous Pride Rock anthems to life.\\" Told in both English and Chansigne (a French sign language that interprets rhythms and song lyrics through interpretive hand movements), the show follows the story of The Lion King and features songs from both the film and the Broadway musical. The staging features a large, elaborate moving set based on djembe drums which rotate and tilt. The show closed on September 22, 2019. It returned on 15 August 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic it was cancelled twice and eventually the run was ended early. Soundtrack A soundtrack for the show was released in 2020.

Tom Snow was a member of the band Country, which released a sole album on Clean Records, a subsidiary of Atlantic Records in 1971. Snow sang co-lead and played piano. The band included Michael Fondiler, who shared lead vocals and played rhythm guitar, Bob DeSimone on drums, Steve Fondiler on bass and Ian Espinoza on lead guitar and dobro. Their little-known but assured self-titled debut featured Mark and Matt Andes of Spirit and Jo Jo Gunne and Lowell George of Little Feat. Vexed by management troubles - Michael O'Bryant was replaced by Peter Asher - the album sank without a trace. Re-released on the Slipstream label in 2013, the album garnered favourable reviews. Snow left after the first album, but the rest of the band continued, and a second album was recorded but never released. A single from those sessions, \\"Strange Arrangement\\", was released, which featured Snow and the rest of the band but was credited as a solo work by Ian Espinoza.

The term may also refer to the completed survey form or a summary of responses to questionnaires. They are a means to produce feedback which the teacher and school can use to assess their quality of instruction. The process of (a) gathering information about the impact of learning and of teaching practice on student learning, (b) analyzing and interpreting this information, and (c) responding to and acting on the results, is valuable for several reasons.Rahman, K. (2006). Learning from your business lectures: using stepwise regression to understand course evaluation data. Journal of American Academy of Business, Cambridge, 19(2), 272‚Äì279. They enable instructors to review how others interpret their teaching methods. The information can be also used by administrators, along with other input, to make summative decisions (e.g., decisions about promotion, tenure, salary increases, etc.) and make formative recommendations (e.g., identify areas where a faculty member needs to improve).Dunegan, K. J., & Hrivnak, M. W. (2003). Characteristics of mindless teaching evaluations and the moderating effects of image compatibility. Journal of Management Education, 27(3), 280‚Äì303. Typically, these evaluations are combined with peer evaluations, supervisor evaluations, and results of student‚Äôs test scores to create an overall picture of teaching performance. Course evaluations are implemented in one of two ways, either summative or formative. Course evaluation instruments Course evaluation instruments generally include variables such as communication skills, organizational skills, enthusiasm, flexibility, attitude toward the student, teacher ‚Äì student interaction, encouragement of the student, knowledge of the subject, clarity of presentation, course difficulty, fairness of grading and exams, and global student rating.Kim, C., Damewood, E., & Hodge, N. (2000). Professor attitude: its effect on teaching evaluations. Journal of Management Education, 24(4), 458‚Äì473.Tang, T. L.-P. (1997). Teaching evaluation at a public institution of higher education: factors related to the overall teaching effectiveness. Public Personnel Management, 26(3), 379‚Äì391. Summative evaluation Summative evaluation occurs at the end of a semester, usually a week or two before the last day of class. The evaluation is performed by the current students of the class. Students have the option to reflect on the teachers‚Äô instruction without fear of punishment because course evaluations are completely confidential and anonymous. This can be done in one of two ways; either with a paper form or with online technology. Typically, in a paper based format, the paper form is distributed by a student while the teacher is out of the room. It is then sealed in an envelope and the teacher will not see it until after final grades are submitted. The online version can be identical to a paper version or more detailed, using branching question technology to glean more information from the student. Both ways allow the student to be able to provide feedback. This feedback is to be used by teachers to assess the quality of their instruction. The information can also be used to evaluate the overall effectiveness of a teacher, particularly for tenure and promotion decisions.Mohanty, G., Gretes, J., Flowers, C., Algozzine, B., & Spooner, F. (2005). Multi-method evaluation of instruction in engineering classes. Journal of Personnel Evaluation in Education, 18(2), 139‚Äì151. Formative evaluation Formative evaluation typically occurs when changes can take place during the current semester, although many institutions consider written comments on how to improve formative as well. Typically this form of evaluation is performed by peer consultation. Other experienced teachers will review one of their peer‚Äôs instructions. The purpose of this evaluation is for the teacher to receive constructive criticism on teaching. Generally, peer teachers will sit in on a few lessons given by the teacher and take notes on their methods. Later on the team of peer teachers will meet with the said teacher and provide useful, non- threatening feedback on their lessons. The peer team will offer suggestions on improvement, which the said teacher can choose to implement. Peer feedback is given to the instructor typically in the form of an open session meeting. The peers first reflect on the qualities that were good in the instruction. Then they move on to areas that need improvement. Next the instructor will make suggestions for improvement and receive feedback on those ideas. Student feedback can be an important part of formative evaluation. Student evaluations are formative when their purpose is to help faculty members improve and enhance their teaching skills. The teachers may require their students to complete written evaluation, participate in ongoing dialogue or directed discussions during the course of the semester. The use of a 'Stop, Start Continue' format for student feedback has been shown to be highly effective at generating constructive feedback for course improvement.Hoon, A.E., Oliver, E., Szpakowska, K., and Newton P.M. 2014. Use of the ‚ÄòStop, Start, Continue‚Äô method is associated with the production of constructive qualitative feedback by students in higher education. Assessment and Evaluation in Higher Education. DOI:10.1080/02602938.2014.956282 At the Faculty of Psychology of the University of Vienna, Twitter was used for formative course evaluation.Stieger, S., & Burger, C. (2010). Let's go formative: continuous student ratings with Web 2.0 application Twitter. Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking, 13(2), 163‚Äì167. Criticism of course evaluations as measures of teaching effectiveness Summative student evaluations of teaching (SETs) have been widely criticized, especially by teachers, for not being accurate measures of teaching effectiveness.Emery, C. R., Kramer, T. R., & Tian, R.G. (2003). Return to academic standards: a critique of student evaluations of teaching effectiveness. Quality Assurance in Education, 11(1), 37‚Äì46.

Surveys have shown that a majority of teachers believe that a teacher's raising the level of standards and/or content would result in worse SETs for the teacher, and that students in filling out SETs are biased in favor of certain teachers' personalities, looks, disabilities, gender and ethnicity.Birnbaum, M. H. (1999). A survey of faculty opinions concerning student evaluations of teaching. The Senate Forum (California State University, Fullerton), 14(1), 19‚Äì22. Longer version with references. Retrieved 2011-06-16. The evidence that some of these critics cite indicates that factors other than effective teaching are more predictive of favorable ratings. In order to get favorable ratings, teachers are likely to present the content which can be understood by the slowest student. Consequently, the content has been affected. Many of those who are critical of SETs have suggested that they should not be used in decisions regarding faculty hires, retentions, promotions, and tenure. Some have suggested that using them for such purposes leads to the dumbing down of educational standards. Others have said that the typical way SETs are now used at most universities is demeaning to instructorsGray, M., & Bergmann, B. R.

For example, Weinberg et al. (2009) finds SET scores in first-year economics courses at Ohio State University are positively related to the grades instructors assign but are unrelated to learning outcomes once grades are controlled for.Weinberg, B. A., Hashimoto, M., & Fleisher, B. M. (2009). Evaluating teaching in higher education. Journal of Economic Education, 40(3), 227‚Äì261. Others have also found a positive relationship between grades and SET scores but unlike Weinberg et al. (2009) do not directly address the relationship between SET scores and learning outcomes.McPherson, M. A., Jewell, R. T., & Kim, M. (2009). What determines student evaluation scores?

Another paper by Carrell and West (2010) use a data set from the U.S. Air Force Academy where students are randomly assigned to course sections (reducing selection problems).Carrell, S.

It found that calculus students got higher marks on common course examinations when they had instructors with high SET scores but did worse when they took later courses requiring calculus. The authors discuss a number of possible explanations for this finding, including that instructors with higher SET scores may have concentrated their teaching on the common examinations in the course rather than giving students a deeper understanding for later courses. Hamermesh and West (2005) find that students at the University of Texas at Austin gave attractive instructors higher SET scores than less attractive instructors.Hamermesh, D. S., & Parker, A. (2005). Beauty in the classroom: instructors‚Äô pulchritude and putative pedagogical productivity. Economics of Education Review, 24(4), 369‚Äì376. However, the authors conclude that it may not be possible to determine if attractiveness increases the effectiveness of an instructor, possibly resulting in better learning outcomes. It may be the case that students pay more attention to attractive instructors. Meanwhile, a 2017 lawsuit was filed on grounds of xenophobic discrimination in course evaluations at the University of Kansas, with Peter F. Lake, the director of Stetson University's Center for Excellence in Higher Education Law and Policy, suggesting this is no isolated incident. The empirical economics literature is in sharp contrast to the educational psychology literature which generally argues that teaching evaluations are a legitimate method of evaluating instructors and are unrelated to grade inflation. However, similar to the economic literature other researchers outside of educational psychology have offered negative findings on course evaluations. For example, some papers have examined online course evaluations and found them to be heavily influenced by the instructor‚Äôs attractiveness and willingness to give high grades in return for very little work.Felton, J., Mitchell, J., & Stinson, M. (2004a). Web-based student evaluations of professors: the relations between perceived quality, easiness and sexiness. Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 29(1), 91‚Äì108.Felton, J., Mitchell, J., & Stinson, M. (2004b). Cultural differences in student evaluations of professors. Journal of the Academy of Business Education, Proceedings. Retrieved 2011-06-16. Another criticism of these assessment instruments is that largely the data they produce are difficult to interpret for purposes of self- or course-improvement, given the number of variables that can affect evaluation scores.Marks, P. (2012). Silent Partners: student course evaluations and the construction of pedagogical worlds . Canadian Journal for Studies in Discourse and Writing, 24(1). Finally, paper based course evaluations can cost a university thousands of dollars over the years, while an electronic survey is offered at minimal cost to the university. Another concern that has been raised by instructors is that response rates to online course evaluations are lower (and therefore the results may be less valid) than paper-based in class evaluations. The situation is more complex that response rates alone would indicate.Anderson, J., Brown, G., & Spaeth, S. (Aug/Sept 2006). Online student evaluations and response rates reconsidered. , Innovate (Fischler School of Education and Human Services, Nova Southeastern University), 2(6). Retrieved 2011-06-16.

This replaces the traditional method where invoices were sent in paper form and payments were done by manual means such as sending cheques. There are a number of advantages to electronic billing that include the faster presentation of invoices and reductions in costs in handling paper document. However to take full advantage of electronic billing both seller and buyer need to have in place computer systems able to handle electronic billing and have access to financial institutions that can do electronic payments. History The development of electronic billing and payments started in the late 20th century, and whilst its exact origins are unclear, it is generally agreed that development of electronic billing coincided with the rise of the Information Age. It went hand in hand with the development of internet banking, introduction of accounting software and widespread use of email. In the United States, the Council for Electronic Billing and Payment of the National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) is credited with broadly promoting and communicating various forms of electronic billing in the early 2000s. NACHA promoted activities and initiatives that facilitated the adoption of electronic payments in the areas of Internet commerce, electronic bill payment and presentment, financial electronic data interchange (EDI), international payments, electronic checks, electronic benefits transfer (EBT) and student lending. Certain electronic billing applications also provide the ability to electronically settle payment for goods or services. Types of electronic billing * Biller-direct ‚Äì where consumers make payments directly to one biller that issues bills that they receive at the website of the firm that issued the bill. An example would be of a public utility company offering this payment service to its consumers. A market has emerged for outsourced billing providers who specialize in electronic billing processes and technology for companies that need to send bills directly to their customers.Aite Group independent research firm report on biller-direct vendors by Gwenn Bezard. August 29, 2013. *Bank-aggregator ‚Äì where a payment is made at an aggregator or consolidator site, usually from a consumer's bank's website. This model allows the consumer to make payments to multiple billers that are pre-registered to receive payments. Examples are OneVu in the UK and eBill in Switzerland. Parties involved Billers, bankers, aggregators and consolidators can play various roles in the overall process. Once roles are defined, it is easier to identify which model is most appropriate for the client's strategy. Billers may also implement more than one model in order to best serve their clients. Because the industry is continuously changing and redefining, the options and opportunities will continue to expand. *Biller payment provider (BPP) ‚Äì An agent of the biller that accepts remittance information on behalf of the Biller. *Biller service provider (BSP) ‚Äì An agent of the biller that provides the service for the Biller. *Consolidator ‚Äì A biller service provider that consolidates bills from multiple Billers or other bill service providers (BSPs) and delivers them for presentment to the customer service provider (CSP).Information on several solutions *Customer service provider (CSP) ‚Äì An agent of the customer that provides an interface directly to customers, businesses or others for bill presentment. CSP enrolls customers, enables presentment and provides customer care, among other functions.  Slow development due to legacy systems  In developed countries existing legacy banking systems and rules has slowed down the development of electronic billing. For example, in the United States financial institutions typically formally prohibit the use of their consumer electronic bill payment systems for payments to certain agencies such as: collection agencies, or recipients of court-ordered payments like child support or alimony. Any organizations or individuals outside of the United States are also usually excluded. Payments to government agencies for utilities such as water are usually permitted. Electronic bill pay systems fall into two categories, \\"pay- anyone\\" services and restricted biller list services. In a pay-anyone service, the provider will facilitate a payment to the payee regardless of whether they have an electronic connection with that payee or not. If they cannot deliver the payment to the payee electronically, they will print and mail a paper check on the payer's behalf. The largest providers of electronic bill pay services can deliver about 80% of their payments electronically, so 20% of payments facilitated by the large pay-anyone services are still made by mailing a paper check to the biller. This is the primary reason why some billers in a pay-anyone service require as much as a 5-day lead time for the payment to reach the payee. Restricted biller list payment services allow you to pay any biller that is in the provider's network, and in these services where the provider has an electronic relationship with the biller, the payments will be delivered electronically.

Garvey's was the first voice on BBC Radio 5 Live when it launched at 5:00 am on 28 March 1994. While she was with Radio 5 Live she presented the breakfast programme and the relaunched Midday show, and co-presented its Drive show on weekday afternoons with Peter Allen, for which she and Allen won four Sony Gold Awards. Early life and education Garvey was born in Liverpool in 1964; her father is Ray Garvey, and her mother, Maureen (born O'Neill), was a hospital receptionist. She was educated at Merchant Taylors' Girls' School in Crosby, an independent school in Merseyside. She is a graduate in English of the University of Birmingham. Career Garvey was employed as a medical records clerk in a finance company, as a trainee for an advertising agency and as a receptionist, before becoming a promotions assistant for Radio Wyvern, where she later became news editor before leaving in 1988 to join BBC Hereford and Worcester as a reporter. The station began in February 1989. In that year, Garvey was presenter of The Breakfast Show at BBC Hereford and Worcester, where Ben Cooper (currently Controller of BBC Radio 1, digital station BBC 1Xtra and BBC Asian Network) worked as her assistant. Garvey's was the first voice on BBC Radio 5 Live when it launched at 5:00 am on 28 March 1994. She became the co- presenter of 5 Live's award-winning breakfast programme in 1994, and also presented the Everywoman programme on the BBC World Service. She was also the presenter of the relaunched Midday show on BBC Radio 5 Live (during which the award-winning Postcards from the Street series by Stan Burridge was broadcast). Her final long-term assignment on 5 Live was as co-presenter of its Drive show on weekday afternoons with Peter Allen. She and Allen have won four Sony Gold Awards, and their relationship on air was described in The Times in 2002 as \\"a marriage made in radio heaven\\". In September 1997, Garvey was a passenger on the Swansea train in the Southall rail crash, and received praise for her on-the-spot reports. In May 2007 in a discussion on the tenth anniversary of the Labour Party gaining power in the United Kingdom, Garvey unwittingly revealed an apparent pro-Labour bias at the BBC. She reminisced of how, the morning after the 1997 general election, \\"the corridors of Broadcasting House were strewn with empty champagne bottles ‚Äì I will always remember that\\", though adding that the BBC had \\"perhaps fallen out of love with Labour\\" in more recent years. In September 2007, it was announced that she would leave 5 Live after 13 years; on Monday 8 October 2007 she joined BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour programme as the second principal presenter, succeeding Martha Kearney in the role. She created a minor stir in February 2008 in an interview in The Guardian, describing Woman's Hour as too middle-class and fixated on cooking. She returned briefly to BBC Radio 5 Live in November 2011 as a stand-in presenter on the Double Take programme. In June 2016, it was announced that Garvey would be reunited with Allen on BBC Radio 5 Live, for a new Sunday evening programme. On 29 March 2017 Garvey, together with fellow broadcaster Fi Glover, started a weekly podcast series from BBC Radio 4, Fortunately: A frank look behind the scenes with broadcasters Jane Garvey and Fi Glover as guests from Radio, TV and podcasting share stories they probably shouldn‚Äôt. As of 2018, Garvey earns between ¬£150,000 and ¬£160,000, making her one of the top 25 highest paid presenters at the BBC. Breach of impartiality guidelines Garvey was found to have breached BBC guidelines on impartiality in the 1 October 2018 broadcast of Woman's Hour discussing the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the US Supreme Court. The main interviewee had compared the allegations against Kavanaugh with previous allegations against Judge Clarence Thomas, with a listener complaining about the bias of the interviewee selection and presenter. The BBC Executive Complaints Unit partially upheld the complaint and ruled that Garvey \\"gave the impression of sympathising with the viewpoint\\" of the biased interviewee, and \\"did not challenge the interviewee in a manner which would have ensured due impartiality\\". As a result of Garvey's breach of BBC guidelines, the Woman‚Äôs Hour team and production staff had to undertake training on impartiality. Personal life Garvey has described her childhood as \\"cosy, predictable and loving\\", and has said that the fact her maternal grandmother lived with her family while she was growing up contributed to her love of interviewing older women. She says she is a feminist. Garvey married the television presenter Adrian Chiles in September 1998 in Swansea. They lived in Shepherds Bush, west London and have two daughters, both born in Hammersmith and Fulham, London: Evelyn Katarina (born January 2000) and Sian Mary (born March 2003). Chiles is known to be a dedicated West Bromwich Albion fan; when asked in 2004 whether the football club would be promoted that season, Garvey commented: \\"I flaming hope not. Last time Albion got promoted, I gave birth nine months later.\\" In June 2008, Chiles and Garvey separated; and they were divorced in October 2009. In July 2019, Garvey received an honorary doctorate from the University of Birmingham.

He invented a method of applying the Czochralski method to produce extremely pure germanium single crystals used in making greatly improved transistors.Gordon Kidd Teal Papers #3820, The Texas Collection He, together with Morgan Sparks, invented a modification of the process that produced the configuration necessary for the fabrication of bipolar junction transistors. He is most remembered for developing the first silicon transistor while at Texas Instruments. Early life and education Teal was born in South Dallas, Texas to Olin Allison Teal and Azelia Kidd. His father had come to Texas in 1897 from Georgia. Gordon was valedictorian at the Bryan Street High School in Dallas, Texas, and graduated in 1924. Gordon earned his B.A. in Mathematics and Chemistry from Baylor University in 1927 and his master's and Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry from Brown University in 1928 and 1931, respectively. While at Brown, he began work in the laboratory of Professor Charles Kraus on the germanium, which was then believed to be useless. Bell Labs Teal joined Bell Labs in 1930, and would remain employed there for 22 years. During his time there, he continued to work with germanium and silicon. When William Shockley's group at Bell Labs invented the transistor in 1947 Teal realized that substantial improvements in the device would result if it was fabricated using a single crystal, rather than the polycrystalline material then being used, and created the grown junction single crystal technique. Texas Instruments In 1952 Dallas-based Texas Instruments had purchased a license to produce germanium transistors from Western Electric, the manufacturing arm of AT&T; and placed an ad in the New York Times for a director of research. Teal, becoming homesick for his native Dallas, responded and was hired by Patrick E. Haggerty. Teal started at TI as an Assistant Vice President on 1 January 1953, bringing with him all his expertise in growing semiconductor crystals. Haggerty had hired him to establish a team of scientists and engineers to keep TI at the leading edge of the new and rapidly expanding semiconductor industry. Teal's first assignment was to organize what became TI's Central Research Laboratories (CRL). Because of Teal's background, this new department was modeled after Bell Labs. Silicon transistor In April 1954 Teal's TI CRL team created the first commercial silicon transistor and tested it on 14 April 1954. On 10 May 1954 at the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE) National Conference on Airborne Electronics, in Dayton, Ohio, Teal revealed this achievement to the world when he announced, \\"Contrary to what my colleagues have told you about the bleak prospects for silicon transistors. I happen to have a few of them here in my pocket.\\" Teal also presented a paper, \\"Some Recent Developments in Silicon and Germanium Materials and Devices,\\" at this conference. Other achievements In 1957 Teal and the CRL developed a chemical reduction process for ultra-pure silicon. In 1958 a CRL employee, Jack Kilby, created the first integrated circuit. Other break-through developments include many advancements in infrared technology, and digital signal processing initially developed for the oil exploration industry, then for space and defense applications. During 1963 and 1964 Teal became the International Technical Director for TI, promoting TI's growth as an international company. He resided in England, France, and Italy and was most active in their scientific and industrial aspects. First Director of the Institute for Materials Research In 1965, Teal, taking a leave of absence from Texas Instruments, became the first Director of the National Bureau of Standards' Institute for Materials Research in Washington, D.C. After his two- year term, he returned to Texas Instruments and remained there until he retired in 1972. Retirement After retiring from Texas Instruments Teal continued to work as a consultant for Texas Instruments and the Department of Defense and participate in many scientific organizations. Personal life Teal was married to Lyda Louise Smith on March 7, 1931. The couple had three sons, Robert Carroll, Donald Fraser, and Stephen O‚ÄôBanion Teal. Awards and Honors *IEEE Medal of Honor (1968) *Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement (1967) Death and legacy Teal died on January 7, 2003.

It was a modification of the older Stridsvagn m/42, which was phased out of service in the early 1950s. Instead of scrapping the vehicles altogether, the chassis were used to build a new tank which could be used as a supplement to the newly bought stridsvagn 81. The turret of the strv 74 was completely new, with a 75 mm high-velocity gun based on an old anti-aircraft gun, engines and transmission were modified or changed from the strv m/42, broader tracks and a separate electrical motor for the turret rotation was introduced while retaining the manual control as a backup.  History  The Stridsvagn 74's development path stretches through the Stridsvagn m/40 and m/42 to the original 16,257 kg/16-ton Lago tank, manufactured by the Swedish firm Landsverk for the Hungarian Army.Forty, p. 217 The 74 was therefore in essence a modernized version of the World War II strv m/42 tank which was itself an attempt to bring Swedish-produced tanks up to the standard of the rest of war-torn Europe. It was most successful in this role. Produced in 1958, weighing and powered by two Scania-Vabis L/607 (170 hp/127 kW each) gasoline engines, the Stridsvagn 74 had a top speed of 45 kilometers per hour (28 miles per hour), and a range of 200 km/124.3 miles. With a crew of four, it mounted a 75mm/2.95in main gun and had two machine-guns in its updated turret, which was later further modified with a more sophisticated fire- control type system and an upgrading of the main armament to increase its velocity.  Use  Stridsvagn 74 was used in the Swedish Army armoured brigades as a replacement for the cancelled purchase of AMX-13 until it was replaced by strv 103. It was then used in independent corps tank companies, and even later relegated to the infantry support role in assault gun companies before being phased out of service in 1981 (strv 74 V) and 1984 (strv 74 H). The turrets were retained and later used as static gun pillboxes, which were phased out and demolished in the early 2000s. Its high silhouette and thin body along with the recoil of the gun made it rock when firing the gun at 3 and 9 o¬¥clock and it was sometimes referred as \\"Sansl√∂s\\" (Swedish for \\"Senseless\\") by its crew.  Versions  Strv 74 was available in two almost identical versions, strv 74 H and strv 74 V, the main difference being the transmissions which lead to slightly different layout of the interiors. The H version was based on the strv m/42 TH, and the V version was based on the strv m/42 TV.

History Gibeon, originally known by the name Khaxa- ts√ªs, received its name from Kido Witbooi, first Kaptein of the «ÄKhowesin, a subtribe of the Orlam. He arrived with his followers in about 1850, shortly after a Rhenish mission station was established here. Gibeon has been the home town of this group, subsequently also known as the Witbooi Nama, ever since. Buildings and structures Gibeon Railway Station is located in the village. The station is a stop on the TransNamib Railway. It is also home to a public sports stadium. The stadium was built in 1986 and fell into disrepair by 1993. In 2003, the Ministry of Sport of Namibia budgeted N$ 450,000 for repairs and awarded part of the public tender to Namibia Renovations, but the company disappeared days after winning the tender and their whereabouts could not be confirmed. As of December 2007, none of the repairs been completed. When the stadium was operational, it was known for its \\"excellent\\" gravel playing surface, which attracted teams from larger towns in southern Namibia.No renovations yet on Gibeon stadium 1 December 2007, The Namibian Geography Weather and climate Gibeon normally receives an annual average rainfall of , although in the 2010/2011 rainy season were measured.

It is an iron meteorite belonging to the chemical group IVAMeteoritical Bulletin Database: Gibeon Gibeon meteorites are made of an iron-nickel alloy, but contain also cobalt and phosphorus. The crystalline structure of this meteorite is a classic example of fine octahedrite and the Widmanst√§tten pattern aesthetically appreciated both by collectors and jewel designers. However, collecting meteorites or damaging them is illegal, as all meteorites found in Namibia are automatically protected as National Monuments. About 100‚Äì150 different fragments have been collected over time, and additional pieces are found occasionally. The largest collection of Gibeon meteorites is displayed on a fountain in Windhoek's Central Business District. Politics Gibeon is governed by a village council that has five seats.

An isolation manifold allows the connection between the cylinders to be closed in the case of a leak from one of the cylinders or its valve or regulator, conserving the gas in the other cylinder. Diving with two or more cylinders is often associated with technical diving. Several configurations are used, each with its own range of applications, advantages and disadvantages. Function Schematic diagram of scuba manifold systems Longer and deeper dives require a greater amount of breathing gas, in turn requiring higher filling pressure, a larger cylinder or multiple cylinders. A large diameter cylinder tends to move the diver's center of mass further from the centreline, making them unbalanced in the water, and a higher pressure cylinder has a similar effect, also reducing the buoyancy of the diver, due to the thicker metal required for strength. Cylinder length is also limited by ergonomic considerations in proportion to the height of the diver. A single cylinder also presents a critical single point of failure for the breathing gas supply. Multiple-tank configurations include downstream manifolded twins, with a single regulator, independent or separate doubles which are two cylinders clamped to a backplate, but without a manifold, side mount cylinders, or upstream manifolded twins, with two complete regulator sets, which may have an isolation valve. The function of a manifold is to connect the gas supplies of two back mounted cylinders (called doubles or twins), allowing the diver to breathe simultaneously from both. The manifold is a metal tube which is connected to the cylinder valves or directly to the cylinders, and may include an isolation valve or an outlet to connect a scuba regulator. On an upstream manifold the left and right cylinder valves allow the corresponding first stage regulator to be shut off, leaving the entire gas supply to be used through the remaining regulator. On an isolation manifold, the central valve, called the isolating valve, separates the tanks into two independent systems, each with its own first-stage and second-stage regulators, which can prevent an upstream failure in one half of the system from losing the entire gas supply. History Manifolded twin and triple cylinder sets have been used since the days of Cousteau and Gagnan's development of the open circuit regulator, as can be seen from early photographs of the equipment. These were downstream manifolds, which connected the cylinders together by linking the outlets of the cylinder valves, and had one outlet for a regulator. This arrangement allowed larger gas storage capacity using the limited range of cylinders available. Independent valving of the manifolded cylinders also allowed the gas supply to be monitored in the absence of submersible pressure gauges, by opening and closing the valves in a specific order, as the gas was used up. The need to remember the history of valve operation and the lack of facility to connect a redundant regulator made the use of independent twins the usual alternative. This also has limitations, even when the contents can be closely monitored by using submersible pressure gauges. In 1970 a group of divers including Tom Mount, Ike Ikehara and George Benjamin came up with the concept and had the first recorded dual outlet scuba valves prototyped. These allowed upstream connection of the cylinders, with a regulator on the valved outlet of each cylinder. Construction The manifold is usually machined from a high grade brass alloy, and chromium-plated for corrosion resistance and appearance. Brass is used because it is acceptably corrosion resistant, easy to machine, and suitable for oxygen service. The isolation valve uses similar materials, when present. Manifold lengths are available to connect different cylinder diameters, and centreline distance may be adjustable over a small range. Upstream manifolds Barrel seal scuba manifold Detail of scuba manifold showing barrel seal o-rings and left hand thread with lock nut Manifolds intended for use with sets where a regulator is provided for each cylinder are connected to the cylinder valves upstream of the cylinder valve seat, to a connecting port provided specifically for this purpose. Two styles of connection are available for this arrangement ‚Äì face seal, and barrel seal. Face seal connections are similar to the DIN regulator connection seal, and consist of an o-ring in a groove machined into the end of the manifold tube, which is clamped against the face of the valve port by a threaded component. Face seals are simple and rugged, but rely on tight connection for a reliable seal, and do not allow any adjustment for cylinder centre distance. Barrel seals use one or two O-rings in grooves around the end of the manifold tube, which seal against the bore of the valve port. They are usually screwed into the valve port with handed thread, and locked with a lock-nut. They are generally slightly less rugged than face seal manifolds, and more vulnerable to thread damage during assembly, but allow a small amount of cylinder centre distance adjustment, and provide a reliable seal even if not completely tight. Manifolds of this type are commonly supplied in sets comprising a manifold and compatible left and right side cylinder valves with a choice of neck thread specification. The working components for all three valves in the set are usually identical. Downstream manifolds Dr√§ger 200 bar cylinder manifold for 170mm diameter cylinders with DIN valvesDr√§ger cylinder valves with manifold and reserve lever on twin 7 litre cylinders Earlier manifolds were used to connect cylinders together downstream of the cylinder valve, using the DIN or yoke fittings on standard cylinder valves. These manifolds do not generally include an isolation valve, as the cylinder valves can be used to isolate the cylinders. However, they also do not provide for more than one regulator. Some of these earlier manifolds included a reserve valve at the connection point for the regulator. Direct manifolds A third style of manifold screwed directly into the cylinder neck thread, and provided a single valve which controlled flow from both cylinders to a single connector for a regulator. These manifolds could also include a reserve valve. From a gas management point of view they are identical to a single cylinder with the same capacity. Advantages Twin set connected by an isolating manifold Compared to a single cylinder of equivalent capacity: *Ergonomic ‚Äì Provides a more comfortable fit of cylinders with a lower profile and centre of mass closer to the diver's centreline, for better balance in the water. Compared to independent twins: *Operational simplicity ‚Äì the ability to breathe through an entire dive from a single regulator without the need to change second stages, except in an emergency or to change gases for decompression. *Only one submersible pressure gauge is necessary if the isolation valve is normally open. Isolation manifold compared to plain manifold: *Standard malfunction management ‚Äì in case of a regulator or manifold malfunction a standard procedure can be used to limit the gas loss. The diver can localize the malfunction and isolate it from the functioning system by closing the necessary valves. Disadvantages Compared to independent twins: *A manifold is a single point of failure for the gas supply, especially dangerous in overhead environments such as caves or wrecks. An isolating manifold localises the single point of failure to the isolating valve itself. *An upstream manifolded set must be emptied to split if needed as singles. Compared to a single large cylinder: *The manifold, valves and second cylinder are an additional cost, both for capital outlay and maintenance. *The twin set is usually heavier than the equivalent single. Compared to side-mount: *The manifold and valves are vulnerable to damage by impact with the overhead, and to snagging. *The valves are difficult to reach for many divers, reducing the effectiveness of isolation procedures. Management of the manifold in gas supply emergencies Regulator malfunction If a regulator malfunctions on a set with an upstream manifold, the diver closes the relevant cylinder valve and switches to the other regulator. The entire remaining gas supply is available for the rest of the dive. Cylinder connection leak Cylinder to manifold connection malfunction, though rare, can result in an extremely violent gas loss. On a set with an isolation manifold, the diver closes the isolating valve to preserve the gas in the cylinder which is not leaking, then uses the leaking cylinder while gas remains, and switches to the intact side cylinder when the leaky one is empty. At least half of the remaining gas volume is available for the remainder of the dive. If there is no isolation valve the entire gas supply may be lost.

Biography John Dalzell was born in New York City. He moved with his parents, Samuel Dalzell and Mary McDonnell Dalzell to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1847. He attended the common schools and the Western University of Pennsylvania in Pittsburgh. He graduated from Yale College, where he was a member of Scroll and Key, with the class of 1865. He studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1867 and commenced practice in Pittsburgh. Dalzell was elected as a Republican to the Fiftieth Congress in 1886 and to the twelve succeeding Congresses. He served as chairman of the United States House Committee on Pacific Railroads during the Fifty-first Congress, and the United States House Committee on Rules during the Sixty- first Congress. Dalzell was also a member of the House Committee on Ways and Means from 1891 to 1913. He ran for the U.S. Senate in 1898 and 1900 but was defeated both times by Matthew S. Quay. In 1902 he lost his bid for the Speakership of the House of Representatives to Joseph G. Cannon. Dalzell was a delegate to the Republican National Conventions in 1904 and 1908, and served as a Regent of the Smithsonian Institution from 1906 to 1913. After the death of Pennsylvania representative Henry H. Bingham in March 1912, Dalzell became the longest continuously-serving member of the House of Representatives, or the \\"Father of the House.\\" He was defeated for renomination later in 1912 and left Congress in March 1913. As cited in \\"The Congressional Career of John Dalzell with Special Emphasis Upon His Tariff Views\\" by Kathryn E. Beazell, A.B.,\\" John Dalzell worked closely with President Theodore Roosevelt. \\"It was said that because of President Roosevelt's outspoken manner, scores of Congressmen stayed away from the White House. But during the seven years that Mr. Roosevelt occupied the White House, he had no more frequent or welcome visitor than Mr. Dalzell. Oftentimes, when someone wanted favor from Mr. Roosevelt, Mr. Dalzell was asked to intercede. It was also said that with Presidents Harrison and McKinley, Mr. Dalzell was in close and constant touch, and that many of their ideas were brought before the House by Mr. Dalzell.\\" At one point, President Theodore Roosevelt was asked about one particular matter, and responded: \\"Is Mr. Dalzell in favor of this improvement?\\" \\"He is, Mr. President,\\" replied the spokesman. \\"Gentlemen,\\" said the President, \\"I'll say this to you. I would do more for John Dalzell than I would for any other man on the floor of the House.\\" Personal life Embassy of Tajikistan in Dalzell's former residence in Washington, D.C. He married Mary Louise Duff, September 26, 1867. She was the daughter of Peter Duff (February 16, 1802 ‚Äì September 13, 1869), the founder of Duff's Business Institute in Pittsburgh, (now Everest Institute). John and Mary Dalzell had five children: William Sage Dalzell (August 17, 1868 ‚Äì September 27, 1934), Elizabeth Marter Dalzell (March 4, 1870 ‚Äì 1961), Samuel Dalzell (April 22, 1873 ‚Äì 1958), John Dalzell Jr (August 1, 1875 ‚Äì May 6, 1877) and Robert Duff Dalzell (August 27, 1882 ‚Äì November 30, 1967). Elizabeth Marter Dalzell married Col. George M. Dunn, one of Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders. During John Dalzell's political career, his wife Mary Louise was a prominent hostess active in the Washington political scene. Although women did not have the vote at that time, still she was politically influential. To briefly quote a passage describing this from vol 2, p 25 of Kitzmiller's The Family Encyclopedia: \\"... his friends persuaded him, somewhat against his will, to go to Congress. In this project they were aided and abetted by his wife .... (who) was exceptionally well-fitted to be the helpmate of a congressman.

Subtitled ‚Äúradio‚Äôs distinguished series to man‚Äôs imagination,‚Äù it was a revival of the earlier Columbia Experimental Laboratory (1931), Columbia Experimental Dramatic Laboratory (1932) and Columbia Workshop broadcasts by CBS from 1936 to 1943, and used some of the same writers and directors employed on the earlier series. The CBS Radio Workshop was one of American network radio's last attempts to hold on to, and perhaps recapture, some of the demographics they had lost to television in the post-World War II era. The premiere broadcast was a two-part adaptation of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, introduced and narrated by Huxley. It took a unique approach to sound effects, as described in a Time (February 6, 1956) review that week: :It took three radio sound men, a control-room engineer and five hours of hard work to create the sound that was heard for less than 30 seconds on the air. The sound consisted of a ticking metronome, tom-tom beats, bubbling water, air hose, cow moo, boing! (two types), oscillator, dripping water (two types) and three kinds of wine glasses clicking against each other. Judiciously blended and recorded on tape, the effect was still not quite right. Then the tape was played backward with a little echo added. That did it. The sound depicted the manufacturing of babies in the radio version of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World.Time, February 6, 1956 Music for the series was composed by Bernard Herrmann, Jerry Goldsmith, Amerigo Moreno, Ray Noble and Leith Stevens. Writers adapted to the series included John Cheever, Robert A. Heinlein, Sinclair Lewis, H. L.

The most common types of elimination races are the miss and out and the win and out. In 2015 at the 2015 UEC European Track Championships it was for the first time contested as a full event at an international championship. Miss and out The miss and out, or devil take the hindmost, is a race run for individual competitors or, more rarely, for teams of two relaying each other as in the madison. At the end of every lap or every set number of laps the last rider to cross the line is eliminated from the race. When just a handful of riders remain, they sprint for the finish. Tactically, the real racing in a \\"devil\\" happens at the back of the field. With riders at the front riding steadily and those behind moving up on the elimination laps to find a safe spot, the race favours riders with nerve and track-craft. Crashes are more common than in other races, especially among inexperienced riders. Win and out The win and out is similar to the miss and out, however, rather than the last rider being eliminated the first rider to cross the line is removed from the race. The first rider removed wins first place, the second rider removed wins second place, and so on.

It features Peter, an African American boy, who explores his neighborhood after the season‚Äôs first snowfall. Keats received the 1963 Caldecott Medal for his collage artwork, which made The Snowy Day the first picture book with an African American protagonist to win a major children‚Äôs award.  Plot  Peter, The Snowy Day's protagonist, wakes up to the season‚Äôs first snowfall. In his bright red snowsuit, he goes outside and makes footprints and trails through the snow. Peter is too young to join a snowball fight with older kids, so he makes a snowman and snow angels and slides down a hill. He returns home with a snowball stashed in his pocket. Before he goes to bed, Peter is sad to discover the snowball has melted. The next day, he wakes up to tons more falling snow. With a friend, he ventures outside again.  About the author  Keats, born Jacob (Jack) Ezra Katz, grew up in a poor Jewish family with immigrant parents in Brooklyn, New York. Following his service in World War II, he changed his last name from Katz to Keats to avoid anti-semitism and to find work in the book publishing industry. Keats‚Äôs experience living in tenement housing surrounded by children of different cultures and ethnicities can be seen in his books. For example, he and co-author, Pat Cherr, featured minority children in their first work, My Dog is Lost! However, none of Keats's more than 30 illustration jobs featured black children prior to The Snowy Day. If he wrote and illustrated his own book, Keats always knew the hero would be African American.  History of The Snowy Day  Two years after My Dog is Lost! was published, Keats began working on his first solo project. He was inspired by a set of photographs of an African American boy from a 1940 edition of Life magazine that had hung in his studio for over two decades. Keats noted the storyline came from his memories of snowy days in his Brooklyn childhood. Similar to the haiku poetry in which he found inspiration, Keats applied simple and straightforward text to The Snowy Day. Words were chosen to capture a mood and were further enhanced by colorful settings. Asian art influences are seen throughout the story, giving readers a wintry theatrical backdrop across the width of two book pages. The Snowy Day's illustrations rely on a combination of collaged decorative paper, fabric and cloth. Keats created a homemade snowflake stamp and spattered India ink with a toothbrush to add embellishments. While he wasn't trying to make a statement about race, The Snowy Day was one of the first books to feature a non-caricatured African American protagonist. His groundbreaking illustrations and simple story earned him the Caldecott Medal in 1963. His character, Peter, went on to appear in Whistle for Willie (1964), Peter's Chair (1967), A Letter to Amy (1968), Goggles! (1969), Caldecott Honor Medal book, Hi, Cat! (1970), and Pet Show! (1972). In later works that featured Peter, Keats added gouache, a watercolor and gum hybrid that resulted in an oily glaze. The simplicity that characterized The Snowy Day gave way to complex artwork, as Keats' toolkit grew to encompass marbled paper, acrylic and watercolor paints, inks and old photographs. The works are emotionally evocative and rely on painting techniques that include cubism and abstraction. Impact Keats aimed to capture the wonder of a child‚Äôs first snowfall. While some critics questioned whether or not Keats‚Äì‚Äìa white Jewish man‚Äì‚Äìcould rightfully tell the story of an African American child, most early reviews of the book focus on its collage illustrations instead of the protagonist‚Äôs race. However, as the Civil Rights Movement progressed, The Snowy Day became the subject of more scrutiny. One common criticism revolved around Peter‚Äôs lack of authentic African American culture and experiences. Nancy Larrick's 1965 article ‚ÄúThe All-White World of Children‚Äôs Books‚Äù thought Peter‚Äôs mother resembled a mammy stereotype. Being at the center of race-based objections upset the author greatly. Keats maintained his character was based on his own mother, and the author, who was no stranger to discrimination himself, was puzzled by the idea of assigning a race to children playing in the snow. Even though The Snowy Day was criticized for tokenism, Keats portrayed African American children with previously unseen positivity. Prior to The Snowy Day, the few children's books that featured African American children relied on negative stereotypes. Fan letters for Keats' book came from numerous African American activists, educators, and children who included their own collage artwork. One teacher told Keats that, for the first time, she watched as children selected brown crayons for their self-portraits. By the 1980s, critics began to recognize how far The Snowy Day had come from the stereotypical depictions in Little Black Sambo. A 50th anniversary edition of the book was published in 2011 and featured photos of the child who inspired Peter and a letter from Langston Hughes. Several contemporary honors and memorials also celebrate his vision of the universal human spirit. Adaptations The Snowy Day was adapted as an animated preschool Christmas special released on Amazon Prime on November 25, 2016. The special is narrated by Laurence Fishburne and includes the voices of Regina King and Angela Bassett. In it, an original song, \\"Snowy Day,\\" was performed by Boyz II Men. In 2017, this adaptation was nominated for five Daytime Emmy Awards, and won two. The book inspired Andrea Davis Pinkney‚Äôs A Poem for Peter: The Story of Ezra Jack Keats and the Creation of The Snowy Day in 2016. The Snowy Day has been translated into at least 10 languages.  Honors and memorials  The Ezra Jack Keats Foundation created the Ezra Jack Keats New Writer Award in 1985, and the Ezra Jack Keats New Illustrator Award was established in 2001. The New York Public Library named The Snowy Day as one of its Books of the Century. Peter and his dog, Willie, are memorialized in a bronze statue in Imagination Playground in New York City. In 2017, the United States Postal Service honored The Snowy Day and Keats with four illustrations of Peter playing in the snow on its Forever Stamp.

Elastic scattering of WIMPs from argon nuclei is measurable by observing free electrons from ionization and photons from scintillation, which are produced by the recoiling nucleus interacting with neighbouring atoms. The ionization and scintillation signals can be measured with dedicated readout techniques, which constitute a fundamental part of the detector. In order to get a high enough target mass the noble gas argon is used in the liquid phase as target material. Since the boiling point of argon is at 87 K at normal pressure, the operation of the detector requires a cryogenic system. Experimental goals The ArDM detector aims at directly detecting signals from WIMPs via elastic scattering from argon nuclei. During the scattering, a certain recoil energy - typically lying between 1 keV and 100 keV - is transferred from the WIMP to the argon nucleus. It is not known how frequently a signal from WIMP-argon interaction can be expected. This rate depends on the underlying model describing the properties of the WIMP. One of the most popular candidates for a WIMP is the Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP) or neutralino from supersymmetric theories. Its cross section with nucleons presumably lies between 10‚àí12 pb and 10‚àí6 pb, making WIMP-nucleon interactions a rare event. The total event rate can be increased by optimizing the target properties, such as increasing the target mass. The ArDM detector is planned to contain approximately one ton of liquid argon. This target mass corresponds to an event rate of approximately 100 events per day at a cross section of 10‚àí6 pb or 0.01 events per day at 10‚àí10 pb. Small event rates require a powerful background rejection. An important background comes from the presence of the unstable 39Ar isotope in natural argon liquefied from the atmosphere. 39Ar undergoes beta decay with a halflife of 269 years and an endpoint of the beta spectrum at 565 keV. The ratio of ionization over scintillation from electron and gamma interactions is different than WIMP scattering produces. The 39Ar background is therefore well distinguishable, with a precise determination of the ionization/scintillation ratio. As an alternative, the use of depleted argon from underground wells is being considered. Neutrons emitted by detector components and by materials surrounding the detector interact with argon in the same way as WIMPs. The neutron background is therefore nearly indistinguishable and has to be reduced as well as possible, as for example by carefully choosing the detector materials. Furthermore, an estimation or measurement of the remaining neutron flux is necessary. The detector is planned to be run underground in order to avoid backgrounds induced by cosmic rays. Construction status The ArDM detector was assembled and tested at CERN in 2006. Above ground studies of the equipment and detector performance were performed before it was moved underground in 2012 in the Canfranc Underground Laboratory in Spain. It was filled with was commissioned and tested at room temperature. During the April 2013 run underground, the light yield was improved compared to surface conditions. Future cold argon gas runs are planned as well as continued detector development. Liquid argon results are planned for 2014. Beyond the one-ton version, the detector size can be increased without fundamentally changing its technology. A ten-ton liquid argon detector is a thinkable expansion possibility for ArDM. Current experiments for Dark Matter detection at a mass scale of 1 kg to 100 kg with negative results demonstrate the necessity of ton-scale experiments.  Results and Future Directions  Design of DarkSide-50 liquid argon dewar containing the two-phase TPC. Despite studying inherently 'dark' matter, the future seems bright for dark matter detector development. The \\"Dark Side Program\\" is a consortium that has conducted and continues to develop new experiments based on condensed atmospheric argon (LAr), instead of xenon, liquid. One recent Dark Side apparatus, the Dark Side-50 (DS-50), employs a method known as \\"two-phase liquid argon time projection chambers (LAr TPCs),\\" which allows for three-dimensional determination of collision event positions created by the electrolumnescence created by argon collisions with dark matter particles. The Dark Side program released its first results on its findings in 2015, so far being the most sensitive results for argon-based dark matter detection. LAr-based methods used for future apparatuses present an alternative to xenon-based detectors and could potentially lead to new, more sensitive multi-ton detectors in the near future.

The youngest child of Lord Pierre Br√ªlart de Berni and Dame Marie Cauchon de Sillery, Noel was named for the day of his birth, December 25, 1577. He joined the military-religious order of the Knights of Malta at a young age and distinguished himself by his service on that island. In 1607, while on leave, he was presented at court in Paris. In 1614 he was made Ambassador to the Spanish court and in 1622, to Rome. It was in Rome that he first conceived of the idea of renouncing worldly goods and joining the priesthood. He returned to Paris in 1624, where he lived a life of luxury that, for all the honours and riches he enjoyed, failed to satisfy him. In 1626, moved by the words of St. Vincent de Paul, he vowed to reform his life, dedicating his considerable energy, talents and fortune to the task of helping others. He began to give his money in support of a wide variety of charitable causes and foundations. In 1632, he began to prepare in earnest for holy orders and divested himself of his palatial property in Paris. He successfully petitioned the Pope for the special dispensation that was required for a Knight of Malta to leave the order and become a priest. In 1632, he gave twelve thousand pounds to fund the foundation of a mission in New France (Canada), which would eventually be named Sillery, in remembrance of his generosity. He became a priest in 1634. The mission, at that time called St. Joseph Mission, was built in 1638. The former city of Sillery, Qu√©bec, was named for him. Located just west of old Quebec City, Sillery was among the many outlying municipalities amalgamated into an expanded Quebec City on January 1, 2002. Its former territory now forms part of the borough of Sainte- Foy‚ÄìSillery‚ÄìCap-Rouge. The name Sillery is still used locally for the picturesque neighbourhood. A monument to No√´l Brulart de Sillery, consisting of a pedestal and bust, stands on Avenue Chanoine-Morel next to the Community Centre named after him. Erected in 1956, the monument was created by artist Ren√© Thibault, based on a concept by architect √âdouard Fiset.

Riccia borders the following municipalities: Castelpagano, Castelvetere in Val Fortore, Cercemaggiore, Colle Sannita, Gambatesa, Jelsi, Pietracatella, Tufara. History The first people who lived there came with Oscans. By the time of the arrival of the Samnites (4th century BC) the area was well developed and prosperous, as noted by objects found in the excavations of the area. During the Social War (90-88 BC) the area was destroyed and the Romans colonized the Sannio area. The colonists included Roman troops from Ariccia, near Rome. They named the place \\"Ariccia\\" which then was changed to \\"Saricia\\", then to \\"Ricia\\" and finally, \\"Riccia\\". In the second half of the 6th century, Riccia came under the rule of the Lombard Duke of Benevento. In the 13th century, Riccia became part of the Monastery St. Pietro e Severo (St. Peter and St. Xavier), located in the nearby town of Torremaggiore. This ecclesiastical feudalism lasted throughout the Hohenstaufen period. In 1238, Frederick II linked the properties of the castle of Riccia with that at the town of St. Severo, and exchanged it for the monastery at Torremaggiore. This exchange was confirmed in 1266 by King Charles of Anjou, who conceded Riccia to the famous jurist Bartolomeo De Capua, whose family ruled Riccia until 1792. In May 1397, Count Andrea De Capua brought Costanza Chiaramonte, the former queen of Naples, to Riccia. Three years earlier, after the fortunes of her family had precipitously fallen, her marriage to King Ladislaus of Naples was annulled at Gaeta. She remained in Riccia until her death in 1422; she is buried in the Church of Santa Maria delle Grazie (also called Church of St. Stefano Corumano). In 1500, Bartolomeo II De Capua built an elegant castle in Riccia and also restored the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Tuscan style, where five feudal lords and their ladies are buried. In the beginning of this feudal period, the rulers of Riccia, the noble De Capua family, were viewed as fair and generous with the peasants. But over the years the peasants endured many hardships. Finally they rebelled, releasing enough hate and fury to burn down the castle in 1799. Today only a few ruins of the castle with its medieval watchtower may still be seen in the historical quarter of Riccia. The noble family De Capua became extinct with Bartolomeo VI in 1792. During World War II, 84 townspeople of Riccia were among the dead and wounded, but it was not bombed. After the war, because of the scarcity of work locally, Riccia had a strong outflow of immigration to northern Europe (France, Switzerland, Belgium Germany) and to Latin America (Venezuela and Argentina). However, in recent years, efforts by the town have increased the prosperity. By decree of the President of the Republic, dated 15 October 1986, Riccia earned the title of \\"City\\".

Translated by Shirley Kubo and Leah Ginsberg, the English version was published in paperback by TokyoPop in 2003 and 2004. It was one of Tokyopop's first \\"Mature\\" rated series, and was sold in shrink wrap on US store shelves. Happy Mania is a good example of Josei manga, a genre of manga aimed at women over 20 and deals more with the adult aspect of being a woman in contemporary Japan. Plot Shigeta, a young woman of 24, spends her days working at Tanaka Books and fretting over her love-life; or, more accurately, the lack thereof. The thing is, though, the biggest obstacle between Shigeta and a satisfying relationship seems to be Shigeta herself. When it comes to men, the poor girl has exceedingly poor judgement, exacerbated by her even poorer self-esteem. Volume 1 Kayoko Shigeta is spotted digging through a love horoscope while working at Tanaka Books. Been convinced that her relationship karma is at its peak, Shigeta develops an immediately crush on a cute guy customer. After getting his number, she calls the guy and immediately sleeps with him. Unfortunately, this guy only wants sex not a girlfriend. Then Shigeta tries to steal the boyfriend of Yuko Tanabe, the new hire at the book store. Being chased out of the bookstore by furious Yuko, Shigeta runs into a car. After being released from the hospital, Fuku, Shigeta's gorgeous roommate, takes her to a club. There, Shigeta falls for the DJ Tokieda. Being self-convinced that Tokieda is in love with her, Shigeta stops showing up for work and eventually loses her job at the bookstore. Even after spotting a naked woman in his bed, Shigeta still believes that she and Toki will get married soon. However, Tokieda prefers free love so she rejects him. Volume 2 Kayoko starts a new job at a make-up store. Meanwhile, Fuku plans to move-out and to marry her fianc√© Matsu. However, this marriage is called-off when Fuku finds out that Matsu is cheating on her with Yumi. Shigeta's mom drags her to a temple to ask for a boyfriend. There she runs into Sakai, her high-school classmate. However, Sakai turns out to be a stalker. Shigeta has to keep on hiding away from him but Sakai won't leave her alone. She starts to receive take-out food she didn't order and calls from guys who find her number in phone booths. Sakai eventually kidnaps her. Takahashi rescues her from Sakai and confesses his love. Just as Shigeta starts to fall for Takahashi, he goes to the U.S. to study. Shigeta is alone again. Volume 3 Shigeta doesn't like her long-distance relationship with Takahashi. Fuku is planning to marry a new guy Hideki and never comes home. At a ceramics exhibit, Shigeta is attracted to the handsome potter Goro Kishiwada. To seduce him, she quits the make-up shop to become an apprentice at Kishiwada's studio. At the studio, she finds him having sex with Midori, the daughter of the master. Just as Shigeta is thinking of how to sleep with Kishiwada, Takahashi shows up at her front door. Later, Midori and Kishiwada elope together. However, Kishiwada tells Shigeta that he was actually tricked by Midori who used him to be with another man. Kishiwada eventually leaves for China. At the end, Shigeta is alone again. Main characters Kayoko Shigeta The story's main character, Kayoko is an attractive but insecure 24-year-old girl who is quick to fall for potential suitors and even quicker to draw conclusions about those who she perceives as threatening to her love life. Takahashi a worker at the same bookstore as Kayoko in volume 1, Takahashi is a student at Tokyo University and is in love with Kayoko despite her constant exploits with other men. Fukunaga (aka Fuku) is Shigeta's roommate and best friend. Fuku is a slightly older and significantly more grounded female character in the story who's relative success with men and more laid back demeanor serve as useful contrasts to Kayoko. Yuko Tanabe another worker at the bookstore, Yuko is a plain looking girl who Kayoko is angered by when she finds out that Yuko has a boyfriend. Kayoko jealously seduces Yuko's boyfriend and has sex with him in a car but is then disappointed to find out that he is not, in fact, in love with her. Tokiedo a hip DJ that Kayoko meets in a club, Toki is the most significant crush that Kayoko has in volume 1. After things do not work out with him, Kayoko temporarily renounces boys and focuses on work. Sakai Sakai is the son of a cult leader who Kayoko meets in her hometown when visiting her mother to borrow money. He stalks her after her interest in him wanes leading to his kidnap and near-rape of her, before Takahashi saves her. Violet Violet is an attractive girl who is a student with Takahashi. When Kayoko sees that Violet is interested in Takahashi, she too realizes his worth as a suitor and gets together with him. Goro Kishiwada Kishiwada is another of Kayoko's lovers. An accomplished pottery artist, Kishiwada is the reason that Kayoko takes a job as an apprentice to a pottery teacher. Miss Midori A rumored nymphomaniac, Miss Midori is Kishiwada's lover, and runs away with him towards the end of volume 3. TV A 12-episode TV series based on the manga under the same title was directed by Kinoshita (Êú®‰∏ãÈ´òÁî∑) and Hirano (Âπ≥ÈáéÁúû). Starring Fujiwara Norika (Ëó§ÂéüÁ¥ÄÈ¶ô), it was first aired from 8 July to 23 September 1998. The theme song was Paradise by Southern All Stars.

He was the President of the Weizmann Institute of Science from 1988 to 2001.  Biography  Haim Harari was born in Jerusalem in Mandatory Palestine. His family has lived in the area which is now Israel for five generations. His parents were Knesset member Yizhar Harari and Dina Neumann. Harari received his M.Sc. and Ph.D. in Physics from Hebrew University of Jerusalem.  Academic career  In 1967, after completing his Ph.D, he became the youngest professor ever at the Weizmann Institute. He has been the founder and first chairman of the Board (1999-2015) of the Davidson Institute of Science Education at the Weizmann Institute and he is currently Chair of the Management Committee of the Weizmann Global Endowment Management Trust in New York. In 1979 he was elected as Chairman of the Planning and Budgeting Committee (PBC)Planning and Budgeting Committee (PBC) (Hebrew: ◊î◊ï◊ï◊¢◊ì◊î ◊ú◊™◊õ◊†◊ï◊ü ◊ï◊ú◊™◊ß◊¶◊ï◊ë, ◊ï◊™\\"◊™) of the Council of Higher Education, serving two terms until 1985. During his tenure as chairman of the PBC, he established the Israel Inter-University Computation Center (IUCC) and laid the foundations for the university computer network in Israel. He was the President, from 1988 to 2001, of the Weizmann Institute of Science. During his presidency, the Weizmann Institute, entirely dedicated to basic research, became one of the leading royalty earning academic research organizations in the world. Harari has made major contributions to three different fields: particle physics research on the international scene, science education in the Israeli school system and science administration and policy making. Harari coined the name of the top and bottom quarks, predicted in 1973 by Kobayashi and Maskawa, and made the first complete statement of the standard six quarks and six leptons model of particle physics (at the Stanford 1975 Lepton-Photon Conference). He also proposed the Rishon Model, a model for a substructure of quarks and leptons, currently believed to be the most fundamental particles in nature. There is no experimental evidence yet for such substructure. He is the co- founder (1974) of Perach,The Perach Tutorial Project - website a national tutoring and mentoring project in which over 20,000 Israeli undergraduates receive a tuition fellowship in return for devoting four hours per week to a child from an underprivileged socioeconomic background.The Early History of Perach He also initiated and established in Tel Aviv (1988) a science teaching center \\"HEMDA\\", in which high school students perform all their physics studies in advanced laboratories and with highly qualified teachers, instead of pursuing the same in their own schools. Harari has been chairman of both projects, since their founding, until recently.

The lake was given its present name in 1865, when the town was renamed from Bergen Iron Works to Bricksburg. Lake Carasaljo is named after the three daughters of the owner of the Bergen Iron Works, Joseph Woolston Brick, for whom Brick Township, New Jersey is named. His daughters were named Caroline (nicknamed 'Carrie'), Sarah ('Sally') and Josephine ('Jo'). Brick's wife Manetta lent her name to its sister lake, which was created when the Watering Place Branch was dammed in 1816. Local legend is that the three girls drowned in the lake, which was subsequently named after them. Historical documents show the three girls were alive when the lake was named. Another man-made lake, Lake Shenandoah, is also found along the same branch of the Metedeconk River and is part of the Ocean County, New Jersey Department of Parks and Recreation. Georgian Court University, which is on the grounds of what was once an estate of George Jay Gould, is on the northern shore of the lake. The lake is bounded on the north side by North Lake Drive, on the south by South Lake Drive, and on the east by U.S. Route 9 (also known as River Road). It is separated from Lake Manetta by the Central Avenue Bridge.

Each Yankees Classics episode is hosted by Yankees radio announcer John Sterling, who discusses the game's impact on Yankees history at the beginning and end of the telecast.http://web.yesnetwork.com/announcers/bio.jsp?id=jsterling Network broadcast library When it debuted in 2002 as one of the first series to air on YES, Yankees Classics consisted entirely of regular season games from the team's local broadcasts, via WPIX, MSG Network, and WNYW. In 2003, YES acquired rights to rebroadcast playoff games that aired nationally on Fox. In 2007, YES and Major League Baseball acquired rights to games that aired on ABC as part of MLB's then-TV deal with ESPN, including Bobby Murcer's five runs batted in during the game the night of Thurman Munson's funeral. Other games included in this transaction are Game 5 of the 1976 ALCS and Game 6 of the 1977 World Series. In 2008, YES and MLB gained the rights to NBC's telecasts of 1978 and 1999 World Series games. Graphics and announcers used The logos of the original broadcasters originally were covered by the YES Network logo; eventually, the logos were then replaced by the Yankees logo. The announcers used were a combination of the Yankees radio announcers and national broadcasters used during the telecast, with the audio feed constantly changing during the game from one announcing team to the other, possibly to prevent advertisements or station promos to be heard, or to include Yankee broadcasters Sterling and Michael Kay giving calls of a Yankee home run, or of Sterling's signature victory closing: \\"Ballgame over! Yankees win! The-e-e-e Yankees win!\\" Regular season games since YES' launch in 2002 simply take the TV broadcast, with most out-of-date sponsor plugs removed. Typically scheduled air dates A specific Yankees Classic often is shown on its anniversary or on a day when the current team is playing the same opponent. (For example, on October 2, or when the Yankees are scheduled to play the Boston Red Sox, the 1978 playoff game for the American League Eastern Division title, featuring the improbable home run by Bucky Dent, often is broadcast.) Other possibilities include honoring a Yankee on his birthday by showing a Yankees Classics in which he was the game's hero. (For example, on June 26, Derek Jeter's birthday, YES may broadcast Game 4 of the 2001 World Series, which Jeter won with an extra-inning home run; this was his \\"Mr. November\\" game.)http://www.yankeenumbers.com/classicsview.asp?cls_ID=38 Games featuring individual Yankee achievements, such as Ron Guidry's 18-strikeout game, no- hitters, and David Cone's 1999 perfect game often are shown, for example, to coincide with programs about Yankee pitchers. As with other re-broadcast games, some innings are skipped due to time restrictions. Criticism Yankees Classics has been criticized for showing recent games, including those from the current MLB season, when there are many games which haven't been seen in decades. For example, although the memorable 1978 playoff game against Boston has frequently aired,http://www.yankeenumbers.com/classicsview.asp?cls_ID=26 YES has not shown any games from the 1978 ALCS. Also there have thus far been no shows featuring any of the games from the 1977 ALCS, 1981 ALDS or 1981 ALCS. Curiously, outside of Dave Righetti's July 4, 1983, no hit game, there have been no broadcasts of any Yankees games from the 1980s.http://www.yankeenumbers.com/classics.asp It is not clear why this is but some have speculated that complete tapes of the games no longer exist or are technically unsuitable for broadcast. It has also been observed that while episodes of the biographical program Yankeeography make reference to losing efforts in the careers of its subjects, the Yankee Classics series has yet to air anything but games won by the team. This meant that the game in which Derek Jeter surpassed Lou Gehrig's record for most hits as a Yankee, would never be aired as the Yankees lost the game to the Baltimore Orioles. However, this game was later aired on Yankees Classics, only edited until the point where Jeter got the hit.https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/12/sports/baseball/12yankees.html References Classics YES Network original programming 2002 American television series debuts ","title":"Yankees Classics"},{"id":"6457274","text":"Thomas Harrington was the Associate Deputy Director of the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation which is the number three position in the bureau.

He also owned the Indianapolis Hoosiers in the late 1880s, followed by ownership of the Cincinnati Reds for a decade. Under Brush's leadership, the Giants were revived as a franchise, following a decline during the 1890s. The team won four National League championships and one World Series during his tenure as principal owner. Brush was also a leader in the formation of the rules that govern the modern World Series. He was one of 11 executives honored by the Baseball Hall of Fame in the Honor Rolls of Baseball in 1946. Biography Early years Born in Clintonville, New York, Brush was orphaned at age 4 and was raised by his grandfather until he left to enter business college at age 17. During the Civil War he enlisted in the First New York Artillery in 1863, and after the war's end he went into business running clothing stores in Albany, Troy and Lockport, New York. He moved to Indianapolis in 1875, eventually opening a department store, and became involved in local baseball as a means of promoting his store. He built a ballpark in 1882, and it became home to the Indianapolis Hoosiers of the American Association for their only major league season in 1884; they played in the Western League before that circuit folded after the 1885 campaign. Franchise ownerships When the National League (NL) put the St. Louis Maroons franchise up for sale after the 1886 season, Brush bought it and relocated the team to Indianapolis. The team was renamed as the Indianapolis Hoosiers, and competed in the NL for three seasons (1887‚Äì1889). Brush renovated his ballpark, adding a special celebrity box which attracted such figures as President Benjamin Harrison, poet James Whitcomb Riley, and future novelist Booth Tarkington. In 1888, he offered a tryout to Bud Fowler, but ultimately decided not to challenge the sport's color line. Brush also devised a salary scale system which was designed to curtail player salaries, a move which helped contribute to the breakaway Players' League in 1890. When the Indianapolis team folded after the 1889 season, Brush was compensated with $67,000 and a share of the New York Giants franchise, along with a promise of the next available team; he quickly acquired the Cincinnati Reds club after its financial collapse during the three-league competition of 1890. Instead of relocating, he kept the team in Cincinnati, and survived a challenge from a short-lived American Association competitor, the Cincinnati Kelly's Killers. Brush frequently was at odds with sportswriter Ban Johnson of the city's Commercial Gazette, and in an attempt to reduce the writer's local influence he helped Johnson become president of the new Western League‚Äîa move which eventually backfired when the league achieved major status as the American League (AL) in 1901, with Johnson remaining as president. Brush in 1912, confined to an \\"invalid's chair\\" due to progressive ataxia and rheumatism As chairman of the NL's executive committee, Brush took a lead role in combating the AL, joining with Giants majority owner Andrew Freedman to sabotage the AL's Baltimore club by offering the managing jobs of the New York and Cincinnati teams to John McGraw and Joe Kelley respectively; Baltimore was forced to relocate to New York after 1902, eventually becoming the New York Yankees. The acrimony also contributed to controversy in the selection of a new NL president in 1902, as the Giants supported incumbent president Nicholas Young against Albert Spalding, who favored better relations with the AL; in the deadlock, both candidates were forced to withdraw, with Harry Pulliam being selected as a compromise choice. In August 1902, Brush sold his interest in the Reds to a group headed by August \\"Garry\\" Herrmann, for $180,000. At the end of September, Freedman left baseball, with Brush taking over as majority owner and team president of the Giants. When the Giants won the 1904 NL pennant, Brush refused to allow the team to meet Boston's defending champions (then known as the Boston Americans) in a 1904 World Series, due to his animosity toward Johnson; a permanent agreement between the leagues was eventually made after meeting some of Brush's conditions, and the Giants won the 1905 World Series against the Philadelphia Athletics. Later years The John T. Brush Stairway, one of only two structures that survive from the Polo Grounds era Brush's health deteriorated quickly after becoming majority owner in 1902, as he suffered from locomotor ataxia, a nervous system affliction, as well as rheumatism. The Giants won another pennant in 1911, losing that season's World Series, the same year in which he oversaw the reconstruction of the Polo Grounds. After the team repeated as NL champions the following season, Brush attended games of the 1912 World Series. The Giants were again defeated, and his failing health was apparent, particularly in the aftermath of an auto accident that September 11 in which his car was struck by a truck and overturned, causing two broken ribs. After the Series he left by train to recuperate in California, but died in the early hours of November 26 in his private railroad car near Louisiana, Missouri. His railroad car was detached and rerouted to St. Louis, and his body was returned to Indianapolis. His funeral was held at St. Paul's Episcopal Church, with accompanying Masonic rites. He was succeeded as Giants president by his son-in-law, Harry Hempstead. In 1913, the Giants organization constructed a stairway from the ticket booths on Coogan's Bluff to the Polo Grounds below, and presented it to the City of New York in honor of its late owner. The John T. Brush Stairway still stands, and was restored by the city in 2013. Sources *Baseball: The Biographical Encyclopedia (2000).

Construction waste (a. k. a. construction and demolition materials, or C&D; materials) consists of unwanted material produced directly or incidentally by the construction or industries. This includes building materials such as insulation, nails, electrical wiring, shingle, and roofing as well as waste originating from site preparation such as dredging materials, tree stumps, and rubble. Construction waste may contain lead, asbestos, or other hazardous substances.  Types of waste  Much building waste is made up of materials such as bricks, concrete and wood damaged or unused for various reasons during construction. Observational research has shown that this can be as high as 10 to 15% of the materials that go into a building, a much higher percentage than the 2.5-5% usually assumed by quantity surveyors and the construction industry. Since considerable variability exists between construction sites, there is much opportunity for reducing this waste.Skoyles ER. Skoyles JR. (1987) Waste Prevention on Site. Mitchell Publishing, London.  Recycling, disposal and environmental impact  Some certain components of construction waste such as plasterboard are hazardous once landfilled. Plasterboard is broken down in landfill conditions releasing hydrogen sulfide, a toxic gas. It is possible to recycle many elements of construction waste. Often roll-off containers are used to transport the waste. Rubble can be crushed and reused in construction projects. Waste wood can also be recovered and recycled. Where recycling is not an option, the disposal of construction waste and hazardous materials must be carried out according to legislation of relevant councils and regulatory bodies. The penalties for improper disposal of construction waste and hazardous waste, including asbestos, can reach into the tens of thousands of dollars for businesses and individuals. In England, all personnel performing builders or construction waste clearance are required by law to be working for a CIS registered business.  Landfilling  The traditional disposal way for construction waste is to send it to landfill sites. Sending the waste directly to a landfill causes many problems: * Waste of natural resources * Increases construction cost, especially the transportation process * Occupies a large area of land * Reduces soil quality * Causes water pollution * Causes air pollution * Produces security risks etc.  Climate impact of construction waste  Construction waste is a source of carbon dioxide emissions.

Stan Lee is the executive producer. The film began pre-production under the working title The Harpy on June 26, 2006 and first aired on June 23, 2007. The movie was shot in Bulgaria. Plot The story for Harpies begins in the fictional world of Modalvia, where Vorian (Peter Jason) is fleeing from the castle guard. When cornered, Vorian releases his minions, the harpies, on the captain of the guard, who dies from the severing of his head. The story reopens to present day where Jason (Baldwin) is late for work at the local museum. His fellow guard Ted restricts him access, but after a blatant and logically flawed threat, he is allowed entrance. In the guards' locker-room we learn that Jason worked for the NYPD and was \\"terminated for cause\\"; and earlier that morning, he filed for divorce from his wife - whom he references as a harpy. On this night, Jason meets a professor (Peter Jason) who discusses the rare artifact (the Obelisk) with harpy carvings in the room that Jason had been eyeing for some time. Threatening with illogical force once again, Jason tells the professor to leave. Unfortunately, Jason is surrounded by mercenaries hired by the professor. After being tied-up, Jason escapes and proceeds to take on the mercenaries by himself, leaving Ted tied up in the locker-room. After defeating the professor's mercenaries, Jason takes an amulet from the professor, claiming: \\"I spent my whole life putting guys like you behind bars, and the NYPD fires me for it.\\" Bargaining is irrelevant as Jason puts the amulet into the \\"crystal egg thingy\\" which opens up a time portal and sucks Jason into medieval times. Upon entering the old world, Jason meets Celestia (Richardson) who accuses Jason of having plans to steal her pigs. Upset and eager to return home, Jason leaves. After walking on a dirt path and thinking aloud a hilarious quip he should have said to Celestia, Jason sees warriors riding horses atop a distant hill. Suddenly, Jason and the warriors are attacked by the harpies. After swinging blindly at the air with their swords, one of the warriors, Celestia's father, is knocked off his horse by a harpy that may have momentarily turned invisible. Jason decides that it's time to help them fight the harpies. The warriors are in awe at Jason's shotgun and pistol (which fell into the portal with him) as he delivers fatal shots to the harpies. The warriors suspiciously accept him and offer Jason a ride to Celestia's house. Once there, Hamish (warrior), the Priest, and Celestia's father talk quietly amongst themselves to try and evaluate what they saw earlier. The Priest claims that Jason could be the a prodigal figure who has been referenced in historical heretical scrolls. They decide to wait and play it by ear. Jason quickly asks for directions to leave, but soon learns of Vorian's wicked control over the king, Lord Castor. Not hearing of the wizard's evil deeds, Jason simply wants to go home. The warriors & Celestia agree to take him to Lord Castor and Vorian to see if they can take him to the present. Before going to bed, Jason flirts with Celestia, who in turn turns him down, but not before calling him lengthy vulgarities of ancient times. The next morning, Vorian meets with Castor, to tell him of Jason's arrival and his means of dispersing of his minions. Castor demands his capture, which Vorian is thrilled with. The warriors enter a destroyed village. They learn that the people have been driven away. Undeterred, Jason still wants to go home, at what ever the cost. Celestia disapproves of this. Jason continues the trek to Castor's castle alone. Once Jason gets to the castle, he meets Caleb, the new captain, who has a sour attitude with Jason and secretly has an allegiance with Vorian. Jason is allowed entrance, where he is drugged by Vorian after revealing his encounter and the events in the museum. As a way of killing him, Vorian and Caleb put Jason atop a tower, where a harpy proceeds to attack him. However, Jason chokes it to death, allowing him to escape with the aid of Hamish and Garek (warrior). The alarm is sounded, and Castor's guards search the forest for Jason. The next day, Vorian visits the Obelisk in his secret harpy cave. He puts his amulet into the egg, but nothing happens. He logically decides that he needs Jason's amulet, and must retrieve it. After discussing Jason's misadventure with Vorian, however, Celestia comes to the conclusion that the amulet Vorian seeks is in the pig-pen Jason fell in. After searching it is found. Hamesh tells everyone that he has two-dozen men waiting for them. In the forest, the soldiers plan a strategy on how to breach Castor's castle and slay Vorian. Jason has the incredible idea of building a trebuchet (catapult) after seeing a special on PBS. Seeing as it is their only option, Hamish agrees and construction begins. Jason and Celestia's father talk, in the aftermath, the father gives a heroic speech about how Jason is their only hope of winning, and that the people have \\"seen too much suffering.\\" The trebuchet complete, the battle begins on the grassland before Castor's castle. In the melee, they breach the wall after trying few times before unsuccessfully. However, Hamish is slain in battle and mourned by Jason and Celestia. Soon, they invade the castle. Vorian prepares to leave after the defeat. Castor threatens Vorian to stop the invasion and let loose his harpies. Vorian tells Castor that he no longer needs the king in his greater plan. Castor prepares to kill the wizard, but Vorian threatens to kill the king by letting the Queen Harpy on him. Garek, Jason, and Aldebert (Hammerdorfer) enter Vorian's potion room to find a cowering Castor and a harpy-protected Vorian. Celestia has been captured, and unless Jason gives him the amulet, \\"she dies\\". Garek and Jason agree on letting the king show them a secret entrance into Vorian's mountain hideout. Eager to kill the king, Castor lies to Garek, Aldebert and the Priest, and runs away. The warriors pursue him. Jason reaches the foot of the mountain. He must drop his weapons and give him the amulet, and he will return Celestia to him. Fooling the wizard however, Jason sneaks the amulet in her mouth after a passionate kiss. Jason advances up the mountain, leaving Celestia to return to her father who awaits her further down the mountain. Learning of Jason's trick, Vorian unleashes a harpy on Celestia and her retreating father. After a quick battle, the father is slain by the harpy, who is in turn slain by Celestia after a shotgun blast to the head. He dies in Celestia's arms. Jason is thrown into a cave where he meets up with a captured Castor. The two sneak down the secret entrance the king mentioned earlier, but in their descent they find thousands of harpy eggs, eventually coming to the conclusion that Vorian is planning a full-scale attack. Celestia, Garek, Aldebert, and the Priest return to the cottage, where Garek is sent to retrieve some items. Alone, Garek faces off with three harpies, managing to kill them all after committing suicide by burning them all alive with himself. Celestia, the Priest, Castor, Jason, and Aldebert unseat Caleb's control over the guards. Castor and Jason discuss a means of countering Vorian and stopping his eggs from hatching. The answer: a battle. So Castor rolls out the trebuchet and begins to fire on Vorian's mountain, while Jason, Celestia, and the Priest go into the mountain. Aldebert leads the troops in his father's footsteps, and Castor fights alongside him. They manage to seal up the mountain, but Aldebert is knocked unconscious by a harpy, and is out for the remainder of the battle. He awakens to learn they have \\"won the battle\\"; both pray for Jason's plan to work, and Aldebert gives him the title: Jason, the Harpy-Slayer. Celestia and Jason continue without the Priest after Celestia decides to leave with Jason after their relationship has blossomed, who is slain upon exiting the mountain by a harpy. Vorian calls upon the aid of the Queen Harpy so that they may retreat. Celestia and Jason begin to pour gas (where ever that came from) on the eggs. After a mild conflict with Vorian, the mountain explodes, but Jason, Vorian, Celestia, and the Queen Harpy are transported into the present day after the uniting of the two amulets. In the museum, a fight between the harpy and Jason, and a struggle between Celestia and Vorian occurs‚Äîupon their arrival, the professor is killed by a ball of fire. Jason breaks the glass of a sword display, and takes one of the two. With it he slays the queen and Vorian, who both are sucked back in time. Celestia and Jason exit the museum arm in arm. Ted observes Jason's destruction and yells for answers. Giving up, Ted heads out of frame, and the story ends.

It is the first ‚Äì and currently the only ‚Äì ballbot with arms. A ball balancing robot also known as a ballbot is a dynamically-stable mobile robot designed to balance on a single spherical wheel (i.e., a ball). Through its single contact point with the ground, a ballbot is omnidirectional and thus exceptionally agile, maneuverable and organic in motion compared to other ground vehicles. Its dynamic stability enables improved navigability in narrow, crowded and dynamic environments. The ballbot works on the same principle as that of an inverted pendulum. History The first successful ballbot was developed in 2005 by Prof. Ralph Hollis of the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), Pittsburgh, USA and it was patented in 2010. The CMU Ballbot is built to be of human size, both in height and footprint. Prof. Hollis and his group at CMU demonstrated that the ballbot can be robust to disturbances including kicks and shoves, and can also handle collisions with furniture and walls . They showed that a variety of interesting human-robot physical interaction behaviors can be developed with the ballbot , and presented planning and control algorithms to achieve fast, dynamic and graceful motions using the ballbot. They also demonstrated the ballbot's capability to autonomously navigate human environments to achieve point-point and surveillance tasks. A pair of two degrees of freedom (DOF) arms was added to the CMU Ballbot in 2011, making it the first and currently, the only ballbot in the world with arms. In 2005, around the same time when CMU Ballbot was introduced, a group of researchers at University of Tokyo independently presented the design for a human-ridable ballbot wheelchair that balances on a basketball named \\"B. B. Rider\\". However, they reported only the design and never presented any experimental results. Around the same time, L√°szl√≥ Havasi from Hungary independently introduced another ballbot called ERROSphere. The robot did not reliably balance and no further work was presented. Since the introduction of CMU Ballbot in 2005, several other groups around the world have developed ballbots. Prof. Masaaki Kumagai developed BallIP in 2008 at Tohoku Gakuin University, Japan. Prof. Kumagai and his group demonstrated the capability of ballbots to carry loads and be used for cooperative transportation. They developed a number of small ballbots and demonstrated cooperative transportation using them. A group of mechanical engineering students at ETH Zurich, Switzerland developed Rezero in 2010. Rezero re-emphasized the fast and graceful motions that can be achieved using ballbots. Tom√°s Arribas (Spain) developed the first ballbot using LEGO Mindstorms NXT in 2008 as the Master Project at University of Alcala.Tom√°s Arribas (August 2008). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ5K0tZ2ZOk He developed a simulation project with Microsoft Excel to easily simulate the system. As part of the research carried out inside the Space Research Group of the University of Alcal√° (SRG-UAH), Spain, the work team, specialised in optimal control and planning applied to non-linear dynamic systems, published in 2012 the article called \\"A Monoball Robot Based on LEGO Mindstorms\\"( S. S√°nchez, T. Arribas, M. G√≥mez and O. Polo, ‚ÄúA Monoball Robot Based on LEGO Mindstorms,‚Äù IEEE Control Systems Magazine, vol. 32, no. 2, pp. 71‚Äì83, 2012.) This article describes the math model and trajectory control as a baseline to unstable and non-linear control systems. Yorihisa Yamamoto (Japan) inspired by Tom√°s Arribas's project, developed a ballbot using LEGO Mindstorms NXT in 2009 . He created a detailed demo to build, model and create controllers using MATLAB. A group of mechanical engineering students at University of Adelaide (Australia) developed both a LEGO ballbot and a full-scale ballbot in 2009. A group of students from ITMO University (Russia) introduced an algorithm and constructed a ballbot based on LegoNXT robotics kit which performed stability with only two actuators used. Videos on YouTube present ballbots developed around the world. Some of them have been developed using LEGO Mindstorms NXT. Other custom designs use omni-wheels to actuate the ball. Thomas K√∏lb√¶k Jespersen (Denmark) developed the Kugle ballbot as his final master thesis in 2019. The Kugle ballbot is a human-sized ballbot developed as part of an ongoing Human Robot Interaction research project at Aalborg University. Equipped with three motors and omniwheels, an onboard Intel NUC, two SICK LiDARs, an ARM microprocessor and a tablet on the top, the robot is capable of maneuvering autonomously in indoor environments and guide people around. The master thesis takes a different approach to the system modelling by deriving a non-linear quaternion-based dynamic model which is used to derive a non-linear sliding mode controller to stabilize the balance and a path-following model predictive controller to plan and execute smooth trajectories. The complete master thesis and all material including MATLAB source code and C++ controller implementations are publicly available on GitHub. Ballbots have also appeared in the science fiction world. Pixar's 2008 movie Wall-E featured \\"M-O\\" (Microbe Obliterator), a ballbot cleaning robot. Syfy's 2010 TV series Caprica featured \\"Serge\\", a ballbot butler robot. Motivation and characteristics Historically, mobile robots have been designed to be statically stable, which results in the robot not needing to expend energy while standing still. This is typically achieved through the use of three or more wheels on a base. In order to avoid tipping, these statically-stable mobile robots have a wide base for a large polygon of support, and a lot of dead weight in the base to lower the center of gravity. They also tend to have low acceleration or deceleration to avoid tipping. The wide base makes it difficult for statically-stable mobile robots to navigate cluttered human environments. Moreover, these robots have several other limitations that make them poorly suited to a constantly changing human environment. They can neither roll in any direction, nor can they turn in place. The desire to build tall and narrow mobile robots that do not tip over led to development of balancing mobile robots like the ballbot. A ballbot generally has a body that balances on top of a single spherical wheel (ball). It forms an underactuated system, i.e., there are more degrees of freedom (DOF) than there are independent control inputs. The ball is directly controlled using actuators, whereas the body has no direct control. The body is kept upright about its unstable equilibrium point by controlling the ball, much like the control of an inverted pendulum. This leads to limited but perpetual position displacements of the ballbot. The counter-intuitive aspect of the ballbot motion is that in order to move forward, the body has to lean forward and in order to lean forward, the ball must roll backwards. All these characteristics make planning to achieve desired motions for the ballbot a challenging task. In order to achieve a forward straight line motion, the ballbot has to lean forward to accelerate and lean backward to decelerate. Further, the ballbot has to lean into curves in order to compensate for centripetal forces, which results in elegant and graceful motions. Unlike two- wheeled balancing mobile robots like Segway that balance in one direction but cannot move in the lateral direction, the ballbot is omni-directional and hence, can roll in any direction. It has no minimal turning radius and does not have to yaw in order to change direction. System description Major design parameters The most fundamental design parameters of a ballbot are its height, mass, its center of gravity and the maximum torque its actuators can provide. The choice of those parameters determine the robot's moment of inertia, the maximum pitch angle and thus its dynamic and acceleration performance and agility. The maximum velocity is a function of actuator power and its characteristics. Besides the maximum torque, the pitch angle is additionally upper bounded by the maximum force which can be transmitted from the actuators to the ground. Therefore, friction coefficients of all parts involved in force transmission also play a major role in system design. Also, close attention has to be paid to the ratio of the moment of inertia of the robot body and its ball in order to prevent undesired ball spin, especially while yawing. Ball and actuation The ball is the core element of a ballbot, it has to transmit and bear all arising forces and withstand mechanical wear caused by rough contact surfaces. A high friction coefficient of its surface and a low inertia are essential. The CMU Ballbot, Rezero and Kugle used a hollow metal sphere with poly-urethane coating. B.B. Rider used a basketball, while BallIP and Adelaide Ballbot used bowling balls coated with a thin layer of rubber. In order to solve the rather complex problem of actuating a sphere, a variety of different actuation mechanisms have been introduced. The CMU Ballbot used an inverse mouse-ball drive mechanism. Unlike the traditional mouse ball that drives the mouse rollers to provide computer input, the inverse mouse-ball drive uses rollers to drive the ball producing motion. The inverse mouse-ball drive uses four rollers to drive the ball and each roller is actuated by an independent electric motor. In order to achieve yaw motion, the CMU Ballbot uses a bearing, slip-ring assembly and a separate motor to spin the body on top of the ball. The LEGO Ballbot also used an inverse mouse-ball drive, but used normal wheels to drive the ball instead of rollers. Unlike CMU Ballbot both BallIP, Rezero and Kugle use omni-wheels to drive the ball. This drive mechanism does not require a separate yaw drive mechanism and allows direct control of the yaw rotation of the ball. Unlike CMU Ballbot that uses four motors for driving the ball and one motor for yaw rotation, BallIP, Rezero and Kugle use only three motors for both the operations. Moreover, they only have three force transmission points compared to four points on CMU Ballbot. Since the contact between an omni-wheel and the ball should be reduced to a single point, most available omni-wheels are not properly suitable for this task because of the gaps between the individual smaller wheels that result in an unsteady rolling motion. Therefore, the BallIP project introduced a more complex omni-wheel with a continuous circumferential contact line. The Rezero team equipped this omni-wheel design with roller bearings and a high-friction coating. They also additionally fitted a mechanical ball arrester that presses the ball against the actuators in order to further increase friction forces and a suspension to dampen vibrations. The Kugle robot is equipped with a skirt which holds the ball in place to avoid that the ball gets pushed out during large inclinations. The Adelaide Ballbot uses wheels for its LEGO version and traditional omni-wheels for its full-scale version. Prof. Masaaki Kumagai, who developed BallIP introduced another ball drive mechanism that uses partially sliding rollers . The objective of this design was to develop 3-DOF actuation on the ball using a low cost mechanism. Sensors In order to actively control the position and body orientation of a ballbot by a sensor-computer-actuator framework, beside a suitable microprocessor or some sort of other computing unit to run the necessary control loops, a ballbot fundamentally requires a series of sensors which allow to measure the orientation of the ball and the ballbot body as a function of time. To keep track of the motions of the ball, rotary encoders (CMU Ballbot, BallIP, Rezero, Kugle) are usually used. Measuring the body orientation is more complicated and is often done by the use of gyroscopes (NXT Ballbots) or, more generally, an Inertial Measurement Unit (CMU Ballbot, BallIP, Rezero, Kugle) which includes an accelerometer, gyroscope and possibly magnetometer whose measurements are fused into the body orientation through AHRS algorithms. The CMU Ballbot uses a Hokuyo URG-04LX Laser Range Finder to localize itself in a 2D map of the environment. It also uses the laser range finder for detecting obstacles and avoiding them. Conversely the Kugle robot uses two SICK TiM571 2D LiDAR to localize itself, perform obstacle avoidance and detect people for guidance. Arms The CMU Ballbot is the first and currently, the only ballbot to have arms. It has a pair of 2-DOF arms that are driven by series-elastic actuators. The arms are hollow aluminium tubes with a provision to add dummy weights at their ends. In their present state, the arms cannot be used for any significant manipulation, but are used to study their effects on the dynamics of ballbot. System modeling, planning and control The mathematical MIMO-model which is needed in order to simulate a ballbot and to design a sufficient controller which stabilizes the system, is very similar to an inverted pendulum on a cart. The LEGO NXT Ballbot, Adelaide Ballbot, Rezero and Kugle include actuator models in their robot models, whereas CMU Ballbot neglects the actuator models and models the Ballbot as a body on top of a ball. Initially, CMU Ballbot used two 2D planar models in perpendicular planes to model the ballbot and at present, uses 3D models without yaw motion for both the ballbot without arms and the ballbot with arms. BallIP uses a model that describes the dependence of the ball position on the wheel velocities and the body motion. Rezero uses a full 3D model that includes yaw motion too. Kugle uses a fully coupled quaternion- based 3D model which couples the motion of all axes. The ballbots (CMU Ballbot, BallIP, NXT Ballbot, Adelaide Ballbot, Rezero) use linear feedback control approaches to maintain balance and achieve motion. The CMU Ballbot uses an inner balancing control loop that maintains the body at desired body angles and an outer loop controller that achieves desired ball motions by commanding body angles to the balancing controller. The Kugle robot is tested with both linear feedback controllers (LQR) and non-linear sliding mode controllers to show the benefit of its coupled dynamic quaternion model. A ballbot is a shape-accelerated underactuated system. The inclination angles of a ballbot is thus dynamically linked to the resulting accelerations of the ball and robot leading to an underactuated system. The CMU Ballbot plans motions in the space of body lean angles in order to achieve fast, dynamic and graceful ball motions. With the introduction of arms, CMU Ballbot uses its planning procedure to plan in the space of both body lean angles and arm angles to achieve desired ball motions. Moreover, it can also account for cases where the arms are constrained to certain specific motions and only body angles have to be used to achieve desired ball motions. The CMU Ballbot uses an integrated planning and control framework to autonomously navigate human environments. Its motion planner plans in the space of controllers to produce graceful navigation, and achieves point-point and surveillance tasks. It uses the laser range finder to actively detect and avoid both static and dynamic obstacles in its environment. For Kugle a path-planning model predictive controller (MPC) is designed to control the inclination angles of the ballbot to follow a given path. A path-following strategy is chosen over common trajectory or reference tracking controllers to accommodate for the temporally lacking behaviour of ballbots due to the underactuated nature. The path is parameterized as a polynomial and included into the cost-function of the MPC. A set of soft-constraints ensures that obstacles are avoided and that progress is made with a desired speed. Safety features The biggest concern with a ballbot is its safety in case of a system failure. There have been several attempts in addressing this concern. The CMU Ballbot introduced three retractable landing legs that allow the robot to remain standing (statically- stable) after being powered down. It is also capable of automatically transitioning from this statically-stable state to the dynamically-stable, balancing state and vice versa. Rezero featured a roll-over safety mechanism in order to prevent serious damage in case of a system failure. Possible applications Due to its dynamic stability, a ballbot can be tall and narrow, and can also be physically interactive, making it an ideal candidate for a personal mobile robot. It can act as an effective service robot at homes and offices and offer guidance to people in e.g. malls and airports. The present day ballbots are restricted to smooth surfaces. The concept of the ballbot has attracted a lot of media attention, and several ballbot characters have appeared in Hollywood movies.WALL-E Hence, the ballbot has a variety of applications in the entertainment industry, including toys.

History The station was opened by the Great Western Railway (GWR) on 9 April 1934, originally being named \\"Finstock Halt\\" and having two platforms. Each platform was approached by an inclined path from Charlbury Road, and each had a corrugated iron shelter with windows only in the end walls. On 5 May 1969 it was renamed \\"Finstock\\". The line was singled on 29 November 1971, the former up line now carrying traffic in both directions, and the redundant down platform was removed. By September 1980 the former GWR waiting shelter had been replaced by a simple shelter open on three sides. On 9 March 1987 the former up platform was taken out of use and replaced by one built over the site of the former down line. Since at least February 1999 the station has been served by just one train per day in each direction. Evidence of the former up platform and access ramp is now overgrown.

This station and all trains serving it are operated by Great Western Railway. After almost 40 years as a single-platform station, the track through Charlbury station was redoubled with the recommissioning of a second platform on 6 June 2011 as part of the project to improve reliability and increase traffic capacity on the Cotswold Line. History Charlbury station on 9 January 2011, showing concrete sleepers newly laid for the restoration of double track and platform 2 The Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway opened the station in 1853. It is notable for the original station building, a wooden chalet-type structure in the Italianate architectural style of Isambard Kingdom Brunel; together with the early station nameboard this is a Grade II listed building restored in 1979. Until 1970 the station had a goods shed, a 30 cwt crane and a 34-lever signal box. The signal box was demolished when the line through the station was singled on 29 November 1971. Sir Peter Parker (1924‚Äì2002), the former Chairman of the British Railways Board, was a regular user of the station. With the completion of the first stage of the redoubling of the Cotswold Line from to a point east of Charlbury, the second platform, decommissioned in 1971, was reinstated and returned to service on 6 June 2011.  2018 Improvement Works  Charlbury and Kingham are two of the stations on the Cotswold Line that had their platforms lengthened to accommodate longer GWR Class 802 units, which are nine carriages long ‚Äî one carriage longer than the longest trains that previously used the station.  Facilities Charlbury station is one of the only two- platform stations on the Cotswold Line to have step-free access to both platforms.

The film parodies various Western films; the film's title is a take-off of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Huckleberry is constantly referred to as a \\"mysterious, steely-eyed, and silent-type stranger\\" (though Huck is just being himself), spoofing the Western stock character of the Man with No Name. Several other plot points are lifted from well-known film Westerns, such as High Noon and High Plains Drifter. This film marks the final time Daws Butler voiced Huckleberry Hound, Quick Draw McGraw and Baba Looey, Snagglepuss, Hokey Wolf, and Peter Potamus, as he died three days after its telecast from a heart attack. This is the only movie in the Superstars 10 series where Huckleberry is the main character. Dinky Dalton from Laff-A-Lympics is featured. Plot In 1849 California, Huckleberry Hound rides west on his horse in search of a place to start a country farm. He discovers the small town of Two-Bit, which is being menaced by the outlaw brothers, the Dalton Gang consisting of Dinky, Finky, Pinky, and Stinky. Stinky was apprehended and sentenced to prison by Judge Tumbleweed Flopner. The Daltons steal Huck's belongings and coerce him into a game of poker, the stakes being a gold nugget Huck carries for his things. Huck accuses the Daltons of cheating, so they challenge him to a boxing match, which Huck wins. Huck goes to Quick Draw McGraw and Baba Looey's bank to deposit his gold, and wins a prize of his choice. He chooses a fountain pen, being partial to its blue ink. The Daltons rob the bank, stealing the nugget and the pen. Mayor Hokey Wolf calls an emergency town meeting and hurriedly appoints Huck as Two- Bit's new sheriff. Sheriff Huck hunts the Daltons and apprehends and jails them after some struggle. Stinky breaks out of prison with the Bit-2 News and reporter Magilla Gorilla covering the news. Huck receives a letter from Stinky Dalton. Stinky challenges Huck to a gunfight. None of the townsfolk want to help and flee to Tahiti. Stinky fails to kill Huck, so he breaks his brothers out of jail disguised as their grandmother. Despite his horse trying to rescue him, Huck chases the Daltons until they strap him to a rocket and launch him into the sky, where he is presumably blown up. The Daltons go on to become the richest outlaws in the West, taking over Two-Bit and renaming it \\"Daltonville\\". When the townsfolk return, the Daltons kick them out aboard a freight train and the townsfolk blame themselves for Huck's death and the loss of Two-Bit, or so they think. The rocket crashes at a Native American tribal community. Huck survives with amnesia and is found by the chief's daughter, Desert Flower. The two fall in love and Huck proposes marriage, but first Huck must undergo a two-part test for the chief's blessing. The first test is a game show, which Huck wins despite the chief meddling with his buzzer. For the second test, Huck has to wrestle Chuckling Chipmunk, the tribe's strongest man and Desert Flower's rival suitor. Huck loses, but saves Desert Flower when she falls in a river, earning the chief's blessing. Huck is about to undergo the ceremony when his horse returns and restores his memory, reminding him that the Daltons are still at large while also mentioning that his real name is Bob. Huck promises to return for Desert Flower and departs. Huck finds the townsfolk of Two-Bit working at a circus and urges them to help him take back their town. Recruiting a projectionist and showgirl Rusty Nails, Huck plans to use special effects to pose as a ghost and scare the Daltons away. Rusty shows a film to the Daltons warning that Huck's ghost will arrive in Daltonville on the \\"midnight ghost train\\". The Daltons are terrified except for Stinky, who refuses to be intimidated. Huck arrives aboard the train and scares the Daltons, including Stinky, but they refuse to go to jail. The Two-Bit townsfolk chase them into the state prison, disguised as the Daltons' hideout. Huck reveals his ruse and is congratulated for bringing the Daltons to justice. The narrator revealed what happened to Huck and the townsfolk: * Snagglepuss back working as a theater actor. * Quick Draw becomes Two-Bit's new sheriff with Baba Looey as his deputy. * Hokey Wolf runs a Used Wagon Lot in Two Bit. * Yogi and Boo-Boo return to Jellystone Park. * Huck returns to the tribe to marry Desert Flower, starting his farm and raising a family with her.

He was a pioneer of Anatolian rock, a prolific songwriter, impresario, multi-instrumentalist, and an early experimentalist. Due to a heart disease, he died on September 22, 2001.  Early life  Kƒ±zƒ±lok was introduced to music during his secondary school years at the Galatasaray High School, a top high school in Turkey that produced music legends Barƒ±≈ü Man√ßo and Timur Sel√ßuk as well, although Kƒ±zƒ±lok went on later to study dentistry. His first instrument was an accordion. He took his first music lessons from one of his classmates' father. His first performance was at Taksim Belediye Gazinosu, as April 23 celebrations. He performed here, with his group named Fikret Kƒ±zƒ±lok and the Band. Their biggest hit was a cover of a famous folksong 'Tamzara'.  Career  He switched to rhythm guitar in 1963 when he met Cahit Oben. Together, they formed the group Cahit Oben 4, with Koray Oktay on bass and Erol Ula≈ütƒ±r on drums. Cahit Oben 4 describe themselves as a group playing Beatles kind of music. They started performing √áatƒ± Gece Kul√ºb√º, a nightclub managed by ƒ∞lham Gencer. As a side job, they also performed at several open-air neighborhood concerts. Their first release in 1965 was the Beatles-inspired song \\"I Wanna Be Your Man.\\" Later that year, Cahit Oben 4's second single included their first Turkish-language folksong, \\"Silifke'nin Yoƒüurdu,\\" with the B-side featuring the first song written by Kƒ±zƒ±lok, \\"Hereke.\\" Cahit Oben 4 contested at H√ºrriyet's 1965 Golden Microphone Music awards, with their \\"Makaram Sarƒ± Baƒülar / Halime\\" release. After, Cahit Oben 4 broke-up, while Cahit Oben wanted to resume his life with his fiance F√ºsun √ñnal. After taking a brief break from music to finish dentistry school, Kƒ±zƒ±lok performed alongside Barƒ±≈ü Man√ßo for nearly a year before releasing his first solo single, \\"Ay Osman ‚Äì Sevgilim (Colours ‚Äì Baby).\\" In 1969, Kƒ±zƒ±lok traveled with writer Arda Uskan to Sivas to meet famed folk poet A≈üƒ±k Veysel, and to procure permission to record a cover of his song \\"Uzun ƒ∞nce Bir Yoldayƒ±m\\" (I'm on a long, thin road), which started a friendship between them. Kƒ±zƒ±lok later returned to live with Veysel for several months, taking saz lessons as well. His 1969 cover of \\"Uzun ƒ∞nce Bir Yoldayƒ±m / Benim A≈ükƒ±m Beni Ge√ßti\\" went to number one in the Turkish charts, and was Kƒ±zƒ±lok's first gold album. Kƒ±zƒ±lok quit music for about a year in 1973 following the death of A≈üƒ±k Veysel. While Kƒ±zƒ±lok's music hadn't previously been especially concerned with political themes, in the 1970s his music began to become more intertwined with politics. He set the poetry of a number of prominent politically active poets to music, including Ahmed Arif's \\"Vurulmu≈üum\\" (1971), A≈üƒ±k Mahzuni ≈ûerif's \\"Daraƒüacƒ±\\" (1975) and former prime minister B√ºlent Ecevit's \\"Olmasƒ±n Varsƒ±n (debuted live on TV in 1975). His album Not Defterimden (1977) featured experiments in atonal music and readings of poetry by Nazim Hikmet. However, the worsening political situation in late 1970s Turkey, and the banning of Ecevit from politics following the September 12, 1980 coup d'etat, contributed to Kƒ±zƒ±lok's forced break from music between 1977 and 1983. Kƒ±zƒ±lok's first album following this break, Zaman Zaman (From Time to Time), featured a shift from politics to love songs. This album, and the 1990 solo album Yana Yana (Burning Inside), contain many of the songs that Kƒ±zƒ±lok is best known for today. During the same period, he collaborated with a number of musicians, including fellow singer-songwriter B√ºlent Orta√ßgil, environmental activist and singer Leman Sam, and fretless guitarist pioneer Erkan Oƒüur.  Death  Kƒ±zƒ±lok suffered a heart attack in 1998, the year he finished his last studio album, Mustafa Kemal ‚Äì Devrimcinin G√ºncesi (Mustafa Kemal ‚Äì A Revolutionary's Diary). Although he was working on a new album, preliminarily entitled Suya Yazƒ±lan ≈ûarkƒ±lar, this never was to be released. After the heart attack, and intensive care, his condition stabilized for some time. He wrote one last poem for the nurse who took care of him. Even though he had a cardiac pacemaker, due to a second heart attack in July 2001, he died in September 2001. Legacy Kƒ±zƒ±lok had 13 gold records to his name, and many number one singles. He was the first artist in Turkish history to be the object of a bidding war, ultimately receiving 50,000 lira to leave Sayan for Grafson. Many musicians have recorded covers of his songs, including Barƒ±≈ü Akarsu (\\"Bu Kalp Seni Unutur mu?\\" and \\"Yeter Ki\\"), Funda Arar (\\"Haberin Var mƒ±?\\"), Mehmet Erdem (\\"Bir Harmanƒ±m bu Ak≈üam\\"), Mor ve √ñtesi (\\"Sevda √ái√ßeƒüi\\"), Leman Sam and ≈ûevval Sam (\\"G√∂n√ºl\\"), and Sibel Sezai (\\"Ben Gidersem\\"). The TV series Bu Kalp Seni Unutur mu? was named after one of his songs. Kƒ±zƒ±lok was also an innovative instrumentalist and album arranger, the first to incorporate sitar and Indian tabla within Turkish pop music.

There is now continuous urban development between Doughiska and the city centre due to the growth of Galway City in recent years. History Local legend has it that the name of the area comes from the mid 19th century, when on a warm summers day, British soldiers asked the local Gaelic speaking natives for a fresh water source. The locals did not fully understand what they were saying and kept replying \\"Dough Uisce\\" to the soldiers. It is said that the soldiers did not respond favorably to this and badly assaulted (some versions say murdered) the locals. It is thought that this encounter occurred in the Merlin Park area of Galway City. The area remained a rural area on the outskirts of Galway City, with only a few families farming the area until the late 20th century. The area also contained a marble quarry, with marble from this quarry being used in the refurbished Galway Cathedral Present Day Most of the open fields are now being developed for housing, hotels and business parks. The main reason for this is the presence of B√≥thar na dTreabh, the dual carriageway leading into the city from the east. The area was the subject to massive development from the year 2000 onward. Galway City council planners designated the area for development from the 1990s. Houses were built at a rapid rate and infrastructure was slow in following. However, in recent years, the situation has vastly improved and the city's bus service has recently expanded to provide a much needed extended service to and from the city centre every 15 minutes. The area is also subject to be served by the GLUAS light rail project, which is proposed for Galway City. Doughiska now has a primary and secondary school serving the area. The area is adjacent to the Parkmore Industrial Estate as well as the Clayton Hotel and Briarhill Shopping centre. It is thought that Doughiska is one of the most diverse areas in the west of Ireland, with over 70 nationalities living in the area. Doughiska now has a park, several playing pitches, Basketball and tennis court as well as a skateboard park. The area is also served by two hospitals with Merlin Park University Hospital to the west and the private Galway Clinic to the east of Doughiska. The area also contains Merlin Park woods, which is one of the few expansive areas of matured woodland still remaining within the Galway City area. Sport The area is served by the Merlin Woods FC & Sports Club. Doughiska is also in the catchment area of Castlegar GAA Hurling club. Castlegar became the 1st club from west of the Shannon river to win a club All Ireland in 1980. The area is also served by St James GAA club in Gaelic Football. Both clubs compete in the Galway senior club championship. The area is also adjacent to Ballybrit racecourse, home of the famous Galway Races Notable Moments Pope John Paul II visited Ballybrit racecourse on 30 September 1979 during his visit to Ireland. There was a mass held for the young people of Ireland where the Pope famously said \\"Young people of Ireland, I love you\\". There were 280,000 people in attendance that day. Doughiska has also hosted numerous outdoor concerts for the Galway Arts Festival. Notable acts to have performed include Radiohead, Robert Plant, Moby, The Beastie Boys and Pulp.

He was a cousin of the famous Ukrainian composer Mykola Lysenko and father-in-law of Ivan Steshenko.

V.; Holford, M.; Puillandre, N. in the Journal of Molluscan Studies, including the definition of new genera and the redistribution of many species to other genera. Shell description The shells of the sea snails in this family are typically shaped like slender augers or screws. In that respect they share certain shell characters with the family Turritellidae, the turret shells. One characteristic that distinguishes Terebridae from Turritellidae is the short anterior canal or notch in the aperture of the shell. Terebridae shells also tend to have characteristically flattened versus convex whorls, and they often have one or two plaits on the columella. Numerous species in this family are grouped under the genera Terebra or Hastula, and a minority of species are placed in four other genera. Life habits These snails are sand-dwelling carnivores which live in warmer waters. In most species, a venomous barb similar to that of the cone snails, (see Conidae), is used to stun and immobilize prey, which typically consists of various marine worms.

The plot is about a young woman who rejects marriage to become a kept woman. The film is based on the book 20,000 Streets Under the Sky by Patrick Hamilton.BITTER HARVEST Monthly Film Bulletin; London Vol. 30, Iss. 348, (Jan 1, 1963): 157. Plot A beautiful but intoxicated woman, Jennie Jones (Janet Munro), returns to her London apartment late one night and begins to destroy its contents in a rage, throwing her purse, keys and many of her expensive gowns out into the street. Her story is then told in flashback. As a young girl, Jennie lives in an economically depressed, former mining town in Wales, where she works in her father's shabby general store and dreams of a more glamorous life. The store is doing poorly, and Jennie is horrified to discover that her father wants her to move to Cardiff and live with her elderly aunts as a companion and caregiver. While walking through Cardiff, Jennie and her friend Violet meet two well-off older men, Andy and Rex. The men take the girls to a fashionable bar and club for drinks and dancing, and Jennie gets drunk and passes out in Andy's car. She wakes up naked in bed in the men's apartment in London, having lost her virginity while drunk, and estranged herself from her father by staying out all night. She goes to meet Andy at a London pub, but when he fails to show, she is befriended by the kindly barman, Bob Williams (John Stride), to the chagrin of the barmaid Ella who is attracted to Bob. Not wanting to return to her home, Jennie says to Bob that she is pregnant and accepts his offer of help. Bob moves her into his flat and supports them both on his wages, planning to marry her soon. However, Jennie quickly becomes bored, and accepts an invitation from Bob's actor neighbour to attend a party in honour of a well-known producer, Karl Denny (Alan Badel). Jennie tells Bob she is attending the party to get work as a model or actress, and convinces him to give her a large sum of money to buy a proper party dress. Denny notices Jennie at the party and asks her to see him the following night, ostensibly about an acting role. After the party, a drunken Jennie creates a disturbance when she goes home to Bob's apartment. The next night, when Jennie fails to return from her appointment with Denny, Bob goes to Denny's apartment to find her and they argue, with Jennie revealing that she is not pregnant, does not love Bob and does not want to marry him. Heartbroken, Bob leaves and Jennie becomes Denny's mistress. The flashback ends and the film returns to the scene shown at the start. The morning after Jennie's drunken rampage, she is found dead amidst the wreckage of her apartment (including a smashed framed photograph of Denny), having overdosed on pills. The police find her address book full of men's numbers, suggesting she had been promiscuous. The ambulance carrying Jennie's body almost collides with Bob and Ella, now a happy couple oblivious to Jennie's tragic fate.

Smythe (6 July 1900 ‚Äì 27 June 1949), was an English mountaineer, author, photographer and botanist. He is best remembered for his mountaineering in the Alps as well as in the Himalayas, where he identified a region that he named the \\"Valley of Flowers\\", now a protected park. His ascents include two new routes on the Brenva Face of Mont Blanc, Kamet, and attempts on Kangchenjunga and Mount Everest in the 1930s. It was said that he had a tendency for irascibility, something some of his mountaineering contemporaries said \\"decreased with altitude\\". Biography Smythe was born at Maidstone in Kenthttp://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/world-records/england-and-wales- births-1837-2006?firstname=francis%20s&firstname;_variants=true&lastname;=smythe&eventyear;=1900&eventyear;_offset=0 and educated in Switzerland after an initial period at Berkhamsted School. He trained as an electrical engineer and worked for brief periods with the Royal Air Force and Kodak before devoting himself to writing and public lecturing. Smythe enjoyed mountaineering, photography, collecting plants, and gardening; he toured as a lecturer; and he wrote a total of twenty seven books. Smythe's focused approach is well documented, not only through his own writings, but by his contemporaries and later works. Among his many public lectures, Smythe gave several to the Royal Geographical Society, his first in 1931 titled \\"Explorations in Garhwal around Kamet\\" and his second in 1947 titled \\"An Expedition to the Lloyd George Mountains, North-East British Columbia\\". Smythe was a prodigious writer and produced many popular books. However his book \\"The Kangchenjunga Adventure\\" launched Smythe as a legitimate and respected author. During the Second World War he served in the Canadian Rockies as a mountaineer training officer for the Lovat Scouts. He went on to write two books about climbing in the Rockies, Rocky Mountains (1948) and Climbs in the Canadian Rockies (1951). Mount Smythe (10,650 ft) was named in his honour. In 1949, in Delhi, he was taken ill with food poisoning; then a succession of malaria attacks took their toll. He died on 27 June 1949, two weeks before his 49th birthday. Mountaineering * 1927 and 1928 Smythe, together with T. Graham Brown, made the first ascent of two routes on the Brenva Face of Mont Blanc, the Sentinelle Rouge and Route Major. These were the first routes to be put up on the face. * 1930 Smythe was a member of the international team (Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Great Britain), to attempt Kangchenjunga, under the leadership of G√ºnter Dyhrenfurth. * 1931 Smythe was the leader of the first successful expedition to climb Kamet (7,756 m) in 1931, at the time it was the highest peak yet climbed. During the Kamet expedition Smythe and R. L. Holdsworth discovered what they called the Valley of Flowers in the Himalaya, now in the state of Uttarakhand, India. * 1933 Smythe was a member of Hugh Ruttledge's Everest expedition. * 1936 Smythe was again a member of Hugh Ruttledge's 2nd Everest Expedition. * 1938 Smythe was a member of the Mount Everest expedition led by Bill Tilman.

The reversal was inconvenient for trains which did not need to call at Chipping Norton Junction, so for their benefit the GWR built a bridge to carry through trains between Banbury and Cheltenham over the Oxford and Worcester line; it opened to goods trains on 8 January 1906 and to passenger trains on 1 May 1906.MacDermot, Vol. II, Chapter XI The Great Awakening, pp. 432, 610 The station was renamed Kingham on 1 May 1909.Hemmings, Chapter Six Under the Great Western, p. 163Marks, Disused Railways website Upon the opening of this new link, a new express train service began to use the line, including the new flyover, once a day in each direction. This train, unofficially known as the Ports to Ports Express, was a collaboration between the North Eastern Railway, the Great Central Railway and the GWR, which from 1 May 1906 ran between and via , , , , and ;Hemmings, Chapter Six, pp. 138, 163 in August 1906 it was extended to serve , via the Barry Railway; in July 1909 a through coach to and from Hull was introduced.Harris, Chapter Eight Cross Country Inter-Railway Services to 1922, pp. 106‚Äì107 It ran non-stop between Banbury and , but even so, took 82 minutes for this stretch.

The remaining track between the boxes formed the base of a self-contained triangle for turning engines. By this time, the line to King's Sutton was only open for freight and a token passenger service operated to Chipping Norton. British Railways withdrew passenger services from Kingham to Cheltenham and Chipping Norton in 1962 and freight services in 1964. British Rail designated the Oxford and Worcester line \\"The Cotswold Line\\". Passenger traffic has increased in the 1990s and 2000s. In 2015, a car park extension has been added with 100 car spaces, and a new footbridge is being added, with provision for passenger lifts. In 2020, the station featured in an episode of the BBC Three mockumentary series This Country. Locomotive depot A small depot was constructed in 1881 for the Cheltenham extension; this was in the Chipping Norton branch fork, and had a turntable,Hemmings, Chapter Six, p. 101 which was too small for a tender locomotive to be turned. This was replaced by a turntable early in the twentieth century, large enough for a \\"Dean Goods\\" 0-6-0 tender locomotive;Hemmings, Chapter Six, p. 125 however the depot closed in 1906. It was rebuilt, reopening again in 1913, as a sub-shed of Worcester, but the turntable was later removed, and the depot finally closed in December 1962.Lyons, Worcester Division, p. 168 Accidents and incidents *On 15 July 1966, an express passenger train was derailed due to an unsecured switch blade on a set of points.

On Fridays, the show was usually hosted by a guest host; the most recent rotation included Michael Smerconish, Dom Giordano (Both from CBS Radio's Philadelphia Station, WPHT-AM) and Doug McIntyre (Tony Snow also was a regular substitute for this show until his 2008 death). The show launched on May 8, 2002 on 205 stations, in 19 of the top 20 markets across the country; as of the end of 2008, his affiliate count was over 400. In addition to terrestrial radio, the show could be heard live on Fox News Talk, available on XM Satellite Radio and SIRIUS Satellite Radio, as well as simulcast over the Internet. February 26, 2009 was the last broadcast with Bill O'Reilly. A news story at the time reported O'Reilly as saying the workload for his radio and TV duties had become too much. The Fred Thompson Show replaced O'Reilly the following March 2. According to the September 2007 issue of Talkers Magazine, in terms of audience The Radio Factor was in the top twelve of nationally aired talk shows. It was the second-highest rated show in its time slot, behind only The Rush Limbaugh Show. Aftermath Wiehl would later accuse O'Reilly of a non- consensual sexual relationship, though she would later retract that claim in exchange for a financial settlement, one of many settlements O'Reilly negotiated that led to his dismissal from Fox News. Ten years after The Radio Factor ended, O'Reilly returned to radio with a daily 15-minute show, The O'Reilly Update.Over 100 affiliates air \\"The O'Reilly Update debut - All Access.com See also * Fox News Channel * The O'Reilly Factor References External links * BillOReilly.com Conservative talk radio Bill O'Reilly (political commentator) ","title":"The Radio Factor"},{"id":"6457701","text":"4 of a Kind is the fourth album by the American crossover thrash band D.R.I., which was released in 1988.

He exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1915 and at the Paris Salon in 1907. In the Tate Gallery is his Royal Academy painting of 1905 entitled The Morning of Sedgemoor depicting the Duke of Monmouth's rebels resting in a barn before the battle.

Ibuki was named after Mount Ibuki, located between Gifu and Shiga prefectures in Honsh≈´. On 28 August 1912, the Ibukis were re-classified as battlecruisers. Design and construction Problems with her turbine engines delayed the construction of Ibuki, and construction began almost two years later than her sister ship, Kurama, which used standard reciprocating engines. Ibuki was built at Kure Naval Arsenal and was laid down on 22 May 1907, launched on 21 October 1907, and commissioned on 11 November 1907. Operational history Shortly after she was commissioned, Ibuki was sent on a voyage to Thailand to attend the coronation ceremony of the Thai king Rama VI Vajiravudh. Ibuki served in World War I, participating in the hunt for the German light cruiser . She escorted a convoy of 10 troop transports carrying the Main Body of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, crossing the Tasman Sea with the British protected cruiser and armoured cruiser HMS Minotaur to Albany, Western Australia in November. Together with the Australian light cruiser , Ibuki escorted the ANZACs, consisting of 20,000 men and 7,500 horses, across the Indian Ocean. Ibuki was the only protection for the ANZACs when Sydney participated in the Battle of Cocos. The commander of Ibuki, Captain Kanji Kat≈çO'Brien, pp. The Anglo-Japanese alliance, 1902-1922, p. 142 had wanted the honor of engaging Emden, but despite being a superior ship to Sydney was ordered to stand down and stay with the convoy. This was later celebrated by the Royal Australian Navy as the \\"samurai spirit of the Ibuki\\" whenever Imperial Japanese ships visited Australia in subsequent years. Fate After the war, Ibuki fell victim to the Washington Naval Treaty and was sold for scrap on 20 September 1923. Her guns were salvaged and used in shore batteries at Hakodate in Hokkaid≈ç and along the Tsugaru Strait separating Honsh≈´ and Hokkaid≈ç.

His father, Echu mac Muiredaig had been a king of the Ui Cheinnselaig. They belonged to a branch known as the U√≠ Felmeda descended from Fedelmid, son of √ânnae Cennsalach. His son √ìengus, grandson Muiredach, and great-grandson Eochu were all kings of the U√≠ Cheinnselaig.Francis J.Byrne, Irish Kings and High-Kings, Table 10 According to the Book of Leinster, Brandub succeeded √Åed Cerr mac Colm√°in M√°r (died 595) of the U√≠ D√∫nlainge as king of Leinster (actually √Åed Dibchine mac Senaig of the U√≠ M√°il)Book of Leinster gives Brandub a reign of 10 years. Birth saga In the Rawlinson B 502 manuscript, dated to c. 1130, is the poem Gein Branduib maic Echach ocus Aed√°in maic Gabr√°in (The Birth of Brandub son of Eochu and of Aed√°n son of Gabr√°n). This tells how √Åed√°n mac Gabr√°in of D√°l Riata was Brandub's twin brother, exchanged at birth for one of the twin daughters of Gabr√°n, born the very same night, so that each family might have a son. Whether the tale is entirely fabricated, or whether it echoes a foster-relationship between Brandub and √Åed√°n, can only be surmised. According to this story Brandub's father Echu had been expelled from the kingdom by F√°el√°n mac S√≠l√°in, his predecessor in the kingship of the U√≠ Chennselaig and had gone to live in D√°l Riata at the court of Gabr√°n where Brandub and Aed√°n were fostered together. Later Echu returned to be king and brought his son with him. Afterwards, when Aed√°n and Brandub were both rulers, Aed√°n made a claim to the kingship of Ireland and invaded Leinster.Dan M.Wiley, Birth of Brandub , The Cycles of the Kings Defence of Leinster The first mention of Brandub in the annals is as victor in the Battle of Mag Ochtair (Cloncerry, N.Kildare) over the Ui Neill in 590.Annals of Ulster AU 590.3; Annals of Tigernach AT 588.3 In 598 Brandub defeated the U√≠ N√©ill High King √Åed mac Ainmuirech of the Cen√©l Conaill at the Battle of D√∫n Bolg (Dunboyke, Wicklow Co.) and the high king was slain, stopping the southward expansion of the U√≠ N√©ill.Annals of Ulster AU 598.2; Annals of Tigernach AT 596.2 The Bor√∫ma Laigin (Cattle Tribute of Leinster) and the annals record that the war was caused by Brandub's killing of √Åed's son Cummascach in 597 at D√∫n Buchat.Annals of Ulster AU 597.1; Annals of Tigernach AT 595.1 The Bor√∫ma Laigin gives much detail of this event. Brandub had the assistance of Saint Aedan of Ferns (d. 632) who tried to obtain a truce for Brandub with the high-king. Aedan then devised a strategy of having the forces of Brandub hide in food baskets to sneak into the enemy camp. Aedan was granted Ferns after his battle for the assistance he had given Brandub. The saga also relates that the Ulaid were allied to Leinster and that the king of Airgialla was slain fighting for the high king.Dan M.Wiley Boroma, The Cycles of the Kings (archive link) According to later poems in the Book of Leinster, which record his \\"seven blows against Brega\\" (later ruled by the S√≠l n√Åedo Sl√°ine), he may also have reconquered lands lost to the U√≠ N√©ill in the midlands of Ireland.Byrne, pg.142 This is also mentioned in the annals dated to 599.Annals of Tigernach AT 599.1 Later U√≠ Cheinnselaig kings, such as Diarmait mac Mail na mBo and his grandson Diarmait mac Murchada, although descended from a different line, associated Brandub's successes with their branch of the clan.Byrne, pg.143 In 605 Brandub suffered a defeat at the Battle of Slaebre by the Ui Neill under the high king √Åed Uaridnach of the Cen√©l nE√≥gain. He was then assassinated by his own kinsman and son-in-law Sar√°n Saebderc.Annals of Ulster AU 605.1, 605.2; Annals of Tigernach AT 603.2, 603.3 Descendants The kindred of the Fir Thulach (in modern County Westmeath), subject to the Clann Cholm√°in in later times, traced their ancestry from Brandub, as did the U√≠ Felmeda (of modern County Carlow).Byrne, pg. 142‚Äì143 Notes References * Annals of Ulster at CELT: Corpus of Electronic Texts at University College Cork * Annals of Tigernach at CELT: Corpus of Electronic Texts at University College Cork * Byrne, Francis John (2001), Irish Kings and High-Kings, Dublin: Four Courts Press, * Book of Leinster,Rig Laigin at CELT: Corpus of Electronic Texts at University College Cork External links *CELT: Corpus of Electronic Texts at University College Cork includes: Gein Branduib (original & translation), Annals of Ulster, Annals of Tigernach, Annals of Innisfallen and others. *Boroma Laigin summary (archive link) 6th-century births 600s deaths Cycles of the Kings Kings of Leinster Kings of U√≠ Cheinnselaig 6th-century Irish monarchs 7th-century Irish monarchs ","title":"Brandub mac Echach"},{"id":"6457800","text":"Xiaocheng zhi chun () is the Chinese title of two films: *Spring in a Small Town (dir.

It is the second, stand-alone novel in a pair of novels (the first being Big Planet) that share the same setting, a backward, lawless, metal-poor world called Big Planet. The plot structure which involves a series of dramatic presentations, often with humorous consequences, has parallels with Vance's 1965 novel Space Opera. Plot summary Showboat World follows the farcical adventures of Apollon Zamp, owner of the showboat Miraldra's Enchantment, and his troupe of acrobats, magicians and actors. Zamp is invited by the King of Soyvanesse to travel up the river Vissel to the distant city of Mornune, there to participate in a contest. A rich prize awaits the showboat captain who stages the most spectacular performance and succeeds in entertaining the king. The mysterious, attractive Damsel Blanche-Aster accompanies him up the river for her own reasons. Zamp loses his ship through the machinations of his chief rival, Garth Ashgale, captain of the showboat Fironzelle's Golden Conceit. In order to take part in the competition, Zamp is forced to form an unlikely partnership with staid museum ship owner Throdorus Gassoon. Both men attempt to woo the unimpressed Damsel Blanche-Aster during the perilous journey. Along the way, the travellers encounter cultures and people with weird beliefs and unusual, often violent, customs. At least one scene was influenced by the Royal Nonesuch acting troupe episode in Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, while Showboat World itself has strongly influenced The Wizard of Karres (2004) by Mercedes Lackey, Eric Flint and Dave Freer. In addition, there are repeated references to Shakespeare's Macbeth, which is continuously adapted and readapted to the tastes of varying audiences. When they finally arrive at Mornune, Damsel Blanche-Aster reveals herself to be the rightful ruler, only to have her claim trumped by the unwitting Gassoon, when he appears in a decrepit costume that confers the throne on him. Gassoon marries the reluctantly acquiescent Blanche-Aster and richly rewards Zamp for his part in his elevation. Gassoon gives Zamp his boat, having no further use for it, and Zamp leaves with the boat and crew. When the costume falls apart, Gassoon flees with a bag of jewels and is able to catch up with the boat, which he reclaims. Both men are now wealthy‚ÄîZamp will build a new showboat while Gassoon will resume his role as proprietor of a museum boat.

Waste characterisation plays an important part in any treatment of waste which may occur. Developers of new waste technologies must take into account what exactly waste streams consist of in order to fully treat the waste. The biodegradable element of the waste stream is vitally important in the use of systems such as composting or anaerobic digestion. Waste characterization is a manual process carried beside waste management plants in a process that consists of taking 1 tone from a garbage truck, dividing the sample into 4 parts, mixing them, dividing again into 4 parts and take one of them (250kg) to analyze them manually. This is a process that takes around 3-4 hours to complete the characterization and generally involves 2-4 people. Even if this process is carried out very frequently (usually every 2 or 3 days), it is only a sample of the composition of the waste. Solid material waste is classified in material recovery facilities with mechanical tools (magnetic for metal, air pumps for plastic films, ramps for rolling objects, etc.) but, in fact, nobody knows exactly what each garbage truck contributes to the waste management plant. Municipal waste streams are commonly broken down into the following constituents: *Film plastic-LDPE *Dense plastic-HDPE, PET *Ferrous metal *Non-ferrous metals *Glass *Textiles *\\"Other\\" any remaining items which do not fit Biodegradable fraction *Glass *Paper & cardboard *Garden waste or green waste *Fines (items below a certain screen size) The European Waste Catalogue Overview The European Waste Catalogue (acronym EWC) refers to a set (although non- exhaustive) list of wastes that are derived from both households and businesses inside the European Union. The EWC is used to derive a code (six numbers in 3 sets of 2) that adequately describes the waste being transported, handled or treated. The EWC is used where Duty of Care Notices or Waste Transfer Notes are passed between waste management companies, waste carriers and to report volumes received or treated back to the governing agency (such as the Environment Agency in England and Wales, Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) in Scotland, Northern Ireland (NI) Environment Agency, etc.). Typical Waste Characterisation & reporting The first step in characterising waste is to decide on the appropriate EWC code. These codes carry three categories - absolute non-hazardous, mirror entries and absolute hazardous. Initial assessment for the majority of wastes follows a simple derivation of industry (some 20 main categories) from which they were originally obtained (Agricultural, wood working (furniture), Electronics, etc. ). Each Derived section (denoted by the first 2 sets of 2 numbers refers to a particular industry or sector). The final set of 2 numbers relates directly to the waste. Where a waste is hazardous by its very composition, the EWC is followed by an Asterix). Each member states Environment Agency throughout the European Union is obligated to adopt the EWC in its reporting methods and to enforce its use by the respective waste management sector. The lists are available through the European Commission's website. Submissions by Waste Management Companies to their respective Member states Environmental Agency are collated, in many instances by conversion to EWC STAT (European Waste Catalogue for Statistics) for submission to the EU, who oversees all member states and ensures compliance with unilaterally agreed standards and recycling rates. Absolute Hazardous Wastes Waste entries are hazardous, not due to the composition of the waste but by virtue of the process that produced it, the same is true for non-hazardous absolute entries. Mirror entries can either be hazardous or non-hazardous depending on the composition of the waste. Deciding whether a mirror entry is hazardous or non-hazardous by composition involves reference to the Approved Supply List (ASL) initially. If a substance is not listed in the ASL then the regulations permit the use of other sources such as Manufacturer's Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) to classify the waste. These documents contain Risk Phrases, which describe the hazards that the substance or substances present. Risk phrases have threshold values attached to them that indicate what concentration of a substance must be present in order for the waste to be classified as hazardous by the Hazard Code attached to the Risk Phrase.

The Santa Clara Aqueduct crosses the entire parish. Argivai is an urban area in P√≥voa de Varzim, Portugal. It is an ancient ecclesiastical parish and former civil parish located in the city of P√≥voa de Varzim. In the census of 2001, it had a population of 2,187 inhabitants and a total area of 2.32 km. A 2012 law merged the parish with neighbouring P√≥voa de Varzim (parish) and Beiriz, becoming the southern parish of the city of P√≥voa de Varzim, with a population of 34,266 inhabitants and a total area of 11.88 km. The name of the parish is of Germanic origin, from Argivadi, despite that, it is popularly known as Anjo (angel). History Former shield used during some periods while it was a civil parish. The parish of Argivai is, like many parishes of P√≥voa de Varzim, very ancient and its founding date is not known. it is known that it already existed in the 11th century. In its territory, a pre-Roman Castro settlement known by the default name of Castro de Argivai. This settlement was probably a Castro Culture farmhouse, as the main settlement per se, was located in Cividade de Terroso. In the modern period it was an ecclesiastical parish in the county of Barcelos. P√≥voa de Varzim itself, then Varazim, was a place in this ecclesiastical parish. And the first seat of the church of Argivai was located in Varzinha, which Pinho Leal argues is the modern P√≥voa de Varzim. During the middle ages, Varzim was a fief with a large territory, including Argivai, extending from the coast to the hills and the Este river, with the municipality of P√≥voa de Varzim being established in 1308. The lands outside the township were incorporated in the Lands of Faria, later incorporated in the county of Barcelos. With the urban enlargement of P√≥voa de Varzim and the town's growth (disputing it with Barcelos), Argivai was reduced in size in 1707. Its remaining territory was finally incorporated in the municipality of P√≥voa de Varzim in 1836, as the civil parish of Argivai. The civil parish was extinct and incorporated in the parish of P√≥voa de Varzim in 1842, but it was recovered by 1853. In 2012, it merged again with the central parish and Beiriz to create a larger parish P√≥voa de Varzim, Beiriz e Argivai. Geography The parish of Argivai is today very small and enclosed between the parish of P√≥voa de Varzim and the one of Vila do Conde. It is crossed by the Santa Clara Aqueduct, giving it a very pleasing outlook. The urban and transportation development destroyed much of its beautiful natural areas, including the traditional picnic areas that the Poveiros loved to go on Easter Monday, which lead the population to choose other locations on Anjo festival. A festival that even holds the name of the place.

He served as the tenth Prime Minister of Tuvalu from 2006 to 2010, and was returned as a member of parliament in the 2010 Tuvaluan general election. He was re-elected to parliament in the 2015 Tuvaluan general election. On 5 October 2016 Chief Justice Sweeney of the High Court of Tuvalu declared that Ielemia‚Äôs parliamentary seat was vacant as he was not qualified to be a member of parliament, as the consequence of the short time the opposition MP served time in jail following his conviction on 6 May 2016 in the Magistrate‚Äôs Court of charges of abuse of office during the final year of his term as Prime Minister (August 2006 to September 2010). The abuse of office charges related to payments deposited into a National Bank of Tuvalu personal account. The 5 October 2016 decision of the Chief Justice was controversial as it appeared to contradict the June 2016 decision of Justice Norman Franzi of the High Court of Tuvalu that had quashed Ielemia‚Äôs conviction and acquitted him of the abuse of office charges. The appeal to the High Court held that the conviction was ‚Äúmanifestly unsafe,‚Äù with the court quashing the 12-month jail term. In an application for leave to appeal his ruling, Chief Justice Charles Sweeney found: \\"When The Hon. Apisai Ielemia commenced to serve his sentence on 6 May 2016, he became a person who was then disqualified from being elected as a member of Parliament\\". The judge specified that if Ielemia had, in the context of his appeal, sought \\"an order staying his sentence of imprisonment [before] he had commenced to serve it\\", then his seat would not have become vacant, as he would not have been imprisoned.\\"Tuvalu demonstrate against top judge, former PM seeks re-election in Vaitupu seat\\", Pacific Islands News Association, 12 December 2016 Career Background Ielemia was elected to serve in the Parliament of Tuvalu by the constituency of Vaitupu on a non- partisan basis: his lack of alignment is not unusual in the politics of Tuvalu, since political parties have not emerged in the country. Prime Minister of Tuvalu with Yasuo Fukuda (at the Prime Minister's Official Residence on December 6, 2007) In general elections held on 3 August 2006 prime minister Maatia Toafa's government was defeated and Ielemia was elected by the new parliament on 14 August to become the new prime minister. He also became foreign minister. Ielemia continued Tuvalu's pursuit of close relations with the Republic of China, and in December 2007 visited that country, where various bilateral issues were addressed. He gained a higher international profile during the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen by highlighting the dangers of rising sea levels. In September 2008 Ielemia and the President of Kiribati, Anote Tong, attended a conference to improve relations with Cuba.\\"Cuba-Pacific ministerial meeting underway in Havana\\" ABC Radio Australia, 17 September 2008 =Prospects for stability= In a country which had in recent years seen frequent changes of government through the use of the parliamentary no confidence device, Ielemia's government, in office since 2006, seemed at the beginning of 2009 to offer somewhat of a rarity: the prospect of a government of Tuvalu running its full course. Prior to Ielemia's appointment as Prime Minister, the average length of Prime Ministerial terms of office had been considerably shorter; this history underscored the relative stability of his government, and by extension, the underlying parliamentary system which supported it. Ielemia was one of 10 MPs who were re-elected to parliament in the 2010 general election. =Ministry of Ielemia= As of September 2006, the government of Prime Minister Apisai Ielemia consisted of the following members: *Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Natural Resources: Hon.

However, on 15 December 2010 Prime Minister Maatia Toafa's government was ousted in a vote of no confidence and Willy Telavi was elected to the premiership by a slender majority in Parliament (8:7).

It is a small tetra growing to 5 cm in length. The species is a long established favourite aquarium fish, being introduced to the aquarium in 1932. Description The lemon tetra is one of the deeper-bodied tetras, contrasting with slender, torpedo-shaped relations such as the cardinal tetra and the rummy nosed tetra, whose approximate body shape when seen from the side is that of a lozenge,(often referred to as a diamond, is a form of rhombus). The basic body color of an adult specimen is a translucent yellow, with a pearlescent lustre emanating from the scales in particularly fine specimens. The dorsal and anal fin of the fish are marked with black and yellow: specifically, the anal fin is hyaline (glass-like appearance), with a black outer margin, the anterior three or four rays being an intense, acrylic lemon-yellow in hue, while the dorsal fin is principally black with a yellow central patch. The tail fin is mostly hyaline but in fine specimens (particularly alpha males) acquires a gunmetal-blue lustre. The pectoral fins are hyaline whilst the pelvic fins are translucent yellow, becoming more solidly and opaquely yellow with black posterior edges in fine specimens (again, alpha males are particularly notable in this regard). The eye is a notable feature of this fish, the upper half of the iris being an intense red, in some specimens almost gemstone-ruby in appearance. The colour of this part of the iris is an indicator of the health of the fish: if this red colouration fades, or worse still turns grey, then this is an indicator of serious disease in the fish. In common with many characins, the lemon tetra possesses an adipose fin. This fin may acquire a black border, particularly in males, though this is not a reliable characteristic. Black areas of colouration on adult fishes frequently acquire a glossy sheen, enhancing the beauty of the fish. Determining the gender of the fish is achieved in adult specimens by examining the black outer border of the anal fin. In female specimens, this consists of a fine black line, appearing almost as if drawn onto the fin with a fine pencil. In male specimens, particularly alpha males, the border is conspicuously wider, and in breeding alpha males, can cover up to a third of the total area of the anal fin. This is the only reliable means of differentiating gender in this species - while males frequently have taller and more pointed dorsal fins, some females also possess tall, pointed dorsal fins, and thus this characteristic is not reliable. Ripe females are fuller bodied, particularly when viewed from directly above, as the body cavity expands to accommodate the eggs forming within the female's reproductive tract. Juvenile fishes are usually translucent with only a hint of the colour of the adult. Additionally, the gender characteristics in juvenile fishes are not fully formed, so differentiating juveniles into male and female individuals is extremely difficult. Distribution The lemon tetra is an Amazon River fish species, first collected from the basin of the Rio Tapajos, near to Santar√©m, Brazil. The fish can be found in both the Rio Tapajos and stretches of the Amazon proper in this region (the Rio Tapajos joins the Amazon at Santar√©m). Habitat The lemon tetra inhabits clear waters with a modest to moderate current flow, remaining in shallower waters in close proximity to stands of aquatic plants. The water chemistry is slightly acidic, and the waters are relatively mineral-deficient. Lemon tetras congregate in their chosen waters in large shoals, numbering several thousand individuals, where the black and yellow colouration becomes disruptive from the standpoint of predatory fish species attempting to track an individual fish. The fishes are capable of moving at speed when required, and in a shoal the fishes will, when danger threatens, weave in and out of each other, adding to the visual confusion for a predator. The species preferentially occupies the middle and mid-lower water levels in the wild. Aquarium maintenance Lemon tetras fare best in a planted aquarium, where they should be kept as schooling fishes, allowing them to replicate their wild behaviour as closely as possible. A minimum of six individuals should be kept in an aquarium, though if space allows, a larger number is preferable, as the species exhibits a marked preference for grouping together in large shoals of its own kind where possible. In a planted aquarium, the Lemon Tetra displays more vivid colouration - juvenile specimens in bare dealer aquaria usually appear 'washed out' in appearance and do not show the full splendour of which this species is capable. The aquarium for this species should be furnished with plant thickets interspersed with open swimming areas where the fishes can display to each other. Suitable companions in an aquarium include other tetra species, small barbs, small danios, small rasboras, Corydoras and Otocinclus catfishes, and in aquaria where space allows, certain species of dwarf cichlid such as the smaller Apistogramma species. Tankmates should be chosen to be peaceful, not too large, and a more natural display results if the companion fishes chosen are other South American species. An aquarium containing large shoals of lemon and cardinal tetras makes a particularly stunning display, the blue and red of the Cardinals contrasting with the brilliant yellow and black of the lemons. While the preference of the lemon tetra with respect to water chemistry lies within the realm of soft (hardness less than 8¬∞ dH) and acidic (pH around 6.6) parameters, the species is notably hardy, and will accommodate itself to a wide range of conditions, the pH range for the fish being from 6.0 to 7.4. Temperature range for the species is 21 ¬∞C to 28 ¬∞C, though the species is capable of withstanding water temperatures up to 32 ¬∞C for considerable periods of time if the water is well oxygenated. Aeration and good quality filtration should be provided for this fish (and indeed for all aquarium fishes) though the fish is sufficiently hardy to cope with aquarium equipment failures provided these are attended to upon discovery. Extremes of high pH (8.0 or higher) and hardness should be avoided, as these will subject the Lemon Tetra to potentially life-threatening stress. Feeding the lemon tetra poses few problems for the aquarist, as the fish readily and eagerly devours all fish foods offered to it. For prime conditioning (especially if captive reproduction is to be attempted) live foods such as Daphnia should be offered. The lemon tetra is particularly fond of live bloodworms (these are the aquatic larvae of Chironomus midges) and will attack this particular food item with a relish that has to be witnessed to be fully appreciated! Prepared foods such as flakes, freeze dried Tubifex worms and similar fare are also devoured avidly. The lifespan of the lemon tetra in the aquarium can be as much as 8 years, though 6 years is a more typical figure. Reproduction Lemon tetras exhibit an interesting behaviour pattern in the aquarium, replicated by several other characin species, in which males will adopt 'landmarks' within the aquarium and use these as places from which to display as maturity approaches. Displays are principally performed between rival males, which position themselves in a slightly head-up posture, unpaired fins held erect to appear as large and as imposing as possible, and swim forwards with 'flicking' movements of the body. If two rival males approach closely, they will then begin to make passes at each other, which to the causal observer look like attacks: this is an entirely ritualised behaviour, best referred to as 'jousting', where the males make darting movements toward each other but pull away at the last moment. No damage is incurred by either contestant in these events, and evenly matched males that are at a similar level in the social hierarchy will continue such behaviour for 30 minutes or more at a time. This behaviour serves not only to establish the social rankings of the males, but also serves as an indicator of reproductive fitness to the watching females. In the wild, the lemon tetra is a communally spawning fish. Tens of thousands of pairs will spawn together, and choose thickets of fine-leaved aquatic plants as the repository for their fertilised eggs. This behaviour has several ramifications for captive reproduction, as will be duly noted. When ripe females are receptive, males will court them, after a chase sequence through aquatic foliage in which several males may pursue an individual female, breaking off to pursue a different female as the opportunity arises, resulting in the aquarium in mad dashes hither and thither. Eventually, close observation will see a male court a female in some secluded area of aquatic foliage. The courting gesture of the male consists of a quivering motion, with a head-down posture, and the 'flicking' of the unpaired fins in such a manner as to generate flashes of yellow colouration in the visual field of the female. These flashes will be readily visible to the observing aquarist. If the female is ready to spawn, then the pair will migrate to fine-leaved aquatic plants such as Cabomba or Java Moss, whereupon the pair will adopt a side-by-side position. The release of eggs and sperm is signalled by a quivering motion upon the part of both fishes, followed by an 'explosive' parting of the couple accompanied by the appearance of a cloud of eggs. The eggs are non-adhesive, and fall through the foliage, coming to rest either in thicker foliage at the base of the plants, or on the substrate. One of the problems presented to the aquarist by this species is that of egg-eating. In the wild, as has already been noted, tens of thousands of pairs spawn simultaneously, and in order to reduce the competition for their own offspring, a pair will turn around and eat some of the eggs being produced by neighbouring spawning pairs. The same instinct, needless to say, manifests itself in the aquarium, but in an aquarium setting, the only eggs present are usually those of the single spawning pair. Consequently, some of the pair's own eggs will be devoured. Special measures to reduce losses through this behaviour are therefore required if the aquarist is interested in obtaining as large a yield of fry as possible. Special 'egg traps' have been devised for the purpose - these may consist of evenly spaced glass rods in a frame, a layer of glass marbles on the aquarium bottom, or some other such device. The purpose of all these designs is the same - to allow eggs to fall through small gaps into a space where they will be beyond the reach of the adults, who are unable to pass through the same gaps. However, the speed of movement of the adult fishes is such that even with an 'egg trap' in place, a small percentage of eggs will still be eaten. A large adult female in prime condition may produce as many as 300 eggs. A breeding aquarium for the lemon tetra thus requires good quality filtration and aeration, fine leaved plants, and an 'egg trap' present to prevent large-scale losses because of the aforementioned parental instincts. Temperature should be slowly raised over a period of a few days to 28 ¬∞C, the pair conditioned with copious quantities of live foods if possible, and the aquarium should be sited so as to receive illumination by morning sunshine, as this is a well-documented spawning stimulus for the lemon tetra. Parent fishes should be removed from the breeding aquarium and returned to the main aquarium once spawning is complete. Sometimes, best results are obtained by using two males with one female. Development Fertile lemon tetra eggs take approximately 72 hours to hatch at 28 ¬∞C. The fry spend a further 24 to 48 hours absorbing the yolk sac, whereupon they become free- swimming. At this stage, the fry should be fed with infusoria or a special egglayer fry food, and frequent partial water changes (around 10% of the aquarium volume every 24 to 48 hours) initiated. After 7 days, the fry should be ready to feed upon newly hatched Brine Shrimp. The fry appear to be almost transparent at first, with the exception of the eyes, and do not begin to develop the 'lozenge' shape of the adult body until the differentiation of the finfold into the unpaired fins is complete (around 4‚Äì6 weeks). Once this process is complete, the fishes are ready to take sifted Daphnia. Maintenance temperature for the fry should be carefully and slowly reduced to around 25 ¬∞C once the fishes are thus recognisably miniature versions of the adults. The first signs of black colouration on the unpaired fins may take a further two weeks of more to being manifesting themselves, and it will not be until the fishes are at least 12 weeks old that they will fully represent miniature versions of the parents. Even at this stage, the black colouration of the unpaired fins will be incompletely developed, and it will not be until sexual maturity is achieved (approximately 8 to 9 months after hatching) that the black border on the anal fin will become a reliable gender differentiation characteristic.

The exposition, held for 100 days each year on immediately south of Central Park, which is now the St. James-Belgravia Historic District, was essentially an industrial and mercantile show. At the time, the exposition was larger than any previous American exhibition with the exception of the Centennial Exposition held in Philadelphia in 1876. U.S. President Chester A. Arthur opened the first annual exposition on August 1, 1883.  Highlights  One highlight of the show was the largest to-date installation of incandescent light bulbs, having been recently invented by Thomas Edison (a resident of Louisville sixteen years before), to bring light to the exposition in the nighttime. The contract with the Louisville Board of Trade was for 5,000 incandescent lamps. 4,600 lamps for the exhibition hall and 400 for an art gallery, more than all the lamps installed in New York City at that time, were used.

CNN reported that Harrington recorded: :...an FBI agent was present in an observation room while an interrogation of a detainee was under way. A \\"Sgt.

Lacey had grabbed the detainee's thumbs and bent them backwards and indicated that she also grabbed his genitals. The Marine also implied that her treatment of that detainee was less harsh than her treatment of others by indicating that he had seen her treatment of other detainees result in detainees curling into a fetal position on the floor and crying in pain,\\" Harrington's memo highlighted four examples of abuse. Three of these incidents occurred while Geoffrey Miller had overall authority over the detainees.

David Davies, 1st Baron Davies (11 May 1880 - 16 June 1944) was a Welsh Liberal politician and public benefactor who was MP for Montgomeryshire from 1906‚Äì29. He was a grandson of the great Welsh industrialist David Davies. As a philanthropist, he established the King Edward VII Welsh National Memorial to combat tuberculosis in Wales, as well as the Wilson Chair of International Politics at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth. Early life and education Davies was born in Llandinam, Montgomeryshire, the first child of Edward Davies and May Jones. His father was the only son of David Davies, often known as David Davies Llandinam, was the greatest Welsh industrialist of the Victorian era, having made his fortune in the coal mines. He was educated at Merchiston Castle School and King's College, Cambridge, graduating in 1903. His family's wealth allowed the young Davies to travel extensively to exotic locations, where he enjoyed game hunting. He visited Africa, Asia and the United States, including Alaska. His two younger sisters, Gwendoline and Margaret, became renowned patrons of the arts. Career Politically and personally, Davies followed the lead set by his grandfather. In 1906, at just 26, he was elected the Liberal Member of Parliament for the Montgomeryshire constituency. In the First World War, he commanded the 14th Battalion of the Royal Welsh Fusiliers until 1916, when he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to David Lloyd George. Following the war, Davies became an active supporter of the League of Nations. In 1929, Davies stood down prior to the general election to focus on international affairs. Despite this, Davies continued to support the official Liberal Party. He became President of Montgomeryshire Liberal Association and was at odds with his successor as MP, Clement Davies. In 1931, Clement Davies became a Liberal National and continued to support the National Government after the official Liberal Party moved into opposition in 1933. In 1932, he established the New Commonwealth Society for \\"the promotion of international law and order,\\" writing several books on the right use of force, notably The Problem of the Twentieth Century (1930), which was translated into German and other languages. His ideas influenced the writing of the United Nations Charter, especially with regards to sanctions and the transition of national armies to an international police. On 24 June 1932, he was created Baron Davies of Llandinam, in the County of Montgomery, for public services. In 1938, with a general election likely to occur in the near future, Lord Davies put pressure on Clement Davies by persuading the Montgomeryshire executive to seek clarification from their MP on his views regarding the National Government and appeasement. The MP shortly after opposed appeasement and resigned the Liberal National whip. Philanthropy Like his sisters, Davies was a significant philanthropist who donated to a number of good causes both locally and nationally. In 1910, he contributed ¬£150,000 (¬£ as of ) to the King Edward VII Welsh National Memorial, which was formed with the aim of eradicating tuberculosis in Wales. He endowed perhaps the world's first Chair in International Politics, established in honour of Woodrow Wilson in 1919 at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, which also hosts the David Davies Memorial Institute of International Studies. He was also the president of the National Library of Wales. Davies was the brainchild and leading funder of the Welsh Temple of Peace in Cardiff pledging ¬£58,000 in 1934 (¬£ as of ) towards the erection of a building. Family and issue In 1910, Davies married firstly Amy Penman, daughter of Lancelot Tulip Penman of Broadwood Park, and had two sons: * Maj. David Michael Davies, 2nd Baron Davies (16 January 1915 ‚Äì 25 September 1944) married Ruth Eldrydd Dugdale, daughter of Maj.

The scan revealed advanced cancer from which he died from a few months later in June 1944. His eldest son and heir, Major Hon. David Michael Davies, was serving in the Royal Welsh Fusiliers and was killed in action in September 1944, a few months after succeeding to the title. His eldest son succeeded as the third Baron Davies, days prior to his fourth birthday. A statue commissioned in honour of his Grandfather stands in Llandinam in Powys on the A470.

Individual celebrations have become increasingly complex over time, from simple \\"spiking\\" of the football in decades past to the elaborately choreographed displays of the current era. NFL football Taunting and celebration are both offenses in the National Football League; as a result, gaudy displays are often frowned upon. If the league views the act as highly offensive, large fines and even suspensions can be issued. In 2006 the NFL, in an effort to cut down on celebrations, amended its rules to include an automatic 15-yard penalty against any player who left his feet or uses a prop, like a towel, the goal post or post base or more specifically the football. The penalty was called as \\"excessive celebration\\", and the yardage was charged against the offending player's team when that team kicked off to the opposing team. The excessive celebration rule was severely scaled back in 2017; penalties for excessive celebration will henceforth only be called for using the goalposts as a prop (to avoid inadvertently warping the goalposts out of place), lewd or violent gestures, or prolonged celebrations intended to delay the game. Other restrictions still in place include the usage of outside props and any person not on the active roster for that game leaving the team box to celebrate (including inactive players or coaches); the penalty was also revised in 2019 to give the defensive team the option of enforcing the penalty on the extra point attempt, which could potentially push an extra point kick out to 48 yards and make it far less certain to be converted.https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/08/29/celebration-fouls- may-complicate-the-post-touchdown-try/ Simply spiking the ball is not interpreted as excessive celebration unless the ball is spiked towards another player on the opposing team. Jumping onto the outer wall to accept contact from fans, such as the Lambeau Leap, is also not considered such, as it is off the field of play. NCAA football College football, governed by the NCAA also penalizes excessive celebrations with a 15-yard penalty. NCAA Football Rule 9-2, Article 1(a)(1)(d) prohibits \\"Any delayed, excessive, prolonged or choreographed act by which a player (or players) attempts to focus attention upon himself (or themselves)\\"; in addition, Rule 9-2, Article 1(a)(2) asserts that \\"After a score or any other play, the player in possession immediately must return the ball to an official or leave it near the dead-ball spot.\\"2008 NCAA FOOTBALL RULES AND INTERPRETATIONS , National Collegiate Athletic Association, Page 112, Accessed August 4, 2008. Additionally, if a player's actions are considered \\"unsportsmanlike conduct\\" the result is dead-ball foul; a \\"flagrant unsportsmanlike conduct\\" foul requires player ejection. If a player‚Äôs nonfootball-related act (e.g. taunting or cursing) causes an opponent to physically retaliate, it is considered fighting and both players are ejected.Unsportsmanlike vs. Personal Fouls, 2007 NCAA Football Guide, Page 3, Accessed August 4, 2008. Arena football The rules for celebrations in the Arena Football League were the same as the NFL; no props were allowed. However, choreographed or group dances were often seen after a score. AAF In the Alliance of American Football, it was an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty to propel the ball out of the field of play during a touchdown celebration. This \\"no souvenirs\\" rule was in place so that the AAF would not lose possession of the electronic tracking apparatus embedded in each ball. CFL football Player celebrations The Canadian Football League is much more lenient than the NFL when it comes to touchdown dances. It often has very small, if any, penalties handed out to players who celebrate excessively. CFL end zone celebrations often include more than one player, often a whole wide receiving corps of 4-6 players. Past celebrations have included five Calgary Stampeders receivers holding out their hands and mimicking the pouring of drinks from a champagne bottle, then stumbling around as if drunk; another end-zone routine simulated a bobsleigh run when receiver Jeremaine Copeland sat down and wrapped his legs around the goal-line pylon with the rest of the receiving corps tucked in behind him. The same group also pantomimed a four- seater stationary bicycle, which all players played a role for the bicycle. Edmonton Eskimos punt returner Henry \\"Gizmo\\" Williams celebrated punt return touchdowns by doing a backflip in the end zone. The Winnipeg Blue Bombers have a celebration whereby players form a circle, toss a football into the air in the center of the circle and then fall directly backwards in unison when the ball lands on the ground as if a hand grenade has exploded. In the 2008 CFL season, the Winnipeg receiving corps did a few celebrations, most notably a version of Duck, Duck, Goose, as well as a walking race across the end zone.Video of touch down celebration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aavPl9AfqE In the 2009 CFL season, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats did a memorable celebration in Winnipeg, as a fishing boat was at the edge of the end zone. Hamilton scored two touchdowns within a minute, both times got into the boat and celebrating as though they were fishing, literally showboating. During the August 14, 2010, a celebration by the Toronto Argonauts in which several players mimicked a rowing crew drew an Objectionable Conduct penalty. In the 2018 CFL season, Ottawa Redblacks offensive lineman Jon Gott chugged a beer after teammate Mossis Madu scored a touchdown during the final game of the regular season against the Toronto Argonauts. Although Gott was not penalized, fined or suspended for the action due to the league relaxing its rules on touchdown celebrations, the CFL subsequently revised their policy to prohibit the use of alcohol or drugs or the mimicking thereof. Stadium celebrations Long-standing tradition at McMahon Stadium has a horse run the length of the stadium with a team flag each time the hometown Calgary Stampeders scores a touchdown.Stampeders homepage The Montreal Alouettes' touchdown celebration is pretty similar; it features a man carrying an Alouettes flag and running across the field every time the Alouettes score six points at Percival Molson Memorial Stadium. Other stadiums have developed similar traditions. The Winnipeg Blue Bombers have a small airplane (known as the \\"touchdown plane\\") while the Saskatchewan Roughriders fire smoke mortars from behind the goalposts in celebration of home team touchdowns. The Edmonton Eskimos have a fire engine circle the field after each touchdown, throwing souvenirs into the crowd. Memorable celebrations * The \\"touchdown spike\\": New York Giants wide receiver Homer Jones is credited as the first player to throw the ball into the field at his feet after scoring a touchdown. He first did this move in 1965, calling it a \\"spike\\", and it is said to be the origin of post-touchdown celebrations. * In 1969, Elmo Wright, a junior wide receiver for the University of Houston, began celebrating his touchdown receptions with a 'celebratory' end zone dance. In his rookie year with the Kansas City Chiefs, he caught a touchdown pass in a game on Oct. 24, 1971, against the Washington Redskins and celebrated with what some believe was the first end zone dance in NFL history. *The 1980s Washington Redskins \\"The Fun Bunch\\": The 1983 Washington Redskins raised the bar on celebrations by performing a group high-five after scoring. The NFL had made previous attempts to curb celebrations but, after the 1983 Fun Bunch, they changed the rules and \\"excessive celebration\\" was disallowed. This is one of the few offensive squads that have managed to acquire a nickname. *In his rookie season of 1988, Cincinnati Bengals running back Ickey Woods gained media attention with a touchdown dance that became known as the \\"Ickey Shuffle.\\" *Animals of all different sorts can lend their names to touchdown dances. Baltimore Ravens wide receiver Kelley Washington is known for his distinctive touchdown celebration dubbed \\"The Squirrel\\" (which originated with his former team the Cincinnati Bengals). Former Detroit Lions and Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Johnnie Morton liked to celebrate with \\"The Worm.\\" And during his tenure with the San Francisco 49ers, defensive back Merton Hanks became famous for his unique \\"Funky Chicken\\" dance after scoring on interception returns. *On December 15, 2003, at a game between the New York Giants and the New Orleans Saints, after his second touchdown, Saints wide receiver Joe Horn pulled a cell phone out from under the padding on the goalpost, and pretended to make a call. Unsportsmanlike conduct was called on Horn, and he was fined $30,000 by the NFL as a result. *On September 26, 2010, Buffalo Bills wide receiver Stevie Johnson imitated a minuteman firing a musket and then falling backwards pretending to be shot at Gillette Stadium after scoring a fourth-quarter touchdown against the New England Patriots, for which he received a $10,000 fine. In a Week 11 win over the Cincinnati Bengals, after scoring his first touchdown, Johnson lifted his jersey to reveal the question \\"Why so serious?\\" written on his T-shirt (a quote made famous by The Joker in the Batman movie sequel The Dark Knight ), which was directed at Bengals wide receivers Terrell Owens and Chad Ochocinco, who referred to themselves as Batman and Robin., and Johnson was fined $5,000 by the league office for the celebration. *During the 2010 and 2011 seasons, Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers performed the \\"championship belt\\" move after touchdowns, imitating putting on a boxing or wrestling championship belt. After the Packers won Super Bowl XLV, Rodgers was presented with a replica Big Gold Belt by teammates, and in the following weeks, during a scheduled WWE Raw telecast, the Packers were honored with title belts from the WWE itself. In a series of State Farm commercials that aired during the 2011 season, Rodgers and a State Farm representative argued whether the move was a touchdown dance or the \\"discount double check\\" dance to celebrate saving money on insurance. *Rob Gronkowski has been credited in resurrecting the spiking as a touchdown celebration and making it his own. His signature Gronk Spike has been a product of the less restrictive scoring celebrations of the NFL compared to high school and college, and debuted on September 26, 2010 after scoring his second NFL touchdown. It had become a fan phenomenon with MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference calculating that Gronkowski's arm moves 130¬∞ with the football leaving his hand at 60-miles per hour delivering 650 lbs of force. *On October 21, 2012, Mike Tolbert of the Carolina Panthers and Stevie Johnson of the Buffalo Bills did the Gangnam Style dance in their Week 7 games. *A November 21, 2013, matchup at the Georgia Dome between division rivals the New Orleans Saints and Atlanta Falcons was halted for several minutes when Saints tight end Jimmy Graham celebrated a touchdown score with a goalpost \\"dunk\\" where he pulled the left side of the standard down, forcing a delay while field maintenance crews brought the posts back level using a bubble level and rubber band. The practice of dunking over the goalposts was subsequently made into a penalty due to this delay. *On December 21, 2014 at State Farm Stadium in Arizona, Marshawn Lynch jumped and grabbed his crotch as he crossed the goalline. He was fined $11,050.https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/marshawn-lynch-fined-for-obscene- gesture-at-end-of-td-run/ *In Super Bowl XLIX, Doug Baldwin scored what turned out to be the Seattle Seahawks' last touchdown of the season as they failed to repeat as Super Bowl champions. Baldwin celebrated the touchdown with a vulgar pantomime which gained significant attention on social media as the \\"poopdown\\", and which earned a 15-yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct. He commented after the game that the celebration was directed at an unnamed group, who were not present at the game. He was later fined $11,025 for his actions by the NFL. *On December 6, 2015, at Heinz Field, Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown charged into the goalpost pylon after returning a punt for 71 yards for a touchdown against the Indianapolis Colts. He was penalized 15 yards for \\"using the goalpost as a prop\\" and later fined $11,576 by the NFL. Effect on game play It has been argued that celebration penalties have affected the outcomes of games. The September 6, 2008, game between Washington and BYU saw the Washington quarterback, Jake Locker, score a touchdown, putting Washington within one point with two seconds to go. Upon entering the endzone, however, Locker threw the ball high in the air. His team was penalized, the referee applying NCAA Rule 9-2, Article 1(a)(2), which states that \\"after a score or any other play, the player in possession immediately must return the ball to an official or leave it near the dead-ball spot,\\" paragraph (c) of which forbids \\"throwing the ball high into the air.\\" BYU blocked the ensuing 38-yard extra point attempt and won the game. On December 30, 2010, Kansas State's Adrian Hillburn scored a 30-yard touchdown catch with 1:08 left in the 2010 New Era Pinstripe Bowl against Syracuse, narrowing the score to 36-34. He subsequently saluted the crowd in a quick military fashion and was flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct. The penalty pushed Kansas State's 2-point conversion attempt (to tie the game and possibly force it into overtime) back to the 18-yard line. Kansas State then missed the 2-point conversion, and Syracuse went on to win the game.

The submarine was laid down on 26 November 1941 at the Deutsche Werft yard in Hamburg as yard number 344, launched on 15 July 1942, and commissioned on 30 September 1942 under the command of Kapit√§nleutnant Georg-Werner Fraatz. After training with the 4th U-boat Flotilla, U-529 was transferred to the 10th flotilla for front-line service on 1 February 1943. Design German Type IXC/40 submarines were slightly larger than the original Type IXCs. U-529 had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged.

When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . U-529 was fitted with six torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and two at the stern), 22 torpedoes, one SK C/32 naval gun, 180 rounds, and a SK C/30 as well as a C/30 anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of forty-eight. Service history U-529 sailed from Kiel on her first and only war patrol on 30 January 1943. The U-boat was sunk with all hands on 15 February 1943 in the North Atlantic, in position , by depth charges from a British B-24 Liberator aircraft from No. 201 Squadron RAF. She was originally listed as missing, assumed lost at sea, as the Liberator attack of 15 February was believed to have sunk .

On 21 November 2002 he was again elected Mayor and served until 4 December 2006. His achievements are however widely criticized and he is blamed for the compensation of over 10 million zlotys, which the city must pay for canceling the land selling deal, his lack of formal education, and his apparent cluelessness in many important matters. Jurczyk's famous errors include forgetting the name of the deputy he had just nominated or quoting Jesus in a speech to the council. Because of this criticism recall voices of recall were raised. On 23 March 2004 the necessary 32,000 signatures were received by the Recall Committee. A Recall referendum took place on 23 May 2004. However the necessary 30% turnout wasn't reached as only 19% of voters cast their ballots, though an overwhelming majority of those voting (92%) supported the mayor's recall.

About the song According to a studio report in Star Hits magazine, one of the early drafts of this song was called \\"One of the Faithful.\\" A demo version by that name can be found on several bootlegs. The album version of the song is considerably different from the single and video versions, and from all the remixes. The former's original key and tempo are maintained, but mixes elements of the master to differing degrees for the single release, the main ones being a more emphatic, up-front mix for the percussion, brass, and backing vocal tracks, throughout the song. Duran Duran played this song‚Äîamong others‚Äîlive, on the final episode of British music show The Tube. Music video \\"Meet El Presidente\\" was the third video directed for Duran Duran by Peter Kagan and Paula Greif. It was a basic concert video, featuring the band in their stagewear from the Strange Behaviour tour which supported the release of the Notorious album. It was also filmed in black and white Super-8. B-sides, bonus tracks and remixes \\"Meet El Presidente\\" was backed by album track \\"Vertigo (Do The Demolition)\\". This was the second single from Notorious to have an album track as b-side.

Retrieved 29 December 2006. Making his YouTube debut in August 2006 with Telling it all, a series of five-to-ten minute autobiographical videos, Oakley gained popularity with a wide section of the YouTube community. Amongst the autobiographical details revealed in his videos are that he served as a radar mechanic during World War II, that he had a lifelong love of motorcycles, and that he lived alone as a widower and pensioner. His unforeseen rise was widely reported by international media outlets and online news sources and blogs.Pensioner tops web video clips Alex Kumi, The Guardian, 14 August 2006 After resisting all media attention for a long time (including requests for interviews, photographs, and attempts to identify him), insisting that he only wished to converse with the YouTube community in an informal and personal way, Oakley finally gave his first interview, for the BBC's The Money Programme, which was aired on BBC Two on 16 February 2007. By mid-2006, Oakley was the most subscribed user on YouTube. His rise to the #1 position took place in just over a week. In the process, he displaced users who had been around since the site's launch, including NBC-signed Brooke Brodack. In November that year, he had 30,000 subscribers. Oakley also holds the record for being the first user on YouTube to reach the milestone of 25,000 subscribers. He uploaded 434 videos between 2006 and 2014 covering several topics from childhood memories to setting up a Google account. Oakley was later diagnosed with cancer which was too far advanced for treatment. He posted his final video on 12 February 2014 and died a month later on the morning of 23 March 2014. Telling It All After Oakley's introductory video, \\"first try\\", which has been viewed over three million times, he began producing his autobiographical series, Telling It All. These made him an Internet celebrity almost overnight, gaining mention in various media, such as BBC News and GMTV, as well as prompting the creation of websites bearing his username. In Telling it all 7, Oakley repudiated those sites, saying he was in no way affiliated with them and had no say or control over their content. In the series, Oakley describes some of the major events and periods of his life, including *Growing up during World War II, and living as a young teen in Norwich, posting 29 November 2013 which was bombed by the Luftwaffe. *His experience in the primary and secondary education system of England in the 1930s, and his fortunate (in his eyes) selection to have his education 'extended' past the age of 14, a privilege during the period reserved for children deemed to be intelligent. *His conscription into the British Army, and again his fortunate selection to be a radar technician, which occurred as a consequence of the aptitudes his superiors detected in him. This role kept him out of combat, for which he was grateful because he did not have to witness \\"the horrors of war\\", but was nonetheless imperative for the war effort. *His return to civilian life and the job he had left behind. *A period of tertiary education in Leicester, England, where he met his future wife and developed his passion for motorcycling. *His employment in Leicester as a public-health inspector. In early 2010, entertainer Al Chantrey‚Äîa friend of Oakley's and a fellow YouTube user‚Äîwrote and recorded a song for him which Oakley featured in several videos. The song, entitled 'Telling It All' (based on Oakley's video series) talks about Oakley's life. On 5 March 2014 Chantrey posted the song on his own channel on YouTube, accompanied by video footage of Peter as a tribute following the announcement of his illness. Oakley was featured in an installment of Yahoo! Current Buzz (which chronicles the top searches on the Internet), entitled \\"Retired and Wired\\". Influence Oakley's YouTube success inspired other older people, particularly men with life experiences to share, to begin posting vlogs on it. Jonathan King credits him for starting his YouTube videos in 2006. Oakley influenced World War II veteran Martin H. Slobodkin (1920‚Äì2006), who, under the name MHarris1920, started to post his own blogs. Martin died in October 2006, and received an outpouring of tributes from other YouTube users after his wife, Teresa, posted a video announcing his death. His widow temporarily took over his blogs, but later closed this account. Another older person is Bernhard von Schwerin, who appears under the name bernie1927. He too was a World War II veteran, but on the German side. He was encouraged by Oakley, and has talked about his youth and his many travels, and his emigration to the U.S. in 1951. Artist Annemarie Wright was so inspired by Oakley's story that she dedicated a piece of artwork to him. The image is of Oakley to the lyrics of The Zimmers' version of \\"My Generation\\". Media On 17 August 2006, Oakley uploaded \\"Telling it all 7\\", in which he made a statement about how much attention he had received from the media over the previous days. He mentioned that this was not what he sought or wanted. He also stated that any web sites using his username (geriatric1927) were in no way affiliated with him.Telling it all 7 - Something important to say youtube posting 17 August 2006 In \\"Telling it all 7\\", he stated that he had received many messages from advertising companies, telephone companies, and newspaper companies that wanted to interview him, but he preferred to speak only to his fellow YouTubers, whom he considered his friends. On 16 February 2007, Oakley made his first television appearance, on a special episode of the BBC's The Money Programme called \\"Coming to Your Screen: DIY TV\\". The program was taped in the autumn of 2006. He also featured in a radio interview for the BBC World Service. In March 2007, Oakley announced that he was working on some television programmes about silver surfing. Oakley was part of a BBC documentary in which he was recruited as one of The Zimmers, a group of pensioners whom the documentary maker Tim Samuels brought together to sing The Who's classic \\"My Generation\\" to highlight the plight of pensioners in modern Britain. The single was released in May 2007 to raise money for the charity Age Concern. As part of The Zimmers, Oakley recorded a version of the Alan Parsons Project's song \\"Old and Wise\\". His work with the band took him to Washington, D.C. in September 2007, as a guest of the AARP.

It was first released in 1965 on the Help! album in the United Kingdom and on the Rubber Soul album in the United States. Recording The Beatles recorded \\"It's Only Love\\" at EMI Studios in London on 15 June 1965. Lennon's working title for the composition was \\"That's a Nice Hat\\". The band recorded six takes of the rhythm track, two of which were incomplete, with a line-up of 6- and 12-string acoustic guitars, bass and drums. The high register of the acoustic guitars was created through Lennon and George Harrison each using a capo on the neck of their instrument. Lennon overdubbed his vocals onto the final take, and Harrison recorded lead guitar parts, including one with a heavy tremolo effect. According to musicologist Walter Everett's description of the recording, Harrison played all three of the electric guitar parts, including one that doubles the main riff on a Rickenbacker 12-string. Author Ian MacDonald cites the varied sound treatment applied to Lennon's vocals and Harrison's guitars as an example of the Beatles' increasingly experimental approach to production during the Help! period. Take 2 of \\"It's Only Love\\" was included on the Anthology 2 compilation in 1996, with a false start (the incomplete take 3) edited onto the beginning of the track. Reception Lennon was highly critical of \\"It's Only Love\\", describing it as a \\"lousy song\\" with \\"abysmal lyrics\\". In MacDonald's opinion, the song is a \\"twee make- weight\\" that, while \\"slightly redeemed by the vigorous chorus\\", features the \\"hollowest\\" lyrics of Lennon's career. Journalist Mark Hertsgaard says that although the song falls short of the high standard of Lennon's Help! track \\"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\\", his dismissal of \\"It's Only Love\\" was overly harsh and fails to do justice to its \\"lovely lilting melody\\". In his review of Help! for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine considers \\"It's Only Love\\" to be one of the rare \\"minor numbers\\" on an album where Lennon dominates the songwriting with \\"great\\" contributions such as \\"Ticket to Ride\\", the title track and \\"You're Going To Lose That Girl\\". Personnel According to Ian MacDonald, except where noted: *John Lennon - double-tracked lead vocal, 12-string acoustic guitar *Paul McCartney - bass guitar *George Harrison - acoustic guitar, lead guitars *Ringo Starr - drums, tambourine Cover versions *The song became a chart hit in the fall of 1981 when it was recorded by Gary U.S. Bonds. His rendition reached No. 43 on the UK Singles Chart.

Osmond Carr, was an English composer who wrote the music for several Victorian burlesques before turning to the new genere of Edwardian musical comedy, and also composing some comic operas. He often worked with the lyricist Adrian Ross, and several of his pieces were created for the producer George Edwardes. Life and career Carr was born in Bradford, Yorkshire, England.F. Osmond Carr profile, at the British Musical Theatre website of The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive (2004) His parents were George Saxton Carr, a schoolmaster and Margaret Durden Carr, n√©e Painter.Lamb, Andrew. \\"Carr, Frank Osmond (1858‚Äì1916)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 7 Oct 2008, He attended New College, Oxford, and Downing College, Cambridge, receiving a B.A. degree in 1883 and apparently returning to Oxford to receive a music degree there in 1884. He continued his studies at Trinity College, Cambridge, earning a Cambridge M.A. and B.Mus. in 1886 and gained a doctorate in music at Oxford in 1891. Jessie Bond in Carr's His Excellency Carr's first produced work (with lyricist Adrian Ross) was the burlesque Faddimir, or the Triumph of Orthodoxy at the Vaudeville Theatre in London in 1889, which gained the attention of producer George Edwardes. Edwardes began to commission songs from Carr and Ross, including a song for his next Gaiety Theatre burlesque Ruy Blas and the Blas√© Rou√©. They next wrote the score for a burlesque of Joan of Arc, or, The merry maid of Orleans (1891), and then the songs for what many historians consider the first British musical comedy, In Town (1892). Carr also composed another burlesque that year, Blue Eyed Susan, for the Prince of Wales Theatre. Carr next composed two successful musicals for producer Fred Harris: Morocco Bound (1893), a model for the music-hall-influenced \\"variety musicals\\" to come, and Go-Bang (1894), both with lyrics by Ross. 1n 1894, Edwardes engaged Carr to write the music for His Excellency, a comic opera with a libretto by W. S. Gilbert. This was a moderate success and enjoyed international productions. Carr's musicals in the late 1890s, included Billy (1895), My Girl (1896 with Ross), Biarritz (1896 with Ross and Jerome K Jerome), a vehicle for Little Tich called Lord Tom Noddy (1896, with George Dance), Thrillby to a book by Joseph W. Herbert (1897) and The Maid of Athens (1897, produced by Carr). All were unsuccessful, although a number of individual songs from these musicals became popular, and some toured the British provinces. Carr's post-1900 pieces included The Southern Belle (1901), The Rose of the Riviera (1903), Miss Mischief (1904) and The Scottish Bluebells (1906), all of which had at least a provincial success, but he never regained his early popularity. Carr also wrote many separate songs and some instrumental pieces. He also produced the score for a ballet produced at the Empire Theatre in 1907 called Sir Roger de Coverley. He retired to the country in 1916 but almost immediately died of a heart attack in Uxbridge, Middlesex, England, at the age of 58. Notes References *G√§nzl, Kurt.

One of many small tetras belonging to the same genus, it is on average 5 cm (2 in) long when fully grown, and is a long established favourite among tropical fishkeepers. The fish is one of several very similar species including Hemigrammus bleheri, and Petitella georgiae, and it is possible that more recently collected specimens available in the aquarium trade are members of one or other of these similar species. The common name applied to most of these fishes is \\"rummy-nose tetra\\", though other common names are in circulation (such as \\"firehead tetra\\" for H. bleheri, according to FishBase). Physical description The rummy-nose tetra is fusiform in shape, whose basal body colour is a translucent silvery colour suffused in some specimens with a greenish tint: iridescent green scales are frequently seen adorning the fish at the point where the fontanel meets the body. The fins are hyaline, with the exception of the caudal fin. This fin being adorned with black and white horizontal stripes, variable in number, but usually comprising one central black stripe in the central portion of the tail fin, with two horizontal black stripes upon each caudal fin lobe, the spaces between the stripes being white, the total count of black stripes being five. The head is a deep red colour, iridescent in lustre, with the red continuing into the iris of the eye, and some red colouration extends beyond the operculum into the anterior-most section of the body proper. Some specimens classified as Hemigrammus rhodostomus possess three black tail stripes instead of five, and some specimens classified as Petitella georgiae have a black stripe in the caudal peduncle extending forwards into the body, surmounted above by a thin iridescent gold line: however, whether these features are reliable determinants of species identity has yet to be fully ascertained. Male and female individuals exhibit no obvious visual differences, other than increased fullness of the body outline in ripe females. Distribution Hemigrammus bleheri The three different species of fish thus known as rummy- nose tetras have the following distributions: :Hemigrammus rhodostomus : Brazil and Venezuela, in the lower Amazon basin in Par√° State and Orinoco River. First described by Ahl, 1924. :Hemigrammus bleheri: Rio Negro and Rio Meta basins (photo shown here is that of a group of H. bleheri which was discovered by Heiko Bleher in 1965) :Petitella georgiae: Upper Amazon basin in Peru, Rio Purus, Rio Negro and Rio Madeira basins (which has been found in an aquarium fish import from Peru in the late 1950s in Switzerland by H. Boutiere). Habitat All three species of rummy-nose tetra inhabit river stretches whose water chemistry is mineral-deficient (soft), acidic, and frequently tainted with humic acid decay products from leaf litter upon the river substrates (known as 'blackwaters' because of their appearance). Aquatic plants are sometimes present in these stretches of water, though the upper reaches of the Rio Negro are less densely populated with aquatic flora than the other rivers due to shading from the rainforest canopy. The fishes preferentially inhabit the middle and mid-lower water regions. Aquarium maintenance The details of aquarium maintenance for all three species are more or less identical: the rummy-nose tetra is a schooling fish, which exhibits tight schooling behaviour both in the wild and in the aquarium. Consequently, these fishes should be maintained in groups of no fewer than six individuals, with larger numbers being preferable where space permits-these tetras preferring about a 25 gallon/80 litre aquarium. All three species are lovers of warm aquarium water, the temperature range for maintenance being 24 ¬∞C to 31 ¬∞C, with the fishes sometimes requiring temperatures as high as 33 ¬∞C for breeding. Consequently, compatibility of these fishes with cooler water fishes is contra-indicated: for example, panda corydoras would be a bad choice of companion as these fishes prefer lower temperatures, and there is little overlap in the temperature ranges of the two species. Many fish can be kept with rummy-nose tetras, some including smaller gourami, tetras, barbs, danios, Australian rainbows, and various catfish, such as Ancistrus. The rummy-nose tetra cannot be kept with other popular ornamental fishes, such as African cichlids, as they occupy very different water parameters. The water chemistry preferred by these fishes, as might be inferred readily from that of the wild habitat, is soft, acidic water (hardness no higher than 6¬∞ dH and pH around 6.4‚Äì7.0 is preferred). However, for maintenance purposes the pH of the aquarium water can range from 5.6 to 7.4. However, if captive reproduction is to be attempted, the rummy-nose tetra needs soft, acidic water. A planted aquarium is welcomed by these fishes, particularly if the plants include fine- leaved species such as Cabomba and Myriophyllum. Feeding presents relatively few problems, as the fishes will eagerly devour a range of prepared as well as live fish foods. In common with numerous other tetras, these fishes are particularly fond of live bloodworms (these are the aquatic larvae of a midge belonging to the genus Chironomus) and will also devour live Daphnia avidly. Unlike those tetra species which adapt to surface feeding in the aquarium, rummy-nose tetras are not considered likely to add live mosquito larvae to their diet in the aquarium, though instances where these fishes discover and enjoy this food are possible: usually, rummy-nose tetras prefer to take their foods in the middle and lower regions of the aquarium. Lifespan for the rummy- nose tetra in the aquarium is usually 5 to 6 years with careful maintenance. Exceptional specimens can live for more than 8 years. The fish is interesting in that it can act as a \\"mine canary\\" in an aquarium, alerting the aquarist to potential pollution problems in an aquarium. When levels of certain metabolic wastes (ammonia, nitrites and nitrates) exceed critical levels, the intense ruby-red colour of the fish's facial area becomes pale. The fishes also become pale in appearance immediately after the disturbance that takes place in the aquarium following a water change, but in this instance, once clean water has been supplied, the intense deep red colour returns. Persistent paleness of the head is to be taken as a sign that water chemistry parameters in the maintenance aquarium are in need of adjustment, and that pollutant levels are becoming dangerous for the inhabitants. Reproduction Rummy-nose tetras present serious challenges even to experienced aquarists from the standpoint of breeding, primarily due to two factors: the likelihood of sterility ensuing if the prospective parents are maintained in water with too high a level of dissolved calcium ions, and the slow growth rate of the fry. An additional problem is that gender differentiation is difficult by visual inspection alone, making pair selection partly a matter of luck unless an obviously gravid female is available for selection. Again, identical remarks apply to all three species listed above. The breeding aquarium for the rummy-nose tetra, in addition, needs to be sterilised prior to use, as the fish produces eggs that are notoriously sensitive to bacterial and fungal infection. Use of an antifungal agent is strongly advised once spawning is completed in order to prevent various fungi from attacking the eggs. Needless to say, given the above remarks about likely sterility if the fishes are maintained in water whose chemical parameters are incorrect, prospective parents must be maintained in soft, acidic water throughout their lives if they are to remain capable of reproduction. Failure to do so will destroy any chances of success from the very start. Furthermore, it is highly advisable to filter the water of the breeding aquarium over peat, or alternatively use one of the commercially available 'Blackwater Tonic' additives to provide the necessary chemical environment conducive to reproduction. Parent fishes should, in addition, be conditioned heavily with copious live foods to bring them into prime breeding condition. Though the fishes prefer to spawn among fine leaved plants, one problem that the aquarist faces in this regard is that the majority of fine leaved plants available in the aquarium prefer high light levels (Cabomba is a particular case in point) while the rummy-nose tetra prefers to spawn under subdued lighting conditions. Workarounds for this include the use of Java moss (a plant that thrives even in very low light levels, and is an ideal spawning medium for many fishes) or the use of synthetic alternatives (\\"spawning mops\\" made of nylon are typically deployed where a suitable natural plant is unavailable). The parents should be introduced to the breeding aquarium up to 7 days before spawning, fed heavily with live foods, and kept under subdued lighting. In addition, the parents tend to prefer to spawn under quiet conditions, and thus the aquarium should be sited away from areas of busy human traffic. The temperature should be slowly raised to 32 ¬∞C, and sometimes 33 ¬∞C may be needed depending upon the individual specimens. Spawning is difficult to observe, taking place as it does under subdued lighting, and while chase sequences followed by the adoption of a side-by-side position by the parents amid the provided spawning media may be taken as indication that spawning is indeed taking place, this is by no means certain. The judicious use of a low-power flashlight to observe spawning may be helpful in determining if eggs are actually being produced. The species is not noted as a particularly egregious egg eater (unlike, for example, the lemon tetra‚Äîsee that article for notes on egg-eating behaviour in characins) but it is still advisable to remove the parents once spawning is completed. At this stage, antifungal agents to protect the eggs should be added, and indeed are vital in the case of this difficult, sensitive species. Once spawning is completed, it is advisable to keep the aquarium under dim lighting conditions until the eggs have hatched and the fry are free-swimming. While rummy-nose tetras do not need their eggs to be kept in total darkness as is the case for neon and cardinal tetras, the eggs are known to exhibit some degree of photosensitivity, and subdued lighting is highly advisable during egg development in the breeding aquarium. Development Fertile rummy-nose tetra eggs take approximately 72 to 96 hours to hatch at 32 ¬∞C. The fry spend a further 24 to 48 hours absorbing the yolk sac, whereupon they become free- swimming. At this stage, the fry should be fed with infusoria or a special egglayer fry food, and frequent partial water changes (around 10% of the aquarium volume every 24 to 48 hours) initiated. Having overcome the challenge of persuading the fishes to spawn, the aquarist soon discovers that the rummy- nose tetra presents another hurdle to successful captive reproduction‚Äîthe fry are among the slowest growing of all characins, and indeed among the slowest- growing of all popular aquarium fishes. Infusoria and other similar foods are required for the fry for a minimum of three weeks, and it is not unknown for the fishes to take as long as twelve weeks to migrate to larger foods, growth rates being particularly sensitive to temperature. Success at raising fry to a size where they are capable of taking larger food morsels is much more likely to be achieved if the fry are kept at temperatures above 30 ¬∞C for the first 3 months of life: even then, attrition rates due to the appearance of diseases among the fishes (most frequently bacterial infections) can be severe. It can take as long as 6 months to raise fry to juvenile sizes where they are capable of eating live daphnia on a regular basis. During this time, they are likely to be sensitive to sudden changes in water chemistry, and managing pollutants in the fry aquarium is made all the more difficult by the need to maintain low mineral content in the aquarium water during development in order to prevent sterility affecting the fishes‚Äîthe buffering capacity of the aquarium is likely to be low as a result of the low concentration of bicarbonate ions that is needed in addition to the low concentration of calcium ions. Taking all of these factors into account, the fish is a major breeding challenge for the aquarist, and success may depend at least partly upon luck.

Ben Holladay created a stagecoach empire and he is known in history as the \\"Stagecoach King\\". A native of Kentucky, he also was hired as a private courier to General Alexander Doniphan of Missouri. Doniphan refused point-blank to carry out orders to kill the Mormons during the 1838 Mormon War in Missouri. His transportation empire later included steamships and railroads in Oregon. Early life Holladay's lions at the entrance to the Corcoran Gallery of Art Holladay was born October 14, 1819, in Nicholas County, Kentucky. His father, William Holladay (born in what is now Spotsylvania County, Virginia) was a third-generation American, descended from John \\"The Ranger\\" Holladay. William migrated to Bourbon County, Kentucky, where he was a guide for wagon trains through the Cumberland Gap. Benjamin's mother was Margaret \\"Peggy\\" Hughes. Benjamin Holladay learned the freight business at an early age and left home in his late teens for a road trip to Santa Fe in what was then Mexico. He then settled in Weston, Missouri, where he worked as a store clerk before serving as courier during the 1838 Mormon War for the state militia.Allen, Cain. Holladay built W. Oregon railroad. Portland Business Journal, December 31, 2004. After working at the store for a few years he opened a tavern and hotel in 1840, as well as starting what would become the McCormick Distilling Company, which claims to be the oldest distillery still operating in the same location. Business boomed with his supplies for General Stephen Watts Kearney during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Transportation Holladay moved to California in 1852 where he was to operate of stage lines. Holladay acquired the Pony Express in 1862 after it failed to garner a postal contract for its owners, Russell, Majors and Waddell. In 1861 he won a postal contract for mail service to Salt Lake City, Utah, and established the Overland Stage Route along the Overland Trail to avoid confrontations with American Indians on the northern Oregon Trail and Pony Express routes. He added significant infrastructure along the trail, including Rattlesnake Station. Traveling to New York from San Francisco in July, 1862 Holladay was almost killed when the SS Golden Gate sank off Manzanillo.Sinking of the SS Golden Gate, mooneyevents.com; accessed June 11, 2017. Between the Overland Trail and six other routes, Holladay received government subsidies totaling nearly $6 million over a four-year period.Overland Stage Holladay sold his stage routes to Wells Fargo Express in 1866 for $1.5 million. In August 1868, Holladay moved to Oregon, where he had organized the construction of a railroad along the Willamette River, purchasing the illegally incorporated Oregon Central Railroad of Salem, turning it into the Oregon and California Railroad Company. In April 1868, construction started on lines along both the sides of the river. Holladay's \\"Eastsiders\\" completed of track before the competition, using \\"every trick known to man\\" in the construction, including bribing the Oregon Legislature in October 1868. The competition subsequently sold out to him in 1870. Holladay financed the operation via German bankers, who bought $6.4 million of bonds (out of a total $10.95 million). He won a federal subsidy and built the Oregon and California Railroad as far south as Roseburg, as well as controlling the Willamette River commerce through the Portland Dock and Warehouse Company, the Oregon Transfer Company, and the Oregon Steamship Company. The Panic of 1873 financial crisis stopped the effort. Holladay lost most of his fortune in the stock market collapse on September 18, 1873. In 1874, Henry Villard was sent by Holladay's German investors when he was behind on bond interest payments. In 1876, Villard took over the railroad. Personal life Villard described Holladay as \\"illiterate, coarse, boastful, false, and cunning.\\" Holladay's attorney, John Doniphan, described him as possessing \\"many of the characteristics of Napoleon.\\" He was known for having \\"the bearing of one born to command\\", and for \\"being clever, shrewd, cunning, illiterate, coarse, and completely unscrupulous\\". Joseph Gaston described him as being \\"wholly destitute of fixed principles of honesty, morality, or common decency.\\" After buying a large home from Doctor Rodney Glisan, \\"he remodelled it and immediately installed a harem of high class prostitutes.\\" Holladay and his first wife, Notley Ann Calvert (1824‚Äì1873), who he married in 1839, had two daughters who married members of European nobility. Their daughters were: * Jenny Lind Holladay (1851‚Äì1873), who married Arthur de Pourtal√®s, Count de Pourtales. Jenny died young and their only child, a daughter, was raised by her father. * Pauline Cassandra Holladay (1853‚Äì1877), who married Baron de Bussi√®re. After the death of his first wife, he remarried to Lydia Esther Campbell (1849‚Äì1889), a daughter of Hamilton Campbell and Harriet (n√©e Biddle) Campbell. They were the parents of: * Linda Holladay (1879‚Äì1944), who married Ben Holladay Dorcy (1869‚Äì1926), the commanding officer of the 7th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division who was a son of John Chipman Dorcy, in 1899. Holladay died in Portland, Oregon, on July 8, 1887, and is buried at Mount Calvary Cemetery in that city. Legacy An ordinance came into effect on June 1, 1866 renaming McGaa Street in Denver, Colorado to Holladay to honor the tycoon. At the heart of Holladay Street was Denver's red light district. Concerned relatives petitioned the city to strip Holladay's name from the street, which had become widely known as 'the most sinful street in the West.' The city passed an ordinance on June 1, 1889 renaming Holladay Street to Market Street, a tongue in cheek reference to the activities that took place there. This brought much concern to the residents on Market in the more respectable areas to the north. In September 1899, the city changed the name of Market Street north of 23rd to Walnut.

Biography Yardena Finebaum was born on kibbutz Kabri, Israel, to a Jewish family. Her father was an immigrant from Germany who was an Irgun veteran and one of the founders of kibbutz Beit HaArava. Her mother was an immigrant from France, and was a cousin of Marcel Marceau. At the age of two, her family moved to Haifa, Israel, where she grew up. The family also lived briefly in France. She joined the Beit Rothschild group at age 16 and became its lead vocalist. She did her military service in the Nahal entertainment troupe.Yardena Arazi website Arazi is married to engineer Nathan Tomer, with whom she has a daughter, Alona.Yardena Arazi makes a comeback Entertainment career In the 1970s, Yardena Arazi was a member of the female vocal trio Chocolate, Menta, Mastik along with Leah Lupatin and Rutie Holzman. The group represented Israel in the 1976 Eurovision Song Contest with the song Emor Shalom (\\"Say Hello\\"), placing sixth. After the Eurovision competition, they began an international tour that included Brazil, Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium; releasing several singles in English, French and German and appeared in many TV shows all over Europe. Arazi left the band in 1978. In 1979, the Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA) asked Arazi to co-host the Eurovision Song Contest in Jerusalem with news anchor Daniel Pe'er. Her hosting received positive reviews across Europe and she participated in TV shows in the Netherlands with Milk and Honey and in Belgium with Mike Burstyn. Arazi was signed to a recording contract with record label Ariola Records and released a mini-album with songs written by Bernd Meinunger. During this period she met Natan Tomer and decided to return to Israel. During the 1980s Arazi was one of the most successful singers in Israel, being named as the top female singer of the year five times and as the top female singer of the decade; releasing 10 gold and platinum albums. She kept performing internationally including in Poland with Israel Philharmonic Orchestra and Zubin Mehta, in Australia, Turkey, the United States and Egypt. Arazi took part at the domestic Israeli Eurovision competition (Kdam) as a singer in 1982, 1983, and 1985 and as a co-host in 1987. In 1988, she was selected internally by IBA to sing the Israeli entry for Eurovision and during a special TV show, in which she presented four news songs, the entry was chosen. Eventually, she went to Dublin with the song Ben Adam (\\"Human Being\\"), which came in seventh. Arazi has always been highly superstitious and consults an astrologer on all matters in her life. The astrologer told her the song performed 9th would win the competition in Dublin, Ireland. Israel had drawn 9th in the running order, so Arazi agreed to represent Israel. However, when Cyprus withdrew from the contest, Israel's position shifted to 8th. The 9th song did win the competition; with the Swiss triumphing from that position.O'Connor, John Kennedy. 'The Eurovision Song Contest - The Official History'. Carlton Books 2005. In 1989 Arazi recorded the album Desert Fantasy than included 10 Hebrew versions of Arabic songs originally written and sung by Farid al-Atrash, Fairuz, Abdul Halim, Samira Said and others. The album was also released in the US and Japan and was hugely successful around the Middle East. Since 1997 Arazi has focused on her career as a TV host. For 9 years she co-hosted the channel 2 morning magazine Cafe Telad, and later on she hosted at Channel 1 (Shir Hashishim), Channel 2 (Malcot Hashabat), GLZ radio station etc. In 2008 Arazi was named the most popular Israeli singer of all time at the 60th Independence Day celebration.

Composition Coramsine is a chemotherapeutic and immunomodulating agent whose primary ingredients are two solasodine glycoalkaloids, solasonine and solamargine, which are derived from the plant Solanum linnaeanum (Devil's Apple). History The study of glycoalkaloids as potential anti-cancer agents began with Queensland researcher Bill Cham in the late 1970s. Cham heard reports from farmers that topical application of the Devil's Apple plant was effective in slowing the growth of various skin cancers on horses and cattle. Animal studies and in vitro studies showed positive results, however Cham decided to focus his energies on developing the glycoalkaloid mixture, patented as BEC, as a topical cream for non-melanoma skin cancer.Solbec Pharmaceuticals. Retrieved on 15 October 2008. In 2000, Solbec Pharmaceuticals Ltd. licensed the intellectual property rights to BEC from Cham and after it displayed good results against peritoneal mesothelioma in animals. Solbec initiated human trials which also yielded encouraging results. Other researchers have also demonstrated antiproliferative activity of steroidal glycosides against cancer cells. During 2005 and 2006 Solbec was granted orphan drug designation for Coramsine by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma and for malignant melanoma respectively. 2006 also saw the completion of Phase I/IIa trials and the commissioning of Phase IIb trials that would target renal cell carcinoma (stage III/IV) and malignant melanoma (stage III/IV), but in November 2006 shortly before their commencement Solbec postponed the trials due to Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) having concerns about the drug's pre-clinical data. A development plan for coramsine was approved by the TGA in May 2007 resulting in further pre-clinical studies, which were successfully completed in March 2008. Solbec unsuccessfully sought a business partner to develop coramsine further, abandoning its development, as they changed the company's direction as well as its legal business name in December 2008, following the US investment market's late-2008 turmoil and ensuing credit crunch. The subsequent company licensed the technology back to the original founder, Bill Cham, who manufactures it from his private company in Vanuatu and markets it worldwide via the internet under the name Curaderm BEC5, a cream of solasodine rhamnosyl glycosides (BEC). Curaderm BEC5 has not been approved for medical use by any regulatory agency. Mechanism of action Cormasine is thought to kill tumor cells by direct cell lysis, showing selectivity for cancer cells as opposed to healthy cells via a rhamnose binding protein.

Friedl√§nder was born in Kohljanowitz/Uhl√≠≈ôsk√© Janovice, Bohemia. He studied at the Vienna Academy, and later under Professor Waldm√ºller, and visited Italy in 1850, D√ºsseldorf in 1852, and finally Paris. He is associated with the D√ºsseldorf school of painting. He devoted himself at first to historical pictures, creating a genuine sensation with his painting entitled \\"The Death of Tasso\\". After 1854 he painted genre pictures exclusively, taking his subjects chiefly from military life and the local life of Vienna. His scenes from Swabian folk-life are well known. He died in Vienna.

The Eikanger- Bj√∏rsvik band have worked with conductors like David King, Elgar Howarth, Howard Snell, Ingar Bergby, Bjarte Engeset and Nicholas Childs.

It is one of the oldest Chinese cigarette brands currently on the market. History Double Happiness was launched in Hong Kong in 1906 by Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, and has been one of the most influential cigarette brands in China. In its early days it was known as Happydays in English, but its Chinese name, which means literally \\"Red Double Happiness\\", has never changed. After the Communist Party of China won the Chinese Civil War and established the People's Republic of China, Nanyang Brothers was nationalized in two stages: first partly in 1951 and then completely in 1959. The \\"Double Happiness\\" brand is now owned by the state-owned Shanghai Tobacco Corporation. Double Happiness in China In China, the brand, with its yellow and red packaging, evokes tradition, good luck and high status. Because it is culturally iconic and one of the most expensive brands, it is highly popular as a gift during the Lunar New Year and weddings. During the 1980s and 1990s, Double Happiness cigarettes played an unexpected role in Chinese weddings: the bride had to light a cigarette for every man attending the wedding banquet as a token of gratitude. After the 2000s, this custom slowly started to disappear, most likely due to the health hazards that smoking can cause. The brand is also known to be used as a \\"social currency\\" in China. \\"A person who wanted to buy a bicycle in the early 1980s often had to obtain a ration coupon from his unit, and in such a situation it often made sense to hand the individual responsible for issuing coupons a carton of Double Happiness cigarettes and a couple bottles of erguotou baijiu (white liquor)\\" wrote Andrew Wedeman, in his book \\"Double Paradox: Rapid Growth and Rising Corruption in China\\". In 2009, Chinese legislators decided that \\"tobacco consumption had led to an increase in rampant corruption\\" and drafted a bill that would make it illegal for government officials to accept cigarettes as gifts. The bill failed to pass. Controversy In May 2015, it was reported that Double Happiness is specifically targeted towards the growing numbers of Chinese tourists and diaspora and is sold in more and more duty-free shops around the world. The brand is specifically popular because it evokes tradition, good luck and high status. Markets Double Happiness cigarettes are mainly sold in China, but also were or are still sold in Hong Kong, Canada, Australia, Malaysia, Poland and Russia.

Industry and History In the 19th and early 20th century, Summerhill was predominately focused around local farming or coalmining industries, however there was also nearby Brymbo Steelworks and Bersham Ironworks for those who could travel. The nearest colliery was Westminster Colliery, located within the Moss Valley. Most of the area's coalmining industry was closed by the mid 20th century. Remnants of the area's former industrial history include disused features such as railway trackbeds, bridges and tunnels, particularly surrounding the Moss Valley areas. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, a number of housing developments increased the local population and the overall size and shape of the village. Developments in the village include White Lion Estate, built in the 1990s, and more recent developments including Summerhill Park and Westminster Rise, built in the 21st Century. Local services There are few local services in the village, as most needs are provided by nearby Gwersyllt village. Summerhill's post office was closed in 2008 by Royal Mail's restructuring of the rural Post Office network. Summerhill is linked to Wrexham by the historic Summerhill Road, which at the southern boundary of the village, splits into \\"Top Road\\" and \\"Bottom Road\\".

The bloodfin is a relatively large tetra, growing to 5.5 cm. Its notable feature (as the name suggest) is the blood-red colouration of the tail, dorsal, anal and adipose fin, while the body is silver in color. Bloodfin tetras are extremely hardy, making them popular with novice fish keepers. Aquarium care Bloodfin tetras are typically kept in schools of five or more. They swim mainly in the upper and middle water layers and are highly sociable fishes, mixing well with other types of tetras and tropical fish in general, so are often kept (like many other tetras) in a community tank. However, they will tend to nip at the fins of fish with long, wavy fins, such as angelfish or guppies. Bloodfin tetras have also been kept in cold-water tanks, provided the temperature does not drop below room temperature. They have been kept in temperatures ranging from 64‚Äì83 ¬∞F. Tetras are adapted to soft, slightly acidic water, and soft water is essential for breeding. Bloodfin tetras can adapt to many water conditions in captivity, if the tap water is dechlorinated. Breeding At the time of spawning the fish leaps above the water surface and leaves its eggs in the water. The eggs, being heavy, fall to the floor of the tank or water body. The female deposits 300‚Äì500 eggs.

The school was named after Winston Churchill, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945 and 1951 to 1955. Although the language of instruction is English, 59 percent of the students do not use English as their primary language, and 26 percent have resided in Canada less than five years. In Spring 2007, there were 554 male students and 467 female students. Since then, the enrollment sits below 1000 with 644 students. The motto for Winston Churchill is Fides, Virtus, Doctrina which means \\"Faith, Excellence, Knowledge\\". History In the years after World War II, several areas formed new subdivisions and homes developed from farmlands. The Scarborough Collegiate Institute Board needed a high school in the central Scarborough area as two older secondary schools, Scarborough Collegiate Institute to the south and Agincourt Collegiate Institute to the north were filled to capacity. As a result, on December 4, 1953, the datestone for Winston Churchill Collegiate Institute was set in place by the SCIB. The Collegiate Board later formed the Scarborough Board of Education in January 1954. While the school was named after the British Prime Minister during the Second World War, Sir Winston Churchill, the school's name does not have a Sir; it is simply Winston Churchill C.I. The school building was designed by an architectural firm, Carter, Coleman and Rankin Associateshttp://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/node/892 and the building completed during the eight-month span. Churchill opened to its first 690 students on September 7, 1954 as the third high school in Scarborough under the founding principal, A. B. Alison. Initially, the facilities began with 20 classrooms, library, cafeteria, main office, and the gymnatorium. Today, Churchill now has a capacity to hold 1,353 pupils. Crest The crest for Winston Churchill Collegiate depicts an upper arrow shield with a maple leaf, open look and lamp of learning with two winged seahorses as supporters. On top of the crest, the inscription reads \\"Winston Churchill\\" with the letters \\"C\\" and \\"I\\" in between the shield with the motto \\"Fides, Virtus, Doctrina\\" (Faith, Excellence, Knowledge) inscribed on the bottom. Overview The datestone \\"December 4, 1953\\" was erected. Churchill is host to many special events such as the Churchill Cheer, a December event where money is raised for charities, and the Cultural Connections Week. The school has a lot of extra curricular activities and participates with the TDSB night school program (for two years, from 2013 to 2015, it had been split with Birchmount Park Collegiate and SCAS Midland). The school also has hands-on and computer courses such as Auto Shop, Wood Shop, Electronics, Machine Shop, Computer Electronics, Computer Technology, Computer Science, Computer Engineering, etc. Winston Churchill Collegiate, as of 2013, is one of TDSB's flagship Adult ESL Assessment Centres in the east end, replacing nearby Highbrook. Since the closure of Midland Avenue Collegiate Institute in 2000, the school's attendance boundary is now assigned to portions of south of Eglinton Avenue and east of the railway line. Campus The sculpture in front of the school Winston Churchill shares the same design as West Hill Collegiate Institute and has since altered over time. Located in the 15-acre campus in the three-storey, 202,216-square-foot building, it started with 23 classrooms and has undergone major constructions and renovations in 1955, 1961, 1963, 1964, 1966, 1973 and 1983 that currently composes of more than 75+ classrooms for science and academics, four gymnasiums (girls in the upper, boys in the lower - both can be divided into smaller sections), a cafeteria, a library, workshop rooms (wood shop and auto shop) located in the eastern corner, a quad to enable creative learning opportunities for studies in science, the main office/guidance in the northeastern corner, the larger 904-seat auditorium, and the paved race track with the football/soccer field. There are 12 fire exits. The auditorium, located at the southwestern corner of the school, was originally constructed in 1962 to accommodate the partially completed swimming pool but it was converted into an auditorium the last minute after the stage and seats were installed instead, although the plumbing systems remained attached. The building is divided into three floors with the basement in the western corner, the main floor, and the upper floor in the north corner with each wing has block A, B, C, D, and E. Lockers are colored purple, grey, lime green, orange and teal. The main floor is easily accessible because Winston Churchill is one of the TDSB/SBE facilities not to have elevator access. Leonard Braithwaite Program The Leonard Braithwaite Program is an Africentric alternative program offered at Churchill targeting students regardless of race since the 2012-13 academic year. It is the first Africentric program in the TDSB Secondary level and the first high school in Canada to receive one. Oakwood Collegiate Institute was originally to offer the program but it did not materialized due to outcry of protests. The program was named after an Ontario MPP, Leonard Braithwaite. Sports and Clubs Winston Churchill C.I. has a wide variety of sports and clubs. Student Activities Council, Churchill Bull Dog Council (CBC) are among the student clubs. There are also many sports teams at Churchill such as Basketball, Soccer, Flag Football, Ice Hockey, Baseball, Ultimate Frisbee, Rugby, Cricket, Volleyball, Badminton, and many others. After many years a football program has been reintroduced, with Churchill teaming up with Bendale BTI. Colours and Mascot The school colours were originally scarlet and silver, as an ode to the coat of arms of Winston Churchill, they have since been changed to black, white, grey and purple after a deal with the Western Ontario Mustangs team. The Churchill mascot is the Winston Churchill Bull Dog. The school has a big painting of a bull dog in the school's upper gym .

The books tell the adventures of the world's worst private detective, Tim Diamond, and his younger brother, Nick Diamond, who is considerably more intelligent. These books are aimed at young teenagers, slightly younger than those aimed at with the more recent Alex Rider series. However, both series star a teenage boy and include guns, fights and worldwide criminals. The most notable difference is that The Diamond Brothers series contains much more humour, with many puns, pop culture references and absurd situations. Although the books started in the late 1980s and have continued into the millennium, Nick and Tim remain roughly the same age (14 and 28 respectively), while London changes with the times (the newer books feature Oyster Cards and computers for example, whereas the older books feature parts of London that have long since changed, such as smoking in offices). The entire series was re-issued in 2007 with new covers. When released in the North American market, although the stories remained the same, the currency was changed: Therefore, although Nick and Tim live in London, in the American edition they pay for everything in dollars. Books The series consists of the following books: *The Falcon's Malteser (1986): A mystery that starts with Tim being hired to protect a box of Maltesers. *Public Enemy Number Two (1987): A dangerous criminal needs to be caught, so Nick Diamond is once again thrust into danger, and must go undercover as a criminal to catch the crook. *South by South East (1991) Nick and Tim Diamond are once again forced into a mystery, this time going to Amsterdam to discover the identity of the mysterious assassin Charon. The brothers have many hair- raising adventures, including one in which they are chased by a small plane in a scene reminiscent of Hitchcock's classic film North by Northwest. * Three of Diamonds (2004): Three stories previously published separately. ** The Blurred Man: A man who may not have actually been real, but just the made-up story of a made-up organisation, which was never really there. ** The French Confection: The two detective brothers are attacked, arrested, kidnapped, imprisoned, drugged, half-killed and all this on a normal trip to Paris. ** I Know What You Did Last Wednesday: Seven friends along with the Diamond brothers are invited to a remote island for a school reunion. But then the host is found dead, and other people start dying in bizarre ways with no way off the island.

It refers not exactly to the study of what does not exist, but an attempt to cover what may remain outside of ontology. Meontology has a slim tradition in the West (see Parmenides, Plato's Sophist, and apophatic theology), but has always been central to the Eastern philosophies of Taoism and the later Buddhism. Nishida was the first to thoroughly expand the Eastern notion of nothingness in the Continental paradigm and is thus responsible for bringing to the West a clearer understanding of the Buddhist notion of non-being. It can also be associated more recently, with the emphasis placed upon absence or deferral by both Martin Heidegger and Jacques Derrida. French philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy distinguishes nothingness from nothing. He writes, ‚ÄúNothingness is not nothing [rien]....There is no ontology without the dialectic or the paradox of a meontology....Nothing is the thing tending toward its pure and simple being of a thing.‚Äù Nothing is ‚Äúthe vanishing, momentary quality of the smallest amount of beingness (√©tantit√©).‚Äù Jean-Luc Nancy, The Creation of the World or Globalization, (SUNY Press.

Levinas on meontology For Emmanuel Levinas, what was meontological was what had meaning beyond being, beyond ontology; for him this was the ethical, the primary demand of the other in the face-to-face encounter. In this sense he sought to clarify or take further some of the issues raised by Heidegger and explicitly give ontology a secondary role to ethics rather than continue to parallel them in saying that the Being means care (German: Sorge).

The Buenos Aires tetra (Hyphessobrycon anisitsi) is a tropical fish from South America. It was first observed in the wild in 1907, by Carl H. Eigenmann.  History  An aquarium subject for over 60 years, the Buenos Aires tetra is a well loved aquarium fish, often admired for its flashy red color.  Geographic origins  The Buenos Aires tetra originates from its namesake, South America. They are found in South America in the La Plata region of Argentina, Paraguay, and southeastern Brazil. In the wild, they are commonly found in rivers, ponds, lakes, and streams, namely, in the La Plata region. They are a freshwater fish, and do not do well in conditions that may offer too salty or too filthy water. They swim in schools and are a social fish, always together with their own kind. The La Plata estuary. Description The tetra is a tropical, silver metallic-colored fish, with red-tipped fins and a black marking on the dorsal fin. The tetra is a hardy community fish for beginners, and is optimal for the beginning fish hobbyist. It is also relatively large for a tetra, growing up to 7.5 cm (3 inches). They can live up to 5 or 6 years. Its silver color picks up flashy neon highlights depending on how the light hits the fish. The top and bottom of the tail fin is generally red, along with the pelvic and anal fins. The dorsal fin may also have a hint of red at the very tip. Its most distinguishing characteristic is the caudal peduncle, or the connecting area between the tail and the rest of the body, which features a bold, black 'cross' shape.  Behavior  The Buenos Aires tetra are very durable, and do not have any special needs or requirements. A maintained freshwater tank and food is all that they really need. However, they are hearty feeders that must be well-fed or they may begin to nip at their long-finned tank-mates. Keeping the tetras in a school of 5 or more definitely decreases aggression. This species can occasionally nip at and eat aquarium plants.  Nutrition  Buenos Aires tetras are an omnivorous species. In the wild they feed on worms, crustaceans, insects, and plants, but in the aquarium they will generally eat all kinds of live, fresh, and flake foods. To keep a good balance, give them a high quality flake food every day. To keep these tetras at their best and most colorful, offer regular meals of live and frozen foods, such as bloodworms, daphnia, and brine shrimp. Vegetables should also be added to their diet. Feed these tetras several times a day and only what they can consume in 3 minutes or less at each feeding.  Breeding  Buenos Aires tetras breed occasionally in an aquarium setting. They breed by scattering their eggs into their environment, hoping that they will be fertilized and lead to young. When breeding does occur, a hospital or \\"breeding tank\\" will be necessary. For optimal breeding conditions, use slightly acidic water. Much like most other species of fish, once the eggs begin to hatch, removing the parents will reduce the number of lost fry, as the parents will soon begin to eat their young. Once the eggs are laid, the fry will begin to hatch in about 24 hours. For the next three or four days, they will eat their egg sac and then become free swimming fry.

She was the only German submarine to be sunk by land-based artillery fire during the war. Built by Bremen-Vegesack. She was ordered on 25 January 1939, and laid down on 28 March 1940, in the shipyard of Bremer Vulkan in the port city of Bremen-Vegesack as yard number 6. U-78 was launched on 7 December 1940 and formally commissioned into the Kriegsmarine as a \\"school boat\\" on 15 February 1941, with a crew of 41 under the command of Kapit√§nleutnant Alfred Dumrese. Design German Type VIIC submarines were preceded by the shorter Type VIIB submarines. U-78 had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two MAN M 6 V 40/46 four-stroke, six-cylinder supercharged diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Brown, Boveri & Cie GG UB 720/8 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to . The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . U-78 was fitted with two torpedo tubes at the bow, fourteen torpedoes, one SK C/35 naval gun, 220 rounds, and a C/30 anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of between forty-four and sixty. Service history U-78 spent the majority of her career as a training U-boat, during which time she had several different crews. As a result, she never sank any enemy vessels nor engaged any enemy ships or convoys. On 1 March 1945, she was transferred to the 4th U-boat Flotilla but never saw any combat; prior to beginning her first patrol she was sunk on 16 April 1945. U-78's fate is notable in that she was the only German U-boat to be sunk by land-based artillery fire during World War II. Use as a training boat U-78 spent almost her entire career as part of the 22nd U-boat Flotilla as a \\"school boat\\", a role which saw her being used to train U-boat crews. During this time, her commander was changed six times: in July 1941 from Kapit√§nleutnant (Kptlt.) Alfred Dumrese to Oberleutnant zur See (O/L) Kurt Makowski, who remained in command until February 1942 when she was handed over to Kptlt. Max Bernd Dieterich; in July 1942, Kptlt. Ernst Ziehm took command of the U-boat from Dieterich in November 1942. Kptlt. Helmut Sommer took command from Ziehm in May 1943; the sixth commander of U-78 took control of the U-boat when Wilhelm Eisele was named captain and lastly, the seventh commander, O/L Horst H√ºbsch, took command of U-78 from Eisele on 27 November 1944. All of U-78s changes of command took place while the U-boat was still serving as a training boat. Crewmembers used her as a practice submarine before being assigned to their operational U-boat. Sinking By March 1945, the war was coming to an end, the Kriegsmarine was faced with a dwindling number of active U-boats. To offset this, the Navy looked to transfer boats away from other duties, such as training. On 1 March 1945, U-78 began active service with the 4th U-boat Flotilla. Just a month and a half later, however, on 16 April 1945, U-78 was sunk after being attacked by Soviet land-based artillery while she was docked near the electricity supply pier in the German port of Pillau in East Prussia.

The baronetcy passed to her through her predeceased father's line in 1963, making her one of only four baronetesses in British history. Her brother, Edward Courtnay Francis \\"Paddy\\" Moore (1898‚Äì1918), had been killed in action in 1918. Early life Born Maureen Daisy Helen Moore in Ireland, she lived with her mother and C.S. Lewis (who had a 33-year cohabitation with Maureen's mother, Janie King Moore (n√©e Askins)) for 22 years, until 1940, when she married Leonard James Blake (died 1989). She and her mother had started living with Lewis in late 1918 or early 1919, when she was a 13-year-old schoolgirl and Lewis was a 19 or 20-year-old university student. Lewis‚Äôs brother, Warren Lewis, joined the household in 1930. Janie Moore was married, though separated from her husband Courtenay, and remained in that state until her death in 1951, the same year her husband died. Towards the end of her mother's life, Maureen would sometimes trade houses with Lewis, helping him take care of her mother. Dame Maureen had a son, Richard Francis Dunbar of Hempriggs (born Richard Francis Blake on 8 January 1945), so the baronetcy returned on her death in 1997 to the male line. Succession to baronetcy She succeeded to the Scottish baronetcy in the most roundabout of ways possible. Garden Duff-Dunbar of Hempriggs had predeceased his father, leaving two young sons, George, afterwards Sir George Duff-Sutherland-Dunbar, 6th Baronet, and Lt. Cdr. Kenneth Duff-Dunbar, who died in World War I and whose only son, Capt. Kenneth Duff-Dunbar, died in World War II. The widow of Garden Duff-Dunbar, Louise Duff-Dunbar, died just after World War II. Her eldest son, Sir George, succeeded as 6th Baronet on his grandfather‚Äôs death in 1897, but took no part in the administration of the estates, spending most of his life in India as an administrator, where he became well known as one of the country‚Äôs greatest historians. On his death, his only son, George, who had been a barrister in London for some years, succeeded as 7th Baronet. He died comparatively young and unmarried, in 1963. His first cousin and heir Capt. Kenneth Duff-Dunbar had fallen in World War II and in terms of the remainder, his second cousin, Maureen, great granddaughter of Capt. Benjamin Duff, by the only one of his daughters to leave issue, succeeded to the honours and estates and became 8th Baronetess of Hempriggs. Dame Maureen Dunbar was recognized in the name of Dunbar of Hempriggs by Lyon Court in 1965. The male heirs of the first baronet having died out, this Nova Scotia Baronetcy was conferred with remainder to heirs whatever, i.e., it can be and has been inherited through or by a female representative of the family. The arms of Hempriggs reflect the families through whom the title has passed. First, quarterly is Dunbar, 2nd is Sutherland, 3rd is Duff, and 4th is Randolph. When Dame Maureen succeeded to the title, the baronetcy had an estate attached, Ackergill Tower, by Wick, Caithness, Scotland. In the far north east of Scotland, the much-altered tower stands close by the sea shore, about one mile west of the Sinclair stronghold of Girnigoe castle. The earliest part of Ackergill dates back to the 15th century, when an oblong tower house was raised by the Keith family. Dame Maureen lived there and was happy to open the house for inspection to anyone who showed a genuine interest in its history. Today, the Tower is a hotel and conference centre. The house that she, her mother, Lewis and his brother Warren moved to in 1930, The Kilns, a house in Risinghurst, Headington (a suburb of Oxford), was purchased with funds (¬£3,300) provided by the Lewis brothers and Dame Maureen's mother, Janie Moore. Janie's name was solely on the deeds of the property and the title allowed Jack and Warren a so-called 'Right of Life' tenancy, which meant they could continue living there after her death (1951). Free and clear title to the house and estates passed to Dame Maureen when Warren Lewis died in 1973. References *\\"DUNBAR of Hempriggs.\\" Who's Who 1994.
