On Wednesday, February 12, 2014, Chavez was executed at Florida State Prison in North Florida.  Ryce's murder  Juan Carlos Chavez (March 16, 1967 – February 12, 2014) was convicted of, and ultimately confessed to, Ryce's murder. On September 11, 1995, fifteen days before his 10th birthday, nine-year-old Ryce was riding the bus from school. He was dropped off, along with ten classmates, and had to walk less than a block to his home. According to his confession, Chavez blocked Ryce's path with his pickup truck and forced him at gunpoint into the truck. Chavez took Ryce to his trailer where he raped him. About four hours later, when he heard a helicopter hovering above, Ryce ran to the door and tried to open it only to be shot in the back by Chavez, who held the child until he took his last breath. Then, Chavez decapitated and dismembered him. The child's decapitated and dismembered body was found three months later near Chavez's trailer.  Capturing Juan Carlos Chavez  Juan Carlos Chavez was convicted of capital sexual battery, kidnapping, and first degree murder. Chavez worked for the Scheinhaus family. He lived in a trailer on their property. Around the time of Ryce's disappearance, Scheinhaus reported several items missing from her home including a handgun and jewelry. Scheinhaus suspected Chavez, after consulting with a psychic, but had no evidence to support her suspicions. Aided by a locksmith, Scheinhaus entered Chavez's trailer. She found her handgun and young Ryce's bookbag. She reported her findings to the Federal Bureau of Investigation on December 5, 1995. Chavez was found a day later and taken in for questioning. Being advised of his rights and after a 55-hour-long interrogation, Chavez openly admitted to abducting, raping and murdering Ryce. Chavez also led police to the boy's body, which was dismembered and hidden in cement in three plastic planters.  The murder case  In the fall of 1998, Juan Carlos Chavez was convicted of kidnapping, sexual battery, and capital murder. He was sentenced to death. The Florida Supreme Court affirmed his conviction and sentence on November 21, 2002. In July 2004, Chavez filed a motion for post-conviction relief, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion was amended in May 2005, and was heard in Miami-Dade Circuit Court on January 9, 2007. The circuit court judge denied the motion on March 8, 2007. On May 23, 2007, Chavez appealed the denial to the Florida Supreme Court, filing a petition for habeas corpus at the same time. The court affirmed the circuit court's order and denied the petition on June 25, 2009. The United States Supreme Court denied certiorari. On April 17, 2012, Chavez filed a successor motion for post-conviction relief under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850. The circuit court denied the motion on June 13, 2012. On July 20, 2012, Chavez appealed the denial to the Florida Supreme Court, which affirmed the denial on October 11, 2013. On January 2, 2014, Florida Governor Rick Scott signed Chavez' death warrant. Chavez, age 46, was executed by lethal injection on February 12, 2014, at 8:17 p.m. at the Florida State Prison in Starke, just over a month before his 47th birthday.  The Jimmy Ryce Act  The Jimmy Ryce Act (Jimmy Ryce Involuntary Civil Commitment for Sexually Violent Predators' Treatment And Care Act) was passed unanimously by the Florida legislature and was signed by Governor Lawton Chiles on May 19, 1998, becoming effective on January 1, 1999. The act calls for inmates with sex offense histories to be reviewed by the Florida Department of Corrections, the Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF), and state attorneys to determine the level of risk for re-offense. Upon release from incarceration, these inmates may be subject to civil proceedings and commitment to a secure facility for treatment. That treatment center, located in Arcadia, was criticized because treatment is lacking (less than 5 hours per week), it lacks security (several incidents of murder on site, riots requiring hundreds of officers to quell) there is no method of restoring civil liberties (the program has no release stage) being underfunded, understaffed and located in an old condemned correctional facility. After running the center for 7 years, Liberty Healthcare was released by the state as the vendor, and GEO corp was retained. Unfortunately many of the issues regarding step-down programs, community placement or aftercare remain unresolved after nearly ten years. In 2004, residents of the Florida Civil Commitment Center (FCCC) in the custody of the Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) filed a civil rights suit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in U.S. District Court Middle District of Florida, challenging the lack of sex offender and mental health treatment provided at FCCC in Arcadia, Florida. Plaintiffs were all involuntarily civilly confined at FCCC pursuant to the Sexually Violent Predator Act §§ 394.910, et seq. Fla. Stat. (2003). Plaintiffs alleged violations of their constitutional rights and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by the denial of effective sex offender treatment programs, lack of appropriate mental health care and the failure to accommodate inmates with disabilities. Plaintiffs requested certification as a class action and sought declaratory and injunctive relief. Defendants named in the Complaint were the DCF and the private corporation Liberty Behavioral Healthcare Corp. that operated the FCCC pursuant to a contract with the DCF. The court certified the case as a class action. After Liberty was replaced as the private contractor, it was dismissed from the lawsuit which proceeded against DCF. Over the next several years, the plaintiffs and defendants engaged in intensive discovery and pre-trial litigation. DCF and the new contractor, GEO Group, implemented significant changes in the sex offender and psychiatric treatment provided to residents. In the Fall of 2009, plaintiffs and defendants, through their respective attorneys, filed a joint motion to dismiss the suit in favor of a settlement agreement. Federal Court Justice Steele accepted the joint submission and dismissed the class action suit, with prejudice, in November 2009, the same year that Jimmy's mother died.  Jimmy Ryce Center for Victims of Predatory Abduction and Team Hope  The family of Ryce created the Jimmy Ryce Center for Victims of Predatory Abduction to offer assistance to law enforcement, including providing free bloodhounds for use in search and rescue. Ryce's mother, Claudine Dianne Ryce, was also a founder of Team Hope, a group of parents of abducted children who support parents and families facing child abduction.Claudine Dianne Ryce , Biography from the Florida Commission on the Status of Women  See also  * AMBER Alert * Child abduction * Child murder * List of kidnappings * List of people executed in Florida * List of offenders executed in the United States in 2014 * List of solved missing persons cases * Murder of Adam Walsh External links * The Jimmy Ryce Center for Victims of Predatory Abduction website References 1990s missing person cases 1995 murders in the United States Child sexual abuse in the United States Missing person cases in Florida Rapes in the United States September 1995 events in the United States Incidents of violence against boys ","title":"Murder of Jimmy Ryce"},{"id":"6393957","text":"Lafayette Blue Springs State Park is a Florida State Park, located on the west side of the Suwannee River, seven miles northwest of Mayo, off US 27.

Early life Reynolds was born on February 7, 1952 at the US Naval Hospital in Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. His father, Cecil C. Reynolds, was a career marine, enlisting in 1929 and retiring in 1960. His mother, Daphne, owned and taught at a private preschool and kindergarten for 25 years, later becoming a published poet and author of children's books. Reynolds attended New Hanover High School, graduating in 1969, and turned down a Presidential appointment to the United States Naval Academy by Richard Nixon, after being drafted by the New York Mets. He played on various minor league teams within the Mets organization. He made three all-star teams in different leagues prior to a career-ending injury in spring training in 1974, the year of his first major league contract. Higher education Reynolds then returned to his education, earning his B.A. in Psychology in 1975 from University of North Carolina at Wilmington. He then attended University of Georgia (UGA), earning a M.Ed. in Psychometrics in 1976, an Ed.S. in School Psychology in 1977, and a Ph.D. in Educational Psychology in 1978 while studying under Alan S. Kaufman and Ellis Paul Torrance (he was inducted into the UGA Hall of Fame for lifetime achievement in 2006). He completed his internship at the Medical College of Georgia, being mentored there by Lawrence Hartlage as his interests turned more staunchly to neuropsychology. Academic career In summer of 1978 he took his first academic position at the University of Nebraska where he remained for 3 years and where he wrote the grants to obtain the Buros Institute for the University, and became the first Director of the Buros Institute after its founder, Oscar Krisen Buros (Reynolds was Acting Director during the search for a permanent new director in 1979–1980 and worked as Associate Director in 1980-1981) prior to being driven south to Texas A&M; University (TAMU) by the bitter Nebraska winters. In 2006, he was named the Buros Institute Distinguished Reviewer of the Year. Reynolds taught courses primarily in the areas of psychological testing and diagnosis and in neuropsychology in addition to supervising clinical practica in testing and assessment. He remained at TAMU from summer of 1981, where he was a Professor of Educational Psychology, a Professor of Neuroscience, and a Distinguished Research Scholar, until his retirement from the university on July 31, 2008. In September 2008, he was honored by the Texas A&M; University Board of Regents with the title of Emeritus. He currently practices forensic neuroscience in Austin Texas and continues to work in test development. Reynolds holds a diplomate in Clinical Neuropsychology from the American Board of Professional Neuropsychology, of which he is also a past president, a diplomate in Pediatric Neuropsychology from the American Board of Pediatric Neuropsychology, of which he is also a past president, and was a diplomate in School Psychology of the American Board of Professional Psychology, prior to retiring his diplomate in 2004. He is a past president of the National Academy of Neuropsychology, APA Division 5 (Evaluation, Measurement, and Statistics), APA Division 40 (Clinical Neuropsychology), and APA Div. 16 (School Psychology). He is a Fellow of APA Divisions 1, 5, 15, 16, 40, and 53. He maintained a clinical practice for more than 25 years, primarily treating children who had been sexually assaulted as well as individuals with traumatic brain injury. His current consulting work is restricted to his forensic neuroscience practice. Professional honors The American Psychological Association (APA) honored him with Early Career Awards from the Division of Educational Psychology and separately from the Division of Evaluation, Measurement, and Statistics. He received the Lightner Witmer Award from the APA's Division of School Psychology as the outstanding young school psychologist in the association as well. In 1999, he received the APA Division of School Psychology's Senior Scientist Award. He is Past-President of three APA divisions, School Psychology (16), Clinical Neuropsychology (40), and Evaluation, Measurement, and Statistics (5). He is editor-in-chief of the APA journal Psychological Assessment with a 6-year term, beginning January 1, 2009. He was editor-in-chief of Applied Neuropsychology, from 2004–2008, and serves (or has served) on the editorial boards of 16 scientific journals. He served 12 years as editor and editor-elect of the Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology, the official journal of the National Academy of Neuropsychology. Reynolds has served as Associate Editor of the Journal of Special Education, School Psychology Quarterly, and currently is an Associate Editor of the American Psychological Association's open journal, Archives of Scientific Psychology. He is a Past-president of the National Academy of Neuropsychology as well and has received the Academy's Distinguished Clinical Neuropsychologist Award, the Distinguished Service Award, and the President's Gold Medal for service to the Academy. In 1987, the American Library Association declared his Encyclopedia of Special Education to be one of the top 25 reference works published in all fields that year. He received the 50th Anniversary Razor Walker Award from the University of North Carolina at Wilmington for his service to the youth of America. He has been named a Distinguished Alumnus of the Year by both of his alma maters, the University of North Carolina at Wilmington and the University of Georgia, the latter also electing him to their academic Hall of Fame. In 2002 he served as a Distinguished Visiting Professor at Wilford Hall, the USAF showcase hospital and training facility at Lackland AF Base in San Antonio, Texas, where he also conducted grand rounds. Reynolds also conducted grand rounds at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN on the issue of diagnosing learning disorders, and has served as an invited discussant at pediatric grand rounds on several occasions at the annual meeting of the National Academy of Neuropsychology. He has received multiple other national awards for research accomplishments and service as well, including, in 2010, the American Psychological Association's Division of School Psychology Jack I. Bardon Award for a Lifetime of Distinguished Service. In 2011 he was elected a Distinguished Fellow of the National Academies of Practice. In 2017 he received the American Psychological Association's Nadine Murphy Lambert Award, which is given sparingly every 2–4 years to individuals based upon the unusual breadth and depth of their contributions to the field. Scientific writings and impact on psychology His early work, principally in the 1980s, on empirical evaluation of the cultural test bias hypothesis in clinical assessment was not only prolific but at the cutting edge of psychological science at the time and led to resolution of many of the polemic debates over the use of clinical assessment devices with native born American ethnic minorities and moved the remaining arguments from emotion to reasoned scientific dialogue (see for example his 1983, Journal of Special Education paper, “Test bias: In God we trust, all others must have data”). At the same time, he was establishing important research programs in the areas of assessment of anxiety in children and youth and tackling the measurement issues surrounding the field of learning disabilities. The extent of his contributions to psychological science in these areas is easily seen by the fact that, remarkably, two of his papers have been noted as the most cited papers published in the history of their respective journals: his 1978 paper on assessing anxiety published in the Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology, and his 1984 paper describing and resolving many of the critical measurement issues in assessment of learning disabilities appearing in the Journal of Special Education. His subsequent work in the development of interpretive methods for clinical assessment instruments and debunking of the myths of profile analysis of intelligence test performance resulted in abandonment of unsubstantiated but prevalent clinical practices and in substantial changes in how such tests are interpreted today (for example see his 2003 paper with Livingston in Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology and his opening paper of the 2007 special issue of Applied Neuropsychology, which he edited, on this topic), as well as having influenced test development practices. For additional examples see his 1997 paper on assessment of forward and backward memory span, and his two 2000 papers in School Psychology Quarterly on configural frequency analysis and modal profile analysis. His work continues to influence many other researchers, and, since 1985, there have been only 2 issues of the bimonthly Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology in which his work has not been referenced in one or more research articles. He is currently the author of 37 commercially published psychological tests, several of which have profoundly altered the practice of clinical assessment of child and adolescent behavioral and emotional disorders, but also have provided researchers in the field with much needed objective measures of behavior to the improvement of research in childhood psychopathology generally. His Behavior Assessment System for Children for example is the most frequently used measure of child and adolescent behavior in the English-speaking world, and its Spanish redevelopment is widely used throughout Spain and South America in both research and practice. Reynolds' test manuals have notably influenced how such manuals are now written and developed. His 2003 Reynolds Intellectual Assessment Scales Professional Manual, for example, was the first intelligence test manual to incorporate the 1999 conceptualization of validity in the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing, a conceptualization largely derived from the work and careful thought of Sam Messick. His 2002 manual for the Comprehensive Trailmaking Test accomplished the same feat for the area of neuropsychological testing. His 3 measurement textbooks also were the first to explain and promote this modern conceptualization of validity as well. As a journal editor for more than 23 years across 4 major journals (Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology, official journal of the National Academy of Neuropsychology-11 years; Applied Neuropsychology, official journal of the American Board of Professional Neuropsychology-5 years; the APA journal Psychological Assessment-5 years; and now as editor of the APA journal, Archives of Scientific Psychology, the Association's open access journal ), he has exerted a strong, positive influence on research in many areas of clinical assessment and testing. Each of these journals experienced a rise in their impact factor during his tenure as editor, but more importantly he implemented standards for assessment research that emphasized empirical work and replicability and raised reporting requirements for assessment work to new highs. In 1994, he was one of 52 signatories on Mainstream Science on Intelligence,Gottfredson, Linda (December 13, 1994). Mainstream Science on Intelligence. The Wall Street Journal, p. A18. an editorial written by Linda Gottfredson and published in The Wall Street Journal, which presented a scientific consensus regarding (then) current findings on intelligence to assist in clarifying and differentiating mainstream consensus findings on the issue from some of the more scientifically controversial statements in Herrnstein and Murray's volume, The Bell Curve (in which he was miscited as \\"Cyril\\" Reynolds). Today the most commonly used impact index in academia and other scholarly circles is the H-Index. An H-Index of 25, for example, is considered impressive. This value indicates the person has 25 research articles which have each been cited a minimum of 25 times. Reynolds' H-Index is 72, an unusually impressive value. It is useful to compare his value of 72 with that of other important figures in the history of psychological assessment and measurement. Both Lee J. Cronbach and Anne Anastasi have H-Index values of 62. This sort of comparison very usefully places Reynolds' impact into a relevant context and is an informative quantitative summary of his outstanding impact as a psychological scientist who is now one of the most prolific, and most often cited, scientists in the profession.

The major role of the company is to provide growers around the world a resource for marketing their fruit to larger corporations. Founding of Seald Sweet Seald Sweet was founded in 1909 as The Florida Citrus Exchange, a grower-owned cooperative and Florida’s oldest and largest fresh citrus marketing company. The Florida Citrus Exchange helped establish modern packinghouses, uniform standards for packing and grading and marketing programs. During its first year, the Exchange directed the sale of 1.25 million boxes of fruit produced by member-growers. In the years to follow, more packinghouses were established and standardization of grading and packing methods continued to progress. Better grading methods resulted in a finer quality of fruit, which in turn, inspired the development of two nationally-known trademarked brands of Florida citrus—Seald Sweet and Mor- Juice. Changes in the industry Years after its formation, the Florida Citrus Exchange continued to initiate sweeping changes within the industry, such as improved shipping methods and marketing on an international scale, including a promotional campaign. In 1959, in celebration of the grower-owned cooperative's 50th anniversary, the Florida Citrus Exchange officially became Seald Sweet Growers, Inc. In the years to follow, Seald Sweet continued to grow, representing increasing numbers of growers, packinghouses, and hundreds of thousands of cultivated acres of citrus located in all of Florida's growing regions. Seald Sweet continued to build programs shipping millions of citrus each season to chain stores, wholesalers and terminal markets in the U.S, Canada, Europe, Japan, Pacific Rim and Latin America. Seald Sweet's growth In 1998, Seald Sweet joined with UniVeg and De Weide Blik America to form Seald Sweet LLC. Univeg / De Weide Blik is a Belgian holding company, specializing in the processing, trading, production, and distribution of a wide range of produce, convenience foods, plants and flowers.

It states that if a social choice function can be implemented by an arbitrary mechanism (i.e. if that mechanism has an equilibrium outcome that corresponds to the outcome of the social choice function), then the same function can be implemented by an incentive-compatible-direct-mechanism (i.e. in which players truthfully report type) with the same equilibrium outcome (payoffs). In mechanism design, the revelation principle is of utmost importance in finding solutions. The researcher need only look at the set of equilibria characterized by incentive compatibility. That is, if the mechanism designer wants to implement some outcome or property, they can restrict their search to mechanisms in which agents are willing to reveal their private information to the mechanism designer that has that outcome or property. If no such direct and truthful mechanism exists, no mechanism can implement this outcome/property. By narrowing the area needed to be searched, the problem of finding a mechanism becomes much easier. The principle comes in two variants corresponding to the two flavors of incentive-compatibility: *The dominant- strategy revelation-principle says that every social-choice function that can be implemented in dominant-strategies can be implemented by a dominant- strategy-incentive-compatible (DSIC) mechanism (introduced by Allan GibbardGibbard, A. 1973.

Econometrica 41, 587–601.). *The Bayesian-Nash revelation-principle says that every social-choice function that can be implemented in Bayesian-Nash equilibrium (Bayesian game, i.e. game of incomplete information) can be implemented by a Bayesian-Nash incentive-compatibility (BNIC) mechanism. This broader solution concept was introduced by Dasgupta, Hammond and Maskin,Dasgupta, P., Hammond, P. and Maskin, E. 1979. The implementation of social choice rules: some results on incentive compatibility. Review of Economic Studies 46, 185–216. Holmstrom,Holmstrom, B. 1977. On incentives and control in organizations. Ph.D. thesis, Stanford University. and Myerson.Myerson, R. 1979. Incentive-compatibility and the bargaining problem. Econometrica 47, 61–73. Example Consider the following example. There is a certain item that Alice values as v_A and Bob values as v_B. The government needs to decide who will receive that item and in what terms. * A social- choice-function is a function that maps a set of individual preferences to a social outcome. An example function is the utilitarian function, which says \\"give the item to a person that values it the most\\". We denote a social choice function by Soc and its recommended outcome given a set of preferences by Soc(Prefs). * A mechanism is a rule that maps a set of individual actions to a social outcome. A mechanism Mech induces a game which we denote by Game(Mech). * A mechanism Mech is said to implement a social-choice-function Soc if, for every combination of individual preferences, there is a Nash equilibrium in Game(Mech) in which the outcome is Soc(Prefs). Two example mechanisms are: ** \\"Each individual says a number between 1 and 10. The item is given to the individual who says the lowest number; if both say the same number, then the item is given to Alice\\". This mechanism does NOT implement the utilitarian function, since for every individual who wants the item, it is a dominant strategy to say \\"1\\" regardless of his/her true value. This means that in equilibrium the item is always given to Alice, even if Bob values it more. ** First-price sealed-bid auction is a mechanism which implements the utilitarian function. For example, if v_B>v_A, then any action profile in which Bob bids more than Alice and both bids are in the range (v_A,v_B) is a Nash-equilibrium in which the item goes to Bob. Additionally, if the valuations of Alice and Bob are random variables drawn independently from the same distribution, then there is a Bayesian Nash equilibrium in which the item goes to the bidder with the highest value. * A direct-mechanism is a mechanism in which the set of actions available to each player is just the set of possible preferences of the player. * A direct-mechanism Mech is said to be Bayesian-Nash-Incentive- compatible (BNIC) if there is a Bayesian Nash equilibrium of Game(Mech) in which all players reveal their true preferences. Some example direct- mechanisms are: ** \\"Each individual says how much he values the item. The item is given to the individual that said the highest value. In case of a tie, the item is given to Alice\\". This mechanism is NOT BNIC, since a player who wants the item is better-off by saying the highest possible value, regardless of his true value. ** First-price sealed-bid auction is also NOT BNIC, since the winner is always better-off by bidding the lowest value that is slightly above the loser's bid. ** However, if the distribution of the players' valuations is known, then there is a variant which is BNIC and implements the utilitarian function. ** Moreover, it is known that Second price auction is BNIC (it is even IC in a stronger sense - dominant-strategy IC). Additionally, it implements the utilitarian function.  Proof  Suppose we have an arbitrary mechanism Mech that implements Soc. We construct a direct mechanism Mech' that is truthful and implements Soc. Mech' simply simulates the equilibrium strategies of the players in Game(Mech). I.e: * Mech' asks the players to report their valuations. * Based on the reported valuations, Mech' calculates, for each player, his equilibrium strategy in Mech. * Mech' returns the outcome returned by Mech. Reporting the true valuations in Mech' is like playing the equilibrium strategies in Mech. Hence, reporting the true valuations is a Nash equilibrium in Mech', as desired. Moreover, the equilibrium payoffs are the same, as desired. In correlated equilibrium The revelation principle says that for every arbitrary coordinating device a.k.a. correlating there exists another direct device for which the state space equals the action space of each player. Then the coordination is done by directly informing each player of his action.

She was the lead ship of her class of four colliers. She was commissioned on 9 July 1913, to the United States Navy, Master Robert J. Easton, Naval Auxiliary Service, in command. Service history Following her fitting out and shakedown, Proteus steamed out of Norfolk, Virginia on 11 November 1913, on the first of four runs to Veracruz to coal battleships and cruisers of the Atlantic Fleet off Mexico. On 17 December 1914, Proteus left Hampton Roads carrying men, fuel, and stores to the Philippines. She completed the final of four such runs on 4 August of that year. Sailing again from Norfolk on 25 September 1914, Proteus supplied coal, oil, men and stores for ships of the Atlantic Fleet at Rio de Janeiro and Montevideo. Assigned to the Naval Overseas Transport Service, she operated between Norfolk, Boston and New York City for the next several years. Proteus set forth from New York on 14 July 1918, for the British Isles, returning to Hampton Roads on 19 September. She left again on Christmas Eve of 1918 for Brest, France, and spent the next six months shipping coal from Cardiff and Barry, Wales, to Brest. Proteus returned to Norfolk on 6 August 1919, and during the greater part of the next three years cruised from Norfolk to replenish the Fleet in the Caribbean. In the aftermath of World War I, Proteus cruised from Norfolk to replenish the U.S. Fleet in the Caribbean. Crossing the Panama Canal four times, she delivered fuel and stores to Pearl Harbor in 1920, and to Callao, Peru in 1921. Her last supply run to the Caribbean ended at Hampton Roads on 12 April 1923. Proteus spent the remainder of her career in operations between Norfolk and Melville, Rhode Island. She decommissioned at Norfolk on 25 March 1924 and remained inactive until her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 5 December 1940. She was sold to Saguenay Terminals Ltd. of Montreal, Quebec on 8 March 1941 and thereafter operated in the Canadian Merchant Navy under the command of Master Walter Henry Millar. Loss at sea Proteus was lost at sea to an unknown cause sometime after 23 November 1941.

In some cases, these fees are assessed solely for non-members of the bank; in other cases, they apply to all users. Two types of consumer charges exist: the surcharge and the foreign fee. The surcharge fee may be imposed by the ATM owner (the deployer or independent sales organization) and will be charged to the consumer using the machine. The foreign fee or transaction fee is a fee charged by the card issuer (financial institution, stored value provider) to the consumer for conducting a transaction outside of their network of machines in the case of a financial institution. Australia A number of ATM networks are operated in Australia, the largest are: Commonwealth Bank/Bankwest network with 3,400 machines, Westpac/St.George-BankSA-Bank of Melbourne with 2,800 machines, ANZ with 2,300 machines, the rediATM network with 1,800 machines, and NAB with 900 machines, The ATMs of CommBank, Westpac, ANZ, NAB and others are free to use. ING Direct Australia, which does not operate its own ATMs nor have a branch network, reimburses any ATM fees of customers who deposit A$1,000 per month as part of a loyalty program. Australians made more than 250 million ATM withdrawals from banks other than their own in 2016. In September 2017, the \\"Big Four\\" banks announced they would be abolishing non-customer ATM usage fees. The Commonwealth Bank was the first to make the announcement, shortly followed by the three other major banks; ANZ, NAB and Westpac. The rediATM network charges up to A$2.50 for domestic cards and A$5.00 for international cards. Brazil In Brazil, banks such as Caixa Econômica Federal, Banco do Brasil, Banco Bradesco, Banco Itaú and Banco Santander operate their own nationwide ATM networks. These ATMs can be found in many locations such as the bank branch itself, kiosks spread throughout a city or even supermarkets, gas stations, shopping malls and post offices, making it very convenient for the customer to make withdrawals and check balances without incurring any fees. There are also no denial fees (i.e. when trying to withdrawal more money than what's available in an account) as Brazilian businesses cannot charge for services not rendered. However, fees are assessed if there is excessive usage of the ATMs (i.e. one makes more withdrawals than what's allowed by their monthly maintenance fee). Fees and limits can be checked at the Brazilian Banking Federation (Febraban) website. Third-party networks Brazilian banks have several partnerships in place in order to extend their coverage. Correspondente bancário (banking agent) A partnership with an establishment, who then use a small wireless ATM (much like a wireless EFT POS) to process transactions for the bank, such as payments, deposits, and withdrawals. Use of a banking agent normally does not generate any fees. However, fees are assessed if there is excessive usage of the ATMs (i.e. one makes more operations than what's allowed by their monthly maintenance fee). Interbank network There are ATM interbank networks such as Banco24Horas that not generate charges fees for use. However, fees are assessed if there is excessive usage of the ATMs (i.e. one makes more operations than what's allowed by their monthly maintenance fee). Cash withdrawal with a Visa debit card Brazilian acquirer Cielo (formerly known as VisaNet) offers Visa debit card holders an option to withdrawal a small amount of cash (up to R$100, approx. US$30) when paying for merchandise at any Visa-accepting store. Store owners then hand over the money to the customer at the checkout. While the purchase itself generate fees for the business (like any other credit or debit card transaction), the money withdrawal does not, and is reimbursed in full. Canada A short description of the fee structure one experiences while using Canadian ATMs can be found at the Interac website, while the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada maintains a chart of the fees typically charged for use of ATMs in Canada. Interac ATMs Most Canadian financial institutions are members of Interac, a multi-bank ATM network founded by RBC, CIBC, Scotiabank, TD, and Desjardins Group in 1984. Before the presence of white- label ATMs, most Canadian customers were only charged the standard Interac network transaction fee when a customer was using an ATM not provided by the bank that held their account. As the Interac network was opened up to more independent sales organizations (ISOs) and the potential for additional revenue from service fees were made available, most banks elected to impose the service fee in addition to the revenue that was generated from the Interac fee.CBC Marketplace: ATM Fees The Exchange The Exchange is a multi-bank ATM network. It originated in the northwestern United States before expanding to Canada in 1983. As of 2017, many Canadian credit unions, along with The Alterna Bank, Alterna Savings, Canadian Western Bank, Citibank, HSBC Bank Canada, Manulife Bank of Canada, First Nations Bank of Canada and National Bank provide surcharge-free ATM access to members of other participating financial institutions through the network. East Asia Several East Asian countries charge fees for ATM usage. Japan In Japan, usually any ATM offers free withdrawal for its respective account holders. Business weekday from morning to late evening means a free transaction (withdrawal, deposit, balance statements, sometimes bank transfers). Beyond this time limit or even on weekends / public holidays, the ATM charges fees to make a transaction. European Union Austria Cash withdrawals are free for any owner of an Austrian Maestro card at a bank. Some independent ATM's – 67 out of 8,500 as of 2016 – charge a small fee (€1.95 in 2016). By law, a warning is given when a fee is charged. In July 2016 it was discussed if a law should forbid these fees or the fee must be displayed clearly during the transaction. Very few, small banks charge an extra fee when one of their own customers uses a different bank's ATM.http://orf.at/#/stories/2351083/ Bankomatgebühr: Ministerien für Kennzeichnung, orf.at, 25 July 2016, retrieved 25 July 2016 Finland Cash withdrawals are free for any owner of a Finnish bank card or Visa Electron cards on ATM brand \\"Otto.\\" which is the largest ATM network in Finland. There are smaller rivals which have fees. \\"Otto.\\" ATMs accept also Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Diners Club credit cards. They also belong to Maestro, Cirrus and Plus networks. Fees depend on card issuer. Some banks do charge fees after a given number of withdrawals within a month. Germany German banks generally charge fees for withdrawals at another bank's ATM, both within the national Girocard debit card/ATM scheme as well as when using a debit card's Maestro or V-Pay facility abroad. Fees for withdrawals within the Girocard scheme are all implemented as surcharges (direktes Kundenentgelt) which go from €1.95 up to €5.00 or higher and must be displayed to the customer before the money is given out. All ATMs are connected to the national Girocard interbank network. The ATM owners do usually join one of the ATM groups that mutually lower or waive fees, so that customers can withdraw free of charge. The most extensive network of ATMs belongs to the savings banks associations (\\"Sparkassen\\") with 24,600 ATMS. Most of the private banks are either member of the Cash Group (7,000 ATMs owned by the major banks) or Cash Pool (2,500 ATMs owned by smaller banks) – they are usually found in city centers. The credit unions (\\"Volksbanken\\" and \\"Raiffeisenbanken\\") provide around 18,000 ATMs and are associated in the BankCard ServiceNetz, very often in smaller towns and villages, but less frequently available in the big cities. Fees for withdrawing money in the Maestro scheme (outside of Germany, but also at some ATMs at airports in Germany) or with a credit card are charged by the customer's bank and are not displayed during the transaction. Some German banks such as Deutsche Kreditbank, ING-DiBa and Consorsbank have started issuing complementary Visa cards for cash withdrawals to their customers, in addition to the traditional Girocard. Those issuing banks will absorb the interbank fee that they are obliged to pay to the ATM operator under Visa regulations. Although the cards use the Visa credit card protocols, the funds are taken directly from a linked bank account just as with debit cards, and there are no cash advance fees. As surcharges for cash withdrawals by credit card are uncommon in Germany, almost any ATM in Germany can be used for free cash withdrawals with such a Visa card. This is however not the case of the ATMs of IC Cash, that as of July 2016 charge €6.50 without informing their foreign customers. Some banks like the ING-DiBa have started requiring their customers to withdraw at least €50 on their own and partner ATMs. This regulation was put in place because banks pay a fixed amount for a withdrawal from an ATM unattached to the amount the customer withdraws. An exception where the regulation does not kick in is if the customer's balance is below the €50 threshold, then they can get as little money as possible. Ireland Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995 requires a credit institution to notify the Central Bank of Ireland of every proposal to increase a previously notified charge or to impose any charge in relation to the provision of a service to a customer that has not been previously notified to the Central Bank. Not all ATMs are operated by credit institutions. Third party charges are not subject to this notification process. The government imposes a 12 cent stamp duty fee per ATM withdraw in the Republic on debit/ATM cards charged at the end of a calendar year, capped at €2.50 for cards that have only been used at ATMs and €5.00 for cards used at ATMs and point-of-sale. Netherlands Cash withdrawals are usually free for an owner of a Dutch debit card, both within the Netherlands and in the rest of the European Union. Cash withdrawals from another bank in the Netherlands are limited to a maximum of once a day and a lower limit per transaction. The one transaction per day limit generally does not apply to withdrawals outside the country. Up to €2,300 may be withdrawn per cashpoint. Norway No ATM normally surcharges. However, most major card issuers will levy cash-advance fees unless the client pays a higher annual fee for the card. Some cards have no ATM fees, but these are the exception – like Skandiabanken (Sbanken) Visa and Gebyrfri Visa, both smaller foreign-based banks. Poland There are few but extensive independent ATM operators in Poland (e.g. Euronet, ITCARD owner of Planet Cash ATM network, eCard, Global Cash) as well as smaller bank-owned networks. Fees depend on inter-bank agreements and are explicitly stated in card contract. Typically withdrawals from own and allied networks are free while from competitor's machines are subject to a percentage (3-4%) with constant minimum fee, e.g. 5 PLN (~$1.4). In 2013 ATM fee for using other domestic machine was decreased to 1.2/1.3 PLN per transaction. Premium accounts often come without any withdrawal fees, albeit at higher recurring cost. As of 2010 many banks offer optional contracts on \\"free\\" withdrawals from any ATM at flat monthly fee, usually priced similar to one withdrawal. The maximum amount that can be withdrawn in one operation is usually 30 or 40 notes (~US$1,000), varying with the type of machine, ATM management system and banknote denominations used. Portugal All Multibanco withdrawals and payments in Portugal are free. Recent European Union directives allowed merchants and banks to charge the customers for transactions, but the government approved a law that forbids charging any kind of fees. It is alleged that the Left Bloc and Portuguese Communist Party were the political parties that came up with the proposal and the ones more devoted to the idea. Spain There are significant variation in charges applied. A card issued by a Spanish bank will normally expect to incur a moderate fee up to €1 on each ATM withdrawal, where the transaction is conducted on an ATM operated and owned by the customer's own bank. However, outside this situation, there is anecdotal evidence of significantly higher charges being applied where third-party owner/operated ATMs are used, including those operated/owned by other Spanish banks. These may be in reported but unverified cases to be as high as 5% of the value withdrawn. An effort is currently being made to research, identify and quantify the structure and nature of what, from this anecdotal evidence, appear in some cases to be excessive charges. The case is complicated because the fees can originate from the ATM operator, or/and the customers own bank, for as \\"processing fees\\". Sweden In Sweden, most banks issue debit cards for an annual or monthly fee which includes free withdrawals in Sweden and within the eurozone. However, customers are subject to a fee if using a cash machine elsewhere. Some cards from some banks are, however, subject to fees also when used in the eurozone and some Swedish cash machines. Most of these cards are issued by savings banks. United Kingdom During the 1980s the number of banks and building societies charging issuer fees (i.e. charging fees to their own customers when they used another operator's cash machines) gradually increased. However, in 1990 Barclays announced they were introducing an acquirer fee for all non- Barclays cardholders at their cash machines. This would result in \\"double charging\\", where the customer was charged by both their card issuer and the machine operator. Public reaction against this proposal was very strong and a campaign launched by Nationwide Building Society and the UK tabloid newspapers resulted in issuer fees being removed altogether. Interchange fees remained. These are paid by the card issuer to the cash machine operator to cover the cost of the transaction. Their cost is absorbed by the card issuer and not directly passed on to the end customer. In 1999 the UK cash machine network LINK opened membership to so-called independent cash machine operators (IADs); organisations which do not issue cards. IADs initially focused on the pay-to- use market, where the customer covers the cost of the transaction directly and this, coupled with a low-cost business model, meant that the number of pay-to- use cash machines rose rapidly, peaking in 2007 at just over 27,000 cash machines.http://www.link.co.uk/about-link/statistics/ LINK Website - statistics Most of these machines are in low footfall locations such as convenience shops, garages, nightclubs and pubs. The fee charged in 2005 was usually between £1.00 and £1.50, but occasionally they have been known to charge up to £5 and £10. Rules regarding signage on pay-to-use machines were introduced in 2005 and enhanced in 2006 and since 2007 the number of pay-to- use cash machines has fallen. By the end of 2010 there were around 21,000 cash machines. The large numbers of free-to-use cash machines and the low average number of transactions at pay-to-use cash machines means that 97% of cash withdrawals in the UK remain free of charge. As of 2016, there were about 54,000 free to use cash machines, of which 23,600 were provided by independent suppliers, and 16,000 cash machines that charge for withdrawals. Middle East Iran The Shetab Banking System is an electronic banking clearance and automated payments system used in Iran. The system was introduced in 2002 with the intention of creating a uniform backbone for the Iranian banking system to handle ATM, POS and other card-based transactions. There are no charges for money withdrawal in this network. Transferring money between two accounts in a same bank is free but between different banks costs from 5,000 to 9,000 (for amounts of 50,000 to 30,000,000) per day, and checking the account balance costs IRR 1,000 for other banks' cards. Other services are currently free. Southeast Asia Hong Kong There are three ATM networks in Hong Kong: ETC (HSBC and Hang Seng Bank only), JETCO (all remaining banks) and ÆON. ATM use is free of charge, except when a card is used outside of its respective home network. When a card is used outside the home network, HKD$15–30 is paid for service charge. Indonesia In Indonesia, banks generally do not charge a fee for ATM usage. However, when an ATM card is used outside the home ATM network, service charge will apply. Malaysia In Malaysia, ATM usage is free of charge but users may be required to pay a fee when used outside the home network and banks charge a fee of RM 8 to RM 24 annually for a normal savings account. Under Malaysia's Basic Saving Account scheme the fee is waived but the customer is limited to only eighthttp://www.bankinginfo.com.my/02_know_your_products/0201_choosing_right_account/basic_banking_services.php?intPrefLangID=1 Basic Banking service Malaysia free cash withdrawals, after that, banks will charge a fee of RM0.50 to RM1 for every withdrawal until the following month. Also, under the Malaysian Electronic Payment System (MEPS), users can withdraw cash from participating banks for a fee of RM 1 per withdraw. Users can also transfer their fund to another bank via IBFT (Instant Bank Fund Transfer) at a fee of RM 0.30 to RM 0.50 or via IBG (inter-bank giro) at RM 0.10 . Another program called HOUSe by locally incorporated foreign banks in Malaysia also have their own network for cash withdrawals from participating banks. Users of local banks are also considered MEPS users by default and users of locally incorporated foreign banks are considered HOUSe users. MEPS users attempting to withdraw cash from HOUSe networks are subjected to a fee of RM 4 and vice versa. Some banks allow cross-border cash withdrawals, but may charge a fee of up to RM 24 per withdrawal, depending on the kind of ATM network users choose. Philippines In the Philippines, there is a ₱200 charge from local banks when using an international ATM card, in addition to the originating bank's charges. HSBC Bank is the only bank in the Philippines without a ₱200 fee for oversea bank cards. Thailand In Thailand, there is no fee for domestic same-bank same-province transaction. However, customers usually pay an ATM annual fee of ฿200, plus a one-off card fee of ฿100 and convenience fee for withdrawal or balance inquiry at other bank ATM or at a province other than the province where the account is opened. On September 23, 2010, the Bank of Thailand (BOT) announced an ATM fee ceiling framework which came into full effect one year later. Most of the banks will allow customer to have four withdrawal or balance inquiry transactions for free provided that the ATM is located in the same province with the account, then charges up to ฿10 per transaction for interbank same-province ATM usage. Inter-provincial fund transfer or withdrawal fees are capped at ฿20 per transaction as a result of BOT 2010 reform. However, banks are now pushing for high annual fee card by combining personal assurance (PA) into their cards. The annual fee of PA card can be more than three times for the ordinary card (typically ฿200 for a debit card). Many customers are often told that basic cards have run out of stock and they can only choose the PA card. In some cases, customers are not allowed to open an account if he or she is not willing to subscribe to ATM service and pay the card fees. For a foreign card, the ATM service fee is ฿150 (Aeon Bank), ฿180 or ฿200, depending on the bank. Cash withdrawals in the bank office (\\"cash advance\\") typically do not have any fees on top of what the issuer bank may charge. South Asia Pakistan In Pakistan, banks usually charge a fee of PKR 18.75 (equivalent to 10.5 cents USD) for each non- user's ATM cash withdrawal. These fees are levied chiefly to offset banks' own costs at par only, without any profit margin whatsoever. There are two ATM networks operational in the country, 1LINK hosted by a consortium of banks, and MNET. All Pakistani banks are members of 1LINK switch as per the mandate of the State Bank of Pakistan, the country's central bank. Some banks, absorb the costs entirely, and offer their customers totally free withdrawals at all ATMs countrywide, including Azad Kashmir. ATM charges for cash withdrawal from other Bank ATMs (possibly tax exclusive): * Allied Bank Limited: Rs.18.75 (mid-2020). * Bank Alfalah Limited: Rs.18.75 with some account types exempt (domestic), international: Rs. 300 or 3% of withdrawal amount, whichever is higher (mid-2020). * Bank Al-Habib Limited: Rs. 18.75 (domestic), international: Rs. 200 or 2% of withdrawal amount, whichever is higher (mid-2020). * Habib Bank Limited: Rs. 18.75 with Work Account and Freedom Account exempt (mid-2020), was ~16.5 by end-2019. * Habib Metropolitan Bank Limited: Rs. 18.75 (domestic), 3% (international) (mid-2020). * JS Bank Limited: Rs. 18.75 (domestic), international: Rs. 1,000 or 4% of withdrawal amount, whichever is higher (end-2019). * MCB Bank Limited: Rs. 18.75 (domestic), international: 2% (mid-2020). * Meezan Bank: Rs.18.75 (end-2019). * Standard Chartered: Rs. 18.75 (1-Link), Rs. 15 (MNET), 3% (international) (mid-2020). * United Bank Limited: Rs.18.75 (domestic), international: 0 (Pay Pak), 4.5% (Pay Pak/UPI and all other cards) (mid-2020). Sri Lanka In Sri Lanka banks usually charge a fee of LKR 5.00 () for the users of the bank (which provides the ATM) and LKR 15.00 () to LKR 60.00 () per non user's bank withdrawal of cash from the machine. Most ATMs are connected to the national LankaPay interbank network. If the user used their credit card to withdraw money, banks will charge from LKR 300.00 () to LKR 900.00 () per transaction. Bangladesh There are multiple ATM networks in Bangladesh. Dutch-Bangla Bank has the largest ATM network and also the most member banks. Dutch-Bangla Bank customers are charged BDT 200 yearly as ATM network charge if one has any debit card of the bank. Dutch-Bangla Bank has separate agreements with local and international banks whereby Dutch-Bangla Bank charges BDT 10 (US$0.085) per transaction to member banks. Due to this low amount, member banks often add an extra amount as profit margin. India In 2014, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), India's central bank and financial regulator, issued a directive on request from large ATM network and card-issuing banks which expressed concern about the growing cost of ATM network operations, large cash outflows, and other problems. In fact, customers of same bank withdrawing more than 5 times in month were sought to be charged. Present directive reduces Free transaction per month from as five to three with revised charges of INR 20 plus taxes levied per transaction as ATM transaction fee. The number of ATMs, which stood at a little over 27,000 as at end-March 2007, has increased to over 160,000 across the country by end-March 2014. During the same period, POS infrastructure has increased from 330,000 to 1,065,000 terminals. Meanwhile, White Label ATMs (WLAs) have also been introduced in the country with the objective of increasing the ATM density and also building the rural and semi- urban ATM infrastructure. In 2007, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the country's central bank, had issued a directive to all commercial banks to freeze ATM charges and, with effect from 1 April 2009, abolish ATM service charges altogether. Since 2009, customers of any licensed bank are able to use the ATMs of other banks without paying a service charge. Earlier, banks charged between ₹ 10 and ₹ 35 per reciprocal transaction. A person holding card of other banks can withdraw amount from other bank ATM's but the number of transactions is limited to 5; i.e., on the 6th transaction the person is charged up to ₹ 20. However, banks can still surcharge for items such as credit card ATM cash advances and at foreign ATMs. In addition, RBI imposes significant foreign exchange restrictions on the use of Indian debit VISA/MasterCard abroad. For example, Indian debit VISA cards are routinely marked \\"Valid in India and Nepal only\\" due to the country's restrictive foreign exchange reserve policy. Switzerland Fees are not usually charged for withdrawals at a banks' own ATMs, but may be at those of other banks. For example, UBS do not charge for withdrawals at other banks whereas Credit Suisse charge 2 CHF per withdrawal. Sometimes, banks provide the cardholder with 10, 12 or 24 free withdrawals, especially if the bank is a small one, with few ATMs. Most Swiss banks hand out Maestro cards to their customers, in most cases for an annual fee of around 40 CHF, so that any ATM can be used. United States Prior to 1988, there was no surcharging of cardholders by ATM owners in the U.S. In 1988 Valley Bank of Nevada began surcharging \\"foreign cardholders\\" (meaning holders of ATM cards not issued by Valley Bank) for withdrawals at Valley Bank ATMs located in/near Las Vegas casinos.United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Valley Bank v. Plus Sys., Inc.: Eventually, various regional ATM networks, and ultimately the national networks, Plus and Cirrus, permitted ATM surcharging. Before 1996, foreign ATM fees averaged $1.01 USD nationally, according to a 2001 report from the US- based State Public Interest Research Group. As banks and third parties realized the profit potential, they raised the fees. ATM fees now commonly reach $3.00, and can be as high as $6.00,Things to Keep in Mind when Opting for Free ATM Placements Ocean ATM or even higher in cash-intensive places like bars and casinos. In cases where fees are paid both to the bank (for using a \\"foreign\\" ATM) and the ATM owner (the so-called \\"surcharge\\") total withdrawal fees could potentially reach $11. Independent sales organizations (\\"ISO\\"s) are the driving force in ATM deployment in the U.S. today representing over 60% of the 396,000 ATMs nationwide. Some have expressed concerns that the U.S. market is becoming too saturated, spreading the resulting fee pool too thin, which may result in a future net decrease in the number of machines. Other media reports indicate that growth in ATM usage has decreased, possibly in relation to the amount of fees imposed by banks. According to Bank Call Reports, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo earned more than $1.1 billion in 2016 from ATM fees. The average fee for using an out-of-network ATM has reached $4.57 in 2016 and this is the 10th straight year of increases, according to Bankrate. By 2019, the average total out-of-network ATM fees had increased to $4.72. A new charge that has come into the marketplace is the \\"Denial Fee\\", where a customer is charged a fee for attempting to withdraw more money than they are either allowed through their daily withdrawal limit or by having insufficient funds in their account.

The energy is a function of a sum of functions of the separation between an atom and its neighbors. In the original model, by Murray Daw and Mike Baskes, the latter functions represent the electron density. EAM is related to the second moment approximation to tight binding theory, also known as the Finnis-Sinclair model. These models are particularly appropriate for metallic systems. Embedded-atom methods are widely used in molecular dynamics simulations. Model simulation In a simulation, the potential energy of an atom, i, is given by :E_i = F_\\\\alpha\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i eq j} \\\\rho_\\\\beta (r_{ij}) \\\\right) + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_{i eq j} \\\\phi_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}(r_{ij}), where r_{ij} is the distance between atoms i and j, \\\\phi_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} is a pair-wise potential function, \\\\rho_\\\\beta is the contribution to the electron charge density from atom j of type \\\\beta at the location of atom i, and F is an embedding function that represents the energy required to place atom i of type \\\\alpha into the electron cloud. Since the electron cloud density is a summation over many atoms, usually limited by a cutoff radius, the EAM potential is a multibody potential. For a single element system of atoms, three scalar functions must be specified: the embedding function, a pair-wise interaction, and an electron cloud contribution function. For a binary alloy, the EAM potential requires seven functions: three pair-wise interactions (A-A, A-B, B-B), two embedding functions, and two electron cloud contribution functions. Generally these functions are provided in a tabularized format and interpolated by cubic splines.

It looks at how a specific individual, at a specific age, performs intellectually, compared to average intellectual performance for that individual's actual chronological age (i.e. time elapsed since birth). The intellectual performance is based on performance in tests and live assessments by a psychologist. The score achieved by the individual is compared to the median average scores at various ages, and the mental age (x, say) is derived such that the individual's score equates to the average score at age x. However, mental age depends on what kind of intelligence is measured. For instance, a child's intellectual age can be average for their actual age, but the same child's emotional intelligence can be immature for their physical age. Psychologists often remark that girls are more emotionally mature than boys at around the age of puberty. Also, a six-year-old child intellectually gifted in Piaget terms can remain a three-year-old child in terms of emotional maturity.L.K. Silverman, 1997. \\"Asynchronous development\\" is now an accepted aspect of maturation. Peabody Journal of Education, Vol. 72 Issue 3/4 Mental age can be considered a controversial concept.*Thurstone LL. The Mental Age Concept. Psychological Review 33 (1926): 268-278. History Early theories During much of the 19th century, theories of intelligence focused on measuring the size of human skulls. Anthropologists well known for their attempts to correlate cranial size and capacity with intellectual potential were Samuel Morton and Paul Broca. The modern theories of intelligence began to emerge along with experimental psychology. This is when much of psychology was moving from philosophical to more biology and medical science basis. In 1890, James Cattell published what some consider the first \\"mental test\\". Cattell was more focused on heredity rather than environment. This spurs much of the debate about the nature of intelligence. Mental age was first defined by the French psychologist Alfred Binet, who introduced the intelligence test in 1905, with the assistance of Theodore Simon. Binet's experiments on French schoolchildren laid the framework for future experiments into the mind throughout the 20th century. He created an experiment that was designed as a test to be completed quickly and was taken by children of various ages. In general, of course older children performed better on these tests than younger ones. However, the younger children who had exceeded the average of their age group were said to have a higher \\"mental age\\", and those who performed below that average were deemed to have a lower \\"mental age\\". Binet's theories suggested that while mental age was a useful indicator, it was by no means fixed permanently, and individual growth or decline could be attributed to changes in teaching methods and experiences. Henry Herbert Goddard was the first psychologist to bring Binet's test to the United States. He was one of the many psychologists in the 1910s who believed intelligence was a fixed quantity. While Binet believed this was not true, the majority of those in the USA believed it was hereditary. Modern theories The limitations of the Stanford-Binet caused David Wechsler to publish the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) in 1955\\\\. These two tests were split into two different ones for children. The WAIS-IV is the known current publication of the test for adults. The reason for this test was to score the individual and compare it to others of the same age group rather than to score by chronological age and mental age. The fixed average is 100 and the normal range is between 85 and 115. This is a standard currently used and is used in the Stanford-Binet test as well. Mental age and IQ Modern intelligence tests, such as the current Stanford-Binet test, no longer compute the IQ using the above \\"ratio IQ\\" formula. Instead, the results of several different standardized tests are combined to derive a score. This score reflects how far the person's performance deviates from the average performance of others who are the same age, arbitrarily defined as an average score of 100. An individual's \\"deviation IQ\\" is then estimated, using a more complicated formula or table, from their score's percentile at their chronological age. But at least as recently as 2007, older tests using ratio IQs were sometimes still used for a child whose percentile was too high for this to be precise, or whose abilities may exceed a deviation IQ test's ceiling. Controversy Measures such as mental age and IQ have limitations. Binet did not believe these measures represented a single, permanent, and inborn level of intelligence. He stressed that intelligence overall is too broad to be represented by a single number. It is influenced by many factors such as the individual's background, and it changes over time. Throughout much of the 20th century, many psychologists believed intelligence was fixed and hereditary while others believed other factors would affect intelligence. After World War I, the concept of intelligence as fixed, hereditary, and unchangeable became the dominant theory within the experimental psychological community. By the mid-1930s, there was no longer agreement among researchers on whether or not intelligence was hereditary. There are still recurring debates about the influence of environment and heredity upon an individual's intelligence.

Antecedents At the beginning of the 20th century the city of Rio de Janeiro, then capital of Brazil, although praised for its beautiful palaces and mansions, suffered from serious inadequacies in basic infrastructure. Such problems included insufficient water and sewer systems, irregular garbage collection, and overcrowded tenements. Many illnesses proliferated in this environment, including tuberculosis, measles, typhus and leprosy. Epidemics of yellow fever, smallpox and bubonic plague occurred on an intermittent basis. Yellow fever was by far the most serious of the three, killing an estimated 60,000 Rio de Janeiro residents between 1850 and 1908. Although periods of respite from this particular disease did transpire as well, they were almost invariably marred by smaller outbreaks of the others. Beginning in 1902, president Rodrigues Alves launched an initiative to sanitize, modernize, and beautify the city. He gave plenary powers to the city's mayor, Pereira Passos, and to Director General of Public Health Dr. Oswaldo Cruz, to execute sweeping improvements in public sanitation. The mayor initiated an extensive urban reform program, popularly termed the Bota Abaixo (\\"Break it down\\"), in reference to the demolition of older buildings and tenement houses, with subsequent conversion of the land to stately avenues, gardens, and upscale homes and businesses. This resulted in the displacement of thousands of poor and working-class people to peripheral neighborhoods, naturally leading them to become resentful of the city government and suspicious of what it might demand of them in the near future. For his part, Dr. Cruz created the Brigadas Mata Mosquitos (Mosquito-Killing Brigades), groups of sanitary service workers who entered homes in order to exterminate the mosquitoes which had been transmitting yellow fever. The campaign also distributed rat poison in order to halt the proliferation of the bubonic plague, and required proper handling, storage, and collection of garbage. Uprising The Vaccine Revolt in a cartoon of Leonidas, published in the journal O Malho on 10/29/1904. To eradicate smallpox, Dr. Cruz convinced the Congress to approve the Mandatory Vaccination Law on October 31, 1904, authorizing sanitary brigade workers, accompanied by police, to enter homes and apply the vaccine by force. Streetcar overturned during the revolt. Rio de Janeiro's population was confused and discontented by this time. Many residents had lost their tenement housing to the new developments, while others had had their homes invaded by health workers and police. Articles in the press criticized the action of the government and spoke of possible risks of the vaccine. Moreover, it was rumored that the vaccine would have to be applied to the “intimate parts” of the body (or at least that women would have to undress in order to be vaccinated), stirring further outrage among the conservative underclasses and helping to precipitate the rebellion that followed. Many intellectual contingents within Brazilian society opposed the law as well, including the Positivist Church, medical associations, and much of the National Congress. Although most of these objections stemmed from the practice's perceived infringements upon individual rights, vaccination was still considered a valid subject of debate among the global scientific community at the time. On November 5, the opposition created the Liga Contra a Vacina Obrigatória (League Against Mandatory Vaccination). Formed by a coalition of radical republican politicians, ideological factions within the army, and journalists, this group subsequently began to recruit trade unionists at large gatherings held at the Centro de Classes Operairias. The violence finally began when a few young attendees leaving one of these meetings argued with a police officer, and were promptly arrested. Witnesses to this incident furiously besieged the police station to which the men were taken, and continued to fight with cavalry officers brought in to disperse the excited mob. From November 10 through 14, Rio de Janeiro descended into violence as each party to the conflict became entrenched in its position. Rioters looted shops, overturned and burned trams, made barricades, pulled out tracks, broke poles and streetlights, and attacked federal troops with rocks, sticks, debris, knives, and stolen guns. Factory laborers revolted in their own workplaces on the outskirts of town, while impoverished and evicted townspeople attempted to secure control over the heart of the city. The momentum of opposition forces reached its zenith on November 14, when cadets of the Escola Militar da Praia Vermelha (Military College of Praia Vermelha) mutinied against President Alves for his rejection of the terms presented to him in a thinly-disguised ultimatum by General Olimpio da Silveira. Silveira's march on the presidential palace was thwarted, however, when his would-be allies at the academy of Realengo were arrested before they could mobilize. In response, the government suspended mandatory vaccination and declared a state of siege. Its forces successfully drove the rebels from their strongholds beginning on November 15, and concluding on November 18 after a grueling period of close-quarter fighting in the predominantly Afro-Brazilian district of Saude. The rebellion was contained, leaving 30 dead and 110 wounded. Aftermath Despite its relatively swift downfall, the revolt convinced the mayor and his cabinet to abandon the forced-vaccination program for the time being. This concession was ultimately demonstrated to have been quite superficial, however, as the policy was re-instated several years later. Whatever popular frustrations or progressive ideals that the anti-vaccination movement and its allies might have expressed were thoroughly swept aside with the re-imposition of lawful authority, as the processes of unequal economic development and gentrification continued to accelerate following the uprising. Trade unions were severely marginalized, increasingly dismissed by political elites and middle-class professionals as an unsophisticated reaction against modernization. Moreover, the economic power of these native-born Brazilian workers was further diminished as increasingly large quantities of foreign laborers arrived in Rio de Janeiro on an annual basis. Senator Lauro Sodre, a prominent critic of mandatory vaccination and who had collaborated with Silveira to establish himself as Brazil's new president, subsequently enjoyed a figurehead status among Rodrigues Alves's opposition. The punishments dealt to participants in the civil conflict varied significantly across political, social, and economic status. Surviving cadets of the 'Escola Militar da Praia Vermelha' were granted amnesty despite committing what amounted to treason, along with Sodre and prominent members of the Positivist Church. The poor rank-and-file of the revolt were much less fortunate, as many hundreds were deported to both the offshore detention facility of the Ilha das Cobras and the frontier region of Acre. Those transported to this distant latter territory were shipped aboard \\"coastal packet-boats,\\" where it was claimed that they faced egregious conditions comparable to those previously experienced by African slaves en route to the Americas. Unfortunately for Rio de Janeiro, the city suffered additional smallpox outbreaks following the cessation of the mandatory vaccination program. The final straw which prompted the reversal of even this concession in 1909 was a particularly brutal epidemic the previous year, which killed 9,000 residents. The international medical community at large regarded Cruz's efforts in the affair with considerable sympathy; in 1907, the 14th International Congress on Hygiene and Demography in Berlin awarded him their gold medal. The Federal Serum- Therapeutic Institute, at which Cruz had worked, was also renamed the Oswaldo Cruz Institute in his honor.

Although these fossils have been found on Java, the Trinil tiger is probably not a direct ancestor of the Javan tiger. The Trinil tiger probably became extinct 50,000 years ago. The Bali tiger was also not closely related to the Trinil because of their time differences. It was the oldest form of a tiger that lived 1.66 million years ago in Indonesia, particularly in Java and Trinil, although according to some zoologists, it could be the ancestor of all known Indonesian subspecies. Perhaps, East Asia was a center of the origin of Pantherinae. The oldest tiger fossils found in the Early Pleistocene Javanese show that about two million years ago, tigers were already quite common in East Asia. However, the glacial and interglacial climatic variations and other geological events may have caused repeated geographic changes in the area. Taxonomy Much research has been done but there is not much knowledge about this subspecies. Scientists have discovered a fossil that is believed to belong to the Trinil tiger. However, there were doubts that the fossil could belong to the Trinil tiger because it was too big to belong to it. But now it is thought that it might have been a bit smaller than the Bengal tigers and similar to the Indochinese tiger's size. Food competition among large carnivores is a major incentive to increase body weight, so that this Pleistocene subspecies's weight was slightly less than today's Bengal tigers and weighed about 150 kg.

Prof. Hirschfeld was a key architect of the Oslo Accords in 1993. He has been a strong supporter of the two-state solution, and has urged the Palestinian National Authority and the Israeli government to accept some form of this solution. Israeli/PLO negotiations In Benny Morris' account, Hanan Ashrawi and Hirschfeld began maintaining back channels to the PLO's Faisal Husseini in 1989. Hirschfeld, at Ashrawi's suggestion, sought out the PLO finance minister Abu Alaa (Ahmed Qurei). Through the Norwegians—including Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister Jan Egeland and Rod Larsen of the Norwegian Institute of Applied Social Sciences—Hirschfeld had his first meeting with Abu Alaa in London on 4 December 1992. On 19 January 1993 the Israeli Knesset repealed a law forbidding Israeli–PLO contacts. The next day Hirschfeld met Abu Alaa for the second time outside Oslo, accompanied by Israeli historian Ron Pundak. With the approval of Peres' deputy Yossi Beilin the three met in secret four more times. After the final meeting in May the agreement was passed to official channels, to become the \\"Declaration of Principles\\". The first draft of the DOP laid out three basic terms: \\"Israel withdrawal from Gaza, gradual devolution of economic power to the Palestinians ... and ... international economic assistance to the nascent Palestinian entity in Gaza\\". It also included the \\"Gaza first\\" principle, according to which all stipulated Israeli concessions would be met in Gaza prior to any final settlement. By the final meeting it included elections, interim autonomy, and a handoff of power to the Palestinians, over the course of a gradual Israeli withdrawal. \\"Gaza first\\" also came to include some of the West Bank around Jericho. Amid further indirect negotiations between the Israel and the PLO leadership in Tunis through Egyptian channels with mediation by Norway, the discussions that began between Hirschfeld and Alaa culminated in the beginnings of the Oslo peace process, when on August 20 Peres flew to Oslo—the entire process still unknown to the public—and initialed the DOP.

It was an innovator in British motorcycling, part of the Ariel marque. The company was sold to BSA in 1951 but the brand survived until 1967. Influential Ariel designers included Val Page and Edward Turner. The last motorcycle-type vehicle to carry the Ariel name was a short-lived three-wheel tilting moped in 1970. Ariel made bicycles before making motorcycles, and also made cars. Car production began in 1902, moved to Coventry in 1911 and ceased in 1925. The 'Ariel' name was reused in 1999 for the formation of Ariel Ltd, a sports car producer. History Bicycles and early motorised vehicles Ariel—50\\" high wheel bicycle Ariel tricycle circa 1902 The original company was established in 1870 by James Starley and William Hillman. They built wire-spoke wheels under the first British patent; this allowed them also to build a lighter \\"penny farthing\\" bicycle which they named 'Ariel' (the spirit of the air). They put the name on the factory where they made penny-farthing bicycles and sewing machines. In 1885 James Starley's nephew, John Kemp Starley, invented the Rover Safety Bicycle - a bicycle with similarly sized wheels and chain drive to the rear wheel, the design used on bicycles today. Ariel merged with Westwood Manufacturing in 1896 and made a powered tricycle in 1898 with a 2.25 hp de Dion. Hillman left soon afterwards to found Premier Motorcycles. More tricycles were produced and motorised quadricycles were added in 1901 as Ariel moved into car production. (See also List of motorized trikes and/or Quadricycle) Components Ltd. Deferred share of Components Ltd, issued 1. September 1911 1928 brochure for the British motorcycle In 1902, Ariel produced its first motorcycle, which had a Kerry engine with a magneto ignition and a float carburettor. That year, Ariel was taken over by Components Ltd, owned by Charles Sangster. Sangster built a three-speed, two-stroke motorcycle sold as the \\"Arielette\\", but he stopped production on the outbreak of the first world war. In 1918, Sangster's son Jack began managing the Ariel division of Components Ltd and developed a successful motorcycle with a 4 hp White and Poppe engine. Jack increased the range of motorcycles to include 586 cc and 992 cc machines. A range of motorcycles was made until 1926 with engines bought in or assembled to others' designs, until a new designer, Val Page, joined Ariel from JAP. That year Page created a pair of new engines which used many existing motorcycle parts, then redesigned the motorcycle for 1927. These new models are known as Black Ariels (1926–1930) and were the basis on which all Ariel four-stroke singles were based until their demise in 1959 (except the LH Colt of the mid-1950s). During the Black Ariel period, the Ariel horse logo came into being, as did the slogan 'The Modern Motor Cycle'. Ariel Motors 1938 Ariel 350 cc Red Hunter Components Ltd. suffered several financial crises including spells in receivership in 1911 and in the early 1930s. In 1932, Components Ltd went bankrupt, and Jack Sangster, Charles Sangster's son, bought the Ariel subsidiary from the receivers at a bargain price. The company was renamed Ariel Motors (J.S.) Ltd, and promptly resumed production. A new factory was set up at Selly Oak in Birmingham. One of their first bikes was the Ariel Square Four, designed by Edward Turner, followed by the Ariel Red Hunter. The Red Hunter was a success, and enabled Ariel to purchase Triumph. Ariel 1000 Square Four The Ariel Square Four with a 500 cc engine designed by Edward Turner first appeared for the 1931 season. Around this time the company went into receivership and then a new company was formed. The Square Four displacement was increased to 600cc. Throughout their history, the Square Fours had overheating problems with the rear cylinders which resulted in distorted heads. A redesign in 1937 resulted in a 995 cc OHV version designated the 4G. In 1939, Anstey-link plunger rear suspension was an option. It was still available when production restarted in 1946, with telescopic forks replacing the girder forks. During the Second World War, the Ariel factory was turned over to military production, including the Ariel W/NG 350 army motorcycle based on the Red Hunter but with higher ground clearance. In 1949, the Mark 1 Square Four had cast aluminium barrels and heads instead of cast iron. With the lower weight the bike was a 90 mph plus machine. BSA In 1951, Jack Sangster sold Ariel and Triumph (bought in 1936) to the Birmingham Small Arms Company group (BSA) and joined their board. Ariel began making the 500 cc KH model and the 650 cc Huntmaster, which had an engine based on the BSA A10 parallel twin. Reliable and capable of , the Huntmaster proved popular with sidecar enthusiasts. By 1956, Sangster was voted in as the new Chairman, defeating incumbent Sir Bernard Docker 6 to 3. Sangster promptly made Edward Turner head of the automotive division, which then included Ariel, Triumph, and BSA motorcycles, as well as Daimler and Carbodies (the manufacturer of London Taxicabs). In 1953, the Mark 2 Square Four had a redesigned cylinder head, and was capable of 100 mph. The Red Hunter formed the basis for Sammy Miller's 1955 trials motorcycle which proved very successful in competition. Two-strokes and demise 250 cc Ariel Leader Ariel 3, a 49 cc tilting trike In 1959, Ariel dropped its four-stroke engines and produced the Ariel Leader, a fully enclosed 250 cc two-stroke with a fully faired body from the headlamp aft. The Leader aimed to combine the benefits of the motorcycle with the advantages of a scooter. Ariel also made the Arrow, a more open version of the Leader which kept the Leader's enclosed chain case and deep mudguards. Both models were an unsuccessful attempt to compete with new Japanese imports. BSA closed the Ariel factory at Selly Oak in 1962 and moved production of the Leader and the Arrow to the BSA factory at Small Heath. Production of the 50 cc Pixie began in 1963.Bonhams Lot 387 c.1965 Ariel 49cc Pixie Engine no. P886 In 1965, Ariel produced its last motorcycle, the Arrow 200 with capacity reduced to 200 cc introduced earlier during 1964 to qualify for lower UK rider insurance. Ariel motorcycles ceased production in 1967. Later use of the Ariel name In 1970, parent company BSA produced the Ariel 3, a 49 cc automatic tricycle with a coupling between the front and rear frame sections allowing banking when cornering. The front half was hinged to the rear and could tilt into corners while keeping all three wheels on the ground. The design was licensed from George Wallis, of G.L.Wallis & Son, who had patented it in 1966. A small museum dedicated to the trike has been established in Bristol, England. Following the failure of the Ariel 3, the design was licensed to Honda which produced it as the Honda Gyro. In 1999 a new company was formed using the old 'Ariel' name. Initially, the Ariel Motor Company made only one model, the Atom, a high performance, minimalistic 2-seat road-legal sports car, followed by a large-capacity motorcycle named Ariel Ace.

The first proper Ariel car was a twin-cylinder car produced in 1902.Culshaw & Horrobin, The Complete Catalogue of British Cars 1895–1975, p. 44 In 1903 its first four-cylinder was a 15/19 model.\\"15/19\\" meant 15 RAC horsepower, about actually being delivered Both these vehicles had a leather cone clutch that was entirely separate from the flywheel. In early 1904, Ariel began production of a six-cylinder modelCulshaw & Horrobin, The Complete Catalogue of British Cars 1895–1975, p. 45 built on a seemingly inadequate tubular steel chassis. An entirely new range was announced at the end of 1905; called the 'Ariel- Simplex', these cars were Mercedes-inspired four-cylinder designs of 15 hp and 25/30 hp and a six of 35/40 hp. In 1907–1908 the company began production of their 50/60 hp six, which offered a 15.9-litre engine for a chassis price of £950. In 1907 Ariel sold its Birmingham factory to the French Lorraine- Dietrich company, who wanted to enter the British market; Ariel cars were thereafter assembled at the Coventry Ordnance Works, a branch of Cammell Laird. The arrangement with Lorraine-Dietrich was cancelled in 1910. Production of a 1.3-litre light car ended with the outbreak of World War I. Ariel resumed making motor cars in 1922 when it launched the Ariel Nine light car. The Nine had a 997 cc water-cooled side-valve flat twin engine with \\"square\\" dimensions of 85 mm bore and 85 mm stroke made by A Harper Sons & Bean, Ltd of Dudley. The Nine was designed by Jack Sangster, the son of Ariel's owner, who had designed the similar, but air-cooled, twin-cylinder Rover 8 when he worked for Rover. The Nine was capable of 55 mph and about 700 were made. However, the engine was vibratory and noisy, so in 1924 Ariel discontinued the model and replaced it with the 10 hp (RAC) car.By this time, RAC horsepower was a tax formula and was unrelated to the output of the engine. The \\"Ten\\" had a 1097 cc four-cylinder Q-Type engineCulshaw & Horrobin, The Complete Catalogue of British Cars 1895–1975, p. 46 made by the Swift Motor Company. Unlike the Nine it was a long-stroke engine, with a bore of only 60 mm and stroke of 97 mm. The Ten had a gearbox combined with the rear axle. The car was advertised at £180 for the chassis, and about 250 were made. In 1925 Ariel discontinued car production to concentrate on motorcycles.

The first permanent European settlers of the area (Jonas Christie and James Duncan) arrived in 1879, and after the federal Homestead Act passed in 1880, many more settlers arrived in the area, including a number of Icelandic settlers between 1889 and 1894. The arrival of the CPR in 1886 prompted Christie and Duncan to offer land for a town site.

She was among the first women to rise to political prominence in Spain during the early years of reconstituted democracy. She was a minister in the Spanish government from 1996 to 1998 (Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food), and a member of the European Commission from 1999 to 2004. Early life and education De Palacio was born in Madrid, into an aristocratic Basque family, the eldest of four sisters and three brothers, the children of Luis María de Palacio y de Palacio, 4th Marqués de Matonte, and his wife Luisa Mariana del Valle Lersundi y del Valle; the family held also the title of marquis of Guaimaro (a place in Cuba, also an Italian surname). Her mother Luisa died of lung cancer when Loyola was 22, and she took charge of the family. She was educated at the Lycée Français in Madrid, and studied law at Complutense University, and also Communications Engineering, a field in which Luis Maria de Palacio, Sr., was a top expert. Political career In 1976, Palacio was a founder member of the moderate- wing Alianza Popular (later transformed into the Partido Popular) led initially by Manuel Fraga Iribarne, and she became the first leader of its youth section, Nuevas Generaciones. Her politics were on the \\"soft\\", liberal wing of her party. She was elected to represent Segovia in the upper house of the Spanish Parliament (the Senado) in the June 1986 Spanish general election. She joined the national executive of the Partido Popular in 1989, and was elected as a deputy for Segovia in the lower house (the Congreso de los Diputados) in the October 1989 Spanish general election, remaining in the lower house until 1999. She served as minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in José María Aznar's Partido Popular government that accessed to power after the 1996 Spanish general election. Loyola de Palacio in 2004 Palacio headed the Partido Popular's list in the June 1999 European elections, and was duly elected to the European Parliament. She also joined the European Commission on 13 September 1999, as commissioner for energy and transport, in the Prodi Commission. She also served as vice-president (jointly with Neil Kinnock), and took charge of relations with the European Parliament. She pushed forward the Galileo positioning system, and new maritime safety regulations following the Prestige oil spill off the coast of Galicia in November 2002. Life after politics After leaving the commission on 21 November 2004, Palacio became a director at the banks BNP Paribas and Rothschild Bank, and at the pharmaceutical company Zeltia. Personal life Her sister is Ana Palacio. Palacio was a devout Roman Catholic but denied being connected with the Opus Dei group, remarking that even her name (after that of the founder of the Jesuits, Ignatius Loyola) would make that laughable. She enjoyed sports, including mountaineering but she preferred diving and windsurfing. Palacio was diagnosed with Stage IV Cancer in 2006, and was treated in Houston and Madrid for five months. She died in Madrid, at the Social Security: '12 de Octubre' University Hospital, in the frame of a malignancy. Following her death a state memorial was made in which all parties, including the left-wing coalition United Left (Formed by Communist party, Humanist party, and others) and PP critics, united to remember her policies to improve EU regulations. Since 2008, the European Commission has created a European Policy Chair named \\"Loyola de Palacio\\"Loyola de Palacio Chair at the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies in the European University Institute in Italy.

Donaldson, the final book of the first trilogy of The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant series. It is followed by The Wounded Land, which begins the second trilogy. Plot summary Back in his own \\"real\\" world, Thomas Covenant is devastated by the loss of Elena, though he still maintains to himself that his experience in the Land was all just a dream. Tormented by this unanswerable paradox, he neglects his physical condition; he stops taking his medications and fails to treat his head wound, allowing his dormant leprosy to once again become active. Wandering in the woods outside of his home town, he comes upon a lost little girl suffering from a rattlesnake bite. At this point he is once again summoned to the Land, this time by the desperate High Lord Mhoram, who is in need of aid. Covenant finds that seven years have gone by since the Illearth War, and Lord Foul is preparing for his final assault on the people of the Land. Foul has enslaved the tormented spirit of former High Lord Elena, who now wields the Staff of Law in the service of evil. The Lords have lost their most loyal defenders, the ageless Bloodguard, and the Land has been cast into a perpetual winter. Furthermore, Lord Foul has rebuilt his army, which, under the command of the third Giant-Raver Satansfist, now besieges the Lords' mountain-fortress of Revelstone. As a last resort, the Lords have decided to call upon Covenant, in the hope that he will be able to use the wild magic of his white gold ring to repel the siege and save the Land from total destruction. Covenant, however, demands that Mhoram release the summons in order to allow him to save the girl's life in the \\"real\\" world. Mhoram assents. Covenant does manage to save the girl, but at the cost of being poisoned by the rattlesnake venom he has sucked out of her. In this state and with the knowledge that the girl is safe, he accepts another summoning. Covenant finds himself once again at Kevin's Watch, the place to which Lord Foul transported him at the time of his first summoning by Drool Rockworm. This time he has been brought to the Land by the joint efforts of Triock, jilted lover of Lena (whom Covenant raped on his first trip to the Land resulting in the birth of Elena) and the Giant Saltheart Foamfollower, his boon companion from the quest for the Staff of Law and one of the last two surviving Giants. Descending from the mountain and travelling east with Triock and Foamfollower in search of Lord Foul's demesne, Covenant is horrified to witness the depredations caused by Foul and his servants. South of the Plains of Ra, Covenant finds that his old bodyguard Bannor has joined with the Ramen in an attempt to protect the Ranyhyn, the intelligent, free horses who formerly served the Bloodguard as mounts. Covenant convinces the Ramen to take the Ranyhyn south to safety; Bannor, though no longer sustained by the power of his Vow, accompanies him on his journey east. Kidnapped by Ravers, Covenant confronts Elena and uses the power of his white gold ring to dismiss her ghost, although this results in the destruction of the Staff of Law. Bannor declines to follow Covenant further, although he accepts the metal heels of the Staff for safekeeping and eventual return to the Lords. Meanwhile Lord Mhoram, after a protracted battle, is able to break the siege of Revelstone and kill Satansfist. Afterwards, Covenant and Foamfollower journey to Ridjeck Thome, the very heart of Lord Foul's dominion, where they succeed in defeating Foul; this act also repairs much of the havoc caused by Elena's breaking of the Law of Death. Covenant, who has finally gained full comprehension of and control over the power of the wild magic, uses it to destroy the Illearth Stone: in the final cataclysm Foamfollower is killed and so, seemingly, is Covenant. However, his consciousness remains, and while in a state somewhere between being and non-existence, he is spoken to in the darkness by the voice of the old beggar from the beginning of the first book, who is in fact the Creator of the Land. The Creator thanks Covenant for saving his creation and asks him what reward he might accept. Excitedly, Covenant asks the Creator to save Foamfollower, but the Creator regretfully tells Covenant \\"in a tone of ineffable rue\\" that even he cannot undo something that has already occurred: otherwise the Arch of Time, the fundamental structure underlying the Land's universe, will be destroyed. The Creator explains that this restriction, in fact, is what prevented him from dealing with Foul directly: he had to act through a proxy, Covenant, and even after causing Covenant to be transported to the Land, the Creator did not interfere with Covenant's freedom of will in any way. The decision to \\"save or damn\\" the Land was Covenant's own. The Creator then tells Covenant that he has a choice: either he can remain in the Land in full health, or he can be returned to life in his own world, where he otherwise would have died from an allergic reaction to the anti-venom treatment applied to his unconscious body. Covenant, still unwilling to fully accept the Land, chooses the latter and awakes in his hospital bed, weakened from his physical trauma, still afflicted with his disease, but happy to be alive, and secure in the knowledge that he had not failed the Land.

Typically germ-free organisms are used in the study of a microbiome where careful control of outside contaminants is required.  Generation and cultivation  Germ-free organisms are generated by a variety of different means, but a common practice shared by many of them is some form of sterilization step followed by seclusion from the surrounding environment to prevent contamination.  Poultry  Germ-free poultry typically undergo multiple sterilization steps while still at the egg life-stage. This can involve either washing with bleach or an antibiotic solution to surface sterilize the egg. The eggs are then transferred to a sterile incubator where they are grown until hatching. Once hatched, they are provided with sterilized water and a gamma-irradiated feed. This prevents introduction of foreign microbes into their intestinal tracts. The incubators and animals' waste products are continuously monitored for possible contamination. Typically, when being used in experiments, a known microbiome is introduced to the animals at a few days of age. Contamination is still monitored and controlled for after this point, but the presence of microbes is expected.  Mice  Mice undergo a slightly different process due to lacking an egg life-stage. To create a germ-free mouse, an embryo is created through in vitro fertilization and then transplanted into a germ-free mother. If this method is not available, a mouse can be born through cesarean birth, but this comes with a higher risk of contamination. This process uses a non- germ-free mother which is sacrificed and sterilized before the pups' birth. After the cesarean birth, the pups must then be transferred to a sterile incubator with a germ-free mother for feeding and growth.Arvidsson, Carina & Hallén, Anna & Bäckhed, Fredrik. (2012). Generating and Analyzing Germ-Free Mice. 10.1002/9780470942390.mo120064. These methods are only required for the generation of a germ-free mouse line. Once a line is generated, all progeny will be germ-free unless contaminated. These progeny can then be used for experimentation. Typically for experiments, each mouse is housed separately in a sterile isolator to prevent cross-contamination between mice. The mice are provided with sterilized food and water to prevent contamination. The sterilization methods can vary between experiments due to different diets or drugs the mice are exposed to. The isolators and waste products are continuously monitored for possible contamination to ensure complete sterility. As with poultry, a known microbiome can be introduced into the animals but contamination is still monitored for.  Nematodes  Nematodes can also be grown germ-free. Germ-free offspring of the nematode C. elegans, which is used in research, can be produced by rupturing adult worms to release eggs. The standard method for this is to introduce a population of adult worms to a bleach solution. This bleach solution ruptures the adult worms, breaking them down while simultaneously releasing and surface sterilizing any eggs. The sterilized eggs are washed and transferred to a plate of agar containing food for the worms. C. elegans consumes bacteria, so before the eggs can be transferred to the plate, the food must be killed by either heat or irradiation. This method for creating germ-free nematodes has the added benefit of age-synchronizing the worms, so that they are all of similar ages as they grow. Typically the worms will need to be transferred to a new plate as they consume all the food on the current plate, with each plate having been treated with heat or radiation as well. The plates can be protected from outside contamination by covering them and isolating them from possible contamination sources.Stiernagle, T. Maintenance of C. elegans (February 11, 2006), WormBook, ed. The C. elegans Research Community, WormBook, doi/10.1895/wormbook.1.101.1, http://www.wormbook.org.  Plants  Seeds are surface sterilized with chemicals, such as ethanol or an antibiotic solution, to produce a germ-free plant. The seeds are then grown in water or other mediums until germination. After germination, the seeds are transferred to either sterile soil or soil with a specific microbiota for use in experiments. Seeds may also be transferred directly to soil and allowed to germinate. If the plants are transferred to sterile soil, typically there are two types of growth methods. The first is where the entire plant is kept sterile and in the other, only the root system is kept sterile. The method is chosen based on the requirements for the experiment. The plants are grown in isolators which are frequently checked for contamination along with the soil that the plants grow in.Strissel, Jerry Fred, \\"Bacteria-free soybean plants \\" (1970). Retrospective Theses and Dissertations. 4800. https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/rtd/4800  Health effects on organism  Due to lacking a healthy microbiome, many germ-free organisms exhibit major health deficits. The methods used to produce germ-free organisms can also have negative side effects on the organism. Decreased hatching rates were observed in chicken eggs incubated with mercuric chloride, while treatment with peracetic acid did not cause a significant effect on hatching rates. The chickens also exhibited defects in small intestine growth and health. Germ- free mice have been shown to have defects in their immune system and energy uptake due to lacking a healthy microbiome. There is also strong evidence for interactions between the mouse microbiome and its brain development and health. Germ-free plants exhibit severe growth defects due to lacking symbionts that provide necessary nutrients to them.  Uses   Research  Germ-free organisms frequently see use in the studies of different microbiomes. Lacking any microbiome provides insights into what a microbiome contributes to the host. This is done by comparing a \\"normal\\" host to a germ- free host. Any differences between the two and can be understood to be related to the microbiome. This type of study doesn't provide much information on what the microbiome is actually doing, nor does it provide information about specific microbes in the community. To get around this, a known microbiome can be introduced into the host to see the effects of that specific microbiome. By changing the composition of the microbiome, such as switching out a single species, species-specific effects can be found. This also allows for identification of key-stone species within the microbial community.

It was first released as a single in 1994. The song was re-recorded and released as the first single from its third album, ...And Out Come the Wolves. The song reached number 27 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks. The b-side, \\"I Wanna Riot\\" was originally featured on the Epitaph Records compilation Punk-O-Rama Vol. 1 (1994), and a slightly different and longer version of \\"I Wanna Riot\\" with the Stubborn All-Stars was later featured on the Beavis and Butt-head Do America Soundtrack (1996). Track listing #\\"Roots Radicals\\" – 2:47 #\\"I Wanna Riot\\" – 3:06 Song information The song is a tribute to Roots reggae, a subgenre of reggae music known for political radicalism. Specifically, the band is acknowledging that \\"the roots, the reggae on my stereo\\" to which the band listened during their teenage years influenced their later work. The title lyric and the line \\"you know I'm a radical,\\" refer to the Jimmy Cliff song \\"[ Roots Radical]\\", which features the chorus, \\"I'm a radical, I'm a roots radical\\". One of the repeated verses references Desmond Dekker, one of the most successful roots musicians. The song also draws inspiration from Bunny Wailer's \\"Roots, Radics, Rockers and Reggae\\" and Stiff Little Fingers version of that song, \\"Roots, Radicals, Rockers and Reggae\\". The \\"60 bus\\", which is mentioned in the beginning of the song, refers to a transit route that runs north from downtown Campbell, California along Winchester Boulevard to Santa Clara. The \\"43 bus,\\" referenced in the song, is the defunct AC Transit 43 line which ran from El Cerrito Plaza, through Albany, Berkeley and Oakland to the Eastmont section of Oakland. The lines \\"All the punk rockers/And the moonstompers\\" references the Symarip track Skinhead Moonstomp, and alludes obliquely to the band's extensive skinhead fanbase. Another line from \\"Roots Radicals\\" provided the name for Give 'Em the Boot, a series of Hellcat Records compilations albums.

Macculloch envisioned a canal that would transport Pennsylvania coal to New York City. The plan was to construct a canal from Phillipsburg, New Jersey at the confluence of the Delaware and Lehigh Rivers, near the coal fields, to Newark, Jersey City or New York City. The section of the Morris Canal was completed to Newark in 1831, and Port Morris become one of the major stops established along the route of the Canal. With the rise of the railroad came the demise of canals. Despite the changeover in transportation methods, Port Morris found a new role. With the construction of the Lackawanna Cutoff, constructed by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad between 1908 and 1911, Port Morris became a major railroad junction and the starting point of the Cutoff.

It is used to treat insomnia, and to produce sleepiness or drowsiness and to relieve anxiety before or during surgery or other procedures and in combination with analgetics also during labor. Propiomazine is a phenothiazine, but is not used as a neuroleptic because it does not block dopamine receptors well. Mechanism of action Propiomazine is an antagonist at types 1, 2, and 4 dopamine receptors, serotonin (5-HT) receptor types 2A and 2C, muscarinic receptors 1 through 5, alpha(1)-receptors, and histamine H1-receptors. Propiomazine's antipsychotic effect is due to antagonism at dopamine and serotonin type 2 receptors, with greater activity at serotonin 5-HT2 receptors than at dopamine type-2 receptors. This may explain the lack of extrapyramidal effects. Propiomazine does not appear to block dopamine within the tubero-infundibular tract, explaining the lower incidence of hyperprolactinemia than with typical antipsychotic agents or risperidone. Side effects Rare, serious side effects include convulsions (seizures); difficult or unusually fast breathing; fast or irregular heartbeat or pulse; fever (high); high or low blood pressure; loss of bladder control; muscle stiffness (severe); unusual increase in sweating; unusually pale skin; and unusual tiredness or weakness.

Preston Whitmore is best known for his 2007 comedy-drama This Christmas. The film garnered Preston an NAACP Image Award nomination for Outstanding Directing in 2008. Whitmore has a number of television and feature film projects in development at his Los Angeles-based production company, The Preston Picture Company.  Early life  Whitmore was born in 1962 in Detroit, the third and youngest child of Shirley and Preston Alexander Whitmore, Sr. After dropping out of high school, he enlisted in the Marine Corps where he acquired his GED and began taking college courses focusing on law enforcement and criminal procedure. Upon being meritoriously promoted to Corporal and after being honorably discharged from the Marines, he settled in California, went to Los Angeles City College, where he received his associate degree in Arts. He subsequently transferred to California State University, Northridge where he received his Bachelor of Arts Degree in political science. After graduating from CSUN, Whitmore attended the University of La Verne College of Law, where he began developing his skill as a writer, winning the esteemed American Jurisprudence Award.  Film  Whitmore entered the entertainment industry first as a rapper and lyricist for Brian and Eddie Holland of Motown fame. He turned his attention to screenwriting when Motown lyricist and recording artist, Angelo Bond, told him his stories were too big for a three-minute song. Following Bond's advice, Whitmore made two short films, This End of The Couch, starring Lewis Dix, Charles Holman and comic genius Reynaldo Rey and No Reply starring Giancarlo Esposito and Darryl Sivad. Whitmore later established himself as one of the entertainment industry's most prolific writers, having sold a number of high- profile spec scripts and was named by Fade-In Magazine one of Hollywood's Hottest Young Writers. Whitmore made his film-making debut by writing and directing The Walking Dead (1995), chronicling the lives and mission of four African American soldiers in Vietnam. He was inspired to make this film after having served in the Marine Corps. It starred Allen Payne, Eddie Griffin, Joe Morton, Vonte Sweet, and Bernie Mac. Thereafter he wrote and executive produced Fled (1996), an action picture starring Laurence Fishburne and Stephen Baldwin as two prisoners on the lam to find a hidden cache of cash and incriminating computer evidence that would bring down the Cuban Mafia. His work has often focused on the disproportionate incarceration of African American men and women. This is addressed in three films he wrote and produced. The first Lockdown (2000), starring Richard T. Jones, Gabriel Casseus and De'Aundre Bonds as a group of friends unjustly imprisoned, tracking the gritty dissolution of their innocence and friendship behind bars. The film released under Rainforest Columbia Tri-star collaboration, was one of Columbia Tri-Star's top selling independent releases. Civil Brand (2002), which focuses on slave-labor programs in women prisons. This independent shoestring production starring LisaRaye, N'Bushe Wright, Monica Calhoun, Mos Def, Clifton Powell and Da Brat, won the Blockbuster Award for Best film, Best Actor; Clifton Powell, 2002 American Black Film Festival; Audience Award for Best Film, Special Jury Prize, and 2002 Urbanworld Film Festival and featured at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival. In 2004, after completing a production rewrite of the Get Shorty sequel entitled Be Cool, Whitmore wrote, produced and directed the Screen Gems film, Doing Hard Time (2004), starring Boris Kodjoe, Michael K. Williams, Giancarlo Esposito and Sticky Fingaz. Moving away from the gritty subject matter of prison films, Whitmore wrote and directed the basketball drama, Crossover (2006), a film shot in his hometown of Detroit, Michigan about street basketball starring Anthony Mackie, Wesley Jonathan, Wayne Brady, Michael Bivins and Allen Payne. Whitmore wrote, produced, and directed This Christmas (2007), starring Loretta Devine, Idris Elba, Lauren London, Regina King, and Chris Brown. It is a Christmastime drama centered around the Whitfield family's first holiday together in four years. The motion picture was inspired by individuals in Whitmore's actual family, the three Whitfield sons representing Whitmore in different phases of his life. The film won The Asian Excellence Award for Outstanding Actress in a Movie; Sharon Leal, nominated for an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture; Loretta Devine, an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Directing in a Motion Picture; Preston A. Whitmore, II, and an MTV Movie Award for Breakthrough Performance; Chris Brown. Whitmore recently completed production on the feature film True to the Game directed by him, starring Columbus Short, Nelsan Ellis, Jennifer Freeman, Nafessa Williams, Andra Fuller, Draya Michele and Vivica Fox, based on the popular Teri Woods novel of the same name. It was released theatrically the summer of 2017 and debuted on Netflix in 2018.  Television and Theater  Whitmore has also worked in television and theater writing episodes for the half-hour situation comedy, Malcolm & Eddie, starring Malcolm Jamal Warner and Eddie Griffin. Whitmore brought his talent for creating compelling characters to the stage, writing and directing two plays Five A.M. starring Yvonna Kopacz-Wright portraying five characters - each of whom possesses distinctly personal views on the role of women in the world today, most notably \\"Lilith\\". And, Preston Whitmore's PIMP starring Paul Farmer about an unapologetic hustler named Slim Jenkins who is remembered in death in comic and poignant ways by those whose lives he touched. Both plays debuted at the famed Tiffany Theater on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. In addition, Whitmore also wrote and produced the television motion picture crime thriller, Blood Crime (2002), starring James Caan and Jonathan Schaech.  Radio  Beyond his professional accomplishments, Whitmore also lends his talents to his church, Arise Christian Center, producing a weekly syndicated radio program \\"Encouraging You To Go Higher\\" with Pastor Ron Taylor on 102.3 KJLH at 8 p.m. Sunday evening.

The proto-cathedral is located in Downtown San José, one block north of San José State University. It is named after Our Lady of La Vang. The Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul sponsor St. Patrick Elementary School on the church grounds. History The bell of St. Patrick's Church, recast in 1906 from the original 1872 bell Originally called St. Patrick, the parish was established in the city of San José, following what is now the Cathedral Basilica of St. Joseph. The parish was founded in 1872 with Father Joseph Gallagher serving as the first pastor. It was named for Patrick, Archbishop of Armagh and patron saint of Ireland. The original parish church was a Gothic building at the intersection of Ninth and Santa Clara streets, which was completed in 1888. This church was destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, but rebuilt less than a year later. The second church was replaced by the current church at the intersection of Eighth and Santa Clara streets in 1967. From 1981 until 1990, St. Patrick’s served as the cathedral of the Diocese of San José. The cathedra was then transferred to the newly renovated St. Joseph’s, at which time the parish was redesignated St. Patrick Proto- Cathedral Parish. A statue of the Virgin Mary on the church grounds In 2002, the parish changed from being a “regular” territorial parish to being a national parish for the Vietnamese population. In addition to the several services offered in Vietnamese, the parish also offers English and Spanish Masses. The church building was destroyed by a fire on the morning of August 31, 2012, and later demolished. On April 28, 2013, Bishop Patrick J. McGrath signed a decree renaming the proto-cathedral in honor of Our Lady of La Vang. The attached school remained St. Patrick School. A new church building is being constructed on the site of the former proto-cathedral.

Retrieved: October 13, 2010. Plot In the days just after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the American people are asking \\"Where is our navy? Why doesn't it fight?\\" Gravely weakened by the disaster, the US Navy comes up with a plan to trap the Japanese by using one carrier to imitate a fleet in order to deceive the Japanese Navy into heading for Midway, where they will be attacked. Meanwhile, on the carrier charged with the mission (\\"Carrier X\\"), flight commander Bingo Harper is in charge of the bomber crews that shouldered the burden in the desperate early days of the war. He is tough and sticks to the rules, while his young pilots behave more like youngsters and do not always understand his thinking. A new squadron led by Lieutenant Commander Edward Moulton is assigned to the carrier. From the first landing, Harper notices a careless attitude by ex-Hollywood Academy Award–winning star, Ensign Hallam \\"Oscar\\" Scott. Harper warns Moulton that the squadron's safety cannot be jeopardized and any repeat of the sloppiness will not be tolerated. Moulton does his best with his men, but is far from having absolute control. During a bombing run, Ensign Breinard drops a bomb close to the carrier and Harper grounds him. After winning the Navy Cross for actions at Coral Sea, Ensign Cunningham fails to follow the correct takeoff procedure and ditches his aircraft into the sea: Harper forbids him to fly again. Later, Cunningham saves the ship in a suicide attack on a torpedo from a Japanese aircraft. In the meantime, a message is received from Navy headquarters. The carrier is ordered to travel deep into enemy waters, near the Solomon Islands, and make its presence known in order to deceive the Japanese about American fleet dispositions and intentions. However, they are under strict orders not to fight. When Moulton's bombers encounter some Japanese aircraft, they follow orders and retreat, but two aircraft are lost. Not knowing the plan, the pilots are furious. This is repeated several times in other widely-separated locations, driving the aviators to the brink of rebellion. The carrier, however, accomplishes its mission as the Japanese believe that the sightings are of different American carriers, not just one. Finally, the long-prepared trap is sprung. Deceived into believing that the American carriers are scattered across the Pacific, the Japanese are taken by surprise when the concentrated American fleet attacks their carriers. Many pilots are lost, but the Americans win a great victory. However, the last bomber, flown by Scott and very low on fuel, has trouble finding their carrier, which is concealed below low clouds. Moulton begs Harper to turn on the searchlights to guide him in, but Harper refuses to risk betraying the carrier's location to any Japanese submarines that may be lurking nearby. Eventually, Scott's aircraft is heard crashing into the water when it runs out of fuel. Moulton and Harper quarrel, but in a few minutes, it is reported that Scott has been picked up by a destroyer. Harper explains that he cares for all his pilots, but is willing to sacrifice a few for the success of the mission.

The scenario is, however, intentionally changed to justify the initial defensive rather than offensive posture of a US Navy reeling from the early Japanese victories in 1942. The Battle of the Coral Sea is justified as a calculated plot to deceive the Japanese into believing that the U.S. fleet was scattered and vulnerable, while the Battle of Midway is depicted as the eventual springing of this carefully laid trap which thereby caught the enemy at a disadvantage.Orriss 1984, pp. 89–90.

From 1961 to 1971 he was an advertising executive at Leo Burnett Co. He was also a trustee of Northwestern University. He died on November 10, 2013 from complications of a brain tumor. Education Miles attended Woodrow Wilson high school in Washington, DC, and Northwestern University, where he was president of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. He graduated in 1961, with a degree in advertising and journalism from the Medill School of Journalism. Business career Miles began his career at Leo Burnett & Co. in 1961 as a Media analyst, and progressed to the position of VP Account Supervisor. In 1972, he was hired by Kentucky Fried Chicken as VP of Marketing, then held various roles at Heublein before being appointed President of the Kentucky Fried Chicken in 1977. Through a re- evaluation of corporate strategy and a new marketing campaign declaring \\"We Do Chicken Right\\", Miles sparked a turnaround of the struggling KFC, reestablishing the company's relationship with founder Colonel Harlan Sanders and restoring trust with franchisees. He is in large part responsible for the company's large market share today. In 1983, Mr. Miles was hired away from KFC by Dart & Kraft Co., where he became president and Chief Executive in 1985. He helped to orchestrate the $13 billion merger of Philip Morris and Kraft in 1988, at the time one of the largest merger deals in history. He became Chairman and CEO of the two companies in 1991, and was notably the first non- smoking chief executive of a major tobacco company. At Kraft, Miles became well known for his mentorship of up-and-coming managers, and established a development program called the \\"Leadership Corridor,\\" featured in the Harvard Business Review, which fostered current executives of companies including Gillette, CVS, and Sears Roebuck, among multiple others. In 1993, his decision as CEO of Philip Morris to cut the price of Marlboro cigarettes by 20% resulted in the so-called Marlboro Friday stock plunge, as consumers feared the decline of big name brands. Boards of directors Following his executive career, Michael Miles served as a director on the board of numerous Fortune 500 companies, including Dell, Time Warner, Sears, Morgan Stanley, and American Airlines. As a director, he was known for his pragmatic, no-nonsense business approach and his decisive nature.

If a client makes statements that suggest suicidal or homicidal ideation, the clinician has the responsibility to take steps to warn intended victims, and if necessary, initiate involuntary commitment. History The duty to protect was established by Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California, which has been widely adopted by other states. This case determined that the clinician has the duty to warn an identifiable victim. Ewing v. Goldstein extended the duty to protect to include acting upon the statements of third parties that indicate possible threat, and determined that it was not sufficiently discharged by initiating involuntary commitment; warning identifiable victims is also necessary. Criticism The duty to protect has been criticized by some clinical psychologists because it may prevent people seeking help and in fact may cause unnecessary violence because it prevents clients from getting support in resolving their problems. Indeed in the Tarasoff case, the police had been warned about Podar resulting in him being questioned and released and ceasing working with his psychiatrist: the violation of confidential involved in this case could be viewed as the cause of death.

One year, she receives a journal page from a woman whose daughter Olive, a classmate of Martha's, has died in a hit-and-run accident. Martha did not know Olive very well, though Olive admired Martha from afar despite never speaking to or hanging out with Martha. After reading Olive's journal page, Martha regrets how she had not been nice to Olive and discovers they had a lot in common, particularly a love of the ocean and a wish to become a writer. When Martha's family arrives at Godbee's house, an argument between Martha's parents causes tension between everyone in the family. Martha distances herself from her family out of anger and becomes closer to Godbee. They decide to share one secret about themselves every day of Martha's stay. In the meantime, Martha also begins to write a story about Olive as a memorial. During her stay, Martha develops a crush on Jimmy, who is one of the many boys living nearby and is friends with Martha's older brother Vince. When she tells Godbee about her crush, her grandmother tells her to be careful. Martha decides to add Jimmy to her story about Olive, renaming him James. Jimmy is revealed to be interested in film-making and is trying to make a film about \\"life,\\" covering different facets such as family, death, and love. As she spends more time with Jimmy and accompanies him as he records various things for his project, Martha contributes with an interview and tells Olive's story for the \\"death\\" portion. As part of the \\"love\\" section of the film, Jimmy spontaneously sets up his camera on the way back home and kisses her. Martha is shocked when she learns that Jimmy tricked her as part of a bet with Vince and the other Manning boys as to whether he could get her to kiss him on camera before they come back from sailing. She runs off in tears and scraps the portion of her story about Olive and James. Tate, Jimmy's younger brother, apologizes to Martha for his brother's actions. As her stay at Godbee's house draws to an end, Martha fills a jar of ocean water to give to Olive's mother to fulfill Olive's dream, which had been to see the ocean for herself as \\"Olive's Ocean.\\" Martha also decides to abandon her story about Olive. After Martha says goodbye to Godbee, Tate gives her a bag and a note. In the note, he apologizes again for Jimmy's actions and confesses that he likes her. When she gets to the airport, Martha finds Jimmy's tape inside the bag. Back in Wisconsin, Martha goes to Olive's mother to give the ocean water to her, only to find that Olive's mother had moved to Washington or Oregon. Martha writes 'Olive' with ocean water on the front step of Olive's house until the water runs out. Martha stays until the sun dries up the word 'Olive'. And Olive, who had been in her mind a long time, is finally forgotten. Martha then returns home to her loving family.

The route went for along Port Street and Doremus Avenue through the industrial districts of the city. Route 65 began at an intersection with U.S. Route 1 and 9 near Newark Liberty International Airport. The route crossed over the New Jersey Turnpike along Port Street until an intersection with Doremus Avenue, where it turned northward for the rest of the distance, terminating at an intersection with U.S. Route 1 and 9 Truck. Route 65 was originally planned in 1939 as a spur of Route 25, Route 25B, in Newark to connect that route with Route 25T (now U.S. Route 1/9 Truck). The route lasted for 14 years, until January 1, 1953, when the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering occurred. Route 25B was decommissioned on that day, along with its parent route, Route 25. Route 25B was redesigned as Route 65, and was removed from the state highway system by 1963. The two roads are now maintained by the city of Newark.  Route description  alt=A large bridge hovering a 12-lane wide highway viewed from a car Route 65 began at an intersection with U.S. Route 1 and 9 in the area of Newark Liberty International Airport in the city of Newark. The route progressed eastward along Port Street, a divided highway for a short distance. The route crossed the access road to the airport before crossing over the newly constructed New Jersey Turnpike south of Interchange 14. From there, Route 65 continued as Port Street but as one roadway into the industrial districts in Newark. The route progressed further over a railroad before intersecting with Doremus Avenue, where Route 65 turned northward off of Port Street. Both Port Street and Doremus Avenue dead-end right after this respective intersection, Doremus Avenue to the south and Port Street to the east. From there, Route 65 headed northward along Doremus Avenue, crossing over the Newark Bay Extension (Interstate 78) just north of the intersection. The route continued through the industrial district, reaching higher in elevation on a bridge over the Central Railroad of New Jersey (now Conrail Shared Assets Operations, CSAO). From there, the route paralleled the turnpike's mainline along Doremus Avenue. At the intersection with Raymond Boulevard, Route 65 became a divided highway once again, terminating at an intersection with U.S. Route 1/9 Truck in the city of Newark.  History  Route 65 was originally designated in 1939 as State Highway Route 25B, a spur off of State Highway Route 25 (now U.S. Route 1 and 9) at a traffic circle near the Newark Metropolitan Airport (now Newark Liberty International Airport). The route was then to commence along Port Street and Doremus Avenue to an intersection with State Highway Route 25T (now U.S. Route 1 and 9 Truck). Route 25B remained intact along the alignment of Port Street and Doremus Avenue until January 1, 1953. On that day, the New Jersey State Highway Department renumbered routes in the state, and eliminated Route 25 entirely. Due to decommissioning of Route 25, Route 25B was renumbered to Route 65, eliminating the relation to former Route 25 or U.S. Route 1 and 9. Route 65 remained on the Port Street and Doremus Avenue alignment for a short time, and was completely eliminated from the state system by 1963. Port Street and Doremus Avenue are both now maintained by the city of Newark but both are of the National Highway System as of 2009.

The statutes of the Bleimor organization were officially lodged with the Prefecture of Police of Paris in April, 1950. The goals of the association were stated as \\"Practices of Scouting and the activities of cultural expression, dances, choir singing, popular music, dramatic plays\\", without reference to Scouts de France, nor to the Breton language. The first bulletin, published in 1947, specified the objectives of the association as \\"Christian action, Celtic expression, social service, spiritual, cultural and folk formation of the Rovers, Scouts, leaders and Guides of France of Breton origin\\". Bleimor merged into the Federation of European Scouts in 1962. Joseph Chardronnet was chaplain of the organization from 1948 to 1965. Bleimor's flag was a green field charged with a yellow circle and a Scandinavian-style black cross fimbriated with white, the whole representing a Celtic cross. Rectangular as well as triangular flags were used. The Scout movement also used a white flag with a black cross voided through and seven black ermine spots in the canton.

He served directly under General Robert E. Lee as the medical director for the Army of Northern Virginia for all its major campaigns, including the Gettysburg Campaign and the Overland Campaign. Biography Early life and career LaFayette Guild was the third of eight children and second of four sons of Mary Elizabeth Williams (1802–1885) and Dr James L Guild (1799–1884). His mother was a daughter of Agnes Payne (1775–1850) and Judge Marmaduke Williams (1772–1850). His grandmother Agnes was a first cousin of Dolley Madison. Judge Williams was an early settler of Alabama and was the losing candidate in the first Alabama gubernatorial race in 1819; he was also a longtime trustee of the University of Alabama. LaFayette's father was the brother of Judge Josephus Conn Guild (1802–1883) of Tennessee. (See Rose Mont.) A native of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Guild briefly moved to Texas but returned to Alabama for college. He graduated from the University of Alabama in 1845 and then from Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia in 1848. He was appointed as assistant surgeon in the U.S. Army on March 2, 1849. He served in various assignments, then became the medical director of the army post on Governor's Island in New York Harbor. Guild studied the impact of the quarantine station, and found that isolating ill soldiers and United States Navy sailors did not prevent the spread of certain diseases such as yellow fever. In his opinion, the disease was not merely contagious, but infectious and portable. His observations were used to combat and limit an outbreak of yellow fever in 1856. The following year, he moved to the West Coast to direct the military hospital in the Presidio of San Francisco, where he was stationed when the Civil War erupted. According to several sources, including the 1860 U.S. census, Guild was also stationed at Fort Humboldt as that post's surgeon. Civil War In July 1861, still with the rank of assistant surgeon, Guild was dismissed from the Federal army after refusing to take the oath of allegiance. He subsequently traveled to the South and accepted a surgeon's commission in the Confederate forces in Richmond, Virginia. He became chief surgeon and medical director of the Army of Northern Virginia during the Peninsula Campaign in 1862 after Robert E. Lee replaced Gen.Joseph E. Johnston in command and established his own leadership staff. He remained in that role until the army's surrender at Appomattox Court House. Following the Battle of Chancellorsville, Guild worked directly with Dr. Jonathan Letterman, his counterpart in the Union Army of the Potomac, to arrange a truce and a procedure so that each army could collect its wounded from the contested battlefield. During Lee's retreat following the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, Guild oversaw the evacuation of the Confederate wounded and their subsequent protection by cavalry under Brig. Gen. John D. Imboden. Guild was often frustrated by the inability of the Confederate government to maintain a consistent source of medical supplies to the army in the field. However, his pre-war observations of the spread of infectious or communicable diseases helped him establish a series of protocols within the doctors of the Army of Northern Virginia to help combat the spread of venereal diseases such as syphilis, as well as other potentially deadly illnesses. Guild served for much of the war as Lee's personal physician and medical consultant, and from the Siege of Petersburg until the end of the war, he was often accompanied by his wife Martha Aylette Fitts \\"Pattie\\" Guild (1831–1902), who moved to Virginia to be near her husband. Postbellum Following the war, Guild moved to Mobile, Alabama, and fought yellow fever as the medical inspector for the Port of Mobile. He published many of his observations, which formed the basis for future research in combating the deadly disease. Guild died in San Francisco, California, and was interred in Evergreen Cemetery in his native Tuscaloosa, Alabama. His wife Pattie died in 1902 and is buried beside him. The Lafaytte Guild chapter of the Gorgas Medical Society at the University of Alabama is named in his honor.

Istalif was always renowned as one of the most beautiful places in Afghanistan - the Emperor Babur fell in love with it in the 16th century and used to hold parties in his rose garden and summer house there. Alexander Burnes, a British political agent to Dost Mohammed in the 19th century, had come here to relax amid the plane and walnut trees. He described that the mountains streams are full of fishes and the orchards and vineyards are richest. During the final phase of the First Anglo-Afghan War, as General Pollock's Army of Retribution marched into Kabul, many families fled to Istalif. Troops were dispatched, which surrounded the town, attacked, and then systemically pillaged it. The British and Indian soldiers set fire to the cotton cloth of their victims and burnt them alive.

It is commonly played with 15mm or 28mm scale miniatures representing troops of various fantasy races and creatures. There are 16 core armies that can be played, including elves, dwarves, orcs, and multiple human races, but other armies have been made \\"official\\" on the Thane's Games website. Numerous monsters are also available for any army to use in their battles. The background for the game is largely open for individual players to customise themselves and not feel restricted by one \\"official\\" account of relations between races. This removes the common problem in miniature wargames of some pairs of players armies having no \\"excuse\\" to fight each other. However, a coordinated background development project is under way at the Armies of Arcana forum. Although it provides 16 basic armies, Armies of Arcana was created to allow players to use any miniature they want, so a point system was created to enable players to create their own troops that could still be equally matched against existing soldiers. The Armies Demons The Dark Elves brought Demons to Arcana in search for allies, but their alliance soon crumbled. The demons are now stuck on Arcana with no means of getting back to their chaotic homeworld, but the demon lords seem more than happy to conquer the \\"lesser\\" races of Arcana. Dwarves The Dwarves are one of the oldest races of Arcana. They live underground and have managed to avoid much of the conflict on the surface, though they lost most of their magic during the Elven Mage Wars. Dark Elves Dark Elves believe that they are the superior race of Arcana, and thus enslave humans and orcs alike, as well as hunt lizard-men, beast-men, and goblins for sport. Captives of the lesser races are sacrificed, and many nobles engage in ritual combat with slaves. High Elves As the superior race of Arcana, High Elves believe it is their duty to teach and enlighten the lesser races. Thus High Elves support friendly relationships with peaceful allies, and often engage in trading with them. High elves are sea-farers, and all of their cities are coastal. Sylvan Elves Sylvan Elves believe that they are the defenders of Arcana. Unlike their brethren, they have abandoned the cities and now live in a natural affinity with the forests. Sylvan Elves take pride in the many kinds of plants they grow, and will willingly trade this with other friendly races. Though Sylvan elves do not seek war, they will defend their homelands when in danger. Humans Much of the race was enslaved by the elves while they were still living in barbaric tribes. Many slaves escaped back to their wild cousins with knowledge of elven civilization - for this reason, much of human civilization works like elven civilization. The humans have since been mostly freed of elven bondage, and many small empires have developed across Arcana. Barbarian tribes still exist in the wilder areas of Arcana as well. Other armies included and described in the 5th edition book are Orcs, The Giant Kings, Halflings and Centaurs, Goblins, Undead, Beastmen, Lizardmen, and Hogs.

History Guillaume de Machault De tout flors (intabulation in the Faenza Codex) Intabulation was a common practice in 14th–16th century keyboard and lute music. A direct effect of intabulation was one of the early advantages of keyboards, the ability to render multiple instruments' music on one instrument. The earliest intabulation is from the mid-14th century Robertsbridge Codex, also one of the first sources of keyboard music still in existence. Some other early sources of intabulated music are the Faenza Codex and the Reina manuscripts (from the 14th century) and the Buxheim manuscript (from the 15th century). The Faenza manuscript, the largest of these early manuscripts, written circa 1400, contains pieces written or transcribed in the 14th century, such as those by Francesco Landini and Guillaume de Machaut. More than half of its pieces are intabulations. The large Buxheim manuscript is dominated by intabulations, mainly of prominent composers of the time, including John Dunstaple, Gilles Binchois, Walter Frye, and Guillaume Dufay. The term \\"intabulation\\" continued to be popular through the 16th century, but fell out of use in the early 17th century, though the practice continued. The exception is the 16th- and 17th-century Italian keyboard pieces which included both vocal and instrumental music. Intabulations contain all the vocal lines of a polyphonic piece, for the most part, although they are sometimes combined or redistributed in order to work better on the instrument the intabulation is intended for, and idiomatic ornaments are sometimes added. Intabulations are an important source of information for historically informed performance because they show ornaments as they would have been played on various instruments, and they are a huge clue as to the actual performance of musica ficta, since tablature shows where a musician places their fingers, which is less up to interpretation than certain staff notations.

The film stars Jeffrey Donovan, Samantha Mathis, and Bruce Dern. The film was shot in various locations in New Mexico. The film is based on the novel Brief Garland by Harold Keith. The novel is about Keith's real life nephew, Jim Keith. Plot Clay Driscoll, a young coach from Louisiana with dreams of being the head coach of a successful boys' basketball team, is hired by an Oklahoma superintendent to coach basketball. Driscoll immediately finds himself in conflict with the head of the school board, Ellis Brawley, who is also the great-great grandson of the town's founder, the owner of the bank, and the most influential man in the town. The superintendent did not ask Brawley about the hire, and now is off recovering from a medical condition. Brawley has hired another man to coach the schools' boys' basketball team, and has relegated newcomer Driscoll to the unenviable job of coaching the girls' team. Early 1960s Oklahoma is in the midst of a drought, and the school and town are facing economic distress. High school sports are an integral part of the town's fabric and pride, but girls' sports are an afterthought and receive little attention. The girls' team is more akin to a gym class than a basketball program. Clay is crushed by the news that the job he came for has gone to “someone more qualified”, and he sees no future in coaching the girls. With his future uncertain, Driscoll begins his task of coaching the girls' team with little understanding of his players. Saying he only knows how to coach one way, he addresses his girls with the same discipline and determination he would with a boys' team, but is bewildered at times by their rigid interpretation of his direction. He is often at a loss to deal with their play and their reactions to his coaching. With the support, encouragement and insight of his wife Jean, he is able to understand the girls he is coaching and reach them. Unbeknownst to Driscoll, his drive and commitment to win is infectious. The girls accept what he asks of them, and they become committed to working hard to be as good as they can be. With the first year behind him and an offer to assist a boys' team at another school, Clay decides to stay on and coach the Lady Cyclones. The following year his team shows a marked improvement, and they become a tough team to beat.

Overview The foundation of Queen's Park in 1867 had begun to put football, which had persisted in various wholly unorganised recreational forms for centuries, on a more organised basis. A number of other clubs had come into being, occasionally playing challenge matches against each other, but as yet no governing body for the game or organised competitions existed within Scotland. In England, the Football Association (FA) had been in existence since 1863, and in 1871–72 it staged the first ever FA Cup competition. As it was not yet apparent that the FA and its Cup would become primarily English (as opposed to British even worldwide), Queen's Park were invited to enter. On the international front, official and fully representative matches had yet to be organised. A series of \\"England v Scotland\\" matches in London organised by C. W. Alcock had begun in 1870, however the Scottish sides were almost entirely selected from London residents, these matches are not officially recognised. It would be November 1872 before the first recognised international fixture took place. FA Cup Without any precedents to draw on, the first FA Cup was organised on a haphazard basis, as illustrated by Queen's Park's progress. They were drawn in the first round to play Donington School from Lincolnshire, the only other entrants from outwith the Home Counties, but when the clubs were unable to agree a date for the fixture, the FA permitted both to progress to the next round. This time they were paired again, but Donington withdrew from the competition. With five teams left in the competition, Queen's were awarded a bye into the semi-finals, still without having played a match. The semi-final draw paired Queen's Park with Wanderers, and after raising money by public subscription the Scots travelled to London, where a goalless draw was secured at Kennington Oval. Queen's, however, could not afford to extend their stay long enough for the tie to be replayed and were forced to withdraw from the competition.

Pallet jacks are the most basic form of a forkliftThe Forklift Manual and are intended to move pallets within a warehouse.  Operational principle  The jack is steered by a 'tiller' like lever that also acts as the pump handle for raising the jack. A small handle on the tiller releases the hydraulic fluid, causing the forks to lower. The front wheels inside the end of the forks are mounted on levers attached to linkages that go to levers attached to the jack cylinder. As the hydraulic jack at the 'tiller' end is raised, the links force the wheels down, raising the forks vertically above the front wheels, raising the load upward until it clears the floor. The pallet is only lifted enough to clear the floor for subsequent travel. Oftentimes, pallet jacks are used to move and organize pallets inside a trailer, especially when there is no forklift truck access or availability. A jack typically has steering wheels in the front, while each fork usually has either a single wheel or two bogie wheels.  History  Manual pallet jacks have existed since at least 1918. Early types lifted the forks and load only by mechanical linkages. More modern type uses a hand pumped hydraulic jack to lift. Types Manual pallet jack A manual pallet jack is a hand- powered jack most commonly seen in retail and personal warehousing operations. They are used predominantly for lifting, lowering and steering pallets from one place to another. Powered pallet jack An electric pallet jack. The recharging lead can be seen. Powered pallet jacks,How to Choose a Pallet Jack  http://www.rackexpress.com/how-to-choose-a-pallet-jack/ also known as electric pallet trucks, walkies, single or double pallet jacks, or power jack, are motorized to allow lifting and moving of heavier and stacked pallets. Some contain a platform for the user to stand while moving pallets. The powered pallet jack is generally moved by a throttle on the handle to move forward or in reverse and steered by swinging the handle in the intended direction. Some contain a type of dead man's switch rather than a brake to stop the machine should the user need to stop quickly or leave the machine while it is in use. Others use a system known as \\"plugging\\" wherein the driver turns the throttle from forward to reverse (or vice versa) to slow and stop the machine, as the dead man's switch is used in emergencies only. Rough terrain pallet jack Rough terrain pallet jacksRough Terrain Pallet Jack  https://www.palletrucks- trolleys.com/news/post/conquer-any-surface-with-our-rough-terrain-pallet- trucks are designed specifically for use on uneven ground. They are made using heavy-duty frames and robust pneumatic tyres so that they can be manoeuvred over rough surfaces with ease. Many manufacturers opt for watertight wheel bearings, a hydraulic elevator or a built-in pump to ensure their rough terrain pallet jacks are easy and comfortable to use, even in the harshest conditions. Operational limitations * Reversible pallets cannot be used. * Double-faced non-reversible pallets cannot have deck-boards where the front wheels extend to the floor. * Enables only two-way entry into a four-way notched-stringer pallet, because the forks cannot be inserted into the notches. Typical dimensions Industry seems to have 'standardized' pallet jacks in several ways: * Width of each of two Forks: 7\\" (17.78 cm) * Fork Width, i.e. The dimension between the outer edges of the forks: Available as 20¼\\" (51.4 cm) and 27\\" (68.6 cm) * Fork Length: Available as 36\\" (91.4 cm), 42\\" (106.7 cm), 48\\" (122 cm) * Lowered Height: 2.9\\" (7.5 cm) * Raised Height: At least 7.5\\" (19.1), but some will raise higher In Eurasia the overall dimensions are similar, as modern container palletization has forced standardization in the dimensional domain globally.

It is located in Santa Clara, California. The parish community of St. Clare originated from the Mission Santa Clara de Asís and can trace its history to Jan 12, 1777, when Fathers Thomas de la Pena and Joseph Anthony de Murguia celebrated Mass on the west bank of Santa Clara's Guadalupe River. St. Clare Parish was built to take over the parochial functions of the Mission Santa Clara de Asís after it burned in 1925. The parish was built later that same year one block west of the Mission on Lexington Street. Archbishiop Edward Hanna constituted the mission for non-parochial services for college students and the parochial powers of the church pass to St. Clare's Church built by Father George Bulter. Father Bulter ordered a statue of the Blessed Mother from Rome. It was dedicated along with the church in a ceremony where parishioners gathered in front of the Mission and carried the statue in a procession across the street to the new St Clare church on August 15, 1926 (four days after the feast day of St. Clare). The Mission was rebuilt in 1928 and is now used as the chapel for the Santa Clara University. The parish also assumed control of the Saint Clare School located next door and founded in 1856. St. Clare's church celebrated its 200th anniversary on Sunday, April 17, 1977 with a 12:15 PM mass officiated by Archbishop Joseph McGucken and a reception dinner and dancing at Santa Clara's Benson Center.

(The latitude of Orangefield is 30.074N. The longitude is -93.855W). In 1913, the town began to develop around the oilfield just west of Orange, and its name was derived from being called the \\"Orange Oil Field\\" which was later shorted to \\"Orangefield\\". After a major producing well was discovered in August 1913, a post office was established for Orangefield in 1922.Handbook of Texas Online - ORANGEFIELD, TX It was a small community of farmers before the discovery of oil. A few rice farms and marshes were what lived in the area between Orange, Bridge City, and Vidor. The rice crop planted in the area was linked to W.R. Hill possibly as early as 1888. Immigrant farmers made up much of the population in the area that was divided into three different communities. The communities fell under the names Oilla, Terry, and Duncan's Woods. It's not really known when the name Orangefied actually formed, but it was sometime after the first oil well struck.Kevin Carmody, \\"Orangefield Experienced Two Oil Booms,\\" Las Sabinas Vol XVII, Book 3 (1991): 69 Many farmers allowed oil wells to be dug on their properties, especially since they still owned the mineral rights. The Bland oil well was the first to strike oil in 1913. It received the name \\"Old Faithful,\\" because it was said to \\"head like Old Faithful every 50 minutes.\\" Wildcatters from all over raced to the area after the news of the Bland well. The discovery of oil in Orange County raised a lot of hopes. These hopes began to dwindle during the ten years until the true boom commenced.Nina Harden, \\"The Orange Oil Field\\", Las Sabinas Vol. V Book 4 (Winter 1979): 9 By 1927 the boom seemed to be over.Nina Harden, \\"The Orange Oil Field\\", Las Sabinas Vol. V Book 4 (Winter 1979): 11 A second boom in 1937 revived the little town and breathed new life into the dying community. A. H. Montagne and Paul Cormier brought in the new boom when they hit a nice major oil pocket. Montagne was quoted as saying about Cormier, \\"The man just found a deeper well. He gambled and hit.\\" The population once again shot through the roof during this second boom . The depression was eased on a lot of people living in Orangefield because of this second boom. Work was readily available in the oilfields for those who were willing. There were not many that would not be willing to work in the oilfields during that time. Farmers whose crops failed would change profession to save their families and farms.

This was Day's final album for Columbia, and her last album of previously unissued material until 1994. The album gets its title from Doris Day's first big hit, \\"Sentimental Journey,\\" which she performed as a part of the band Les Brown and His Band of Renown in 1945, and was re-recorded for this album. Other tracks on the album consist mostly of pop standards, principally composed in the 1940s, approximately contemporaneously with the title track. Liner notes on the album were written by George T. Simon who was the author of \\"The Feeling of Jazz\\". The album's tracks are backed with the lush arrangements from the Mort Garson Orchestra. Mort Garson arranged and conducted. All of the album tracks are medium to slow tempo. The album was produced by Allen Stanton. Though this was her last Columbia album, Day would continue to record for Columbia through mid-1967, issuing singles in 1966 and '67 and recording a number of tracks in 1967 for a projected new album. However, the planned album was shelved, and Day subsequently left Columbia (and essentially the recording industry) in 1967. Day's next release was not until 1994, and consisted of tracks from the shelved 1967 sessions. Doris Day's Sentimental Journey was re- issued in 2001, combined with Latin for Lovers, as a CD. 'A Sentimental Journey' is also the title of a stage musical tribute to Doris Day by Adam Rollston. In 2011 the piece toured to Scotland, England and Los Angeles.

It opened in 1956 as the first major museum collection in the country to be formed by state legislation and funding. Since the initial 1947 appropriation that established its collection, the Museum has continued to be a model of enlightened public policy with free admission to the permanent collection. Today, it encompasses a collection that spans more than 5,000 years of artistic work from antiquity to the present, an amphitheater for outdoor performances, and a variety of celebrated exhibitions and public programs. The Museum features over 40 galleries as well as more than a dozen major works of art in the nation's largest museum park with 164-acres (0.66 km2). One of the leading art museums in the American South, the NCMA recently completed a major expansion winning international acclaim for innovative approaches to energy-efficient design. History In 1924, the North Carolina State Art Society formed to generate interest in creating an art museum for the state. In 1928 the society acquired funds and 75 paintings were first displayed in a series of temporary art exhibition spaces in the Agriculture Building in Raleigh in 1929. In 1939, NCMA was moved to the former Supreme Court building. In 1947 the state legislature appropriated $1 million to purchase a collection of artworks for the people of North Carolina. The money was used to purchase 139 European and American works. The Samuel H. Kress Foundation matched the appropriation with a gift of 71 works, primarily from the Italian Renaissance. The 1947 state earmarking of funds for an art collection was the first in the United States. Morgan Street Location On April 6, 1956, the museum opened in the renovated State Highway Division Building on Morgan Street in downtown Raleigh, the state capital. W. R. Valentiner became the museum's first director. In 1961, the legislature separated the museum from the Art Society, making it a state agency jointly governed by the state and a board of trustees. Ten years later, NCMA became an entity under what is now the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources. Blue Ridge Road and the Stone Building In 1967, the present- day Blue Ridge Road site was chosen as the location for a new building, as the museum had outgrown the Morgan Street location. Designed by Edward Durrell Stone and Associates of New York and Holloway-Reeves Architects of North Carolina, the new building opened in 1983. Stone used spatial experimentation with pure geometric form for the museum by using a square as a basic unit and designing the entire site by manipulating the square form. This was Stone's last major design prior to his death. After he died in 1978, the exterior was changed from white marble to red brick. Expansion In April 2010 the museum opened the new West Building, designed by New York-based architects Thomas Phifer and Partners as part of an expansion initiative. The single- story structure, surrounded by sculpture gardens and pools, was created to feature the museum's permanent collection as well as more than 100 new works of art acquired on the occasion of the expansion. Highlights include a gift of 30 Auguste Rodin sculptures and work by artists Roxy Paine, Ursula von Rydingsvard, El Anatsui, Jaume Plensa, Jackie Ferrara, Ellsworth Kelly, and David Park. The project also transformed the museum's East Building into a center for temporary exhibitions, education and public programs, public events, and administrative functions. The project cost $72.3 million. The exterior walls of the West Building are covered with anodized aluminum panels that are canted two degrees back from vertical with seams covered by highly polished steel bands. The roof of the West Building includes parabolic-shaped by coffers, which admit natural light. Permanent collection Ancient Greek Hydria at North Carolina Museum of Art The museum's permanent collection includes European paintings from the Renaissance to the 19th century, Egyptian funerary art, sculpture and vase painting from ancient Greece and Rome, American art of the 18th through 20th centuries, and international contemporary art. Other strengths include African, ancient American, pre- Columbian, and Oceanic art, and Jewish ceremonial objects. African The museum's African collection originated in the 1970s with historical material from the 19th and 20th centuries, including important items from the Benin Kingdom. Later acquisitions expanded regional coverage to include other parts of sub-Saharan Africa with an eye toward assembling works that demonstrated a particular ethnic style, such as those of the Chokwe and Luba peoples of central Africa. Though much of the collection is rooted in traditional media such as wood, metal, and textiles and derives from established creative traditions, many works date from the mid-20th century and give insight into global exchanges that have taken place on the continent for centuries. American The museum's American art collection encompasses paintings and sculpture from the late colonial period (mid-18th century) to the advent of modern art in the early 20th century, beginning with three imposing portraits by John Singleton Copley and concluding with paintings by leading American impressionists. In between, the collection addresses many of the themes and subjects of American art history, such as the celebration of wilderness and the search for a national identity; the conflicts over race, immigration, and social class; and the rapid evolution of society from Jefferson's republic of farmers to Rockefeller's industrial dynamo. In December 2018, the museum acquired the 1865 sculpture Saul by William Wetmore Story. Ancient American The ancient American collection features art from three distinct areas of the Western Hemisphere: Mesoamerica, Central America, and the Andes. The ancient American gallery focuses on Mesoamerica, particularly the art of the ancient Maya. Known for their achievements in science and the arts, the Maya dominated the region for most of two millennia. The museum's collection reflects their religious beliefs, sport, ritual, and daily life. Egyptian Although comprising only 38 artifacts, the ancient Egyptian art collection at the North Carolina Museum of Art represents the major periods of ancient Egyptian history, from the Predynastic (Nagada I, 4000–3500 BCE) to the Roman (30 BCE – 642 CE) periods. The Museum's oldest artifact is a black- topped red ceramic jar handmade approximately 6,000 years ago. All periods combined, the collection's strength resides in funerary material, which includes the painted coffins of Djed Mut and Amunred, servant statues for chores in the afterlife (called shabtis), and a canopic jar that once contained the mummified liver of a man named Qeny. The remainder of the collection focuses on the many gods worshiped in Egypt. European European paintings at North Carolina Museum of Art The museum's strength lies in its European collection. Of the 139 paintings and sculptures purchased with the original appropriation of funds, 123 were European. When these paintings were augmented by the 75 primarily Italian paintings and sculptures given to the museum by the Samuel H. Kress Foundation in 1961, they created a European collection that is recognized as one of the finest in the United States. The gallery is primarily a collection of paintings but also includes a number of noteworthy sculptures, including more than 30 bronzes by Auguste Rodin. British, Spanish, and French Post–1600 The museum possesses a number of British portraits, most of which are installed in a gallery devoted to European portraiture and its early American counterpart. The collection features important works by Paul van Somer, Anthony van Dyck, Francis Cotes, Sir William Beechey, Thomas Gainsborough, and Sir Henry Raeburn. The museum's French and Spanish collections include portraits and still lifes by Boudin, Millet, Pissarro, and Monet. Italian The museum's collection of Italian paintings is one of its most robust. Highlights include a gallery devoted to altarpieces and devotional works from the 16th through 18th centuries, paintings by Titian and Raphael, and 17th-century baroque art. Northern European The museum's Northern European collection comprises a small but select group of Northern Renaissance paintings and sculptures, an important collection of 17th-century Dutch and Flemish paintings, and a Flemish baroque kunstkamer inspired by 17th-century examples. The 17th-century Dutch and Flemish collections are larger in number and include works by Hendrick Ter Brugghen, Jan Steen, Jan Lievens, Jacob van Ruisdael, and Govaert Flinck, Jan Brueghel the Elder, Peter Paul Rubens, Gerard Seghers, Anthony van Dyck, Jacob Jordaens, and Frans Snyders. Modern (to circa 1960) In West Building the museum's modern collection occupies several rooms with works by the foremost German modern artists of the early 20th century such as Franz Kline and Lyonel Feininger as well first generation of American modernists such as Alberto Giacometti. Cubist and surrealist pieces by Paul Delvaux and Joseph Cornell as well as other Modern masters such as Richard Diebenkorn, Andrew Wyeth, and Alberto Giacometti. Judaic Menorah In the Judaic Section The museum's Judaic art collection celebrates the spiritual life and ceremonies of the Jewish people through ritual objects of artistic excellence. It is one of only two galleries devoted to Judaica in an American art museum. The Judaic Art Gallery features objects from the major Jewish traditions—Ashkenazic, Sephardic, and Oriental—as well as from modern Israel. All objects are designed for use in synagogue worship, observance of the Sabbath and holidays, or ceremonial occasions honoring the life cycle and Jewish home. Examples of objects that are displayed include a Menorah and Torah scrolls. Contemporary In recent years major acquisitions have helped build a significant collection of contemporary art. A concerted effort has been made to acquire works in new and experimental media, such as Bill Viola’s video The Quintet of Remembrance (2000) and Michal Rovner’s video installation Tfila (2004). Cultural and regional representation has also been expanded, with the museum actively acquiring works by artists of diverse backgrounds. In 2003, the museum started actively collecting contemporary photography. By 2010, the collection totaled over 200 photographs by national and international photographers, including works by Rosemary Laing, Dinh Q. Lê, Vera Lutter, and Lorna Simpson. Recent acquisitions include Hank Willis Thomas, Kehinde Wiley, and Mickalene Thomas. Two identical figures, each with the dimensions of 377×235×245 cm, were recently set up in the museum's garden. Their title is Spiegel I and Spiegel II. They were created from white painted stainless steel in 2010 by the Spanish sculptor and artist Jaume Plensa. The collection also includes a comprehensive survey of North Carolina artists. Museum Park Encompassing of fields, woodlands, and creeks, the Museum Park features more than a dozen site-specific works of art and two miles (3 km) of trails. The campus is the largest museum art park in North America. In the warm weather months, outdoor movies and concerts are presented at the Joseph M. Bryan, Jr., Theater. \\"gyre\\" by Raleigh-based artist Thomas Sayre The museum's contemporary art program extends into the landscape surrounding the museum, where artists have created both temporary and permanent site-specific works of art in the Museum Park. , art on view in the Park includes works by Thomas Sayre, Vollis Simpson, Martha Jackson-Jarvis, Ledelle Moe and a camera obscura entitled Cloud Chamber for the Trees and Sky by Chris Drury. Other outdoor sculptures—Ronald Bladen's Three Elements, Henry Moore's Large Spindle Piece and Large Standing Figure: Knife Edge—are installed in the gardens surrounding West Building. Picture This, part of the museum's amphitheater, is a monumental work of art designed by artist Barbara Kruger in collaboration with architects and landscape architects. Sculptures At Museum's Park Exhibitions Since renovations in 2010, the East Building provides a series of rotating exhibitions featuring a NC gallery, a photography gallery, education exhibitions, and at least two traveling or temporary exhibitions on display.

Other areas of application of TAU include the automation of starting and reconciling teller or cashier drawers (tills) in retail, check cashing, payday loan / advance, grocery, and casino operations. Cash supplies are held in a vault or safe. Disbursements and acceptance of money take place by means of inputting information through a separate computer to the cash dispensing mechanism inside the vault, which is similar in construction to an automatic teller machine vault. A TAU provides a secure and auditable way of handling large amounts of cash by tellers without undue risk from robbery. Some TAUs can be networked and monitored remotely, from a central location - thereby reducing oversight and management resources. Special security considerations TAUs may delay dispensing of large amounts of money up to minutes to discourage bank robberies. It is however very likely that someone present on the premises has the means to open the cash vault of the device. TAUs may be accessed by keys, combination, or a mix of the two. Construction A TAU consists of: * A vault * Cash handling mechanism * Alarm sensors In the TAU's cash handling mechanisms are several money cartridges. These can be equipped with different cash notes or coinage. The input into the controlling computer makes possible for this unit to disburse the correct amounts. Notes are tested to ensure that they are removed correctly from the cartridges and that no surplus notes are removed. False disbursements are possible, although very rare. Modern TAUs can be used also for depositing and recycling of banknotes. They use bill validation technology to help ensure the authenticity and fitness of the received cash before it is accepted and recycled to be presented to the customer. Differences from ATMs TAUs are distinct from ATMs in that they are designed to be operated solely by trained branch personnel, they do not integrate directly into interbank networks, and are usually controlled by a computer that is not directly integrated into the overall construction of the unit.

These virtual hosts can be configured to mimic several different types of servers, allowing the user to simulate an infinite number of computer network configurations. Honeyd is primarily used in the field of computer security.  Primary Applications   Distraction  Honeyd is used primarily for two purposes. Using the software's ability to mimic many different network hosts at once (up to 65536 hosts at once), Honeyd can act as a distraction to potential hackers. If a network only has 3 real servers, but one server is running Honeyd, the network will appear running hundreds of servers to a hacker. The hacker will then have to do more research (possibly through social engineering) in order to determine which servers are real, or the hacker may get caught in a honeypot. Either way, the hacker will be slowed down or possibly caught.  Honeypot  Honeyd gets its name for its ability to be used as a honeypot. On a network, all normal traffic should be to and from valid servers only. Thus, a network administrator running Honeyd can monitor his/her logs to see if there is any traffic going to the virtual hosts set up by Honeyd. Any traffic going to these virtual servers can be considered highly suspicious. The network administrator can then take preventative action, perhaps by blocking the suspicious IP address or by further monitoring the network for suspicious traffic.

She was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for Orlando, Florida. Construction She was authorized with the hull classification symbol PG-207 but reclassified PF-99 in April 1943. Her keel was laid down 2 August 1943, under a Maritime Commission Contract by American Ship Building Company, in Cleveland, Ohio. She was launched on 1 December 1943, sponsored by Mrs. E. Harold Johnson, and commissioned on 15 November 1944, with Lieutenant Commander James A. Hyslop, USCG, in command. Service history After Orlando made a shakedown cruise to Bermuda, her first convoy departed from Hampton Roads on 7 February 1945. Orlando rounded up the stragglers from her position in the rear of the 37-ship convoy bound for Mers el Kebir, Algeria. The convoy passed through the Strait of Gibraltar on 22 February and arrived at Mers el Kebir two days later. On 3 March escort duty commenced again as a 43-ship convoy started on its way across the Atlantic Ocean. By 15 March various units of the convoy began to detach themselves from the main body of ships and Orlando departed the convoy to proceed to Boston, Massachusetts. After training exercises Orlando commenced her second trans-Atlantic voyage to Mers el Kebir as part of a convoy screen. The ship remained at Mers el Kebir until joining a convoy bound for the United States on 2 May. With the crossing completed, the convoy commenced to break up on 14 May and Orlando returned to New York City with a section of the convoy before proceeding to Boston for voyage repairs. On 5 July Orlando departed for New York to be converted to a weather ship and prepare for distant service. The frigate got underway from New York Harbor 10 August bound for the Panama Canal. On the way the successful conclusion of the war against Japan was announced. The ship transited the Panama Canal and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 5 September 1945. Five days later Orlando and stood out of the channel at Pearl Harbor and set course for Adak in the Andreanof Islands to moor in Sweepers Cove, Adak on 16 September. The ship took a weather station in the area around 43 degrees North, 165 degrees East from 7 October until 25 October. Through the month of November the ship was moored in Finger Bay, Adak. The lonely weather station duty continued as Orlando remained in the area around Adak until arriving at Seattle, Washington, on 12 May 1946. The naval career of the frigate Orlando ended at Seattle where she was taken out of commission 27 June 1946. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 19 July 1946, and was sold for scrapping 10 November 1947 to the Zidell Ship Dismantling Company. In popular culture In the 1973 film Cinderella Liberty, James Caan portrayed a sailor assigned to USS Orlando and wore the ship's name on his right shoulder rocker. Additionally, a submarine named the USS Orlando played a major role in the 1996 film Down Periscope. Both ships are unrelated to the actual USS Orlando except in name only.

The village consists of two parts: Wardington and Upper Wardington. The village is on a stream that rises in Upper Wardington and flows north to join the River Cherwell. The parish includes the hamlet of Williamscot, about southwest of Wardington. The parish is bounded to the west and north by the River Cherwell, to the south by a stream that joins the Cherwell, and to the northeast by field boundaries. Its northeastern and southern boundaries also form part of the county boundary with Northamptonshire. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 602. Toponym A hundred roll from AD 1279 records the toponym as Wardinton. Its etymology is Old English but its meaning is uncertain. \\"Ward\\" may be derived from a person called Wearda, or it may be from the Old English wearde or wearda meaning a beacon or cairn. The suffix -ingtūn is very common in Old and Middle English but its meaning is disputed. Manor Wardington Manor in 2015 The Domesday Book of 1086 records Wardington as part of the Cropredy manor of Remigius de Fécamp, Bishop of Lincoln. Between Wardington and Upper Wardington is Wardington Manor house, which dates from the middle of the 16th century or possibly earlier. The house was remodelled in 1665 and twice early in the 20th century. From 1917 Wardington Manor was the seat of Baron Wardington. In 2004 the house was severely damaged by fire but it has since been restored. It is a Grade II* listed building. Church and chapel Church of England The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary Magdalene has a 12th-century chancel and 13th-century nave. In the 14th century new Decorated Gothic windows were added to the chancel. In the 15th century a Perpendicular Gothic clerestory was added to the nave and a west tower was built. Monuments in the church include two 14th-century tomb recesses and a 14th-century slab with a foliated cross. There is a 15th-century monumental brass to Henry Freebody, who died in 1444. In the south chapel is an 18th-century monument to George Denton, who died in 1757. The church was restored in 1887 and 1889 under the direction of the Gothic Revival architect Ewan Christian, and again in 1912–14 under the direction of WT Loveday. St Margaret's is a Grade I listed building. The tower has a ring of six bells. Henry I Bagley of Chacombe cast the oldest in 1669, Henry II Bagley cast the tenor bell in 1682 and Henry II and Matthew I Bagley cast the treble bell in 1685. John Briant of Hertford cast two more of the bells in 1791 and 1795. John Taylor cast the youngest bell in 1841, presumably at his then foundry in Oxford. St Mary Magdalene parish is now part of the Benefice of Shires' Edge along with those of Claydon, Cropredy, Great Bourton and Mollington. Former Wesleyan chapel in Upper Wardington Methodist A congregation of Wesleyans was established in the village by 1815 and had built a chapel by 1827. In 1895 a larger chapel was built in a Gothic Revival style next to the old one, which was sold to the owner of the manor house. The chapel was part of the Methodist Union of 1932, and was still open as part of Banbury Methodist Circuit in 1964. It has since closed and been converted into private homes. Social and economic history In 1469 in the Wars of the Roses the Battle of Edgecote Moor was fought near Wardington. In 1644 in the English Civil War the Battle of Cropredy Bridge was fought across the parishes of Bourton, Cropredy, Prescote and Wardington. The site is now on the Register of Historic Battlefields. Williamscot House is Elizabethan, built for Walter Calcott in about 1568. A Queene Anne style wing was added in 1704 and extended in Georgian style in 1777. The Elizabethan part of the house is now Grade II* listed. Former parish school in Wardington, closed in 1991 and now a private house From 1574 Wardington was served by the Free School northeast of Williamscot House. The Free School was closed in 1857 but the building survives. By 1833 a school had been established at Wardington itself. This became a National School and acquired its own purpose-built premises in 1845. After 1947 it became a primary school, with children older than 11 being schooled in Banbury. The school was closed in 1991 and is now a private house. In 1753 Wardington had three public houses: the Green Man, the Hare and Hounds and the Wheatsheaf, also called the White Swan and the White Lion. The Green Man seems to have ceased trading by 1787. In 1966 Upper Wardington had two public houses: the Plough and the Red Lion. Today only the Hare and Hounds remains in business, as the others have been converted into private homes. In 1900 the Great Central Railway's branch line between and was built through the southern edge of Wardington parish. In 1911 the railway opened more than a mile south of the village on Wardington Road. British Railways closed the halt in 1956 and the line in 1966. Wardington Memorial Hall was built in 1920 as a monument to members of the village who were killed serving in the First World War.

Northamptonshire County Council's Transport Prioritisation Framework includes plans for an A361 bypass of Wardington, Chipping Warden and Byfield. Since 2011 Stagecoach in Oxfordshire has operated bus route 200 between Banbury and Daventry via Wardington, running hourly from Mondays to Saturdays. There is no Sunday or bank holiday service. Until 2011 Geoff Amos Coaches of Eydon had run a Monday to Saturday bus service between Rugby and Banbury via Daventry and Wardington. In April 2011 Northamptonshire County Council reduced its English National Concessionary Travel Scheme payment to bus operators from 53 pence to 38 pence per passenger and Geoff Amos Coaches warned that this would threaten the viability of its bus services. On 4 August 2011 Geoff Amos Coaches announced the withdrawal of its scheduled bus services with effect from 5 August until further notice.

An oil well on fire in Iraq Oil well fires are oil or gas wells that have caught on fire and burn. Oil well fires can be the result of human actions, such as accidents or arson, or natural events, such as lightning. They can exist on a small scale, such as an oil field spill catching fire, or on a huge scale, as in geyser-like jets of flames from ignited high pressure wells. A frequent cause of a well fire is a high-pressure blowout during drilling operations. Extinguishing the fires Kuwaiti firefighters fight to secure a burning oil well in the Iraqi Rumaila oilfields in 2003. F-16s and F-15s fly past burning oil wells in Kuwait during Operation Desert Storm, 1991 Oil well fires are more difficult to extinguish than regular fires due to the enormous fuel supply for the fire. In fighting a fire at a wellhead, typically high explosives, such as dynamite, are used to create a shockwave that pushes the burning fuel and local atmospheric oxygen away from a well. (This is a similar principle to blowing out a candle.) The flame is removed and the fuel can continue to spill out without catching fire. After blowing out the fire, the wellhead must be capped to stop the flow of oil. During this time, copious fuel and oxygen are present; any spark or other heat source might ignite a fire worse than the original blowout. Thus brass tools, bronze tools, or paraffin wax-coated toolswhich do not strike sparksare used in capping. Some of the technology used by Red Adair to seal some of the Kuwait oil fires without re-igniting the flow of oil, originated in a patent by John R. Duncan (United States Patent 3,108,499 filed September 28, 1960, granted October 29,1963), a method and apparatus for severing section of fluid pipeline therefrom. The patent was granted a year after Red Adair's success in combating the Devil's Cigarette Lighter gas well fire. The invention is concerned with removing a section of a fluid pipeline and inserting a valve or other component therein without destroying line pressure and without losing any significant amount of fluid passing through the pipeline. With recent advances in technology as well as environmental concerns, many straight forward well fires today are capped while they burn. There are several techniques used to put out oil well fires, which vary by resources available and the characteristics of the fire itself. In essence the trade was started by Myron M. Kinley, who dominated the field in the early years. His lieutenant, Red Adair, went on to become the most famous of oil well firefighters. Techniques include:John Wright Company Technical Library resource on blowout control * Dousing with copious amounts of water. According to Larry H. Flak, a petroleum engineer for Boots and Coots International Well Control, 90% of all the 1991 fires in Kuwait were put out with nothing but sea water, sprayed from powerful hoses at the base of the fire. * Using a gas turbine to blast a fine mist of water at the base of the fire. Water is injected behind the exhaust of the turbine in large quantities. This proved popular with tackling stubborn fires in the Kuwait oil fires (1991) and was brought to the region by Hungarians equipped with MiG-21 engines mounted on a tank, either a T-34 or T-62.Husain, T., Kuwaiti Oil Fires: Regional Environmental Perspectives, 1st ed. Oxford, UK:BPC Wheatons Ltd, 1995, p. 51. Based on a Russian idea, the Hungarian vehicle, named \\"Big Wind\\", was influenced by a similar concept used in Soviet times for extinguishing blown out gas- and oil-well fires and clearing snow off airfields by using a single MiG-15 jet engine bolted onto the bed of a truck. However, in this incarnation, it was not always powerful enough to defeat large fires, although it was also brought to and used in Kuwait; to tackle more resilient fires MB Drilling Company constructed \\"Big Wind\\" with two more powerful jet engines fixed to the more-stable chassis of a tank. The IMAX documentary Fires of Kuwait follows the numerous companies, and their methods, employed with the task of extinguishing the fires, with footage of the Hungarian \\"Big Wind\\" in action contained in the film. * Using dynamite to \\"blow out\\" the fire by forcing the burning fuel and oxygen away from the fuel source. This was one of the earliest effective methods and is still widely used. The first use was by Myron Kinley's father in California in 1913.\\"The Fire Beater,\\" Time Generally explosives are placed within 55 gallon drums, the explosives are surrounded by fire retardant chemicals, and then the drums are wrapped with insulating material. A horizontal crane is used to bring the drum as close to the wellhead as possible. This method was depicted in the 1968 film Hellfighters starring John Wayne. * Dry Chemical (mainly Purple K) can be used on small well fires. * In the 1930s mechanical jaws were developed to clamp off the pipe below the fire, but they are seldom used today. The design became the basis for a safety device used on offshore wells.\\"Oil-Well Fire Squeezed Out As Jaws Close Casing\\" Popular Mechanics, July 1935 * Special vehicles called \\"Athey wagons\\" as well as the typical bulldozer protected by corrugated steel sheeting are normally used in the process.Putting Out an Oil Well Fire * Raising the plume - placing a metal casing 30 to 40 feet high over the wellhead (thus raising the flame above the ground). Liquid nitrogen or water is then forced in at the bottom to reduce the oxygen supply and put out the fire. * The \\"LeRoy Corporation, Houston Oil well Firefighters\\" constructed a machine with an arm that was positioned over an oil well pipe on fire. The machine then lowers a cap over the pipe, extinguishing the flames. LeRoy Ashmore built 3 of these machines and named them Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, for the Biblical characters, who survived death from a fiery furnace. The walls of LeRoy's machines were hollow, allowing water pumped through them to circulate and keep the interior control room water cooled during fire fighting. * Drilling relief wells into the producing zone to redirect some of the oil and make the fire smaller. (However, most relief wells are used to pump heavy mud and cement deep into the wild well.) The first relief wells were drilled in Texas in the mid 1930s.\\"Wild Oil Well Tamed by Scientific Trick\\" Popular Mechanics, July 1934 * Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy, the use of underground nuclear explosions were successfully employed in the former Soviet Union to stop well fires, the high heat of the detonation simultaneously displaces and melts the rock in its vicinity, and with that seals the previously drilled hole. U. S. Department of Energy contract no.: W-7405-Eng48. Effects Oil well fires can cause the loss of millions of barrels of crude oil per day. Combined with the ecological problems caused by the large amounts of smoke and unburnt petroleum falling back to earth, oil well fires such as those seen in Kuwait in 1991 can cause enormous economic losses. Smoke from burnt crude oil contains many chemicals, including sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, soot, benzopyrene, Poly aromatic hydrocarbons, and dioxins.Desk Study on the Environment in Iraq , United Nations Environment Program Exposure to oil well fires is commonly cited as a cause of the Gulf War Syndrome, however, studies have indicated that the firemen who capped the wells did not report any of the symptoms suffered by the soldiers.Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses: Final Report , December 1996 Image:Oil well burning in Bibi Eibat.JPG1904 fire at a Bibi-Eibat oil well.

The idea is that prebiotics may have many different effects in the human gut, some of these may be quantified and combined to an overall score. For example, an increase in the populations of bifidobacteria or lactobacilli coincides with a relative increase in prebiotic activity; accordingly, an increase in enteric bacteria strains such as Clostridium perfringens result in a decrease of prebiotic activity. Also, increases and reductions of certain enzymes may be used as factors in a prebiotic score.  Measure of the prebiotic effect  Measure of the prebiotic effect (MPE) is a quantitative analysis that takes into an account a number of dominant bacterial groups and end products of fermentation such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and substrate assimilation. MPE was developed by Jelena Vulevic in conjunction with Glenn R Gibson and Robert Rastall and sponsored by Novartis Consumer Health  Quantitative approaches  Several quantitative approaches have been developed to aid in the analysis of prebiotics and their individual and collective activity within the gut Microbiome.

It is located east of Radviliškis. Šeduva was an agricultural town dealing in cereals, flax and linseed, pigs and geese and horses, at the site of a royal estate and beside a road from Kaunas to Riga. The population from the fifteenth century was Catholic and Jewish. Until then, Lithuania had been the last pagan kingdom in Europe and allowed freedom of worship and toleration of Jews and other religions. The first Catholic shrine of Šeduva, the Church of the Invention of the Holy Cross, was built and the parish founded between 1512 and 1529. The present brick church Cross was built in Šeduva in 1643 with a donation from bishop Jurgis Tiškevičius of Vilnius. During the 18th century the bell tower was added to the structure, with further renovations and extensions in 1905. Baroque and renaissance architectural styles characterise both the exterior and interior of the church. It has a cruciform plan with an apse, low sacristy and five altars. During the 15th century the region was redefined as the Voivodeship of Trakai and Vilnius. Later it became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania until the Union of Lublin in 1569 created the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Šeduva coat of arms were granted on June 25, 1654 by John II Casimir Vasa, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania and at the same time the city was granted burger rights at the request of Maria Ludvika, Queen of Poland. She descended from the Princes of Gonzaga, from Mantua in Italy. The arms of the family showed a black eagle. The small breastshield shows the French fleur-de-lis, because the Gonzaga family was related to the French Royal family. The eagle was made white in reference to the white eagle of Poland. Evil mill 1792 Stanislaw II August Poniatowski, the last royal proprietor of Šeduva, concluded an agreement with the town's citizens, giving them rights to be excused from labour on the estate for a fee. In 1795, the year of a terrible fire in Šeduva, Lithuania became part of Russia when Poland was partitioned. From 1798, Baron Theodore von Ropp did not acknowledge the rights of Šeduva citizens and required of the citizens to perform labour in the town's manor. The citizens petitioned for their rights to the Russian Senate. In 1812, the Senate passed the decision to recognise the former charters of Šeduva. Šeduva dairy cooperative, 1930s Between 1696 and 1762, a Jesuit mission, connected with their college at Pašiaušė, was active in the town, operating a lower school with 96 pupils up until 1828. After an insurrection in 1863 (the January Uprising), all parish schools in Šeduva were closed and replaced by public Russian language schools. In the same year a Russian Orthodox Church, designed by the architect Ustinas Golinevicius, was built and in 1866 a wooden Synagogue was added near the central market square. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between Nazi Germany and Communist Russia in August 1939 and the German-Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty a month later placed Lithuania under Soviet control. By June 1940 the Soviets had set up a pro-Soviet government and stationed many Red Army troops in Lithuania as part of the Mutual Assistance Pact between the countries. President Antanas Smetona was forced to leave as 15 Red Army divisions came in. The pro-Soviet puppet government was controlled by Vladimir Dekanozov and Justas Paleckis, and Lithuania was made part of the Soviet Union. A Sovietisation programme began immediately. Land, banks and large businesses were nationalised. All religious, cultural, and political organizations were abolished except the Communist party. 17,000 people were deported to Siberia, where many would perish. During the years of Lithuanian anti-Soviet partisan resistance (1944–1953) in Šeduva and neighbouring districts Lithuanian Žalioji rinktinė (The Green Squad), belonging to partisans' Algimantas military district was active. Industry Šeduva is famous for sheep farming, Lithuanian Black-headed sheep are grown. The state enterprise Šeduvos avininkystė is responsible for the preservation of the genetic stock of Lithuanian Black-Headed sheep. The Holocaust in Shadeve The German army invaded Lithuania on 22 June 1941, taking Shadova - Šeduva a few days later as part of Operation Barbarossa. At first the Lithuanian population considered the Nazis to be liberators saving them from the Red Army. Five hundred years of Jewish life in Shadova - Šeduva ended in just two days of slaughter. Shadova's Jews attempted to flee east to Russia but were badly treated by Lithuanian nationalists and most returned to their homes. The German forces entered Shadova - Šeduva on 25 June 1941 and were received with flowers by many locals. By the beginning of July, Jews had to wear the yellow Star of David. Jews who had participated in the Soviet rule were immediately arrested and executed. Jews were taken to dismantle the remnants of the munitions factory in Linkaičiai, and were then accused of stealing and executed. Others were forced into labour gangs. They were set to work cleaning the streets and at the warehouses of the rail station. All the work was guarded by armed Lithuanian militi. Next all the Jews of Shadova - Šeduva had to gather in the market place with no more than a small package each, and to hand over the keys to their houses to the police. Under guard, they were escorted at night to the village of Pavartyčiai, five kilometres north-west of Shadova - Šeduva, where they were crowded into two unfinished Soviet barracks surrounded with barbed wire. The Jews were ordered to hand over all their valuables and cash. Some were shot in the next few days. On 25 August 1941 the remaining Jews of Shadova - Šeduva were loaded on trucks and taken to Liaudiškiai, ten kilometres south-west of the town where the Rollcommando Hamann of Einsatzcommando 3 and Lithuanian collaborators of the 3rd company of the Tautinio Darbo Apsaugos Batalionas were waiting for them. Over the coming two days the entire Jewish community of Shadova was shot and buried in two pre- prepared mass graves. One site was located 400 meters north of the Shadova - Šeduva road and a second 900 meters north west of the same road, close to a path in the forest. The lists of mass graves in the book The Popular Massacres of Lithuania, Part II, include the following: Liaudiskiai forest about 10 km southwest of Šeduva, one site 400 meters north of the Šeduva road and a second site 900 meters northwest of the same road, close to a path in the forest.http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/lithuania3/lit3_003.html#Seduva The Jäger report concludes that Einsatzcommando 3 registered the murder in Šeduva on the 25 and 26 August 1941 of 230 Jewish men, 275 Jewish women and 159 Jewish children, a total of 664 people.

He worked at the college radio station after responding to an ad for a host for a Sunday night jazz program. Professional career Tanter began working at radio station KJLH in Los Angeles in the 1970s, and drove their quiet storm format. Tanter began working as the Lakers' public address announcer at the start of the NBA's 1981-82 season and has been a fixture at Laker home games ever since. He is the longest tenured Lakers PA announcer ever. During his tenure behind the microphones of both The Forum and the Staples Center, Tanter has seen the Lakers win 16 NBA Western Conference titles and 10 NBA championships. When World Wrestling Entertainment fought with the Denver Nuggets over an arena booking for a playoff game in 2009, Tanter was recruited as guest ring announcer for the main event of a newly relocated Raw at Staples Center. In the match, five heel (villain) wrestlers in Denver Nuggets jerseys competed against five face (hero) wrestlers in Los Angeles Lakers jerseys, and the Lakers team won. Soon afterward, the Lakers eliminated the Nuggets in the 2009 Western Conference Finals 4-2. They then went on to defeat the Orlando Magic in the 2009 NBA Finals and capture their 15th NBA title. Tanter played an instrumental role in re-creating a home feel for Lakers \\"home\\" games in the 2020 NBA Bubble, as the league returned to action following a hiatus due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic in the United States.

Early life Ravenscroft was born in 1772 on his family plantation near Petersburg in Prince George County, Virginia, to parents (physician John Ravenscroft and the former Lilias Miller) who were both descendants of the powerful Colonel Robert Bolling. Because their Loyalist sympathies made the political situation unstable, when John was an infant his family moved to Scotland, where he received his earliest education. Upon his father's death in 1788, Ravenscroft returned to Virginia to manage the family lands, as well as pursue their Loyalist indemnification claims. At age 27, he enrolled at the College of William & Mary to prepare for a legal career under the guidance of George Wythe and St. George Tucker. However, the wealthy young man also had extracurricular activities which, with his hot temper, earned him the nickname \\"Mad Jack\\". Eventually, he returned to Scotland to finish settling his father’s estate. Returning again to Virginia, Ravenscroft married well, to Ann Spottswood Burwell, in 1792, and gave up his passions for gambling and horse racing. His wife's father (Col. Lewis Burwell) helped finance construction of their estate near his using locally noteworthy craftsmen Jacob Shelor and John Inge). Soon the Ravenscroft began living at Spring Bank in Lunenburg County. He later claimed that for eighteen years, he \\"never bent his knees in prayer, nor did he once open a Bible.\\" Around 1810 Ravenscroft experienced a religious conversion, and he and Ann joined a group known as \\"Republican Methodists\\". After three years, he was asked to become a leader of the community, but Ann died on August 5, 1815. About a year later, Ravenscroft decided to become a minister, but harbored doubts as to whether every Christian denomination (including the Republican Methodists) were valid and authorized by scriptures, and especially their fitness to perform sacraments. His great grandfather Capt. Samuel Ravenscroft had emigrated to Boston in 1679 and helped found the first Anglican Church in that city. His son (this Ravenscroft's father) Thomas had moved to James City County, and then Prince George County, Virginia where he represented his neighbors in the House of Burgesses as well as acquired land to the south along the Meherrin River and the North Carolina border. This old-line Virginian family had been long members of the Church of England. However, its successor in America, the Episcopal Church was disestablished after the Revolutionary War in both Virginia and North Carolina, and that denomination almost became extinct in the south. Rev. James Craig had retired or left the Meherrin River/Lunenburg County by 1795 and evangelical denominations predominated—Presbyterians led by the Caldwells, Baptists founding the multi-ethnic Meherrin Baptist Church as well as the Cedar Creek Baptist Church, and Methodists visiting the area as part of their Brunswick Circuit included Francis Asbury and Thomas Coke. Nonetheless, as the Second Great Awakening began, Virginia's Episcopal Church was reviving. Richard Channing Moore become its bishop and happily confirmed Ravenscroft as an Episcopalian. Ministry On April 25, 1817, Moore ordained the 45-year-old Ravenscroft as a deacon at the Monumental Church, Richmond, Virginia, and eleven days later advanced him to the priesthood in St. George's Episcopal Church, Fredericksburg. Ravenscroft was assigned a parish near his home: St. James Parish in Boydton, in Mecklenburg County (split off from Lunenburg County) and the terminus of an important plank road to Petersburg. He also remarried, to Sarah, who would also have no children and die on January 15, 1829, about a year before her husband. Meanwhile, Moore, who was also Monumental Church's rector as well as supervised the Episcopal churches in both Virginia and North Carolina, asked Ravenscroft to become his assistant. Ravenscroft probably needed the additional income, for his plantation (which he had increased from 610 acres to over 2100 acres), was foreclosed upon in 1824. However, future bishop of Mississippi William Mercer Green informed Ravenscroft that he had been elected Bishop of the recently re- organized diocese of North Carolina (which adjoined both Lunenberg and Mecklenburg counties)(Charles Pettigrew had been elected its bishop in 1794 but had never been consecrated due to the cancellations of the General Conventions of 1795 and 1798 due to yellow fever and his subsequent infirmities making travel difficult). Although the annual salary offered was just $750, the offer also included the rectorship of Christ Church in Raleigh. Thus, at the General Convention in Old St. Paul's Episcopal Church, Philadelphia, bishops William White, James Kemp and Alexander Griswold, among others, consecrated Ravenscroft as the 20th bishop in the Episcopal Church on May 22, 1823. A dedicated high churchman, but with evangelical spirit, Ravenscroft was known for his booming voice and strident promotion of the Episcopal Church, including his own story of knowing sin and being saved by God's grace. He attended several General Conventions, as well as every diocesan convention. His missionary journeys beginning in 1818 took him over the Cumberland Gap into Tennessee and Kentucky. He confirmed Tennessee's future first bishop, James Hervey Otey, during his 1824 visitation. During his last such trip, on July 1, 1829, he chaired the organizational convention of what eventually became the Episcopal Diocese of Tennessee. Travel or other circumstances, however, took a toll, and in 1828 he gave up the rectorship in Raleigh in favor of the smaller St. John's Church in Williamsboro where his protege Rev. Green lived. Ravenscroft mentored several priests who later became pioneering southern bishops, including Green and Otey, although he also unsuccessfully opposed the consecration of William Meade as Moore's assistant in Virginia in 1829 on the grounds that Meade compromised too much with other Protestant denominations. In December 1824, Ravenscroft gave a sermon to the annual meeting of the Bible Society of North Carolina which caused much controversy because he asserted that the Bible could not be properly studied without a qualified teacher. Ravenscroft then engaged in a theological duel of sorts over the content of his sermon with Presbyterian theology professor John Rice. Not one to mince words, spoken or printed, Ravenscroft published a defense of his beliefs and character in 1826 as The Doctrines of the Church Vindicated from the Misrepresentations of Dr. John Rice, and the Integrity of Revealed Religion Defended against the \\"No Comment Principle\\" of Promiscuous Bible Societies. Ravenscroft also criticized Lutheran theology, and Baptist theology, as well as the notion that a clean life alone assured salvation. Three universities awarded him doctorate of divinity degrees: Columbia University, the College of William & Mary, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Death and legacy After his second wife's death in 1829, Ravenscroft decided to move to Fayetteville, but died at a friend's house in Raleigh en route. He was buried in the chancel of his former church in Raleigh, which was rebuilt several years later. By the time he died, the diocese (which had 3 clergy and 200 laity when organized in 1817 and 7 clergy and 480 communicants when Ravenscroft took office in 1823) had 11 clergymen and 650 lay members. His successor Bishop Levi Silliman Ives (also a high churchman) worked tirelessly to establish a school for boys in the diocese, which was established at Asheville and named after Ravenscroft. After the American Civil War, the Ravenscroft Institute (which by then had a high school for boys and a school for ministry) was reorganized by bishop Atkinson to concentrate on theological training and competed to become a seminary of the Episcopal Church, but lost the competition to University of the South at Sewanee, Tennessee, although the school for boys was reorganized as a private school with a headmaster in the 1880s. His limited papers are held by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and at Duke University, and many published online by Project Canterbury.

The volunteering programme in SCDF was first started in 1982 under the National Civil Defence Plan and Volunteer Scheme which provided an avenue through which residents can volunteer their service in civil defence roles within their local community. However, these volunteer residents were not expected to perform duties to the level that of a professional SCDF officer. In response to the increased threat of terrorism following the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City, there was a growing need to enhance the civil defence capability of the country. In addition, SCDF realised that in the wake of a crisis such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, Nicoll Highway collapse, 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, large scale manpower is required for sustained deployment which will be taxing on its standard regulars. Mobilisation of NS men is not feasible due to impact on economic activity and deemed too heavy a response. As a result, a new form of volunteer organisation, the Civil Defence Auxiliary Unit, was created to provide an immediate pool of ready personnel. Modelled from the Singapore Police Force’s Volunteer Special Constabulary (VSC) scheme of service, members of the CDAU are given the same status and authority of regular SCDF officers. They are expected to perform frontline operational duties alongside regulars. As volunteers, CDAU officers are paid an allowance instead of wages. In April 2006, the Civil Defence Auxiliary Unit (CDAU) was officially launched to provide an avenue for the public to volunteer their service with the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). CDAU comprises volunteers from all walks of life, from professionals to blue-collar executives to even undergraduate, bonded with the same aspiration to serve the nation by complementing the Singapore Civil Defence Force. Donning SCDF uniforms and possessing the same status and powers of SCDF regulars, CDAU officers perform frontline duties alongside regular officers in the areas of fire-fighting & rescue, emergency ambulance service, community involvement, public education. Professionals with the expertise in specialised areas such as Fire Safety, Info-Communications, Chemistry, Life Sciences and Chemical Engineering may enter directly into the Senior Officer scheme. In late 2010, 3 more CDAU vocations are created which are Enforcement Officer, Heritage Gallery Guide and Search Dog Handler. In future, CDAU Officers may also be participating in national events such as NDP, F1 etc. to supplement the regular force. Since 2015, CDAU firefighters scheme is extended to those without prior fire-fighting experience for both male and female. These fresh volunteers must complete a 16-week non-residential fire-fighting course conducted after office hours at Civil Defence Academy. Upon graduation, these volunteer fire-fighters are awarded the fire badge identical to regulars. The first batch graduated in late 2015 becoming the first volunteer fire-fighters in SCDF history. CDAU celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2016.  Recruitment  Since its inception, the target is to reach a pool of about 500 CDAU Officers within 5 years. SCDF holds periodical recruitment via SCDF web portal to attract new candidates. Applicants must meet certain basic physical and academic requirements or can be former SCDF Servicemen. Basic requirements include: 18 years old & above, secondary education. Singapore citizenship or permanent residency, as well as minimum weight and height requirements. Male recruits must have completed full-time NS. Applicants are offered direct entry into any of the 7 vocations. # Fire Fighting & Rescue # Emergency Medical Services # Public Education & Community Involvement # Expertise Group # Enforcement Officer # Heritage Gallery Guide # Search Dog Handler (defunct) # Ops Centre Specialist  Training  Depending on the type of service, non- residentical training is conducted at the Civil Defence Academy (CDA) located at Jalan Bahar or at the Division HQ after office hours or weekends. Upon successful completion of training, CDAU officers will be deployed to the respective Division HQ or Fire Stations.  Service & Deployment  CDAU is not an independent unit but placed subordinate to the different line units. Senior Officers (Lieutenant & Above) and Junior Officers (Senior Warrant Officer & Below) serve at least 24 and 16 hours respectively per month. They are required to serve a minimum of 2 hours per duty. Former SCDF regulars and national servicemen are given their last-held rank subject to approval. Those who are not previously served in SCDF will start with the corporal rank. Like the regulars and NS men, CDAU officers are rewarded similarly for their respective IPPT results. CDAU officers are also eligible for commendations and service medals awarded to their regular counterparts. With effect from November 2016, the hourly allowance increase from $3.60 to $4.60 meant to offset out-of-pocket expenses such as transport and food. As a result of the home team unified rank structure and scheme started in July 2016, new CDAU officers will start off as SGT 1 from July 2017 onwards. Most of the existing CDAU officers holding corporal rank will be emplaced to SGT 1 similarly. CDAU officers can remain active in service as long as he is medically fit, up to the age of 50 for junior officers or 55 for Senior Officers. As CDAU follows SCDF rank structure, auxiliary officers must meet the stringent requirement as their regular counterparts to be eligible for career progression. Similarly to their regular counterpart, CDAUs must clear their annual IPPTs and other mandatory tests required for the respective vocations. Duty in CDAU are not counted as part of reservist liability. CDAU members are also trained in SG Secure initiatives from 2016 onwards.  Attire  Auxiliary officers are issued with either the working or field dress, similar to that of ordinary SCDF officers, to suit their working conditions. Auxiliary officers uses identical equipment with their regular counterparts. Currently, only the difference in epaulette distinguish between ordinary SCDF officers and Auxiliary officers. Auxiliary Officers are allowed to don the respective SCDF decoration identical to their regular counterparts whenever qualified. From April 2014 onwards, CDAU Officers don the similar epaulette as SCDF Officers. CDAU Officers are distinguish by a badge pinned on the top right breast pocket.  Others  CDAU should not be confused with Community Emergency Response Team (CERTs) as the latter is a non-uniformed organisation under People's Association and is only limited to support in its own community with lesser duty obligation. When the Committee to Strengthen National Service (CSNS) report is released in May 2014, CDAU was mentioned. Following that, CDAU was quoted on several media included Minister of Defence speech in Parliament seating.

Magenta arrows denote multiplication, amber denotes addition, silver denotes subtraction and light cyan denotes left shift. (A), (B) and (C) show recursion used to obtain intermediate values. The Karatsuba algorithm is a fast multiplication algorithm. It was discovered by Anatoly Karatsuba in 1960 and published in 1962. Knuth D.E. (1969) The Art of Computer Programming. v.2. Addison-Wesley Publ.Co., 724 pp. It reduces the multiplication of two n-digit numbers to at most n^{\\\\log_23}\\\\approx n^{1.58} single-digit multiplications in general (and exactly n^{\\\\log_23} when n is a power of 2). It is therefore faster than the traditional algorithm, which requires n^2 single-digit products. For example, the Karatsuba algorithm requires 310 = 59,049 single- digit multiplications to multiply two 1024-digit numbers (n = 1024 = 210), whereas the traditional algorithm requires (210)2 = 1,048,576 (a speedup of 17.75 times). The Karatsuba algorithm was the first multiplication algorithm asymptotically faster than the quadratic \\"grade school\\" algorithm. The Toom–Cook algorithm (1963) is a faster generalization of Karatsuba's method, and the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm (1971) is even faster, for sufficiently large n. History The standard procedure for multiplication of two n-digit numbers requires a number of elementary operations proportional to n^2\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, or O(n^2)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! in big-O notation. Andrey Kolmogorov conjectured that the traditional algorithm was asymptotically optimal, meaning that any algorithm for that task would require \\\\Omega(n^2)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! elementary operations. In 1960, Kolmogorov organized a seminar on mathematical problems in cybernetics at the Moscow State University, where he stated the \\\\Omega(n^2)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! conjecture and other problems in the complexity of computation. Within a week, Karatsuba, then a 23-year-old student, found an algorithm (later it was called \\"divide and conquer\\") that multiplies two n-digit numbers in O(n^{\\\\log_2 3}) elementary steps, thus disproving the conjecture. Kolmogorov was very excited about the discovery; he communicated it at the next meeting of the seminar, which was then terminated. Kolmogorov gave some lectures on the Karatsuba result at conferences all over the world (see, for example, \\"Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians 1962\\", pp. 351–356, and also \\"6 Lectures delivered at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Stockholm, 1962\\") and published the method in 1962, in the Proceedings of the USSR Academy of Sciences. The article had been written by Kolmogorov and contained two results on multiplication, Karatsuba's algorithm and a separate result by Yuri Ofman; it listed \\"A. Karatsuba and Yu. Ofman\\" as the authors. Karatsuba only became aware of the paper when he received the reprints from the publisher. Algorithm Basic step The basic step of Karatsuba's algorithm is a formula that allows one to compute the product of two large numbers x and y using three multiplications of smaller numbers, each with about half as many digits as x or y, plus some additions and digit shifts. This basic step is, in fact, a generalization of a similar complex multiplication algorithm, where the imaginary unit is replaced by a power of the base. Let x and y be represented as n-digit strings in some base B. For any positive integer m less than n, one can write the two given numbers as :x = x_1 B^m + x_0, :y = y_1 B^m + y_0, where x_0 and y_0 are less than B^m. The product is then \\\\begin{align} xy &= (x_1 B^m + x_0)(y_1 B^m + y_0) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= z_2 B^{2m} + z_1 B^m + z_0, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} where :z_2 = x_1 y_1, :z_1 = x_1 y_0 + x_0 y_1, :z_0 = x_0 y_0. These formulae require four multiplications and were known to Charles Babbage.Charles Babbage, Chapter VIII – Of the Analytical Engine, Larger Numbers Treated, Passages from the Life of a Philosopher, Longman Green, London, 1864; page 125. Karatsuba observed that xy can be computed in only three multiplications, at the cost of a few extra additions. With z_0 and z_2 as before one can observe that :z_1 = (x_1 + x_0)(y_1 + y_0) - z_2 - z_0. An issue that occurs, however, when computing z_1 is that the above computation of (x_1 + x_0) and (y_1 + y_0) may result in overflow (will produce a result in the range B^m \\\\leq \\\\text{result} < 2 B^m), which require a multiplier having one extra bit. This can be avoided by noting that :z_1 = (x_0 - x_1)(y_1 - y_0) + z_2 + z_0. This computation of (x_0 - x_1) and (y_1 - y_0) will produce a result in the range of -B^m < \\\\text{result} < B^m. This method may produce negative numbers, which require one extra bit to encode signedness, and would still require one extra bit for the multiplier. However, one way to avoid this is to record the sign and then use the absolute value of (x_0 - x_1) and (y_1 - y_0) to perform an unsigned multiplication, after which the result may be negated when both signs originally differed. Another advantage is that even though (x_0 - x_1)(y_1 - y_0) may be negative, the final computation of z_1 only involves additions. Example To compute the product of 12345 and 6789, where B = 10, choose m = 3. We use m right shifts for decomposing the input operands using the resulting base (Bm = 1000), as: : 12345 = 12 · 1000 + 345 : 6789 = 6 · 1000 + 789 Only three multiplications, which operate on smaller integers, are used to compute three partial results: : z2 = 12 × 6 = 72 : z0 = 345 × 789 = 272205 : z1 = (12 + 345) × (6 + 789) − z2 − z0 = 357 × 795 − 72 − 272205 = 283815 − 72 − 272205 = 11538 We get the result by just adding these three partial results, shifted accordingly (and then taking carries into account by decomposing these three inputs in base 1000 like for the input operands): : result = z2 · (Bm)2 \\\\+ z1 · (Bm)1 \\\\+ z0 · (Bm)0, i.e. : result = 72 · 10002 \\\\+ 11538 · 1000 + 272205 = 83810205. Note that the intermediate third multiplication operates on an input domain which is less than two times larger than for the two first multiplications, its output domain is less than four times larger, and base-1000 carries computed from the first two multiplications must be taken into account when computing these two subtractions. Recursive application If n is four or more, the three multiplications in Karatsuba's basic step involve operands with fewer than n digits. Therefore, those products can be computed by recursive calls of the Karatsuba algorithm. The recursion can be applied until the numbers are so small that they can (or must) be computed directly. In a computer with a full 32-bit by 32-bit multiplier, for example, one could choose B = 231 = , and store each digit as a separate 32-bit binary word. Then the sums x1 \\\\+ x0 and y1 \\\\+ y0 will not need an extra binary word for storing the carry-over digit (as in carry-save adder), and the Karatsuba recursion can be applied until the numbers to multiply are only one-digit long. Asymmetric Karatsuba-like formulae Karatsuba's original formula and other generalizations are themselves symmetric. For example, the following formula computes :c(x)=c_4x^4+c_3x^3+c_2x^2+c_1x+c_0=a(x)b(x)=(a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0)(b_2x^2+b_1x+b_0) with 6 multiplications in {\\\\text{GF}}(2)[x], where {\\\\text{GF}}(2) is the Galois field with two elements 0 and 1. :\\\\begin{align} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ { \\\\begin{array}{l} c_0 = p_0, \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_1 = p_{012} + p_{02} + p_{12} + p_2, \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_2 = p_{012} + p_{01} + p_{12}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_3 = p_{012} + p_{01} + p_{02} + p_0, \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_4 = p_2, \\\\end{array} }\\\\right. \\\\end{align} where p_{i}=a_ib_i, \\\\ \\\\ p_{ij}=(a_i+a_j)(b_i+b_j) and p_{ijk}=(a_i+a_j+a_k)(b_i+b_j+b_k). We note that addition and subtraction are the same in fields of characteristic 2. This formula is symmetrical, namely, it does not change if we exchange a and b in p_i, \\\\ \\\\ p_{ij} and p_{ijk}. Based on the second Generalized division algorithms ,Haining Fan, Ming Gu, Jiaguang Sun, Kwok-Yan Lam,\\"Obtaining More Karatsuba-Like Formulae over the Binary Field\\", IET Information security Vol. 6 No. 1 pp. 14-19, 2012. Fan et al. found the following asymmetric formula: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ { \\\\begin{array}{l} c_{0}=p_{0} \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_{1}=p_{012}+p_{2}+m_{4}+m_{5} \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_{2}=p_{012}+m_{3}+m_{5} \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_{3}=p_{012}+p_{0}+m_{3}+m_{4} \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_{4}=p_{2}, \\\\end{array} }\\\\right. \\\\end{align} where m_{3}=(a_{1}+a_{2})(b_{0}+b_{2}), \\\\ \\\\ m_{4}=(a_{0}+a_{1})(b_{1}+b_{2}) and m_{5}=(a_{0}+a_{2})(b_{0}+b_{1}). It is asymmetric because we can obtain the following new formula by exchanging a and b in m_{3}, \\\\ \\\\ m_{4} and m_{5}. :\\\\begin{align} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ { \\\\begin{array}{l} c_{0}=p_{0} \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_{1}=p_{012}+p_{2}+m_{4}+m_{5} \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_{2}=p_{012}+m_{3}+m_{5} \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_{3}=p_{012}+p_{0}+m_{3}+m_{4} \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_{4}=p_{2}, \\\\end{array} }\\\\right. \\\\end{align} where m_{3}=(a_{0}+a_{2})(b_{1}+b_{2}), \\\\ \\\\ m_{4}=(a_{1}+a_{2})(b_{0}+b_{1}) and m_{5}=(a_{0}+a_{1})(b_{0}+b_{2}). Efficiency analysis Karatsuba's basic step works for any base B and any m, but the recursive algorithm is most efficient when m is equal to n/2, rounded up. In particular, if n is 2k, for some integer k, and the recursion stops only when n is 1, then the number of single-digit multiplications is 3k, which is nc where c = log23\\\\. Since one can extend any inputs with zero digits until their length is a power of two, it follows that the number of elementary multiplications, for any n, is at most 3^{ \\\\lceil\\\\log_2 n \\\\rceil} \\\\leq 3 n^{\\\\log_2 3}\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. Since the additions, subtractions, and digit shifts (multiplications by powers of B) in Karatsuba's basic step take time proportional to n, their cost becomes negligible as n increases. More precisely, if t(n) denotes the total number of elementary operations that the algorithm performs when multiplying two n-digit numbers, then :T(n) = 3 T(\\\\lceil n/2\\\\rceil) + cn + d for some constants c and d. For this recurrence relation, the master theorem for divide-and-conquer recurrences gives the asymptotic bound T(n) = \\\\Theta(n^{\\\\log_2 3})\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. It follows that, for sufficiently large n, Karatsuba's algorithm will perform fewer shifts and single-digit additions than longhand multiplication, even though its basic step uses more additions and shifts than the straightforward formula. For small values of n, however, the extra shift and add operations may make it run slower than the longhand method. The point of positive return depends on the computer platform and context. As a rule of thumb, Karatsuba's method is usually faster when the multiplicands are longer than 320–640 bits. Pseudocode Here is the pseudocode for this algorithm, using numbers represented in base ten. For the binary representation of integers, it suffices to replace everywhere 10 by 2. The second argument of the split_at function specifies the number of digits to extract from the right: for example, split_at(\\"12345\\", 3) will extract the 3 final digits, giving: high=\\"12\\", low=\\"345\\". procedure karatsuba(num1, num2) if (num1 < 10) or (num2 < 10) return num1 × num2 /* Calculates the size of the numbers. */ m = min(size_base10(num1), size_base10(num2)) m2 = floor(m / 2) /* m2 = ceil(m / 2) will also work */ /* Split the digit sequences in the middle. */ high1, low1 = split_at(num1, m2) high2, low2 = split_at(num2, m2) /* 3 calls made to numbers approximately half the size. */ z0 = karatsuba(low1, low2) z1 = karatsuba((low1 + high1), (low2 + high2)) z2 = karatsuba(high1, high2) return (z2 × 10 ^ (m2 × 2)) + ((z1 - z2 - z0) × 10 ^ m2) + z0 References External links * Karatsuba's Algorithm for Polynomial Multiplication  Bernstein, D.

History and profile Founded by David Nicholson in 1984, the first undated issue of the magazine was a one-page newsletter Nicholson produced on his PC, photocopied, and sent to several friends. The magazine was published by Sojourner Productions on a quarterly basis. The headquarters was in Washington DC. Three more home-made issues followed, including a 24-page issue that included the magazine's first coverage of the Festival of Pan African Cinema Ouagadougu (FESPACO), an interview with Hollywood star Denzel Washington, and poetry by Amiri Baraka. In 1985, Nicholson entered into a co-publishing agreement with Anthony Gittens, director of the Black Film Institute of the University of the District of Columbia. With funding from the National Endowment for the Arts, the magazine was published in a redesigned format on glossy paper with photographs. Though Nicholson joined the staff of The Washington Post Book World as an editor and book reviewer in 1986, he continued to produce the magazine as editor and publisher for another year before turning over responsibility for it to Jacquie Jones. Under Jones, the publication expanded its coverage of Panafrican film and filmmakers, gaining significant acclaim. It was used as a text at many film schools within the United States and abroad. Contributors included film scholars Donald Bogle, Phyllis Klotman, Pat Aufderheide, Manthia Diawara, and Clyde Taylor. During its last two years of publication, BFR was co-published by Eric Easter, and edited by historian Leasa Farrar Frazer.

Shattuck Jr. (2004, Praeger Publishers), p. 279 was an American physician and clergyman who became the second bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Tennessee and the first Vice- Chancellor of the University of the South. Medical career He was born in Stamford, Connecticut, to a Huguenot-descended family and attended school in New York City, including medical studies at University Medical College, New York University and Bellevue Hospital, graduating in 1847. Quintard moved to Athens, Georgia, in 1848 to take up a medical practice, then moved to Memphis in 1851 to teach physiology and pathological anatomy at Memphis Medical College. Dr. Quintard's 1854 report on Memphis mortality statistics was covered in The New York Times, including his assessment of the city as being \\"the first considerable place to be without the range of yellow fe- ver,\\"\\"Medical\\" New York Times, April 1, 1854. a boast that was to prove incorrect in the 1870s, when Memphis experienced several yellow fever epidemics. Priesthood During this time, Quintard became friends with James Hervey Otey, the first bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Tennessee, resulting in his decision to give up the medical profession for the priesthood. A gentleman of great talents, Quintard studied for holy orders in 1854, was ordained deacon on January 1, 1855 and priest on January 6, 1856. He subsequently served as the rector of Calvary Church in Memphis and at the Church of the Advent in Nashville. An adherent of the Oxford Movement (1833-1845), Quintard described himself as a \\"high churchman\\" and a \\"ritualist\\", identifying with Anglicans who were reviving ritual practices associated, in the popular mind, with Roman Catholicism. The History of the Church in the Diocese of Tennessee. Arthur Howard Noll (1900, James Pott & Co.) In fact, the Oxford Movement leaders attempted to call the Anglican Church to her first principles and roots in history and tradition. To what degree Quintard was actually a Ritualist is a matter to debate. None of the Tractarians was a \\"ritualist,\\" and the ritualism that developed in the Episcopal Church in the South was rather tame during Bishop Quintard's lifetime. Like Bishop Otey, he was of the Southern branch of the old High Church or Hobartian group of Episcopalians. The leaders of the Oxford Movement, also called \\"Tractarians\\" for the ninety Tracts for the Times they published, rediscovered the Church of the Creed as more than an institution or an arm of civil power. Quintard and his generation were deeply moved by the writings of faithful and brilliant Christian intellectuals such as John Keble (d. 1866), Edward Pusey (d. 1882), and John Henry Newman (d. 1890), who guided many Anglicans into a deeper appreciation of the Church as a God-made phenomenon and indeed the Body mystical of Christ in this world. Quintard's religion was as \\"Catholic and Reformed\\" most solid Anglicans, and he assumed in a manner which did not transcend his culture that the Church of England and her offspring were in fact the historic Catholic Church for English-speaking peoples. Civil War After the outbreak of the American Civil War, Quintard joined the Rock City Guards, a Nashville militia, as chaplain. He was subsequently nominated by soldiers in the Confederate 1st Tennessee Infantry Regiment, to serve as their chaplain. He accepted this invitation, despite his initial pro-Union stance, and also served as a regimental surgeon.Doctor Quintard, Chaplain and Second Bishop of Tennessee: Being His Story of the War, 1861-1865 (1905) by Charles Todd Quintard, edited by Arthur Howard Noll, The University Press of Sewanee, Tennessee. Informally he was known as the Chaplain of the Confederacy. He was the compiler of the Confederate Soldiers' Pocket Manual of Devotions (Charleston, 1863).Reproduced at https://archive.org/stream/07794796.3866.emory.edu/07794796_3866#page/n3/mode/2up , retrieved September 6, 2017.

The bishops and lay leaders of the national Episcopal Church confirmed his election the next month at the General Convention in Philadelphia. The subsequent consecration of the South's first post-war bishop was viewed as a sign of healing within the church, as evidenced by this comment in the October 13, 1865 New York Times: :The entire service was one to be long remembered by all who witnessed it, and the occasion was one fraught with interest and importance in the history of the Church, as it marked the first step toward that reunion in the Church consequent upon the rapid march of events and the peace which now happily blesses our whole land. It is to be hoped that the occasion will strengthen that harmony which prevails in the convention, and be productive of beneficial results.https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00E14F8385C1B7B93C1A8178BD95F418684F9 retrieved 10 April 2011.

He also led efforts to ensure the post-war survival of the fledgling University of the South at Sewanee, Tennessee. As the school's vice-chancellor (the institution's chief executive position, despite the name) Quintard sponsored the establishment of a training school for clergy there in 1866 and laid the cornerstone for St. Augustine's Chapel in 1867. He traveled to northern U.S. dioceses to raise funds for the university and went to England three times with the same purpose, returning with large sums of money and many books for the school's library.Encyclopedia of religion in the South (2005), Charles Reagan Wilson. Mercer University Press. Quintard Hall at the university was given by his brother George W. Quintard in 1900. Until 1908 it was the site of the grammar school, and from then until 1971 it was used by the Sewanee Military Academy.

Davis [1958], published by the Chapter of St. Mary's Cathedral (Gailor Memorial), Memphis, Tennessee. Quintard believed that his mission was to make the Episcopal Church in Tennessee “a refuge for all—the lame, halt and blind as well as the rich.” He opposed parish pew rents and fostered a ministry on behalf of the disadvantaged. Concerned by the effects of industrialization on workers, he established a refuge for the poor in Memphis in 1869, and in 1873 he advocated a plan to assist people lacking food, housing, and education. Quintard started missions for the laborers at foundries in South Pittsburg (1876) and in Chattanooga (1880). Hoping that the Episcopal Church would also expand its evangelistic work among African Americans, he opposed plans to segregate the black congregations of the denomination, and he assisted in the founding of Hoffman Hall, a seminary for African Americans adjacent to Fisk University in Nashville.The Episcopalians, David Hein and Gardiner H. Shattuck Jr. (2004, Praeger Publishers), p. 280 Although Bishop Quintard traveled five times to England, helping to mend relations with the Church of England, he also became involved in the Gallican movement in France. This started with an 1875 trip, a gift of his friend Sam Noble, to enroll his son George at a private school in Paris as well as to lead Sam's children Ned and Addie around England, France, Switzerland and Germany. He met Rev.

It is unique in having almost no patronage from a ruling dynasty, other than its composers. Gujarat Vidhya Sabha, Gujarat Sahitya Sabha, Gujarat Sahitya Akademi and Gujarati Sahitya Parishad are Gujarat-based literary institutions promoting the Gujarati literature. History Such factors as the policies of the rulers, the living style of the people, and the worldwide influence on society are important for any literature to flourish. In Gujarat, due to the development of trade and commerce, the religious influence of Jainism as well as Hinduism, and also due to the safety and encouragement of rulers like Chaulukya (Solanki) and Vaghela Rajputs, literary activities were in full force from the 11th century. * Gujarati literature ** Early literature (up to 1450 AD) *** Prāg-Narsinh Yug (1000 AD to 1450 AD) **** Rāsa Yug ** Medieval literature (1450 AD – 1850 AD) *** Narsinh Yug (1450 AD to 1850 AD) **** Bhakti Yug ***** Saguṇ Bhakti Yug ***** Nirguṇ Bhakti Yug ** Modern literature (1850 AD to date) *** Sudhārak Yug or Narmad Yug (1850–1885 AD) *** Paṇḍit Yug or Govardhan Yug (1885–1915 AD) *** Gandhi Yug (1915–1945 AD) *** Anu-Ghandhi Yug (1940–1955 AD) *** Ādhunik Yug (1955–1985 AD) *** Anu-Ādhunik Yug (1985 – to date) Literature in Gujarati is sometimes also classified into two broad categories, namely poetry and prose, the former savouring and basking in its long lineage, dating back to the 6th century. Poetry as a perception was a medium for expressing religious beliefs and judgements, a stronghold of medieval Indian times. In this context of gradual evolution, the history of Gujarati literature is generally classed into three broad periods, consisting of the Early period (up to c. 1450 AD), the Middle period (1450 to 1850 AD) and the Modern period (1850 AD. onwards). However, Gujarati literature and its tremendous maturation and proficiency in contributing to culture is retraced back to Gujarat Sultanate days (referring to the Muzaffarid dynasty, which had provided the sultans of Gujarat in western India from 1391 to 1583). Gujarati literature is divided mainly into three eras or Yugas; the early, medieval and modern, with these eras being further subdivided. The early era (up to 1450 AD) and medieval era (1450 AD – 1850 AD) are divided into 'before Narsinh' and 'after Narsinh' periods sometimes. Some scholars divide this period as 'Rāsa yug', 'Saguṇ Bhakti yug' and 'Nirguṇ Bhakti yug' also. The modern era (1850 AD to date) is divided into 'Sudhārak Yug' or 'Narmad Yug', 'Paṇḍit Yug' or 'Govardhan Yug', 'Gandhi Yug', 'Anu-Gandhi Yug', 'Ādhunik Yug' and 'Anu- Ādhunik Yug'. Early literature =Pre-Narsinh Era (1000 AD to 1450 AD)= Instruction by Monks, Folio from the manuscript of Siddhahaimashabdanushasana by Hemachandra (1089–1172) The Jain monk and scholar Hemacandrācārya Suri was one of the earliest scholars of Prakrit and Apabhramsha grammars. He had penned a formal set of 'grammarian principles' as the harbinger of the Gujarati language during the reign of the Chaulukya king Jayasimha Siddharaja of Anhilwara. This treatise formed the cornerstone of Apabhramsa grammar in the Gujarati language, establishing a language from a combination of corrupted forms of languages like Sanskrit and Ardhamagadhi. He authored Kavyanushasana (Poetics), a handbook or manual of poetry, Siddha- haima-shabdanushasana on Prakrit and Apabhramsha grammars, and Desinamamala, a list of words of local origin. It is generally accepted by historians and researchers in literary genres in Gujarati literature that the earliest writings in this very ancient language were by Jaina authors. These were composed in the form of Rāsas, Phāgus and Vilāsas. Rāsas were long poems which were essentially heroic, romantic or narrative in nature. Śālībhadra Sūri's Bharateśvara Bāhubalī rāsa (1185 AD), Vijayasena's Revantagiri-rāsa (1235 AD), Ambadeva's Samararasa (1315 AD) and Vinayaprabha's Gautama Svāmi rāsa (1356 AD) are the most illustrious examples of this form of literature in Gujarati. The chief subjects of Rasas were descriptions of nature, erotic depictions of seasons, Jain Acharyas and Tirthankaras, biographies of historic characters. The collections of these Rasas are currently preserved in Jain libraries of Patan, Ahmedabad, Jaisalmer and Khambhat. The phāgus are poems that pictured the blissful and cheery nature of the spring festival (Vasanta). They were written by Jain monks but are not centred on religion. Rājasekhara's Neminatha-phagu (1344 AD) and unknown poet's Vasanta-vilāsa (1350 AD) are instances of such texts. Vasantavilasa had 84 stanzas and is similar to a phagu of the same name so it is possible that both are written by the same person. Other notable prabandha or narrative poems of this period include Śrīdhara's Raṇamalla Chhanda (1398 AD), Merutunga's Prabandhachintamani, Padmanābha's Kānhaḍade Prabandha (1456 AD) and Bhīma's Sadayavatsa Kathā (1410 AD). Neminātha Chatuṣpadika (1140 AD) by Vinayacandra is the oldest of the bāramāsi genre of Gujarati poems. Among non-Jain writers of the time, Asait Thakar is considered as a major contributor who wrote around 360 vesha (lit. dress) of Bhavai. He is credited with bringing theatre to the Gujarati literature. Abdur Raheman, who wrote Sandeshkarash, is considered as the first Muslim writer of Gujarati literature. There are some prose works in grammar, bhashya and religion. The earliest work in Gujarati prose was Taruṇaprabha's Balavabodha (1355 AD) which is religious work. Prithvichandra Charita (1422 AD) of Manikyasundara, which essentially served as a religious romance, is the most paramount illustration of old Gujarati prose and is reminiscent of Bāṇabhaṭṭa's Kadambari. Somasundara (1374) and Mugdhavbodha Auktika are other notable prose works. Due to flourishing trade and commerce in Ahmedabad and Khambat (Cambay), entertainment activities started to develop, and the Jain saints, story-tellers, puppet shows, and Bhavai (dramas) also revived literature. Medieval literature During this period, the poetry dominated the literary activities. As Rasas written by Jain monks were a type of narrative poetry, Akhyanas are considered as their literary descendants which reached their glory in this period. Garbo and Garbi poetry associated with dance were developed as well as phagu and Barmasi genres depicting seasons. The types of pada: prabhatiya, dhol, kafi and chabkha were created. So the singable poetry, a tradition inherited from Apabhramsa, developed and dominated in the period. =Narsinh Era (1450 AD – 1850 AD)= During the 15th century, Gujarati literature had come under the tremendous sway of the Bhakti movement, a popular cultural movement to liberate religion from entrenched priesthood. Narsinh Mehta (15th century) was the foremost poet of this era. His poems delineated a very saintly and mystical sense and bore an intense reflection of the philosophy of Advaita. Narsinh Mehta's Govind Gaman, Surat Sangram, Sudama Charitra and Sringaramala are illustrations of this devotional poetry. Due to his poetic style, the works of contemporary and early poets were obscured. Bhakti Era (15th–19th century) During this age, Jain and Hindu poets produced Gujarat literature in abundance. The prose and poetry created were aimed to encourage religion and worship. Hindu texts such as Gita, Mahabharata, Vedas, and Bhagwata became popular. There were also creations of prayers, Jain history, etc. During this period of the influence of the Bhakti Movement on Gujarati literature, the Ramayana, the Bhagavad Gita, the Yogavashistha and the Panchatantra were all translated into Gujarati. This period also experienced the colossal Puranic revival, which led to the rapid growth and maturation of devotional poetry in Gujarati literature. This era is divided into two traditions, Sagun Bhakti tradition and Nirgun Bhakti tradition. ;Sagun Bhakti tradition In this tradition, the God is worshiped in physical form, having some form and virtues like Rama and Krishna. Narsinh Mehta, Meera, and Dayaram were foremost contributors of this tradition. Bhalan (1434–1514 AD) had furnished a meritorious representation of Bāṇabhaṭṭa's Kadambari into Gujarati. Bhalana composed other fourteen or fifteen works such as Dasham Skandha, Nalakhyan, Ramabal Charitra and Chandi Akhyana. Bhalan is known for his akhyana-style and is considered a person who introduced it to Gujarati literature. Meera supplied many Pada (Verse). Premanand Bhatt was a prolific poet and there is much folklore about him. He is credited with writing 47 works but scholars accredit only 27 works to him. He chiefly authored works on Narsinh Mehta, Bhagvat and Mahabharata. His notable works are Okha Harana, Nalakhyan, Abhimanyu Akhyana, Dasham Skandha and Sudama Charitra. Shamal Bhatt was an extremely creative and productive poet who gave birth to unforgettable works like Padmavati, Batris Putli, Nanda Batrisi, Sinhasan Batrisi and Madana Mohan in Gujarati verse writing. His works also depict strong female characters compared to contemporary works for the first time in Gujarati literature. Dayaram (1767–1852) had given rise to religious, ethical and romantic lyrics referred to as Garbi. His most authoritative works comprise Bhakti Poshan, Rasik Vallabh and Ajamel Akhyan. His death is considered as the end of medieval period of Gujarati literature. The \\"Ramayana\\" was authored by Giridhara in Gujarati during the middle of the 19th century. Parmanand, Brahmanand, Vallabha, Haridas, Ranchhod and Divali Bai were other authoritative 'saint poets' from this period of poetry predomination in Gujarati literature. ;Nirgun Bhakti tradition The God has no physical form in this tradition. Narsinh Mehta and Akho were the foremost contributors of this tradition. His works depict contemporary society, philosophy, behaviour and humour. Akho's Akhe Gita, Chittavichar Samvad and Anubhav Bindu have always been illustrated as being emphatic compositions on the Vedanta. Yet another poet, Mandana, had authored works like Prabodha Battrisi, Ramayan and Rupmangal Katha. Other contributors are Kabir-Panthi poets, Dhira Bhagat, Bhoja Bhagat, Bapusaheb Gaikwad, and Pritam. Others Poets from the Swaminarayan sect such as Sahajanand Swami, Brahmanand Swami, Premanand Swami and Nishkulanand Swami also contributed immensely. Their works were focused on morality, devotion and reclusion. Parsi poets also entered Gujarati literature during this period. Their notable works are translation of Parsi religious literature in Gujarati. Eravad Rustom Peshot is considered as the first Parsi Gujarati poet who wrote biographies such as Zarthost-nameh, Siyavaksha-nameh, Viraf-nameh and Aspandiar-nameh. Modern literature (1850 AD – present) With the colonial British Government and the new technology of printing and press, education in the English language began. The new age brought many newspapers and magazines, which spread awareness in society. Because of this, there was much more literature, and it included forms other than the ancient religious style of poetry. The creations reflect social welfare, criticism, plays, new-age thinking, worship of the country, the values of life, etc. This period is subdivided into following eras: Reformist Era or Narmad Era, Scholar Era or Govardhan Era, Gandhi Era, Post-Gandhi Era, Modern Era and Postmodern Era. = Reformist Era or Narmad Era (1850–1885 AD) = From the middle of 19th century, Gujarati, like other regional Indian languages, came under strong western influence, precisely due to colonial residence and colonial reign. Western education and culture started to influence local culture and the awareness was spread about pervasive customs of Hindu society. Two sections in society emerged: conservative following traditional customs as a cultural duty and liberal which believed in opposition and end of social pervasive customs and injustice So Prarthana Samaj, Arya Samaj, Theosophical Society were established which wanted to reform society through religion while other reformers believed in non-religious way of reform. Social reform was a central subjects in works of this era. Narmad, Govardhanram Tripathi and Gatubhai Gopilal Dhruv advocated reform through religion while Ramanbhai Nilkanth, Narsinhrao Divetia and Kant advocated non-religious way. Dalpatram (1820–1898) and Narmad (1833–1886) are the trailblazers of modern Gujarati literature. Dalpatram's Venacharitra portrays his command over hilarity and wittiness. He contributed in prose and poetry. His prose works include plays, essays and other works such as Laxminatak, Mithyabhiman, Streesambhashan, Tarkikbodh, Daivagnadarpan and Bhootnibandh. His poetry include Farbasvilas, Farbasvirah, Dalpatpingal and Hope Vachanmala. Modern studies of Gujarat and its language began with the British administrator Alexander Kinlock Forbes shortly after the British occupation of the region. Alexander Forbes carried out an extensive investigation of Gujarati culture and literature over the previous thousand years and amassed a large collection of manuscripts. An organisation named after him, called the Farbas Gujarati Sabha, dedicates itself to the preservation and promotion of Gujarati literature and language and history from its headquarters in Mumbai. The first Gujarati dictionary, known as Narmakosh, was composed and compiled by Narmad; it is essentially a history of the world, and also an authority on poetics. He moved away from the subjects of medieval literature and wrote on freedom, nationalism, nature and romance. He attempted many varieties of poetry and smoothly adapted English verses into Gujarati. He wrote the first autobiography Mari Hakikat of Gujarati literature. He also wrote essays and plays. His Rukmini Haran and Virasinh are considered by scholars to be masterpiece compendia of poems. Navalram Pandya pioneered criticism in Gujarati. The other notable works in Gujarati literature in this era are Bholanath Sarabhai's Ishvara Prarthanamala (1872), Navalram Pandya's Bhatt nu Bhopalu (1867) and Veermati (1869), and Nandshankar Mehta's Karan Ghelo (1866), which was the first original novel of Gujarati literature. Ranchhodlal Udayaram Dave (1837–1923) is respected as the groundbreaker and trailblazer in the art of play-writing in Gujarati with his Lalita Dukh Darsak play. Other significant dramatists were Dalpatram, Narmad and Navalram. Parsi writers of the era include Behramji Malabari who first authored original works in standardised Gujarati. Parsi authors wrote large number of works in Parsi Gujarati and standard Gujarati dialects as well as translated novels from English and French literature. They are credited with establishment of Gujarati theatre. =Scholar Era or Govardhan Era (1885–1915 AD)= Govardhanram Tripathi Pandit means 'a scholar' in Gujarati. During this era, the scholarly writing developed gradually, hence it is known as the Pandit era. The era is considered by Dhirubhai Thaker as a golden era of Gujarati literature when poetry, play, essays and biography reached its zenith. The writers of this era were authoring under the influence of westernisation and social reforms. In politics, it was a period of rise of Indian independence movement, established western education system and western study of ancient religious literature and cultural renaissance. The foreign literature had started influencing local literature in India and people were exposed to the outer influence. The writers of this era also had a reformative bent of mind, but they paid more attention towards literary accomplishments. Their fundamental belief was that the literature is not an art that anybody can attempt to write whatever comes to mind, but it is a creative art which demands seriousness and responsibility. Notable writers of this era include Govardhanram Tripathi, Manilal Dwivedi, Ramanbhai Neelkanth, Narsinhrao Divetia, Mansukhram Tripathi, Keshavlal Dhruv, Manishankar Ratnaji Bhatt 'Kant', Kalapi, Balwantray Thakore, Nhanalal, Anandshankar Dhruv etc. Govardhanram Tripathi was the major novelists of era whose celebrated classic novel is Saraswatichandra. The work of others includes Narsinhrao Divetia's \\"Smarana Samhita\\", \\"Kusumamala\\", \\"Hridayavina\\", \\"Nupur Jhankar\\" and \\"Buddha Charit\\"; Manishankar Ratanji Bhatt or Kavi Kant's \\"Purvalap\\" ('Devayani', 'Atijnana', 'Vasanta Vijay' and 'Chakravak Mithuna') and Balwantray Thakore's \\"Bhanakar\\". Nhanalal was another important poet of this period in Gujarati literature, who had outshone incredibly in his \\"Apadya Gadya\\" or rhyming prose. Nhanalal's recognition and reputation is based on two poetic compilations, namely \\"Vasantotsava\\" (1898) and \\"Chitradarshan\\" (1921), an epic referred to as \\"Kuruksetra\\", and numerous plays like \\"Indukumar\\", \\"Jayajayant\\", \\"Vishva Gita\\", \\"Sanghamitra\\" and \\"Jagat Prerana\\". =Gandhi Era (1915–1945 AD)= Mahatma Gandhi The Pandit Era came to an end in 1914, when the First World War broke out. Mahatma Gandhi, with his weapon of Satyagraha (Friendly passive resistance) tried and tested in South Africa. Mahatma Gandhi left Africa and arrived in early January 1915. With penetrating insight he observed first hand the socio-economic and political conditions obtaining in India and thought about every question related to life. After Gandhi's arrival on the Indian scene, the literary climate of Gujarat, which was the hub of all Gandhi's socio-political activities, underwent a rapid change. Gandhi started editing Navajivan, a weekly periodical, and spread his thoughts and ideology. During this period, Mahatma Gandhi and Gujarat Vidyapith became the nerve- centre of all literary activities, where new values emerged and more emphasis was given to Gandhian values, Indianisation and simplification. Novels, short stories, diaries, letters, plays, essays, criticisms, biographies, travel books and all kinds of prose began to flood Gujarati literature. Gandhi, Ramnarayan V. Pathak, K. M. Munshi, Swami Anand, Umashankar Joshi, Sundaram, Jhaverchand Meghani, Pannalal Patel, Jyotindra Dave, Chandravadan Mehta, Zinabhai Desai (\\"Snehrashmi\\"), Vaid Mohanlal Chunilal Dhami, Manubhai Pancholi (\\"Darshak\\"), and Ishwar Petlikar are the main contributors of this age. Modern Gujarati prose was ushered in with a bang by Narmad, but K.M. Munshi and, of course, the legend and nationalist himself, Mahatma Gandhi, gave it prominence in this age. Gandhi's autobiography, An Autobiography of My Experiments with Truth ((Gujarātī \\"સત્યના પ્રયોગો અથવા આત્મકથા\\")), Satyagraha in South Africa about his struggle there, Hind Swaraj or Indian Home Rule, a political pamphlet, and a paraphrase in Gujarati of John Ruskin's Unto The Last are his most well-known works. This last essay sets out his programme on economics. He wrote extensively on vegetarianism, diet and health, religion, social reforms, etc. Gandhi usually wrote in Gujarati, though he also revised the Hindi and English translations of his books. Gandhi was a prolific writer. For decades he edited several newspapers including Harijan in Gujarati, Hindi and English; Indian Opinion while in South Africa and, Young India, in English, and \\"Navajivan\\", a Gujarati monthly, on his return to India. Later, \\"Navajivan\\" was published in Hindi.Peerless Communicator by V.N. Narayanan. Life Positive Plus, October–December 2002 He wrote letters almost every day to individuals and newspapers. During the 1940s, there could be witnessed a rise in communistic poetry and this inspired a movement for progressive literature in Gujarati too. Meghani, Bhogilal Gandhi, Swapnastha and others began to preach class conflict and hatred of religion through their writings. K.M. Munshi is deemed one of the most multi-talented and flexible and looming literary figures of Gujarati literature of contemporary times. K.M. Munshi's voluminous works include dramas, essays, short stories and novels. His famous novels are included in the list of \\"Patan ni Prabhuta\\", \\"Gujarat no Nath\\", \\"Jay Somnath\\" (1940), \\"Prithvi Vallabh\\", \\"Bhagavan Parshuram\\" (1946) and \\"Tapasvini\\" (1957). Indeed, after the rise of Mahatma Gandhi's prominence in a steadily strengthening struggle for independence and social equality, a great volume of poetry, written by poets like Umashankar, Sundaram, Shesh, Snehrashmi and Betai, amongst others, centred on the existing social order, the struggle for independence and the travails of Mahatma Gandhi himself. Highly inspired by Rabindranath Tagore's dialogue poems, Umashankar Joshi enriched the existing Gujrati literature by penning in the same manner. Two such poems are his \\"Prachina\\" and \\"Mahaprasthan\\". For his poem \\"Nishith\\", he received the Jnanpith Award in 1967. Pannalal Patel received the Jnanpith Award in 1985 for his novel \\"Maanavi Ni Bhavaai\\". The Gujarati novel was also made a household name by G.G. Joshi ('Dhumketu'), Chunilal V. Shah, Gunvantrai Acharya, Jhaverchand Meghani, Pannalal Patel and Manubhai Pancholi. Significant dramatists of this age are Chandravadan Mehta, Umashankar Joshi, Jayanti Dalal and Chunilal Madia. Amongst the important essayists, citation can be made of Kaka Kalelkar, Ratilal Trivedi, Lilavati Munshi, Jyotindra Dave, Ramnarayan Pathak. =Post-Gandhi Era (1940–1955 AD)= In this era there is a dominance of poetry. The main contributors of this age are Niranjan Bhagat, Rajendra Shah, Venibhai Purohit, Prahlad Parekh and Balmukund Dave. Rajendra Shah won the Jnanpith—the Indian government's most prestigious literary prize—for the year 2001. The judges noted, \\"his intensity of emotion and innovation in form and expression which set him apart as a poet of great significance. The mystical tone of his poetry stems from the tradition of great medieval masters like Kabir, Narsinh Mehta and literary giants like them\\". He authored more than 20 collections of poems and songs, mainly on the themes of the beauty of nature, and about the everyday lives of indigenous peoples and fisherfolk communities. In his poems using Sanskrit metrics, he was influenced by Rabindranath Tagore. He was one of the giants of the post Gandhi-era, called 'Anu-Gandhi Yug' in Gujarati literature. =Modern Era (1955–1985 AD)= Suresh Joshi Post-independence Gujarati poetry displays a higher form of subjectivity and explores newer philosophies and lines of thought and imagery. The poems became more subjective and brutal, discarding old imageries and symbols and replacing them with new ideas. Prominent Gujarati poets of the post-independence era include critically acclaimed poets like Suresh Joshi, Gulam Mohamed Sheikh, Harindra Dave, Manoj Khanderia, Chinu Modi, Nalin Raval and Adil Mansuri, among others. Post-independence prose literature in Gujarati had two distinct trends, traditional and modern. The former dealt more with ethical values and its main writers were Gulabdas Broker, Mansukhlal Jhaveri, Vishnuprasad Trivedi and others. Existentialism, surrealism and symbolism influenced the latter. The modernists also wanted to do away with moral values and religious beliefs. Eminent writers of this trend comprise Niranjan Bhagat, Chandrakant Bakshi, Suresh Joshi, Madhu Rye, Raghuveer Chaudhari, Dhiruben Patel, Saroj Pathak, and others. There was also a noticeable segment of Popular writers like Vithal Pandya, Sarang Barot, Dinkar Joshi, Harkisan Mehta and Ashwinee Bhatt whose novels found a place in the hearts of common people. Their novels reached every corner of Gujarat and also to vast Gujarati readers outside Gujarat through newspapers and magazines. Gujarati prose has recorded growth and literary feats quite rapidly in less than two hundred years and now can be counted among the front benchers in Indian literature. =Postmodern Era (1985 – present)= Bhagwatikumar Sharma, Vinesh Antani, Dhruv Bhatt, Yogesh Joshi, Bindu Bhatt, Kanji Patel brought freshness in narration in novels. Same can be said for Bholabhai Patel, Manilal H. Patel, Anil Joshi for essays. Some new poets have also given significant literary work including Sanju Vala, Rajesh Vyas 'Miskin', Ankit Trivedi, Rajesh Vankar, Anil Chavda, Bhavesh Bhatt, Ashok Chavda, Kiransinh Chauhan, Neerav Patel and many others. In this age, the other outstanding themes are Dalit literature and 'feminist literature'. Modern poetry continued to take its roots deep.

Among Tipton's works are the themes for the TV shows Soap and its spinoff Benson, It's a Living, I'm a Big Girl Now, and Empty Nest, plus incidental music for numerous shows, including The Courtship of Eddie's Father, Soap, Mulligan's Stew, The Love Boat, Heartland, The Golden Girls, and The Golden Palace. He also wrote the score for the film Badlands (1973), and for the television movies Home for the Holidays (1972), The Affair (1973), The Stranger Who Looks Like Me (1974), The Gun and the Pulpit (1974), Hit Lady (1974), Red Alert (1977), The Gift (1979), and Gidget's Summer Reunion (1985). His arranging and conducting credits include numerous hits by Jan and Dean, The Sunshine Company, and Jose Feliciano's hit version of \\"Light My Fire\\" by The Doors. He was one of the main arrangers on the albums of Leonard Nimoy during the late 1960s. Tipton is arguably best known in the pop- rock field for his work as an arranger on singles and albums recorded by singer-songwriter Harry Nilsson during the most productive phase of his career in the 1960s and early 1970s. They met ca. 1964 through music publisher Perry Botkin, Jr., where Tipton worked as a copyist and their collaboration began when Tipton put up his life's savings ($2,500) to arrange and record four Nilsson tracks which they sold to Tower, a sub-label of Capitol Records; these tracks were subsequently included on the Spotlight on Nilsson LP.Harry Nilsson biography Tipton went on to arrange Nilsson's acclaimed early albums for RCA Records (1967–71), as well as his classic single \\"Everybody's Talkin'\\" (which won a Grammy Award), the Skidoo soundtrack, and Nilsson's music for the TV series The Courtship of Eddie's Father and the animated feature The Point!. In 1970, Tipton recorded a (now rare) LP of instrumental interpretations of Nilsson's music, Nilsson by Tipton (Warner Bros. Records, 1970), which featured cover illustrations by Dean Torrence. However, Tipton and Nilsson had an unexplained falling-out, and Tipton reportedly refused to be involved in the 2010 documentary on Nilsson's life and career. Tipton died in 2016 at age 84.

Although a report by the U.S. State Department, based on conditions in 2010, summed up the human rights situation in the country by asserting that the government “generally respected the human rights of its citizens,” the details in the report itself strongly indicate otherwise, and several international human-rights groups have described the state of human rights in Oman in highly critical terms. According to a report,Oman: Human Rights Update on 20 December 2015, poet and television producer Nasser al-Badri was summoned by the Police Special Section and detained for 12 days without charge and without trial. The report added that the Omani Observatory for Human Rights said that al-Badri was detained because of tweets he posted criticising Sultan Qaboos and the state of the country’s economy. Article 41 of Oman’s statute (constitution) criminalizes any criticism of the sultan, stating that the sultan’s ‘person is inviolable and must be respected and his orders must be obeyed’. For example, Freedom House has routinely rated the country “Not Free” and an official of Human Rights Watch, in a December 2012 overview of Oman and “five other smaller Gulf states,” stated: “Human rights conditions...are quite poor overall....There is little respect for core civil and political rights such as freedom of expression, assembly and association. Peaceful dissent typically faces harsh repression. The administration of justice is highly personalised, with limited due process protections, especially in political and security-related cases.” A 2012 report by Bertelsmann Stiftung declared that while “Oman’s legal code theoretically protects civil liberties and personal freedoms, both are regularly ignored by the regime. Oman, therefore, cannot be considered free.” On the other right hand, Middle East Concern, in a 2011 report, claimed that Oman's recent human-rights record had been generally good, citing adherence to proper arrest and judicial procedures and acceptable prison conditions, even as it acknowledged the limits on freedom of expression and assembly, academic freedom, and other restrictions. In reaction to growing public demonstrations by protesters demanding greater freedom and human rights, Oman's already severe constraints on freedom of speech, assembly, and association have been tightened even further since early 2011. Historical background Oman, whose population as of 2018 of 4.8 million includes about two million non-citizens, has been an independent sultanate since 1650 and has been governed by the Al Bu Sa'id family since the 18th century. Qaboos bin Said al Said, who attained power by overthrowing his father, ruled from 1970 to 2020 and “followed a path of careful and gradual development and modernization,” eliminating many of the “harsh restrictions on various personal freedoms” that were enforced under his father's regime and granting amnesty to many of its opponents. In 1996, “Sultan Qaboos issued a royal decree promulgating the basic law, which is considered to be Oman’s constitution.” It guaranteed citizens' basic civil rights and “established a bicameral legislature, the Council of Oman, consisting of an upper chamber, the State Council (Majlis al-Dawla), the 75 members of which are appointed by the sultan and have only advisory powers, and a lower chamber, the Consultative Council (Majlis al-Shura),” which is elected by the people. Both chambers, however, are ultimately advisory in nature, with sole legislative, executive, and judicial power still resting entirely in the hands of the sultan. Freedom from torture The practice of torture is widespread in Oman state penal institutions and has become the state's typical reaction to independent political expression. Torture methods in use in Oman include mock execution, beating, hooding, solitary confinement, subjection to extremes of temperature and to constant noise, abuse and humiliation. There have been numerous reports of torture and other inhumane forms of punishment perpetrated by Omani security forces on protesters and detainees. Several prisoners detained in 2012 complained of sleep deprivation, extreme temperatures, and solitary confinement. Omani authorities kept Sultan al-Saadi in solitary confinement, denied him access to his lawyer and family, forced him to wear a black bag over his head whenever he left his cell, including when using the restroom, and told him his family had “forsaken” him and asked for him to be imprisoned. Abductions and arbitrary arrests In August 2014, The Omani writer and human rights defender Mohammed Alfazari, the founder and editor-in-chief of the e-magazine Mowatin “Citizen”, disappeared after going to the police station in the Al-Qurum district of Muscat. His whereabouts and condition remain unknown. The Omani government denies his detention and refuses to disclose information about his whereabouts. On 17 July 2015 Al Fazari left Oman seeking for a political asylum in UK after a travel ban was issued against him without providing any reasons and his official documents including his national ID and passport were confiscated more than 8 months. There were more reports of politically motivated disappearances in the country. books are banned in Oman. He is also the founder and EIC of Muwatin. In 2012, armed security forces arrested Sultan al-Saadi, a social media activist. According to reports, authorities detained him at an unknown location for one month for comments he posted online critical of the government. Authorities previously arrested al-Saadi in 2011 for participating in protests and again in 2012 for posting comments online deemed insulting to Sultan Qaboos. In May 2012 security forces detained Ismael al-Meqbali, Habiba al-Hinai, and Yaqoub al-Kharusi, human rights activists who were visiting striking oil workers. Authorities released al-Hinai and al- Kharusi shortly after their detention but did not inform al-Meqbali’s friends and family of his whereabouts for weeks. Authorities pardoned al-Meqbali in March. In December 2013, a Yemeni national disappeared in Oman after he was arrested at a checkpoint in Dhofar Governorate. Omani authorities refuse to acknowledge his detention. His whereabouts and condition remain unknown. In January 2014, Omani intelligence agents arrested a Bahraini actor and handed him over to the Bahraini authorities on the same day of his arrest. The actor has been subjected to a forced disappearance, his whereabouts and condition remain unknown. According to Amnesty International annual report 2016, The authorities continued restricting freedom of expression. Many journalists and activists were arrested under penal code provisions which criminalize insulting the Sultan. In March 2015, Talib al-Saeedi, online activist, was arrested for three weeks without charge. Days after, a court sentenced Saeed al-Daroodi, blogger, to one year in prison and a fine; convicting him of “trying to overthrow the government” and “spreading hate”. National Human Rights Commission of Oman The National Human Rights Commission, established in 2008, is not independent from the regime. It is chaired by the former deputy inspector general of Police and Customs and its members are appointed by royal decree. In June 2012, one of its members requested that she be relieved of her duties because she disagreed with a statement made by the Commission justifying the arrest of intellectuals and bloggers and the restriction of freedom of expression in the name of respect for “the principles of religion and customs of the country”. Democratic rights The Omani government is a monarchy. The sultan is the leader of the country and serves as the country's chief of state and head of government. The monarchy is hereditary and the monarch's cabinet is appointed by him. Citizens of Oman can vote for members of the Parliament. The members are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms. The Consultative Assembly of Oman enjoys legislative and audit powers. The country has universal suffrage for people 21 years of age and older; however, members of the military and security forces are not allowed to vote. Basic rights The Basic Law forbids discrimination founded on “gender, origin, color, language, religion, sect, domicile, or social status.” Oman's government does not commit arbitrary killings, engineer “disappearances,” or engage in torture or other cruel punishments. Laws against corruption are effectively enforced. The public has no access to official information. Since 2006, citizens of Gulf Cooperation Council countries are permitted to own property in Oman; non-GCC citizens can only own tourist properties. Although Islam is Oman's state religion, the Basic Law guarantees the “freedom to practice religious rites in accordance with recognized customs...provided that it does not disrupt public order or conflict with accepted standards of behavior.” Freedom House declared in 2005 that “Oman is, overall, a religiously tolerant society,” noting that while non-Muslims “are able to practice their religious rites freely, they are required to register with the government and may not proselytize or publish religious materials.” The U.S. State Department's International Religious Freedom Report for 2011 notes that non-Muslim communities in Oman “are allowed to practice their beliefs without interference only on land specifically donated by the sultan for the purpose of collective worship.” While “gatherings of a religious nature are not allowed in private homes or in any location other than government-approved houses of worship,” Oman's government “has not actively enforced the prohibition.” Freedom of movement within Oman and repatriation are permitted, but it can be difficult to obtain permission to travel abroad or emigrate. Only since 2010 have married women been able to secure passports without their husbands' consent. Citizens require government permission to marry foreigners unless the latter are citizens of Gulf Cooperation Council countries. Permission is not always granted. If a citizen marries a foreigner abroad without approval, the foreign spouse may be denied entry into Oman and any children of the marriage may be denied citizenship of Oman. There is limited freedom of speech and of the press, and self-censorship by journalists and writers is standard practice. Criticizing the sultan is illegal, as are many other kinds of expression, including those that are viewed as offending personal dignity or violating public order. “The penal code prescribes a prison sentence and fine for anyone who publicly blasphemes God or His prophets, commits an affront to religious groups by spoken or written word, or breaches the peace of a lawful religious gathering,” according to a U.S. State Department report issued in 2012. The contents of all print media are subject to official pre-publication review. As of 2010, three prominent authors were prohibited from speaking in public. In the same year, officials banned the display of a number of historical and literary works at the Muscat International Book Fair. The country's eight privately owned newspapers generally follow a pro-government line, and the government's many newspapers, magazines, and radio and TV stations are consistently pro- government. Oman's four private radio and TV stations, for which Oman first issued licenses in October 2005, also tend to hew to a pro-government line. Inhabitants of Oman are allowed to watch satellite TV broadcasts from other countries, and this, along with a rapid increase in Internet penetration (from 9% in 2008 to over 40% in 2010) has “allowed the emergence of social, economic and even political debates.” Oman's government monitors cell-phone conversations, e-mail exchanges, and Internet chat rooms, and restricts free speech on the Internet, blocking access to many websites and posting notices on other sites warning against criticism of the sultan or other officials. In the same way, the government limits the freedom of academics to discuss or write about certain matters, with faculty members engaging in systematic self- censorship. University professors are prohibited from writing about or discussing local politics, and are subject to dismissal if they violate this rule. To form an association requires a permit, which can take years to obtain; in many cases, the government has denied permits. For an association to accept international funding without government approval is a crime punishable by up to six months in prison. All public cultural events and any kind of public meeting must be approved by the government. Religious gatherings are generally permitted, while political gatherings are illegal, as are political parties. Oman first allowed political posters, banners, and TV and newspaper ads in 2007. In 2011, under the influence of the so-called Arab Spring, the number of persons publicly demonstrating for political reform and for jobs increased significantly, and in response Oman tightened its already severe limits on free speech, with police employing excessive force, arresting hundreds, and causing deaths and injuries. Sultan Qaboos pardoned 234 people who had committed “crimes of crowding in the streets.” The Press and Publications Law was made harsher, with the penalty for the publication of certain types of materials set at up to two years in prison plus a fine. Under the law, the editor-in-chief of the Azzamn newspaper, one of his reporters, and a source working for the Ministry of Justice were sentenced to five months in prison over an article that was deemed insulting to the Minister of Justice. In the wake of the nationwide demonstrations of 2011, the government promised to institute reforms. Its failure to do so led to further protests, and on May 31, 2012, it began arresting writers and bloggers who had criticized its inaction. On June 11, it took into custody at least 22 persons who publicly protested these arrests. On July 9 and 16, several individuals were found guilty of “defaming the sultan,” a charge stemming at least in part from Facebook postings and Twitter tweets. Human Rights Watch criticized these prosecutions. “Like people throughout the region, Omanis are sick and tired of having no say in the governance of their country,” said Nadim Houry of HRW. “Rather than listening to legitimate demands and peaceful criticism, Omani authorities are jailing people who speak out.” In 2012, an appeals court affirmed the conviction of 29 human-rights activists on such charges as insulting the sultan and of unlawful assembly, and all but one of them began serving prison sentences. Amnesty International stated its belief “that many, if not all, of those imprisoned are held solely for peacefully exercising their right to freedom of expression or assembly and are therefore prisoners of conscience,” and called on Oman to immediately release all of those being “held simply for peacefully exercising their right to freedom of expression or assembly.” In September 2012, Freedom House criticized the “escalating efforts by the government to tighten its control online and offline following Arab Spring-inspired unrest,” and Front Line Defenders condemned “the ongoing judicial harassment of...human rights defenders and peaceful protesters” and expressed its view that this harassment “is directly related to their legitimate activities in the defense of human rights.” Internet rights Oman is engaged in pervasive Internet filtering in the social area, substantial filtering in Internet tools, selective filtering in political, and there is no evidence of filtering in the conflict/security area according to a report by the OpenNet Initiative in August 2009. Oman engages in extensive filtering of pornographic Web sites, gay and lesbian content, content that is critical of Islam, content about illegal drugs, and anonymizer sites used to circumvent blocking. There is no evidence of technical filtering of political content, but laws and regulations restrict free expression online and encourage self-censorship.\\"ONI Country Profile: Oman\\", OpenNet Initiative, August 2009. Human Rights Watch reported in June 2012 that according to Omani human-rights activists, the government had been increasingly monitoring their online activity; one of the activists said “that authorities hacked into his email account and deleted all his contacts. Others alleged that authorities hacked the Facebook page of the Omani Group for Human Rights and deleted all the postings.” Slavery and treatment of domestic workers The plight of domestic workers in Oman is a taboo subject. In 2011, the Philippines government determined that out of all the countries in the Middle East, only Oman and Israel qualify as safe for Filipino migrants. In 2012, it was reported that every 6 days, an Indian migrant in Oman commits suicide. There has been a campaign urging authorities to check the migrant suicide rate. In the 2014 Global Slavery Index, Oman is ranked #45 due to 26,000 people in slavery. The descendants of servant tribes and slaves are victims of widespread discrimination. Oman was one of the last countries to abolish slavery in 1970. Marriage Omani citizens need government permission to marry foreigners. The Ministry of Interior requires Omani citizens to obtain permission to marry foreigners (except nationals of GCC countries); permission is not automatically granted. Citizen marriage to a foreigner abroad without ministry approval may result in denial of entry for the foreign spouse at the border and preclude children from claiming citizenship rights. It also may result in a bar from government employment and a fine of 2,000 rials ($5,200). Children's rights There are no reports of child prostitution in Oman.Oman - U.S. State Department's 2005 Country Report on Human Rights Practices Child labor is not a problem. In 2003, the government raised the minimum age to work from 13 to 15 years of age. A child born in Oman inherits citizenship from the biological father Primary-school education is free but not compulsory. Oman is not a party to the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. Women's rights Oman is a party to the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and has a government committee that monitors compliance. Although discrimination against women is technically prohibited, with women officially enjoying equality in regard to such matters as employment rights, cultural traditions still reject equality of the sexes, and sharia law continues to enshrine discrimination in practice. (However, the 2012 report by the Bertelsmann Stifting says that “the government passed a law in 2008 stipulating that men’s and women’s legal testimonies should be considered equal.”) Since 2008, women have enjoyed the same property ownership rights as men, and as of 2010, women can marry without parental consent. In accordance with sharia, however, Muslim women cannot marry non-Muslim men, even though Muslim men can marry non-Muslim women. Rape is punishable by up to 15 years in prison, and for cultural and social reasons many rapes probably go unreported. Domestic violence complaints are generally handled by authorities. Female genital mutilation is permitted and widely accepted and practiced, although doctors are not allowed to perform the procedure in health-care facilities. Women receive decent medical treatment, including prenatal and postnatal care. In 2005, Freedom House noted that Oman's women had “made steady progress” over the preceding decade, with women constituting a majority of university students level “despite gender- discriminatory practices in the enrollment process” and making up an “estimated one-third of all civil servants.” In 2012, Bertelsmann Stiftung described the status of women in Oman as follows: “Oman has been successful in enhancing the status of women, who – at least in theory – have the same opportunities as men in public and private jobs. Oman’s government has a deliberate policy of inclusiveness regarding all segments of the population. In reality, however, women...still face high barriers to participation in formal economic activities.” In 2010, Oman celebrated National Oman Women's Day for the first time. Minority groups The descendants of servant tribes and of African slaves who are considered to be of non-Arab blood are the objects of widespread discrimination. Freedom House noted in 2016 that \\"The 1996 basic law banned discrimination on the basis of sex, religion, ethnicity, and social class. However, Omani law does not protect noncitizens from discrimination.” About a quarter of Omani residents “are left without legal protections. In 2003, Human Rights Watch asked Sultan Qaboos to ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and Members of their Families. Disabled rights Disabled people suffer discrimination in Oman. A U.S. State Department report issued in 2012 states that under Omani law “all buildings must have access for disabled individuals,” but a 2011 State Department report makes a distinction, noting that while new buildings are required to be made handicapped-accessible, old buildings are not retrofitted. Although a law requires large private employers to give at least 2 percent of jobs to disabled people, this requirement is not consistently enforced. There is no law requiring equal educational opportunities for disabled persons. The Ministry of Social Development is charged with protecting disabled people's rights. LGBT rights There is considerable discrimination against LGBT persons, and individuals engaging in homosexual conduct are subject to prosecution and can be imprisoned for up to three years. In 2009, nine persons were prosecuted for sodomy. Any discussion whatsoever of sexual orientation in Oman is taboo; LGBT content on the Internet is censored. In 2013, it was announced that all Gulf Cooperative Countries had agreed to establish some form of, yet unknown, testing in order to ban gay foreigners from entering any of the countries. Rights of refugees and asylum seekers Oman has a system in place for helping refugees and asylum seekers, but owing to its tight border controls there are few such persons asking for help. Oman is not a party to the 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees or its 1967 Protocol, and does not protect persons from being returned to countries where they are in danger. In 2010 alone, hundreds of individuals from nearby countries who tried to enter Oman illegally were returned to their homelands. Rights of persons under arrest According to the United States State Department in 2011, Omani law prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention, and the government generally observed these prohibitions. The police academy program includes training in human rights. Police do not have to secure a warrant before taking a suspect into custody, but within 24 hours of such an action the public prosecutor must either make a formal arrest or release the individual, who cannot be held in pretrial detention without a court order. According to the United States State Department in 2011, authorities respected these rights in practice, although foreigners who are suspected of being in Oman illegally are occasionally held without charge until their immigration status can be ascertained. There is a bail system, and defendants can choose their own lawyers, or be provided with public defenders if necessary. Human Rights Watch issued on 2016, that an Omani court sentenced three journalists to prison and ordered the permanent closure of their newspaper, over an article that alleged corruption in the judiciary. The court sentenced two of them to three years in prison and ordered them to pay a fine of 3,000 Omani rials in charge of “disturbing public order,” “misusing the internet,” and “publishing details of a civil case\\". These broad restrictions on reporting appear to violate international standards of freedom of expression, including the right to criticize government officials. Rights of persons on trial Oman's courts are not guided by sharia law. Although the judiciary generally acts independently, the sultan has the power to overrule decisions and grant pardons. Defendants are presumed innocent. There are no juries. Defendants enjoy all the usual rights, including the right to present evidence and appeal decisions, although some judges ask that the fathers or husbands of female defendants accompany them to the courtroom. Rights of prisoners As a rule, prisons meet international standards. Prisoners are allowed to receive visitors and practice their religion. Prison conditions are monitored, and complaints of abuse are addressed by the national human-rights commission. Employees' rights Government employees and domestic workers cannot join unions, but most others can. The government must be notified a month in advance of union meetings. The right to strike is subject to several conditions, one of them being that employers must be informed of planned strikes three weeks in advance. Collective bargaining is allowed. Forced labor is illegal, although some foreigners are apparently engaged in involuntary servitude. Children under 15 are not allowed to work, and there are limits on work by those under 18, although some children work in small family businesses. There is a low minimum wage that does not apply in a number of sectors, and there are various restrictions on working conditions that are not uniformly enforced. Occupational health and safety codes are generally enforced, however.  Rights of speech and freedom of movement  February 2017, Human Rights Watch released a report about the violation of the right of speech and freedom of movement in Oman. In June 2012, Al-Fazari, the founder and editor-in-chief of Mowatin magazine was arrested by Omani authorities, and held in a solitary confinement. The charges included “gathering with the intent of rioting” and “insulting the Sultan\\", yet he was freed, then. On August 30, 2014, he was arrested again, held incommunicado for six days, and then released without charges. In spite of being banned from travelling abroad, he left the country seeking asylum in the United Kingdom on July 17. As a result, his brother, Mahmoud Al-Fazari, was arrested and detained for three weeks but then released without charges as well as his wife, his 3-year-old daughter and his 1-year- old son were prevented going out to the united Arab Emirate.

His greatest success to date has been with Livingston for whom he made over 150 league appearances and won the Scottish League Cup. Career Hearts & Stenhousemuir McKenzie started his career with Heart of Midlothian, signing his first contract in 1993. He did not experience any first team football until he went on a year-long loan at Stenhousemuir in the 1995–96 season. The highlight of his spell at Ochilview Park was Stenhousemuir's victory in the Scottish Challenge Cup, when McKenzie saved a penalty in the 5–4 penalty shootout win against Dundee United, following a 0–0 draw. McKenzie returned to Hearts and played as an understudy to, among others, Gilles Rousset and Antti Niemi. He was never able to establish himself permanently in the first team making 52 starts over 10 years at the Tynecastle club. Livingston & Dunfermline Athletic McKenzie moved from Hearts to Livingston in 2003. McKenzie appeared 119 times during his 3-and-a-half-year spell in West Lothian. Livingston won their first major honour when they defeated Hibernian 2–0 in the 2004 Scottish League Cup Final with goals in the final scored by Derek Lilley and Jamie McAllister. This triumph came amidst a cash crisis and period in administration for Livingston, which severely weakened the playing side. Despite McKenzie's best efforts, the club was relegated after several years of struggle, following the 2005–06 season. In July 2006, McKenzie accepted a contract with Dunfermline Athletic, making his debut against former club Hearts later that month. In the January 2008, McKenzie was released from his contract with Dunfermline after sustaining a bad injury to his back.

Far more famous than the ship itself is the story of the crew who survived the shipwreck, who went on to become slaves of local tribes who captured them. Commerce, sailing from Gibraltar to Cape Verde Islands, was under the command of American Captain James Riley and crewed by 11 others. Most were Americans. After sailing for several days in dense fog, the ship ran aground on a reef near Cape Bojador. After being attacked and ransacked on shore by Sahrawi natives, who killed one of the seamen in cold blood, the crew returned to their rowboat and attempted to reach the Cape Verde Islands or hoped to meet another passing ship. This proved impossible, as their meager provisions were running out, and they decided to return to shore and take their chances with the local tribes. Landing some 300 miles further south down the coast, near Cape Barbas, less than one hundred miles north of Cape Blanco, they were taken captive by nomads of the Oulad Bou Sbaa tribe. The survivors were eventually rescued thanks to James Simpson, the American consul at Tangier, and William Willshire, British Vice Consul to Mogadore (Essaouira), Morocco. Morocco had been the first country to recognize the United States and attempted to maintain generally friendly relations despite the behavior of corsairs and raiders within their borders. The survivors' story of extreme dehydration, severe starvation, and ever-present brutality while roaming the Sahara desert with their captors became a published story, first in the 1820s in retelling by Captain Riley himself, then by Archibald Robbins, a member of his crew, and then in the 2004 account Skeletons on the Zahara: A True Story of Survival by American writer Dean H. King.

Analytic propositions are true solely by virtue of their meaning, whereas synthetic propositions are true based on how their meaning relates to the world. While the distinction was first proposed by Immanuel Kant, it was revised considerably over time, and different philosophers have used the terms in very different ways. Furthermore, some philosophers (starting with W.V.O. Quine) have questioned whether there is even a clear distinction to be made between propositions which are analytically true and propositions which are synthetically true. Debates regarding the nature and usefulness of the distinction continue to this day in contemporary philosophy of language. Kant Immanuel Kant Conceptual containment The philosopher Immanuel Kant uses the terms \\"analytic\\" and \\"synthetic\\" to divide propositions into two types. Kant introduces the analytic–synthetic distinction in the Introduction to his Critique of Pure Reason (1781/1998, A6–7/B10–11). There, he restricts his attention to statements that are affirmative subject–predicate judgments and defines \\"analytic proposition\\" and \\"synthetic proposition\\" as follows: * analytic proposition: a proposition whose predicate concept is contained in its subject concept * synthetic proposition: a proposition whose predicate concept is not contained in its subject concept but related Examples of analytic propositions, on Kant's definition, include: * \\"All bachelors are unmarried.\\" * \\"All triangles have three sides.\\" Kant's own example is: * \\"All bodies are extended,\\" that is, occupy space. (A7/B11) Each of these statements is an affirmative subject–predicate judgment, and, in each, the predicate concept is contained within the subject concept. The concept \\"bachelor\\" contains the concept \\"unmarried\\"; the concept \\"unmarried\\" is part of the definition of the concept \\"bachelor\\". Likewise, for \\"triangle\\" and \\"has three sides\\", and so on. Examples of synthetic propositions, on Kant's definition, include: * \\"All bachelors are alone.\\" * \\"All creatures with hearts have kidneys.\\" Kant's own example is: * \\"All bodies are heavy\\", that is, they experience a gravitational force. (A7/B11) As with the previous examples classified as analytic propositions, each of these new statements is an affirmative subject–predicate judgment. However, in none of these cases does the subject concept contain the predicate concept. The concept \\"bachelor\\" does not contain the concept \\"alone\\"; \\"alone\\" is not a part of the definition of \\"bachelor\\". The same is true for \\"creatures with hearts\\" and \\"have kidneys\\"; even if every creature with a heart also has kidneys, the concept \\"creature with a heart\\" does not contain the concept \\"has kidneys\\". Kant's version and the a priori / a posteriori distinction In the Introduction to the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant contrasts his distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions with another distinction, the distinction between a priori and a posteriori propositions. He defines these terms as follows: * a priori proposition: a proposition whose justification does not rely upon experience. Moreover, the proposition can be validated by experience, but is not grounded in experience. Therefore, it is logically necessary. * a posteriori proposition: a proposition whose justification does rely upon experience. The proposition is validated by, and grounded in, experience. Therefore, it is logically contingent. Examples of a priori propositions include: * \\"All bachelors are unmarried.\\" * \\"7 + 5 = 12.\\" The justification of these propositions does not depend upon experience: one need not consult experience to determine whether all bachelors are unmarried, nor whether . (Of course, as Kant would grant, experience is required to understand the concepts \\"bachelor\\", \\"unmarried\\", \\"7\\", \\"+\\" and so forth. However, the a priori / a posteriori distinction as employed here by Kant refers not to the origins of the concepts but to the justification of the propositions. Once we have the concepts, experience is no longer necessary.) Examples of a posteriori propositions include: * \\"All bachelors are unhappy.\\" * \\"Tables exist.\\" Both of these propositions are a posteriori: any justification of them would require one's experience. The analytic/synthetic distinction and the a priori / a posteriori distinction together yield four types of propositions: # analytic a priori # synthetic a priori # analytic a posteriori # synthetic a posteriori Kant posits the third type as obviously self-contradictory. Ruling it out, he discusses only the remaining three types as components of his epistemological frameworkeach, for brevity's sake, becoming, respectively, \\"analytic\\", \\"synthetic a priori\\", and \\"empirical\\" or \\"a posteriori\\" propositions. This triad will account for all propositions possible. Examples of analytic and a posteriori statements have already been given, for synthetic a priori propositions he gives those in mathematics and physics. The ease of knowing analytic propositions Part of Kant's argument in the Introduction to the Critique of Pure Reason involves arguing that there is no problem figuring out how knowledge of analytic propositions is possible. To know an analytic proposition, Kant argued, one need not consult experience. Instead, one needs merely to take the subject and \\"extract from it, in accordance with the principle of contradiction, the required predicate\\" (A7/B12). In analytic propositions, the predicate concept is contained in the subject concept. Thus, to know an analytic proposition is true, one need merely examine the concept of the subject. If one finds the predicate contained in the subject, the judgment is true. Thus, for example, one need not consult experience to determine whether \\"All bachelors are unmarried\\" is true. One need merely examine the subject concept (\\"bachelors\\") and see if the predicate concept \\"unmarried\\" is contained in it. And in fact, it is: \\"unmarried\\" is part of the definition of \\"bachelor\\" and so is contained within it. Thus the proposition \\"All bachelors are unmarried\\" can be known to be true without consulting experience. It follows from this, Kant argued, first: All analytic propositions are a priori; there are no a posteriori analytic propositions. It follows, second: There is no problem understanding how we can know analytic propositions; we can know them because we only need to consult our concepts in order to determine that they are true. The possibility of metaphysics After ruling out the possibility of analytic a posteriori propositions, and explaining how we can obtain knowledge of analytic a priori propositions, Kant also explains how we can obtain knowledge of synthetic a posteriori propositions. That leaves only the question of how knowledge of synthetic a priori propositions is possible. This question is exceedingly important, Kant maintains, because all scientific knowledge (for him Newtonian physics and mathematics) is made up of synthetic a priori propositions. If it is impossible to determine which synthetic a priori propositions are true, he argues, then metaphysics as a discipline is impossible. The remainder of the Critique of Pure Reason is devoted to examining whether and how knowledge of synthetic a priori propositions is possible. See Cooper Harold Langford (1949)'s ostensive proof: Logical positivists Frege and Carnap revise the Kantian definition Over a hundred years later, a group of philosophers took interest in Kant and his distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions: the logical positivists. Part of Kant's examination of the possibility of synthetic a priori knowledge involved the examination of mathematical propositions, such as * \\"7 + 5 = 12.\\" (B15–16) * \\"The shortest distance between two points is a straight line.\\" (B16–17) Kant maintained that mathematical propositions such as these are synthetic a priori propositions, and that we know them. That they are synthetic, he thought, is obvious: the concept \\"equal to 12\\" is not contained within the concept \\"7 + 5\\"; and the concept \\"straight line\\" is not contained within the concept \\"the shortest distance between two points\\". From this, Kant concluded that we have knowledge of synthetic a priori propositions. Gottlob Frege's notion of analyticity included a number of logical properties and relations beyond containment: symmetry, transitivity, antonymy, or negation and so on. He had a strong emphasis on formality, in particular formal definition, and also emphasized the idea of substitution of synonymous terms. \\"All bachelors are unmarried\\" can be expanded out with the formal definition of bachelor as \\"unmarried man\\" to form \\"All unmarried men are unmarried\\", which is recognizable as tautologous and therefore analytic from its logical form: any statement of the form \\"All X that are (F and G) are F\\". Using this particular expanded idea of analyticity, Frege concluded that Kant's examples of arithmetical truths are analytical a priori truths and not synthetic a priori truths. (Here \\"logical empiricist\\" is a synonym for \\"logical positivist\\".) The origin of the logical positivist's distinction The logical positivists agreed with Kant that we have knowledge of mathematical truths, and further that mathematical propositions are a priori. However, they did not believe that any complex metaphysics, such as the type Kant supplied, are necessary to explain our knowledge of mathematical truths. Instead, the logical positivists maintained that our knowledge of judgments like \\"all bachelors are unmarried\\" and our knowledge of mathematics (and logic) are in the basic sense the same: all proceeded from our knowledge of the meanings of terms or the conventions of language. Logical positivist definitions Thus the logical positivists drew a new distinction, and, inheriting the terms from Kant, named it the \\"analytic/synthetic distinction\\". They provided many different definitions, such as the following: # analytic proposition: a proposition whose truth depends solely on the meaning of its terms # analytic proposition: a proposition that is true (or false) by definition # analytic proposition: a proposition that is made true (or false) solely by the conventions of language (While the logical positivists believed that the only necessarily true propositions were analytic, they did not define \\"analytic proposition\\" as \\"necessarily true proposition\\" or \\"proposition that is true in all possible worlds\\".) Synthetic propositions were then defined as: * synthetic proposition: a proposition that is not analytic These definitions applied to all propositions, regardless of whether they were of subject–predicate form. Thus, under these definitions, the proposition \\"It is raining or it is not raining\\" was classified as analytic, while for Kant it was analytic by virtue of its logical form. And the proposition \\"\\" was classified as analytic, while under Kant's definitions it was synthetic. Two-dimensionalism Two- dimensionalism is an approach to semantics in analytic philosophy. It is a theory of how to determine the sense and reference of a word and the truth- value of a sentence. It is intended to resolve a puzzle that has plagued philosophy for some time, namely: How is it possible to discover empirically that a necessary truth is true? Two-dimensionalism provides an analysis of the semantics of words and sentences that makes sense of this possibility. The theory was first developed by Robert Stalnaker, but it has been advocated by numerous philosophers since, including David Chalmers and Berit Brogaard. Any given sentence, for example, the words, :\\"Water is H2O\\" is taken to express two distinct propositions, often referred to as a primary intension and a secondary intension, which together compose its meaning. The primary intension of a word or sentence is its sense, i.e., is the idea or method by which we find its referent. The primary intension of \\"water\\" might be a description, such as watery stuff. The thing picked out by the primary intension of \\"water\\" could have been otherwise. For example, on some other world where the inhabitants take \\"water\\" to mean watery stuff, but, where the chemical make-up of watery stuff is not H2O, it is not the case that water is H2O for that world. The secondary intension of \\"water\\" is whatever thing \\"water\\" happens to pick out in this world, whatever that world happens to be. So if we assign \\"water\\" the primary intension watery stuff then the secondary intension of \\"water\\" is H2O, since H2O is watery stuff in this world. The secondary intension of \\"water\\" in our world is H2O, which is H2O in every world because unlike watery stuff it is impossible for H2O to be other than H2O. When considered according to its secondary intension, \\"Water is H2O\\" is true in every world. If two-dimensionalism is workable it solves some very important problems in the philosophy of language. Saul Kripke has argued that \\"Water is H2O\\" is an example of the necessary a posteriori, since we had to discover that water was H2O, but given that it is true, it cannot be false. It would be absurd to claim that something that is water is not H2O, for these are known to be identical. Quine's criticisms Rudolf Carnap was a strong proponent of the distinction between what he called \\"internal questions\\", questions entertained within a \\"framework\\" (like a mathematical theory), and \\"external questions\\", questions posed outside any framework – posed before the adoption of any framework. The \\"internal\\" questions could be of two types: logical (or analytic, or logically true) and factual (empirical, that is, matters of observation interpreted using terms from a framework). The \\"external\\" questions were also of two types: those that were confused pseudo-questions (\\"one disguised in the form of a theoretical question\\") and those that could be re-interpreted as practical, pragmatic questions about whether a framework under consideration was \\"more or less expedient, fruitful, conducive to the aim for which the language is intended\\". The adjective \\"synthetic\\" was not used by Carnap in his 1950 work Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology. Carnap did define a \\"synthetic truth\\" in his work Meaning and Necessity: a sentence that is true, but not simply because \\"the semantical rules of the system suffice for establishing its truth\\". The notion of a synthetic truth is of something that is true both because of what it means and because of the way the world is, whereas analytic truths are true in virtue of meaning alone. Thus, what Carnap calls internal factual statements (as opposed to internal logical statements) could be taken as being also synthetic truths because they require observations, but some external statements also could be \\"synthetic\\" statements and Carnap would be doubtful about their status. The analytic–synthetic argument therefore is not identical with the internal–external distinction. In 1951, Willard Van Orman Quine published the essay \\"Two Dogmas of Empiricism\\" in which he argued that the analytic–synthetic distinction is untenable. The argument at bottom is that there are no \\"analytic\\" truths, but all truths involve an empirical aspect. In the first paragraph, Quine takes the distinction to be the following: * analytic propositions – propositions grounded in meanings, independent of matters of fact. * synthetic propositions – propositions grounded in fact. Quine's position denying the analytic–synthetic distinction is summarized as follows: To summarize Quine's argument, the notion of an analytic proposition requires a notion of synonymy, but establishing synonymy inevitably leads to matters of fact – synthetic propositions. Thus, there is no non-circular (and so no tenable) way to ground the notion of analytic propositions. While Quine's rejection of the analytic–synthetic distinction is widely known, the precise argument for the rejection and its status is highly debated in contemporary philosophy. However, some (for example, Paul Boghossian) argue that Quine's rejection of the distinction is still widely accepted among philosophers, even if for poor reasons. Responses Paul Grice and P. F. Strawson criticized \\"Two Dogmas\\" in their 1956 article \\"In Defense of a Dogma\\". Among other things, they argue that Quine's skepticism about synonyms leads to a skepticism about meaning. If statements can have meanings, then it would make sense to ask \\"What does it mean?\\". If it makes sense to ask \\"What does it mean?\\", then synonymy can be defined as follows: Two sentences are synonymous if and only if the true answer of the question \\"What does it mean?\\" asked of one of them is the true answer to the same question asked of the other. They also draw the conclusion that discussion about correct or incorrect translations would be impossible given Quine's argument. Four years after Grice and Strawson published their paper, Quine's book Word and Object was released. In the book Quine presented his theory of indeterminacy of translation. In Speech Acts, John Searle argues that from the difficulties encountered in trying to explicate analyticity by appeal to specific criteria, it does not follow that the notion itself is void. Considering the way which we would test any proposed list of criteria, which is by comparing their extension to the set of analytic statements, it would follow that any explication of what analyticity means presupposes that we already have at our disposal a working notion of analyticity. In \\"'Two Dogmas' Revisited\\", Hilary Putnam argues that Quine is attacking two different notions: Analytic truth defined as a true statement derivable from a tautology by putting synonyms for synonyms is near Kant's account of analytic truth as a truth whose negation is a contradiction. Analytic truth defined as a truth confirmed no matter what, however, is closer to one of the traditional accounts of a priori. While the first four sections of Quine's paper concern analyticity, the last two concern a priority. Putnam considers the argument in the two last sections as independent of the first four, and at the same time as Putnam criticizes Quine, he also emphasizes his historical importance as the first top rank philosopher to both reject the notion of a priority and sketch a methodology without it. Jerrold Katz, a one-time associate of Noam Chomsky, countered the arguments of \\"Two Dogmas\\" directly by trying to define analyticity non- circularly on the syntactical features of sentences. Chomsky himself critically discussed Quine's conclusion, arguing that it is possible to identify some analytic truths (truths of meaning, not truths of facts) which are determined by specific relations holding among some innate conceptual features of the mind/brain. In Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century, Volume 1: The Dawn of Analysis, Scott Soames has pointed out that Quine's circularity argument needs two of the logical positivists' central theses to be effective: :All necessary (and all a priori) truths are analytic :Analyticity is needed to explain and legitimate necessity. It is only when these two theses are accepted that Quine's argument holds. It is not a problem that the notion of necessity is presupposed by the notion of analyticity if necessity can be explained without analyticity. According to Soames, both theses were accepted by most philosophers when Quine published \\"Two Dogmas\\". Today, however, Soames holds both statements to be antiquated. He says: \\"Very few philosophers today would accept either [of these assertions], both of which now seem decidedly antique.\\" In other fields This distinction was imported from philosophy into theology, with Albrecht Ritschl attempting to demonstrate that Kant's epistemology was compatible with Lutheranism.Stephen Palmquist (1989) Immanuel Kant: A Christian Philosopher?, page 71 See also * Holophrastic indeterminacy * Paradox of analysis Footnotes References and further reading  Boghossian, Paul.

History  Engine 88 (originally known as simply Engine) released three albums (2 on Caroline Records) and a handful of 7 inch singles throughout the 1990s. The band featured Tom Barnes of the notable college rock band Sordid Humor as lead singer, Damon Wood of Smoking Section on guitar, Eric Knight on bass and Dave Hawkins (also of Smoking Section) on the drums. Their first two releases, two 7 inch singles, Funny Car and Twenty were put out independently on their own label, Shut Up and Drive in 1993 and 1994, respectively. In 1995, their first full length LP, Clean Your Room was released on Caroline Records, defining their characteristic sound of driving guitars and rhythms counter-acted with introspective and often abstract lyrics. 1997's Snowman followed, to much critical acclaim. On July 2, 1997, Counting Crows kicked off a co-headlining tour with The Wallflowers that continued through September. This tour included opening acts by Bettie Serveert, Engine 88, Gigolo Aunts, and That Dog, with each opening band touring for a three-week stretch.Billboard Magazine, May 24, 1997, Page 16 (link accessed January 14, 2015) While touring with Counting Crows, The Wallflowers were also playing their own headlining dates when the Counting Crows tour was on break (Counting Crows frontman Adam Duritz experienced swollen vocal cords and had to back out of several shows in July).http://www.mtv.com/news/1427546/counting-crows-counted-in-again/ In 1998 the group disbanded and their final full-length, Flies and Death n' Stuff was released posthumously in 1998 on Wingnut Records. At the prompting of Jawbreaker, Engine 88 agreed to reunite for an appearance at Chicago's Riot Fest on Sept 17, 2017.  Where are they now?  Singer Tom Barnes released a CD entitled Three Day Ditties, which abandoned the louder rock sound of Engine 88, in favor of a more soft rock sound similar to that of his former project, Sordid Humor. His songs have gained a cult following and have been covered live by the band Counting Crows. Guitarist Damon Wood is now a Software Engineer at Pandora performing in a Pretenders tribute band, Message of Love, and in an R&B; cover band, Curtis Bumpy, in the San Francisco Bay Area. Bassist Eric Knight works at UC Berkeley and trains and coaches martial arts at SBG NorCal. Engine 88 played a \\"reunion\\" show commemorating the release of Peter Ellenby's book, Every Day is Saturday at the Bottom of the Hill in San Francisco on Friday, Oct 27 2006. Drummer, Dave Hawkins, opened a popular movie rental store, Lost Weekend Video, in San Francisco, with Christy Colcord who previously booked European tours for many US punk bands including Green Day and Adam Pfahler of Jawbreaker.

Biography Background Born in Varkaus, Pohjois- Savo, Keskisalo took a medal in the junior race at the Nordic Cross Country Championships, winning the bronze in 2000. Senior athletics career =2000s= Keskisalo finished ninth at the 2003 World Championships in Athletics in Paris with his then personal best time, 8:17.72. The next two seasons were hampered by injuries, but he made a strong comeback in 2006 by taking surprise gold at the 2006 European Championships in Athletics. He ran a tactical race, taking advantage of a slow early pace and staying at the rear of the field until the last 500 metres, when he sprinted and overtook the other competitors one by one. Less than a week after the European Championships, Keskisalo placed fourth at the Golden League meet in Zürich with his new record time 8:16.74. Later, Keskisalo was voted Finnish Sportspersonality of the year, ahead of Tanja Poutiainen and Tero Pitkämäki. In 2007 Keskisalo suffered from injuries again. In 2008 he competed for a place in and was selected for the Olympics, however he injured just a few days before his event and was not able to compete. Later in the autumn it was announced that Risto Ulmala would replace Tommy Ekblom as his coach. In 2009 Keskisalo broke his personal best record time twice before the World Championships in Berlin; first a time of 8:15.59 when finishing third at the Golden League event Meeting Areva in Paris, and later a time of 8:12.93 at the Super Grand Prix event Herculis in Monaco. At the World Championships steeplechase final Keskisalo achieved his best result at the global level when finishing eighth with a time of 8:14.47. On 28 August Keskisalo finally broke Tapio Kantanen's 33 years old Finnish record when finishing sixth in a time of 8:10.67 in Weltklasse Zürich. Keskisalo split from coach Ulmala after the 2009 season. His new coach Ismo Hämäläinen was announced in October 2009.

Newcastle United At Newcastle United, Pérez was fourth-choice behind Steve Harper, Shay Given and John Karelse; he never made a competitive start for the Magpies and after being loaned to various clubs throughout his 21-month spell on Tyneside, he was granted a free transfer to Cambridge United in July 2000, reportedly taking a 95% pay cut to do so. Later career Pérez was released by Cambridge at the end of the 2002–03 season, before joining Enfield in October 2002, and then Stevenage Borough in February 2003, after a short stint at Chelmsford City. He was a regular for Stevenage until in March 2004 (being voted Player of the Year), he broke his leg playing in a league match against Barnet. Pérez was forced to retire at the end of the season, and he immediately took up a coaching role at the club. Pérez left his coaching role at the club in April 2006. Coaching career On leaving Stevenage, Perez and his family moved back to France where he had spells coaching at FC PHA Chusclan Laudun and SO-Cassis Carnoux.

Pete Zorn on stage with the Arizona Smoke Revue in 1982 (Pete Zorn at right, playing electric bass guitar) Although he frequently toured with Thompson, Zorn had also played with many other singers and groups including Arizona Smoke Revue, formed by older brother Bill Zorn, Show of Hands, the Phil Beer Band, Elaine Paige, Thomas Anders, Gerry Rafferty, Barbara Dickson, Chris Rainbow, and his band WAZ, which features Steve Tilston. He appeared in the UK top 10 in 1979 as part of Driver 67 with his brother-in-law Paul Phillips on the single \\"Car 67\\". He and Phillips met when Zorn came to London with Fishbaugh, Fishbaugh, and Zorn, a three-piece folk rock band signed to CBS Records in London. Because of his talent on so many instruments and his vocal range, Zorn became a staple of many sessions produced by Phillips in the early and mid-seventies. After the hit with Car 67, they made an album called Hey Mister Record Man, under the name Tax Loss. Bill and Conrad Zorn also played. In 1988 Zorn played the saxophone to the theme song of the British children's television series TUGS (which only aired on ITV once in 1989 and only lasted for 13 episodes) with the series' composers Mike O'Donnell and Junior Campbell (who were also friends of his and have also composed music for the original series of Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends of whom many of the crew members including former director David Mitton had worked on TUGS) composing the music. In 2009 Zorn joined Steeleye Span on the spring section of the band's 40th anniversary tour, replacing Rick Kemp, who was absent for health reasons. He also replaced Kemp on the American and Australian legs of the tour. Kemp returned for the winter leg of the tour, but Zorn stayed with the band as a guitarist and multi-instrumentalist due to various strains on the band. He played on the albums Now We Are Six Again and Wintersmith and appeared on all Steeleye tours until spring 2015, when he left the band. Death Zorn died on April 19, 2016, following a battle with cancer. His death was announced by Zorn's family, and by Thompson, on their respective Facebook pages.

C. R., Haberle, R. M., and T. I. Michaels, 2001: The Mars Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (MRAMS): Model description and selected simulations. Icarus, 151, 228-256. MRAMS, developed by Scot Rafkin and Timothy Michaels, is derived from the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) developed by William R. Cotton and Roger A. Pielke to study atmospheric circulations on the Earth.Pielke, R. A.; Cotton, W. R.; Walko, R. L.; Tremback, C. J.; Lyons, W. A.; Grasso, L. D.; Nicholls, M. E.; Moran, M. D.; Wesley, D. A.; Lee, T. J.; Copeland, J. H., 1992: A comprehensive meteorological modeling system: RAMS Meteorology and Atmospheric Physics, vol. 49, issue 1-4, pp. 69-91. Key features of MRAMS include a non-hydrostatic, fully compressible dynamics, explicit bin dust, water, and carbon dioxide ice atmospheric physics model, and a fully prognostic regolith model that includes carbon dioxide deposition and sublimation. Several Mars exploration projects, including the Mars Exploration Rovers,Rafkin, S. C. R. and T. I. Michaels, 2003: Meteorological predictions for 2003 Mars Exploration Rover high-priority landing sites. J. Geophys. Res., 108 No. E12,10.1029/2002JE002027 the Phoenix Scout Mission, and the Mars Science Laboratory have used MRAMS to study a variety of atmospheric circulations. The MRAMS operates at the mesoscale and microscale, modeling and simulating the Martian atmosphere. The smaller scale modeling of the MRAMS gives it higher resolution data points and models over complex terrain and topography. It is able to identify topography driven flows like katabatic and anabatic winds through valleys and mountains that produce changes in atmospheric circulation.  Structure   Dynamic Core  The dynamic core's role is to solve fluid mechanic equations related to atmospheric dynamics. The equations in the dynamic core of the MRAMS are based on primitive grid-volume Reynolds-averaged equations. The related equations are meant to solve for momentum, thermodynamics, tracers, and conservation of mass. The MRAMS dynamical core integrates equations for momentum, thermodynamics (atmosphere-surface heat exchange), tracers, and conservation of mass. = Parameterizations = The MRAMS dynamical core was developed from RAMS and has been changed excessively to account for the large difference in atmospheres between Mars and Earth. Some MRAMS models parameterize numerous features including dust and dust lifting, cloud microphysics, radiative transfer, and steep topography.  Grid  The MRAMS operates on the mesoscale and therefore is a regional tool not global, making it accurate for data collection around complex terrain and changing topography. The computational grid types developed for the MRAMS are of the Arakawa C-type. The grid spacing is irregular and requires the use of scaling. The high resolution of the MRAMS stems from the use of the nested two-way grid system. The two-way grid system incorporates a parent grid that establishes initial boundary layers to be used and by the finer grid for accurate data collection. References External links * MRAMS homepage.

This diagram can include internal parts, ports through which the parts interact with each other or through which instances of the class interact with the parts and with the outside world, and connectors between parts or ports. A composite structure is a set of interconnected elements that collaborate at runtime to achieve some purpose. Each element has some defined role in the collaboration.  Concepts  The key composite structure entities identified in the UML 2.0 specification are structured classifiers, parts, ports, connectors, and collaborations.OMG (2008). OMG Unified Modeling Language (OMG UML), Superstructure, V2.1.2 p.161-192. * Part : A part represents a role played at runtime by one instance of a classifier or by a collection of instances. The part may only name the role, it may name an abstract superclass, or it may name a specific concrete class. The part can include a multiplicity factor, such as the [0..*] shown for Viewer in the diagram. * Port : A port is an interaction point that can be used to connect structured classifiers with their parts and with the environment. Ports can optionally specify the services they provide and the services they require from other parts of the system. In the diagram, each of the small squares is a port. Each port has a type and is labelled with a name, such as \\"var\\", \\"indVar1\\", or \\"view\\" in the diagram. Ports may contain a multiplicity factor, for example [3]. :Ports can either delegate received requests to internal parts, or they can deliver these directly to the behavior of the structured classifier that the port is contained within. Public ports that are visible in the environment are shown straddling the boundary, while protected ports that are not visible in the environment are shown inside the boundary. All the ports in the diagram are public, except for the view port along the right boundary of FibonacciSystem. * Connector : A connector binds two or more entities together, allowing them to interact at runtime. The connector is shown as a line between some combination of parts, ports and structured classifiers. The diagram shows three connectors between ports, and one connector between a structured classifier and a part. * Collaboration : A collaboration is generally more abstract than a structured classifier. It is shown as a dotted oval containing roles that instances can play in the collaboration. * Structured classifier : A StructuredClassifier represents a class, often an abstract class, whose behavior can be completely or partially described through interactions between parts. * Encapsulated classifier : An EncapsulatedClassifier is a type of structured classifier that contains ports. In the diagram below, both FibonacciSystem and Variable are encapsulated classifiers because they both have ports along their boundaries.  Examples  UML 2.0 composite structure diagram. As an example, consider one possible way of modeling production of the Fibonacci sequence. This UML 2.0 composite structure diagram specifies that instances of the 'FibonacciSystem' class are composed of a number of parts. The topmost of these parts is identified as having the classifier 'FibonacciFunction'. Three of the parts are identified by the role they play within instances of FibonacciSystem - the NMinus2 role, the NMinus1 role, and the N role. The fifth part, identified by its classifier Viewer, includes a multiplicity specification. At runtime there can be 0 or more instances of Viewer or some concrete subclass of Viewer. At runtime the class instances that implement these three roles must provide the services specified by the IVar interface through their var ports. One such class is Variable, shown on the diagram with a port named var of type Var that realizes the IVar interface. The port named \\"view\\" is a non-public port that can be used by an instance of FibonacciSystem to access the optional instance(s) of Viewer.

It is part of DeKalb Community Unit School District 428. History DeKalb High School dates its founding to the early 1900s as \\"DeKalb Township High School.\\" The original campus was located on North First Street, now the site of Clinton Rosette Middle School. Then, constructed in 1967, a new campus building was completed on South Fourth Street and Barb Blvd., with three classroom and facility additions since then. During the 1990s and through 2008, the district experienced strong growth, resulting in severe overcrowding. On February 5, 2008, voters in the district approved a referendum to construct a new high school facility on Dresser Road; east of Annie Glidden Road. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on May 27, 2009. It opened for the 2011-2012 school year. The former campus has been repurposed for use as Huntley Middle School, the former Huntley Middle school has been repurposed as Founders Elementary School, and the former Chesebro Elementary was repurposed as an Early Childhood/Pre-K Center. Academics In 2014, DeKalb had an average composite ACT score of 25.3, and graduated 96.6% of its senior class. In addition, the school placed in the top 10% of schools in the nation, according to US News. Athletics DeKalb's 22 athletic teams are known as the Barbs. This name comes from the fact that barbed wire was invented in DeKalb. Over the past century DeKalb has been a charter member of six high school athletic conferences: The Northern Illinois Football Conference in 1916, the North Central Illinois Conference in 1929, the Upstate Eight Conference in 1963, the Western Sun Conference in 2006, the Northern Illinois Big 12 Conference in 2010 and has been a member of the DuPage Valley Conference since 2019. DeKalb is a member of the Illinois High School Association. National recognition On February 7, 2009, the DHS basketball team gained national acclaim for an act of sportsmanship in a game against Milwaukee Madison High School. Just hours before the game began, Madison's senior captain Johntell Franklin learned of his mother's death. He initially informed his coach he would not play that night, but later came to the game and asked his coach to let him play. Since Franklin was not listed on the team roster, Madison would incur a technical foul, and DeKalb would get two free throws. DeKalb player Darius McNeal volunteered to take the free throws, and intentionally missed both, by rolling the ball out of bounds. Once the Madison team and fans realized that DeKalb had negated the foul to show support for Franklin, they stood and applauded. This act was reported extensively in the media, including ESPN.com,http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=3925981 yahoo.com, World News Tonight, and the Lou Dobbs Report.http://www.courier- journal.com/blogs/catsfan/2009/02/all-about-greatness-in- sports.htmlhttp://bleacherreport.com/articles/126119-the-two-greatest-missed- free-throws-supports-grieving- opponenthttp://www.tampabay.com/sports/article1007132.ece Music *In 2008 and 2012 the DHS Jazz Ensemble was named a finalist in the Essentially Ellington jazz ensemble competition, one of only 15 bands from all of North America to receive such honors. *The Dekalb High School Guys' A Cappella group, Fly Check, won the ICHSA Midwest regional championship in 2007 and 2008, and they attended nationals in New York City both years.

Tens of boyar families sought refuge in Transylvania & Poland. He further compromised his position by removing the bishop Macarie of Roman (town in central Moldavia) in 1549 but he had to reinstate him in early 1551. At the same time he made a large donation to Voroneț Monastery, where Vartic was buried in a gesture of reconciliation. In the last months of his reign, as he increasingly realized that his political situation was becoming untenable, he amassed as much treasure as he could and stated publicly that he wished to go to the sultan in Istanbul with the due tribute and to persuade him to decrease the fiscal obligations of the country. 100 boyars accompanied him to Istanbul to ensure that he would at least pay that years tribute from the treasury that he carried with him.http://www.medievistica.ro/pagini/istorie/texte/cercetarea/ilias- rares/O%20DANIE%20RARES2.pdf He renounced the throne in front of the sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, converted to Islam, took the name Mehmet on May 1551.

(In the Cree language: ᐋᐧᓇᐢᑫᐃᐧᐣ / wânaskêwin means, \\"being at peace with oneself\\".) The site is a National Historic Site of Canada due to the importance of its archaeological resources representing nearly 6000 years of the history of the Northern Plains peoples. In 2016, it was announced that Wanuskewin intends to seek UNESCO World Heritage designation, which would make it the first World Heritage Site in Saskatchewan. Background The Saskatchewan Wanuskewin Indian Heritage Incorporated (WIHI) organization was established to present the interests of regional First Nations in planning the park. The Wanuskewin Heritage Park Authority (WHPA) is in turn a 12 member organization responsible for the operation of the park. The WHPA board has representation from the first nations community, Government of Canada, Province of Saskatchewan, City of Saskatoon, University of Saskatchewan and Meewasin Valley Authority and the Friends of Wanuskewin. For more than 6,000 years people have gathered at this place. The migratory nations who roamed the Northern Plains came to hunt bison, gather food and herbs, and to find shelter from the winter winds. Some of the sites uncovered date back thousands of years. Wanuskewin is also the site of an arrangement of boulders called a medicine wheel, of which fewer than 100 remain on the northern plains. Wanuskewin Heritage Park is located near the west bank of the South Saskatchewan River, just three kilometers north of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan(/ˌsæskəˈtuːn/) . Within its 240 hectares (about 600 acres) there are 19 sites that represent the active and historical society of Northern Plains Peoples composed of Cree, Assiniboine, Saulteaux, Atsina, Dakota, and Blackfoot. On site there are summer and winter camp sites, bison kill sites, tipi rings, and artifacts such as pottery fragments, plant seeds, projectile points, egg shells and animal bones, all within a compact area. Wanuskewin Heritage Park officially opened in June 1992; however scientific investigations in the area began in the early 1930s. Today, the University of Saskatchewan manages an archaeological research program at Wanuskewin with active archaeological digs. The Park was designated a Provincial Heritage Property in 1984, the only such site in Saskatchewan featuring prehistoric artifacts. It was named a National Historic Site in 1986. The following year Queen Elizabeth II unveiled a dedication plaque. In 2001, Prince Charles, was named Pisimwa Kamiwohkitahpamikohk, or, “the sun looks at him in a good way”, by an elder in a ceremony at Wanuskewin. Wanuskewin's mission is to operate, on a sustainable basis, a Heritage Park under the leadership and guidance of First Nations people that contributes to increasing public awareness, understanding and appreciation of the cultural legacy of the Northern Plains First Nations people. During the peak summer season about 40–45 people are employed at the park.

It is an IDE device supporting PIO mode 1 transfer, and includes 128 MiB SRAM.Accelerator - initial development HyperDrive II After the SRAM Accelerator, it was switched to SDRAM, and uses 5.25-inch form factor, which allows the company to build Accelerator with capacity of 128 MiB to 4 GiB. It had maximum random access time of 0.15 ms. SDRAM was chosen over flash because of its speed advantage and reliability over flash memory.Accelerated Logic B.V.: Introduction Later generation uses 3.5-inch form factor and supports UDMA 33 transfer speed, with maximum capacity of 14 GiB. It uses Atmel controller. It includes battery backup mechanism. Future plan included support of UDMA66, Fibre Channel interface. HyperDrive III It uses Parallel ATA (PATA) (max 100 MB/s) or Serial ATA (SATA) interface. For the first time, memory capacity can be changed by using memory slots. It uses ECC DDR SDRAM (max 2 GiB per DIMM). Maximum capacity started at 6 DIMM (12 GiB), and was later changed to 8 DIMM (16 GiB). Non-volatile storage is achieved using an integral 160 minute 7.2 V battery backup battery (1250 mAh), external adapter, or HyperOs software. It uses Xilinx Spartan FPGA and Atmel controller array. The circuit board was produced by DCE. HyperDrive 4 It supports both SATA and PATA interfaces (PATA native), with interface speed up to 133 MB/s. It uses ECC DDR SDRAM (max 2 GiB per DIMM). Maximum capacity is 8 DIMM (16 GiB, PC1600-PC3200). Memory of different sizes can be mixed, but only if DIMMs of same capacity are used in 1 bank (4 DIMM/bank). It supports non-volatile memory backup using optional 2.5-inch PATA drive, HyperOs software (which swaps RAM contents to a different drive) or backup battery (5 Ah or 10 Ah). The drive is rated 125 MB/s data rate, 44k I/O per second. Revision 3 It supports registered ECC SDRAM, with capacity up to 2 GiB per DIMM on 16 GiB version and 4 GiB per DIMM on 32 GiB version. Seek time was reduced from 40 microseconds to 1100 nanoseconds read and 250 nanoseconds write. It also reduces the power consumption by 30% and employs gold plated DIMM sockets. HyperDrive 4 Rack-mounted It is a rack-mounted version of the device with at most four drives. HyperDrive4 RAID Systems It is an external case version with four HyperDrive4 drives. It uses PCI-X or PCI Express x8 interface, with Silicon Image 3124 or Areca 12XX SAT RAID card to connect each drive.The key new features within the HyperOs flagship products HyperDrive 5 It uses SATA interface with 2x SATA2 interface ports. It uses DDR2 SDRAM (max 8 GiB per DIMM). Manufacturer claimed it has built-in ECC so it no longer requires ECC memory, but ECC is performed at the expense of storage capacity if ECC memory is not used. Memory speed is not rated; the manufacturer recommends Kingston ValueRAM (PC2-3200 to PC2-6400). HyperDrive 5 includes 7.4 V 2400 mAh lithium battery for flash backup, CompactFlash card slot, with external DC adapter for non-volatile storage. The drive is rated 175 MB/s read, 145 MB/s write, 40k (later 65k) I/O per second, when using only one of the SATA2 links. The rated speed using the dual SATA2 links is not given by the manufacturer. When using both SATA2 links, the physical drive can be configured as a RAID 0 array with two devices with half of maximum capacity. In RAID 0 mode, the read and write speeds are reported to be more than twice those that are claimed by the manufacturer.ACARD ANS-9010 Ramdisk Review Drive controller is switched to Taiwanese ASIC, instead of the Xilinx Spartan FPGA/Atmel array. HyperDrive 5 is also sold as ACard ANS-9010,ACard's ANS-9010 Serial ATA RAM disk outside of the UK. HyperDrive 5M A cheaper version of the Hyperdrive5, with only one SATA2 port and 6 DDR2 slots, so that memory is limited to 48 GiB. Performance and features are the same as the HyperDrive5 when using only one SATA2 link. HyperDrive 5M is sold as ACard ANS-9010B, outside of the UK.

Lord Mayor of Manchester in 1921–1922, he was a member of parliament for two terms between 1923 and 1931 before being elevated to the peerage and serving as the Chairman of the BBC Board of Governors. Early life and family Simon was born in Didsbury, Manchester, as the eldest son of Henry Gustav Simon and Emily Stoehr. He was educated at Rugby School and studied mechanical sciences at Pembroke College, Cambridge. In 1912 he married Shena Dorothy Potter (1883–1972), a noted social reformer. They had three children: Roger, a solicitor and journalist; Brian, an educationalist and historian; and a daughter Antonia (Tony) who died in childhood. His nephew is C. G. H. Simon. Engineering After leaving Cambridge on the death of his father, he entered the family's engineering business, Simon Carves, manufacturers of flour milling machinery and coke ovens. He successfully expanded the company into building grain silos, and with the wealth generated by the business pursued outside interests, including politics. Political and public life Simon served as a member of Manchester City Council from 1912 to 1925, and as Lord Mayor of Manchester in 1921–1922, the youngest person at the time to have held the office. He is chiefly remembered for the slum clearances and housing projects he initiated in the city. He purchased Wythenshawe Hall and park from Robert Henry Grenville Tatton in 1926 and donated them to the city; the estate farmland became one on Britain's largest housing estates, Wythenshawe. Simon sat as a Liberal Member of Parliament for Manchester Withington from 1923 to 1924 and from 1929 to 1931. Appointed a Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health in August 1931, to remain in office he contested Penryn and Falmouth (he had previously decided not to contest the Withington seat again) in October 1931, however he was unsuccessful. He was knighted in 1932. After the Second World War he again stood for parliament, as an independent candidate for the Combined English Universities seat during the 1946 by- election. He was unsuccessful and later that year joined the Labour Party. In 1947 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Simon of Wythenshawe, of Didsbury in the City of Manchester, and he was appointed chairman of the BBC Board of Governors, a post which he held until 1952. He was close friends with Sidney and Beatrice Webb, and he contributed £1000 towards their establishment of the New Statesman political newspaper in 1913. He also had long association with the Victoria University of Manchester; except for a short period, he was a member of the court and council from 1915 until his death, and he served as chairman of the Council between 1941 and 1957. Simon died on 3 October 1960 in Withington, Manchester, after suffering a stroke whilst on holiday. His eldest son Roger succeeded to the barony.

It is an oil on canvas and measures 84.8 in x 56 in (215.3 cm x 142.2 cm). Description The painting shows three dancers, the one on the right being barely visible. A macabre dance takes place, with the dancer on the left having her head bent at a near- impossible angle. The dancer on the right is usually interpreted as being Ramon Pichot, a friend of Picasso who died during the painting of Three Dancers. (Some critics believe it could well be Picasso's wife Olga Khokhlova.) The one on the left is claimed to be Pichot’s wife Germaine Gargallo with the one in the centre being Gargallo’s boyfriend Carlos Casagemas, also Picasso’s friend. Casagemas shot himself after failing to shoot Gargallo, twenty-five years before Pichot’s death, and the loss of two of his best friends spurred Picasso to paint this chilling depiction of the love triangle. Background Picasso painted The Three Dancers in Paris after a trip to Monte Carlo with his wife, ballet dancer Olga Khokhlova. At this time, Picasso was attracted to André Breton's Surrealism movement. In 1926 the painting appeared in Breton's work Le surréalisme et la peinture (Surrealism and Painting). Others link Three Dancers to Picasso's failing marriage to Khokhlova. Its caption at the Tate Gallery gives some insight into the background of the painting: It is owned by the Tate Gallery, London, having been purchased by it in 1965, and is currently on display as part of the Tate Modern's 'Poetry and Dream' exhibition. The purchase was facilitated by Picasso's friendship with Roland Penrose who was a trustee of the Tate at that time. Related Works Composer and ukulele player Ryan Choi's debut album Three Dancers was named after the painting. References  Notes  # Picasso called it Les Trois Danseuses (French) despite being a Spanish citizen, and the painting is occasionally called this, the original title (see ), as well as its English translation.

Cundy’s Harbor  On May 5, 1971, Scottie Dunning discovered a tiny male harbor seal pup on the shore of Cundy’s Harbor, Maine. After a failed attempt at locating the pup’s mother, Dunning called his brother-in-law George Swallow for help. When Swallow arrived, the two searched for the mother seal and later found her dead among the rocks. After careful consideration, Swallow finally decided to take the seal pup home with him. At first, it refused to drink milk from a bottle, but once advice was given by a neighbor to grind up fish and offer it to the pup, he sucked it up like a hoover (vacuum cleaner), hence his name. The Swallows kept him in their bathtub, but this proved too inconvenient within a few days. So George moved him out back to a spring-fed pond where he set up a “pup tent” enclosed by a wire fence. Hoover lived very much like a family dog and even accompanied George riding into town with his head poking out of the window. As Hoover grew, so did his appetite, and the Swallows found themselves contracting a firm in Portland, Maine, to supply them with enough fish. The Swallows spoke to the seal pup constantly. Alice Swallow recalls in her book, Hoover the Seal and George: “If George was late in giving Hoover his breakfast [he] found his way up to the back steps … George would yell, “Hello, there.” George and Hoover were great friends. Sometimes Hoover would hide … and would not appear until George yelled, “Get out of there and come over here!” Then Hoover would come out of hiding and rush over to George and greet him with a wet, fishy kiss.” It was during this time that Hoover began to mimic George’s thick, gruff accent and catchphrases. Soon, however, the Swallows reluctantly decided they could not keep Hoover, due to his increasing growth and enormous fish intake. In August, they contacted the New England Aquarium, who agreed to accept Hoover at their facility.  New England Aquarium  Upon their arrival, George informed the Aquarium staff that Hoover could talk, but none of the attendants believed him so he did not press the point. It wasn’t until 5 years later, as an adult seal, that Hoover became comfortable with his surroundings at the Aquarium and began to utter phrases such as: “Hello, there!” and “Come Over Here!” in a thick New England accent similar to Swallow’s. On account of this unique feature, Hoover became famous and appeared along with the Swallows in publications such as Reader’s Digest and The New Yorker and the television program Good Morning, America.  Death  Hoover died on July 25, 1985, due to complications during his annual molt. His obituary was published in The Boston Globe.  Legacy  None of Hoover's six pups (daughters Joey, Amelia, and Trumpet and sons Lucifer, Cinder, and Spark) spoke, but his grandson Chacoda (or \\"Chucky\\") has shown an ability to be guided in his vocalizations. As of 2007, Chucky remains vocal but has not shown an ability to mimic human speech. Aquarium staff continue to work with him. In popular culture On the British comedy panel game show QI (Quite Interesting), host Stephen Fry asked the question: “What is meant by the expression \\"Hoover the talking seal”?” Panelist Roger McGough answered, “Well, it's either one of those wonderful Oz expressions for throwing up: Excuse me, I've got to go hoover the talking seal”; to which Fry replied: “...or my wife came in just as I was hoovering the talking seal.” In 2013, Derek Kaloust and Anna Tillett wrote a children’s book about Hoover and the Swallows entitled Hoover the Talking Seal.

Course The river rises in the extensive marsh land stretching from the southern extremities of the city towards Tramore. It is first discernible in the environs of the Pitch & Putt course on the Tramore Road, between the course and the Regional Sports Centre. Another large stream passes between the course and Ursuline court, along which stretch is a pedestrian walkway. This stream joins the main river in the apex between the Inner Ring Road and the Tramore Road, behind the Westgate Retail Park. Before reaching this point, the main river weaves its way through the commercial area between the Inner Ring, Tramore and Cork roads. From the confluence of the main streams, the river passes, largely unseen, for a stretch behind the Tramore Road Business Park until it is fed by another stream at the Gaelic Park. From here it begins to snake, first under Bath St. in Poleberry, past the Bohemians club sports ground, and under a bridge in the vicinity of Tesco Supermarket. It then runs the length of the Railway Square complex, with Miller's Marsh to the right, before turning and moving under John's Bridge, and on to the Waterside. By this point the river has become considerable, and requires non-trivial bridging. It is also tidal from at least this point. The Waterside portion of the river is most picturesque, being flanked on its left by a quiet and leafy street. Along this section, it is spanned by a pedestrian footbridge leading to the old, long closed gas works, the bridge having fallen into quaint disrepair. The river then passes under Hardy's bridge, and assumes a melancholy character as it meanders between the People's Park and the city court house. This area is a very leafy and picturesque quarter of old Waterford city. Along this section it is spanned by a beautiful painted iron footbridge, linking the grounds of the court house to the park. Ultimately, the river moves under an unnamed bridge at Lombard St., before broadening out between Scotch and Adelphi quays, where small boats are moored. This area is quiet and tranquil, having been rejuvenated as a residential area and public amenity in the past 15 years, but it retains its very definite, old maritime feel. This section of the river is spanned by a footbridge between Scotch and Adelphi quays, below which it joins the River Suir. History Historically, the rough area between the quays, the People's Park, Catherine St. and The Mall was marshland, which gave way to what was known as The Pill. The Pill was a pool of water, fed by John's River. It was drained, along with the surrounding marshland, in the late 18th century by the Wide Streets Commission, in order to build the Mall, and to expand the city eastwards. From this point on, the river had well defined banks all the way to the Suir. Pollution The river was described as \\"seriously polluted along most of its length\\" in a 2011 report.https://www.epa.ie/pubs/reports/water/waterqua/integwaterqual/00389_EPA_IWQRSE11_WaterfordCityandCounty.pdf See also *List of rivers of Ireland References Geography of Waterford (city) Rivers of County Waterford ","title":"John's River"},{"id":"6396572","text":"TrueHoop is a digital media company co-founded by Henry Abbott, a digital sports media executive and journalist, and Judy Goodwin, an attorney and entrepreneur.

Solidification of a binary Cu Zn alloy, lever rule, with composition of 30% of Zinc in weight, using open version of Computherm Pandat. Solidification -using the Scheil rule - of a binary Cu Zn alloy, at composition Zn in weight 30% using free version of Computherm Pandat software Solidification of a binary Cu Zn alloy, with composition of 30% of Zinc in weight, using open version of Computherm Pandat. Red line is following lever rule, while Scheil model applies to the blue one  Assumptions  Four key assumptions in Scheil analysis enable determination of phases present in a cast part. These assumptions are: # No diffusion occurs in solid phases once they are formed (\\\\ D_S = 0 ) # Infinitely fast diffusion occurs in the liquid at all temperatures by virtue of a high diffusion coefficient, thermal convection, Marangoni convection, etc. (\\\\ D_L = \\\\infty) # Equilibrium exists at the solid-liquid interface, and so compositions from the phase diagram are valid # Solidus and liquidus are straight segments The fourth condition (straight solidus/liquidus segments) may be relaxed when numerical techniques are used, such as those used in CALPHAD software packages, though these calculations rely on calculated equilibrium phase diagrams. Calculated diagrams may include odd artifacts (i.e. retrograde solubility) that influence Scheil calculations.  Derivation  Image:Scheil solidification.svg The hatched areas in the figure represent the amount of solute in the solid and liquid. Considering that the total amount of solute in the system must be conserved, the areas are set equal as follows: :(C_L-C_S) \\\\ df_S = (f_L) \\\\ dC_L. Since the partition coefficient (related to solute distribution) is :k = \\\\frac{C_S}{C_L} (determined from the phase diagram) and mass must be conserved :\\\\ f_S + f_L = 1 the mass balance may be rewritten as :C_L(1-k) \\\\ df_S = (1-f_S) \\\\ dC_L. Using the boundary condition :\\\\ C_L = C_o at \\\\ f_S = 0 the following integration may be performed: :\\\\displaystyle\\\\int^{f_S}_0 \\\\frac{df_S}{1-f_S} = \\\\frac{1}{1-k} \\\\displaystyle\\\\int^{C_L}_{C_o} \\\\frac{dC_L}{C_L}. Integrating results in the Scheil-Gulliver equation for composition of the liquid during solidification: :\\\\ C_L = C_o(f_L)^{k - 1} or for the composition of the solid: :\\\\ C_S = kC_o(1-f_S)^{k - 1}.  Applications of the Scheil equation: Calphad Tools for the Metallurgy of Solidification  Nowadays, several Calphad softwares are available - in a framework of computational thermodynamics - to simulate solidification in systems with more than two components; these have recently been defined as Calphad Tools for the Metallurgy of Solidification. In recent years, Calphad-based methodologies have reached maturity in several important fields of metallurgy, and especially in solidification-related processes such as semi-solid casting, 3d printing, and welding, to name a few. While there are important studies devoted to the progress of Calphad methodology, there is still space for a systematization of the field, which proceeds from the ability of most Calphad-based software to simulate solidification curves and includes both fundamental and applied studies on solidification, to be substantially appreciated by a wider community than today. The three applied fields mentioned above could be widened by specific successful examples of simple modeling related to the topic of this issue, with the aim of widening the application of simple and effective tools related to Calphad and Metallurgy. See also \\"Calphad Tools for the Metallurgy of Solidification\\" in an ongoing issue of an Open Journal. https://www.mdpi.com/journal/metals/special_issues/Calphad_Solidification Given a specific chemical composition, using a software for computational thermodynamics - which might be open or commercial - the calculation of the Scheil curve is possible if a thermodynamic database is available. A good point in favour of some specific commercial softwares is that the install is easy indeed and you can use it on a windows based system - for instance with students or for self training. One should get some open, chiefly binary, databases (extension *.tdb), one could find - after registering - at Computational Phase Diagram Database (CPDDB) of the National Institute for Materials Science of Japan, NIMS https://cpddb.nims.go.jp/index_en.html. They are available - for free - and the collection is rather complete; in fact currently 507 binary systems are available in the thermodynamic data base (tdb) format. Some wider and more specific alloy systems partly open - with tdb compatible format - are available with minor corrections for Pandat use at Matcalc https://www.matcalc.at/index.php/databases/open-databases. Different levels of solid fractions ( in red ) in the phase diagram of Copper and Zinc. Levels are from solid fraction fs=0.8 in steps down to 0.2  Numerical expression and numerical derivative of the Scheil curve: application to grain size on solidification and semi-solid processing  A key concept that might be used for applications is the (numerical) derivative of the solid fraction fs with temperature. A numerical example using a copper zinc alloy at composition Zn 30% in weight is proposed as an example here using the opposite sign for using both temperature and its derivative in the same graph. Scheil solidification of a copper zinc alloy, temperature in blue, numerical derivative of temperature with the opposite of solid fraction is red Kozlov and Schmid-Fetzer have calculated numerically the derivative of the Scheil curve in an open paper https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/27/1/012001 and applied it to the growth restriction factor Q in Al-Si-Mg-Cu alloys. Q=(∂(T)/∂fs)fs→0 This - Calphad calculated value of numerical derivative - Q has some interesting applications in the field of metal solidification. In fact, Q reflects the phase diagram of the alloy system and its reciprocal has been found to have a relationship with grain size d on solidification, which empirically has been found in some cases to be linear: d=a+b/Q where a and b are constants, as illustrated with some examples from the literature for Mg and Al alloys. Before Calphad use, Q values were calculated from the conventional relationship: Q=mc0(k−1) where m is the slope of the liquidus, c0 is the solute concentration, and k is the equilibrium distribution coefficient. More recently some other possible correlation of Q with grain size d have been found, for instance: d=B/(Q)1/3 where B is a constant independent of alloy composition  References  *Gulliver, G.H., J.

He played for AGOVV Apeldoorn in his native country for a few years before moving to NAC Breda. It was here that he caught the attention of then Newcastle United manager Ruud Gullit, who signed him for an undisclosed fee (thought to be in the region of £800,000) in August 1999. His time at Newcastle was largely unsuccessful, as he endured a terrible start to his career at the club, losing 4-2 to Southampton on his debut. He found his first team opportunities very limited after this, not helped by the competition for his position being very high with the reliable Shay Given and Steve Harper also at the club. Tony Caig was also ahead of him as third choice backup. He did, however, manage to keep a clean sheet against Arsenal at Highbury, in what proved to be his third and final game for the club. A proposed move to Turkey broke down in 2000, but a year later a move back to the Netherlands seemed likely, with Feyenoord rumoured to be interested. No move materialised and the former Dutch Under-21 international had no choice but to stay in the Newcastle reserves. He retired in 2004 after one final season at AGOVV Apeldoorn. In 2006, he became interim manager of NAC and led the team successfully through the relegation play-offs. Karelse became manager of NAC in 2011.

It became a primary installation on 1 March 1961. operated since its activation by the United States Air Force Security Service (USAFSS). 1964 - High frequency monitoring array In 1964, a HF monitoring/receiving system of a large circular antenna array for COMINT purposes was installed. This AN/FLR-9 receiving system was operational until October 1994. 1979 - 6917th Electronic Security Group On 1 October 1979, the base reverted to HQ Sixteenth AF (USAFE), hosting the 6917th Electronic Security Group and other assigned U.S. and Allied units and organizations. 1990 - Air Force Space Command establishes tenant unit In 1990, Air Force Space Command established a tenant unit at San Vito Air Station. Detachment 1, 73rd Space Surveillance Group was a deep space surveillance mission whose job was to search for earth- orbiting objects, generate positional (Element Set) data to identify the objects location in space, and provide that data to the Cheyenne Mountain Space Surveillance Center located in Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado Springs, Colorado. The detachment consisted of a Transportable Optical System (TOS) and a large signal detection dish antenna. The TOS, developed by Sandia National Laboratories, was a high resolution telescope used to detect visible light reflected off orbiting objects, while the large receiver dish passively received transmission signals from orbiting satellites. These two operations together were called the Combined Radio Frequency/Optical Space Surveillance (CROSS) system. 1990 - Finding a satellite December 1990 was an important time in the history of the TOS. The Galileo probe (launched October 1989) was scheduled for a flyby of Earth before proceeding with its mission, but NASA was having trouble acquiring the satellite to verify/correct its position. Failure to command the satellite and/or confirm its current/planned flight path could cause mission failure. In an effort to find the probe, NASA sent out a call for help to United States Space Command, asking the military to use its space surveillance network to try to find the satellite. Once found, NASA could point their commanding antennas to the proper location and reacquire the satellite to ensure successful mission continuation. Communication from Space Command to its subordinate units requested support from any sensors in the network that could potentially track the probe. Though the TOS system was not considered \\"operational\\" yet, the telescope and its operating system were sufficiently matured to track space objects and provide Element Set data to the space surveillance network if requested. The system had a unique function of allowing its operators to develop custom search patterns with the telescope. As Galileo was \\"lost\\", and current positional data was unavailable, a special search would be necessary to see if the probe could be found. One of the detachments members volunteered to attempt to find the satellite via one of these custom searches. The search pattern successfully acquired the satellite, and TOS was the first space surveillance system to provide the positional data to Space Command for relay to NASA, who reacquired the probe. 1994 - Mission withdrawn In 1994, the base's mission was withdrawn, however, it reopened later that decade to support NATO operations in the Bosnian War followed shortly thereafter by operations in the Kosovo War. In 2000, the facility was once again closed. The landmark FLR-9 antenna array was disassembled. In 2003, the base reverted to Italian government ownership. The remaining parts of the base (around 80%) were left unoccupied and abandoned. A proposal for reuse by the University of Salento for its university campus has not been executed. Since then, the Italian government donated parts of the base to the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) which, since 2000, managed the United Nations Humanitarian Response Depot (UNHRD) in the military section of Brindisi Airport. In December 2006, UNHRD began using the facility as a simulation-based training center for its logistics officers, as well as logistics personnel of other humanitarian organizations. As of 2013, UNHRD also expanded its warehouses and premises in this facility in addition to its original assets in Brindisi Military Airport. The 6917th Electronic Security Group and 7275 Air Base Group were stationed on San Vito. The US Navy also played a large part in the interception and decoding of intelligence and High Frequency Directional Finding.

The Jimmy Fund is an official charity of the Boston Red Sox, the Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association, the Pan-Mass Challenge, and the Variety Children's Charity of New England. Since 1948, millions of people have generously given money to help the Jimmy Fund save countless lives and reduce the burden of cancer for patients and families worldwide. The Jimmy Fund fundraising events include Jimmy Fund Golf, the nation’s oldest and largest charity golf program, and the Boston Marathon Jimmy Fund Walk, which raises the most money of any single-day walk in the country. History Dr. Sidney Farber created the Jimmy Fund to raise money to support Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, the cancer hospital he founded in Boston in 1947. On May 22, 1948, “Jimmy,” one of Dr. Farber’s young cancer patients, inspired a movement on Truth or Consequences, a national radio program. Jimmy was a pseudo name to protect his identity—his real name was Einar Gustafson. Jimmy was visited in the hospital by star players from the Boston Braves. When asked what he wanted most, Jimmy said he wanted a TV so all the kids in the cancer ward could watch his heroes play baseball. Listeners were moved to act when asked to send in money to buy Jimmy a TV. More than $200,000 was raised for the Jimmy Fund that year. The Jimmy Fund’s baseball origins later evolved into a longstanding partnership with the Boston Red Sox after the Braves moved to Milwaukee in 1953. This is the oldest and among the most successful charity relationship in all of professional sports. The radio show's host Ralph Edwards and Einar Gustafson had a reunion at Fenway Park 50 years later in 1998.Boston Braves team ownership history, SABR (Society for American Baseball Research), Bob LeMoine.

For example, a part of the human microbiota, such as the skin flora, gut flora, or vaginal flora, can become deranged, with normally dominating species underrepresented and normally outcompeted or contained species increasing to fill the void. Dysbiosis is most commonly reported as a condition in the gastrointestinal tract, particularly during small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) or small intestinal fungal overgrowth (SIFO). Typical microbial colonies found on or in the body are normally benign or beneficial. These beneficial and appropriately sized microbial colonies carry out a series of helpful and necessary functions, such as aiding in digestion. They also help protect the body from the penetration of pathogenic microbes. These beneficial microbial colonies compete with each other for space and resources.  Causes  Dysbiosis may be caused by such diverse things as antibiotic or mold exposure, alcohol misuse, or inappropriate diet.  Effects  When this balance is disturbed, these colonies exhibit a decreased ability to check each other's growth, which can then lead to overgrowth of one or more of the disturbed colonies which may further damage some of the other smaller beneficial ones in a vicious cycle. As more beneficial colonies are damaged, making the imbalance more pronounced, more overgrowth issues occur because the damaged colonies are less able to check the growth of the overgrowing ones. If this goes unchecked long enough, a pervasive and chronic imbalance between colonies will set in, which ultimately minimizes the beneficial nature of these colonies as a whole. Microbial colonies also excrete many different types of waste byproducts. Using different waste removal mechanisms, under normal circumstances the body effectively manages these byproducts with little or no trouble. Unfortunately, oversized and inappropriately large colonies, due to their increased numbers, excrete increased amounts of these byproducts. As the amount of microbial byproducts increases, the higher waste byproducts levels can overburden the body's waste removal mechanisms. It is the combination of these two negative outcomes that causes many of the negative health symptoms observed when dysbiosis is present.  Associated illnesses  Disruptions in the microbiome can allow outside factors or even pathogenic members of the microbiome to take hold in the gut environment. Dysbiosis has been reported to be associated with illnesses, such as multiple chemical sensitivity, periodontal disease, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, obesity, cancer, bacterial vaginosis, and colitis.  Cancer  Sustained periods of dysbiosis lead to extended amounts of stress and inflammation in the gut microbiome, which can in turn promote the production of carcinogenic metabolites.  Clostridioides difficile  C. difficile is an opportunistic bacteria that commonly infects patients following a disruption in the microbiome, such as treatment with antibiotics. Infection can lead to several different symptoms including watery diarrhea, fever, loss of appetite, nausea, and abdominal pain. Severe or chronic infections of C. difficile can lead to inflammation of the colon, a condition known as colitis.  Periodontitis  Periodontitis is an oral infection that can damage the bones supporting teeth and lead to tooth loss. One of the major risk factors for periodontitis is the disruption of the oral microbiome such that there is an accumulation of pathogenic bacteria.  Treatments   Antibiotics  Because of the complex interactions in the microbiome, not much data exists on the efficacy of using antibiotics to treat dysbiosis. However, a broad- spectrum antibiotic that has low impact on the intestinal gut microbiome called rifaximin, has been shown to be effective in improving several of the ailments associated with dysbiosis, including irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.  Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT)  FMTs use the same line of reasoning as probiotics; to recreate a healthy balance of microbiota in the microbiome by inserting beneficial microbes into the environment. FMT accomplishes this by taking a donation of fecal matter from a healthy individual, diluted, strained and introduced to a diseased patient. FMTs are currently used to treat patients with Clostridium difficile infections, who have proved resistant to other therapies.; however, this is considered an investigational therapy at present with risks that have not been fully defined. Because the process is not sterile and contaminations can pass from donor to patient, there is a push to isolate key microbiota and culture them independently.  Probiotics  The World Health Organization defines probiotics as \\"live microorganisms, which when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host\\".Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations; World Health Organization. Health and Nutritional Properties of Probiotics in Food Including Powder Milk with Live Lactic Acid Bacteria.Córdoba, Argentina: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, World Health Organization; 2001. The benefit of using probiotics to treat dysbiosis related diseases lies in its ability to treat the underlying cause of said diseases. Some benefits include their ability to suppress inflammation in the microbiome and disrupt colonization by pathogens.

History The Chotikul brothers were born in Loei Province in Northeast Thailand (Asanee: April 9, 1955, Wasan: March 25, 1957) and moved to Bangkok to study. They started out in the 1970s as a folk-rock combo called Isn't. The band name is derived from Isan, their home region in Thailand. The band participated in a folk song competition and won the award in 1974. After that they released several albums, including Sao ngam ta (Beautiful Girl) and Siam Square. Asanee, wanting to go in a more rock direction left the band, while Wasan continued for a time with Isn't. Asanee joined The Oriental Funk band of Rewat Buddhinan and later Butterfly. The brothers released their first album as Asanee–Wasan in 1986, Bah horb fang (Carry a lot of Things) with Nite Spot. They were signed to Grammy Entertainment (now GMM Grammy) and released another album, Puk-chee roy nah (Sufficiency Makeover), which included the hits \\"Nung Mit Chid Klai\\" (\\"A Close Friend\\") and \\"Kor Keui Sanya\\" (\\"Used to Promise\\"). In concerts they frequently throw autographed guitar picks into the crowd as souvenirs. They are glued onto their guitar or microphone stand ready to be handed out. When they released their sixth album, Rung gin narm (Rainbow), they decided not to have any concerts to support the album. Therefore, a guitar pick was included in each copy of Rung gin narm (though not in subsequent production runs of the album). Besides his work with his brother, Asanee Chotikul has been an influential producer for such bands as Micro and Tanate Waragulnukrao. When Thai rocker Sek Loso wanted to land a record deal, he mailed a demo tape to Asanee, who then released it on his own label, More Music, a subsidiary of GMM Grammy. Asanee–Wasan celebrated with a 20th anniversary concert on May 12–14, 2006 at Impact Arena in Muang Thong Thani. Originally, just one show had been planned, but when tickets quickly sold out, two more were added, which also sold out. The pair also played shows in Nakhon Ratchasima and in Phuket. They were backed by Fahrenheit.Phataranawik, Phatrawadee (May 12, 2006). \\"Rock unit\\", The Nation Weekend, Page 12-13 (print edition only). In 2011, they left GMM Grammy and co-found a new company, Music Union, with fellow producers Chatree Kongsuwan, Nitipong Hornak and singer/businessman Vudtinun Bhirombhakdi. Asanee and Wasan have released some singles, available via digital download, with the new company. Artists joining Music Union includes Blackhead, Jamjun Project, Nicole Theriault, etc. Wasan solo works In an Asanee–Wasan album, Wasan usually sings lead on only one or two songs. In the remaining songs, he would play guitar alongside his brother and sing backing harmonies. Nevertheless, the song Khong Derm (Still the Same), one of the duo's hits is sung by Wasan. Another hit song Nueng Mit Chit Klai was Wasan's work from his Isn't days and was rearranged for Asanee–Wasan. Wasan has some albums of his own with Isn't. Even after becoming Asanee–Wasan, he released two more solo albums, Guitar Toe in 1988 with Isn't, and Khuen Toe in 1992.

One of only seven men in the history of the English and Scottish Football Leagues to have scored 350 League goals, he began his career at Motherwell and established himself as a consistent scorer, finishing as the top goalscorer in the Scottish Football League on three occasions between 1918 and 1921. His 284 league goals remains a record at the club. In 1925, he moved to Football League First Division side Cardiff City and continued his scoring exploits, including achieving the winning goals in the 1927 FA Cup Final, in a 1–0 victory over Arsenal, and the 1927 FA Charity Shield, in a 2–1 victory over amateur side Corinthians, making Cardiff the only non-English team to have ever won the FA Cup or the FA Charity Shield. Despite his prolific scoring record, finishing his career with a goal average of 0.855 per game, he was never capped for Scotland. He finished his career with a short spell with Dundee which ended when he committed suicide on 8 January 1930 at the age of 34. Playing career Early career Renowned for his modesty and sense of fair play, Ferguson started his career with Parkhead Juniors in 1914. He appeared for the side in their victorious 1914–15 Scottish Junior Cup final. Motherwell Ferguson joined John Hunter's Motherwell for the start of the 1916–17 season, scoring both goals in the 2–2 draw with Raith Rovers on 19 August 1916. He soon established himself as a prolific goalscorer at Fir Park, becoming the top Scottish Football League goalscorer on three occasions (1917–18; 1919–20; 1920–21), scoring 111 goals in total. His 43 goals in 1921 is the second highest season total of League goals in England or Scotland before the change to the offside law in 1925. His scoring exploits attracted interest from several English clubs and, in June 1922, Manchester City submitted an offer of £3,500 which was rejected by Motherwell who valued Ferguson at £4,000. City would later return with an improved bid of £3,900 which was accepted by the Motherwell board but the transfer collapsed when Ferguson turned down the move. With Motherwell, Ferguson reached the Scottish Cup quarter-finals in 1921 and 1922, the semi-finals in 1923, losing 2–0 to Celtic, and achieved third place in the League in 1920.Hughie Ferguson, MotherWELLnet Despite his performances, the dominance of Rangers and Dunfermline Athletic player Andy Cunningham and, later, Middlesbrough's high scoring Andy Wilson meant they were picked for Scotland ahead of Ferguson. He represented the Scottish League XI three times, scoring three goals. In the summer of 1923 he was invited to be part of a squad organised by Third Lanark that toured South America;Tommy McInally: Celtic's Bad Bhoy, David Potter; Black & White Publishing, 2009; he scored eight goals in as many matches against opponents including Independiente, Peñarol and a Uruguay XI.Río de la Plata Trip of Third Lanark 1923, Pablo Ciullini, RSSSF, 19 August 2020 Cardiff City In 1925, halfway through the season and after scoring his 285th goal for Motherwell, Ferguson departed for South Wales, joining FA Cup Finalists Cardiff City for a fee of £5,000, just £1,000 less than the record transfer fee at the time. Such was his popularity at the Scottish club that the local steelworks closed for over an hour as the workers lined the streets to wave Ferguson off. In the previous few seasons, Cardiff had trawled far and wide for talented players and Ferguson was one of a list of notable Scots to wear the blue shirt; Scottish internationals Jimmy Blair and Jimmy Nelson had both appeared for the club. He a goalscoring debut for the club on 7 November 1925 in a 5–2 win over Leicester City. Ferguson's most successful moment in English football occurred when he appeared for Cardiff in the 1927 Cup Final against Arsenal. Having scored five times on the way to the final, in the 74th minute, collecting a throw from the right, Ferguson hurried a tame shot toward the Arsenal goal. Dan Lewis, the Arsenal goalkeeper, appeared to collect the ball but, under pressure from the advancing Len Davies, clumsily allowed the ball to roll through his grasp; in a desperate attempt to retrieve the ball, Lewis only succeeded in knocking the ball with his elbow into his own net.BBC Wales On Air - The 1927 FA Cup contains slow-motion replay footage of the goal Ernie Curtis, the 19‑year‑old centre-wing said of the goal: :\\"I was in line with the edge of the penalty area on the right when Hughie Ferguson hit the shot which Arsenal's goalie had crouched down for a little early. The ball spun as it travelled towards him, having taken a slight deflection so he was now slightly out of line with it. Len Davies was following the shot in and I think Dan must have had one eye on him. The result was that he didn't take it cleanly and it squirmed under him and over the line. Len jumped over him and into the net, but never actually touched it.\\"Derrick Jenkins and Ceri Stennett, Wembley 1927 Ferguson still features on the record books for Cardiff City, having scored five goals in the First Division fixture with Burnley on 1 September 1928 and his 32 goals in all competitions in the 1926–27 season stood until Robert Earnshaw overtook it in March 2003. He also scored the first goal in a 2–1 victory over the Corinthians in the 1927–28 Charity Shield and his two goals won the Welsh Cup later that same season for Cardiff against Bangor; but despite a healthy return of 77 goals during his four seasons there his days at Ninian Park were numbered due to a back injury. Dundee Ferguson returned to Scotland with Dundee in the following season for a fee of £500, but his days there were desperate; a despondent, demanding crowd seeking from the legendary goalscorer more than he could provide. He scored two goals for Dundee, before being dropped due to injury and a lack of form. His final game for the club was a 3–0 victory over Heart of Midlothian on 14 December 1929. Death Ferguson sank into depression and on 8 January 1930 committed suicide, gassing himself at Dens Park after a training session. He was aged 34, and left behind his wife Jessie and two children. Ferguson's family have attributed his death to an imbalance of his inner-ear which they believe was caused by an undiagnosed brain tumour. Family Ferguson's son Jack later went on to represent Britain in water polo at the 1952 and 1956 Olympics.

The synbiotic concept was first introduced as \\"mixtures of probiotics and prebiotics that beneficially affect the host by improving the survival and implantation of live microbial dietary supplements in the gastrointestinal tract, by selectively stimulating the growth and/or by activating the metabolism of one or a limited number of health-promoting bacteria, thus improving host welfare\\". As of 2018, the research on this concept is preliminary, with no high-quality evidence from clinical research that such benefits exist. Synbiotics may be complementary synbiotics, where each component is independently chosen for its potential effect on host health, or synergistic synbiotics, where the prebiotic component is chosen to support the activity of the chosen probiotic. Research is evaluating if synbiotics can be optimized, (known as 'optibiotics') which are purported to enhance the growth and health benefits of existing probiotics. Probiotics are live bacteria which are intended to colonize the large intestine, although as of 2018, there is no evidence that adding dietary bacteria to healthy people has any added effect. A prebiotic is a food or dietary supplement product that may induce the growth or activity of beneficial microorganisms. A prebiotic may be a fiber, but a fiber is not necessarily a prebiotic. Using prebiotics and probiotics in combination may be described as synbiotic, but the United Nations Food & Agriculture Organization recommends that the term \\"synbiotic\\" be used only if the net health benefit is synergistic. Synbiotic formulations in combination with pasteurized breast milk are under preliminary clinical research for their potential to ameliorate necrotizing enterocolitis in infants, although there was insufficient evidence to warrant recommending synbiotics for this use as of 2016.

Plot  Beginning around the end of the 'losing it' saga, Sparx shows up and tells Superboy of a neverending party that she herself has joined. One night she takes Superboy there by teleporting there. Superboy during this also meets Hero Cruz, and Aura, after an altercation with some of the partygoers where Superboy finds that he doesn't understand their language. Superboy thus intrigued meets Kindred Marx the proprietor of the rave called The Event Horizon who offered Superboy a handshake and after receiving a shock discovered that in the back of his right glove he now has a white rising sun symbol to which Hero Cruz replies that the mark is not on his glove but in his hand, and as long as he wishes to return to the party he can do so by touching the mark, and if he wishes to return home he only has to touch it again during the time that he is in the rave. During that time Superboy starts to enjoy himself when he is confronted by Kaliber, a juvenile delinquent from the planet Qward, who accuses Superboy of mocking Superman at which time he begins to attack him. When Marx warns them that there is to be no fighting in the Rave he then transports them to the arena where they begin to fight.

Half-Life is a 1950s teenager who was killed by an alien spaceship's wreck. Its technology somehow keeps him alive (at least halfway), with a green glowing ectoplasmic goo which takes up about half of his body, and which he can shoot at villains. He has vowed revenge for the death of his family and girlfriend (whom he later reveals was pregnant). He feels he does not fit in with the Ravers at first. Later, he wins a fancy alien motorcycle in a game of Truth or Dare, as well as becoming more a part of the group. During an altercation with some Khundians who have repeatedly violated the rules of the Event Horizon, Marx revokes their passes; when one of them says that sending them back would be like signing their death warrants, Marx shows no remorse in taking them, saying, \\"I am prepared to face the consequences of my actions, prepare to face yours\\", showing that he will take the pass from anyone that violates the rules of the Event Horizon if they cross him, even if it means that they return to their homes and face death. It is also revealed that the Event Horizon is on the run from the Darkstars. The Ravers group played vital parts in the limited series Genesis. The teleportation abilities the group were able to utilize were vital for the collected heroes of Earth.Superboy and the Ravers #14 (October 1997)Genesis #4 (October 1997) They also provided muscle during the battle against the forces of Darkseid and the simultaneous trip into the Source Wall, a battle in which Kaliber lost his vision after seeing the source directly. On a trip to Metropolis, they confront the villain Metallo. After his defeat, his enormous, metallic fists remained behind. The group converts them into housing for the needy. Tensions arise in the group when Sparx discovers she cannot handle Hero Cruz's homosexuality. The long- lived sentient canine Rex the Wonder Dog has made several appearances in the book, associated with his new 'owner', Hero Cruz. Other characters in the comic include Aura, Superboy, Sparx, Kalliber, and Half-Life.

It was designed to connect the existing Route 21 freeway north of Newark with Interstate 78, U.S. Route 1-9, and Newark Airport. The state of New Jersey applied for interstate status for the route in 1970, but construction of the road remained stalled in courts throughout the 1970s. In 1973, the state of New Jersey and the Federal Highway Administration shelved plans for the route in April 1972, and in 1997, the state of New Jersey officially removed the route from its route logs. Despite its removal, vestiges of Route 75 still remain. The first example is Exit 13 on Interstate 280 eastbound in Newark. The exit is an enormous three lane ramp, while through traffic on I-280 has only two lanes. The ramp comes to a stop at a traffic light on First Street, just south of Orange Street. Also, at Exit 56 off Interstate 78, large flyover ramps meant for a freeway diverge from the roadway, but terminate at city streets. Route description The Route 75 Freeway was intended to begin at an interchange with U.S. Route 1 and U.S. Route 9 south of Newark Liberty International Airport. The route was to head to the northwest, crossing an interchange with New Jersey Route 27 (Frelinghuysen Avenue) on the southbound side. The highway would continue, crossing a southbound trumpet interchange with U.S. Route 22, before entering the massive trumpet interchange with Interstate 78. From Interstate 78, Route 75 would head northward directly, interchanging with several local streets in Newark including Runyon, Avon, Kinney and Market on the southbound side and Alpine, Waverly, Court Streets along with Central Avenue (County Route 508) on the northbound side. From Central Avenue, the new freeway would enter the large interchange with Interstate 280 and New Jersey Route 58 and follow current-day Irvine Turner Boulevard into University Heights. From Interstate 280, Route 75 was to interchange with Park Avenue heading northbound before making a bend to the northeast, where it would merge in with Route 21 (the McCarter Highway) just south of Chester Avenue (Exit 4). History Map of Orange Street and Hecker Street in Newark. Interstate 280 is the dual highway to the north, and although unmarked, this is where after a suppressed proposal, where NJ 75 was to end In 1961, the New Jersey State Highway Department announced plans to lower the existing traffic congestion through Newark with a new freeway through the center of the city. A study was almost immediately funded, named the \\"Newark Transportation Study\\", which suggested the construction of a new north-south arterial through midtown Newark. This new freeway was to connect U.S. Route 1, U.S. Route 9, Interstate 280 (co- signed New Jersey Route 58), Interstate 78 and Newark Liberty International Airport for Newark through traffic. The nearby New Jersey Route 21 (McCarter Highway) arterial was designated to handle local traffic in this situation. The new freeway was designed to handle 45,000 people in annual daily traffic by 1975. The new freeway, designated as Route 75, was to begin at an interchange with U.S. Routes 1 and 9 in the southern end of Newark (near the Airport) and continue through Midtown Newark to an interchange with Route 21 south of current-day Exit 4 (Chester Avenue), where the right-of-ways would merge in. In 1962, the State Highway Department brought up the theory of expanding the Route 75 Freeway into a larger, Interstate 95 alignment extension of the Somerset Freeway. The route was to serve as the local area with an express-local format. Under this, the express lanes would serve Interstate 95, while the local lanes would serve Route 75. However, the plan did not gain traction and the Federal Bureau of Public Roads denied Interstate 95's alignment north of Interstate 287 in Middlesex County. (The Somerset Freeway portion Interstate 95 was canceled in 1982.) To add insult to injury, the State Highway Department had to scale back plans for the Route 75 Freeway in 1967. They recommended constructing the portion between Interstate 78 and Interstate 280 first, later to become a vital artery for Essex and Passaic Counties. In 1967, the freeway was scaled back to two miles and would cost $69.7 million (1967 USD), and just two years later, this had ballooned to $115 million. Of this $115 million, a significant portion would go to condemning buildings and acquiring right-of-way. As a result, the Tri-State Transportation Commission suggested to construct only the Interstate 78-280 portion and not the extensions to Interstate 80 and the Goethals Bridge. The proposal was met with fierce opposition by residents of the Central Ward, 20,000 of whom would have been displaced. After high costs began to inhibit further progress, the Department of Transportation suspended construction of the Route 75 Freeway in 1969. Although construction was stopped, the state forwarded the proposal of getting Route 75 to become an Interstate in 1970. The expressway remained on maps through the early 1970s until the state and federal government both shelved the freeway. In 1997, the New Jersey State Legislature appealed Route 75 from state law.ROUTE NO. 75. L.1967, c. 87, s. 1, repealed 1997, c.143, s.3. Beginning in 2005, the state started construction on the University Heights Connector along the Route 75 right-of- way. As a result, the new connector used the old ramps built for Route 75 into Irvine Turner Boulevard in Newark. The project completed in 2008. Exit list The following list shows the interchanges that were to be built on NJ 75 prior to the scaling back of the project. The entire route would have been in Newark, Essex County.

This series is unique in many ways. Although Van Gogh loved to paint portraits, it was difficult for financial and other reasons for him to find models. So, finding an entire family that agreed to sit for paintings — in fact, for several sittings each — was a bounty. Joseph Roulin became a particularly good, loyal and supporting friend to Van Gogh during his stay in Arles. To represent a man he truly admired was important to him. The family, with children ranging in age from four months to seventeen years, also gave him the opportunity to produce works of individuals in several different stages of life. Rather than making photographic-like works, Van Gogh used his imagination, colours and themes artistically and creatively to evoke desired emotions from the audience. Background This series was made during one of Van Gogh's most prolific periods. The work allowed him to pull artistic learnings over the past several years towards the goal of expressing something meaningful as an artist. Van Gogh moves to Arles Van Gogh moved to Arles in southern France in 1888, where he produced some of his best work. His paintings represented different aspects of ordinary life, such as portraits of members of the Roulin family. The sunflower paintings, some of the most recognizable of Van Gogh's paintings, were created in this time. He worked continuously to keep up with his ideas for paintings. This is likely one of Van Gogh's happier periods of life. He is confident, clear-minded and seemingly content. In a letter to his brother, Theo, he wrote, \\"Painting as it is now, promises to become more subtle – more like music and less like sculpture – and above all, it promises colour.\\" As a means of explanation, Vincent explains that being like music means being comforting. Portrait Van Gogh, known for his landscapes, seemed to find painting portraits his greatest ambition. He said of portrait studies, \\"the only thing in painting that excites me to the depths of my soul, and which makes me feel the infinite more than anything else.\\" Van Gogh wrote further of the meaning he wished to evoke: \\"in a picture I want to say something comforting as music is comforting. I want to paint men and women with that something of the eternal which the halo used to symbolize, and which we seek to communicate by the actual radiance and vibration of our colouring.\\" As much as Van Gogh liked to paint portraits of people, there were few opportunities for him to pay or arrange for models for his work. He found a bounty in the work of the Roulin family, for which he made several images of each person. In exchange, Van Gogh gave the Roulins one painting for each family member. As the Roulin family was similar in size to Van Gogh's own, in his psychological approach Lubin suggested that Van Gogh may have adopted them as a substitute.Lubin, Stranger on the earth: A psychological biography of Vincent van Gogh, Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, 1972. , page 162. Van Gogh painted the family of postman Joseph Roulin in the winter of 1888, every member more than once. The family included Joseph Roulin, the postman; his wife, Augustine; and their three children. Van Gogh described the family as \\"really French, even if they look like Russians.\\" Over the course of just a few weeks, he painted Augustine and the children several times. The reason for multiple works was partly so that the Roulins could have a painting of each family member, so that with these pictures and others, their bedroom became a virtual \\"museum of modern art.\\" The family's consent to modeling for van Gogh also gave him the opportunity to create more portraits, which was both meaningful and inspirational to van Gogh. Van Gogh used color for dramatic effect. Each family member's clothes are done in bold primary colours and van Gogh used contrasting colours in the background to intensify the impact of the work. Joseph Joseph Roulin was born on 4 April 1841 in Lambesc. His wife, née Augustine-Alix Pellicot, was also from Lambesc; they married 31 August 1868. Joseph, 47 years of age at the time of these paintings, was ten years his wife's senior. Theirs was a working class household. Joseph worked at the railroad station as an entreposeur des postes. Van Gogh and Joseph Roulin met and became good friends and drinking companions. Van Gogh compared Roulin to Socrates on many occasions; while Roulin was not the most attractive man, van Gogh found him to be \\"such a good soul and so wise and so full of feeling and so trustful.\\" Strictly by appearance, Roulin reminded van Gogh of Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky – the same broad forehead, broad nose, and shape of the beard. Roulin saw van Gogh through the good and the most difficult times, corresponding with his brother, Theo following his rift with Gauguin and being at his side during and following the hospital stay in Arles. In the very first days of December 1888 Vincent told his brother Theo: The size given (Toile de 15, c. 65 x 54 cm), the complete set can be identified: Augustine Augustine Roulin (née Augustine-Alix Pellicot) was born on 9 October 1851 in Lambesc and died on 5 April 1930. After her husband had posed for several works with van Gogh, Augustine sat for Van Gogh and Paul Gauguin in the Yellow House the two men shared. During the sitting, she kept her gaze on Gauguin, possibly for reassurance because, according to her daughter, she was not comfortable in the presence of van Gogh. She sat in the corner of the room for the evening sitting. The resulting paintings were quite different, as was typical of the sessions where the artists shared the same model. Gauguin's portrait included as background a picture he recently completed entitled Blue Trees. He painted Augustine in straightforward, literal way. In comparison, Van Gogh's work appeared more quickly executed and more thickly painted than that of Gauguin's painting. Van Gogh admired the work of Dutch master Frans Hals whose portraits display lively brushwork and the direct, spontaneous style of alla prima, or wet-on-wet . The yellow brushstrokes on the side of her head depict the gaslight. Instead of depicting the evening mood, he painted pots of sprouting bulbs. Van Gogh made a connection to her earthy nature by the depiction of germinating bulbs, essentially declaring her a \\"human tuber.\\" Days after working on this painting Van Gogh began painting the remaining Roulin family members, including the four-month-old baby, Marcelle. In addition to the mother-daughter works where Marcelle is visible, Van Gogh also created several La Berceuse works where Augustine rocked her unseen cradle by a string. Van Gogh labeled the group of work La Berceuse meaning \\"our lullaby or the woman rocking the cradle.\\" The colour and setting were intended to set the scene of a lullaby, meant to give comfort to \\"lonely souls.\\" Van Gogh imagined the painting in several types of settings, such as on an Icelandic fishing boat cabin walls—or the center piece to two Sunflower paintings. There is a fifth version of the painting at the Art Institute of Chicago. Armand Armand Roulin, the eldest son, was born on 5 May 1871 in Lambesc, and died on 14 November 1945. He was 17 years of age when portrayed by Van Gogh.Letters of Joseph Roulin to Vincent van Gogh, 22 May and 24 October 1889; see Van Crimpen, Han & Berends-Alberts, Monique: De brieven van Vincent van Gogh, SDU Uitgeverij, The Hague 1990, pp. 1878–79 (No. 779); 1957–58 (Nr. 816) – both letters, written in French, are hitherto only published in Dutch translation. Van Gogh's works depict a serious young man who at the time the paintings were made had left his parents' home, working as a blacksmith's apprentice. The Museum Folkwang work depicts Armand in what are likely his best clothes: an elegant fedora, vivid yellow coat, black waistcoat and tie. Armand's manner seems a bit sad, or perhaps bored by sitting. His figure fills the picture plane giving the impression that he is a confident, masculine young man. The second work, with his body slightly turned aside and his eyes looking down, appears to be a sad young man. Even the angle of the hat seems to indicate sadness. Both museum paintings were made on large canvas, 65 x 54 cm. Loving Vincent, a movie based on the life of Vincent van Gogh, features Armand Roulin as the main character. In it, Roulin's asked by his father, Joseph, to deliver a letter to Vincent's brother, Theo van Gogh. The critically acclaimed film employed oil painters trained to paint like van Gogh. Their paintings were used in each frame of the movie, using stills of van Gogh's real paintings and basing Armand Roulin's character design on another of van Gogh's paintings. Many of van Gogh's portraits, like Portrait of Armand Roulin (1888), provided designs for the movie's characters. Camille Camille Roulin, the middle child, was born in Lambesc in southern France, on 10 July 1877, and died on 4 June 1922. When his portrait was painted, Camille was eleven years of age. The Van Gogh Museum painting shows Camille's head and shoulders. Yellow brush strokes behind him are evocative of the sun. A very similar painting resides at the Philadelphia Museum of Art (F537). In The Schoolboy with Uniform Cap Camille seems to be staring off in space. His arm is over the back of a chair, mouth gaped open, possibly lost in thought. This was the larger of the two works made of Camille. Marcelle Marcelle Roulin, the youngest child (31 July 1888 – 22 February 1980) was four months old, when Van Gogh made her portraits. She was painted three times by herself and twice on her mother’s lap. The three works show the same head and shoulders image of Marcelle with her chubby cheeks and arms against a green background. When Johanna van Gogh, pregnant at the time, saw the painting, she wrote: \\"I like to imagine that ours will be just as strong, just as beautiful – and that his uncle will one day paint his portrait!\\" A version titled Roulin's Baby resides at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. In Philadelphia Museum of Art's Portrait of Madame Augustine Roulin and Baby Marcelle Augustine holds baby Marcelle who was born in July, 1888. The mother, relaxed and her face in a shadow, is passive. We can see by the size of Augustine's sloping shoulders, arm, and hands that she worked hard to take care of her family. For instance, there were no modern conveniences like washing machines. In a traditional pose of mothers and new babies, Augustine is holding her baby upright, supporting the baby's back by her right arm and steadying the baby's midsection with her left hand. Marcelle, whose face is directed outward, is more active and engages the audience. Van Gogh used heavy outlines in blue around the images of mother and baby. To symbolize the closeness of mother and baby, he used adjacent colours of the colour wheel, green, blue and yellow in this work. The vibrant yellow background creates a warm glow around mother and baby, like a very large halo. Of his use of colour, Van Gogh wrote: \\"instead of trying to reproduce exactly what I have before my eyes, I use colour...to express myself more forcibly.\\" The work contains varying brushstrokes, some straight, some turbulent – which allow us to see the movement of energy \\"like water in a rushing stream.\\" Émile Bernard, Van Gogh's friend, was the initial owner of this painting in its provenance.

The freeway was planned to begin at an interchange with Interstate 78 near the Holland Tunnel approach in Jersey City, northward through North Bergen on its way to Fort Lee, where the highway would interchange with Interstate 80 near the George Washington Bridge. The original plans for the Hoboken Freeway date to September 1956, when the New Jersey State Highway Department, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey came to an agreement of a freeway from Interstate 78 to the Lincoln Tunnel approach. The route's northern terminus would be near the Port Authority's piers in North Bergen. The proposal was given an attempt for interstate highway designation in 1957, which was denied by the Federal Highway Administration. The $9 million freeway proposal was advocated for several years by several agencies, and in 1966, two of these, the Regional Plan Association and the Tri-State Transportation Commission put forward an extension northward to the George Washington Bridge approach in Fort Lee. Route description The interchange of Interstate 95, U.S. Route 9W, U.S. Route 1, U.S. Route 9, New Jersey Route 4 and New Jersey Route 67 in Fort Lee. This is where Route 85 would have approximately terminated According to the New Jersey Department of Transportation in 1972, the Route 85 Freeway would have begun at an interchange with Interstate 78 (the Newark Bay Extension and the Holland Tunnel Approach) in the community of Jersey City. The route would head northward as an eight-lane freeway, changing to 10 lanes at Sip Avenue. The 10 lanes would be in an express-local format, with two local lanes serving interchanges and three express lanes for faster approaches. The route have its second interchange at the Pulaski Skyway with U.S. Routes 1 and 9 in Jersey City, where it would parallel the congested two-lane Tonnelle Avenue. The route would continue northward, paralleling the New Jersey Turnpike's eastern spur, interchanging with New Jersey Route 3 in North Bergen. Route 85 would continue northward as a 10-lane freeway to an interchange with Interstate 495 (now NJ 495), which would serve access to the Lincoln Tunnel. At the interchange with Interstate 495 in North Bergen, the freeway would shrink to two lanes in each direction, using variable medians and wide shoulders. Route 85 would continue northward through North Bergen, interchanging with 69th Street before crossing the county line into Bergen County. There, the four- lane freeway would interchange with U.S. Route 46 in the community of Ridgefield. From there, Route 85 would continue through Bergen County until interchanging with Interstate 80 at the George Washington Bridge approach in Fort Lee. There, the freeway and the Route 85 designation would terminate. History On January 20, 1956, the three major agencies in New Jersey regarding transportation, the New Jersey State Highway Department, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey reached an agreement to construct a freeway from the Holland Tunnel to the Lincoln Tunnel, which serves both states. The route, known as the Hoboken Freeway, was to start at Interstate 78 and the Newark Bay Extension of the New Jersey Turnpike northward towards the Lincoln Tunnel, where it would also serve the Port Authority's piers in the city of Hoboken. The State Highway Department also put forth a possible extension from the Port Authority docks northward to the Lincoln Tunnel. At the time, the Port Authority and the Turnpike Authority would both pay a percentage to build the highway. This was divided 60-40 with the Turnpike Authority paying the 60% and the Port Authority paying the other 40. The project according to the state agencies would relieve congestion on the New Jersey Turnpike and throughout Hoboken. The original cost to construct the freeway was situated at about $9 million (1956 USD), but would be up for future changes. The interchange between Interstate 78 and New Jersey Route 139, where Route 85 was to begin Eight months later, on September 20, 1956, it was announced that the Newark Bay Extension of the Turnpike was going to open a week from that day, and that the extension to Hoboken had ballooned to a cost of $18 million (1956 USD) for the first . This project would also tie in with the construction of a new interchange between the Turnpike and U.S. Route 1 in the general area of current-day New Jersey Route 81 in Elizabeth. A year after the project was announced, the State Highway Department decided that the route should become part of the Interstate highway system along with New Jersey Route 58 (the Essex Freeway) would receive funding to help the commercial areas of northeastern New Jersey. Using Federal Aid Improvement Route 105, which had been originally conceived for New Jersey Route 3, the Federal Highway Administration supported funding for Route 58 (which eventually became Interstate 280 upon completion), but did not support funding the Hoboken Freeway. U.S. Route 1 and 9 about to turn on to Tonnelle Avenue at the Tonnelle Circle. Route 85 was supposed to relieve congestion on Tonnelle Avenue Although the request for Interstate funding did not succeed, the authorities continued to push forward for the Hoboken Freeway throughout the next several years. During that time, the freeway received the Route 85 designation, and the Tri-State Transportation Commission (along with the New Jersey Department of Transportation) released information on the effects of building the new highway. According to the statement, the new freeway would head from the Holland Tunnel Approach in Jersey City northward to Weehawken, where it would meet Interstate 495 at the Lincoln Tunnel. The waterfront highway, as referred to, would serve the heavy industry, high-density population, and the redevelopment for the waterfront. Route 85 would also serve as a backup to Manhattan's West Side Highway (New York State Route 9A) as a controlled access distributor. This would relieve congestion on the West Side Highway and create a backup route between both tunnels. The state of New Jersey passed a bill in 1965 adding the new Route 85 Freeway to the state law. In 1966, the Tri-State Transportation Commission along with the Regional Plan Association proposed an extension further northward to the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee. The two agencies saw the proposed freeway as an integral part of starting Hudson River development of the communities in its path. The agencies also noted it was also be an important part of preserving the New Jersey Palisades, a mountain range in northern New Jersey. However, constructing this freeway was halted when problems relating to engineering such a highway, the economic cost, and environmental concerns arose. The political community also had an issue in constructing the highway, as creating a six-lane freeway through the established communities would be daunting. $3 billion (1966 USD) was allocated for the construction of the Route 85 Freeway from the Holland Tunnel to the George Washington Bridge. Local residents demanded an agency be included in the plan to preserve the Palisades and that it be done quick. The proposed price to construct the Route 85 Freeway in 1969 had ballooned from the original $18 million to $110 million (1969 USD).

He is said to have been the son of a noble family, but to have given all his wealth to the poor before moving to a miserable hut near the river. He is the patron saint of the nearby city of Alessandria, where his feast is celebrated on the Sunday following 10 November. Life He is first mentioned in the Historia Langobardorum () which was written some forty years after his death by Paul the Deacon. Baodolinus is described there as “a man of wonderful holiness…who was distinguished for many miracles”, and as having been endowed with the gifts of clairvoyance and prophecy. One specific miracle is recorded. When Liutprand is hunting in the forest near Forum, and his nephew Aufusus is accidentally injured by an arrow, the king sends to Baodolinus asking him to pray for the life of the boy. But the messenger receives the reply: > I know for what cause you are coming, but that which you have been sent to > ask cannot be done since the boy is dead. Aufusus had indeed died and Liutprand understood that Baodolinus had the spirit of prophecy. Baudolino died around 740 and was laid to rest at Forum Fulvii. Remains and legend Four centuries later, in 1168, Alessandria was founded as a bastion of the Lombard League against the Holy Roman Empire. The citizens of Forum were transferred to the new city, bringing with them the remains of the saint. In 1174, according to tradition, he appeared on the bastions of the city and put to flight the Imperial troops who were besieging the city. In 1189 a church was built in his honour under the rule of the Humiliati. These monks, and the Dominicans who succeeded them on the suppression of order of the Humiliati in 1571, elaborated the scanty accounts of Baudolino’s life and promulgated such anachronistic beliefs as that he had belonged to the order of the Humiliati and that he had been an archbishop of Alessandria. In 1786 Saint Baudolino was proclaimed the principal patron of the city and diocese of Alessandria. With the closure of the church in 1803, Baudolino's remains were transferred to the church of Sant'Alessandro and then in 1810 to a chapel dedicated to him in the new cathedral. In 2000 Umberto Eco, a native of Alessandria, published his novel Baudolino, whose eponymous twelfth-century hero meets the saint as a boy on a number of occasions \\"in the Frescheta woods there specially when there's real fog when you can't see the tip of your nose.\\" Forty years later, during his career as a stylite near Byzantium, Eco has his hero perform a miracle of clairvoyance modelled closely on that of the saint. Iconography He has been depicted dressed as a bishop, surrounded by the geese, deer and other animals which, according to his legend, enjoyed listening to the hermit - anticipating a later similar depiction of Saint Francis of Assisi.

Early career Powell was educated at Uppingham School, a boys' independent school in Rutland in the English Midlands. Powell began his broadcasting career as the first voice on air when BBC Radio Birmingham launched in 1970, and then had a brief spell on Radio 1 in 1972. He then went to Radio Luxembourg before rejoining Radio 1 in 1977. Almost immediately after his arrival at the station he made his debut as a Top of the Pops presenter, joining Radio 1 colleagues on the roster. Radio 1 career Powell began as a weekend presenter on the station, presenting a Sunday show from 10am to 1pm, before a move to Saturdays in October 1978, again from 10am to 1pm. In 1980 he took over the weekday afternoon show running from 3:30 to 5:30pm, before taking over the weekday teatime slot in 1981 from 5 to 7pm. The show went out from 4:30 to 7pm in 1982. His best remembered features are 5 45s at 5.45, where Powell played five new singles, and the Record Race, in which listeners had to identify songs purely from their intros. Every Tuesday he ran through the new singles chart which had been revealed by the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB) earlier at lunchtime on BBC Radio 1 presented by Gary Davies - the first chance many young listeners got to hear the new Top 40. He also featured the album chart on Wednesday evenings. Pete Tong - now one of Radio 1's longest-serving DJs - made his first appearance on the network on Powell's show in the early 1980s, presenting a dance music feature. Powell was an early champion of a number of successful mainstream 1980s acts, including Spandau Ballet, Culture Club and Duran Duran as well as Australian new wave band The Church. He compered Duran Duran's charity concert at Villa Park 1983 as well as the Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert 1986 three years later, which featured George Harrison.

He enrolled at rival Oregon State University in Corvallis in order to expire his collegiate eligibility and be eligible for the 1975 NFL Draft. Briefly a pro wrestler, he trained for the Superstars competition and was selected in the first round by the New England Patriots, the 16th overall pick and signed in May. NFL career New England Patriots (1975–1980) During the Patriots 30–27 win in 1976 over the two- time defending champion Pittsburgh Steelers on September 26, Francis caught a 38-yard touchdown pass from Steve Grogan on fourth and one. In that same game, Francis had a career-best 139 yards receiving. As a result, Howard Cosell proclaimed him as the \\"All-World Tight End.\\" In 1980, Francis caught a 23-yard pass from Harold Jackson, on a wide receiver reverse option play, in the Patriots win over the New York Jets on November 2. He caught a 12-yard pass from WR Harold Jackson, on the same wide receiver reverse option play, in the Pats' overtime loss to the Miami Dolphins on Monday Night Football on December 8. In 1978, Francis had a career-longest 53-yard reception and 126 yards receiving in the Patriots win over the Oakland Raiders at the Oakland Coliseum on September 24. That season, he led the Patriots in receptions with 39 catches for 543 yards. Francis was a Pro Bowl selection for three consecutive seasons (1977–1979). Following the 1980 season, Francis retired from professional football. Two things that Francis has said contributed greatly to this decision were, one, when the Patriots refused to give him his promised bonus for making the Pro Bowl (because his injury from a motorcycle accident kept him out of the game); and, secondly, when his roommate, Darryl Stingley, was paralyzed by a Jack Tatum hit in August 1978, the Patriots tried to cancel Stingley's medical insurance. Francis was the first teammate at Stingley's side immediately after the hit, and he has said it was tough to play after that.starbulletin.com Francis was traded to the defending Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers for a draft pick that the Patriots used to select future Hall of Fame linebacker Andre Tippett. San Francisco 49ers (1982–1987) After leaving the Patriots, Francis got a job with ABC Sports. While in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl, Francis interviewed Bill Walsh, the 49ers head coach. Walsh told him this was the only time in his life he would be able to play football, and that he would never get these years back and should not turn his back on this chance. Francis came out of retirement, after sitting out the season, joined the 49ers and eventually won a Super Bowl ring as a member of the 1984 49ers. Francis played a key role in San Francisco's win over the Miami Dolphins in Super Bowl XIX (5 catches for 60 yards). In 1985, Francis had a career-high 44 receptions. New England Patriots (1987–1988) After being waived by the 49ers during the 1987 season, Francis signed with his old team, the Patriots, before the season's final game. His second tenure in New England was less successful than his first, however, and he played just one more season. Francis spent 1989 injured before being waived and retiring. Superstars, Professional wrestling career; retirement Francis qualified for The Superstars final and the World Superstars in 1980 and 1981, finishing second in the 1980 final and fourth in 1981. He won the football preliminary in 1981 and set a record of 23.91 seconds in the swimming event. The record stood until 1986, when it was broken by Greg Louganis. Francis appeared in a 20-man battle royal at WrestleMania 2 along with other NFL stars. He is the son of wrestling promoter Ed Francis, He briefly competed full-time in the American Wrestling Association after retiring from football. He also competed in the National Wrestling Alliance's NWA Hawaii where he held the NWA Hawaii Tag Team Championship one time with his older brother, Billy Roy Francis. After retiring, he hosted The Russ Francis Show from 8 am to noon on 107.7 WTPL \\"The Pulse\\", out of Concord, New Hampshire, and later he hosted Forever West Outdoors from 4 to 6 pm on 1400 AM KODI, out of Cody, Wyoming.

As a result, the Times has been involved in several lawsuits and controversies.

When on 28 December 1733 his father resigned as prothonotary of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, Hamilton was appointed to the office. In May 1734 James's father Andrew Hamilton sold him the town site of Lancaster, Pennsylvania for 5 shillings. Later that month, on 21 May, the younger Hamilton secured a patent from the Penn family for his grant on the Lancaster land. After the death of his father on 4 August 1741, James Hamilton inherited his 150-acre estate known as Bush Hill north of the city. He assisted his brother-in-law William Allen in the administration of lands purchased by his father to be used for the state house and surrounding public space.Browning, Charles H. (1916). \\"The State House Yard, and Who Owned It First after William Penn,\\" The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography 40(1), p. 90 Elected to the provincial assembly in 1745, Hamilton was re-elected five times. He served as mayor of Philadelphia for one year from October 1745. During his tenure as Mayor, Hamilton kept a record of servants and apprentices bound before him, which historians have used to gauge the nature and extent of indentured servitude in Philadelphia—and Pennsylvania more generally because Philadelphia was the entry-point for indentured servants coming into the colony from Europe.George W. Nieble, \\"Servants and Apprentices Bound and Assigned before James Hamilton Mayor of Philadelphia, 1745\\" The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography 30 (1906) Hamilton became a member of the provincial council in 1746. He was commissioned by the sons of William Penn as lieutenant-governor, as which he served until 1754, then again from 1759 to 1763, then briefly also in 1771 and 1773. On 13 September 1761, Hamilton and William Allen conveyed Lot no. 1 and the other pieces of property obtained by Andrew Hamilton and Allen to Isaac Norris II and the other trustees in charge of purchasing property for the Philadelphia state house. The conveyance of this land completed the area of the Yard: property that contained the state house and the public spaces surrounding it. During the period that the federal capital was located in Philadelphia, William Hamilton was on an extended stay in England. He rented Bush Hill to the government for the vice-president to use as his residence.

Their territory north of the Blue Mountains (west of the Susquehanna River) was being encroached upon by settlers illegally. Hamilton authorized Richard Peters and Conrad Weiser to assist in removing these squatters after the provision in the Land Purchase of 1749, which authorized their removal by force if necessary.Laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania: May 24, 1781-Sept. 3, 1790, Volume II, Bioren Publishing, Philadelphia (1810) Other issues faced by Hamilton were: *Encroachment of the French Military into forts in the land of the Pennsylvania Charter at Presque Isle, Venango, La Boeuf and Du Quesne. *Organizing and funding a defense (against the French) in opposition to the pacifist Quaker element in the Assembly *Friction between the Assembly and Proprietors on taxing Proprietary land holdings *Assembly discontent over the Proprietors’ refusal to hear appeals from them about the Deputy Governor's decisions *Failure to disclose to the Assembly, the Proprietors’ directive concerning the financial interest of pecuniary bills which Hamilton would approve *Albany Congress attended by John Penn and Benjamin Franklin, who proposed a colonial union for defense against the French and Indians Hamilton resigned due to his deteriorating relations with the Assembly in the attempt to follow the Proprietors’ instructions. Hamilton’s second turn as Deputy Governor followed the recall of William Denny. The French and Indian War was coming to its conclusion. However, Pennsylvania was now facing Pontiac’s War. Delaware and Shawnee raided deep into frontier Pennsylvania, taking captives and killing settlers. An uprising led by a vigilante group that came to be known as the Paxton Boys erupted in the colony. Hamilton was replaced by John Penn, William Penn’s grandson. President of Provincial Council 1771 Hamilton (in effect) assumed the role of chief executive, when John Penn left Philadelphia to return to England when his father died. The Council was prohibited to approve any act of the Assembly so the role was strictly ceremonial or administrative until October when Richard Penn, Jr., (John’s brother) was appointed Deputy Governor of the province.

It remains a beer brand in Scotland and Canada, produced under contract at other breweries in each country. History In 1830, James Maclay (1801-1875) founded the brewery as James Maclay, Ale, Porter, Table and India Beer Brewer of Alloa. James Maclay established himself as a brewer of great repute over the next 39 years and in 1870, James built the Thistle Brewery, which until 1999, was the home of the ales, which bore his name. James Maclay died in 1875, leaving his two sons James and John to run the company. The Fraser family, licensed grocers and spirit merchants from Dunfermline took over Maclay in December 1896 and in December of that year, the firm became a private limited company named Maclay & Company, Limited. Maclays ales won medals at Vienna in 1894, Newcastle in 1898 and Paris in 1900. Despite the renown of their Oat Malt Stout, the change in fashion away from dark beers led to difficulties for the company in the 1990s and brewing at the Thistle Brewery ceased in 1999. In 2001 the company ceased using the buildings as their office base. The Thistle brewery has since been demolished and replaced by retail units and flats. Only part of the brewery survives and is now a pub called The Old Brewery, owned by Belhaven. On March 10, 1994, the company changed its name to Maclay Inns Limited to better reflect its current business model. The company acquired the Clockwork Beer Company in Glasgow, which now operates as the de facto Maclays brewery under the Three Thistles PLC, brewing its own range of beers and Maclays recipes. In 2012 Tennent Caledonian acquired a substantial minority shareholding. On 23 January 2015 it was announced that the company had gone into administration after failing to find a “strategic solution to the financial pressures facing the business”. Administrators EY continue to operate the business whilst trying to find a buyer. The 15 pubs are reported to be trading profitably. In June 2015 it was reported that Stonegate Pub Company had bought the Maclays owned pubs from administration.

The downs encompass the entire southern outlook of the village of Bowerchalke in the Salisbury district of Wiltshire, England, and are adjacent to both the Hampshire and Dorset county boundaries. The Bowerchalke Downs are located within the Cranborne Chase and West Wiltshire Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and are part of the Southern England Chalk Formation.  Site of Special Scientific Interest  The English Nature citation from 1971 states that: \\"This site is an extensive area of floristically rich chalk grassland, a habitat which has become increasingly scarce due to agricultural intensification. It lies along an escarpment of the Middle Chalk overlooking the Ebble Valley in South Wiltshire and has slopes of several aspects. Present on the site are plant and animal species with a nationally restricted distribution.\\"English Nature citation \\"Most of the site comprises species- rich turf in which sheep's-fescue Festuca ovina and meadow oat-grass Avenula pratensis are major components whilst quaking-grass Briza media, salad burnet Sanguisorba minor, small scabious Scabiosa columbaria, and cowslip Primula veris are widespread and frequent.\\" \\"Several species considered indicative of continuous management in the absence of fertilisers, herbicides and ploughing also occur throughout. These include clustered bellflower Campanula glomerata, frog orchid Coeloglossum viride, chalk milkwort Polygala calcarea and betony Stachys officinalis.\\" \\"There is, however, much variety within the vegetation and several species that are generally scattered in the turf such as glaucous sedge Carex flacca, spring-sedge Carex caryophyllea, wild carrot Daucus carota and kidney vetch Anthyllis vulneraria show localised abundance.\\" \\"Over quite extensive areas dwarf sedge Carex humilis becomes dominant, a species largely restricted to the downs of south west Wiltshire and Dorset. Two other species with a localised national distribution are early gentian Gentianella anglica and musk orchid Herminium monorchis. The latter is found in an area particularly rich in orchids including pyramidal Anacamptis pyramidalis, bee Ophrys apifera, common spotted Dactylorhiza fuchsii, fragrant Gymnadenia conopsea and twayblade Listera ovata.\\" \\"Where the sward has been more lightly grazed upright brome Bromus erectus, hairy oat-grass Avenula pubescens, cock's-foot Dactylis glomerata and false oat-grass Arrhenatherum elatius become more predominant. Associated with these are herbs such as yellow rattle Rhinanthus minor, greater knapweed Centaurea scabiosa and common knapweed Centaurea nigra as well as species common to the whole site like salad burnet and cowslip. In these areas there are also colonies of meadow saxifrage Saxifraga granulata and small populations of both greater butterfly orchid Platanthera chlorantha and adder's-tongue Ophioglossum vulgatum.\\" \\"Scrub is scattered on some of the slopes becoming dense in one or two places. There is a diversity of shrub and tree species; hawthorn, blackthorn, wayfaring tree, gorse, whitebeam, hazel and ash.\\" \\"Anthills produced by the yellow meadow ant Lasius flavus are a feature of several slopes. The grassland supports a variety of butterfly species including dingy skipper, dark green fritillary and common blue. The adonis blue is also found where its larval food plant, horseshoe vetch Hippocrepis comosa grows in favourable conditions. In Britain this butterfly is confined to a limited number of chalk and limestone grassland sites in the south.\\" \\"Birds typical of this habitat include skylark, corn bunting, yellowhammer and grey partridge. Both green and great spotted woodpecker visit the site to feed and buzzard and kestrel hunt the area.\\"  References  Sources * English Nature citation sheet for the site (accessed 8 August 2006) External links * English Nature website (SSSI information) Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Wiltshire Sites of Special Scientific Interest notified in 1971 Hills of Wiltshire ","title":"Bowerchalke Downs"},{"id":"6397692","text":"Bracknell Croft () is a 4.8 hectare biological Site of Special Scientific Interest in Wiltshire, notified in 1971.

Establishment  Since the late 1990s Kremandala Ltd., already holding portions of the newspaper and radio market in Belize, applied for a television license. The feud over the license dragged on for months; established media houses claimed Krem chairman Evan X Hyde was trying to corner the media market in Belize. Eventually KREM was granted license, and test broadcasts started in 2002.  Test broadcasts  Test broadcasts were conducted in 2002 and 2003, on CBC Channel 3 in Belize City. Among the programs shown were live audio feeds of KREM FM programs, old semi-pro basketball games featuring company team the Kremandala Raiders and documentaries.  KREM TV today  KREM came on the air in September 2004, under the slogan \\"Show weself, see weself, be weself\\" (Kriol for \\"Showing Ourselves, Seeing Ourselves, Being Ourselves\\"). The slogan captures the idea of creativity and not being a slave to a certain format, something KREM has long championed. A Christmas program aired in December attracted modest viewership. In 2005, most of KREM's primetime radio programs began to be aired by television, including The Kremandala Show, Women at Work and WUB Morning Vibes. Framed around these programs were international documentaries featuring African and African-American issues and occasionally sports. In 2006, KREM added local dramatic series Noh Matta Wat!, teen show Teen Speakout and a show hosted by UDP politician and attorney Wilfred Elrington.

Store norske leksikon) Biography Tor Sørnes was born in Sola, Rogaland county, Norway as a son of inventor, radio technician and clock maker Rasmus Sørnes. Being the son of an inventor, Tor Sørnes occupied himself with technical matters already as a child. In 1950 he was employed a production planner at steel and ironware factory Christiania Staal & Jernvarefabrikk in Moss, Norway. The factory made locks and ice skates under the brand Ving. In 1955 he became the factory's machine constructor and when the factory in 1960—as one of the first in the country—established a department of research and development, he was its director. Rasmus Sørnes (Store norske leksikon) In 1975 he launched the holecard based recodable keycard lock, where each new hotel guest could have his/her own unique key formed by a pattern of 32 holes in a plastic card. The invention is still in worldwide hotel security use under the brand VingCard. The 32 holes in the key gave 4.2 billion combinations, the precise same number as the population of the earth at the time. This lock system was patented in 29 countries. In 1975 Tor Sørnes launched the first recodable cardkey lock, the VingCard, which used a holecard plastic key. He then led the development of and patented the electronic keycard lock, based on the magnetic stripe key.Tor Sørnes ( Fredrik Th. Bolin. Store norske leksikon)] Export of the system was initiated in 1978 when it was installed in Peachtree Plaza Hotel in Atlanta, Georgia, at the time the world's tallest hotel. The hotel had been troubled by burglaries and was eager to test new security innovations. In 1992–93 the electronic magnetic stripe card lock was launched and became a worldwide success. Tor Sørnes continued as a vice president and director of R&D; at VingCard until retirement in 1992. Following the merger in November 1994 between VingCard's former owners, Abloy Security, and the Swedish Securitas AB, VingCard is now part of Assa Abloy, a Swedish lock manufacturer.

Its establishment and funding was made possible by the Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS), designed to generate economic development in previously isolated areas, supplement the interstate system and provide access to areas within the region as well as to markets in the rest of the nation. Route description The Great Smoky Mountains Expressway is a section of US 74; from US 19 (Alarka Road), near Bryson City, to I-40, near Clyde. The expressway also shares concurrences with three other major highways in the region: US 19, US 23 and US 441\\\\. The Expressway is broken into five segments: three freeway segments, where all major interchanges occur with speed limit, and two expressway grade segments that links the freeway gaps along the route at speed limit. The western freeway segment begins at the US 19 (Alarka Road) interchange, south of Bryson City, and ends after the US 441 interchange, south of Cherokee. This segment serves as a bypass south of Bryson City, Ela, Whittier and Cherokee. All five exits in this segment provide direct or indirect link to nearby US 19, which is the older highway that follows more closely to the banks of the Tuckasegee River. The Expressway itself is routed along the north slopes of the Alarka Mountains and briefly through the Qualla Boundary before crossing the Tuckasegee River, at the Swain-Jackson county line. A expressway grade segment separates western and central freeway segments; curving along the north banks of the Tuckasegee River, the routes main feature is short cement median or cement wall that separate the lanes of traffic. The central freeway segment serves as a bypass north of both Dillsboro and Sylva. Routed along the south slopes of the Plott Balsams, the Expressway features the major interchange with US 23/US 441, where travelers can go south to Franklin and on to Atlanta, Georgia. A expressway grade segment separates the western and eastern freeway segments; featuring a short cement median to separate the lanes of the traffic, it crosses the Jackson- Haywood county line at Balsam Gap, where it also connects to the Blue Ridge Parkway. The eastern freeway segment begins at the US 23 Business (Balsam Road) interchange, southwest of Waynesville, and ends at the I-40 interchange, north of Clyde. This segment serves as a bypass west of Waynesville, while also serving Lake Junaluska and Clyde. Having been built in the mid-1960s, it is the oldest segment of the Expressway and features a short grassy median with guardrails separating traffic lanes. There is also a quirk where westbound travelers can utilize Exit 107 and then re-emerge back onto the Expressway at the Exit 106 on-ramps. Some travelers may see this as a short- cut and will typically drive faster exiting off and then back onto the Expressway. Traffic congestion is also more common in this segment of the Expressway. The Great Smoky Mountains Expressway also makes up part of Corridor K and Corridor A in the Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS). Corridor K connects I-75, in Cleveland, Tennessee, with US 23, in Dillsboro, North Carolina, overlapping of the Expressway. Corridor A connects I-285, in Sandy Springs, Georgia, to I-40, near Clyde, North Carolina, overlapping of the Expressway. ADHS provides additional funds, as authorized by the U.S. Congress, which has enabled the Expressway to be built and successive improvements along its route. The white-on-blue banner \\"Appalachian Highway\\" is used to mark the ADHS corridor. Truck routes The Great Smoky Mountains Expressway has two overlapping truck routes. US 19 Truck traverses the former US 19A route, between Bryson City and Lake Junaluska; signage appears only at the end points, with no reassurance signs along route. US 64 Truck overlaps between Dillsboro and Clyde; it is well signed throughout the route. Though US 441 has no truck route, commercial traffic is not allowed through the Great Smoky Mountains National Park; recommended instead to traverse east on US 74 and then west I-40 into Tennessee. History The Great Smoky Mountains Expressway through Waynesville Pre-designation The Great Smoky Mountains Expressway roughly follows the route of the historic Murphy Branch of the Western North Carolina Railroad, established in the late 19th century, now owned by the Blue Ridge Southern Railroad and the Great Smoky Mountains Railroad. In 1921, wagon roads that roughly paralleled the tracks were integrated as part of the new highway system in North Carolina; designated as NC 10, its routing through the southwestern North Carolina mountains connected it with the rest of the state, going as far east as to Beaufort. In 1927, US 19 was established along NC 10, west of Asheville; by 1934, NC 10 was eliminated from the route. In 1948, US 19 was rerouted between Ela and Lake Junaluska, via Soco Gap; its old alignment became US 19A. In 1965, Congress authorized the construction of the Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS) in the Appalachian Development Act of 1965. The ADHS was designed to generate economic development in previously isolated areas, supplement the interstate system, and provide access to areas within the region as well as to markets in the rest of the nation. US 19A benefited from the ADHS by being designated as part of Corridor K (Ela-Dillsboro) and Corridor A (Dillsboro-Clyde). The first freeway section opened in 1967, bypassing west of Waynesville and continuing northeast to I-40. The second freeway section opened in 1974, bypassing north of Dillsboro and Sylva. The third and final section of freeway opened in 1976, bypassing east of Bryson City to US 441. By 1979, the two gap sections were widened and improved to expressway grade, completing a four-lane highway from Bryson City to I-40. To make the highway more consistent, in 1982, NCDOT submitted a request to AASHTO to swap US 19 and US 19A between Bryson City and Lake Junaluska; but was later withdrawn before the vote, in thanks to opposition by businesses in the resort town of Maggie Valley, who opposed losing US 19.Doris Burrell, \\"Expressway: State Makes It Official,\\" The Mountaineer, January 20, 1984. In 1984, NCDOT made a new request to redesignate US 19A into US 19 Bypass; it was so approved. Post-designation Established on September 16, 1983, the Great Smoky Mountains Expressway was designated along US 19, US 19 Bypass and the I-40 Connector, between Alarka Road and Interstate 40. Unofficially, US 19A was still designated along most of the route between Bryson City and Lake Junaluska, despite the official redesignation; this would continue to persist till the mid-1990s. In 1986, US 74 was extended west from Asheville to Chattanooga, Tennessee, which overlapped nearly all of the Great Smoky Mountains Expressway, via US 19 and US 19 Bypass; the following year, US 19 Bypass was decommissioned in favor of US 74. In late 1997, US 74 was rerouted onto the I-40 Connector, in Clyde, clinching all of Great Smoky Mountains Expressway. Over the years, expressway sections of the Great Smoky Mountains Expressway have been improved by adding Superstreet designs, designating u-turns and eliminating traffic signal along the route.

The diarist John Evelyn described the house as built in 1654; however, Sir Edward may have substantially built upon a previously existing structure, based on eyewitness evidence after the 1868 fire. His grandson Sir Edward Baynton (1593–1657) built Spye Park House after the destruction of Bromham House in 1645 during the civil war. He was married to Stuarta, the daughter of Sir Thomas Thynne, whose brother resided at Longleat.

On his death, the Bayntun male line died out entirely.

Sir Thomas purchased the medieval house and estate of Sacombe Park in Hertfordshire in 1688. Ann Rolt, née Bayntun, had several children with her first husband, and at his death, she married in 1724 the 13th Lord Somerville and had further issue, two sons and one daughter. Ann's second son Edward Rolt, later Edward Bayntun-Rolt (d. 1800), inherited the property, and was made a baronet in 1762 (see Bayntun-Rolt baronets). He had six illegitimate children with his mistress, Mary Poynter, whom he later married secretly in 1751.

In 1864, the house was bought for £100,000 by Major J.W.G. Spicer, an army officer whose investment in a brewery had made his fortune. The Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII, had offered three times as much, but was refused by the owner John Baynton Starkey for reasons unknown and was in the family's hands for a further four generations. Spicer demolished the 17th-century house, and rebuilt 1864-1868 in red brick. It was considered an eyesore by Spicer's neighbours.

He began performing in New Orleans nightclubs, specifically the Dew Drop Inn and the Club Tijuana in the mid-1950s. He made his first recording, \\"Have Mercy\\", produced by Cosimo Matassa for Aladdin Records, in 1954. He then recorded for the Dot and Ace labels, with Ace boss Johnny Vincent apparently offering him a contract under the misapprehension that Marchan was female and releasing his record \\"Give a Helping Hand\\" under the pseudonym Bobby Fields.Biography by Jason Ankeny, Allmusic.com. Retrieved October 25, 2016 From 1957, Marchan also toured with the Clowns, the band led by Huey \\"Piano\\" Smith, sometimes performing as lead singer and bandleader in place of Smith, who reputedly would stay in New Orleans to write and record while his band played clubs and toured. The touring band included James Booker on piano.

He had a number one hit on the national R&B; chart in 1960 with \\"There's Something on Your Mind\\", a cover of a song written and first performed by Big Jay McNeely, but with Marchan adding lengthy spoken word passages. His follow-ups on Fire, however, were less commercially successful, and in 1963 he signed for Stax Records on the recommendation of Otis Redding. However, he soon moved on to the Dial label, where in 1965 he recorded his own song \\"Get Down With It\\". The song was covered by Little Richard, and then reworked in 1971 by British glam rock band Slade as \\"Get Down and Get with It\\", giving the band their first chart hit. After moving to Cameo-Parkway Records he had some success with \\"There's Something About You, Baby\\", and then his second solo R&B; chart hit in 1966 with \\"Shake Your Tambourine.\\" However, later records on various labels, including Ace, were unsuccessful, and by the early 1970s Marchan had returned to club work in New Orleans as a female impersonator and MC. He regularly performed at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. He also set up his own production company, Manicure Productions, in the 1980s.

It is a licensed-produced Soviet ZIL-157 and Hino TH-series 6x6 army truck, and looks similar to original, except that it has square fenders rather than round fenders as on the Soviet-produced ZIL-157. History Throughout the 1950s, the Soviet Army helped China to build up their heavy industries. As part of this plan, China established the First Automobile Works (FAW) in Changchun Northern China. Soon after, in July 1956, they introduced the Jiefang CA-10 4x2 army truck, a copy of the Russian or Japanese ZIS-150 Hino TH-series Models ln 1958-1959 the first 6X6 CA-30 lorries for the People's Republic of China army were introduced and made by the then called FAW Jiefang company. The FAW JIEFANG CA-30 its full name, like the Russian ZIL-157, had excellent cross-country capabilities and was available in a variety of configurations, such as cargo transport or tractor- trailer. Both the CA-10 and CA-30 were used extensively by the People's Liberation Army up until the 1990s, when they were largely phased out of service. Today, few remain in private hands. Later they specialized in off- road dump trucks and construction vehicles, most of these inspired by other Soviet designs. Iveco of Italy have since acquired the Jiefang Motor Vehicle Company. The manufacturer has since changed its name, now called FAW First Auto Works this company active since 1956. In 1973 the firm designed and produced an allnew massive 60 Ton (when empty) original dumptruck model locally called the JIEFANG CA-390 much of it was inspired by former large Russian dumptrucks such as the largest models produced by BELAZ and MOAZ of the 1970s. The then large JIEFANG CA-390 was powered with a Chinese Chingfa C2956 V12 diesel engine that produced enough power to match several other similar dumptrucks at that time and its production was targeted as a quarry and mine vehicle, these are designed to carry 105 Tonnes of material when fully loaded so it became quite popular as the largest mining dumptruck available in China during the 1970s and 1980s.

In classical antiquity, a crotalum ( krotalon). was a kind of clapper or castanet used in religious dances by groups in ancient Greece and elsewhere, including the Korybantes. The term has been erroneously supposed by some writers to be the same as the sistrum. These mistakes are refuted at length by Friedrich Adolph Lampe (1683-1729) in De cymbalis veterum.i.4, 5, 6 From the Suda and the Scholiast on Aristophanes (Nubes, 260), it appears to have been a split reed or cane, which clattered when shaken with the hand. According to Eustathius (Il. XI.160), it was made of shell and brass, as well as wood. Clement of Alexandria attributes the instruments invention to the Sicilians, and forbids the use thereof to the Christians, because of the motions and gestures accompanying the practice. Women who played on the crotalum were termed crotalistriae. Such was Virgil's Copa (2), :\\"Crispum sub crotalo docta movere latus.\\" This line alludes to the dance with crotala (similar to castanets), for which we have the additional testimony of Macrobius (Saturnalia III.14.4‑8). As the instrument made a noise somewhat like that of a crane's bill, the bird was called crotalistria, \\"player on crotala\\". Pausanias affirms by way of the epic poet Pisander of Camirus that Heracles did not kill the birds of Lake Stymphalia, but that he drove them away by playing on crotala. Based on this, the instrument must be exceedingly ancient.Pausan. Arcad. lib. viiiWilkinson, John Gardner (1878). The Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians. Vol 1. London: John Murray. p. 494. The word krotalon is often applied, by an easy metaphor, to a noisy talkative person (Aristoph. Nub. 448; Eurip. Cycl. 104).

(28 February 1906 - 22 March 1974), was an English set and costume designer and stage manager, known for his work with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. Biography Goffin was born in Plymouth, England, the son of Willam Earl Goffin and Elizabeth Goffin, née Underwood. From 1922 to 1930 he worked as an interior decorator and mural painter locally.Who's Who in the Theatre, fourteenth edition (1967), p. 655, Pitman Publishing, London As a young man, he was taken on by the local repertory theatre in Plymouth as a designer, going on to Dartington Hall from 1931-34 where he took over responsibility for staging, costumes and lighting of the Dance-Drama Group. In 1935 and 1936 he was resident director at the Barn Theatre, Chesham Bois, Buckinghamshire. In 1936, Goffin went to the Westminster Theatre in London, working with Harley Granville Barker and Michael MacOwan on a range of productions, from classics such as Volpone, Uncle Vanya and Troilus and Cressida, to modern works including Mourning Becomes Electra, Heartbreak House, and T. S. Eliot's The Family Reunion. In 1938 Goffin was invited by the government to supervise a course on stagecraft and to lecture on the subject. During his Dartington days, Goffin met Bridget D'Oyly Carte. She introduced him to her father, Rupert, who commissioned Goffin to redesign the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's production of The Yeomen of the Guard in 1938. Goffin's new set caused dissent among traditionalists because it did not depict the familiar backdrop of the White Tower. Martyn Green, the reigning principal comedian, was far from happy with his new costume, and he implied in his memoirs that it was one of the reasons why he later left the company.Martyn Green, Here’s a How-De-Do, London, Max Reinhardt, 1952 For Rupert and later Bridget D'Oyly Carte, he designed new sets and costumes for Ruddigore (1948), Patience (1957), The Mikado (1958 – sets only, most of the celebrated Charles Ricketts costumes being retained), The Gondoliers (1958), Trial by Jury (1959), H.M.S. Pinafore (1961), and Iolanthe (1961). He also created a unit set – a framework on which the sets for each opera could easily be interchanged, which, according to Frederic Lloyd, the General Manager of the D'Oyly Carte Company, \\"saved the management an enormous amount of expense and facilitated taking more operas to more theatres.\\"Goffin's obituary in The Savoyard In addition, Goffin designed a number of posters and other graphic art for the D'Oyly Carte organisation. Goffin wrote books including Stage Lighting (1938), The Realm of Art (1946), Stage Lighting For Amateurs (1947) and The art and science of stage management (1953). His The Realm of Art, and his meeting Leon MacLaren, led the School of Economic Science to begin teaching philosophy; Goffin later presented their early public philosophy lectures.. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1948. He was married to Margaret Wallace Dale. Goffin died in Buckinghamshire at the age of 68.

The four guns were mounted in two twin-gun, pear-shaped barbettes, one forward and one aft of the superstructure. The barbettes were open, without hoods or gun shields, and the guns were fully exposed. The shells fired by these guns were credited with the ability to penetrate of wrought iron at , using a charge of of smokeless brown cocoa (SBC).Parkes, pp. 316–17 At maximum elevation, the guns had a range of around with SBC; later a charge of of cordite was substituted for the SBC which extended the range to about .Campbell 1981, p. 96 There were significant delays in the production of the heavy guns for this ship and her sisters, due to cracking in the innermost layer of the guns, that significantly delayed the delivery of these ships.

They fired shells that were credited with the ability to penetrate of wrought iron at 1000 yards. They had a range of at an elevation of +15° using prismatic black powder. Beginning around 1895 all of these guns were converted into quick-firing guns (QF) with a much faster rate of fire. Using cordite extended their range to .Campbell 1983, pp. 171–72 For defence against torpedo boats the ships carried a dozen QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss guns and 10 QF 3-pdr Hotchkiss guns. They also mounted five above-water torpedo tubes, one in the bow and four on the broadside. The armour scheme of Howe and Rodney was virtually identical to that of Collingwood.

By the early 20th century, Cohasset was famous for its high quality apples. Today, they are better known for peaceful country living, the Annual Cohasset Bazaar, and the beauty of the Cohasset Ridge. A post office operated at Cohasset from 1888 to 1920. The early lumbermen designated the ridge after the pineries. A school district was formed July 16, 1878 to provide a place of learning for the children of the growing number of pioneer families and was given the name of North Point District. The entire ridge came to be known by the name of North Point. In 1887 the ridge residents requested the United States Government to establish a post office there, to be named North Point. The Post Office Department concurred in the need of a postal facility but balked at the requested name. There were already too many stations in the country with either North or Point in their names so it was requested that another name be selected. For a name selecting committee two young ladies of the ridge, Miss Marie Wilson and Miss Electa Welch (the school teacher) were appointed and they chose the name Cohasset, meaning \\"City of Pines\\" in the Algonquin Indian language.

Rugby league is arguably the most similar sport to American football after Canadian football: both sports involve the concept of a limited number of downs/tackles and scoring touchdowns/tries takes clear precedence over goal-kicking. Generally, American football games last much longer than 80-minute rugby league matches. Because the field is reset after each tackle in American football, it is much slower- paced than the more hectic rugby league, in which play stops for only as long as it takes the tackled player to get back to his feet and return the ball to play. Another major difference is that only the player with possession of the ball may be interfered with in rugby league; defending players interfering with any other attacking player (and vice versa) will incur a penalty. Passing in the two sports also differs: while backward passing is common to both sports, in American football players are allowed to throw the ball forward in certain situations whereas in rugby league forward passing is always illegal. Rugby league footballers have to kick the ball or run it forward to advance it downfield. To score a try or touchdown in rugby league, the player has to push the ball directly onto the ground once in the try zone, whereas in American football the player has to simply cross the line. American football requires its players to use a large amount of protective equipment, including helmets, gloves and padding around the body, whereas protective clothing is much more minimal in rugby league, usually amounting to light padding (if any) and soft head gear (hard helmets being illegal). The playing fields of both sports are similar in size with a rugby league playing field being long while an American football field is long. Origins Both sports descend from the older game of rugby football, which originated in 19th Century England. British colonists and the British military in Canada brought football to North America. It became popular in American and Canadian universities and prep schools. At the time, association football and rugby football were not as differentiated as they are now and teams would negotiate the rules before playing each game. The sports of American football and Canadian football evolved from these intercollegiate games. Meanwhile, in England a schism developed in rugby football between those who favoured strict amateurism and those who felt that players should be compensated for time taken off work to play rugby. In 1895, this resulted in the formation of a break-away sport, rugby league, which permitted player payments. At first, the two rugby codes differed only in how they were administered; over time, their playing rules diverged to the point that they are now distinctly different forms of football. The field An American football field A rugby league field American football is played on a rectangular field long by 53 1⁄3 yards (48.8 m) wide. Near each end of the field is a goal line, which are apart. A scoring area called an end zone extends beyond each goal line. Yard lines cross the field every , two rows of hash marks run parallel to the side lines near the middle of the field. At the back of each of the end zones, there are a set of goalposts. American football goalposts were formerly H-shaped and were located on the goal line, but; in 1967, the NFL adopted the current modern offset-fork design, made from extruded steel pipes. The goalposts currently consist of two vertical posts 18.5 feet (5.6 m) apart (24 feet (7.3 m) in high school football) rising from a horizontal crossbar, which is mounted on a single central support post that raises the crossbar to a height of 10 feet (3.0 m), resulting in a two-tined fork shape. The central vertical post is offset from the crossbar toward the rear, placing it as far as possible from the field of play; it is also usually padded to minimize collision-related injuries. In 1974, in the effort to create a safer, unimpeded field of play in the end zone, calculated to produce more passing touchdowns, the NFL relocated the goalposts from the goal line to the end line. A rugby league field has very similar dimensions, being up to long and wide. Lines cross the field marking every . The goal posts are situated on the try line and are therefore separated by exactly . The area beyond each goal post, known as the in-goal area, extends for another . In rugby league, the goal posts are usually H-shaped, each post being high and apart, with the cross bar being high. American football \\"tuning fork\\" goal posts are allowed in rugby league, provided the posts and cross bar are at the required dimensions.Rugby League Laws, p. 3 The goal posts are used for other forms of point scoring in rugby league: drop goals or field goals, penalty goals and conversions. Players As four replacements in a rugby league team, with only twelve interchanges of players allowed to be made throughout the game (ten in the Australian NRL). If the interchanges are used up and a player becomes injured and cannot continue, the team simply has to play short handed. All players must attack and defend and there is no equivalent of special teams. Prior to the 1960s, and in arena football (an indoor variant of the American game) from 1988 to 2007, American football did use a one-platoon system in which most players were required to play all facets of the game, severely limiting substitution, much as rugby league (and most other sports) continue to do. Most levels of American football abolished the one-platoon system in the late 1940s and early 1950s, although college football re- implemented it for a short time in the 1950s and 1960s. Broadly speaking, offensive and defensive linemen in American football correspond to forwards in rugby league and other players are somewhat similar to backs. Basically the job of the forwards in rugby league is to get the ball over the advantage line and give the backs space and a chance to be creative and move the ball around, which will hopefully result in points. However, rugby league footballers are far less specialised than American football players. Many of the positions have similar names but in practice are very different. A fullback in American football is very different from a fullback in rugby league. However, some of the positions are fairly similar: for instance, the stand-off/five-eighth and halfback carry out a similar role to a quarterback in American football. Advancing the ball In American football, the team that's in possession of the ball (the offense) has four \\"downs\\", to advance the ball 10 yards towards the end zone. When the offense gains 10 yards, it gets another set of four downs. If the offense fails to gain 10 yards after 4 downs, it loses possession of the ball. A down ends, and the ball becomes dead, after any of the following: * The player with the ball is tackled. * A forward pass goes out of bounds or touches the ground before it is caught. This is known as an incomplete pass. The ball is returned to the original \\"line of scrimmage\\" for the next down. * The ball or the player with the ball goes out of bounds. * The player either goes or is forced out of the field (out of bounds) * The offense turns the ball over to the defense. * A team scores. This closely resembles the six-tackle rule in rugby league. Originally, tackles were unlimited in rugby league, as they are in the related sport of rugby union. As this could result in long periods with one team in possession of the ball, in 1966 the game's administrators implemented the limited tackle rule from American football. At first, the number of tackles was set at four, as in American football; it was later extended to six to give teams more time to develop attacking play. After six tackles, the team with the ball has to hand over possession to the opposing team. A key difference with American football is that there is no automatic way of earning a new set of tackles in rugby league. Each set is effectively a chance to score, with failure to do so resulting in relinquishing possession. Another major difference is that play stops briefly when the player in possession of the ball is tackled as it resumes as soon as he gets to his feet and returns the ball to play. Players can advance the ball in two ways in American football: * By running with the ball, also known as rushing. One ball-carrier can hand the ball to another; this is known as a handoff. * By passing the ball forwards to a teammate. This can only be performed once on a down, and cannot be attempted after the ball crosses the line of scrimmage. The illegal forward pass rule has changed several times, with the current NFL rule being that the passer's entire person must be beyond the line of scrimmage for a forward pass to be illegal. The passer (most often the quarterback but not always so) can therefore straddle the line of scrimmage, or even be mostly beyond it, but still legally pass the ball, regardless of where the ball is in relation to the line of scrimmage. In rugby league the ball cannot be passed forward, so players can advance the ball by either running with it, or kicking it ahead and chasing it. This concept is preserved in American football; any player may pass the ball backwards, regardless of player position and location of the field. In addition, a ball passed backwards remains live, even if not caught, so long as it remains in play, similar to rugby league. Following a down, the ball is returned to play within a restricted time limit by a \\"snap\\" in American Football. All players line up facing each other at the line of scrimmage. One offensive player, the center, then passes (or \\"snaps\\") the ball back between his legs to a teammate, usually the quarterback and play commences. In rugby league the ball is returned to play following a tackle via the \\"play the ball\\", in which the tackled player gets back to his feet and rolls the ball back to a teammate, usually the hooker. The tackled player will usually try to return to the ball to play as quickly as possible before the defensive line can re-form. Possession may change in different ways in both games:- # An automatic handover takes place when the team in possession runs out of downs / tackles. # When the ball is kicked to the opposing team. This can be done at any time but it is normal to punt on the last down / tackle. # Following an unsuccessful kick at goal. # When an opposing player intercepts a pass. # In rugby league the opposition are awarded a scrum if the player in possession drops the ball forwards or makes the ball go forwards with any part of his body other than his feet. This is called a knock-on. # When the player in possession drops the ball and it is recovered by an opposition player. This is called a fumble in American football and a knock-on in rugby league. # In rugby league if the ball goes out of play, the opposition are awarded a scrum the \\"loose head and feed\\" of the scrum. Penalties and 40/20 kicks are exceptions to this rule. # In American football possession changes hands following a successful score and the team scoring kicks off to the opposition. In contrast, in rugby league the team who conceded the points must kick off to the team who scored. (In some amateur levels of American football, and in Canadian football, the team who conceded the points has the option of kicking off to the opposition rather than receiving the kickoff, but this option is extremely rarely invoked.) # In American football, on a kickoff following a score the kicking team may try an onside kick to attempt to retain possession for themselves. The kicker either dribbles the ball forward or, more popularly, drives the ball into the ground in an attempt to make it bounce high into the air for a teammate to catch. The ball must travel 10 yards before it is touched by the kicking team, or be first touched by the receiving team. A similar tactic is used in rugby league, called a short kickoff. A high cross-field kick towards jumping receivers is popular. The kick must travel at least 10 metres forward before being caught. In both codes the tactic is most often attempted by a team that is behind late in a game, but may be tried at other times as a surprise tactic. In both codes, tactical kicking is an important aspect of play. However, kicking in general play is more common in rugby league. Kicking is far more heavily restricted in American football; the rules currently prohibit a player from kicking the ball after he has crossed the line of scrimmage, whereas a rugby league footballer can kick the ball at any time, from any point on the field. In rugby league, a player can receive a kick (and still maintain possession) if he is behind the kicker at the time of the kick; that feature is not allowed in the American game, except in the onside kick scenario described above. Passing In American football, the offense can throw the ball forward once on a play from behind the line of scrimmage. The forward pass is a distinguishing feature of American and Canadian football as it is strictly forbidden in rugby league. The ball can be thrown sideways or backwards without restriction in both games. In American football this is known as a lateral and is much less common than in rugby league. The lateral is most commonly seen on plays at the very end of the game when a team needing a touchdown with only time on the clock for one more play attempts to avoid being tackled by passing to any teammate behind him that may advance the ball. A common trick play called the hook and ladder combines the two - a short forward pass is thrown, with the player catching the pass immediately throwing a lateral to a trailing teammate who is hopefully unnoticed by defensive players. Laterals are also seen in pitch or pitchout plays, where the quarterback tosses the ball to a back behind him, rather than handing it off. There is also a minor distinction in what constitutes a forward or backward pass in the two sports. In rugby league (as in rugby union), a pass is considered forward (and thus illegal) if the person catching the ball is ahead of the player throwing it. In American football, a pass is considered forward only if the path of the ball itself has a forward component to it. For instance, the Music City Miracle (a play in which the receiving end of a lateral pass was ahead of the person throwing it, but the path was not forward) was a legal lateral in American football but would have been an illegal forward pass had it been attempted in rugby. In both codes, if the ball is caught by an opposition player this results in an interception and possession changes hands. Tackles and blocks In both games it is permitted to bring down the player in possession of the ball and prevent them making forward progress. Play then restarts from the next down or tackle. In rugby league, it is common for the player in possession to 'off-load' the ball, passing out of the tackle (before forward progress is halted) in order not to use up a tackle and to keep the play alive. This is much less common in American football, where the lateral pass is most commonly used as a desperation strategy when trailing near the end of a game. In American football, as a tactic within an offensive play, designated offensive position players are assigned to 'block' defensive players, by projecting the front of their body forward into the front or side of the defensive player, in order to impede the ability of the defensive player to tackle the ball carrier. A complicated set of rules, however well-understood by the players, coaches and officials, determines the legality of the block. Illegal blocks, when observed by the officials, are flagged for penalties that vary in their severity, depending upon the particular infraction. Blocks are not permitted in rugby league and would be considered 'obstruction', resulting in a penalty. Scoring A touchdown is the American football equivalent of rugby league's try. Despite the names, a try requires the ball to be 'touched down' to the ground, whereas a touchdown doesn't. In American football it is sufficient for the player carrying the ball to cause the ball to enter the end zone (in-goal area) while still in bounds, by carrying it in or holding the ball in or through the imaginary plane of the goal line. In rugby league the ball must be pressed to the ground in the in-goal area. An American football touchdown scores six points and a rugby league try is worth four points. In both games, following a try / touchdown, there is the opportunity to score additional points by kicking the ball between the posts and over the bar. In American football this is called an extra point or a \\"point after touchdown\\" (PAT) in the NFL (worth 1 point); in rugby league it is known as a conversion (worth 2 points). There are two key differences between an extra point and a conversion: conversions cannot be charged down like an extra point attempt and they must be taken from the same position as the try was scored. Hence, it is important to score under the posts rather than in the corner, which makes for a difficult kick. Rugby league has no equivalent to American football's two- point conversion, in which the scoring team chooses not to kick at goal, but attempt a second touchdown from short range. In American football teams often opt to attempt a field goal (worth 3 points) rather than attempt a touchdown. The rugby league equivalent, also called a field goal, is worth only one point and is much less common. The key difference between a field goal in the two sports is that an American football field goal attempt is normally kicked with a teammate holding the ball, whereas in rugby league the field goal is attempted using a drop-kick. A similar concept in rugby league is the penalty goal. Following the award of the penalty, the attacking team may opt to kick for goal rather than advance the ball by hand or punting. This scores 2 points in league. The penalty goal is similar to a field goal in American football in that the ball is kicked from the ground and may be held by a teammate (although almost never is), but it cannot be charged down. The nearest equivalent in American football is the rarely used fair catch kick. American football has one further method of scoring which does not exist in rugby league. If a ball carrier is tackled in their own endzone (in-goal area) with the ball or steps out the back of the end zone with the ball, this results in a safety which scores 2 points for the opposing team. In rugby league this does not result in any points but causes the team in possession to kick the ball back to the opposition from under the posts. Cross Code Matches At least one cross-code match between American football and rugby league has been played. On August 1, 2009 the Jacksonville Axemen of the AMNRL played the Jacksonville Knights of the Florida Football Alliance. The first half was played under American football rules, the second half was played under rugby league rules. The score at half-time was Jacksonville Axemen 6 - Jacksonville Knights 27. The final score was Jacksonville Axemen 38 - Jacksonville Knights 27.

While the New Amsterdam Musical Association has never defined itself as a Jazz-oriented organization, it has certainly been both a literal and figurative home for many jazz musicians.

It was not uncommon for the likes of John Coltrane or Max Roach to rehearse on the ground floor of the brownstone. Until the 1990s, NAMA also allowed musicians to board in the upper floors when they came to town. For a spell, Jelly Roll Morton lived in one of the upstairs rooms. NAMA moved to its current location in 1922.

In this medium, the mime must apply to physical movement those principles that are at the heart of drama: pause, hesitation, weight, resistance and surprise. Corporeal mime accentuates the vital importance of the body and physical action on stage. Étienne Decroux’s dramatic corporeal mime is taking the body as a main means of expression and the actor as a starting point for creation with the aim of “making the invisible visible” (Étienne Decroux), of allowing the actor to show thought movement.  Art of movement rather than art of silence, dramatic corporeal mime is first of all the art of the actor/actress. An actor, whatever his artistic ambition might be, must, before all, be present, “be” on stage and this presence is shown through the body. The body is what sustains the costume, what the spectator sees, what carries the voice. It is the skeleton, the hand in the glove.  It was developed primarily by Étienne Decroux, who was heavily influenced by his training with Jacques Copeau at the École du Vieux-Colombier. He created this method and technique for creative performers wishing to transform their ideas into a physical reality, in order to devise a new style of theater \\"making visible the invisible,\\" as Decroux put it. The objectives of corporeal mime are to enable the actor to become more autonomous in creating metaphor-based physical theater pieces, which may include text, but are not based on text, i.e., to give the actor greater access to physical metaphors in work in traditional plays, and to increase the actor's strength, agility, flexibility and imaginative powers. While Decroux’s movement style was quite different from the commedia dell'arte from which 19th century pantomime took as its model, Decroux was influenced by this classical art form. Decroux worked extensively with Piccolo Teatro (Milan), training actors and choreographing Arlecchino an adaptation of Goldoni's Servant of Two Masters directed by Giorgio Strehler. Coincidentally, Jacques Lecoq, another famous mime teacher worked as a movement teacher at Piccolo Teatro until he was succeeded by Decroux. Unlike classical pantomime, corporeal mime was also no longer an anecdotal art that used conventional gestures to create illusions of objects or persons. Corporeal mimes seek to express abstract and universal ideas and emotions through codified movements of the entire body (but most especially the trunk—the face and hands are confined to a secondary role in this movement form) Some corporeal mimes write their own texts, as did the Greek mime-authors, integrating the mime-actor's art with the author's. They also include props, costumes, masks, lighting effects and music. Because it contains movement expression along with other elements, it is often loosely alluded to as physical or movement theater.

In reference to aerodynamic testing, such as wind tunnel testing, water tunnel testing, or any other test investigating the flow of a fluid which may be invisible to the naked eye, seeding a flow is often the only way to take visual measurements. Simple examples of a seeded flow include the introduction of smoke into a low speed wind tunnel to see the general path of the air, or injecting colored dye into a water tunnel to see secondary flow structures such as hairpin vortices. As stated in The Handbook of Fluid Dynamics, an ideal seeding particle should have uniform properties such that its density is the same as the fluid that it's added to.

The series was created by writer Richard Regen.  Premise  Secret Agent Man starred Costas Mandylor as Monk, a gallivanting secret agent, who was one of a team of agents that included Holliday, played by Dina Meyer and Davis, played by Dondre Whitfield. The team reported to Brubeck, played by Paul Guilfoyle. The periodically appearing guest villain is the former agent Prima, played by Musetta Vander. All the lead characters share the last names of jazz musicians Thelonious Monk, Billie Holiday, Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck and Louis Prima.

It also did not have a traditional one-hour pilot filmed, and was instead ordered to series by UPN on the strength of just a presentation reel. Only 12 episodes were produced and broadcast before the series was cancelled due to poor ratings.  Theme song  The series used an updated version of the 1960s Johnny Rivers hit, \\"Secret Agent Man\\", performed by Supreme Beings of Leisure, for its theme song. Because the original version of this song was also used as the theme song for American broadcasts of another television series, the 1960s British TV series, Danger Man (primarily broadcast in the U.S. as Secret Agent), there were some mistaken impressions that this series was somehow a spin off or remake of the earlier program, but other than the theme song, no connections were made evident.

The symptoms may vary, depending on the exact location of the chromosomal deletion. The condition is caused by a genetic deletion (loss of a segment of DNA) on the outermost band on the short arm (p) of chromosome 1. It is one of the most common deletion syndromes. It is estimated that the syndrome occurs in one in every 5,000 to 10,000 births.  Signs and symptoms  There are a number of signs and symptoms characteristic of monosomy 1p36, but no one individual will display all of the possible features. In general, children will exhibit failure to thrive and global delays.  Developmental and behavioral  Most young children with 1p36 deletion syndrome have delayed development of speech and motor skills. Speech is severely affected, with many children learning only a few words or having no speech at all. Behavioral problems are also common, and include temper outbursts, banging or throwing objects, striking people, screaming episodes, and self-injurious behavior (wrist biting, head striking/banging). A significant proportion of affected people are on the autism spectrum, and many exhibit stereotypy.  Neurologic  Most people with 1p36 deletion syndrome have some structural abnormality of the brain, and approximately half have epilepsy or other seizures. Almost all children exhibit some degree of hypotonia. Common structural brain abnormalities include agenesis of the corpus callosum, cerebral cortical atrophy, gait abnormalities, and ventriculomegaly. Dysphagia, esophageal reflux, and other feeding difficulties are also common. = Vision = The most common visual abnormalities associated with 1p36 deletion syndrome include farsightedness (hypermetropia), myopia (nearsightedness), and strabismus (cross-eyes). Less common but still recognized are blepharophimosis, cataracts, ocular albinism, optic atrophy, optic disk pallor, and optic nerve coloboma.  Distinct facial features  The facial features of 1p36 deletion syndrome have been considered to be characteristic, although few patients have been diagnosed solely on the basis of facial appearance. These features may include microcephaly (small head), which may be combined with brachycephaly (short head); small, deep-set eyes; straight eyebrows; epicanthal folds; a broad, flat nose and nasal bridge; underdevelopment of the midface (midface hypoplasia); a long philtrum; pointed chin; and abnormally shaped, rotated, low-set ears. Infants may have a large anterior fontanelle, or the anterior fontanelle may close late.  Other congenital defects  = Skeletal = Short feet, brachydactyly (short fingers), and camptodactyly (permanent flexion of a finger), fifth finger clinodactyly (abnormal curvature) and other skeletal anomalies are sometimes found in conjunction with 1p36 deletion. = Heart = = Genitourinary and kidneys =  Genetics  1p36 deletion syndrome is caused by the deletion of the most distal light band of the short arm of chromosome 1. Human chromosome 1 The breakpoints for 1p36 deletion syndrome have been variable and are most commonly found from 1p36.13 to 1p36.33. 40 percent of all breakpoints occur 3 to 5 million base pairs from the telomere. The size of the deletion ranges from approximately 1.5 million base pairs to greater than 10 million. Most deletions in chromosome 1p36 are de novo mutations. 20% of patients with 1p36 deletion syndrome inherit the disease from one parent who carries a balanced or symmetrical translocation.  Diagnosis  1p36 deletion syndrome is usually suspected based on the signs and symptoms and confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Chromosomal microarray or karyotype analysis may also be used to diagnose 1p36 deletion.  Treatment  There is no cure for 1p36 deletion syndrome, and treatment is focused on relieving symptoms of the disease. Of particular importance are appropriate medication for endocrine and neurologic manifestations, such as anti-seizure medications. Feeding difficulties can be managed with specialized assistive devices or with a gastrostomy (feeding) tube.  Epidemiology  1p36 deletion syndrome is the most common terminal deletion syndrome in humans. It occurs in between 1 in 5000 and 1 in 10000 live births.

He was a younger son of Alan fitz Flaald and Avelina de Hesdin. In about 1136, Walter entered into the service of David I, King of Scotland. He became the king's dapifer or steward in about 1150, and served as such for three successive Scottish kings: David, Malcolm IV, and William I. In time, the stewardship became hereditarily-held by Walter's descendants. Walter started his career as a minor English baron. Upon arriving in Scotland, however, he received a substantial grant of lands from his Scottish sovereigns. These included the western provincial lordships of: Mearns, Strathgryfe, Renfrew and North Kyle. The caput of Walter's holdings is uncertain, although there is reason to suspect it was either Dundonald Castle or Renfrew Castle. Walter was a benefactor of several religious houses, and was the founder of Paisley Priory. There is reason to suspect that Walter took part in the Siege of Lisbon against the Moors in 1147. He probably assisted Malcolm in the series of Scottish invasions of Galloway in the 1160, which resulted in the downfall of Fergus, Lord of Galloway. In fact, Walter and the other colonial lords settled in western Scotland were probably intended to protect the Scottish realm from external threats located in regions such as Galloway and the Isles. In 1164, Somairle mac Gilla Brigte, King of the Isles invaded Scotland and was defeated near Renfrew. It is possible that the commander of the local Scottish forces was Walter himself. Walter was married to Eschina de Londres, an apparent member of the Londres/London family. There is reason to suspect that she was also matrilineally descended from a family native to southern Scotland. If correct, this could explain why Walter was granted the lands of Mow. Alternately, it is possible that Eschina's rights to Mow merely stemmed from her marriage to Walter. Eschina and Walter were the parents of Alan, Walter's successor. The couple may have also been the parents of a Christina, a woman who married into the Brus and Dunbar families. Walter was an ancestor of the Stewart family, from which descended the royal Stewart/Stuart dynasty. He died in 1177. Ancestry and arrival in Scotland Locations relating to the life and times of Walter. Walter was a member of the Fitz Alan family.Young; Stead (2010) pp. 23, 26–27. He was born in about 1110.Barrow (2004). Walter was a son of Alan fitz Flaald (died 1121×) and Avelina de Hesdin.Fox (2009) pp. 63 fig. 2, 73; Barrow (1980) p. 13. Alan and Avelina had three sons: Jordan, William, and Walter.Young; Stead (2010) p. 26; Fox (2009) pp. 63 fig. 2, 73. Walter's father was a Breton knight who was granted lands in Shropshire by Henry I, King of England. Previous to this, Alan had acted as steward to the bishops of Dol in Brittany.Boardman (2007) p. 85. Walter was a minor English landholder. He held North Stoke, north of Arundel, by way of a grant from his brother, William.Barrow (1980) p. 19; Barrow (1973) p. 338; Eyton (1856) p. 347. There is reason to suspect that Walter also held Manhood, south of Chichester.Barrow (1980) pp. 19, 67; Barrow (1973) p. 338; Registrum Monasterii de Passelet (1832) pp. 2–3; Valor Ecclesiasticus (1817) p. 216; Document 2/86/1 (n.d.). He also held land at \\"Conelon\\" or \\"Couten\\", a place that possibly refers to Cound in Shropshire.Barrow (1980) p. 19; Barrow (1973) p. 338; Eyton (1858a) p. 70; Eyton (1856) p. 347; Dugdale (1846) p. 822 § 24. Walter appears to have arrived in Scotland in about 1136, during the reign of David I, King of Scotland.Hammond, M (2010) p. 5; Barrow (2004); Barrow (2001) n. 89; Alexander (2000) p. 157; Barrow (1999) pp. 34–35, 81 § 57; Duncan (1996) p. 136; McWilliams (1995) p. 43; Barrow (1980) pp. 13, 64; Barrow (1973) pp. 337–338. Following Henry's death in 1135, the Fitz Alans evidently sided with David in his support of the contested English royal claims of Henry's daughter, Matilda.Barrow (2001) p. 249. Certainly, both William and Walter witnessed acts of Matilda in 1141.Barrow (2001) n. 89; Cronne; Davis; Davis (1968) pp. 145 § 377, 146 § 378, 302–303 § 821. In any event, the date of Walter's introduction into Scotland may be marked by the original part of the so-called \\"foundation charter\\" of Melrose Abbey, which records Walter as a witness.Alexander (2000) p. 157; Barrow (1999) p. 111 § 120; Barrow (1973) p. 338; Lawrie (1905) pp. 108 § 141, 375–376 § 141; Document 1/4/56 (n.d.). David I, King of Scotland as he is depicted in a mid twelfth-century royal charter. Walter served as David's or (steward).Ewart; Pringle; Caldwell et al. (2004) pp. 11–12; Barrow (1999) pp. 34–35; Duncan (1996) p. 136; McGrail (1995) p. 41; McWilliams (1995) p. 43; Barrow (1980) pp. 13–14, 64; Barrow; Scott (1971) p. 34. He served in this capacity for three successive Scottish kings: David, Malcolm IV, and William I.Taylor (2008) p. 107; McWilliams (1995) p. 43; Barrow (1980) p. 64; Barrow; Scott (1971) p. 34. Walter is increasingly attested by royal charters from about 1150,Barrow (1999) p. 35. and it is possible that it was at about this time that David granted him the stewardship to be held heritably.Hammond, M (2010) p. 5; Barrow (1999) p. 35. As the king's steward, Walter would have been responsible for the day-to-day running of the king's household.Ewart; Pringle; Caldwell et al. (2004) p. 12; Barrow (1981) p. 40. Whilst the chamberlain was responsible for the king's sleeping compartments, the steward oversaw the king's hall.Hammond, M (2010) p. 5; Barrow (1999) p. 34. It is possible that David sought to replace the Gaelic office of (\\"food-divider\\") with that of the steward.Hammond, M (2010) p. 5. This office certainly appears to have been a precursor to the stewardship.Barrow (1999) p. 35; Bannerman (1989) p. 138. Walter's ancestors were stewards to the Breton lords of Dol.Hammond, M (2010) p. 2; Roberts (1997) p. 35; Barrow (1973) p. 338. In fact, his elder brother, Jordan, inherited this stewardship from their father,Hammond, M (2010) p. 3. and held this office at the time of Walter's own establishment in Scotland. As such, it is probable that Walter possessed a degree of experience in the profession. Scott, JG (1997) pp. 12–13 fig. 1; Barrow (1975) p. 125 fig. 4. Walter's domain included the depicted regions of Strathgryfe, Renfrew, Mearns, and North Kyle. Clydesdale and South Kyle were royal lordships, whilst Cunningham was a Morville lordship.Barrow (1975) pp. 125 fig. 4, 131, 131 fig. 6. Walter lived during a period in history when Scottish monarchs sought to attract men to their kingdom by promising them gifts of land. To such kings, royal authority depended upon their ability to give away territories in the peripheries of the realm.Taylor (2016) p. 182. Although the twelfth-century Scottish monarchs did not create any new earldoms for the incoming Anglo- Norman magnates, they did grant them provincial lordships. The most important of these mid-century colonial establishments were: Annandale for Robert de Brus; Upper Eskdale and Ewesdale for Robert Avenel; Lauderdale and Cunningham for Hugh de Morville; Liddesdale for Ranulf de Sules; and Mearns, Strathgryfe, Renfrew and North Kyle for Walter himself.Grant (2008); Stringer (1985) p. 31; Duncan (1996) pp. 135–136. As a result of their tenure in high office, and their dominating regional influence, these provincial lords were equal to the native Scottish earls in all but rank.Stringer (1985) p. 31. Birkenside, Legerwood and Mow from Malcolm IV, King of Scotland.Anderson; Anderson (1938) pp. 162–164 n. 2; Neilson (1923) pp. 126–128, 146–147 pl. 11a; Document 1/5/59 (n.d.). In 1161×1162, Malcolm confirmed Walter's stewardship, and confirmed David's grants of Renfrew, Paisley, Pollock, \\"Talahret\\", Cathcart, Dripps, Mearns, Eaglesham, Lochwinnoch and Innerwick. He also granted Walter West Partick, Inchinnan, Stenton, Hassenden, Legerwood and Birkenside, as well as a toft with twenty acres in every burgh and demesne in the realm. For this grant, Walter owed his sovereign the service of five knights.Gledhill (2016) p. 104; Taylor (2016) p. 160; Hammond, MH (2011) pp. 139–140; Oram (2011) pp. 12, 309; Hammond, M (2010) p. 6; Grant (2008); Taylor (2008) p. 107; Boardman (2007) p. 85; Hammond, MH (2005) p. 40 n. 33; Barrow; Royan (2004) p. 167; Ewart; Pringle; Caldwell et al.

The grant of lodgings in every important royal settlement would have only been entrusted to people particularly close to the king, and to those who were expected to travel with him.Taylor (2008) p. 107. The impressive list of twenty-nine eminent men who attested this transaction appears to be evidence that the proceedings took place in a public setting before the royal court.Hammond, MH (2011) pp. 139–140. At some point during his career, Walter received North KyleEwart; Pringle; Caldwell et al. (2004) pp. 12, 127; Barrow (1975) p. 131; Barrow (1973) p. 339. from either David or Malcolm.Ewart; Pringle; Caldwell et al. (2004) pp. 12, 127; Roberts (1997) p. 35; Barrow (1973) p. 339. Also in 1161×1162—perhaps on the same date as Malcolm's aforesaid charter to WalterTaylor (2016c) p. 160 n. 236; Hammond, M (2010) p. 6.—the king granted Walter the lands of Mow for the service of one knight.Taylor (2018) p. 44 n. 34; Oram (2011) p. 309; Hammond, M (2010) p. 6; Hammond, MH (2005) p. 40 n. 33; Barrow; Royan (2004) p. 167; Webb, N (2004) pp. 36–37, 51, 208; Barrow (1980) p. 65, 65 n. 18; Barrow (1975) p. 131; Barrow (1973) pp. 294, 353; Barrow; Scott (1971) p. 283 § 245; Anderson; Anderson (1938) pp. 162–164 n. 2; Neilson (1923) pp. 126–128; Document 1/5/59 (n.d.). There is reason to suspect that David's original grant of lands to Walter took place in 1136. Certainly in 1139×1146, Walter witnessed a charter of David to the cathedral of Glasgow in which the king invested the cathedral with assets from Carrick, Cunningham, Strathgryfe and Kyle.Sharpe (2011) pp. 93–94 n. 236, 94; Barrow (1999) p. 81 § 57; Scott, JG (1997) p. 35; Lawrie (1905) pp. 95–96 § 105; Registrum Episcopatus Glasguensis (1843) p. 12 § 9; Document 1/4/30 (n.d.). In 1165, Walter is stated to have held lands worth two knight's fees in Shropshire.Eyton (1856) p. 347; Hearnii (1774) p. 144. As such, the vast majority of his holdings were located north of the Anglo- Scottish border.Stringer (1985) p. 179. Ecclesiastical actions Ruinous Wenlock Priory. Walter appears to have been a devotee of this English Cluniac priory. Walter was a benefactor of Melrose Abbey, and granted this religious house the lands of Mauchline in Ayrshire.Taylor (2016) p. 92; Márkus (2009a) p. 50; Webb, N (2004) pp. 123–124; Duncan (1996) p. 180; Eyton (1858b) p. 225, 225 n. 66; Eyton (1856) p. 348; Liber Sancte Marie de Melrose (1837a) pp. 55–56 § 66; Document 3/547/8 (n.d.).

Walter founded Paisley Priory in about 1163.Ditchburn (2010) p. 183 n. 34; Young; Stead (2010) p. 26; Hammond, MH (2010) p. 79, 79 tab. 2; Hammond, M (2010) p. 4; Barrow; Royan (2004) p. 167; Lewis (2003) p. 28; Barrow (1999) p. 35; McDonald, RA (1997) p. 222; Duncan (1996) p. 180; McDonald, A (1995) pp. 211–212; McWilliams (1995) p. 43; Stringer (1985) p. 298 n. 53; Barrow (1980) p. 67; Anderson; Anderson (1938) pp. 162–164 n. 2; Eyton (1856) pp. 338, 348; Registrum Monasterii de Passelet (1832) pp. 1–2; Document 3/547/11 (n.d.). This religious house was initially established at Renfrew—at King's Inch near Renfrew Castle—before removing to Paisley within a few years.Hammond, MH (2011) p. 135; Hammond, MH (2010) p. 79; Young; Stead (2010) p. 26; Barrow; Royan (2004) p. 167; Shead (2003) p. 21; McDonald, RA (1997) p. 223; McDonald, A (1995) p. 212; McWilliams (1995) pp. 46–47; Macquarrie, A (1990) p. 16; Stevenson, JB (1986) p. 27; Barrow (1980) p. 67; Barrow (1973) p. 340; Brown (1927) p. 274. The fact that Walter made this a Cluniac monastery could be evidence that he was personally devoted to the Cluniac Wenlock Priory in Shropshire.Barrow (1981) p. 80. Alternately, the decision to associate Wenlock with his foundation at Renfrew could have stemmed from a devotion to the cult of Wenlock's patron saint: St Milburga. An early twentieth-century depiction of the Siege of Lisbon in 1147. There is reason to suspect that Walter was amongst the Scots who took part in the campaign to liberate Lisbon from the Moors. Walter's priory at Paisley was dedicated in part to St James the Greater.Hammond, MH (2010) pp. 78–79, 79–80 tab. 2; Hammond, M (2010) p. 5; Barrow (1999) p. 35; McWilliams (1995) p. 44; Barrow (1980) p. 67. This, coupled with the fact that Walter did not witness any of David's acts during a span of time in 1143×1145, could be evidence that Walter undertook a pilgrimage to the shrine of St James the Greater at Santiago de Compostela. In the spring of 1147, Scots joined an Anglo-Flemish fleet in Dartmouth, and set off to join the Second Crusade.Macquarrie, AD (1982) pp. 21, 71–72. The presence of Scots in this multi-ethnic fighting force is specifically attested by the twelfth-century texts De expugnatione Lyxbonensi and Gesta Friderici imperatoris.Macquarrie, AD (1982) p. 72; David (1936) pp. 104–107; Waitz (1912) p. 63. In June, this fleet of Englishmen, Flemings, Normans, Rhinelanders, and Scots arrived at Lisbon, and joined the King of Portugal's months-long siege of the city.Macquarrie, AD (1982) pp. 72–73. Some of the adventurers who participated in the expedition—a fifty-ship detachment of Rhinelanders—clearly visited Santiago de Compostela.Edgington (2015) p. 267. It is possible that Walter was one the Scots who took part in the Lisbon expedition. Paisley Abbey. Walter founded the original priory in about 1163. Renfrew may well have served as the caput of the Strathgryfe group of holdings held by Walter,McDonald, RA (2000) p. 183; Barrow (1973) p. 339; McDonald; McLean (1992) p. 20; Barrow (1960) p. 20. and could have been the main caput of all his holdings.Young; Stead (2010) p. 26; McDonald, RA (2000) p. 183; McDonald, RA (1997) p. 66; McDonald; McLean (1992) p. 16; Barrow (1973) p. 339. The fact that he chose Paisley to serve as a priory does not necessarily mean that Renfrew was his principal caput. In fact, there is reason to suspect that North Kyle served as Walter's power centre. For example, Walter granted this religious house a tithe from all his lands excepting North Kyle. The fact that he granted away only one piece of land in North Kyle—as opposed to his extensive donations elsewhere—suggests that North Kyle was his largest block of his own demesne.Ewart; Pringle; Caldwell et al. (2004) p. 13; Lees (1878) pp. 32–34; Registrum Monasterii de Passelet (1832) pp. 5–6; Document 3/547/13 (n.d.). As such, the archaeological evidence of a twelfth-century motte at Dundonald could indicate that Walter constructed Dundonald Castle, an earth and timber fortress, as his principal caput.Ewart; Pringle; Caldwell et al. (2004) pp. 127, 130. The uneven distribution of Walter's grants to Paisley Priory seems to have been a result of the fact that he had subinfeudated most of Strathgryfe by the time of its establishment.Hammond, M (2010) p. 11; Ewart; Pringle; Caldwell et al. (2004) p. 13. Walter's extensive territories consisted of regions inhabited by native speakers of English, Cumbric, and Gaelic.Barrow (1980) p. 65. From the years spanning 1160–1241, there are roughly one hundred vassals, tenants, and dependants of the Walter and his succeeding son and grandson.Barrow (1980) pp. 65–66. A considerable number of these dependants were evidently drawn from the vicinity of the Fitz Alan lands in Shropshire.Young; Stead (2010) p. 27; Barrow (1980) pp. 65–66. The latter region was largely Welsh-speaking at the time, and it is possible that this languages was then mutually intelligible with Breton, Cumbric. If so, it could indicate that Walter and his dependants were purposely settled in the west to take advantage of this linguistic affiliation. As such, it may have been hoped that such incoming settlers would possess a degree of legitimacy from the natives as fellow Britons.Hicks (2003) p. 47, 47 n. 121. Eschina de Londres Walter was married to Eschina de Londres (fl. 1177×1198).Hammond, M (2010) p. 7; Taylor (2008) pp. 104–105 n. 38; Barrow (2004); Barrow; Royan (2004) p. 167; Webb, N (2004) pp. 55 n. 51, 58; Barrow (1995) p. 8; McWilliams (1995) p. 43; Barrow (1980) pp. 14, 65; Brown (1927) p. 275; Origines Parochiales Scotiae (1851) p. 417. It is likely that the king—either David or Malcolm—arranged the union.Webb, N (2004) p. 58; Barrow (1980) pp. 14, 65, 65 n. 18. Eschina is variously accorded locative names such as de Londres and de Molle.Barrow (1980) pp. 65, 193; Liber S. Marie de Calchou (1846) pp. 113 § 146, 114 § 147, 115 § 148; Liber Sancte Marie de Melrose (1837a) p. 259 § 294. The former name appears to indicate that her father was a member of the Londres (or London) family.Barrow (1980) pp. 65, 184; Barrow (1973) p. 354. One possibility is that this man was Richard de London.Barrow (1980) p. 184. The various forms of Eschina's locative surname de Molle could indicate that she was a maternal granddaughter and heir of a previous Lord of Mow: a certain Uhtred, son of Liulf.Barrow (1980) p. 65; Barrow (1973) p. 354; Barrow; Scott (1971) p. 283 § 245. Uhtred is known to have granted the church of Mow to Kelso Abbey during David's reign.Barrow; Scott (1971) p. 283 § 245; Lawrie (1905) p. 160 § 196, 412 § 196; Origines Parochiales Scotiae (1851) pp. 413, 417; Liber S. Marie de Calchou (1846) pp. 144–145 § 176; Document 1/5/24 (n.d.); Document 3/421/1 (n.d.). A seal of Walter and Eschina's son, Alan, displaying the latter's coat of arms.Stevenson, JH (1914) pp. 16–17 pl. 1 fig. 1, 17; Macdonald, WR (1904) p. 320 § 2535; Birch (1895) p. 265 § 15731; Hewison (1895) pp. 38–39 fig. 2; Laing (1850) pp. 127 § 772, pl. 3 fig. 2; Liber Sancte Marie de Melrose (1837b) pl. 7 fig. 2. Alan's seal is the earliest depiction of heraldry borne by the Stewart family. If Eschina indeed possessed an inherited claim to Mow, it is possible that Walter's grant of this territory was given from the king in the context of Walter's marriage to her.Hammond, M (2010) p. 7; Barrow; Royan (2004) p. 167; Barrow (1980) p. 65 n. 18; Barrow; Scott (1971) p. 283 § 245. The fact that Uhtred seems to have had a son and a brother could be evidence that the king had overridden the inheritance rights of Uhtred's male heirs.Barrow (1980) p. 65 n. 18. On the other hand, an alternate possibility is that Eschina only possessed rights to Mow as a result of her marriage to Walter.Webb, N (2004) p. 55 n. 51. Walter was Eschina's first husband. She survived Walter, and her second husband was probably Henry de Cormunnock,Webb, N (2004) pp. 54–55; Webb, NM (2003) pp. 230 n. 20, 232; Barrow (1980) p. 65 n. 18; Origines Parochiales Scotiae (1851) p. 417. by whom she had two daughters: CeciliaWebb, N (2004) pp. 53–54; Barrow (1980) p. 65 n. 18. and Maud. Eschina's grant to Paisley Priory records that her daughter, Margaret, was buried there.Hammond, M (2010) p. 11; Neville (2005) pp. 32–33; McWilliams (1995) p. 48; Lees (1878) pp. 45–46; Origines Parochiales Scotiae (1851) p. 417; Registrum Monasterii de Passelet (1832) pp. 74–75; Document 3/358/7 (n.d.). A daughter of Walter may have been Christina, a widow of William de Brus, Lord of Annandale, and second wife of Patrick I, Earl of Dunbar.Hamilton (2003) p. 199. Christina's kinship with Walter's family could account for the Dunbars' later possession of Birkenside.Hamilton (2003) p. 199; Liber S. Marie de Dryburgh (1847) pp. 85 § 120, 250 § 311; Document 3/15/74 (n.d.); Document 3/15/121 (n.d.). Galloway Malcolm IV as he is depicted in a mid twelfth-century royal charter. Walter may have campaigned with the king on the Continent. Walter witnessed an act by Malcolm at Les Andelys in Normandy. This charter appears to reveal that Walter was one the Scottish barons who accompanied the king upon the English campaign against the French at Toulouse in 1159. This record is the only known act of the king on the Continent.Webb, N (2004) p. 149; Barrow (1973) pp. 285–286, 286 n. 26. Malcolm returned to Scotland in 1160, having spent months campaigning in the service of the English. Upon his return, the king was forced to confront an attempted coup at Perth.Scott, WW (2008); Ewart; Pringle; Caldwell et al. (2004) p. 12; Oram (1988) p. 90; Neville (1983) pp. 50–53. Having successfully dealt with this considerable number of disaffected magnates, the twelfth- to thirteenth-century Chronicle of Holyrood and Chronicle of Melrose reveal that Malcolm launched three military expeditions into Galloway.Ewart; Pringle; Caldwell et al. (2004) p. 12; Carpenter (2003) ch. 7 ¶ 48; Oram (2000) p. 80; Brooke (1991) pp. 52–54; Anderson; Anderson (1938) pp. 136–137, 136–137 n. 1, 189; Anderson (1922) pp. 244–245; Stevenson, J (1856) pp. 128–129; Stevenson, J (1835) p. 77. Although the names of the king's accomplices are unrecorded, it is probable that Walter was amongst them.Ewart; Pringle; Caldwell et al. (2004) p. 12. The circumstances surrounding these invasions is unclear;Oram (2000) p. 80. what is clear, however, is that Fergus, Lord of Galloway submitted to the Scots before the end of the year.Scott, WW (2008); Oram (2000) p. 80. Specifically, according to the thirteenth-century Gesta annalia I, once the Scots subdued the Gallovidians, the conquerors forced Fergus to retire to Holyrood Abbey, and hand over his son, Uhtred, as a royal hostage.Oram (1988) p. 93; Skene (1872) p. 251 ch. 3; Skene (1871) p. 256 ch. 3. On one hand, it is possible that Fergus himself had precipitated Malcolm's Gallovian campaign, by raiding into the territory between the rivers Urr and Nith.McDonald, RA (2002) p. 116 n. 55; Brooke (1991) pp. 54–56. The fact that the Chronicle of Holyrood describes Malcolm's Gallovidian opponents as \\"federate enemies\\", and makes no mention of his sons, suggests that Fergus was supported by other accomplices.Oram (2000) p. 80; Anderson; Anderson (1938) pp. 136–137, 136 n. 1, 189; Anderson (1922) p. 245. In fact, it is possible that Malcolm had encountered an alliance between Fergus and Somairle mac Gilla Brigte, King of the Isles.Woolf (2013) pp. 4–5; Oram (2011) p. 122; Oram (2000) pp. 80–81. The Isles king gaming piece of the so-called Lewis chessmen.Caldwell; Hall; Wilkinson (2009) p. 156 fig. 1g.

The various depictions of Somairle's forces—stated to have been drawn from Argyll, Dublin, and the Isles—appear to reflect the remarkable reach of power that this man possessed at his peak.Oram (2011) p. 128; Oram (2000) p. 76. According to the Chronicle of Melrose, Somairle landed at Renfrew, and was defeated and slain by the people of the district.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 245; Ewart; Pringle; Caldwell et al.

This stated location of could be evidence that the target of Somairle's strike was Walter.Oram (2011) p. 128; Scott, WW (2008); McDonald; McLean (1992) p. 20. Nevertheless, the leadership of the Scottish forces is uncertain.Barrow (1960) p. 20. It is conceivable that the commander was one of the three principal men of the region: Herbert, Bishop of Glasgow,Oram (2011) p. 128; Woolf (2004) p. 105; Barrow (1960) p. 20. Baldwin, Sheriff of Lanark/Clydesdale,Oram (2011) p. 128; Barrow (1960) p. 20. and Walter himself.Ewart; Pringle; Caldwell et al.

Whilst there is reason to suspect that Somairle focused his offensive upon Walter's lordship at Renfrew,Oram (2011) p. 128; Hammond, M (2010) p. 13; Scott, WW (2008); Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 245; McDonald, RA (2000) pp. 183–184; Roberts (1997) p. 96; Barrow (1960) p. 20. it is also possible that Hebert, as Malcolm's agent in the west, was the intended target.Pollock (2005) p. 14. Certainly, Carmen de Morte Sumerledi associates Herbert with the victory,Woolf (2013) pp. 7–11; Clancy (2012) p. 19; Clancy (2007) p. 126; Sellar (2004); Durkan (2003) p. 230; Durkan (1998) p. 137; Barrow (1981) p. 48; Barrow (1960) p. 20; Brown (1927) p. 274; Anderson (1922) pp. 256–258; Lawrie (1910) pp. 80–83 § 62; Arnold (1885) pp. 387–388; Skene (1871) pp. 449–451. and makes no mention of Walter or any Scottish royal forces.Clanchy (2014) p. 169; Brown (1927) pp. 274–275. On the other hand, Baldwin's nearby lands of Inverkip and Houston were passed by Somairle's naval forces, suggesting that it was either Baldwin or his followers who engaged and overcame the invaders. The name of Somairle mac Gilla Brigte as it appears on folio 133r of Cambridge Corpus Christi College 139 (Carmen de Morte Sumerledi): \\"'\\".Arnold (1885) p. 388; Skene (1871) p. 450; Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 139 (n.d.). Exactly why Somairle struck out at the Scots is unknown.Oram (2011) p. 128; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 245; Woolf (2004) p. 105. This man's rise to power appears to coincide with an apparent weakening of Scottish royal authority in Argyll.Woolf (2004) pp. 102–103. Although David may well have regarded Argyll as a Scottish tributary, Somairle's ensuing career clearly reveals that the latter regarded himself a fully independent ruler.Oram (2011) pp. 87–88. Somairle's first attestation by a contemporary source occurs in 1153,Woolf (2013) pp. 2–3. when the Chronicle of Holyrood reports that he backed the cause of his , the Meic Máel Coluim, in an unsuccessful coup after David's death.MacInnes (2019) p. 122; Wadden (2014) p. 39; Woolf (2013) pp. 2–3; Oram (2011) pp. 72, 111–112; Carpenter (2003) ch. 7 ¶ 46; Ross (2003) pp. 184–185; Anderson; Anderson (1938) pp. 124–125, 187; Anderson (1922) p. 223–224; Bouterwek (1863) p. 36; Stevenson, J (1856) p. 73. These —possibly nephews or grandsons of Somairle—were the sons of Máel Coluim mac Alasdair, a claimant to the Scottish throne, descended from an elder brother of David, Alexander I, King of Scotland.Wadden (2013) p. 208; Woolf (2013) p. 3; Oram (2011) pp. 112, 120; Ross (2003) pp. 181–185; Oram (2001). Four years later Somairle launched his final invasion of Scotland, and it is possible that it was conducted in the context of another attempt to support Máel Coluim's claim to the Scottish throne.Woolf (2004) p. 104. Some twelfth-century lordships, created by David I and Malcolm IV, appear to have carved out of territories previously occupied by the Gall Gaidheil. Somairle may have attempted to regain these lands from the Scots. Another possibility is that Somairle was attempting to secure a swathe of territory that had only recently been secured by the Scottish Crown. Although there is no record of Somairle before 1153, his family was evidently involved in an earlier insurrection by Máel Coluim against David that ended with Máel Coluim's capture and imprisonment in 1134. An aftereffect of this failed insurgency may be perceptible in a Scottish royal charter issued at Cadzow in about 1136. This source records the Scottish Crown's claim to cáin in Carrick, Kyle, Cunningham, and Strathgryfe.Woolf (2004) p. 103; Sharpe (2011) pp. 93–94 n. 236, 94; Barrow (1999) p. 81 § 57; Scott, JG (1997) p. 35; Lawrie (1905) pp. 95–96 § 125, 361–362 § 125; Registrum Episcopatus Glasguensis (1843) p. 12 § 9; Document 1/4/30 (n.d.). Historically, this region appears to have once formed part of the territory dominated by the Gall Gaidheil,Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 241; Woolf (2004) pp. 96–97, 99. a people of mixed Scandinavian and Gaelic ethnicity.Woolf (2004) pp. 96–97. One possibly is that these lands had formerly comprised part of a Gall Gaidheil realm before the Scottish Crown overcame Máel Coluim and his supporters. The Cadzow charter is one of several that mark the earliest record of Fergus.Woolf (2004) p. 103; McDonald, RA (2000) p. 171. This man's attestation could indicate that, whilst Somairle's family may have suffered marginalisation as a result of Máel Coluim's defeat and David's consolidation of the region, Fergus and his family could have conversely profited at this time as supporters of David's cause. The record of Fergus amongst the Scottish elite at Cadzow is certainly evidence of the increasing reach of David's royal authority in the 1130s.Oram (2011) p. 89. rook gaming piece of the Lewis chessmen.Caldwell; Hall; Wilkinson (2009) pp. 161 fig. 6g, 185 fig. 12. Another figure first attested by these charters is Walter, who may have been granted the lands of Strathgryfe, Renfrew, Mearns, and North Kyle on the occasion of David's grant of cáin.Scott, JG (1997) p. 35. One explanation for Somairle's invasion is that he may have been compelled to counter a threat that WalterClanchy (2014) p. 169; Oram (2011) p. 128; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 243, 245; Woolf (2004) p. 105; McDonald, RA (1997) pp. 65–66.—and other recently-enfeoffed Scottish magnates—posed to his authority.Oram (2011) pp. 127–128; McDonald, RA (1997) pp. 65–66. A catalyst of this collision of competing spheres of influence may have been the vacuum left by the assassination of Somairle's father-in-law, Óláfr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles, in 1153. Although the political uncertainty following Óláfr's elimination would have certainly posed a threat to the Scots, the concurrent build-up of Scottish power along the western seaboard—particularly exemplified by Walter's expansive territorial grants in the region—meant that the Scots were also positioned to capitalise upon the situation.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 241–243. In fact, there is reason to suspect that, during Malcolm's reign—and perhaps with Malcolm's consent—Walter began to extend his own authority into the Firth of Clyde, the islands of the Clyde, the southern shores of Cowal, and the fringes of Argyll.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 243, 245. The allotment of Scottish fiefs along the western seaboard suggests that these lands were settled in the context of defending the Scottish realm from external threats located in Galloway and the Isles.McDonald, RA (2000) pp. 181–182; McDonald, RA (1997) p. 65; Barrow (1973) p. 339. It was probably in this context that substantial western lordships were granted to Hugh de Morville, Robert de Brus, and Walter.Carpenter (2003) ch. 6 ¶ 44; McDonald, RA (1997) p. 65. As such, the mid-part of the twelfth century saw a steady consolidation of Scottish power along the western seaboard by some of the realm's greatest magnates—men who could well have encroached into Somairle's sphere of influence.Oram (2011) p. 127; McDonald, RA (1997) pp. 65–66. The remarkably poor health of Malcolm—a man who went on to die before reaching the age of twenty-five—combined with the rising power of Somairle along Scotland's western seaboard, could account for Malcolm's confirmation Walter's stewardship and lands in 1161×1162. As such, Walter may have sought written confirmation of his rights in light of the external threats that faced the Scottish Crown.Hammond, M (2010) p. 7. In fact, one possibility is that the king's serious illness was a specific impetus for Somairle's campaign. Somairle may have intended to seize upon Malcolm's poor health to strike out at the Scots and limit the western spread of their influence.Oram (2011) p. 128.

Before his demise, Walter retired to Melrose Abbey, and died there a lay member of the monastery.McWilliams (1995) p. 51; Anderson; Anderson (1938) pp. 162, 162–164 n. 2; Anderson (1922) p. 297, 297 nn. 4–5; Ferguson (1899) p. 10; Lees (1878) pp. 52–53; Eyton (1858b) p. 225; Stevenson, J (1856) p. 136; Stevenson, J (1835) p. 88. He was thereafter buried at Paisley.McAndrew (2006) p. 62; McWilliams (1995) p. 51. Walter's son and successor, Alan, does not appear to have equalled Walter's consistent attendance of the royal court.Webb, N (2004) pp. 156–157; Barrow; Scott (1971) p. 34. It was during the tenure of Walter's great-grandson, Alexander Stewart, Steward of Scotland, that the title of dapifer regis Scotie (\\"steward of the king of Scotland\\") came to be replaced by the style senescallus Scotie (\\"steward of Scotland\\"). It was also during this generation that forms of the surname Stewart began to be borne by Walter's descendants.Hammond, M (2010) p. 13; Barrow (2004). Specifically, his like-named great-grandson, Walter Stewart, Earl of Menteith, is the first such descendant known to have adopted senescallus as a surname without having possessed the office of steward. Walter was the founder of the Stewart family,Barrow (2004); Barrow (2001) n. 89; Roberts (1997) p. 35; McWilliams (1995) p. 382 n. 9; Barrow (1973) p. 322. from which descended the royal Stewart dynasty.Roberts (1997) p. 35; McWilliams (1995) p. 382 n. 9.

They form the only large dune system (over 30 km²) in Japan. The dunes were created by sediment deposits carried from the Chūgoku Mountains by the Sendai River into the Sea of Japan. Sea currents and wind help bring the sand from the bottom up onto the shore, where the wind constantly rearranges their shape. The dunes have existed for over 100,000 years, but the area of the dunes has been steadily decreasing due to a government reforestation program following World War II. Additionally, concrete barriers erected to protect the coast (the part of Sanin Kaigan National Park) from tsunamis have disrupted the currents responsible for bringing the sand to shore. Authorities have adopted measures to stop the shrinkage of the dunes, partly because they attract a significant amount of tourism to the area. The Tottori prefectural government has attempted to dump sand off the shore near the dunes in the hopes that it will wash ashore, as well as employing the manual removal of encroaching grassy areas. The lasting ability for these efforts to protect the dunes is as yet unknown. Each year, around two million visitors--mostly from within Japan and East Asia--visit the dunes. The dunes form a major geosite in the San'in Kaigan Geopark.

It is located at the north-western corner of Swansea Bay near the village of Mumbles, within the city and county of Swansea, Wales. Construction Designed by W. Sutcliffe Marsh and promoted by John Jones Jenkins of the Rhondda and Swansea Bay Railway, the pier opened on 10 May 1898 at a cost of £10,000. It was the western terminus for the world's first passenger carrying railway, the Swansea and Mumbles Railway; and a major terminal for the White Funnel paddle steamers of P and A Campbell, unloading tourists from routes along the River Severn and Bristol Channel. Heyday In the summer of 1899, Will C. Pepper, father of the musicians Harry S. Pepper and Dick Pepper, founded a long-running concert party on the Pier called the White Coons.Asa Briggs, The History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom: Volume II: The Golden Age, p. 85 The Amusement Equipment Company (AMECO) gained a licence to operate the pier from 1 October 1937. The pier was requisitioned in World War II, but AMECO acquired the freehold in 1957, extensively reconstructing the facility and adding a landing jetty. A new arcade was built on the pier's frontage in 1966. AMECO spent between £25,000 and £30,000 per annum on the maintenance and replacement of the steelwork between 1975 and 1985.Seaside Piers Reopening Closed on 1 October 1987 for a £40,000 refit, which included renewal of the steel around the entrance, the pier reopened on Good Friday 1988. Today, the pier is used only for fishing and tourism, offering panoramic views of Swansea Bay with the Mumbles Lighthouse on one side and Port Talbot on the other. Halfway along the Pier on the Bay side is a Royal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboat station. Still housing the historical records of the local Mumbles lifeboat, the House also currently handles the 'Tyne' Class boat. The Pier complex is owned and operated by the Bollom family. The land beside the pier is now an entertainment complex comprising bars, restaurant, an ice-skating rink (opened in 2006 and featured in an ITV Wales documentary series) and an amusement arcade.  Renovation  During a major renovation in 2012, a new lifeboat station and RNLI gift shop was built at the end of the pier and fishing platforms added. Future plans In recent years the pier has fallen into a state of disrepair with a large section fenced off to visitors and other areas patched up to maintain safety. The owners plan to repair the pier along with the regeneration of the nearby area. The plans include the building of a new hotel and spa, a conference and exhibition centre and a new boardwalk linking the Knab rock with the pier.Best Western Hotels Great Britain - Mumbles pier in Swansea to be restored Amusement Arcade The amusement arcade beside the pier contains over 100 arcade machines and includes a miniature bowling alley on the upper floor.

Career Born in York, Yorkshire, Swann started his career as a trainee with Hull City. In eight years at Boothferry Park Swann became a regular in the Hull team appearing 221 games for the club, scoring 10 goals, helping the club promotion in both the 1982–83 and 1985–86 seasons. It was in November 1986 Preston North End boss John McGrath offered City £10,000 to sign Swann. During his time at Deepdale Swann was usually deployed in midfield, becoming an integral member of the Preston team, helping the club to promotion as runners up from the Fourth Division in his first season. A hard working and often unsung player, Swann also had an uncanny knack of scoring important goals from either his usual midfield position or from full back; his biggest haul of 14 (12 in the league) in 1987–88 season helping keep Preston in the Third Division. Likened to former Liverpool full back Chris Lawler his goalscoring prowess also earned him the nickname \\"The Ghost\\" from Preston manager McGrath due to his ability to appear almost unnoticed at the far post to score, something that soon became his trademark. He was also an ever-present in both the 1987–88 and 1989–90 seasons, finishing runner-up in the club's official player of the year awards on both occasions to Bob Atkins and Warren Joyce respectively. In all, Swann played 250 first team games for Preston, scoring 47 goals, quite an achievement in a side that generally hovered around the wrong end of the league table. At the end of the 1991–92 season, he was released and immediately signed for home town club York City.He helped them to promotion in his first season by scoring the winner in the 2nd leg of their semi final against Bury and then scoring the opening goal in the Third Division play-off final against Crewe Alexandra at Wembley Stadium, a game City won on penalties after drawing 1–1. He also impressed in his second season with the club, helping York reach the play-offs yet again, where they were knocked out in the semi-final. After a highly successful two years at Bootham Crescent, in which he played 95 games, scoring six goals, he moved on to Scarborough (35 games four goals) for a season before playing in Hong Kong and finally returning to England so as to extend his playing career in non- League football. In all Swann played 601 first team games scoring 67 goals. After football Gary now works as a leisure centre manager at Coral Reef, Bracknell.

It was also a type of homecoming, as he was a ballboy at the Cowboys' Thousand Oaks training camp growing up. He couldn't pass Paul McDonald on the depth chart and was waived on September 7. After the players went on a strike on the third week of the 1987 season, those games were canceled (reducing the 16 game season to 15) and the NFL decided that the games would be played with replacement players. Sweeney was signed to be a part of the Dallas Cowboys replacement team, that was given the mock name \\"Rhinestone Cowboys\\" by the media. He became the third ever rookie quarterback to start for the Cowboys, following Don Meredith (1960) and Roger Staubach (1969). He was a very popular player with the fans during those games; accounting for 4 touchdown passes, 20.8 yards per completion and 2 wins. His 77-yard touchdown pass to Cornell Burbage against the Philadelphia Eagles was the team's longest completion of the season. When Danny White took over the team for the third replacement game against the Washington Redskins, the crowd started chanting \\"We Want Sweeney, We Want Sweeney\\" when the team didn't perform well in the eventual 7-13 loss. He was kept on the roster for the rest of the year. On November 6, 1988, he started the second half and passed for three touchdowns against the New York Giants. The next game, he was given the opportunity to start against the Minnesota Vikings, but lost 3-43 after completing just 10 of 28 passes for 93 yards, with 2 interceptions and 2 fumbles.

The Runnymede Theatre is a historic building located in Bloor West Village, an affluent west end Toronto neighbourhood. The building has operated as a vaudeville theatre, a movie theatre, a bingo hall, and a Chapters bookstore. The building is now a Shoppers Drug Mart. History Commonly known as the \\"Runny\\", the Runnymede was built by the Capitol (later Famous Players) as an atmospheric vaudeville theatre, the first of this type in Toronto. It officially opened in June 1927. The building was designed by Alfred Chapman, father of Chris Chapman, an accomplished Toronto filmmaker. Known for its music and stage shows, the large 1400-seat theatre, branded \\"Canada's Theatre Beautiful\\", quickly became popular and brought prestige to the west end of the city.Serbert, John: \\"The 'Nabes': Toronto’s wonderful neighbourhood movie houses.\\", page 67. Mosaic Press, 2001 As an atmospheric theatre, the interior of the Runnymede was designed to transport its guests to an exotic place. The painted blue sky ceiling was adorned with clouds, where a complex lighting system projected an array of stars and airplanes. The walls were decorated with a mural, which produced an illusion of being in a courtyard. The building discontinued to be used for plays and live entertainment with the gradual death of vaudeville, and was subsequently converted to a movie theatre in the late 1930s. In the early 1970s, the building became a bingo hall in order to capitalize on bingo's popularity. In 1980, the building reopened as a movie theatre again, featuring two screens. In 1990, the building was designated as a heritage property under the Ontario Heritage Act. The movie theatre closed in February 1999 and You've Got Mail was the last film that was shown. Later that year, the building reopened as a Chapters bookstore, which closed in February 2014. In April 2015, the building reopened as a Shoppers Drug Mart.

History  From the beginning the Huntington Beach Public Library has been an illustration of citizen concern for the community and its future generations.  1908–09: Beginnings  Shortly before the city was incorporated February 1909, the possibility of opening a library was brought to the attention of the Board of Trade by two citizens, R. W. Blodgett and Mrs. R. H. Lindgren. Efforts of these two citizens aroused the interest of some local organizations and the Huntington Beach Women's Club called a mass meeting on February 15, 1909, to form a library association. = Library association = This meeting resulted in a temporary organization being established and Mrs. Blodgett was asked to draw up a constitution and by-laws for the new organization. The first board of trustees consisted of Mr. A. W. Everett, Mrs. C. D. Heartwell, Mrs. Mary Manske, Miss Alma Wilson and Mr. A. L. Reed. Each member of this board represented a different group or interest in the city. Once the Public Library Association was established, friends in the community began giving books and other necessary things and a home for the new library became a problem. The board decided to buy an old office building which was to be moved and Mr. Reed guaranteed payment of $50 for the roofless building. Mr. S. E. Hearn agreed to allow the board to move the building to a lot at the corner of Walnut Avenue and Main Street for a nominal rent charge. Community involvement in the new library was particularly noteworthy during this period. During the time the citizens and the library trustees were busy readying the new library the city was officially incorporated and a board of trustees, the forerunner of today's city council, was elected. = Community involvement = On June 14, 1909, the president of the Public Library Association, Mr. Everett, appeared before the city board and offered to turn over the library to the city. The subsequent agreement called for the city to set aside $300 for the immediate use of the library, to assume its debts and to support the library with tax funds. After Mr. Everett's appearance before the board, the city governing body enacted Ordinance 18, which established a public library. At this time, the city's board chairman, Ed Manning, appointed the first library board of trustees. Members of the first board were Mr. Everett, president; Mrs. Lindgren, secretary; Mrs. Manske; Mrs. Blodgett; and Ida Vincent. = First librarian = Shortly after the city acquired the new library, Elizabeth Singleton and two assistant librarians from Long Beach came to the city and catalogued the books free of charge. Their lunches and traveling expenses were provided by the Library Board of Trustees. Edith Brown of Long Beach became the first city librarian in July, 1909. At that time there were 338 volumes in the library, 228 were gifts while 110 had been bought new. The new library subscribed to twelve magazines and held hours of 10 a.m. to noon and 2:00 p.m. to 7 p.m. In August, Mr. Hearn, owner of the property where the library was located, notified the Library Board that the library had to move by the end of the year.  1910s: Improvements and expansion  = Relocation and building upgrades = In January 1911, the library was moved to the intersection of Walnut Avenue and 3rd Street. Andrews was granted a leave of absence from her librarian's job in March 1911, and when she failed to return, Bertha Proctor was permanently appointed to take her place in May. At that time, the librarian's salary was $35 per month. During the next few months there were many improvements to the library building and its surroundings but it was becoming more apparent that the need for a permanent library building was surfacing. The Huntington Beach Company offered the city a site provided a $5,000 building was erected on the property. The Library Board began looking for the means to accomplish such an endeavor, but the project was temporarily abandoned when no funds could be located. = Expansion = After some discussion, the Library Board decided to purchase four lots on the corner of Walnut Avenue and 8th Street at a cost of $1900. The Library Board was able to come up with all but $300, so the City Council provided the extra money and by May 1913, the city had acquired a site for the proposed library. Once the lots were clear and title was given to the city the Library Board in cooperation with the City Council, the Huntington Beach Women's Club and the Parent Teacher Association began gathering the necessary data to obtain a Carnegie Library building. = Carnegie Library = 200px In February 1913, councilmen received notification of the $10,000 grant and they notified the Library Board to begin discussing plans for the new library. In August 1913, the Carnegie Corporation accepted the plans and W. D. Lambert of Long Beach received the contract. The cornerstone of the Carnegie Library was laid during a big ceremony. The history of the city, the library, names of all those who had served on the Library Board, city trustees, pastors of the churches, members of the Board of Trade, names of those who had served on the library staff, the name of each child in the schools and a small American flag were enclosed in the stone. In a little over four years the number of volumes in the library had risen from 328 volumes to 2800 volumes, 700 of which were donated by residents of the city. The main floor of the new Carnegie Library housed an adult reading room, a children's department and the librarian's office. The lecture room, a reference room and the furnace room were located downstairs. The Chamber of Commerce was located in the lecture room until 1921. In order to be more responsive to community needs the Library Board decided to establish a reading room at 205 Main Street. The reading room was open the same hours as the main library, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. The reading room was used for a three-year period from 1928 until August 1931.  1933: Earthquake damage  In March 1933, the Carnegie Library suffered considerable damage in the 1933 Long Beach earthquake which struck the area. The board authorized Catching Brothers Company to make the necessary repairs to the Carnegie building. 1934 saw the library lose its librarian of 23 years when Bertha Reynolds (formerly Proctor) resigned. She had seen the library grow from the small building at Walnut Avenue and 3rd Street to the Carnegie Building at Walnut Avenue and 8th Street, and now the library was outgrowing that facility. A preliminary set of plans was submitted to the Library Board by Architects McClelland, McDonald, and Markwith of Los Angeles, but the advent of World War II held up construction until 1949. Margaret Kemp served as temporary librarian until Floyd Jorgensen filled the job in 1937. When he left for the military, Lylyan Mossinger took over and served until 1959. On Friday, July 13, 1951, the Carnegie Library closed its doors after almost 40 years of service. When the doors closed, the library had a total of 42,000 volumes. On Sunday, September 30, 1951, the new library building at 525 Main Street was dedicated by Mayor Vernon Langenbeck. The library was built at a cost of $140,000. Members of the Library Board at the time of the dedication were Pearl M. Jones, president, Berta Tovatt, J. K. McDonald, Edith Vavra, and G. H. Hasson.  1960s: The new Huntington Beach Library  200px The new Huntington Beach Library started its existence in 1967 when librarian Walter Johnson created a program citing the library needs for a growing community and the library board selected the Talbert Avenue site. The City Council then decided to place the library program on the ballot. The issue failed on the election held on November 5, 1968. With approximately 62 percent of the vote in favor of the library, however, the council decided to fund the project through the creation of a Public Facilities Corporation and created a five-man corporation for this purpose. The same body represented the city for the new Civic Center. Members are Dr. Dudley Boyce, Darrell Ward, Robert Polly, William Armstrong, and Larry Curran. Library Board members, wanting a first hand view, toured libraries in California that had recently been constructed and were of similar size. The board developed a list of some 35 architects that they were interested in considering and eventually narrowed it down to 17 whom they invited in for interviews. Of the 17, the firm of Richard & Dion Neutra was asked to design the library. Shortly before the actual signing of the agreement, Richard Neutra died while on tour and his son, Dion, was retained to design the project. 200px The site had been selected because of its centralized location, both geographically and by population, and because of the natural beauty surrounding it. A plot of land was purchased for the site, including part of Talbert Lake, and the ground breaking ceremony took place on October 28, 1972.  1980s–present: The Huntington Beach Public Library today  The Huntington Beach Public Library and Cultural Center has since experienced growth and expansion. The library increased its role as a vital community cultural center throughout the following two decades, and by the early 1990s plans were underway to expand its services. The City of Huntington Beach hired the architectural firm of Anthony & Langford to design what became a expansion. The Central library building was expanded to enclose an outdoor spiral ramp and fountain area. The new wing opened in 1994 and included a new Children's area with its own story time theater. The lower level featured five new meeting room, a catering kitchen, and a beautiful 319-seat theater. The library was also an early adopter of utilizing an automated conveyor system to move books through the building. Shortly after the Central library expansion, the Oak View Library branch opened to provide library services to the local Spanish-speaking community. The late 1990s and early 2000s saw the emergence of a \\"virtual\\" branch when the library began offering a web-based catalog of its holdings and online reference databases. With help from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the library embraced the Information Age by providing computer labs with free Internet access. In 2005, a significant computer upgrade was completed which resulted in free wi-fi wireless Internet access, online renewals and reserves, and web-based used book sales. Starting in 2006, the Central library building underwent a phased refurbishment project which saw a return of the neutral brown and green color scheme that was originally envisioned by architect Dion Neutra. = Ron Hayden = Ron Hayden From 1985 until 2008, Ron Hayden served as Library Director. Knowing that library funding was often precarious during lean budget years, he insured the library's survival by establishing innovative revenue streams through development fees, media and room rentals, videoconferencing, and Friends of the Library used book sales. In 1992, Hayden was named Librarian of the Year by the California Library Association.

The British were attempting to deliver a convoy from Gibraltar to Malta. The convoy was escorted by several battleships and an aircraft carrier, to deter interference from the Italian surface fleet, while a close escort of cruisers and destroyers provided an anti-aircraft screen. The Italian fleet sortied after the convoy was detected, but turned back after learning the strength of the escorting force. Air attacks by Italian bombers and fighters damaged several ships, and forced one of the merchant vessels to be scuttled. The rest of the convoy arrived at Malta and discharged their cargo. The convoy Operation Halberd was at the time the largest Malta resupply effort of the war.Greene & Massignani, p.181 Nine merchant ships carrying 81,000 tons of military equipment and supplies sailed from Liverpool on 16 September and from the Clyde on 17 September as part of convoy WS (Winston Specials) 11X, passing Gibraltar on 24 September 1941, with a close escort under the command of Rear-Admiral Harold Burrough.Hague, p.195 The nine ships were:WS CONVOYS - July to December 1941 SAILINGS, including two DM Convoys, WS 10 to 14B * () 'Convoy Commodore' Auxiliary Supply Ship * () Blue Funnel Line * () Ellerman's City Line * () Ellerman & Bucknall * () Clan Line * () Clan Line * () Blue Star Line * () Blue Star Line * () Union-Castle Line British forces Force H, under the command of Admiral James Somerville, accompanied the convoy as defence against Italian surface ships. Force H consisted of the battleships , and with the aircraft carrier operating 12 Fairey Swordfish and 27 Fairey Fulmars of 807 and 808 Naval Air Squadrons. Force H included cruisers , , , and , and was screened by destroyers HNLMS Isaac Sweers, ORP Garland and , and , , , , , , , , , , , , , and . Submarines and patrolled south of the Strait of Messina while and patrolled north of the Strait. The Polish submarine patrolled north of Sicily with and while the Dutch submarine patrolled south of Sardinia. Malta had recently received 27 long-range fighters (22 Bristol Beaufighters and 5 Bristol Blenheims), which had been bombing and strafing Italian airfields on Sicily and Sardinia, and would provide air cover for the convoy after Force H retired before reaching the Sicilian narrows.Greene & Massignani, pp.182-187 Italian forces Italian submarines deployed to ambush the British battleships thought to be planning a bombardment raid against the Italian coast. Dandolo, Adua and Turchese patrolled south of Ibiza while Axum, Serpente, Aradam and Diaspro patrolled east of the Balearic Islands. Squalo, Bandiera and Delfino patrolled Southwest of Sardinia and Narvalo was off the African shore of the Sicilian narrows. Light cruisers Muzio Attendolo and Duca degli Abruzzi of the 8th cruiser division sailed from Palermo with Maestrale-class destroyers Maestrale, Grecale and Scirocco of the 10th destroyer flotilla to take position off La Maddalena. Battleships Vittorio Veneto and Littorio were prepared to sortie from Naples with Granatiere, Fuciliere, Bersagliere and Gioberti of the 13th flotilla, and Nicoloso da Recco, Pessagno and Folgore of the 16th flotilla while cruisers Trieste, Trento and Gorizia from Taranto with Corazziere, Carabiniere, Ascari and Lanciere of the 12th flotilla prepared to join them. Sardinia deployed thirty Macchi C.200, twenty Fiat CR.42 and twenty-six Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 and SM.84 torpedo bombers against the convoy while Sicily deployed fifteen C.200, three Reggiane Re.2000, and nine Junkers Ju 87 with twenty-four Fiat BR.20, SM.79 and SM.84 as high-level bombers and plus three with torpedoes. More Italian aircraft were operational, but were assigned other missions including bombing Malta. Prelude Ships of the Mediterranean Fleet operating from Alexandria began making heavy radio traffic in the hope of diverting Luftwaffe attention to possible preparations for a major operation in the eastern Mediterranean. On 24 September Admiral Somerville shifted his flag from Nelson to Rodney and Nelson sailed west into the Atlantic at 18:15 escorted by Garland, Piorun and Isaac Sweers to give the impression the strength of Force H was being reduced. Nelson turned back after dusk to join the merchant ships from convoy WS 11X, now redesignated convoy GM 2 as the second convoy from Gibraltar to Malta. Force H separated from the merchant ships in the early hours of 25 September so Axis aerial reconnaissance might think only Force H was at sea. Fulmars from Ark Royal provided air cover over the convoy. Italian aircraft found Force H on the afternoon of 25 September, and assumed the battleships were on a bombardment raid against the Italian coast. A CANT Z.506 seaplane observing Force H at 09:32 on 26 September reported a single battleship with an aircraft carrier incorrectly identified as . Since Ark Royal had been seen leaving Gibraltar, the Italians assumed Furious might be flying off aircraft to reinforce Malta while Ark Royal attacked Genoa. The Italian fleet sailed from Naples to take a defensive position with the 8th cruiser division off northern Sardinia, but was ordered not to engage the British fleet unless the Italians held a decisive superiority of forces. Battle of 27 September Force H rejoined the convoy at 07:10 27 September. Sixteen destroyers formed a bent line screen ahead of two columns of merchant ships. The port column was led by the cruiser Kenya, followed by Ajax, Clan MacDonald, Imperial Star, Rowallan Castle and City of Calcutta. The starboard column was led by the cruiser Edinburgh followed by Clan Ferguson, , HMS Breconshire and City of Lincoln. Rodney took position behind the port wing of the screen followed by Prince of Wales. Nelson took position behind the starboard wing of the screen followed by Ark Royal in formation with the anti-aircraft cruisers Euryalus and Hermione. The cruiser Sheffield took position astern of the merchant ships, while the destroyers Piorun and Legion assumed plane guard positions astern of Ark Royal.Greene & Massignani, p.186 Italian aircraft correctly identified Ark Royal at 08:10, and at 10:45 reported the convoy speed of , which indicated that merchant ships were with the convoy. The battleships from Naples rendezvoused with the cruisers from Taranto at 10:40, and were joined by the 8th cruiser division at 11:48. The Italian fleet was faster than the battleships of Force H, but was inferior to the British force in firepower. The Regia Aeronautica gave priority to fighter defence of bomber strikes, and the six fighters providing air cover over the Italian fleet could not travel more than from their base. Since Italian aircraft had reported only a single British battleship, the Italian fleet received authorization at noon to engage the British formation. The Regia Aeronautica was requested to provide increased air cover for the Italian fleet by 14:00.Greene & Massignani, pp.187-191 The Regia Aeronautica launched a strike of 28 SM.79 and SM.84 torpedo planes with 20 Cr.42 fighters. The convoy came under air attack at 13:00. The strike was met by defending Fulmars and heavy anti-aircraft fire. Three bombers pressed through the barrage of starboard wing destroyers to launch torpedoes at Nelson. Nelson turned to comb the torpedo tracks, and inadvertently steadied on the reciprocal course of a torpedo which struck the port side of the forecastle.The Royal Navy and the Mediterranean Convoys, p.21. This account states that the torpedo attacks were carried out by SM-79 and BR-20 torpedo bombers. Nelson slowed to 15 knots, but maintained position in the convoy. The Italian plane had released the torpedo at a range of only and endured concentrated anti-aircraft fire from Prince of Wales before being shot down by one of the Fulmars. Six more torpedo planes and 1 fighter failed to return from the strike. Friendly fire from Rodney and Prince of Wales shot down two Fulmars, and a patrolling Swordfish had been shot down by the Italian fighters before the strike ended at 13:30. The Italian fleet was shadowed by British aircraft from Malta beginning at 13:07. At 14:30 the Italian fleet was about 40 miles from the convoy, but \\"...decided to return home around 14:30 on the 27th when...\\" it \\"... learned that the British had two battleships, a carrier and six cruisers at sea.\\"The Italian Navy in WW2, Sadkovich, p.181: \\"He therefore decided to return home around 14:30 on the 27th when he learned that the British had two battleships, a carrier and six cruisers at sea.\\" Aircraft from Ark Royal shadowed the Italian fleet from 15:15 to 17:50. Cr.42 fighters arrived at 15:30 to provide air cover, but the squadron leader of the first flight was shot down by friendly fire from an Italian destroyer. Two more Italian pilots were lost when another flight of ten C.200s ran out of fuel and ditched at sea. At 14:46 Prince of Wales, Rodney, Sheffield, Edinburgh, and six destroyers steamed toward the Italian fleet; but were recalled at 17:00 before making contact, and rejoined the convoy at 18:30.The Royal Navy and the Mediterranean Convoys, p.28 Nelson, Rodney, Prince of Wales and Ark Royal turned west to return to Gibraltar escorted by Duncan, Fury, Gurkha, Lance, Legion, Lively. Garland, Piorun, and Isaac Sweers. Euryalus fell in astern of the port column of merchant ships while Sheffield and Hermione joined the starboard column as the remaining destroyers closed into a night steaming formation. The night steaming formation was attacked by a few torpedo bombers, and Imperial Star was struck by a single torpedo. Oribi took the damaged freighter in tow. Italian Motoscafo armato silurante (MAS torpedo boats) deployed through the Strait of Messina, but failed to find the convoy. Aftermath Hermione detached from the convoy to bombard Pantelleria so that airfield would be out of action when the convoy arrived in Malta. The damaged Imperial Star was scuttled without loss of life to maintain convoy speed of advance, and the convoy arrived in Malta on 28 September. Retiring Force H was attacked by three submarines; and Adua was sunk by Gurkha and Legion. Another Ark Royal Fulmar fell to friendly fire from Prince of Wales, raising British aircraft losses to three Fulmars from friendly fire and one Swordfish from enemy action. Italian aircraft losses were 21 including seven bombers and one fighter from enemy action, one fighter from friendly fire, and ten fighters from fuel exhaustion.The Italian Navy in WW2, Sadkovich, p.182 Admiral Somerville was knighted in recognition of his successful command of Force H during Operation Halberd.

Beardmore & Company in Dalmuir (near Glasgow) Scotland. Dublin was launched on 30 April 1912 and completed in March 1913. She was initially assigned to the 1st Battle Squadron in 1913 and then to the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron in July 1913, operating in the Mediterranean. She was then reassigned to the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron from September 1913 to the end of 1914. Pursuit of Goeben Captain John Kelly pursued the German cruiser to Messina (off the north coast of Sicily) on 4 August 1914 just prior to the outbreak of the First World War. On 6 August after having completed coaling, Dublin left Malta at 14:00 to join Rear-Admiral Ernest Troubridge's squadron. At 20:30 she received orders to obtain Goebens course and sink her during the night, by torpedoes if possible. Observing at a distance, Kelly expected to engage around 03:30 but Goeben had unexpectedly altered course to the north. The chase was lost as a daylight attack would be suicidal; Goeben’s largest guns could accurately fire explosive shells up to away. Gallipoli and torpedoing In February 1915, Dublin was sent to the Dardanelles and subsequently assisted 's landing assault upon Gallipoli, on 25 April 1915 at X Beach. She was then sent to Brindisi in May 1915. While taking part in a sweep off the Albanian coast, and whilst escorted by French and Italian destroyers, Dublin was hit and damaged by a torpedo from the Austro-Hungarian Navy submarine U-4 on 9 June 1915. Dublin was able to get underway at and to return to Brindisi but was out of action for several months and had to return to the UK for refit. In home waters Dublin served in the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron alongside Southampton, and with the Grand Fleet from 1916 to 1919. Now under Captain Albert Charles Scott (later Vice Admiral; HMS Dublin 1916-1918), she participated in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916. During the subsequent night actions, Dublin fired 117 6-inch shells and, along with Southampton, attacked and sank a destroyer. Both ships, however, sustained severe damage. Three crew members were killed and 27 wounded when Dublin received five 5.9 shell inch hits from the cruiser and eight 4.1-inch shell hits from (possibly also and ). Subsequent repairs to Dublin were not completed until 17 June. On 3 May 1917 in the North Sea, Dublin with the Australian cruiser and four destroyers (Nepean, Obdurate, Pelican, Pylades), left Rosyth for a sweep between the mouths of the Forth and the Humber. The following day, during an action in the North Sea, Dublin observed the Zeppelin L 43 about 17 miles away to the east at 10:25, rapidly approaching a strange vessel. Both cruisers promptly made for the enemy, opening fire on it at extreme range. At 10:54 Dublin saw the track of a torpedo passing ahead of her. At 11:12 a submarine was sighted and at 11:15 another one was spotted, which fired two torpedoes at her. At 11:20 she sighted a third submarine, which she engaged with her guns and on which she dropped a depth-charge. The Zeppelin made a direct attack: making for the stern of Dublin and rising hastily as it flew, it endeavoured to obtain a position vertically above the cruiser in order to drop bombs on her - an attempt which was foiled by Dublins hurried swerve to starboard.Jose 1941, pp. 294-297 Post-war career Dublin was commissioned for the 6th squadron at the Africa Station from January 1920 until 1924, though she served for a short time in April with the 3rd squadron in the Mediterranean until being sent to the Reserve at Nore in 1924. She was sold for scrapping to J.J. King at Troon in July 1926, but she ran aground on the way to the breakers. She was refloated in July 1927 and broken up later that year.

She was born in Santiago, Chile. She first wrote La Brecha (Breakthrough) in 1961, which is considered to be a landmark feminist Latin-American novel. This novel caused dismay from the reactionary segment of society and loud applause from the critics and is considered a revolutionary departure from the traditional treatment of the feminine role in marriage. Breakthrough is a novel that ends with the heroine's awareness that she didn't really need to depend upon a man in order to lead a fulfilling life. The book enjoyed an unexpected publishing success and went through five consecutive editions. Mercedes Valdivieso had the extreme audacity to become an innovator; she bridged the gap between romantic and domestic fiction in a society where women have been viewed as a sexless gender, icons of virtue, and depending on men to meet the necessities of life. Valdivieso also was founder and director of Adan, a men's magazine, and Breakthrough, a feminist publication, she published articles in newspapers and magazines and she gave many lectures and speeches. She taught literature at the University of Peking, at the University of Houston, at Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches,at University of St. Thomas in Houston and she was a Professor Emeritus at Rice University.

The Intermontane Plate was surrounded by a chain of volcanic islands called the Intermontane Islands, which had been accumulating as a volcanic chain in the Pacific Ocean since the Triassic period, beginning around 245 million years ago. The volcanism records yet another subduction zone. Beneath the far edge of the Intermontane microplate, another plate called the Insular Plate was sinking. This arrangement with two parallel subduction zones is unusual. The modern Philippine Islands are located on the Philippine Mobile Belt, one of the few places on Earth where twin subduction zones exist today. Geologists call the ocean between the Intermontane islands and North America the Slide Mountain Ocean. The name comes from the Slide Mountain Terrane, a region made of rocks from the floor of the ancient ocean.  Collision of the Intermontane Islands  During the early Jurassic period, the Intermontane Islands and the Pacific Northwest drew closer together as the continent moved west and the Intermontane Microplate subducted. On the continent, subduction supported a new volcanic arc that again sent intruding granite-type rocks into the ancient continental sediments. Eventually, about 180 million years ago in the middle Jurassic, the last of the microplate subducted, and the Intermontane Islands collided with the Pacific Northwest. The Intermontane Islands were too big to sink beneath the continent. The subduction zone of the Intermontane Plate shut down, ending the volcanic arc. As the Intermontane Belt accreted to the edge of the continent, the subduction zone of the Insular Plate became the active subduction zone along the edge of the continent.

The character first appeared in Marvel Comics Presents vol. 1 #26 (August 1989). The character was portrayed by James Badge Dale in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Iron Man 3 (2013). Fictional character biography Eric Savin was a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army at Camp Killian, and was put in charge of Project: Ultra- Tech. There he met the love of his life, Lieutenant Gina Dyson. While on patrol, Savin stepped onto a freshly planted mine which blew him into pieces. He was dead for 2.3 minutes. Gina immediately performed cybernetic surgery on him. The surgery was successful — Savin was alive, but resurrected as a cyborg by Mako's Project: Ultra-Tech. Dyson aided him in battling Mako's robots and apparently slew Mako in combat.Marvel Comics Presents #26-35 He then goes by \\"Coldblood-7\\" from there on; the 7 in the name was a mere wordplay on his real name as his surname is pronounced in the same way.Marvel Comics Presents #26 Coldblood gave in to his cyborg-form at one point but was brought back to his human side with Gina's help.Marvel Comics Presents #32 In later missions, Coldblood was hired by Roxxon Oil and had to get a stolen biochemical weapon back from Dr. Jonathan Cayre's lab. Coldblood gained the help of the original Excalibur team and succeeded in his mission. As an urban soldier cyborg, Coldblood operated as a freelance mercenary. He evaded capture by Mechadoom.Deathlok vol. 2 #4 Coldblood hunted down and fought Deathlok (Michael Collins) in Paris. He then joined forces with Deathlok and Siege in defeating Harlan Ryker's cyber-warriors. Again later, he worked together with fellow cyborg Deathlok, Silver Sable and the Wildpack against the villain group ULTIMATUM.Deathlok vol. 2 #18-21 Coldblood was seen together with Monica Rambeau, Wonder Man, Darkhawk, Dracula, Terror, Sleepwalker and Deathlok held hostage because of the Stranger.Beyond #3 In the 2006-2007 Civil War storyline, Coldblood was one of the many super-heroes against the Superhuman Registration Act, and was arrested.Civil War #3 He is seen being transported to the super-prison 42 built within the Negative Zone, but almost immediately suffers a paralyzing, psychotic break apparently due to the sensory warping effects of this new environment and his own anguish.Civil War: Frontline #5 After being freed during the resistance's exodus, Coldblood is later seen in the background behind Captain America and the others Anti-Registration heroes just before the final confrontation with Iron Man and the Pro-Registration heroes.Mark Millar (w), Steve McNiven (p), Dexter Vines (i). Civil War #6 Marvel Comics. Coldblood then participated during the battle between both sides, and was later referred to being missing in action.Civil War: Battle Damage Report #1 Powers and abilities Eric Savin was converted into the cyborg Coldblood-7 by Dr. Gina Dyson and other Project: Ultra-Tech surgeons following designs by Mako. This gave him superhuman strength, reflexes, speed, stamina, durability, and enhanced sensory systems including night vision. He can see into the infrared. Coldblood also has the ability to interface with virtually any computer system, and, by mentally entering \\"cyberspace\\", to communicate with such systems. He has a wetware-grafted computer grafted to his organic brain, a plasti-steel-reinforced skeleton, an artificial heart, synthetic hemoglobin, and artificial right eye. His legs are clearly cybernetic, while his arms are composed of synthetic skin and muscle over a plasti-steel skeleton. The right half of his face is an armored cybernetic implant. The exact limits of his strength are not known, but he is able to engage effectively in combat with Deathlok; an arguably much more advanced cyborg. His artificial muscles do eventually fatigue, but he can perform at full exertion for many hours without tiring. The organic portions of Coldblood's body still require food, drink, oxygen and sleep; however his artificial blood and organs grant him considerable resistance to diseases and radiation. His in-built computer analyses his sensory input; tracks targets and is capable of seeing through illusions, detecting holograms and so forth. It requires a recharge of electricity every twelve months of active service. The portion of Coldblood's organic brain that accessed his personal memories was removed during surgery that made him into a cyborg. Coldblood wears body armor and uses conventional firearms, including a .357 automatic gun implanted in his artificial left hand. Mako and Project: Ultra-Tech also specially designed a high speed automobile for him, with built-in guns. It can be either remote controlled by a device in Coldblood's left wrist, or automatically by his in-built computer. Coldblood is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, highly trained in commando fighting and is a superb marksman with conventional firearms. In other media James Badge Dale portrays a loose adaption of Eric Savin in the 2013 Marvel Cinematic Universe film Iron Man 3. This version is a former Lieutenant Colonel who is Aldrich Killian's right-hand man, having undergone the Extremis treatment to boost his combat skills and give himself various fire-based powers and a regenerative healing factor. Savin turns Jack Taggart into a human bomb as part of a terrorist attack, using his regenerative powers to survive before leading an assault on Tony Stark's mansion, though they fail to kill Stark. He accompanies Ellen Brandt to Tennessee to recover evidence involving an Extremis test subject, though Stark is able to kill Brandt and fight Savin off. After James Rhodes is captured, Savin uses the Iron Patriot armor to impersonate Rhodes and board Air Force One to kidnap President Matthew Ellis. While he succeeds in this task, Iron Man kills Savin before he can escape. The Iron Man 3 iteration of Eric Savin is featured in the Facebook game Marvel Avengers Alliance. In the 9th Spec Ops mission, Savin steals the Iron Patriot armor as a boss character on the Mandarin's behalf.

Overview Setting a bucky bit changes the output character. A bucky bit allows the user to type a wider variety of characters and commands while maintaining a reasonable number of keys on a keyboard. Some of the keys corresponding to bucky bits on modern keyboards are the alt key, control key, meta key, command key (⌘), super key, and option key. In ASCII, the bucky bit is usually the 8th bit (also known as meta bit). However, in older character representations wider than 8 bits, more high bits could be used as bucky bits. In the modern X Window System, bucky bits are bits 18–23 of an event code. History The term was invented at Stanford and is based on Niklaus Wirth's nickname \\"Bucky\\". Niklaus Wirth was first to suggest an EDIT key to set the eighth bit of a 7-bit ASCII character sometime in 1964 or 1965. Bucky bits were used heavily on keyboards designed by Tom Knight at MIT, including space- cadet keyboards used on LISP machines. These could contain as many as seven modifier keys: SHIFT, CTRL, META, HYPER, SUPER, TOP, and GREEK (also referred to as FRONT). https://web.archive.org/web/20150906080534/http://home.comcast.net/~mmcm/kbd/SpaceCadet.html See also * Knight keyboard References External links * MIT Scheme reference Character encoding Computer keys ","title":"Bucky bit"},{"id":"6398892","text":"The Saint Takes Over, released in 1940 by RKO Pictures, was the fifth of eight films in RKO's film series about Simon Templar, also known as \\"The Saint\\", the Robin Hood-inspired crimefighter created by Leslie Charteris. George Sanders returned as Templar, fourth time as the Saint. Sanders did one more Saint picture the following year, then abandoned the character for good. Wendy Barrie played his latest romantic interest, in her second of three appearances in the Saint film series (playing a different role each time). Plot Lobby card for The Saint Takes Over On an ocean liner making its way to New York, Simon Templar (George Sanders), \\"the Saint\\", rescues a fellow passenger (Wendy Barrie) from card cheats, though she refuses to give him her name and is offended when he kisses her without invitation. He later sends the mysterious woman a rose corsage by way of apology. The Saint learns that his friendly nemesis, Inspector Henry Farnack (Jonathan Hale), has been suspended from the police force after $50,000 was found in his safe. He has been framed by \\"Big\\" Ben Egan (Pierre Watkin) on behalf of his race-fixing gang, which Fernack was investigating. The other members of the gang - \\"Rocky\\" Weldon (Roland Drew), Leo Sloan (Robert Emmett Keane), Sam Reese (Morgan Conway) and Max Bremer (Cy Kendall) - each pay a quarter share of the $90,000 cost of the frameup. Rocky himself has just been cleared in a trial after the testimony of his bodyguard, Clarence \\"Pearly\\" Gates (Paul Guilfoyle) and the murder of the main prosecution witness, Johnny Summers. Egan orders two henchmen to pick up the woman passenger when the ship arrives. Templar is able to foil them, and the woman drives off in a taxi. Templar goes to see Fernack. Weldon sends Gates to rob Egan, but Egan catches the safe cracker. At gunpoint, Gates confesses that Welden sent him. Egan orders him to lure his boss into a trap, but after Gates leaves, an unseen shooter kills Egan. Templar and Fernack meet when they both sneak into Egan's place. The Saint finds the hidden camera and later develops the photograph. He also picks up a clue, a rose petal. Welden assumes Gates killed Egan and has the $90,000, despite Gates' protestations. Templar blackmails Gates into helping him in exchange for not giving the police the photograph and telling Weldon that Gates does not have the money. However, when they go to see Weldon, they find him dead, and once again, Fernack is already there. Templar, assisted by Gates, kidnaps Sloan, the most likely of the survivors to talk, but they are followed. When Templar leaves Sloan guarded by Fernack, Sloan is shot and killed through Fernack's basement window. They take the body back to Sloan's place, but the suspicious police burst in and take them by surprise. Only Templar manages to escape. He waits for the murderer in Reese's apartment (Bremer being out of town). He is unsurprised when the woman shows up. It is his fellow ship passenger Ruth Summers (Wendy Barrie), Johnny's sister, out for revenge. He offers to help her. Templar has Gates \\"betray\\" him to Bremer and Reese. They catch him searching Bremer's office. He offers to trade the $90,000 for his life, but insists they tell him everything. Their unwitting confessions are broadcast to the police via a hidden microphone and radio transmitter. When the police arrive, Bremer escapes by the fire escape. In the alley, he encounters Ruth. Each fatally shoots the other. Ruth makes a deathbed confession to the three previous murders, then dies before Templar can tell her something important.

Auctioneers (RBA), or simply Ritchie Bros., is industrial asset disposition & management company, selling heavy industrial equipment and trucks through live and online auctions, and other transactional channels. The company is headquartered in Burnaby, a suburb of Metro Vancouver, and has operations in 12 countries and 40 auction sites worldwide. The company sells through unreserved public auctions, weekly featured auctions at IronPlanet, and various other online marketplaces, a broad range of used and unused industrial assets, including equipment, trucks and other assets utilized in the construction, transportation, agricultural, material handling, mining, forestry, petroleum, and marine industries. Ritchie Bros.' group of companies and solutions also includes Marketplace-E, an online equipment marketplace; Mascus, an online equipment listing service; GovPlanet, an online marketplace for selling surplus government, military and other public agencies' assets; TruckPlanet, a marketplace for the transportation industry; Kruse Energy, an oil & gas auction company; SalvageSale, online auctions for the insurance industry; Leake Car Auctions, a collector car auction company; and Ritchie Bros. Financial Services, an equipment financing and leasing company. Ritchie Bros. is a public company. Its common shares are traded on the New York and Toronto stock exchanges under the ticker symbol RBA.  History   The Ritchie Brothers  Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers was established in Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada. The three Ritchie brothers – Ken, John and Dave Ritchie – took over the OK Used Furniture Store from their father in 1955. They entered the auction business in 1958 when they needed CA$2,000 to pay a bank debt on short notice. A friend suggested they conduct an auction to get rid of some surplus inventory from the furniture store. They conducted their first auction at the Scout Hall in Kelowna in 1958 and discovered a new way of doing business. Starting with that first auction at the Scout Hall, Ritchie Bros. maintained a strict policy of conducting unreserved auctions – meaning there were no minimum bids and no reserve prices. The brothers also established a policy of not allowing bid-ins or buybacks by the sellers.Jeffrey L. Rodengen, The Legend of Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers (Write Stuff Enterprises Inc., 2004) The brothers began conducting auctions more regularly and in 1958 incorporated Ritchie Bros. Auction Galleries Ltd. to formalize their new business. Ritchie Bros. began selling used equipment in the 1960s. In 1963 Dave Ritchie moved to Vancouver, B.C. and rented an auction site on S.E. Marine Drive. He set up the company's first equipment auction in Vancouver shortly after. The Ritchie brothers conducted their first major unreserved industrial auction in Radium Hot Springs, British Columbia on June 7, 1963. They sold CA$663,000 of equipment in one day – by far the largest auction in the company's history. The success of the Radium Hot Springs auction convinced the brothers that they could make more money auctioning used equipment than selling furniture, so they sold their furniture store in Kelowna and went into the auction business full-time. Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers established one of the trademarks of its auctions at the Radium Hot Springs auction. It was raining on the day of the auction. Instead of making the bidders walk around in the rain during the auction, they set up the auction under the eaves of a nearby shop and drove the equipment in to be sold piece by piece. The crowd stayed dry and the ramp-and-stage method became a fixture at Ritchie Bros. auctions thereafter.  50 years of unreserved industrial auctions  On June 7, 2013, Ritchie Bros. celebrated 50 years since the company's first major unreserved industrial auction in Radium Hot Springs, British Columbia. It was at this Radium Hot Springs auction that Ritchie Bros. adopted the ramp-and-stage approach for selling all mobile equipment. This approach involves a staging area —designed as a ramp— located in front of a viewing theater, where bidders sit waiting for mobile equipment to come to “center stage.” Each piece of equipment is numbered and, once it comes to rest at the center of the ramp, the auctioneer begins asking for bids. The crowd of bidders signals their bid increments to roving “bid catchers,” who in turn signal the auctioneer when a bid is made. The auctioneer increases the call price until there are no more bids being placed. At a Ritchie Bros. auction, bids are called until no more are forthcoming in approximately one minute, when the auctioneer calls that the item has been “sold!” to the highest bidder. The Company has pioneered the ramp-and-stage method and unreserved industrial auctions around the world ever since the auction at Radium Hot Springs on June 7, 1963.  The early auction years  Most of the company's earliest auctions were held in British Columbia. Ritchie Bros. began expanding into other parts of Canada in the mid-1960s, conducting its first auctions in Alberta (in 1964), the Yukon (1964), Saskatchewan (1965), Manitoba (1968), and other parts of Eastern Canada shortly thereafter. In 1965, Ken Ritchie left the company to spend more time with his family and the company's name was changed from Ritchie Bros. Auction Galleries Ltd. to Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Ltd. Ken established his own auction company, but returned to work with his brothers in 1968. He stayed with Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers until 1980. In 1968, Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers held its first auction with gross proceeds in excess of CA$1 million, in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Edmonton was also the site of the company's first permanent auction site (on company-owned land), which was established in 1976. Until then, Ritchie Bros. had been conducting its auctions on leased land.  Expansion in the U.S.  Ritchie Bros. established its first presence outside Canada in 1969 when it became incorporated in Washington, USA. The company held its first auction outside Canada in 1970, in Beaverton, Oregon, and gradually began expanding throughout the United States. In 1974, John Ritchie left the company, selling his share of the business to his brother Dave. In 1975, Dave Ritchie – the sole company shareholder – decided to sell partnerships in Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers to some of his key employees: Dick Bartel, C. Russell (“Russ”) Cmolik, Ken Ritchie, and Bill Gronberg. Over the coming years, the partnership expanded to include Bob Carswell, Marvin Chantler, Ed Banser, Roger Rummel, Bob Brawley, Ken Asbury, John Wild, Marty Pope, Mark Clarke, Don Chalmers, Sylvain Touchette, Frank McFadden, and Mike Ritchie. When Ritchie Bros. went public in 1998, Ken Ritchie and Bill Gronberg no longer owned shares in the company. By 1985, Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers had sold more than US$1 billion of equipment through unreserved auctions. It took only three more years for the company to gross another US$1 billion in sales.  International expansion  In the late 1980s Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers began to look overseas for further growth opportunities. The company conducted its first auctions outside North America in 1987, in Liverpool, the U.K., and Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The equipment sold at the Liverpool auction had been used to rebuild the Falkland Islands following the war there. Further international expansion followed with the company's first auctions in Australia (1990), Mexico (1995), the Middle East (1997), Africa (2003), China (2013), and Finland (2013). In 1991, the company achieved another milestone when it conducted its 1,000th unreserved auction. It conducted its 2,000th auction in the year 2000.  The role of technology  In 1989, Ritchie Bros. became the first industrial auction company to enable remote bidding via video when it broadcast its Edmonton auction live at the Agricom trade show in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Video simulcasts were held at trade shows in 1993 and 1995, followed in 1997 by a three-way videoconferenced auction that linked separate auction sites in St. Paul, Minnesota; Kansas City, Missouri; and Clinton, Wisconsin. Equipment was located at all three sites, and interested buyers could bid at any of the sites, which were linked via video. The company launched its website, rbauction.com, at the ConExpo trade show in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA in 1996. The site featured a searchable database that enabled customers to see all of the equipment being sold in upcoming Ritchie Bros. auctions. In March 1999, Ritchie Bros. broadcast an auction over the Internet for the first time. In March 2002, Ritchie Bros. introduced its real-time Internet bidding service. In 2016, Ritchie Bros. launched its mobile app, allowing people to search, find and bid on equipment via mobile devices. In 2018, the company launched RB Asset Solutions, a cloud-based asset management and disposition system with a complete inventory management system, data analytics and dashboards, e-commerce sites, and other functions.  Going public  In 1998, the year that Ritchie Bros. went public, the company's annual gross auction proceeds exceeded US$1 billion for the first time ever.March 31, 1999 Annual Report – English Annual Report. Sedar. 2008-09-09. Its common shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol RBA in March 1998, followed by listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange in April 2004.  Network of auction sites  Investing in permanent auction sites has been a company priority since the 1970s. Ritchie Bros. opened its first permanent auction site in Nisku (Edmonton), Alberta, Canada in 1976. Before going public in 1998, the company opened additional permanent auction sites in Vancouver, B.C. (in 1979); Prince George, B.C. (1980); Denver, Colorado (1985) – the first site in the U.S.; Phoenix, Arizona (1987); Toronto, Ontario (1988); Tampa, Florida (1995); Atlanta, Georgia (1996); Minneapolis, Minnesota (1991); Houston, Texas (1993); Fort Worth, Texas (1994); Olympia, Washington (1994); and Halifax, Nova Scotia (1997).April 6, 1998 Long Form Prospectus – English Company Documents.

It is the U.S. Air Force component to Joint Special Operations Command. It is garrisoned at Pope Field, North Carolina. Mission The 24th STS provides special operations airmen for the Joint Special Operations Command, including Pararescuemen, Combat Controllers, Special Reconnaissance, and Tactical Air Control Party personnel. They are the Air Force's Tier 1 unit, and 24th STS members are provided as enablers to the Army's 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment- Delta (a.k.a. Delta Force) and the Navy's Special Warfare Development Group, or DEVGRU (a.k.a. SEAL Team 6) due to their specific skill sets. As such, 24th STS members are also trained in conducting classified and clandestine operations such as direct action, counter-terrorism, counter-insurgency, hostage rescue, and special reconnaissance. History World War II The first predecessor of the squadron was activated at Hamilton Field in October 1941 to be the director unit for the 24th Pursuit Group, which was formed simultaneously at Clark Field, Philippines as the headquarters for pursuit squadrons of the Philippine Department Air Force. After completing training, the squadron sailed on the on 6 December 1941. However, due to the Japanese attacks on Pearl Harbor and Clark Field, the President Garfield returned to port on 10 December and the squadron returned to Hamilton Field. Although nominally assigned to the 24th Group from January though October 1942, the squadron served with air defense forces on the Pacific coast until it was disbanded on 31 March 1944 when the Army Air Forces converted its units in the US from rigid table of organization units to more flexible base units. Its personnel and equipment were transferred to the 411th AAF Base Unit (Fighter Wing) at Berkeley, California. Special operations The 24th Special Tactics Squadron participated in the United States invasion of Panama in 1989. The 24th STS deployed 11 personnel including the unit commander, Lt. Col. Jim Oeser, as part of JSOC's Task Force Ranger during Operation Restore Hope in 1993. Due to their actions during the Battle of Mogadishu multiple decorations were awarded to the airmen. Pararescueman (PJ) TSgt Tim Wilkinson received the Air Force Cross and fellow PJ MSgt Scott Fales received the Silver Star, both for providing lifesaving medical care to wounded soldiers. Combat Controller (CCT) SSgt. Jeffrey W. Bray also received the Silver Star for coordinating helicopter attack runs throughout the night around their positions. From 15 to 20 September 2000 the 24th STS with the 23rd Special Tactics Squadron took part in the annual Canadian military exercise, Search and Rescue Exercise (SAREX). This was the first time Special Tactics units took part in SAREX. In recent years the squadron has been heavily involved in combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan where the unit was part of the JSOC groupings Task Force 121, Task Force 6-26 and Task Force 145. In 2003 members of the unit were involved in two combat jumps in the initial phases of the Iraq War alongside the 3rd Ranger Battalion. The first combat jump was on 24 March 2003 near the Syrian border in the Iraqi town of Al Qaim where they secured a small desert landing strip to allow follow-on coalition forces into the area. The second combat jump was two days later near Haditha, Iraq, where they secured the Haditha Dam. On 8 April 2003 Combat Controller Scott Sather, a member of the 24th STS, became the first airman killed in combat in Operation Iraqi Freedom near Tikrit, Iraq. He was attached to a small team from the 75th Ranger Regimental Reconnaissance Detachment (RRD). The RRD team and Sather were operating alongside Delta Force, under Lieutenant Colonel Pete Blaber, west of Baghdad. They were tasked with deceiving the Iraqi army into believing the main U.S. invasion was coming from the west in order to prevent Saddam Hussein from escaping into Syria. Sather Air Base was named after him. The 24th STS was a part of JSOC's Task Force 145 which was a provisional grouping specifically charged with hunting down high-value al-Qaeda and Iraqi leadership including Al-Qaeda in Iraq leader, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who was killed in June 2006. The squadron lost three members – PJs John Brown and Daniel Zerbe and CCT Andrew Harvell – in 2011 when the Chinook in which they were flying was shot down in Afghanistan. To honor the three 24th STS members who died in the 2011 Chinook shootdown, 18 members of AFSOC marched 800 miles from Lackland Air Force Base, San Antonio Texas to Hurlburt Field, Florida in their memory.

J. W. Dam, with Lyrics by Dam and Adrian Ross and music by Ivan Caryll, and additional numbers by Lionel Monckton and Ross. It premiered at the Gaiety Theatre in London in 1894 and ran for an extremely successful 546 performances. Its cast included Seymour Hicks, George Grossmith, Jr., Arthur Williams, Edmund Payne, and Ellaline Terriss. It soon played in New York and was successfully revived in London in 1920. Background The success of A Gaiety Girl in 1893 confirmed to Edwardes that the lighter \\"musical comedy\\" was the right path for musical theatre. The Shop Girl heralded a new era in musical comedy, and the critics were amazed that the author had provided such a coherent story, as there had been hardly any story at all in burlesque. Over a dozen copies followed at the Gaiety Theatre (including My Girl, The Circus Girl, and A Runaway Girl) over the next two decades and were widely imitated by other producers and playwriting teams. They also led to the next level of sophistication in the integrated musical comedy at Daly's Theatre and elsewhere in London. Productions The Shop Girl was first produced by George Edwardes at the Gaiety Theatre in London, opening on 24 November 1894. The piece ran for an extremely successful 546 performances, transferring to Daly's Theatre.\\"The Shop Girl at The Gaiety\\", Freeman's Journal, 13 March 1896, p. 5 It starred Seymour Hicks, George Grossmith, Jr., Arthur Williams, Edmund Payne, Willie Warde and Ada Reeve, who (being pregnant) was replaced in the cast by Kate Cutler and then Hicks' wife, Ellaline Terriss. Topsy Sinden danced in the piece. Direction was by James T. Tanner, with choreography by Warde. Costumes were by C. Wilhelm. The piece achieved immediate popularity and introduced to London audiences a cleaner, more respectable form of musical comedy than the previous \\"musical farces\\", which had been more closely related to burlesque.Hollingshead, pp. 72–73 Indeed, during the run of the show, some of the racier lines were removed, as Edwardes recognised that the future of musicals lay in appealing to the respectable Victorian audience. In addition, at Hicks' urging, the romantic couple was designed as less sentimental and more mischievous and light hearted. But it was not lacking in sex appeal. It was the first show to feature Edwardes' Gaiety Girls, who were to feature in all of his similar musical comedies. Caryll, the music director at the Gaiety, conducted the performances of the piece himself. One of the most famous songs from the show was \\"Her golden hair was hanging down her back.\\" As the run went on, songs were constantly changed and new business frequently introduced, especially when there were cast changes. This also began a pattern for musicals of the era. Hicks and Grossmith transferred with the production to Broadway in 1895, under the management of Charles Frohman. Connie Ediss and Bertie Wright joined the cast. The New York production of The Shop Girl opened at Palmer's Theatre on October 28, 1895 and played for 72 performances. Hicks and Alfred Butt revived the piece in London in 1920, at the Gaiety, where it was again a hit, running for 327 performances. Hicks directed and Warde choreographed. The cast included Evelyn Laye and Roy Royston. Synopsis An attractive and charming London shop girl, Bessie Brent, is in love with Charles Appleby, a poor, but lively medical student from a good family. She also meets a good-hearted millionaire, John Brown, who had gone out in the steerage of a liner, \\"to become a miner\\", and had struck it rich in Colorado. The millionaire has come back to London to look for the daughter of his mining chum, to whom a fortune of four million pounds was due. She is to be identified by a birthmark. The daughter, of course, turns out to be the shop girl and, after a few misunderstandings, she agrees to marry her sweetheart.

Retrieved 21 December 2012. The mutton, usually in the form of shanks or legs (kjógv or bógv in Faroese, depending on which leg it is), is allowed to hang in a so-called hjallur, a drying shed ventilated by the wind, for five to nine months. It has a very strong smell, which may upset those who are not accustomed to it. The hanging process covers three stages, or hjeldene, each causing the meat to have different consistencies, smells and tastes. The first, visnaður, occurs after just a few days, but lamb and mutton are not eaten after such a short period. The second stage, ræstur, is of less predictable length, and provides dried meat suitable for eating without cooking. In reaching the final stage, turrur, cold weather can on occasion virtually eliminate the typical smell with a resulting weakening of taste. If, however, the weather is warm and wet during the first period, the fermentation process can cause the meat to decay, giving it too strong a taste. There can therefore be variations in taste from year to year, but this is not usually a problem. A much more serious problem is infestation by flies. For this reason, the drying sheds used to be placed next to streams or the sea in order to diminish the arrival of flies. When the skerpikjøt is ready, it is cut into thin slices and eaten on rye bread in the form of an open faced sandwich.\\"Kjøt\\" . Imgur.com. Retrieved 21 December 2012.

For his support for his successful court theatre he was also known as the Theaterherzog (theatre duke). Family and early life Georg was the only son of Bernhard II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen and his wife Princess Marie Frederica of Hesse-Kassel. His birth on 2 April 1826 was met with great relief as the succession to the duchy was in jeopardy due to a lack of male heirs in the family. Georg remained an only child for seventeen years, until the birth of his sister Princess Augusta in 1843.Koller, p. 30. mark depicting Georg II, 1908. Georg spent his first few years under the supervision of his parents and grandmother the Dowager Duchess Luise Eleonore. It was the latter who instilled upon Georg the patriotic virtues of his heritage, as well as the sense of duty needed to rule a duchy. In 1862, his only sister married Prince Moritz of Saxe-Altenburg, a younger son of Georg, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg. They would be the parents of Ernst II, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg, the last reigning Duke of Saxe-Altenburg. Duke of Saxe-Meiningen Georg succeeded his father as Duke of Saxe-Meiningen on 20 September 1866, when Bernhard was forced to abdicate in favor of his son following the defeat of Austria in the Austro-Prussian War. In opposition to his father, Georg had sided with the Prussians during the war and was rewarded with a position of Lieutenant General of the Prussian army. The young duke was familiar enough with Prussian politics to regard their attitudes as impractical. During the Franco-Prussian War, Georg led two regiments of soldiers from Meiningen and had the honor of capturing the first French flags at the Battle of Froeschweiler. Notably, he fought in nearly every battle during the war. Georg was a member of Wilhelm I's staff when he entered Paris and remained a friend of the Emperor until the latter's death in 1888. Marriages First Charlotte of Prussia (artist unknown). Georg was married firstly in Charlottenburg on 18 May 1850 to the Princess Charlotte of Prussia.Koller, p. 50. She was the eldest daughter of Prince Albert of Prussia and Princess Marianne of the Netherlands, and was a granddaughter of both Frederick William III of Prussia and William I of the Netherlands. They had four children: *Bernhard III, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen (1 April 1851 – 16 January 1928). he married Princess Charlotte of Prussia on 18 February 1878. They had one daughter, Princess Feodora of Saxe-Meiningen. *Prince Georg Albrecht (12 April 1852 – 27 January 1855). died at two years old. *Princess Marie Elisabeth of Saxe-Meiningen (23 September 1853 – 22 February 1923). *unnamed son (29 March – 30 March 1855). died at a day old. Although couple had a short engagement, it was a love match. Among the wedding gifts was an opulent old villa on Lake Como from her mother Marianne. It was renamed the Villa Carlotta in the bride's honor. They spent the next five years in Berlin and Potsdam but returned to Meiningen for the birth of their children. On 27 January 1855, their second son Georg died. Charlotte would follow him two month later, dying in childbirth and leaving Georg inconsolable.Koller, p. 51. He succeeded his father as Duke of Saxe-Meiningen in 1866, eleven years after Charlotte's death. Second Georg's second wife Princess Feodora of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, c. 1860. Portrait by Franz Xaver Winterhalter Despite his recent widowhood, Georg went on a search for a new wife, if only to provide a mother for his two young children. Georg met his second cousin Princess Feodora of Hohenlohe-Langenburg while he was on his way to Italy; they became engaged almost at once.Koller, pp. 51–53. She was a niece of Queen Victoria, being a daughter of Victoria's half-sister Princess Feodora of Leiningen and her husband Ernst I, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg. On 23 October 1858, they married at Langenburg. Georg and Feodora had three sons: *Prince Ernst Bernhard of Saxe-Meiningen (27 September 1859 – 29 December 1941) he married Katharina Jensen on 20 September 1892. They have six children. *Prince Frederick Johann of Saxe-Meiningen (12 October 1861 – 23 August 1914) he married Countess Adelaide of Lippe-Biesterfeld on 24 April 1889. They have six children. *Prince Viktor of Saxe-Meiningen (14 May – 17 May 1865). Their marriage was unhappy however. Georg had never become reconciled to Charlotte's death and Feodora was not temperamentally suited for the life she was expected to lead.Koller, p. 53. She had no intellectual or artistic attainments; even worse, she had no interest in developing any. Despite this fact, Georg attempted to educate her, as he was a great lover of the arts, especially theater. Her mother approved, stating it was \\"very sensible of him indeed to arrange for his bride to be much occupied with lessons, to take drawing lessons, and to hear lectures on history\\". Georg soon realized however that she would never be as witty and clever as Charlotte. After the death of their third son, Feodora stayed away from Meiningen for as much as decently possible. In 1866, he succeeded as Duke of Saxe-Meiningen, making her \\"Duchess consort of Saxe-Meiningen\\". Feodora contracted scarlet fever in January 1872, and died the following month. Despite the many differences between them, Georg had remained fond of her; when she became sick, he was genuinely distraught and sent telegrams to her parents twice daily. Third Georg's third wife Ellen Franz, c. 1870. Portrait by Oskar Begas He was married thirdly and unequally in Liebenstein on 18 March 1873 to Ellen Franz, a former actress. She was given her own style, being known as Helene, \\"Baroness von Holdburg\\" shortly before their wedding and after their marriage. This marriage was morganatic, and greatly angered Kaiser Wilhelm. Georg in turn became increasingly angry and defensive at anyone who failed to recognize his wife and treat her as an equal. Most Germans supported Georg's decision to marry, but Wilhelm felt particularly upset because Georg's first wife had been a kinswoman of his. Wilhelm was not the only one who objected to the marriage; Georg's father ex-Duke Bernhard was equally angry and threatened to appeal directly to the people with the mistaken view that they would support his opinion. Officials and ministers of the Saxe-Meiningen court also objected to the match. Many resigned their offices and their wives openly insulted Ellen. The army also refused to salute her, further angering Duke Georg. He sent an emissary to Berlin with a complaint to Wilhelm, who responded by ordering that all officers must in the future salute Ellen as Baroness von Heldburg. She was never styled as \\"Duchess of Saxe-Meiningen\\" like his second wife. The couple had no children. Well loved by the people, she and Duke Georg created and developed the progressive Meiningen Theater. Relationship to theatre and music  Meiningen Ensemble  After the Franco-Prussian War, Georg devoted himself to theatre. He was one of the greatest intellectuals among the higher nobility during the German Empire. He is particularly known for developing the Meiningen Ensemble using his court theatre. Using his knowledge of art history and his drawing skills, he designed highly detailed, historically accurate scenery, costumes, and properties. In addition, he choreographed large crowd scenes that stunned audiences across Europe. He and his ensemble toured Europe extensively, and had a profound effect on theatre production across the continent. There is no doubt that Realism saw the development of the director as a separate entity, someone with an eye to oversee, someone responsible for the overall conception, interpretation, style and detail of the theatrical performance. The Meiningen Ensemble from its roots in the late 1830s under the directorships of Georg II and Ludwig Chronegk, proceeded to develop a theatre company bereft of theatre-managers and the star system. A system centered on realistic acting and staging and well-developed 'unified' productions. The Ensemble which began as a court theatre but started touring in 1874, used detailed research of people, locations, costumes and set, along with highly choreographed and individually detailed crowd scenes, to create productions which were esthetically unified and realistic in their presentations. In an article for the Deutsche Bühne, the Duke outlined his principles for directing a play, the most important were the creation of a Stage Picture (the pictorial effect created by the synthesis of the actors with the set and props), historical exactitude in the mise en scene, an acting style which used Precise Gestural and Vocal Imitation, the use of Period or Authentic Clothing and Costumes and the use of Group Orchestration by precise planning and direction of all group and crowd scenesEckersley, p. 7. The initial aim of the Meiningen Ensemble was to create, within the context of an ensemble, historical exactitude of the mise en scene. The Meiningen company sought to create the illusion of natural space within the confines of the proscenium arch. Duke Georg was concerned mainly with creating a naturalistic illusory atmosphere where the actor could establish or re-create authenticity in performance. Chronegk and the Duke prepared sketches and diagrams showing actors how to walk and move in period clothing to achieve a naturalistic feel to stage characterization. The Meiningen productions influenced playwrights like Henrik Ibsen, actors like Henry Irving and directors like Antoine and Stanislavsky. The conventions of realism for the Meiningen seemed to create the means by which a theatre artist creates the illusion of everyday life. They saw that art should copy science by depicting life 'as it is' without direct comment, interpretation and the structural edifice of the well made play. The Duke believed that a lifelike reality was achieved on stage through a careful study of the play and showing this in stage movement, composition and stage business. His major contribution to the stage was not just his use of realistic settings and costumes but in the way he tried to use and integrate performers as part of the mise en scene.Eckersley, p. 8. The use of costume did not merely reflect historical accuracy but attempted to help actors perform in a style and mode which integrated with other elements. He demanded that all the actors were at most rehearsals and he carefully worked out the actions of even everyone in crowd scenes. Individual members of crowds and main actors alike were expected to provide specific research and character analysis related to the events depicted on stage. He was known for his great vision and memory and he often worked without a prompt book or script, working from his head and using a runner to ferry his ideas to his assistant Chronegk.Eckersley, p. 16. Because his work toured extensively from 1874-1890, Meiningen's unified productions had a great impact on the theatre world. He is widely considered the theatre's first Modern director.  Meiningen Court Orchestra  The Duke was also the patron of one of Europe's leading orchestras, the Meiningen Court Orchestra. The orchestra attained its distinction after the Duke hired the conductor Hans von Bülow in 1880. Bülow instituted stringent rehearsal methods and, with the Duke's agreement, hired eight musicians, raising its membership to 44. He offered the orchestra as a trial ensemble to Johannes Brahms, who was to try out his Second Piano Concerto and Third Symphony with the orchestra and premiered his Fourth Symphony there, conducting it himself. A dispute with Brahms over who was to conduct the premiere of his Fourth Symphony in Frankfurt led Bülow to resign (he was scheduled to premiere it there, but Brahms pre-empted him by conducting it with a local orchestra). Bülow was succeeded briefly by his 20-year-old assistant Richard Strauss, who resigned after a month, and then by Fritz Steinbach. Steinbach championed the music of Brahms, instituting Brahms Festivals in 1895 and 1897 in Meiningen with the composer present. A private concert by the Meiningen Court Orchestra and Steinbach for Brahms in 1891 led the composer to notice the artistry of the ensemble's first clarinetist, Richard Mühlfeld; Brahms promised to compose music for Mühlfeld, and did indeed compose his Clarinet Trio, Clarinet Quintet, and two Clarinet Sonatas. In 1897 the Duke undertook the construction of a Brahms monument in Meiningen's English gardens, sculpted by Adolf von Hildebrand. Later life In his later life, Georg suffered from acute deafness and retired from active life. He had been fond of hunting and traveling, and was a collector of antiques and manuscripts. He died on 25 June 1914 at Bad Wildungen and was succeeded by his eldest son Bernhard. Georg is buried at ', next to his third wife.

The film continued the screen adventures of the Robin Hood- inspired anti-hero, Simon Templar, alias \\"The Saint\\", created by Leslie Charteris. This sequel was based upon a story by Charteris; however, many changes to his concept were made. Charteris later novelised his version of the film story as the novella \\"Palm Springs\\", contained within the 1942 collection The Saint Goes West. This was the sixth of eight in RKO's film series about The Saint. The central cast was identical to the previous entry, The Saint Takes Over. George Sanders returned as Templar (his final performance in the role), with Jonathan Hale making his own final appearance as Inspector Farnack. (The character would next be seen in The Saint in Manhattan, a 1980s television pilot.) Wendy Barrie makes her third and final appearance, once again playing a different character, as does Paul Guilfoyle, reprising the role of Clarence \\"Pearly\\" Gates from the previous film. The storyline involves The Saint pursuing rare stamps at a Palm Springs, California hotel. Plot Simon Templar is asked by his friend, Inspector Farnack, to protect Peter Johnson, a man trying to transport a cache of rare stamps from New York City to his niece Elna, a tennis pro for a hotel in Palm Springs, California. In an attempted robbery, Simon strikes an unseen assailant in the face with his \\"Saint\\" ring. On the train west, Simon is introduced to Margaret Forbes, who will be a guest at the Palm Springs hotel. There the stamps are stolen from Templar, so Simon employs his pal, pickpocket \\"Pearly\\" Gates, to steal belongings from every other hotel guest. The stamps are found in a pillbox, but Pearly doesn't know who he took it from. Simon sets a trap for the thief at the hotel, where Elna is accosted at gunpoint by Margaret, who turns out to be a foreign agent. Simon sets another trap at Joshua Tree National Park, where another hotel guest is revealed to be the mastermind of the plot to steal the stamps. Templar tricks him into confessing the earlier murders, and the mark from Simon's ring on his face is additional proof of his guilt.

The bulb was then secured by twine or a rubber band. The baby's saliva would slowly dissolve the sugar in the bulb. In use the exposed outfolded fabric could give the appearance of a flower in the baby's mouth. David Ransel quotes a Russian study by Dr. N. E.

Background and education The son of Burrell Hammond, a farmer in Briston, Norfolk, Hammond was educated at Gresham's School and Downing College, Cambridge. He was named after his grandfather, another John Hammond, who was both a farmer and a veterinarian and one of the founders of the Red Poll herdbook in the 1870s. Career Hammond arrived at Downing as an undergraduate in 1907 and for most of his career was a Fellow of the College. He also headed the School of Physiology of Animal Reproduction of the University of Cambridge and was a founder of the Cambridge Animal Research Station. Hammond conducted classical studies on embryo survival in the early 1920s. His famous study Rate of Intra-uterine Growth (1938) showed that crossbred foetal foals grew at the rate of their dams' pure breed. He was the first to crystallise the theory of metabolic rate-dependent prioritising of nutrient partitioning between tissues. He was also the first to report the duration of oestrus for lactating cows (19.3 hours) and heifers (16.1 hours). He studied closely the major changes in animal shape resulting from the domestication and selective breeding of farm animals. With Arthur Walton, Hammond was one of the pioneers of artificial insemination ('AI'). As he couldn't practice certain AI techniques in England, because of religious and cultural taboos, Hammond sponsored work in other countries where such limitations did not apply. He sent a colleague, Dr Luis Thomasset, to Russia to work on AI with the Soviets. He himself introduced AI to other countries, such as Argentina. His book The Artificial Insemination of Cattle (1947) was the first comprehensive publication on AI published in England. Hammond founded the British Cattle Breeders Club in 1946 and was an active member in the early days of the European Association for Animal Production, serving on its Preparatory Committee. He ended his life as the guru of the British livestock world and is widely regarded as the father of modern animal physiology. His two sons, John Hammond, Jr., and Christopher Hammond (who died in 2002), followed him in his work. Publications *Rate of Intra-uterine Growth by J. Hammond and A.

From the beginning of his career, he broadened the range of styles and techniques used by Yoshida family artists.  Family His father and mother, Hiroshi Yoshida and Fujio Yoshida, were both leading Western-style artists in Tokyo in oils, watercolors, and from 1925 in shin- hanga woodblock prints. Hodaka's older brother, Tōshi Yoshida, became the heir to the Yoshida Studio and worked in both oils and woodblock prints. Hodaka was supposed to become a scientist, but as the Second World War ended, he defied his father's plans and became, not only an artist, but one who focused on abstraction, a style his father disdained. (Skibbe, 11-12) Unlike others in the family, Hodaka's art is quite complex, with an \\"edgy\\" feel to it. (Robertson, 114)  Analysis of his work  Instead of having a straight line development, his work moved forward in a series of abrupt stages. For example, his 1955 encounter in Mexico with primitive Pre-Columbian artifacts and architecture radically reoriented his art. A survey of the total range of his work - about 600 prints over 45 years - reveals distinct periods, each having major changes in subject matter, vocabulary, style, and color palette. His styles, while always his own, drew from Expressionism, Pop, Photorealism, and Color Field abstraction. (Allen, et al., 114-119) Broadly speaking most of his prints would be categorized as sōsaku-hanga. Main periods: 1950-53 Early Prints - simple modern observations of nature and human nature 1953-54 Buddhist Prints - modern reformulations of traditional Japanese material culture 1955-63 Primitive Prints - abstractions of the primitive in Pre- Columbian forms 1963-66 Folk Prints (Transition A) - witty perspectives on indigenous South American culture 1966-74 Mythology and Landscape Prints - Pop art exposé of modern culture in decline 1974-79 House and Nude Prints (Transition B) - the tension aroused by premodern/modern 1979-84 FMC House Prints - the basic human element in houses from various cultures 1984-91 Recollection Prints (Transition C) - noting old and distressed objects 1991-95 Wall Prints - the human story on the surfaces of old walls The print technology Hodaka used was not limited to woodblock, but included monoprinting, wood engraving, copper etching, silkscreen, lithograph, and often employed photo-transfer techniques. In this regard he was a pioneer in Japan in the 1960s and 70's. (Allen, et al., 114-117) His subject matter was drawn from objects in cultures all around the world. In spite of these various dynamics, each of Hodaka's periods is an exploration in the same basic direction, into what might be called modernist expressions of primitive human vitality. (Robertson, 114; Skibbe, 47-49) Individual prints show great artistry in composition and color.  Modernist  In Chapter One of his book, A Fine Disregard: What Makes Modern Art Modern, 1990, Kirk Varnedoe says that modern art has four basic characteristics: (1) the flattened image instead of the illusion of space, (2) fragmentation and repetition in the composition, rather than the complete object, (3) primitivism, in the sense of an artifact revealing something latent deep within ourselves, and (4) the flight of the mind, the freedom to assume any point of departure, or to conceptualize as one wishes. Hodaka’s art exemplifies all four characteristics, and he did this without suppressing his Japanese aesthetic sensibility. Hodaka clearly was a modern Japanese internationalist, and as such he broadened the artistic heritage of the Yoshida family. (www.hodakayoshidaprints.com) He exhibited mainly in major international art biennials. Hodaka received many awards and prizes, including the Purple Ribbon Decoration bestowed by the Emperor in 1990, and the Order of the Rising Sun, Fourth class, awarded by the Emperor posthumously in 1995. (Skibbe, 20) Hodaka's wife, Chizuko Yoshida, née Inoue, (1924-) and their daughter Ayomi Yoshida (1958-) are both artists, and their son Takasuke (1959-) is an art jewelry maker.

Previously, Liberty Records had used \\"The T-Bones\\" as a group name for instrumentals recorded by Los Angeles session musicians The Wrecking Crew, and Liberty told Pell to use it again for his project.

When the single became a hit, Liberty Records needed the T-Bones to go on the road to promote it, but the original session musicians weren't willing to go.

He played college football at the University of Alabama. College career Humphrey played from 1985 to 1988 for the Crimson Tide. During his freshman year, he would share the backfield with Gene Jelks and Kerry Goode. He would rush for 502 yards, on 99 carries, and 4 touchdowns. During his sophomore year, he led the Crimson Tide in rushing with 1,471 yards and scored 15 touchdowns. The season ended on Christmas Day in the Sun Bowl against the Washington Huskies. Humphrey scored three touchdowns, and the Tide finished with a 10-3 record. He was named to an All-American team. In 1987, Bobby Humphrey was once again the featured back for the Tide. Rushing for 1,255 yards on 238 carries, and 11 touchdowns. One of the highlights of his junior year, was a 220-yard rushing performance against Penn State. On Halloween night, against Mississippi State he would pass Johnny Musso as Alabama's all-time leading rusher. Alabama would finish the year in the 1988 Hall of Fame Bowl, where Humphrey would score two touchdowns in a losing effort. He was once again named to an All-American team, and finished tenth in the Heisman Trophy voting. During spring practice, he would break his left foot. He started his senior season against Temple, scoring a touchdown. But two weeks later, he would break his foot again ending his college career. He finished with 3,420 rushing yards and 33 touchdowns. At the end of his college career, no Alabama running back had more 200 yard rushing games, with four, and more 100 yard rushing games, with sixteen, than Bobby Humphrey. In his four seasons playing for the Crimson Tide, Humphrey rushed for 3,420 yards (a school record at the time), caught 60 passes for 523 yards, and scored 40 touchdowns. He made the College Football All-America Team in 1986 and 1987. In 1986, he set a school record with 1,471 rushing yards. In 1987, he was voted as UPI's offensive player of the year and finished 10th in the Heisman Trophy balloting. NFL career Humphrey was one of five players selected in the 1989 NFL Supplemental Draft, selected in the first round by the Denver Broncos. During his rookie season, he rushed for 1,151 yards and seven touchdowns for the Broncos; he also threw a 17-yard touchdown pass and hauled in a touchdown reception. The Broncos qualified for Super Bowl XXIV, but were defeated 55-10 by the San Francisco 49ers. Humphrey, although finishing the game as the Broncos leader in both rushing (61 yards) and receiving (31 yards), had a key turnover in the first quarter when he fumbled near midfield. Following this fumble, the 49ers would score 34 unanswered points to put the game away. He followed his rookie season with a Pro Bowl selection in 1990, rushing for 1,202 yards and seven touchdowns in 1990. Humphrey was the first Denver Bronco to rush for 1,000 yards in back-to-back seasons. In 1991, Humphrey held out of training camp in hopes of obtaining a new contract. The Broncos, by team policy, refused to renegotiate his pay and the holdout continued late into the season. Unable to secure a new contract, Humphrey finally ended his holdout in week 14. However, by that time, newly signed Gaston Green had emerged as the team's starting running back and was on his way to completing his own 1,000-yard season. Furthermore, Humphrey had fallen out of favor with the team's coaching and front office as a result of the holdout. When Humphrey returned in week 14, he was out of shape and given only a reserve role in the Broncos' offense. He remained on the bench as Denver made a run to the AFC Championship Game, losing to the Buffalo Bills 10-7. The following offseason, Humphrey was traded to the Miami Dolphins in exchange for running back Sammie Smith. He played for the Dolphins in 1992 scoring only one rushing touchdown and running for 471 yards; he also finished with 507 receiving yards and a touchdown reception. With his new team, Humphrey returned to the AFC Championship Game for the second consecutive season, losing again to the Buffalo Bills. After being out of football for two seasons, Humphrey attempted a comeback in 1995 with the Bills, but failed to make the team. Arena football coaching career In August 1999, the Birmingham Steeldogs formed as part of a new indoor football league called AF2, a developmental league for the Arena Football League. Humphrey, with no coaching experience at that level, was named Head Coach. Over the course of six seasons, Humphrey guided the Steeldogs to a 51-50 record. After a disappointing 2-14 season, Humphrey was dismissed in 2005. The Steeldogs would rename themselves as the Alabama Steeldogs one year later, before ceasing operations following the 2007 season. The league would fold in 2009. Humphrey, at the time of his dismissal, was the second winningest coach in the league. Post-football activities In 1998, he returned to the University of Alabama, and earned a bachelor's degree in Social Work. In 2004, he was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame. During his time coaching in AF2, he owned and operated Humphrey Construction Company. As of 2012, Humphrey is vice president of business development for Bryant Bank in Birmingham, Alabama.Herndon: Former Alabama great Bobby Humphrey is watching a new No. 26 these days  al.com He was appointed to the City of Hoover's Parks and Recreation Board in 2014.

Shooting Incident In January of 1993, Bobby Humphrey was shot in his right thigh by friend and former teammate Mark Petties on an Alabama highway. Humphrey and Petties were returning from New Orleans, driving northbound on Interstate 65 in Humphrey's vehicle, when a fight ensued. The origin of the dispute was never made clear. A passing motorist saw the two fighting on the highway shoulder in Alabaster, AL, and called local police. When they arrived, Humphrey, 26,was laying on the ground. Eight days before the shooting incident, Humphrey was arrested for cocaine possession, aggravated assault and destruction of hotel property in Columbus, Ga. Humphrey was treated at Shelby Medical Center and released hours later after the bullet was removed.

Folger Shelfmark STC 13328 Title page of If You Know Not Me, You Know Nobody; the image is of a mid 19th-century type facsimile title page, not that of the edition of 1605. If You Know Not Me, You Know Nobody; or The Troubles of Queen Elizabeth is a two-part play by Thomas Heywood, depicting the life and reign of Elizabeth I of England, written very soon after the latter's death. The title deliberately echoes that of Samuel Rowley's 1605 play When You See Me You Know Me. Part 1 is a chronicle history of the main events in the reign of Mary I, ending with the accession of Elizabeth. It was entered into the Stationers' Register on 5 July 1605, and published in quarto soon after by the bookseller Nathaniel Butter. The play was popular, and subsequent quartos were issued in 1606, 1608, 1610, 1613, 1623, 1632, and 1639. The play was most likely written for and performed by Queen Anne's Men, and remained in their repertory many years. The full title of Part 2 was entered into the Stationers' Register on 14 September 1605 and was first printed in quarto in 1606, again by Nathaniel Butter. Subsequent quartos appeared in 1609 and 1632, plus an undated edition that is thought to have been issued in 1623. The 1632 quarto features an alternative text of Act V. Part 2 devotes its first three acts to the building of the Royal Exchange by Thomas Gresham and revolves around the character of Hobson, a haberdasher who desperately tries to curb his apprentices' reckless behaviour. He blames them for leaving his shop and going to taverns while he is away. Thomas Gresham decides to bind John Gresham, his nephew, as an apprentice to Hobson but this new apprentice reveals to be a prodigal who is only interested in taverns and disreputable wenches. John Gresham flees to France with 100 pounds he stole from his uncle, and proceeds to play tricks on his new master, sending him match instead of establishing a mercantile network in France. Hobson chases him there in his night gown and slippers and finds him in the house of a French courtesan. John tricks Hobson into believing that the courtesan is really a reputable business-woman, and then threatens to tattle on Hobson to his wife when the courtesan's identity is revealed. Hobson agrees not to punish John, but insists on bringing the troublesome factor back to England with him, thereby preventing any further tricks. During a pageant in honour of Queen Elizabeth, Hobson boldly introduces himself to the Queen and is sincerely surprised she does not remember him, hence the title of the play: \\"If you know not me, you know nobody\\". In fact Hobson has been gulled by a cony-catcher into believing the Queen asked him to give her some money, which he graciously provided. The Queen promises him he will be paid back. At this particular moment in the play, the action shifts from city comedy to history as the plot abruptly switches to the life of Queen Elizabeth. She escapes Doctor William Parry's assassination plot and faces the Spanish Armada's attempted invasion of England with other characters of political importance (notably Sir Francis Drake). Drake's victory rounds off the play. Chronological compression The Exchange was founded in 1565, and granted the name \\"Royal\\" in 1571; the Parry plot took place in 1584–85, and the Armada was repulsed in 1588. In the play, all these events follow quickly on one another, and the news of the battle of Alcazar (1578) is received before the Exchange becomes Royal. References *Chambers, E. K.

The exact composition of the ministry and the secretary's duties changed several times over the Early Modern period, but in general, the Département de la Maison du Roi oversaw four main areas: the \\"Maison du Roi\\" (\\"Household of the King\\"), the \\"Bâtiments du Roi\\" (\\"Buildings of the King\\"), the General Affairs of the Clergy, (from 1749 on) Affairs of the RPR (\\"Religion Prétendue Réformée\\", i.e. the Huguenots), and the administration of the capital city of Paris and the provinces. The post later reappeared as the Minister for the Maison du Roi.  History  Starting in the 16th century and then from the 17th century on, the \\"Maison du Roi\\" was overseen by a ministry, the \\"Département de la Maison du Roi\\", directed by a secretary of state, the \\"Secrétaire d'État à la Maison du Roi\\". Along with the \\"Department of War\\" (\\"département de la Guerre\\"), the \\"Département de la Maison du Roi\\" was the oldest of the specialized State Ministries, created in 1570 by Charles IX who reunited—under the control of Simon Fizes de Sauve -- the \\"ordinaire des guerres\\" and the Military Maison du Roi. Both departments were dissociated in 1594: Nicolas de Neufville, seigneur de Villeroy took over the Département of Foreign Affairs and the Department of War, while Martin Ruzé de Beaulieu took over the Maison du Roi. In 1661, the département was expanded to include Religious Affairs. In 1669, Jean-Baptiste Colbert bought the post from Henri de Guénégaud du Plessis-Belleville, and thus combined under his control the Maison du Roi with the Department of the Navy and the position of Contrôleur général des finances (chief financial officer of the realm). The Secretary of the Department of the Maison du Roi and Contrôleur général des finances would be linked only until 1699, but the Maison du roi and Religious Affairs would remain linked with Department of the Navy until 1749 (except for a brief separation from 1715–1718). After the downfall of Maurepas in 1749, the Department was broken apart: the Department of the Navy was made into its own Department and given to Rouillé while the Department of the Maison du Roi and of Religious Affairs was given over to comte de Saint- Florentin. The offices of the department were few: only four buildings in 1771, five in 1789. The department's archives are stored in two places: the \\"Grands Augustins\\" and the Palais du Louvre/Palace of the Louvre.  Oversight   The Maison du Roi  The \\"Maison du Roi\\" (Household of the King) was the name of the military, domestic and religious entourage around the Royal Family in the Kingdom of France. In essence, the Secretary's oversight was purely formal, as the officers of the \\"Maison du Roi\\" were under the direct authority of the Grand Maître of France (Chief Steward of France). Moreover, in practice, the military branch of the Maison du Roi was run by the Minister of War. The \\"Secrétaire d'État à la Maison du Roi\\" was however in charge of recruiting officers for the \\"Maison du Roi\\", and would receive prospective applications for posts and submit them to the king for his approval.  The King's Buildings  The Secrétaire d'État à la Maison du Roi oversaw the \\"Bâtiments du Roi\\" (Buildings of the King), run by (at various periods) a superintendent or directeur général of buildings. The service was responsible for the royal residences and for royal patronage of architecture, painting and sculpture. It also ran the Manufacture des Gobelins, the Manufacture de la Savonnerie and the Manufacture nationale de Sèvres. The Secretary also oversaw (either directly or through the service of the Bâtiments du Roi) cultural and scientific institutions such as the Bibliothèque du Roi, the Paris Observatory, the Jardin des Plantes, the Collège royal, French academies and royal entertainment. He was also in charge of buildings chosen for the États généraux/States-General or Estates-General (early medieval-\\"Old Regime\\" era national parliament), with three \\"estates\\" (houses) - \\"First Estate\\" (bishops/clergy), \\"Second Estate\\" (nobility), and \\"Third Estate\\" (commoners/tradesmen), later abolished after beginning of the French Revolution in 1789 when the \\"Third Estate\\" along with a few revolutionary progressive/republican members of the other two estates, walked out and declared themselves to be the new National Assembly of the First French Republic.  Religious Affairs  The Secrétaire d'État à la Maison du Roi was in charge of religious benefices. He oversaw the conduct of bishops, the elections of abbies and of the heads of French religious orders. He was in charge of relations between the government and the clergy. In 1749 the Secretary of State of the Maison du Roi was combined with the Secretary of State for Protestant Affairs in charge of the overseeing French Protestant affairs, although the two departments remained distinct.  Administration of Paris and the provinces  The Secrétaire d'État à la Maison du Roi was also in charge of the policing and general administration of French provinces (at first those with provincial estates or \\"pays d'état\\", and eventually over all other internal provinces), except for border regions (which were supervised by the Department of War). From 1589, and excepting the period 1749-1757, the position was also in charge of the city of Paris (lighting of streets, cleaning of streets, repression of beggars, oversight in moral affairs, foreigners, censorship of books, surveillance of newspapers and of public entertainment). In this role, he worked in collaboration with the lieutenant général de police and his administration.

The lake is the principal watershed for the Gananoque River, and boasts prime fishing locations. Charleston Lake Provincial Park is located on the shores of the lake, and offers camping, hiking, boating, fishing and interpretive sessions. Charleston Lake has over 100 miles of shoreline and over 100 islands with over 800 summer and permanent residences on the lake. The water surface is 26.2 km2, and the maximum depth is 91.1 m. A naturally occurring rock and tree formation shows a profile of the guardian of Charleston Lake known as Indian Head. Other than Charleston Lake Provincial Park, the County Park and Sand Bay are excellent destinations for day trips.

He was born in Mino Province (present-day Gifu Prefecture) and is famous for carving some 120,000 wooden statues of the Buddha and other Buddhist icons, many of which were given in payment for lodging on his pilgrimages to temples throughout Japan. Biography Childhood The most credible source has Enkū born in 1632 on the banks of the Kisogawa in central Japan in Mino Province (present-day Gifu Prefecture). His family was poor and, under the tightly controlled regime of the Tokugawa shōguns, there was little prospect of any kind of advancement. Social status, occupation, even religious affiliation, were rigidly prescribed. Travel was restricted. Tradition recounts that his mother was washed away and drowned in a river flood, probably when he was seven years old. Soon after this, Enkū left home and became a Buddhist monk. The temple Enkū entered belonged to the Tendai Jimonshu, one of the older branches of Buddhism in Japan. Tendai teaching accepts many ways to realise enlightenment, including the way of the artist – the way of making and distributing Buddha statues. The Jimonshu, or Jimon branch was particularly connected with the yamabushi – literally \\"those who sleep in the mountains.\\" Yamabushi practice In common with many yamabushi, Enkū was a healer and a practitioner of kampo, herbal medicine. In fact, we still possess some of his personal notes on medicinal plants. As he travelled in remote regions, his skills as a doctor would have been eagerly received among the poorer people. Carvings During his travels, he vowed to carve some 120,000 wooden statues. No two were alike. Many of the statues were crudely carved from tree stumps or scrap wood with a few strokes of a hatchet. Some were given to comfort those who had lost family members, others to guide the dying on their journeys to the next life. Thousands of these wooden statues remain today all over Japan, especially in Hida and Gifu regions. Enkū is probably now regarded as one of the most famous Japanese sculptors. What is less well known is that he was also a prolific poet. Poetry There are extant over 1,500 of Enku's Japanese poems in two collections along with a few more written on the back of statues. One collection of 100 poems is called, \\"Kesa Niji Hyaku Shu\\" (“One Hundred Poems Containing the Two Characters Kesa). The other which is much larger is called \\"Otoko Warashi Uta (“Male Child Songs”). Mostly he wrote waka (also known as “tanka”), an ancient five-line verse form with the syllables running usually, 5-7-5-7-7. Themes include his mountain practice, responses to nature and the seasons, romantic pieces and expressions of joy and bliss (he nicknamed himself Kanki Shamon Enku, \\"Bliss- monk Enku\\"). In 2015, a book called \\"In Heaven's River: Poems and Carvings of Mountain-Monk Enku\\" was published by Zenways Press in the UK with Japanese and English translations of 100 of Enkū's poems collected together by Enkū’s thirtieth-generation successor, Enju-sensei, together with photos of many of his carvings.

It first aired on Nicktoons, on August 11, 2006. To date there have been two The Boo Crew specials. On 2017, both specials have been uploaded on YouTube by Shawn Wayans in the channel entitled \\"The Boo Crew TV\\" with the opening theme omitted as the series was simply re-titled \\"The Boo Crew\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhezu5X-dzQhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzkaVeR9GpE Plot The show focuses on the adventures of a gang of neighborhood kids of different ethnic cultures known as \\"The Boo Crew\\" with D-Roc as the leader, often helping each other out and going to serious situations and learning a lesson in morals. The show features an abstract voice cast starring most of the Wayans family with the animation having some similarity to other black- centered shows such as The Proud Family. The show has a structure combination of African American cultural endurance and adoration with ending music videos similar to Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids and the children-centered oriented program synopsis on young love and romance commonly found in the classic Peanuts cartoon specials.  Characters  The Boo Crew *D-Roc: The leader of the Boo Crew who wishes to be a successful rapper. Without his hat or bandana, he has a huge bald head that bounces and is often made fun of for that (\\"HAHA! LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT WRECKING BALL\\"). He always plots the get rich quick schemes. A running gag is that when he raps, he sometimes forgets a word to rhyme with one of his dialogue and an angry offscreen listener throws a tomato or pie at his face shouting \\"It's (rhyming word), STUPID!\\" and driving off, as comedic humor. *Dee-Dee: D-Roc's loudmouth sister who wants to be the first female president. She has a crush on DJ. *Darren \\"DJ\\" Jobeley III: A Caucasian boy who acts gangster with his friends but acts like a British mannered boy to his sophisticated parents (Yo, whasup, B? How ya feelin'? What's going on, yo? Let's bounce, son). As his name implies, he is a mixmaster and carries his own turntable and boom box. He also claims to be mixed and believes that he is part-black often getting offended and aggravated of how the African American people are treated in the past. *Lissette: A Hispanic girl who wishes to be a singer. She has a crush on D-Roc. She carries her baby brother Luiz around in the stroller. She is a skilled master at jumprope. Slim likes her but she does not return the feelings. *Slim: An overweight boy, despite his name, loves eating and speaks in a slurred voice. He has a crush on Lissette. *Dirty: A filthy boy who speaks in a gibberish language often translated by the other gang and says \\"You heard me?\\" at the end of each sentence. He wears a sneaker necklace and the only thing that's clean is the sneakers that he wears. He is the master at beatboxing often doing it for the kids' raps. *Money: D-Roc's pet dog who can talk. He is seen wearing a baseball cap and red sneakers. When D-Roc gives him dog food, he ships it to Africa where they use it to build more houses similar to cement or mud. He also eats D-Roc's homework. His voice is modeled after rapper DMX. *Gwenny: An Eco-friendly valley girl who loves the environment by protesting against anything made by manufacturing that harms animals; even though she litters by throwing spray cans on the floor, though she does not notice and wears a fur coat, but uses the weather as an excuse. *Chad: A skate-punk and Gwenny's younger brother who loves skateboarding and is the misfit of the gang because he always has the most misfortunes such as getting a broken arm or falling in a trash can. He is almost never seen without his helmet and skateboard. *Soo Young: An Asian girl whose father owns many businesses and can create anything with her ideas. She sometimes helps D-Roc for his get rich quick schemes and acts harsh so people can work faster. * Baby Luiz: Lissette's baby brother who she carries in the stroller and is mostly seen with his blue pacifier and hanging on to his crotch. Despite his age, he starts first grade, wears a toupee, shaves and can already talk and rap; but in Spanish unlike his bilingual sister. Adults * Momma: D-Roc's cheapskate mother who loves talking on the incredibly long-corded telephone. * Principal Eyeverson: Also known as Principal Wanderingeye, he is the nearsighted principal at the Boo School who has a lazy eye and has trouble seeing or telling people apart but is very kind and generous. * Miss Attitude: A lady often speaking in the megaphone (with her lips visible) in charge of the summer program, a mall and as the public speaker announcer in the school often complaining about her job talking care of the Boo Crew for the summer. * DJ's Dad: DJ's sophisticated father speaking in British mannerism and has Bridge nights. * Jared: A dim-witted basketball player who never passed the third grade but is a talented athlete. He is a parody of Michael Jordan. * Lee Young: Soo Young's rich father who owns a taxi service, dry cleaning business, sushi restaurant and a grocery store called Foo's Fruits. Despite being tired, him with only one job would make him a lazy bum. He is nice enough to offer the children snacks of fish. * Joyce: A rival with Mama who lost to the Bargain fight sale. She may also fight with Mama in the upcoming Thanksgiving sale. * Mr. Johnson: Diane's father and the owner of the supermarket who sells Air Johnsons. Other characters * Diane Johnson: A multiracial (mixed) girl and classmate of D-Roc whom They are in a relationship.Her father is the greatest rapper in the world and he’s helping D-roc trying to rap so he can be like him . She is based on [(the black girl from brazs the movie.)] * O. Jenkins: An African man who is friends with Diane Johnson dad and they rap together D-Roc tried sell his money and d-roc and Diane Johnson broke up and got back together. * Big Kid: A humongous boy with a name tag \\"HELLO! MY NAME IS BIG KID!\\" on his overalls whose face is hidden and was accused by Dee Dee of cutting in line and threatened to rip D-Roc's face off. D-Roc was terrified of his size and corrects him by saying that she didn't say \\"cut in line\\", she said \\"we cut the price in half, read the sign\\" accompanied by creating a sign to prove its case, promoting him to get angrier by ripping D-Roc's face off because he can't see the sign due to his height. He does not like to be accused of anything nor does he like to be lied to, which influences him to fight. A running gag is that the situation involving him reminds him of a similar scenario with his mother such as his mom accusing him of being born ugly, and he discovered that his mom lied about the existence of the tooth fairy right when he knocked all his teeth out. Whenever he finishes hurting D-Roc, he runs home crying to his mom. On the Christmas special, he knocks D-Roc's skeleton out of his body before running. * Gavin: A poverted-kid whose parents are unemployed but wished for a G-bot to Mall Santa. The Boo Crew donated several of their gifts to him, including D-Roc's G-bot. * snoop dog : An older kid with huge chains on his neck and gold teeth who, alongside his friends The Boo Crew tend to be the biggest popular kids and everybody wants to be like them. He and The Boo Crew often play a game of knock on the door and run, figurative and literal means the people come outside and get off my porch.

His mother purchases a cheaper priced pair of Air Johnsons instead. Afraid of looking bad to his crew, D-Roc asks Soo-Young to make Air Jarretts out of Air Johnsons and when they work out well, they realize they can make money by converting the shoes.

The number of Serbs in Hungary has drastically diminished; in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries large Serb communities existed throughout Hungary, notably in Buda (western Budapest), Baja, Szentendre and Szeged. The Serb community in the territory of present-day Hungary has its origin in migrations from the territory of medieval Serbian states during and after the Ottoman conquest of these states. Matthias Corvinus and his successors are known to have welcomed Serbs from the other side of the Danube, giving the exiled military commanders fiefdoms to rule and defend from the Ottomans. After the dissolution of Austro-Hungarian Monarchy in 1918 and after new borders were defined by the Treaty of Trianon in 1920, only a small fraction of ethnic Serbs remained within the borders of post-Trianon Hungary. History The presence of Serbs in the territory of present-day Hungary date from the Middle Ages. The mother of the Hungarian king Géza II (1141-1162) was Helena of Serbia, a daughter of Uroš I, ruler of the Grand Principality of Serbia. During the rule of Géza II, her brother Beloš Vukanović was a palatine of the Kingdom of Hungary. When the Magyars arrived to the Pannonian Basin under Arpad in 896, they met there with the already well established Slavic population. This Slavic population however was quickly assimilated or otherwise exterminated. The Serbs who later migrated into the Pannonian Basin from the Balkans, were the descendants of those Slavs who in the 7th century migrated from the Pannonian Basin southwards into the Balkan peninsula. Since the 14th century, escaping from the Ottoman threat, a large number of Serbs migrated to the Kingdom of Hungary where many of them served as soldiers. After the Battle of Mohács in 1526, much of the territory of present-day Hungary came under Ottoman administration. During Ottoman administration towns in the territory of present-day Hungary began decaying and the former Hungarian and German population left them. In that time, especially in the 17th century, many Serb, and other Southern Slavic migrants settled in the territory of present-day Hungary. It is interesting that most of the Ottoman soldiers in the territory of present-day Hungary were South Slavs (mostly Serbs and Bosniaks). Frontiersman from Pomorišje, first half of the 18th century. After territory of present-day Hungary came under Habsburg administration, a new wave of Serb refugees migrated to the area in 1690, as a consequence of the Habsburg- Ottoman war. In the first half of the 18th century, Serbs and South Slavs were ethnic majority in several cities in the territory of present-day Hungary, including Buda, Szentendre, Baja, Pécs, Szeged, etc. After the devastating Ottoman wars these cities had a very low population. In 1698, more than a half of population of Pécs were South Slavs (including Serbs). In 1715, the population of Buda numbered 1,539 houses, of which 769 were South Slavic (mostly Serb), 701 German, and 68 Hungarian. In 1715, the population of Baja numbered 237 houses, of which 216 were South Slavic (Serb and Bunjevac), 16 Hungarian, and 5 German. In 1720, 88% of population of Szentendre were South Slavs (mostly Serbs). In 1720, the population of Szeged numbered 193 houses, of which 99 were Serb. Serbian Orthodox Museum and Church in Szentendre During the 18th and 19th century, the Hungarian-Serb ethnic border moved southward and fixed in the territory of present-day Vojvodina. Following the dissolution of Austro-Hungarian Monarchy in 1918, the Serbian army and South Slavic People's Administration from Novi Sad controlled not only present-day Vojvodina, but also southern parts of present-day Hungary. The Treaty of Trianon from 1920 defined the border between Hungary and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and assigned most of Baranya and the northern part of Bácska (around city of Baja) to Hungary. As a response to this, a short-lived Serb-Hungarian Baranya-Baja Republic was formed in this area in 1921. The president of the republic was Serb, Petar Dobrović. After the Serb-Croat- Slovene army evacuated the territory of the Baranya-Baja Republic the two countries signed a citizenship treaty. According to that treaty, members of the Serb minority in Hungary gained right to opt for citizenship of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. About two-thirds of the Serbs (called optants) left Hungary in the following decade. Almost the whole Serb population of Sárok, Deszk, Újszentiván, Szőreg, Majs and Dunaszekcső became optants. In 1910, 26,248 people in the territory of present-day Hungary spoke Serbian language. In 1920, number of Serbian speakers was 17,132, in 1930 7,031, in 1941 5,442, in 1970 11,177, in 1980 3,426, in 1990 2,953, 2001 3,388 and in 2011 3,708(compared with 7,210 declared Serbs in the same year). Geography Serbian Street (“Szerb utca”) in Budapest Small Serb communities are scattered in the southern part of the country. There are also some Serbs who live in the central part of the country - in bigger towns like Budapest, Szentendre, etc. The only settlement with an ethnic Serb majority in Hungary is Lórév (Serbian: Lovra / Ловра) on Csepel Island. This small village of 307 people had 180 Serb inhabitants (and 202 people with a Serb \\"cultural heritage\\"). But there are other small Serb settlements in the town of Ráckeve and the village of Szigetcsép, also on Csepel Island. Not far to the north the Bunjevci settlement of Tököl is to be found. A tradition of mutual weddings between Lórév and Tököl existed as well as strong connections with Serbs from the villages of Medina in the south, three villages north of Budapest -- Budakalasz, Pomáz and Csobánka. We also find Serbs and Bunjevci living together in other Hungarian towns, Baja, Gara and Katymár, and in the following villages, Csávoly, Felsőszentiván, Bácsalmás, Csikéria, Bácsbokod, Mátételke and Vaskút. Heritage Serbian Kovin Monastery built in 1487 Serbian Kindergarten, Primary School, High School and Students' Home Serbs left a valuable architectural heritage in Hungary. The number of Serbian Orthodox churches is higher than we should expect by the small number of present-day Serb population. These Baroque churches were mostly built in the 18-19th centuries when Serb merchants formed rich and influential communities in Hungarian towns. Village churches show the historical presence of Serbs in places from where they absolutely disappeared by now. Towns, cultural institutions, churches and monasteries: * The most complex example of Serb architectural heritage in Hungary is the old town of Szentendre (Serbian: Sentandreja), next to the Danube, with 7 Orthodox Churches (two of which have been sold), brightly coloured merchant houses and the Museum of Serbian Orthodox Heritage. * In Budapest, the Serbian Orthodox Cathedral in the Tabán district was damaged in WWII and later demolished.

The story of his conversion is one of the most celebrated in Sufi legend, as that of a prince renouncing his throne and choosing asceticism closely echoing the legend of Gautama Buddha.Muslim Saints and Mystics, Attar, trans. A.J. Arberry intro. on \\"Ebrahim ibn Adham\\"; Encyclopedia of Islam, \\"Ibrahim ibn Adham\\". Sufi tradition ascribes to Ibrahim countless acts of righteousness, and his humble lifestyle, which contrasted sharply with his early life as the king of Balkh (itself an earlier centre of Buddhism). As recounted by Abu Nu'aym, Ibrahim emphasised the importance of stillness and meditation for asceticism. Rumi extensively described the legend of Ibrahim in his Masnavi. The most famous of Ibrahim's students is Shaqiq al-Balkhi (d. 810). Life According to Indian- Sufi Muslim Traditions Ibrahim's family was from Kufa. He was born in Balkh (modern day Afghanistan). While some writers traced his lineage back to 'Abdullah, the brother of Ja'far al-Sadiq, son of Muhammad al-Baqir, and the grandson of Husayn ibn Ali, the most famous family tree of his Sufi ancestors along with most authors trace it to Umar bin Khattab. Accounts of Ibrahim's life are recorded by medieval authors such as Ibn Asakir and Bukhari. Ibrahim was born into the Arab community of Balkh as the king of the area in around 730 CE, but he abandoned the throne to become an ascetic. It is said that he was so wealthy King that he had 16 thousand wives and 1.8 million horses. He received a warning from God, through Khidr who appeared to him twice, and, abdicated his throne to take up the ascetic life in Syria. Having migrated in around 750 CE, he chose to live the rest of his life in a semi-nomadic lifestyle, often travelling as far south as Gaza. Ibrahim abhorred begging and worked tirelessly for his livelihood, often grinding corn or tending orchards. In addition, he is also said to have engaged in military operations on the border with Byzantium, and his untimely death is supposed to have occurred on one of his naval expeditions.Abu Nu'aym, vii, 388. His earliest spiritual master was a Christian monk named Simeon.Islam and the Perennial Philosophy, F. Schoun, ind. Ibrahim ibn Adham, Suhail Academy co. Ibrahim later recounted his dialogue with Simeon in his writings: > I visited him in his cell, and said to him, \\"Father Simeon, how long hast > thou been here?\\" \\"For seventy years\\", he answered. \\"What is thy food?\\" I > asked. \\"O Hanifite\\", he countered, \\"what hast caused thee to ask this?\\" \\"I > wanted to know\\", I replied. Then he said. \\"Every night one chickpea.\\" I > said, \\"What stirs thee in thy heart so that this pea suffices thee?\\" He > answered, \\"They come to me one day in every year and adorn my cell and > process about it, so doing me reverence; and whenever my spirit wearies of > worship, I remind it of that hour, and endure the labors of a year for the > sake of an hour. Do thou, O Hanifite, endure the labor of a year for the > glory of eternity.\\"Concise Encyclopedia of Islam, C. Glasse, Ibrahim ibn > Adham, pg. 178. According to the records of the Chishti Order of Sufis, he is among their early masters and was also taught for some time by Fudhail Bin Iyadh.Siyar ul Auliya i Chisht, 1884 reprint Delhi. As is often with the graves of saints, numerous locations have been placed as the burial place of Ibrahim ibn Adham. Ibn Asakir stated that Ebrahim was buried on a Byzantine island,Ibn Asakir, Tarikh kabir, Damascus, ii, 1330, 167–96. while other sources state his tomb is in Tyre, in Baghdad, in the \\"city of the prophet Lot\\",Encyclopedia of Islam, Vol. III, pg. 985. in the \\"cave of Jeremiah\\" in Jerusalem and, finally, in the city of Jablah (on the Syrian coast). Historicity and literary reception The medieval narratives of the life of Ibrahim are semi- historical. Ibrahim may have been a historical Sufi of the 8th century, whose legend was embellished in later accounts. The Persian Memorial of the Saints by Attar,Muslim Saints and Mystics, Attar, trans. Arberry, Ebrahim ibn Adham. for example, remains one of the richest sources on Ebrahim's conversion and early life as the king of Balkh. It was through the Persian memorials that literature on Ibrahim passed into the legendary literature of India and Indonesia, where further unhistorical embellishments were added. One of the main features of non-Arabic literature on Ibrahim is the feature of full- length biographies on the figure, as opposed to anecdotes centring on the main incidents in his life. Moreover, many of the non-Arabic accounts on Ebrahim's life preceded with a short account of the life of his father Adham. One of the most famous of these biographies was written in Persian by Rumi, which was adapted into Arabic form. Other such biographies were written in Urdu and Malay, which laid the basis for short biographies in Javanese and Sundanese.

Although nothing remains of the buildings but low walls and a cross-slab standing stone which sits in the middle of the compound, this site gives a very good idea of the layout of a small monastery of the Early Medieval period. Excavations by Tom Fanning in the 1970s revealed the ruins of an oratory, several clocháns (stone huts), some conjoined, a graveyard and about ten decorated stone slabs, of which one is a particularly fine example. This pillar measures 1.64 metres in height and is 0.6 metres wide by 0.26 metres thick and is decorated with an encircled Greek cross from which are pendant spiral designs terminating in a pelta. The stone was decorated in Early Christian times (c. 7th century). The letters 'DNE' - D(omi)ne - O Lord, are set sideways to the cross. A second stone is decorated with a large Latin cross coupled with bifurcated terminals and two crosslets in the upper angles. After the oratory was abandoned, the site was used as a ceallurach (children's burial ground) and further burials were made in box-like arrangements of stones, some covered with quartz and seashore pebbles. The monastic enclosure surrounding these features pre-dates the two groups of double clochans. One of the smaller cross-pillars has a stylised bird. Another has the inscription DNO on one side and DNI on the other. Some of the artefacts found in the excavation at Reask, including some of the cross-inscribed stones, are on display in Músaem Chorca Dhuibhne, which is in the nearby village of Baile an Fheirtéaraigh.

The full name (中华养生益智功) translates to \\"China Health Care and Wisdom Enhancement Practice.\\" The system distinguished itself from other forms of qigong by its strong emphasis on commercialisation, and a targeted strategy that aimed to build a national commercial organisation in China in the 1990s.Palmer (2007), p. 208 Zhong Gong achieved national prominence during the 'qigong fever' that gripped China during the Deng era. The denomination included a nationwide network of schools and healing centres based on Zhang's form of qigong before being outlawed by Chinese authorities in 1999. Zhang Hongbao claimed in 2003 to have about 38 million followers, and even Jiang Zemin allegedly believed in the curative power of Zhong Gong's message.Jensen, Lionel. Entry on \\"Falun Gong\\" in the Encyclopedia of Contemporary Chinese Culture, Edward L. Davis (ed.) Routledge 2004, pp. 252–263 After China declared Zhong Gong an illegal organisation, all its assets and those of the 3,000 entitles constituting the Unicorn Group were confiscated, its 600 principals arrested. Zhong Gong wilted away once the organisation was no longer able to transmit the material and social benefits which were motivational drivers for its followers. After a warrant for the arrest of leader Zhang Hongbao was issued, he fled to United States and applied for political asylum—he gained Protective resident status in U.S. on 13 June 2001. Zhang died in a car accident in July 2006.  History and development  In the aftermath of the 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations, Zhang Hongbao retreated to a remote base area in Sichuan, where he reorganised his followers as employees of a web of private enterprises owned by a parent firm, the Qilin Group.Thornton (2003), p. 143 During the early 1990s, Zhong Gong became the most popular of the various qigong schools, but rumours concerning Zhong Gong started to surface.Smith, Craig S. \\"Asylum Plea by Chinese Sect's Leader Perplexes the U.S.,\\" The New York Times, 31 July 2000 As controversy about Zhong Gong increased, Falun Gong gained in popularity, eventually superseding Zhong Gong as the largest movement of its kind. Its commercial activities were incorporated in China as the Unicorn Group (麒麟集团), a collectively ownership enterprise. In Mainland China, it had numerous operations, branches, and staff. There were six subordinate divisions, including Qigong training, healthy living, travel, education, medical. Political scientist Patricia M. Thornton at the University of Oxford lists Zhong Gong as an example of a cybersect, due to the group's reliance internet for text distribution, recruitment and information-sharing among adherents.Thornton, Patricia M. \\"The New Cybersects: Resistance and Repression in the Reform era\\" in Elizabeth Perry and Mark Selden, eds., Chinese Society: Change, Conflict and Resistance (second edition) (London and New York: Routledge, 2003), pp. 149–50.  Beliefs and teachings  Palmer, citing Ji Yi, said Zhang developed a style of Qigong which was based on automation, physics, relativity, bionics, and with distinctive use of mechanical engineering jargon,Palmer (2007) pp. 146–150 and founded Zhong Gong in 1987, launching it on the auspicious date of 8 August 1987. Zhong Gong is based on the \\"qilin culture\\" (麒麟文化), created by Zhang in 1987 which, as he claimed in 2000, is \\"an obvious challenge to Marxism and the CCP's one-party rule\\". According to Zhang's 'spirit-matter dialectics', both spirit and matter have objective existence and can transform into the other under certain circumstances. In 1992, based on the ancient theories of yin and yang, Zhang extrapolated his universal law of motion according to which all objects or matter can subdivide into 'Yin' or 'Yang', predicting anything or act which contravened it would bring eventual disaster. He asserted Marxist property right theory and the derived Communist Party aim to eliminate private property were in conflict with his laws. In 1993, Zhang advanced his theories of 'promotion-restriction-inhibition-transformation' derived from the Five elements. In 1998, Zhang put forward a moral code which he referred to as \\"eight virtues and eight calls\\". Qilin culture 'Qilin Culture' philosophy was developed by Zhang Hongbao, the master of Zhong Gong, and proclaimed during public lectures in Beijing.Palmer (2007), p. 81 According to a well- known account by Ji Yi, a journalist and enthusiastic qigong practitioner himself, \\"the qilin combines in a single body the essence of different species of living beings: the dragon's head, the pig's nose, the serpent's scales, the deer's body, the tiger's back, the bear's thighs, the ox's hooves and the lion's tail.\\" Qilin culture, according to Zhang, was made up of eight \\"systems\\": a philosophical system based on the traditional \\"diagram of ultimate return,\\" which is to explain the origin of all creatures, their functions, and final destinations; a system of life sciences based on the use of qi to penetrate the mystery of biological systems; a system of \\"special medicine,\\" which was different in important ways from Chinese and Western medicine, and \\"even garden variety qigong\\"; a system of art and aesthetics included qigong art, architecture, dance, music; a system of education; a system of industrial and political management; a system of everyday behaviour; a system of body practices.Ownby, David. Falun Gong and the Future of China (2008) Oxford University Press, pp. 73–74 Organisational techniques Zhang Hongbao's had two organisations which formed the foundation of what eventually became an \\"impressive set of interlocked enterprises, the engine of which was a Qigong practice\\" according to Patricia Thornton. More than any other qigong group, Zhong Gong concerned itself with a systematic training scheme of eight ascending levels. The practitioner would thus have a clear path of progression on which to advance. Unlike other qigong schools, which emphasised mastery of sitting meditation, movements, and inner alchemy, Zhong Gong geared its workshops around the acquisition of specific skills. The participants were to master a skill with satisfaction after several days training. Workshops aimed to train participants in Zhong Gong's brand of organisational and managerial techniques at the \\"second level.\\" They would then be able to go forth and set up their own Zhong Gong franchises. Stage one included basic techniques and posters; stage two covered organisational methods, certain qigong performance arts, and the 'secret of secrets' of Buddhist and Taoist techniques; stage three consisted of still meditation (jinggong), qigong hypnosis, and spontaneous boxing; stage four included more advanced qigong techniques like electric qigong, hard qigong etc., while stage five covered Fengshui, massage, regulation of the emotions, and more. The sixth, seventh, and eighth levels were never disclosed to the public.Palmer (2007), p. 209 Zhong Gong drew a large number of staunch believers across China, elaborating a highly organised structure that led Chinese Communist Party authorities to suspect it may turn into an opposing political force. Qilin Culture's modern management theory, based on the traditional yin—yang and five-elements cosmology, was the basis for the Zhong Gong organisation, according to Palmer.Palmer (2007), p. 83 It was claimed to be applicable to family, business or government, and aimed to synthesise the best aspects of the five phases of human social development: primitive society, slave society, feudal society, capitalist society and communist society. Banned in China The 12th session of the NPC Standing Committee passed a resolution on 30 October 1999 which allowed it to take action against \\"heretic cults\\" and which applied retroactively to Falun Gong, Zhong Gong and any other spiritual groups deemed \\"dangerous to the state\\".Leung, Beatrice. \\"China and Falun Gong: Party and society relations in the modern era,\\" Journal of Contemporary China, 11:33, 2002, pp. 761–784 However, Zhong Gong has been much more low key than Falun Gong, and the government crackdown on it is almost unknown in China.Cunningham, Philip. \\"Falling victim to U.S.-Chinese diplomacy,\\" The Japan Times, 30 December 2000 Palmer describes how Zhong Gong effectively ceased to exist once the organisation was no longer able to provide material and social benefits to its followers.Palmer (2007), p. 246 As a sign of Zhang's acumen, Thornton notes that when the Beijing daily reported that his Beijing-based International Qigong Service Enterprise had been shut down pending an investigation into possible criminal activities, Zhang hired the team of lawyers who had defended Mao's widow during the Gang of Four trial, and managed to gain a public apology from the paper. A five-year string of unsuccessful legal actions against the government followed, during which Zhang managed to elude arrest.Thornton (2008), p. 142 After China declared Zhong Gong an illegal organisation, all its assets and those of the 3,000 entities constituting the Unicorn Group were confiscated, and its 600 principals arrested. After a warrant for the arrest of leader Zhang Hongbao was issued, he fled to the United States and applied for political asylum. He was not granted asylum, but gained Protective Resident Status on 13 June 2001. Zhang died in the United States in a motor accident on 31 July 2006 at the age of 52. After Zhang's death, Zhong Gong almost disappeared from the public's eye.

Davies conceived it in 1963 whilst at Princeton University. However, the composer did not complete the opera until over 20 years later. The work received its premiere on 18 September 1987 at the Staatstheater Darmstadt, Germany. Besides the protagonist, represented by a dummy, there are 23 roles requiring seven singers (mezzo-soprano, countertenor, bass, two tenors, two baritones) and four dancers. The orchestra contains single winds including trumpet and horn, and strings, as well as a backstage brass band. Davies also incorporates a rock band in the instrumentation, in his use of various musical styles. John Warnaby has discussed the relation of the opera to the writings of James Joyce and Thomas Mann. Synopsis The opera is in a prologue and one act. The story concerns a mute child who never speaks or sings during the work and how his family deals with him and tries to mould him. In the Prologue, his parents and other authority figures hector him, as well as numerous television advertisements. By the end of the Prologue, the mute child's head has exploded. In the main act, several surgeons endeavour to reconstruct the child. In so doing, the child is urged to adopt conformist social and religious attitudes. One surgeon dissects the child's brain, and hopes to fix his moral and intellectual faults. Another surgeon works on the dummy's heart, and thus affects the emotional and religious centres. Another surgeon deals with the child's \\"sexual proclivities\\" via surgery on the genitals. Eventually, the Antichrist appears, with the dummy child \\"resurrected\\", who then turns on the surgeons as the phallus metamorphoses into a machine gun, which is directed at the audience as well as the surgeons.

Created by writer Len Wein and artist Gil Kane, the character first appeared in Marvel Team-Up #19 (March 1974). Fictional character biography Vincent Stegron was hired by S.H.I.E.L.D. to work with Dr. Curt Connors to study DNA of dinosaurs from the Savage Land. Inspired by the experiment that turned Connors into the Lizard, Stegron stole some dinosaur DNA and injected himself with it. In moments Stegron transformed into an orange semi-humanoid Stegosaurus-like creature. Stegron gained the ability to command real dinosaurs, and he planned to use them in his plans for conquest of the world and converting all of humanity into creatures like himself. Taking several dinosaurs with him from the Savage Land to New York City, he encountered Spider-Man, Black Panther, and Ka-Zar. During the battle that followed, Stegron was beaten by being knocked into a nearby river and seemingly drowning.Marvel Team-Up #19–20. Marvel Comics. Months later, Stegron returned and blackmailed Connors into helping him restore several dinosaur remains from a museum. Connors did what Stegron asked and accidentally turned into the Lizard. The two reptile-men clashed as Spider-Man arrived and later Stegron was sent into hibernation by the extremely cold temperatures the weather was producing.Amazing Spider-Man #165–166. Marvel Comics. Months later Stegron, now back in his human form, woke from hibernation and wandered New York. During a battle between the Vulture and Spider-Man, Stegron regained his dinosaur form and powers and joined many of Spider-Man's enemies (including Doctor Octopus, Vulture, Rhino, Beetle, Boomerang, Answer, Swarm, Strikeback, and Hardshell) in an all-out battle to defeat him. Stegron was knocked unconscious and was taken in by the authorities.Lethal Foes of Spider-Man #1–4. Marvel Comics. Stegron battling Spider-Man Stegron eventually returned to the Savage Land, where he took over a S.H.I.E.L.D. installation which drew the attention of Thunderstrike, Black Widow, and Black Panther. During the battle over the installation, Stegron was forced into an extremely cold environment and again went into hibernation.Thunderstrike #20. Marvel Comics. Sometime later, Stegron managed to awaken from his slumber and terrorized Roxxon Oil (who was illegally drilling in the Savage Land). Soon, Stegron was opposed by Ka-Zar, Shanna the She-Devil, and Spider-Man. During the battle, the Hulk and a gigantic bird/ox-like creature known as Chtylok arrived and helped Stegron fight Roxxon Oil. The heroes joined forces with Stegron when they realized he was trying to protect the Savage Land. Eventually, Stegron managed to scare the Roxxon agents and was left in peace in the Savage Land.Sensational Spider-Man #13–15. Marvel Comics. Sometime later, Stegron (reverted to his human form) exiled himself to wander the Arctic Circle when he stumbled upon the Rock of Life. Inspired by its de-evolving abilities, he took it with him back to New York where he slowly began to transform back into his dinosaur form. He then sent the Rock to a friend of his, who then put it on display at the Museum of Natural History in hopes that it would devolve the inhabitants of New York City into prehistoric creatures like himself with him as their leader. As a result, various heroes and villains with connections to the animal kingdom such as Spider-Man, Puma, Black Cat, Vulture, Lizard, Man- Wolf, and Vermin were affected by its power, causing an increase in their savagery. Spider-Man maintained control, and he discovered Stegron's plans at the museum where the two battled. With the help of Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman, Spider-Man managed to stop the Rock's powers from reaching others in New York using a piece of his armor. He then beat Stegron into submission. Stegron was then taken into custody by the authorities as the Fantastic Four placed the Rock in a secure vault in the Baxter Building.Sensational Spider-Man (vol. 2) #23–27. Marvel Comics. Stegron again returned to the Savage Land, but shortly after his return, Roxxon Oil attacked again, intent on obtaining vibranium. Stegron was recruited by Ka-Zar and Brainchild to help fight the attackers.Marvel Comics Presents (vol. 2) #6–7. Marvel Comics. Stegron was later seen in the Negative Zone's Prison during the 2008 \\"Secret Invasion\\" storyline.Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four #3 (2008). Marvel Comics. Somehow, he escaped and returned to the Savage Land. While there he happened upon the starving Devil Dinosaur, who had slumped into a depression after his companion Moon-Boy was kidnapped by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. Fearing for the survival of the beast (as it was the last of its species), Stegron left the Savage Land without informing Ka-Zar to wage war on S.H.I.E.L.D. Building an army of reanimated dinosaurs, Stegron marched across the US, attacking military base after base, searching for the missing primate. He met little opposition. His only serious challenge coming from attacks by the Fifty State Initiative. Eventually, due to the help of their new recruit Reptil, Stegron was defeated and taken into custody. Learning the motive behind his attack, they agreed to return Moon Boy to the Savage Land to be reunited with his companion.Avengers the Initiative: Featuring Reptil. Marvel Comics. Stegron later collaborates with Sauron in a plan to turn humanity into dinosaurs where they fought Spider-Man and the mutant students from the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. The duo's plans are unraveled by their own infighting, purposely exacerbated by their mutual crush Shark Girl who caused their powers to neutralize each other. Stegron is later revealed as the mastermind behind a monster attack on a church. After Eddie Brock discovers one of Stegron's dinosaurs and delivers it to Liz Allan, CEO of Alchemax, he heads down the sewers and finds his lair, until he is spotted and captured.Venom #151.

A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as the state's 76th lieutenant governor from 1947 to 1955. Life and career Timmerman was born in Anderson County, the son of Mary Vandiver (Sullivan) and George Bell Timmerman Sr., a U.S. federal judge.http://www.scencyclopedia.org/sce/entries/timmerman-george-bell-jr/ He was raised in Charleston and graduated from The Citadel. After receiving a law degree from the University of South Carolina, he practiced law with his father in Batesburg. Timmerman enlisted in the U.S. Navy as an officer with the entry of the United States in World War II after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina Returning to South Carolina after the war, Timmerman ran as a Democrat for Lieutenant Governor in 1946 on the same ticket as fellow veteran Strom Thurmond. He was elected for a term beginning in 1947 and reelected in 1950 for another four-year term. Gubernatorial tenure While Governor he opposed the Supreme Court's ruling in 1954 declaring segregated public schools unconstitutional. Timmerman fought the changes brought by the decision to defend \\"the integrity of the races\\" and \\"our customs and institutions.\\" He urged Congress to limit the authority of the United States Supreme Court. He regarded Northern insistence on racial integration as hypocritical. In the gubernatorial election of 1954, he faced nominal opposition in the Democratic primary and ran unopposed in the general election becoming the 105th Governor of South Carolina in 1955. He sought to thwart an order by the Interstate Commerce Commission for desegregation of long-distance travel in 1955, especially because it affected public waiting rooms. At the same time he opposed Federal court orders integrating public parks, bathing beaches and golf courses. For the desegregation of public schools, he vowed with other Southern Governors to thwart it with Congressional or state legislation. In 1956 he was the favorite presidential candidate of the South Carolina delegation at the Democratic National Convention. During the convention he was a leader of Southern opposition to what he called \\"radical civil rights legislation and radical planks in the platform.\\" He signed a law in 1956 to bar members of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People from public employment in South Carolina. He opposed civil rights laws enacted by the Eisenhower Administration. Judicial appointment and retirement After leaving the governorship in 1959, Timmerman was appointed as a judge to the state's Eleventh Judicial Circuit in 1967 and served until 1984. While a judge, Timmerman declared the 1974 South Carolina law on capital punishment to be unconstitutional. This ruling was affirmed in the 1976 U.S. Supreme Court decision Gregg v. Georgia. He died on November 29, 1994 in Batesburg- Leesville, South Carolina.

He was the eldest son of Ron (Vince Earl) and \\"DD\\" Dixon (Irene Mariot), and the brother of Tony (Gerald Bostock, later Mark Lennock) and Jacqui (Alexandra Fletcher). Mike was involved in two major storylines in 1993, the most significant of which was his relationship with stepmother Bev McLoughlin (Sarah White) that resulted in the birth of their son Josh, who was originally believed to have been his brother. This resulted in the break-up of his father and stepmother's relationship. 1993 was also the year that Mike's younger brother Tony was left in a coma after a car crash which claimed the life of neighbour Frank Rogers (Peter Christian) in November. Tony died three months later having never regained full consciousness, and at the funeral Jimmy Corkhill (Dean Sullivan) confessed that he was the driver of the other car which had caused Frank's car to crash. Mike later married Rachel Jordache (Tiffany Chapman) and their daughter Beth was born in early 2000. But another tragedy struck in December that year when Mike was badly injured in a car crash involving a stolen car being driven by Tim O'Leary (Philip Olivier). Clint Moffat (Greg Pateras) suffered a broken arm in the collision, while Robbie Moffat (Neil Davies) and Tim fled the scene uninjured. Mike had suffered a major spinal injury and used a wheelchair for six months after the crash, and even after leaving his wheelchair he spent several more months on crutches. Mike's father Ron received a nine-month prison sentence for firearms offences in December 2001 (although he was cleared of alternative more serious charges of manslaughter and murder), and by the time Mike left the Close in 2003 he was rarely featured in significant storylines. Mike later landed a job at Brookside Comprehensive as a teacher. After splitting up with Rachel, he witnessed the birth of his son, Michael Jr. When Ron and Bev became engaged, Josh asked Ron if he would adopt him. Ron was flattered by the offer and agreed. Ron and Bev then got a solicitor to finalise the arrangements.

It is an adaptation of Bryan Burrough's non-fiction book Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933–34. Set during the Great Depression, the film chronicles the final years of the notorious bank robber John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) as he is pursued by FBI agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale), Dillinger's relationship with Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard), as well as Purvis' pursuit of Dillinger's associates and fellow criminals Homer Van Meter (Stephen Dorff) and Baby Face Nelson (Stephen Graham). Burrough originally intended to make a television miniseries about the Depression-era crime wave in the United States, but decided to write a book on the subject instead. Mann developed the project, and some scenes were filmed on location where certain events depicted in the film occurred, though the film is not entirely historically accurate. Released on July 1, 2009, the film received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $214 million worldwide. Plot In 1933, John Dillinger infiltrates Indiana State Penitentiary and assists in the jailbreak of his crew. During the firefight, his mentor Walter is shot and killed by the prison guards. Dillinger and company head for a nearby farm, where they change clothes and eat before driving to a safe house on the east-side of Chicago. After killing Charles Floyd, FBI agent Melvin Purvis is promoted by J. Edgar Hoover to lead the hunt for Dillinger. Purvis shares Hoover's belief in using modern methods to battle crime, ranging from cataloging fingerprints to tapping telephone lines. In between a series of bank robberies, Dillinger meets Billie Frechette at a restaurant and impresses her by buying her a fur coat. Frechette falls for Dillinger even after he reveals his identity, and the two become inseparable. Purvis leads a failed ambush at a hotel where he believes Dillinger is staying, and an FBI agent is killed by Baby Face Nelson, who escapes with Tommy Caroll. Consequently, Purvis requests for Hoover to allow additional, experienced agents to deal with the hardened killers. In response, Intelligence officer Charles Winstead, of military background, arrives to assist Purvis. Police arrest Dillinger and his gang in Tucson, Arizona, after a fire breaks out at the Hotel Congress where they are staying. Dillinger is extradited to Indiana, where Sheriff Lillian Holley has him locked up in the Lake County Jail in Crown Point. Dillinger and other inmates use a fake gun to escape; he is unable to see Frechette, who is under tight police surveillance. Dillinger learns that Frank Nitti's associates are unwilling to help because his crimes are motivating the FBI to prosecute interstate crime, which imperils Nitti's bookmaking racket. This severs Dillinger's connections with the Chicago outfit, prompting him and Red Hamilton to look elsewhere for money. Carroll goads a desperate Dillinger into robbing $800,000 from a bank in Sioux Falls with Baby Face Nelson. During their escape, both Dillinger and Carroll are shot, and the group is forced to leave Carroll behind. They retreat to the Little Bohemia Lodge in Manitowish Waters, Wisconsin and realize their haul (~$46,000) is significantly less than Nelson said it would be. Dillinger hopes he can free the rest of his gang from prison, including Pierpont and Makley, but Hamilton convinces him this is unlikely. Dillinger longs to see Frechette again. Purvis and his men apprehend Carroll and torture him to learn the gang's location. Purvis organizes an ambush at Little Bohemia. Dillinger and Hamilton escape separately from the rest of the gang. Agents Winstead and Hurt pursue Dillinger and Hamilton through the woods, engaging in a gunfight in which Hamilton is fatally wounded. Trying to escape, Nelson, Shouse, and Van Meter hijack a Bureau car, killing Purvis's partner Carter Baum in the process. After a car chase, Purvis and his men kill Nelson and the rest of the gang. Elsewhere, Hamilton dies from his injuries after warning Dillinger he must let Frechette go. Dillinger meets Frechette, telling her he plans to commit one more robbery that will pay enough for them to escape together. When Dillinger drops her off at a tavern that he thinks is safe, she is arrested and badly beaten during interrogation for refusing to reveal Dillinger's whereabouts. Purvis eventually intervenes to stop Frechettes's violent interrogation. Dillinger agrees to participate in a train robbery with Alvin Karpis and the Barker Gang, intending to flee the country the next day. He receives a note from Frechette through her lawyer, Louis Piquett, instructing him not to break her out of jail as she will be released in two years. Purvis enlists the help of madam and Dillinger acquaintance Anna Sage, threatening her with deportation if she does not cooperate. She agrees to set up Dillinger, whom she believes will come to hide out with her. Dillinger and Sage see Manhattan Melodrama at the Biograph Theater. After the film, Purvis signals other agents upon seeing them leave. Dillinger spots the police unit but is shot before he can aim his gun. Winstead kneels beside Dillinger's body and listens to his last words. Purvis goes to inform Hoover of Dillinger's death as bystanders begin to crowd around Dillinger's body. Winstead meets with Frechette in prison; she has already been informed of Dillinger's death. Winstead tells her that he thinks Dillinger's dying words were, \\"Tell Billie for me, 'Bye bye Blackbird.'\\" Frechette sheds tears as Winstead leaves. Cast Production Development Paris premiere Public Enemies is based on Bryan Burrough's 2004 non-fiction book, Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933–34. Burrough had originally begun researching the subject with the aim of creating a miniseries. The idea was accepted by HBO and Burrough was made an executive producer, along with Robert De Niro's Tribeca Productions, and was asked to write the screenplay. However, Burrough had no experience in screenwriting, and says his drafts were probably \\"very, very bad. Ishtar bad.\\" He began simultaneously writing a non-fiction book, which he found easier, spending two years working on it while the interest in the miniseries disappeared. Burrough's book was set to be published in the summer of 2004 and he asked HBO to return the movie rights. They agreed and after the book was released, the rights were re-sold to production companies representing Michael Mann and Leonardo DiCaprio, the latter of whom was interested in playing John Dillinger. Burrough met with a representative and then heard nothing for three years. The actor eventually left the project to appear in Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island. Mann had written a screenplay about Alvin Karpis in the 1980s which was never produced. After reading an excerpt from Burrough's book in Vanity Fair, he eventually worked to develop a film based on the book with producer Kevin Misher. Novelist and screenwriter Ronan Bennett had written a screenplay about Che Guevara which Mann had intended to develop, but the project was shelved as Steven Soderbergh was already working on his two-part biopic about Guevara. Starting in 2006, Bennett worked for over 18 months on adapting Burrough's book, writing several drafts. Former NYPD Blue writer and Southland creator Ann Biderman rewrote the screenplay with Mann, who polished it before shooting began. Of the screenplay, Burrough has said \\"it's not 100 percent historically accurate. But it's by far the closest thing to fact Hollywood has attempted, and for that I am both excited and quietly relieved.\\" Filming Principal photography began in Columbus, Wisconsin on March 17, 2008 and continued in the Illinois cities of Chicago, Aurora, Joliet and Lockport; and the Wisconsin cities of Oshkosh, Beaver Dam, Darlington, Milwaukee, Madison and several other places in Wisconsin; including the Little Bohemia Lodge in Manitowish Waters, Wisconsin, the actual location of a 1934 gun fight between Dillinger and the FBI. Some parts of the film were shot in Crown Point, Indiana, the town where Dillinger was imprisoned and subsequently escaped from jail. The actual 1932 Studebaker used by Dillinger during a robbery in Greencastle, Indiana was also used during filming in Columbus, borrowed from the nearby Historic Auto Attractions museum. The decision to shoot parts of the film in Wisconsin came about because of the number of high quality historic buildings. Mann, who had been a student at University of Wisconsin–Madison, scouted locations in Baraboo and Columbus as well as looking at 1930s-era cars from collectors in the Madison area. In addition, the film was shot on actual historical sites, including the Little Bohemia Lodge, and the old Lake County jail in Crown Point, Indiana, where Dillinger staged his most famous escape where legend has it he fooled jail officers with a wooden gun and escaped in the sheriff's car. Scenes were shot at places that he frequented in Oshkosh. The courthouse in Darlington is the location for the courthouse scenes. A bank robbery scene was shot inside the Milwaukee County Historical Society, a former bank in Milwaukee that still has much of the original period architecture. In late March 2008 portions of the film were shot at Libertyville High School. Footage includes one of the school's science labs, an office, the school's front entrance, and the locker rooms. In April 2008 the production filmed in Oshkosh. Filming occurred downtown and at Pioneer Airport, including scenes shot using a historic Ford Trimotor airliner owned by the Experimental Aircraft Association. Later that month, filming started at the Little Bohemia Lodge. In April and May 2008, film crews shot on the grounds of Ishnala, a historic restaurant in the Wisconsin Dells area. The film became a flash point in the public debate about the \\"film tax credits\\" that are offered by many states. The state of Wisconsin gave NBC Universal $4.6 million in tax credits, while the film company spent just $5 million in Wisconsin during filming.According to a study by Wisconsin's Department of Commerce. Michael Mann, the director, decided to shoot the movie in HD format instead of using the traditional 35mm film. Public Enemies would be Mann's first all-digital feature.

Post- production Elliot Goldenthal composed the score of Public Enemies. Before Goldenthal wrote any music, he and Mann \\"sifted through tons and tons of American blues\\" as the director had talked about Billie Holiday's music \\"from the very beginning.\\" Goldenthal said, \\"My job was chiefly composing dramatic music that didn't necessarily have to sound like it came from 1931 or 1933. It could be timeless.\\" Goldenthal previously worked with Mann on Heat (1995). He commented that Mann \\"doesn't like too many twists and turns in the music's structure. He really responds to things that evolve very, very slowly. He wants music that the images, the edits, the dialogue can float above without it corresponding too much.\\" Release A preview of Public Enemies was seen at the end of the 81st Academy Awards, with the first trailer being released shortly after on March 5, 2009. Public Enemies had its world premiere in Chicago on June 19, 2009, and was screened at the Los Angeles Film Festival on June 23, 2009. The film was given wide release in the United States on July 1.  Home media  Public Enemies was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in the United States December 8, 2009. The two-disc special edition features a commentary track by the director and featurettes about the making of the film and the historical figures depicted in the film. In promotion of the home media release, the multiplayer browser game Mafia Wars featured collectible \\"loot\\" from characters in the film. Reception Box office Public Enemies opened at number three behind Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs with $25.3 million. The following weekend it had a 45.5% drop to $13.8 million for a running total of $66.2 million. The next three weekends the film would go on to have decent drops of 46% or less. It went on to gross $97.1 million domestically with a worldwide gross of $214.1 million in revenue, against its production budget of $100 million. Critical response Depp at the film's Paris premiere. Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 68% based on 277 reviews, with an average rating of 6.38/10. The site's critics consensus states: \\"Michael Mann's latest is a competent and technically impressive gangster flick with charismatic lead performances, but some may find the film lacks truly compelling drama.\\" At Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 70 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale. Rob James from Total Film gave the film 4/5 stars, stating: \\"This superstar crime thriller emerges as something surprising, fascinating and technically dazzling.\\" Most critics reviewing the film praised individual performances, specifically Depp as Dillinger. Roger Ebert, who gave it a 3.5/4 stars, stated: \\"This Johnny Depp performance is something else. For once an actor playing a gangster does not seem to base his performance on movies he has seen. He starts cold. He plays Dillinger as a fact.\\" Billy Crudup's performance was also praised, with his performance being described as \\"disarmingly good\\" by Varietys Todd McCarthy. Critics also gave praise to the film's cinematography and set pieces. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times stated: \\"Michael Mann's 'Public Enemies' is a grave and beautiful work of art. Shot in high-definition digital by a filmmaker who's helping change the way movies look, it revisits with meticulous detail and convulsions of violence a short, frantic period in the life and bank-robbing times of John Dillinger.\\" While most critics praised the film, others expressed displeasure. Critic Liam Lacey, of The Globe and Mail, believed the film was missing \\"any image of the economic misery that made Dillinger a folk hero\\", and, \\"the most regrettable crime here is the way that Mann, trying to do too much, robs himself of a great opportunity.\\" Similarly, Richard Corliss of Time claimed the film's emphasis on docudrama allowed for \\"precious little dramatic juice\\". Public Enemes has been described as a neo-noir film by some authors. Keith Uhlich of Time Out New York named Public Enemies the seventh-best film of 2009. Historical accuracy Shortly before the theatrical release of Public Enemies, Burrough wrote that director Michael Mann \\"impressed [him] as a real stickler for historical accuracy. Yes, there is fictionalization in this movie, including some to the timeline, but that's Hollywood; if it was 100% accurate, you would call it a documentary.\\" Dillinger's jailbreak from Crown Point, Indiana, the gunfight at the Little Bohemia Lodge, and Dillinger's death near the Biograph Theater in Chicago were all filmed where they actually happened. Burrough's non-fiction book on which the film is based details the demise of multiple infamous criminals in a 14-month period in 1933–34, including Dillinger, Bonnie and Clyde, the Barker-Karpis gang, the Kansas City Massacre, and Machine Gun Kelly. In focusing on Dillinger, Mann and co-writers Biderman and Bennett omitted Bonnie and Clyde entirely, briefly included only one member of the Barker gang (Alvin Karpis), and left out Pretty Boy Floyd except for his death. In the film, Dillinger is shown participating in a 1933 prison break from Indiana State Prison and frees some of his associates in a shootout. In reality, Dillinger did help smuggle weapons into the prison for his associates, however it is unclear how: Burrough's book reports that some believed Dillinger tossed the weapons over the prison fence, while other accounts (and the film) suggest that the guns were smuggled in boxes of silk sent to the prison shirt factory. Also, Dillinger was not present during the escape, because he was imprisoned in Lima, Ohio at the time, and \\"few shots were fired\\" according to historian Elliott Gorn (the only injury was a clerk shot in the leg, and no guards were killed). Dillinger's preexisting friendship with those he helped break out, like Pierpont and Makley, who had taught Dillinger how to rob banks while he was in prison with them previously, is not presented. Mann explained that \\"[Dillinger and his associates] employed techniques picked up from the military by a man [...] [who] mentored Walter Dietrich, the man who died at the beginning of the movie, who mentored Dillinger. So Dillinger's time in prison was really a post-graduate course in robbing banks, but what really interested me was he doesn't so much get out of prison when he's released but he explodes out\\". Contrary to the film, “Pretty Boy” Floyd (full name Charles Arthur Floyd) was not shot in an apple orchard as suggested. After the death of John Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd subsequently became public enemy No. 1. Floyd was shot and killed three months later. The location of his death was in East Liverpool, Ohio in a cornfield. While Melvin Purvis was present at the time of Floyd’s death he was one of several agents present at the time, Floyd died of two gunshot wounds. Floyds last words are believed to have been \\"I'm done for; you've hit me twice.\\" During a phone call with Hoover, Purvis requests assistance from experienced cops in the film, a decision that Hoover actually made on his own. In reference to Dillinger's escape from Crown Point, Mann said \\"[Dillinger] didn't take six or seven people hostage, he took 17 officers hostage with that wooden gun he had carved. It wouldn't be credible if you put it in a movie, so we had to tone it down.\\" In the course of Dillinger's 1933–34 crime spree, he is depicted as killing multiple people; Gorn writes that Dillinger himself \\"probably murdered just one man\\": William Patrick O'Malley, a cop who had been shot during a holdup in East Chicago, Indiana. Although Purvis was in charge of the Bureau of Investigation's office in Chicago as depicted in the film, fellow agent Samuel Cowley led the Dillinger investigation in its final months before Dillinger's death. Homer Van Meter and Baby Face Nelson are shot to death by Purvis after a vehicular pursuit from the Little Bohemia Lodge in the film. Van Meter was actually killed by St. Paul police a few weeks after Dillinger's death, and Nelson was killed on November 27, 1934 in a gunfight with Cowley. In the film, Dillinger and Purvis have a brief conversation in person while Dillinger is incarcerated. In reality, they came close to seeing each other (right before Dillinger died), but never actually exchanged words. In the film, Dillinger walks into the detective bureau of a Chicago police station unrecognized and asks an officer for the score of a baseball game being broadcast on the radio, something he actually did according to Mann and Depp. However, the game being broadcast is anachronistic for the time period. Additionally, Winstead hears Dillinger's last words – \\"Bye, bye, blackbird\\" – and later relays them to Frechette in the film. Burrough wrote that Dillinger's lips were reportedly moving just after he fell from being shot outside the Biograph Theater and that \\"Winstead was the first to reach him\\", but what he might have said is unknown (not to mention that his speech may have been slurred due to his injuries).

It was mainly, but not exclusively, an Edinburgh University student organisation. The formal purpose of the Society is as a place for social interchange and for practising of professional competency in rhetoric, argument, and the presentation of papers among fellow members. While continuing to meet in its rooms in the University's Old College, it has no formal links to the University. History The founding group, in November 1764, consisted of John Bonar, the younger, John Bruce, William Creech, Henry Mackenzie, and a Mr Belches of Invermay. They were encouraged by William Robertson. A split occurred in the Society in 1794, when Francis Jeffrey and Walter Scott urged the inclusion of contemporary politics in the scope of permitted debating topics. At this period, of political repression, the Society was a venue appreciated by young Whigs. They included Henry Brougham and Francis Horner. Halls in Old College The Society continues to meet in the rooms set aside for it when Edinburgh University's Old College was built. The A-listed rooms were designed by Robert Adam and fitted out by William Henry Playfair. Influence The Edinburgh Review (second series) was founded in 1802 by a group of essayists who knew each other first in the milieu of the Speculative Society. The University of Cambridge had a Speculative Society in the early years of the 19th century; it was one of the clubs that merged to form the Cambridge Union Society. Around 1825 Utilitarians and Owenites in London engaged in debates, and a formal Debating Society consciously modelled on the Speculative Society of Edinburgh was set up by John Stuart Mill. It was ambitious, but proved short-lived.

After a police lieutenant is killed, the New York Police Department enlists gentleman criminal Simon Templar to fight criminal elements in the city. Released by RKO Pictures, The Saint in New York marks the first screen appearance of Templar, also known as \\"The Saint\\". Louis Hayward stars as the title character, with Kay Sutton as his love interest. Alfred Hitchcock was initially discussed as a possible director for the film. This was the first of eight films in RKO's film series about The Saint. After being replaced in the series by George Sanders, Hayward would not play The Saint again until 1953 in Hammer Films production of The Saint's Return. There had not been a Saint film made in twelve years. Plot Police Lieutenant Martin, an officer leading the fight against New York gangsters, is killed. Jake Irbell is arrested and charged with his murder, but has to be released when prosecution witnesses are either coerced into changing their testimony or simply disappear. A civilian crime commission demands action of the police commissioner, but he has no fresh ideas. William Valcross (Frederick Burton), a respected leading citizen and member of the commission, suggests they resort to drastic measures and recruit Simon Templar (Louis Hayward), the \\"Saint\\", a British amateur Detective with a reputation for dealing with criminals outside the law. The commissioner reluctantly agrees to give the Saint free rein to do what he must. Valcross spends months tracking the Saint down, following a trail of dead (criminal) bodies across Europe and South America. Templar is intrigued by the challenge and is given a list of six gangsters whose removal would hopefully bring peace to the city. Disguised as a nun, the Saint kills Irbell just as he is about to shoot his most determined enemy, Inspector Henry Fernack (Jonathan Hale). (This differs from the original novel in which the Saint shoots an accused cop-killer in cold blood after the man walks free from court). As he works his way through the list, Templar learns that the mysterious \\"Big Fellow\\" is the mastermind who hides his identity by communicating with his underlings solely through Fay Edwards (Kay Sutton). Templar meets Fay, and they are attracted to each other. She saves his life twice when his recklessness gets him in trouble. The Saint disposes of the last of the six original targets, Hutch Rellin (Sig Ruman), leaving only their leader. Fay has given her word not to divulge the Big Fellow's name, but agrees to point him out when she meets him the next morning at the bank where the profits of three years worth of crime have been kept. When Valcross happens by, Templar tells him why he is waiting there. Valcross starts to leave, but when Fay shows up, she recognizes him. He fatally shoots her before Templar guns down the Big Fellow. Valcross wanted Templar to kill his men so he would not have to share the loot.

Orson Welles\\",The Saint in New York at Turner Classic Movies considered \\"rakish\\" while staying faithful to Charteris' vision.\\"The Saint in New York\\" Time Out\\"The Saint in New York\\" The New York Times However he was unable to repeat the role because he was signed to a multi-picture deal by Edward Small who wanted to make Hayward a star.Staff (November 1, 1938) \\"Louis Hayward to Play Lead in 'Man in the Iron Mask' for United Artists; Opening at Continental: 'The Singing Blacksmith,' New Yiddish Picture, Will Begin Engagement Today; Casting for 'Hotel Imperial'; Coast Scripts Of Local Origin\\" The New York Times p.27 After being replaced in the series by George Sanders (Sanders later being replaced by Hugh Sinclair), Hayward would return to the role 15 years later in 1953's The Saint's Return (known as The Saint's Girl Friday in the US). In the RKO films, Templar's New York Police Department contact, Inspector Fernack, as played by Jonathan Hale, appeared four times, even in films not specifically set in New York; Templar's British law enforcement foil, Inspector Teal of Scotland Yard, would appear in films set in Britain, played by different actors. In 1937, Alfred Hitchcock met with Lillie Messinger of RKO. Hitchcock showed interest in coming to America and making The Saint in New York. Ultimately, the film was made a year later with Ben Holmes directing. Reception The film was extremely popular, making a profit of $195,000.

John Goodsall is currently touring with Brand X and performing with acclaimed singer/songwriter/guitarist James Bracken. Goodsall was born in Pennsylvania and has lived in Los Angeles, England, Milan and Minnesota.  Career  He began playing guitar at age 7. At 15, he became a professional musician and joined Carol Grimes' Babylon, with members of Joe Cocker's Grease Band, Juicy Lucy and Jon Hiseman's Colosseum. He then toured extensively, first with The Alan Bown Set, then with Atomic Rooster. For his stint with Atomic Rooster, he adopted the pseudonym \\"Johnny Mandala.\\" After Brand X's 1979 world tour (the last with Phil Collins), Goodsall moved to Los Angeles and worked as a session musician and as a member of the band Zoo Drive (1980–1987) which included Doug Lunn, Paul Delph and Atomic Rooster drummer Ric Parnell (aka Mick Shrimpton of Spinal Tap). Goodsall also performed and/or recorded with Bill Bruford, Desmond Dekker & The Aces, Peter Gabriel, Bryan Adams, Toni Basil to name a few. In 1992, he also toured with bandmate Percy Jones and Ronnie Ciago, accompanying Swiss ex-Yes keyboardist Patrick Moraz. The Fire Merchants released two albums, Fire Merchants and Landlords of Atlantis before Goodsall and Percy Jones re-formed Brand X as a trio in 1992 with drummer Frank Katz. Katz was in Jones' band Tunnels with whom Goodsall also recorded on their album Progressivity. This Brand X line-up released X-Communication and Manifest Destiny, which also featured Tunnels' midi-vibes player Marc Wagnon and some keyboards & composition by Franz Pusch.

Pusch produced The Fire Merchants self-titled 1st album with Goodsall,Doug Lunn (bass) and Chester Thompson (drums).This trio was featured on Tamiya Lynn's album 'Silk' and other projects. Most of the keyboard/synthesiser sounds however in the Brand X & Fire Merchants trios were triggered by John's midi-guitar. In 1997 Brand X embarked on a 3-month tour of Europe & Japan as a quartet with John Goodsall, Percy Jones, keyboardist Kris Sjobring from Goodsall's L.A. based group Trancendental Medication, & drummer Pierre Moerlen from Gong.

Located approximately 10 miles south of Sierra Vista, Arizona, it is the highest mountain in the Huachuca mountain range and a popular local hiking destination. The Miller Peak Wilderness encompasses 20,190 acres and is managed by the Coronado National Forest.https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/coronado/recarea/?recid=25498 This is also the most southerly peak and land area to rise above 9,000 feet in the continental United States. The area was affected by the 2011 Monument fire and most of the pine trees seen in older photographs were burned and destroyed. Scrub oak are beginning to replace the areas that were previously covered by pine. Google “Satellite” images from 2018 would seem to show that many of the pre-fire pine and fir trees are still there and very much alive. Furthermore, the satellite images also tend to suggest that in the few locations where 100% tree kill took place, the forest is already beginning to regenerate. Google Satellite Hiking up Miller Peak The summit of Miller Peak can be gained by any of several trails, which all involve moderately strenuous hikes requiring approximately in elevation gain and distance round-trip. Perhaps the most well-known trailhead is found at the end of Miller Canyon Road, near Hereford, Arizona. Other popular trails include the Montezuma Pass trailhead in the Coronado National Forest and the Carr Peak trailhead, but the short trail to the summit off the main Crest Trail can be reached from nearly any other trail in the Huachucas. Notable landmarks along the way include Bathtub Springs and Bear Saddle. Nearby Carr Peak () can be reached in the same day, along the Crest Trail. Those attempting to hike to the summit of Miller Peak should bring at bare minimum 3 liters of water, especially in the summer months. The humidity in winter is very low (<15%) so bring more water than you expect even when the temperatures are not high. In winter snow storms are common. In summer fierce lightning storms and flash floods hit the peaks so do not hike in summer when thunderstorms are present. Always be aware of your surroundings. You will also occasionally cross paths with Border Patrol agents as they also hike the area on patrol.
