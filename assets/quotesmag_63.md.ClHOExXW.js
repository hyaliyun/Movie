It belongs to the parish of Hubberston in the historical hundred of Roose. It is located directly to the west of the larger town of Milford Haven, and is a district of the community of Milford Haven It had a population of 2,313 inhabitants in 2001KS01 Usual Resident Population: Census 2001 'Key Statistics for Urban Areas', Office For National Statistics and is mainly residential. Etymology The name Hakin is derived from the Old English Hecke, meaning \\"corner in the bend of the stream\\", and the German Ecken, meaning \\"a point of land\\".Hakin CP Junior School Hakin: A Pictorial History: Book 1, C.I.T Print Services, Haverfordwest, 1998. ASIN B0018LIPK2 The word was used as a geographical term to describe the location of an area, as late as 1794. The term Haking to describe the current boundary was first recorded in 1861, in the British Postal Guide, provided as a sub-office under Milford. Prior to this, the area had been referred to as Hubberston, or Hubberston-Haking. History Hakin, 1868 The Observatory Hakin has been a settlement since at least the 13th century. It has variously be known as Haking, and later as Old Milford, to distinguish it from the newer settlement across the tidal estuary.A Topographical Dictionary of Wales Lewis, Samuel (1849) pp. 430-440 A ferry service to Ireland operated from Hakin towards the end of the 18th century, although this ceased in the early 19th century.Wing Commander Ken McKay A Vision Of Greatness: The History of Milford 1790-1990, Brace Harvatt Associates, 1989. Between 1801 and 1803, the town and waterway were protected by temporary batteries at Hakin Point, in response to the perceived threat following the Fishguard Invasion.Phillips, Benjamin A Pembrokeshire's Forts & Military Airfields 1535 - 2010, Logaston Press, 2013 At a site on high ground in Hakin, Charles Francis Greville planned to build The College of King George the Third to study mathematics and navigation, whose centrepiece would be an observatory. Although the observatory was built, and scientific instruments delivered, the college never functioned as such as after the death of Greville in 1809 the whole project was abandoned. The remains of the observatory still stand and are grade II* listed. By 1849, the district of Hakin was described as a considerable centre of boat building, with approximately 200 \\"shipwrights residing at that place\\". However until the construction of a bridge linking the populations of Hakin and Milford, access to the district was via a plank across Hubberston Pill, and Hakin was considered something of a poor relation to the main town. Point Street, formerly Store Street, was the busy hub of the community, characterized by numerous public houses, stores to service the maritime trade, and prostitution. The completion of the Milford Docks in 1888 radically altered the Hakin landscape. Whereas Hubberston grew up around St David's church and Hubberston Green, Hakin evolved around Hakin Point and Point Street. With the construction of council housing in the interwar period, the division between the two districts became less clear. An initial building phase included prefabs in Nelson Avenue, Harbour Way and Observatory Avenue, although these were later replaced with more substantial properties. Transport Hakin is separated from Milford Haven by Hubberston Pill, a once tidal estuary. Access is via Victoria Bridge, which is reached via the A4076 through Milford Haven. A town circular bus service operates, providing access to Milford Haven.Bus Routes - South West Pembrokeshire Pembrokeshire County Council Website The town is served by Milford Haven railway station. Hakin Dock railway station operated briefly from a location on the docks.Parker, Richard, The Railways of Pembrokeshire, Noodle Books, 2008. Education There are several primary schools in the town: Gelliswick school The MITEC School of Boatbuilding & Marine Engineering, a branch of Pembrokeshire College, offers courses in boatbuilding and marine engineering. It is located in Milford Docks. Governance The Milford Hakin electoral ward elects a councillor to Pembrokeshire County Council. Prior to 1996 the ward for elections to Dyfed County Council was simply called Hakin.

Larson is notable for winning $110,237 () in cash and prizes, at the time the largest one-day total ever won on a game show. He was able to win by memorizing the patterns used on the Press Your Luck game board. Originally from southwestern Ohio, Larson used his cash winnings for taxes and real estate investments. As a result, Larson lost all of his winnings within two years of the show's taping and moved to Florida, where he later died of throat cancer at the age of 49. Since his death in 1999, Larson's game has re-aired on TV at various times and inspired two Game Show Network documentaries: Big Bucks: The Press Your Luck Scandal in 2003 and Cover Story: The Press Your Luck Scandal in 2018. Preparations Michael Larson began recording episodes of Press Your Luck shortly after its premiere on CBS in September 1983 with his VCR. While watching, he noticed that the randomizer that moved the light indicator around the 18-square \\"Big Board\\" had only five patterns. Larson began memorizing these patterns, increasingly confident he could predict when and where the randomizer would land. As he locked in the patterns, Larson began playing along with the \\"Big Board\\" rounds to test his hypothesis, pausing his VHS tape at various intervals. Moreover, Larson discovered that the fourth and eighth squares (from #1 in the top left corner then clockwise around the board) always contained cash and never a \\"Whammy\\", a bandit-like cartoon character that, when landed on, would result in the resetting of the player's score to zero, accompanied by an on-screen animation that showed the Whammy taking the player's earnings. Larson also learned that square #4 always contained the top dollar values and that, in the second round, contestants were awarded an additional spin if landing on those spots ($3,000, $4,000, or $5,000 in square #4, and $500, $750, or $1,000 in square #8). This proved crucial to Larson's theory, as he could retain control of the board in the second round as long as he wished if he kept following the patterns. In May 1984, Larson used most of his savings to fly to Los Angeles to audition for Press Your Luck. Contestant supervisor Bobby Edwards was suspicious of Larson's motives when he interviewed Larson on May 19, and was unwilling to allow him on the show, but executive producer Bill Carruthers viewed Larson's claim to be a \\"small-town plebeian desperately in need of a chance to win some money\\", as a good sob story for the show, and overruled Edwards. Carruthers would later regret this move. Thus, Larson was added as a contestant on the fourth episode of the taping session, intended to air Friday, June 8, 1984. While waiting in the green room, Larson met Ed Long, a Baptist minister from California booked for the third episode of the session. They struck up a conversation. Long recalled that Larson asked how many times he had seen the show. When Long replied he had seen it only once, Larson responded by looking at him as though he \\"were from another planet.\\" Larson told Long, \\"I really hope we don't have to play each other,\\" before leaving the green room, but they would in fact face off as Long won his match and a total of $11,516 in cash and prizes. The two men competed against Janie Litras, a dental assistant, in the next episode of the session. The game Introduction Larson showed up to his taping wearing a cheap suit, that he purchased at a local thrift store. Host Peter Tomarken, introduced the three players, starting with a recap of Long's winnings from the previous episode, and a joke about a question Long missed in the earlier episode. Tomarken then introduced Larson and asked him what he did for a living. Larson mentioned driving an ice cream truck in the summer, and how he was hoping to win enough money to be able to retire from it, and Tomarken asked if he had the truck with him, joking that they had orders for ice cream. Tomarken then asked if Larson would still eat the ice cream if he retired from the truck, and Larson claimed he'd OD'd on it. Tomarken jokingly (but ironically) hoped Larson wouldn't OD on money. Tomarken then introduced Litras, who talked about the eccentric Polish dentist she worked for. First round As customary, the game began with the first of two rounds in which contestants answered questions to earn spins for the \\"Big Board\\"; a correct buzz-in answer earned three spins, while a correct multiple-choice answer earned one spin. Larson's memorization of the patterns could not help him here, and he struggled early. On the second question, the host asked, \\"You've probably got President Franklin D. Roosevelt in your pocket or purse right now, because his likeness is on the head side...\\" Larson buzzed in at this point and answered, \\"$50 bill\\" (which has a portrait of President Ulysses S. Grant), after which Tomarken finished the question \\"...of what American coin?\\" with the answer being \\"a dime\\", the other choice being \\"a nickel\\". He did not buzz in again, answering the last two questions multiple choice and finishing with three spins, behind Long's four and Litras's ten. With the fewest spins, Larson went first. On his first spin, he hit a Whammy; however, on his next two, he hit square #4 twice for $1,250 and finished the round with $2,500. Long and Litras finished the round without a Whammy and won $4,080 and $4,608, respectively, putting Larson in last place. Second round Larson buzzed in correctly for two of the four questions, and earned a total of seven spins in the second question round, ahead of Litra's three and Long's two. Since he was in third place, he got to play first at the \\"Big Board\\" and went to his pattern play, aiming for squares #4 and #8. Larson quickly bumped his total to over $10,000. Early on, his pattern play was irregular, as he stopped four times on squares that did not follow his pattern: a trip to Kauai worth $1,636 in square #7, $700 and one spin in square #17, \\"Pick a Corner\\" in square #6 (where he was given the choice of $2,250 in square #1, $2,000 in square #10, or $1,500 and one spin in square #15; he chose $2,250), and a sailboat worth $1,015 in square #7. After the sailboat, Larson's pattern play became more accurate, as he hit his target squares each time he spun. Tomarken was increasingly astounded that Larson was still spinning despite not having seen a Whammy for so long. Larson continued to press on, passing more and more milestone markers without losing any of his four remaining spins. The episode was taped into two parts since Larson kept pressing. As he passed the $40,000, $50,000, and $60,000 marks, Tomarken virtually begged Larson to stop more than once, fearing he would hit a Whammy. Larson finally decided to stop once he reached $102,851. He had by this time made 40 spins on the board without hitting a Whammy, in which 37 were for cash. Of those 37 cash spins he hit square #4 twenty times, including six in a row. He also managed to land on square #8 fifteen times, hitting it consecutively three in a row twice. After he announced he was passing his remaining four spins, Larson raised his arms in triumph and received a standing ovation from the audience. By rule, Larson's spins went to Litras as she had the next highest money total. However, since she was the leader after the first round, she had to wait to play until Long, who earned two spins in the second round of questions, completed his turn. On the first of his two spins, a bewildered Long hit a Whammy and lost the money he earned in the first round, leading Tomarken to wonder aloud if Larson \\"knew that the Whammy was coming.\\" Long hit $5,000 and a spin on his next spin and did it again on the spin after that, but hit a second Whammy with his final spin. Litras then took her turn, starting with the first of the four spins Larson had passed that she was required to take by rule. On that spin, she hit a Whammy and lost her first round total. However, since she had Whammied, the remaining passed spins were moved into the earned column and added to the three spins Litras earned in the second question round, giving her a total of six spins. Litras picked up $9,385 in cash and prizes in five total spins, but because she managed to hit spaces with extra spins, she used only three. Litras then passed those spins to Larson, who was visibly upset and said, \\"I didn't want 'em,\\" as he received the three spins. Nonetheless, Larson picked up where he had left off, following his patterns, and hit his marks with his first two spins. He hit square #17 on his last spin, which was a space that had a Whammy in it, but he stopped the board before the Whammy could shuffle into the square and won a trip to The Bahamas valued at $2,636, causing Tomarken to joke, \\"With that money, you could buy The Bahamas, Michael!\\" This brought Larson's total to $110,237, and he had two earned spins to work with. Larson passed them to Litras, who failed to earn any additional spins with them, and despite winning extra money on them, couldn't come anywhere near Larson's grand total, thus ending the game. Larson's final total included $104,950 in cash. At the end of the episode, Tomarken asked Larson why he decided not to pass his remaining spins before he did, considering the lead he rapidly gained over Litras and Long. Side- stepping revealing how he had won the game, Larson responded with, \\"Two things: one, it felt right, and second, I still had seven spins and if I passed them, somebody could've done what I did.\\" Episode length Each episode of Press Your Luck was thirty minutes in length, and prior to Larson's appearance, the series had never needed to straddle games or stop during play as a match would always be completed within the allotted time frame. However, Larson's streak of hitting his marks every time stretched the length of the episode well past the usual thirty minutes and the producers were unsure how to proceed. While the entire episode was recorded in one shot, the production staff decided that it would need to be split up for airing. Once Larson passed $36,000, the producers cut to a freeze frame of the contestant area and Tomarken (in a chroma key shot) then tossed to a commercial. Once back from the commercial, Tomarken informed the viewers that because of the extraordinary circumstances, the match could not be completed on the June 8 episode and would instead be finished on the next scheduled airing on Monday, June 11. He then signed off with the words \\"To be continued...\\" superimposed on the screen. When Press Your Luck returned after the weekend break, the episode started with the same freeze frame image. Tomarken (again chroma keyed over the image) then brought the viewers up to speed on what Friday's episode entailed, first by introducing Larson's opponents and then introducing Larson and explaining what he had done so far, before the game resumed. Freeze frames were also used to lead into and out of the first two commercial breaks when Larson eclipsed the $50,000 and $100,000 marks, with voiceovers by Tomarken leading into and out of them. Accusations of cheating While Larson was running up the score, the show's producers contacted Michael Brockman, then head of CBS's daytime programming department. In a 1994 TV Guide interview commemorating the Larson sweep, conducted at the time the movie Quiz Show was released, he recalled, \\"Something was very wrong. Here was this guy from nowhere, and he was hitting the bonus box every time. It was bedlam, I can tell you, and we couldn't stop this guy. He kept going around the board and hitting that box.\\" The program's producers and Brockman met to review the videotape. They noticed that Larson would immediately celebrate after many of his spins instead of waiting the fraction of a second it would take for a contestant to see and respond to the space they had stopped on, effectively showing he knew he was going to get something good. It was also noticed that Larson had an unusual reaction to his early prize of a Kauai trip, which was out of his pattern ‚Äì he initially looked puzzled and upset, but then recovered and celebrated after a pause. At first, CBS refused to pay Larson, considering him a cheater. However, Brockman and the producers could not find a clause in the game's rules with which to disqualify him (largely because the board had been constructed with these patterns from the beginning of the series), and the network complied. Because he had surpassed the CBS winnings cap (at the time) of $25,000, Larson was not allowed to return for the next show. The five original light patterns on the \\"Big Board\\" were replaced with five new ones for about a month, and those were replaced with a different set of five new patterns for another month. A further reprogramming of the board with 32 patterns was completed in August 1984, effectively ensuring that no one could duplicate Larson's trick; all subsequent versions employ this method. The show ended its run in September 1986. Episode broadcasts After the broadcast of Larson's two episodes, CBS suppressed the episodes for nineteen years, as both the network and Press Your Luck producer/creator Bill Carruthers at that time considered the incident to be one of their biggest embarrassments. When USA Network (and later, Game Show Network) bought the rights to rerun Press Your Luck, CBS and Carruthers insisted that the Larson episodes must not be aired. On March 16, 2003, GSN was allowed to air the episodes as part of a two-hour documentary called Big Bucks: The Press Your Luck Scandal, hosted and narrated by Tomarken. The documentary was produced by and aired on GSN (in association with Lionsgate and RTL Group, the latter of which now owns the Press Your Luck franchise), and broke all previous viewership records for the network. The Big Bucks documentary included additional footage, directly from the original master tapes, that had been edited out of the episodes for their initial broadcast. The original telecast was dedicated to the memory of Carruthers, who had died two weeks before the airing. As part of the commemoration, Larson's opponents from 1984 were invited back to be contestants on Whammy! The All-New Press Your Luck, playing against Larson's brother, James, with Tomarken returning to host the question round. Despite the fact that the board was now fully random (host Todd Newton called it \\"Larson-proof\\"), and there was no way the same trick could have been performed, Long and Litras (who had remarried and taken the surname Litras-Dakan) still lost. When James hit the \\"Big Bank\\" space on his first spin of the first round, Long proceeded to joke with Newton that he had \\"seen this before\\". At one point, Litras-Dakan advanced to first place before hitting a Double Whammy shortly afterward, effectively giving James the win. Long, who was in last place, was the last to spin, and racked up some winnings, but not enough to catch up to James, who had won a digital grand piano worth $6,695, while Newton closed the game by announcing, \\"The legacy continues.\\" On January 14, 2018, GSN aired a second documentary on the Larson story entitled Cover Story: The Press Your Luck Scandal. The debut airing earned 583,000 viewers. The Larson episodes themselves aired after the Cover Story documentary. Both of Larson's episodes were edited together into one video and uploaded onto the Buzzr YouTube channel on July 17, 2019. Later life, death, and legacy After Press Your Luck, Larson became an assistant manager at local Walmart stores in Dayton, Lebanon, Xenia and Bellbrook, Ohio. He also ran a promotions and marketing company, Group Dynamics Downline, out of his Lebanon home. In November 1984, Larson learned about a local radio show promotion promising a $30,000 prize for matching a $1 bill's serial number with a random number read out on the air. Over several days, he withdrew his remaining winnings in $1 bills, examined each dollar, and (upon discovering that he did not have the winning number) re-deposited roughly half of the money. Larson left about $50,000 in his house, which was stolen in a burglary while he was attending a Christmas party. Larson told TV Guide in 1994 that after the burglary he called on the producers of Press Your Luck to stage a \\"tournament of champions\\" for a chance to score big again. The producers declined. In 1994, the release of the film Quiz Show renewed discussion about game show scandals, and Larson was interviewed on Good Morning America. By this time, he had been diagnosed with throat cancer, and his voice was noticeably weakened. Michael Larson ultimately never saw the return of his winnings and failed at several get rich quick schemes, his all-consuming hobby. Ultimately, his cancer overtook him. He died on February 16, 1999. A biographical feature film was planned in 2000 in which Bill Murray would portray Larson, but was never produced. Larson's performance on Press Your Luck was featured in a July 2010 broadcast of This American Life. Larson's daytime network game show winnings record stood until 2006, when Vickyann Chrobak-Sadowski won $147,517 in cash and prizes on the Season 35 premiere of The Price Is Right. However, it was not enough to surpass Larson's inflation-adjusted record ($110,237 was ).  Adaptations  In 2017, Spanish author Javi de Castro published a graphic novel about the scandal, titled Larson: el hombre con m√°s suerte del mundo (Larson: The Luckiest Man in the World).

It can reach a body length of 25 cm (10 in) and is irregularly surfaced with spines and a knobby appearance. The fish has venomous spines to ward off enemies. The fish are nocturnal, and often dig themselves partially into the sandy seabed during the day. The body is red or sandy yellow and well camouflaged on sandy and coral seabeds. Physical description Inimicus didactylus I. didactylus adults can attain a body length of up to 26 centimeters in length. The body color is red or sandy yellow with light blotches, and very similar to that of the surrounding sandy or coral seabed in which they are found. This coloration acts as a camouflage which renders them extremely difficult to detect in their natural habitat. The skin is without scales except along the lateral line, and is covered with venomous spines and wartlike glands which give it a knobby appearance. The head is flattened, depressed and concave. The eyes, mouth and nostrils project upwards and outwards from the dorsal aspect of the head. Sexual dimorphism is not believed to occur in this species. Fin morphology: * dorsal fin: composed of 15 to 17 spines and 7 to 9 soft rays. * caudal fin: composed of 2-4 spines and 4-14 soft rays, with dark bands at basal and subterminal positions. * pelvic fin: composed of one spine and 3-5 soft rays. * pectoral fin: composed of 10-12 rays. The two most caudal rays of each pectoral fin are detached from the rest of the fin, and angled in a ventral direction. The fish employ these two rays to prop up the forward part of their body, as well as to \\"walk\\" along the bottom of the substrate.World Database of Marine Species: Spiny devil fish .

The ventral surface of the pectoral fins bears broad black bands containing smaller, lighter spots at the basal and distal ends. In I. filamentosus, these bands are attenuated, while the bands of I. sinensis have yellow spots on them. This is a key feature for distinguishing the two species, which are otherwise nearly identical. Behavior I. didactylus is a piscivorous ambush predator. It is nocturnal and typically lies partially buried on the sea floor or on a coral head during the day, covering itself with sand and other debris to further camouflage itself. It has no known natural predators. When disturbed by a scuba diver or a potential predator, it fans out its brilliantly colored pectoral and caudal fins as a warning. Once dug in, it is very reluctant to leave its hiding place. When it does move, it displays an unusual mechanism of subcarangiform locomotion ‚Äî it crawls slowly along the seabed, employing the four lower rays (two on each side) of its pectoral fins as legs. Its dorsal spines are venomous. See also * Ambush predator * Demersal fish References External links * Myers, P., R. Espinosa, C. S. Parr, T. Jones, G. S. Hammond, and T. A. Dewey. 2008.

The route begins in Bobcaygeon at a junction with former Highway 36, and proceeds north along the boundary between Kawartha Lakes and Peterborough County to a junction with Highway 121 just south of Kinmount. The route was designated as Highway 500 in 1956. A major renumbering resulted in it becoming Highway 649 in 1964. The route remained generally unchanged until it was decommissioned and transferred to Victoria County at the beginning of 1998; it then became County Road 49\\\\. In 2001, Victoria County was restructured as the City of Kawartha Lakes, but the road retained the same number.  Route description  The road runs in a predominantly north-south direction and covers a distance of . The road crosses primarily rural geography between its southern terminus, City Road 36 (Main Street), and northern terminus, City Road 121, with the exception of the village of Bobcaygeon at its southern terminus. The road crosses the boundary between the Ordovician limestone to the south and the granite Canadian Shield to the north, resulting in a hilly landscape with many large rock outcroppings.  History  The road that is now Kawartha Lakes Road 49 started in 1853, when an act of parliament set forth the building of colonization roads into what was then the frontier of Upper Canada. One of the first of these roads was named the Bobcaygeon Road, after the village at its southern end. In 1956, the southern portion of the Bobcaygeon Road through Minden was transferred to the responsibility of the provincial government and numbered as Highway 500. Highway 121 was also opened along the Bobcaygeon Road that year, from south of Kinmount to Minden. On March 1, 1964, a major renumbering took place in the Kawartha ‚Äì Haliburton ‚Äì Peterborough area, which resulted in Highway 500 being renumbered as Highway 649\\\\. The road held this designation until January 1, 1998, when the entirety of Highway 649 was decommissioned and transferred to Victoria County, which designated it as Victoria County 49. In 2001, Victoria County was restructured as the city of Kawartha Lakes, and the road was renamed Kawartha Lakes Road 49, which it remains known as today.

Named after the co-founder of Montreal, Jeanne Mance, the park is located along Park Avenue, opposite Mount Royal, and just south of Mount Royal Avenue. History The park was previously known as Fletcher's Field. According to local tradition, the park was named after one Fletcher, who lived on the outskirts of the grounds and pastured his cows there. The history of the park began at the end of the 19th century with the planning of Mount Royal Park and the city's acquisition of land on Mount Royal, which ran from the summit of the mountain to Esplanade Avenue, between Pine Avenue and Mount Royal Avenue. In 1878, Montreal's Crystal Palace was relocated to Fletcher's Field. The structure was destroyed by fire in July 1896. In 1879, Fletcher's Field was identified by the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain as a notable source of Hyoscyamus niger, a psychoactive plant. The park used as a military parade ground, as was Logan's Farm (now part of La Fontaine Park). During the Great War, troops were trained on Fletcher's Field. The Montreal Lacrosse Club and Royal Montreal Golf Club (as well as youth lacrosse and football clubs) also used Fletcher's Field. In September 1910, during the Montreal Eucharistic Congress, there was a campaign to rename the park in recognition of the founder of the H√¥tel-Dieu de Montr√©al. The city of Montreal officially changed the name of the park to Jeanne Mance Park in 1990. The plaza entrance of Jeanne Mance Park opposite the Sir George-√âtienne Cartier Monument is affectionately known as Place Fletcher's Field, serving as a reminder of the park's former name. Features * The park features playgrounds, one softball field, tennis courts with night lights, a soccer/football field with artificial turf, a children's swimming pool (in the summer) and an outdoor skating rink (in the winter). * An Art Deco drinking fountain with an inscription in honour of Louis Rubenstein is located at the corner of Mount Royal Avenue and Park Avenue. * Public washrooms beneath Place Fletcher's Field, the plaza opposite the Sir George-√âtienne Cartier Monument on Park Avenue.

American Progress, an allegory of Manifest Destiny, was widely disseminated in chromolithographic prints. It is now held by the Autry Museum of the American West in Los Angeles, California.Museum website entry  Description  American Progress has become a seminal example of American Western art. The painting serves as an allegory for Manifest Destiny and American westward expansion. The painting was commissioned in 1872 by George Crofutt, a publisher of American Western travel guides, and has been frequently reproduced. The woman in the center is called \\"Progress\\", and on her head is what Crofutt calls \\"The Star of the Empire\\". Progress moves from the light-skied east to the dark and treacherous West, leading white settlers who follow her either on foot or by stagecoach, horseback, Conestoga wagon, wagon train, or riding steam trains. Progress lays a telegraph wire with one hand and carries a school book in the other. As she moves westward, indigenous people and a herd of buffalo are seen fleeing her and the settlers. American Progress visually portrays the process of American westward expansion. The figure of Progress is ushering an era of modernization, development, and advancement to the West, which in the painting is portrayed as a dark and savage place, especially when compared to the eastern side of the painting. But, with the ushering in of these developments, the indigenous people living in the West and their way of life is cast out.

Political career Talbot was returned to Parliament for Castle Rising in 1777, a seat he held until 1782, when he succeeded his uncle, William Talbot, 1st Earl Talbot, as third Baron Talbot and entered the House of Lords. In 1784 the earldom of Talbot which had become extinct on his uncle's death was revived when Talbot was created Viscount of Ingestre, in the County of Stafford, and Earl Talbot, of Hensol in the County of Glamorgan.

Family Lord Talbot married Lady Charlotte, daughter of Wills Hill, 1st Marquess of Downshire, in 1776. A portrait of Talbot was painted by Pompeo Batoni while there are portraits of his wife by both Sir Joshua Reynolds (1783; now in Tate Britain) and by Thomas Gainsborough and John Hoppner (1788; now in the Dunedin Public Art Gallery).Entwisle, 1990, pp. 30, 31; reproduced, colour p. 65; black & white p. 116.

It was written by Paul Levitz, and pencilled primarily by Greg LaRocque, Larry Mahlstedt and Mike DeCarlo. The story arc includes the induction of five new members of the Legion of Super-Heroes, with the identity of one posing a major mystery. Plot With its three founders (Cosmic Boy, Saturn Girl and Lightning Lad) having announced their intention to resign from active duty,Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 3, #12 (July 1985) the Legion of Super-Heroes holds its first major membership drive in years. Power Boy, Comet Queen, Mentalla, Energy Boy and Dev-Em are among the various candidates. Ultimately, five new members are voted in, including the telepathic/telekinetic Tellus, the extradimensional entity Quislet, Cosmic Boy's younger brother Magnetic Kid, and Legion of Substitute Heroes co-founder Polar Boy,After his application for membership in the Legion of Super-Heroes was rejected, Polar Boy co-founded the Legion of Substitute Heroes, along with fellow rejected applicants Night Girl, Stone Boy, Fire Lad, and Chlorophyll Kid. ‚Äì Adventure Comics #306 (March 1963) who finally accepts the Legion's long-standing offer of membership. The fifth new member is Sensor Girl. She is a masked woman who keeps her powers and identity secret, but is voted in based upon a recommendation from Saturn Girl, who states that she ‚Äúhas the best of reasons to deserve Legion membership.‚Äù Over the new few weeks, Sensor Girl displays a variety of powers. She is aware of an explosion occurring miles away before any of her teammates, illuminates the darkness with infra-red light, and displays impressive prowess in hand-to-hand combat.Legion of Super- Heroes vol. 3, #16 (November 1985) She properly analyzes the glandular imbalance in one of her teammates,Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 3, #17 (December 1985) and is able to see and hear through walls.Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 3, #20 (March 1986) Brainiac 5, grieving the death of his longtime love Supergirl,The original incarnation of Supergirl was killed by the Anti-Monitor in Crisis on Infinite Earths #7 (October 1985). begins to suspect that Sensor Girl might actually be Supergirl ‚Äî or a traitor in their midst. The mystery deepens when Brainiac 5 breaks into her quarters and discovers that she has been flying without using her Legion flight ring.Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 3, #21 (April 1986) Team leader Element Lad is reluctant to ask Sensor Girl to reveal her identity, as years earlier he was also admitted into the Legion on Saturn Girl's recommendation alone.Adventure Comics #307 (April 1963) However, as teammates grow suspicious and internal conflict develops, he is forced to raise the subject with Sensor Girl. She responds by resigning from the team. As she leaves Legion Headquarters, Ultra Boy uses his penetra-vision to see through her mask, and is stunned when he discovers that her costume is empty.Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 3, #24 (July 1986) Meanwhile, the Emerald Empress has reformed the Fatal Five,The original Fatal Five disbanded some time after Tharok was seemingly destroyed (along with his clone, the Dark Man) following one of the group‚Äôs failed attempts to defeat the Legion. ‚Äì Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 2, #269-271 (November 1980 ‚Äì January 1981) recruiting the Persuader (her former teammate), along with Legion reject Mentalla, and two additional criminals: Caress, a woman with an acidic touch, and Flare, a woman with destructive energy blasting powers and flight. The Legionnaires desperately search for Sensor Girl, worried that she might have accepted the Empress‚Äô previous offer of alliance. Dawnstar tracks her to the cemetery planet Shanghalla, where the trail dissipates. Element Lad raises the subject of Sensor Girl's qualifications with Saturn Girl. She reiterates that Sensor Girl deserves Legion membership, adding that \\"she was already a Legionnaire.\\" On the planet Stratus, the new Fatal Five ambushes and attacks a small faction of Legionnaires (who were, ironically, searching for Mentalla), made up of Dream Girl, Colossal Boy, Tellus, and Polar Boy. Despite fighting valiantly, the four Legionnaires are overpowered and on the verge of losing. Sensor Girl arrives and leaps to the defense of her teammates, but she too is overcome by the Empress, who exposes the mystery woman's true identity: Projectra. Brainiac 5 finally deduces Sensor Girl's identity, which is confirmed by Saturn Girl. Projectra had traveled to Shanghalla to visit the tomb of her late husband Karate Kid,Karate Kid was killed battling expelled Legionnaire Nemesis Kid on the planet Orando. ‚Äì Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 3, #4 (November 1984) who tutored her in hand-to-hand combat. She was able to fly without the aid of her new Legion flight ring by using the one she received when she originally joined the team years earlier.Sensor Girl received a flight ring when she first joined the Legion as Princess Projectra in Adventure Comics #346 (July 1966). Her other seemingly endless abilities were the result of her illusion-casting powers, magically heightened by the spirits of her ancestors to include the ability to see through reality's illusions ‚Äî including those of size, distance, time and death. Desiring to return to the Legion in secret, she and Saturn Girl developed the Sensor Girl identity. Projectra (who re-adopts her Sensor Girl persona) and the other Legionnaires, having escaped from the Fatal Five, are forced to engage them in battle once again. As in the previous fight, the Legion members take a vicious beating from the Fatal Five, but do their best to fight on. However, they all soon realize that Mentalla is a mole in the Fatal Five, and has not truly betrayed the Legion. Using her powers, she possesses Flare and the Empress, using the former to destroy communication jamming satellites around the planet, and the latter to send out a distress call to the Legion via the Legionnaires' flight rings (the Empress had taken the flight rings from them at the beginning of the second battle to prevent them from escaping a second time). In retaliation, the Empress murders Mentalla. The psychic backlash from her death incapacitates Tellus, removing him from the battle. The two teams fight again, with the Legionnaires, now less one member, once again being brutally routed by the villains. One by one, the remaining Legionnaires are defeated. Only Sensor Girl is left. She is eventually able to single-handedly defeat both the Persuader and Flare before being overcome by the Empress and Caress. However, Wildfire and Dawnstar, having received the distress call, arrive, with Wildfire blasting and incapacitating the Emerald Eye, and Dawnstar defeating Caress. Sensor Girl, with her last bit of energy, punches out the Empress, thus ending the battle. Afterward, Projectra abdicates the throne of Orando.Projectra became the reigning monarch of her homeworld in Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 2, #288 (June 1982). The Legion officially votes her into the Legion again as Sensor Girl, accepting her role in the death of Nemesis Kid as a case of self-defense.As Queen of Orando, Projectra executed Nemesis Kid in combat. ‚Äì Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 3, #5 (December 1984) Post-Zero Hour In post-Zero Hour continuity, a snake-like non-humanoid named Sensor joins the team, possessing illusion-casting powers similar to those in Projectra's original incarnation.Legionnaires #43 (December 1996) Post- Infinite Crisis In the aftermath of the Infinite Crisis miniseries, most of the Legion's original continuity has been restored. Elements of the Sensor Girl mystery are once again part of Legion history. Sensor Girl's supposed connection to Supergirl is removed, as the current incarnation of the Girl of Steel has not been killed. Reception The mystery of Sensor Girl's identity produced much reader speculation. Greg LaRocque's art in the series was praised in The Slings & Arrows Comic Guide, and Hassan Yusuf recommended a number of issues from this storyline as highlights in a review covering all volumes of the Legion of Super Heroes.

On September 26, 2014, Screaming Headless Torsos released the much anticipated Code Red, their first new record in 9 years. The album is true to the Torsos gumbo of styles but marks some noticeable sonic progressions. The 11-song album features guest artists and a new vocal sound. Code Red is the first Torsos record featuring vocals and vocal arrangements by lead singer Freedom Bremner. The album was produced by Torsos veteran producer Gregg Fine with, three tracks \\"Code Red\\", \\"Wizard of Woo\\", and Sideways, being co-produced by 14 time Grammy award winning producer, Ron Saint Germain (Muse, Living Colour, Michael Jackson, 311, Diana Ross).

Historically the Torsos' music mixes and mashes guitar-driven rock, jazz, hip- hop, funk, soul, r&b;, reggae, and drum-and-bass grooves and concepts, along with future-shock percussion, improvisation, acrobatic vocals, and most recently Fiuczynski's eastern, Arabic, and African, microtonal guitar influences. SHT's original line up was guitarist David Fiuczynski, vocalist Dean Bowman, bassist Fima Ephron, percussionist Daniel Sadownick, and drummer Jojo Mayer (Nerve). Drummer Gene Lake joined the Torsos, replacing Jojo Mayer for their 2001 album Live!! and the album \\"Torsos 2005\\". In 2001 vocalist Freedom Bremner replaced Dean Bowman. He joined the band officially in 2004 and was featured along with Dean Bowman on the album \\"Torsos 2005\\". Fima Ephron, featured on all the Torsos' albums, left the band in 2004 replaced briefly by bassist Steve Jenkins until 2008 and the entrance of David Ginyard. Screaming Headless Torsos has also featured many of New York's top musicians during their live performances including Sofia Ramos (vocals), John Medeski, (keyboards), rapper Ahmed Best, and Reggie Washington, (bass). The Torsos' rhythm section has also at times served as the backing band for artist, Meshell Ndegeocello, for both live in concert and on her early recordings. Prior to the release of Code Red, Screaming Headless Torsos toured heavily in Mexico and Latin America and sporadically in Europe, but was absent in the United States. After 5 years without releasing new music, SHT released the single and companion video for the song, \\"Dead Christmas Trees\\" in 2010. In March 2012 SHT was invited to play Vive Latino 2012 in Mexico City, the largest indie Rock Festival in the Americas. It was the beginning of a resurgence for the band. As a result of that performance at Vive Latino, which aired on Coca-Cola television throughout Latin America, SHT was invited to Colombia's Jazz al Parque Festival and on September 9, 2012, SHT performed for an audience of 20,000 at the festival in Bogot√° Colombia, the largest jazz festival in South America. At that show SHT introduced a new keyboard player/vocalist, Akie Bermiss, from the New York City band Abaraki. Currently, the band is touring and promoting Code Red.

The NPC receives UK-wide and international referrals of all forms of suspected CJD or other prion diseases. It is internationally unique and has developed considerable experience in the clinical management of prion disease. In addition to providing a national NHS centre of expertise for the management of all forms of CJD and other prion diseases, the clinic was established to facilitate research in both diagnostics and therapeutics including the organisation of clinical trials.Collinge J, Gorham M, Hudson F, Kennedy A, Keogh G, Pal S, Rossor M, Rudge P, Siddique D, Spyer M, Thomas D, Walker S, Webb T, Wroe S, and Darbyshire J.

With some of these large pedigrees a clinical relationship has been fostered for around two decades since mutations in the prion protein gene and their use in diagnosis and genetic counseling were first reported from 1989.Collinge J, Harding AE, Owen F, Poulter M, Lofthouse R, Boughey AM, Shah T, Crow TJ.

The objectives of the NPC * To provide inpatient and outpatient services for the comprehensive assessment of all suspected CJD and other prion disease (sporadic, acquired and inherited). The service includes rapid clinical assessment and diagnosis including, neuroimaging, neuropsychology, neurophysiology, molecular genetics, cerebral and tonsil biopsy (including biochemical analysis of prion strain type), CSF markers and the co-ordination of subsequent management of patients and their families, in liaison with local healthcare professionals. * Information, advice, support and counselling for patients and their families, both during investigation, on diagnosis, and long term follow up, working closely with and provide information and support for professionals working with registered patients in their local area. * Advice and support from a clinical nurse specialist, counsellor and consultant staff for patients, families, carers and health professionals including a telephone help-line and email advice. Close liaison with the principal UK patient support groups is critical: particularly the CJD Support Networkhttp://www.cjdsupport.net and the Cure CJD Campaignhttps://www.curecjd.org. * Provide an internationally recognized centre of expertise for prion disease diagnosis and staff training. Also helping to develop national standards for patient management and infection control in hospitals, and provide clinical and scientific input to the activities of several government appointed national committees. * To provide the infrastructure to enable UK clinical trials in prion disease and to facilitate the clinical and other research of the MRC Prion Unit and its collaborators. In 2007 the NPC completed the first large national clinical trial in prion disease, the PRION-1 trial of the experimental prion therapeutic quinacrine. Currently (2020) the NPC is recruiting into the National Prion Monitoring Cohort study which aims to help optimise future clinical trials.

T. McIntosh, first published in August, 1979 in New York by Zebra Books. It is the last book published by the author. Plot Except for radio and television signals, which are tightly screened, it has been over sixty years since the last visitor was allowed into Utopia, a world where everyone was immortal. So that the world's population would not outrun available surface area, marriage has been outlawed (because couples start to want to have a child), lifelong romances discouraged (for pretty much the same reason), and temporary personal relationships favored. Diseases are nonexistent, and cures have been found for all of them. Life involves pleasure and adventure (skiing, scuba diving, parachuting, automobile racing) all day long. The population nevertheless needs an occasional birth, so couples are allowed to have children according to a lottery system, such that the number of births is exactly equal to the number of accidental deaths in a year. The protagonist, Hardy Cronyn, is the first off-worlder to be allowed onto the planet in sixty years. A lot of diplomatic arm wrestling led to the planet's agreement to let him land. He promised to stay out of trouble, be responsible, and not make waves. Above all, stay out of the newspaper headlines. If he has to convene press conferences, they should be scripted, and he should not say anything off the cuff, or vaguely likely to make a disturbance. But one step off the spaceship and onto the tarmac, he does the unthinkable, and the government is suddenly plunged into damage control mode before it's too late. 1979 British novels 1979 science fiction novels Utopian novels ","title":"A Planet Called Utopia"},{"id":"25159075","title":"List of Estonian football transfers winter 2009‚Äì10"},{"id":"25159083","text":"Bassey Ewa-Henshaw is a Nigerian politician who was elected Senator for the Cross River South constituency of Cross River State in 2003, and was reelected in 2007.

He serves on committees on Millennium Development Goals, Federal Character & Inter-Government Affairs, Federal Capital Territory, Employment, Labour & Productivity and Water Resources. Before his election, in December 2002, Henshaw said of the onshore/offshore dichotomy bill that the president President Olusegun Obasanjo must have a genuine reason for refusing to sign the bill. In October 2004 Bassey Ewa-Henshaw presented a report from the Senate Committee on Employment, Labour and Productivity, discussing possible strikes related to gasoline price hikes. He noted that imports were required because refineries were running below capacity due to power shortages and other factors, but even at full capacity refinery output would be 18 million litres daily while the national demand was for 30 million litres. In June 2008, the Senate yesterday ordered another investigation into the cancellation of the Escravos GTL project in the Niger Delta due to escalating cost estimates. Henshaw supported the motion and advocated extending the probe to other gas projects, a proposal that was rejected. In a mid-term assessment of Nigerian Senators published by the Thisday, the newspaper noted that Bassey Henshaw sponsored the Nigerian Investment Fund for Future Generation Bill 2008, Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill 2008, Petroleum Act (Amendment) Bill 2008, Bureau of Public Enterprises Act (Amendment) Bill 2008 and Binding Resolution of the National Assembly Bill. He sponsored and co-sponsored a number of motions, especially during the Halliburton bribery scandal. The article described his contributions as incisive.

(16 June 1848 ‚Äì 8 September 1918), was a German Roman Catholic priest and the founder of the Society of the Divine Savior, commonly called the Salvatorians. His life is currently under review by the Holy See, for his possible canonization. Life Early life He was born John Baptist Jordan in the town of Gurtweil, in the Grand Duchy of Baden (now part of the city of Waldshut-Tiengen, Germany), the second son of Lorenz Jordan and Notburga Peter. Although he felt called to serve as a priest as an early age, the poverty of the family did not allow him to do the required studies. Instead he became an itinerant laborer and painter. Through his travels throughout Germany, he became aware of the effects of the German government's official policies restricting the activities of the Catholic Church, known as the Kulturkampf, which was resulting in the loss of many of the faithful. Finally spurred by the situation, Jordan gave up his work and began the academic studies required for Holy Orders. He initially had private lessons from local clergy and then attended a secondary school in Constance. Despite his struggle with the sciences, he developed a talent for foreign languages. For his graduation examination, he presented one essay in eight European languages and another one in four other languages. Having successfully completed his initial studies, he then proceeded to enroll at the Albert-Ludwigs University in Freiburg to do his higher studies in the fields of theology and philology. After receiving his degree from the university, he enrolled in the nearby St. Peter Seminary Priest and founder On 21 July 1878, he was ordained a priest for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Freiburg. He was then sent by the archbishop to Rome to study Greek and Semitic languages. During this period, he had a growing conviction that he was being called by God to found a new apostolic work in the Church, which had as its goal the unification of groups of priests and laity in spreading and defending the Catholic faith throughout the world. This conviction became even stronger during a trip to the Middle East in 1880. After returning to Rome, Jordan started implementing his idea of founding a community of members under religious vows and laypeople. This would be organized into three groups, called \\"grades‚Äù: the first would be those who committed to leave everything and, living in community, devote their whole lives to the mission of the organization; the second was to be for academics, who spread the faith by publications; and the third for those laypeople who, remaining in their families and within the reality of their everyday life, would proclaim the Savior through the witness of a good Christian life. On 8 December 1881 in Rome, he founded a community of the first format, initially called the Apostolic Teaching Society, soon called the Catholic Teaching Society, at that time taking the religious name by which he is now known. =Salvatorian Sisters= That following April, an advertisement for the new Society was answered by Baroness Maria Therese von W√ºllenweber (1833-1907), an aristocratic young woman who had long felt a call to serve in the mission life which had been unfilled by the religious Orders she had explored. Jordan visited her in July 1882 and she committed herself to the life of the new Society, becoming its first female member. Jordan established a community of Religious Sisters of the Catholic Teaching Society in Rome in 1883 under the leadership of Mother Frances of the Cross (Amalia Streitel), but had W√ºllenweber remain in Germany. Problems arose, however, between Jordan and this community and these Sisters separated from the Society, going on to become the Sisters of the Sorrowful Mother, an international religious congregation, particularly committed to health care. In 1888 Jordan asked W√ºllenweber to move to Rome, where she and two companions took religious vows on 8 December of that year, receiving the religious habit from Jordan. She then became known as Mother Mary of the Apostles. Mother Mary of the Apostles was beatified on October 13, 1968, and her liturgical commemoration is celebrated on September 5 (the day she professed her vows as the first female member of the Apostolic Teaching Society). Expansion While communities of the Catholic Teaching Society were being established throughout Europe, in 1890 the Holy See entrusted the region of Assam in British India to the spiritual care of the Society. Jordan then established the first community of the Fathers and Religious Brothers of the Society outside of Europe. Mother Mary of the Angels sent Sisters to work with the women and children of the new Indian mission the following year. In 1892 Jordan accepted the request of Ambrose Oschwald, a priest from Baden, who had led a group of people from that region to Wisconsin, in the United States, in order to form a Christian communal way of life. The Salvatorians then became established in that country, founding the former John F. Kennedy Preparatory High School from the group's property. In 1893, he gave his religious communities the names Society of the Divine Savior and Congregation of the Sisters of the Divine Savior. They were soon known as \\"Salvatorians\\" from the Latin word for \\"Savior\\", salvator. Death Due to the outbreak of World War I, and the restrictions it imposed on the communications of the Society, its administration was moved to Tafers, Switzerland, a neutral nation. Jordan died there on 8 September 1918. Veneration & Beatification In 1942 the process for Jordan's canonization was introduced to the Holy See. As part of this process, in 1956 his body was exhumed, examined and transferred to the Salvatorian motherhouse in Rome. On 14 January 2011, Pope Benedict XVI authorized the Congregation for the Causes of Saints to publish the decree on the heroicity of his virtues, granting him the title of Venerable. On 19 June 2020, Pope Francis approved Jordan's beatification and decreed the validity of a miracle gained through the intercession of Fr. Jordan ‚Äì in 2014 in Jundiai, Brazil, a yet-to-be-born child, whose parents were members of a group of Lay Salvatorians, prayed through Jordan's intercession for the health of their child, who was expected to be born with serious skeletal deformities, according to the testings and the doctors. The parents asked the Salvatorian community to join them in their prayer. The child was born on 8 September 2014, the Feast of the Birth of the Blessed Mother, and the anniversary of Fr. Jordan's death. The Beatification ceremony is scheduled for May 15, 2021, at the Basilica of St. John Lateran in Rome. Legacy Today the Salvatorian Fathers and Brothers number about 1,300 and have a presence in 40 countries around the world, represented on every continent. The Salvatorian Sisters currently number about 1,200 members serving in nearly 30 countries.

The feat earned Conner the nickname of \\"Boy Wonder\\", a label that stuck with him throughout his legislative career. Conner represented Bradford County while serving in the lower house. In 1958, at the age of 28, he was elected as the youngest Speaker of the House. On January 2, 1961, Doyle Conner was inaugurated as Commissioner of Agriculture, succeeding Lee Thompson who assumed the post of interim Commissioner upon Nathan Mayo's death in office. Conner went on to serve as Florida's Agriculture for the next 30 years. During his tenure as Commissioner, Conner oversaw efforts to eliminate the giant African snail, hog cholera, the Mediterranean fruit fly, and the cattle screwworm. During the 1980's, Conner was embroiled in political controversy regarding the lethal citrus canker disease and Florida citrus nurseries. While serving in this post he served under 7 Governors of Florida.Accomplishments as Commissioner of Agriculture Conner retired in 1991, and was active in Florida 4-H for much of his remaining life. He was inducted into the Florida Agriculture Hall of Fame in 1985, the Florida Citrus Hall of Fame in 1991, and the Florida 4-H Hall of Fame in 2002. Death Doyle Conner died at a nursing home in Monticello, Florida on December 16, 2012, one day before his 84th birthday.

She was originally built as the nuclear-powered general cargo ship Mutsu, but never carried commercial cargo.http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/27/029/27029493.pdf  History   Development and construction   Mutsu (1972‚Äì1996)  The reactor was completed on 25 August 1972, and fuel was loaded on 4 September. Good overview of the construction, leak, and lessons learnt. When officials announced that the first test run was to be run at the pier in ≈åminato, local protests forced them to reconsider. Eventually it was decided to test the ship in the open ocean, east of Cape Shiriya. The ship departed ≈åminato on 26 August 1974, and the reactor attained criticality on 28 August. =Radiation accident= As the crew brought the reactor up to 1.4% of capacity at 5pm on 1 September 1974, there was a minor shielding inadequacy that permitted the escape of neutrons and gamma rays from the reactor shielding enclosure. Westinghouse Electric Corporation had reviewed the design and warned of this possibility, but no changes were made to the design. There was no significant radiation exposure, but it became a political issue, with local fisherman blocking her return to port for more than 50 days. The government finally came to an agreement with the local government and fishermen; the Mutsu was allowed back to port on condition that it was to find a new home port, and the ship returned to ≈åminato on 15 October. In Sasebo, between 1978 and 1982, various modifications were made to the reactor shield of the Mutsu, and its home port was moved to Sekinehama in 1983. Following an overhaul, the Mutsu was completed in February 1991. She then completed her original design objective of travelling in testing, and was decommissioned in 1992. Over 25 years the programme had cost more than 120 billion yen (about US$ 1.2 billion).  Mirai (1996‚Äìpresent)  After removing the reactor in 1995 and decontaminating the vessel, Mutsu was rebuilt as the ocean observation vessel Mirai.

G√≥mez currently works between London and New York City. Early life and education He completed his primary and secondary education at Colegio San Carlos, a bilingual private school which he attended from 1981 to 1992 in Bogot√°, Colombia. After graduating from high school, G√≥mez enrolled in the Architecture School of Bogot√°'s Universidad de Los Andes and eventually continued and completed his studies at Jorge Tadeo Lozano University from 1994 to 1999, earning a Professional (Bachelor of Arts) Degree in Advertising with an emphasis in Graphic Design. While at advertising school, G√≥mez decided to put all his efforts into pursuing a career in photography. However, his work in the medium dates as early as 1989, when he was 15 years old. During 1991‚Äì1992 (his last two high school years), this dedication grew significantly, and he spent almost every day after school in the darkroom, processing film rolls he had shot with a complete 35mm kit. Gomez's initial photographic interests were based on deadpan views of the street, architecture and urban landscapes. Later on, while working as an assistant photographer (while still being a university student), G√≥mez established direct contact with commercial photography, agencies, fashion shoots and larger productions. In 1998, he upgraded from the smaller 35mm film format to medium format and large format, and by 2000 started working with digital photography. As a consequence of the exploration of the possibilities these formats gave, his body of work evolved and embraced broader topics. Career G√≥mez's first editorial commission was for Architectural Digest Magazine / Latin American Edition. He provided work for almost every major publication in Bogot√° for more than 5 years and for advertising agencies such as Lowe & Partners/SSP3, (now MullenLowe Group), Bates and Ogilvy & Mather. Subsequently his photographs were featured in some of the most important Colombian magazines: Fucsia, Cromos, SoHo (magazine), Estilo Fedco, Donjuan (magazine), Axxis, Semana, and Rolling Stone, (North Cone edition). His editorial work covered fashion, portraiture, architecture, stills and reportage. His photography work for architect Giancarlo Mazzanti was also featured in The Phaidon Atlas of Contemporary World Architecture.The Phaidon Atlas of Contemporary World Architecture (Seccion Sur America] and G√≥mez's work has also been published in Avianca's magazine, and El Tiempo. In addition, G√≥mez lectured on different levels of photography at Bogot√°'s most important universities for 7 years. He worked for the Fine Art, Media, Graphic Design, Advertising and Engineering schools of Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Polit√©cnico Grancolombiano, Jorge Tadeo Lozano University, Central University and Francisco Jos√© de Caldas District University. He was also offered a place as a photography lecturer in the Fine Arts School of the Universidad de Los Andes by Carolina Franco (then dean of the Fine Arts School), shortly after having already decided to travel to the United States, the U.K. and continental Europe to focus on his personal work and expand his international experience. Some of the editorial portrait subjects from G√≥mez's career have ranged from Colombian ex-president √Ålvaro Uribe V√©lez and politician and diplomat Noem√≠ San√≠n, to race car driver Juan Pablo Montoya and alternative rock band Aterciopelados. G√≥mez has lived and worked previously in Los Angeles, and London, England where he worked as a freelance photographer for ASOS.com. He is currently based in New York City. In addition to his photography career, G√≥mez is actively involved in artistic and curatorial projects, and in photographic education. G√≥mez works mainly with Mamiya RZ67, Sinar and Canon Inc. equipment.

It is associated with Crouzon syndrome, Angelman syndrome, as well as fetal alcohol syndrome. It can also be associated with cleft lip and cleft palate. Some people could develop it due to poor dental extractions. Signs and symptoms The underdevelopment of the bones in the upper jaw, which gives the middle of the face a sunken look. This can make it difficult to eat and can cause future problems for the patient, such as nasopharyngeal airway restriction, which can then lead to back pain, neck pain, and numbness in the hands and arms, due to constant forward head posture. This restriction can also lead to sleep apnea and snoring. Sleep apnea can lead to heart problems, endocrine problems, increased weight, and cognition problems, among other issues. Treatment Corrective surgery is the most common treatment to correct this disorder. It involves the repositioning of the upper jaw to align with the lower jaw, to provide symmetry. It is best performed during childhood, if possible, to allow the jaw to recover and develop. The surgery may be performed in consultation with an Orthodontist who works on repositioning the teeth in the mouth. Recovery The recovery time after the surgery depends on the extent of the surgery itself. Patients are usually advised to eat soft foods for days, or sometimes weeks, to allow their jaw time to heal. They also require regular checkups with the doctor to monitor bone displacement, signs of infection, or other issues.

The former emperor had, at least in name, abdicated in favor of someone else. Although technically no longer the reigning sovereign, there are instances where the retired emperor continued to exert considerable power, if not more than the reigning emperor.  History  Origin The honorific was first bestowed by Qin Shi Huangdi (depicted) to King Zhuangxiang of Qin The title Taishang Huangdi was first used when Qin Shi Huangdi bestowed it upon his deceased father, King Zhuangxiang. Development Emperor Gaozu of Han had also bestowed the title Taishang Huangdi on his then-living father Liu Taigong. He bestowed it onto his father to express filial piety. It was also intended to preserve the social hierarchy between father and son, as the former was a commoner and the latter was a dynastic founder. In 301, during the War of the Eight Princes, Sima Lun became the emperor by forcing his puppet Emperor Hui of Jin to become the Taishang Huang. The title had strictly served as an honorific before, but it had become a tool of political infighting over the course of this incident. Another significant occurrence of development was in 399, when L√º Guang of Later Liang abdicated. L√º Guang was old and had become mortally ill, but he wished to secure the transition of imperial power to his designated heir (the eldest son from his main consort) in the presence of another son who was older and posed a threat to the legitimate succession. Even though L√º Guang failed in his efforts, this incident was the earliest example where imperial retirement served as a method to secure succession. During the Northern and Southern dynasties, this institution was employed by non-Han regimes in the north as a strategy to cast away from the tradition of the horizontal succession in favor of the Han tradition of a male primogenitor pattern of succession. In contrast, due to their Han heritage, the southern regimes had no need to make use and never employed the institution as a means to stabilize successions. In 617, Li Yuan (later Emperor Gaozu of Tang) bestowed the title Taishang Huang upon Emperor Yang of Sui in absentia. Here, Li Yuan used the honorific as a legitimating cover for his seizure of power, in which the newly-installed Yang You served as his puppet emperor. In 626 during the Xuanwu Gate Incident, Prince Li Shimin of Tang led his armed men in a coup for the throne. During the course of the coup, he succeeded in killing his rival brothers, Crown Prince Li Jiancheng and Prince Li Yuanji. Within three days, Emperor Gaozu created Li Shimin as his heir. On the ninth day of the eight month, Emperor Gaozu abdicated in favor for his son Li Shimin (who became Emperor Taizong). He remained as Taishang Huang until his death in 635. He would only appear for ceremonial functions at court. Also in 705 AD, Empress Wu Zetian took the title for her son, Emperor Zhongzong, and abdicated in his favor. also in 712, Emperor Ruizong of the Tang dynasty retired in favor for his son who became Emperor Xuanzong. Although Emperor Ruizong still held full power for a year because of his beloved sister's great influential and position, when Princess Taiping committed suicide in a power struggle with Emperor Xuanzong, he handed over full power to her son. In 756, during the An Lushan Rebellion, Emperor Xuanzong went into retirement while he was in Shu (present-day Sichuan). His son, who was leading a military campaign in the northeast of Gansu at the time, would ascend the throne as Emperor Suzong. Modern usage In modern Chinese history after 1949, Deng Xiaoping has been called Taishang Huang in a pejorative context because he wielded much of his power without assuming the titles normally taken on by China's paramount leader, and because he belonged to Mao Zedong's generation of leaders but wielded influence over leaders who were a generation below him. The term has also been applied to other Communist Party senior officials without formal titles who were seen as meddling in the affairs of their successors, such as Chen Yun and Jiang Zemin.

It is a chronicle of the political tension in Chile in 1973 and of the violent counter revolution against the democratically elected government of Salvador Allende. It won the Grand Prix in 1975 and 1976 at the Grenoble International Film Festival. In 1996, Chile, Obstinate Memory was released and followed Guzm√°n back to Chile as he screened the 3-part documentary to Chileans who had never seen it before. Background The film opens in March 1973 with reporters asking people how they intend to vote in the coming congressional election. The election is taking place after Allende has been in office for over two years and has been trying to reorganize society along democratic socialist lines. His \\"Popular Unity\\" coalition was put into office with only a third of the popular vote. His efforts to nationalize certain industries have met with internal and foreign opposition, and Chile is suffering economic deprivations. In the election Allende makes gains to 43.4 percent of the votes, though the opposition bloc is strong too, up to 56 percent. The film has street interviews, speeches, the violent confrontations, the mobs and meetings, the parades with workers chanting. Part One finishes with newsreel footage from an Argentine cameraman Leonardo Henrichsen who was photographing street skirmishes. A soldier takes aim and kills the cameraman, and the image spins skyward. Part Two - \\"The Coup d'√©tat\\" begins with the right wing violence of the winter of 1973 (June is winter in the southern hemisphere) against the government. Army troops seize control of downtown Santiago - but the attempted coup is snuffed out in a few hours. \\"The film leaps from one group to another ... It shows the different elements in the explosive situation with so much clarity that it's a Marxist tract in which the contradictions of capitalism have sprung to life. We actually see the country cracking open. Step by step, the legal government is overthrown.\\" Pauline Kael, When the Lights Go Down, p.385/386 Everybody in Chile seems to know the coup d'√©tat is coming and talk about it openly - yet the people who have most to lose can't get together enough to do anything. Allende's naval aide-de-camp Arturo Araya is killed, and the camera moves around the funeral attendees - General Augusto Pinochet among them. In July, the truck owners, funded by the CIA, begin their long strike, which paralyzes the distribution of food, gasoline, and fuel, and there is a call for Allende to resign. Instead Allende holds a rally - around 800,000 people arrive, but they have no weapons. On September 11, the Navy institutes the coup d'√©tat, and the Air Force bombs the state radio station. The palace is bombarded from the air. The chiefs of the junta on television are seen announcing they'll return the country to order after three years of \\"Marxist cancer\\".Pauline Kael, When the Lights Go Down, p.385/386 Part Three - \\"Popular Power\\" takes place in 1972-3, prior to the previous two installments. It primarily focuses on the workers' response to the \\"insurrection of the bourgeoise\\" captured in part 1. The workers respond to a strike of the employers and middle-class employees by occupying their factories and, as the strike is prolonged, attempting to run them themselves (autogestion). This leads to the formation of cordones industriales ('industrial belts', a form of workers' council) and opens up a debate on the left about the future of socialism and workers' power in Chile. The film features extensive interviews with Chilean industrial workers. Chile, Obstinate Memory (1996) In Chile, Obstinate Memory, Guzm√°n explores the idea of identity and memory as it relates to the Chilean public. As opposed to The Battle of Chile, Chile, Obstinate Memory focuses more on the personal reflections of the filmmaker on returning to his home country. Whereas the original documentary is in the form of cinema verit√©, Chile, Obstinate Memory is a personal essay film Guzm√°n interviews people involved in the making of The Battle of Chile, speaks with Allende‚Äôs former guards, reflects on his own time being held by the military government, and overall focuses on the individual experiences under such a regime. The film explores the identity of the Chilean people in regards to the political changes of the nation during and after the Pinochet regime. Guzm√°n struggled with the decision to make a personal essay film. In an interview with Jorge Ruffinelli, the filmmaker states that he had planned to go back to Chile and producer Yves Jeanneau suggested that Guzm√°n make his trip the subject of a new film. According to Guzm√°n, ‚ÄúThis frightened me too much, however, to appear as the central focus of a film. So I made the suggestion that it would be better to take advantage of my trip looking for the original characters of The Battle of Chile. That jelled and so the project began. I wrote the first synopsis, with a real lack of confidence because the \\"personal tone\\" wasn't convincing me.‚Äù Eventually the filmmaker found the way to tell this compelling story. Previous to the beginning of the shoot, the director was screening his documentary at a film school in Santiago. As the screening ended, Guzm√°n saw no reaction to his film, ‚Äúno one turned on the light, and no one applauded. I thought that I had picked the wrong film and said to myself, ¬¥these kids must be children of parents who detest the Allende period¬¥, and started moving to the back of the room to turn on the light, as I tried to think of some formula to continue the class. How great was my surprise when I discovered the faces of these young people, all crying, without exception. No one could articulate a single word. In that moment, I understood that the main device of the film had to be the showings of The Battle.‚Äù Guzm√°n wanted to film the reaction of young students to the screening of The Battle of Chile, just as he had experience before the production of Obstinate Memory. He requested permission from 40 schools to do this but only 4 agreed. According to Guzm√°n, the rest of the schools refused because they were concerned about traumatizing the students and some suggested that it was better to forget the past. Critical reception Tim Allen in Village Voice - \\"The major political film of our times - a magnificent achievement.\\" Pauline Kael in The New Yorker - \\" How could a team of five - some with no previous film experience - working with ... one √âclair camera, one Nagra sound recorder, two vehicles..and a package of black-and-white film stock sent to them by the French documentarian Chris Marker produce a work of this magnitude? The answer has to be partly, at least; through Marxist discipline ... The young Chilean director and his associates had a sense of purpose. The twenty hours of footage they shot had to be smuggled out of the country..the cameraman, Jorge M√ºller, hasn't been heard of since his imprisonment. The others fled separately, assembled in Cuba, and together with a well known Chilean film editor Pedro Chaskel, ... worked on the movie ... Aesthetically, this is a major film, and that gives force even to the patterning of its charges ... It needs to be seen on public television, with those [U.S.] government officials who formed policy toward Allende explaining what interests they believed they were furthering.\\" Pauline Kael, When The Lights Go Down, p. 387/388 Andy Beckett in The Guardian ; \\"The film becomes, in part, a study of conservatism and what happens when it is threatened. [-]Pinochet's slyness is well illustrated by a glimpse of him a few months before the coup, sunglasses on, helmet pulled down, dressed like an ordinary soldier as he saunters amicably along with some other officers, who are still loyal to the government and have just put down a premature army rebellion. Meanwhile, the difference between Allende's \\"Chilean road to socialism\\" and more authoritarian, Soviet-inspired versions - a difference denied to this day by Pinochet's supporters - is made disarmingly clear by a confrontation between Allende and a crowd of left-wingers, who are chanting for him to close down parliament. He refuses, and the protesting whistles are fierce for a time. Then the crowd goes quiet and listens.\\" The Guardian, 14 September 2002  See also  * Cinema of Chile References External links * The Battle of Chile at Icarus Films  1970s documentary films 1975 films 1976 films 1979 films Chilean black-and-white films Chilean documentary films Chilean films Chile‚ÄìUnited States relations Cultural depictions of Salvador Allende Documentary films about historical events Documentary films about Latin American military dictatorships Documentary films about politicians Films directed by Patricio Guzm√°n Films about coups d'√©tat ","title":"The Battle of Chile"},{"id":"25159309","text":"Siege of Esztergom may refer to *Siege of Esztergom (1241) *Siege of Esztergom (1543) *Siege of Esztergom (1596) ","title":"Siege of Esztergom"},{"id":"25159330","text":"Luigi Serafini (6 June 1808 ‚Äì 1 February 1894) was a Roman Catholic bishop and cardinal.

The system started out as a weak area of low pressure (an Aleutian Low), that formed in the northern Gulf of Alaska on October 7. Late on October 11, the system quickly absorbed Melor's remnant moisture, which resulted in the system strengthening significantly offshore, before moving southeastward to impact the West Coast of the United States, beginning very early on October 13.http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=10/13/2009&selmap;=2009101306&maptype;=satsfcnps Around the same time, an atmospheric river opened up (the Pineapple Express), channeling large amounts of moisture into the storm, resulting in heavy rainfall across California and other parts of the Western United States. Meteorological synopsis On October 7, an extratropical disturbance developed over the northern Gulf of Alaska, at the end of the warm front of a weakening extratropical system. During the next couple of days, the system slowly strengthened, before undergoing explosive intensification on October 9, over southern Alaska.http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=10/09/2009&selmap;=2009100921&maptype;=satsfcnps Late on October 11, the extratropical cyclone absorbed the disorganized remnant of Typhoon Melor, causing the system's intensification to accelerate.

Numerous locations recorded rainfall in excess of in a 24-hour span, with a maximum of falling at Mining Ridge, Monterey County. This amount surpassed the previous rainfall record from a tropical cyclone or its remnants in the state by nearly . Hurricane Kathleen in 1976 held the record prior to Melor, producing a maximum of at San Gorgonio Mountain. In San Francisco, an all-time record was set of in a 24-hour span, greater than any other total since records began in 1849. At higher elevations, significant amounts of snow fell; exact totals are not known, but estimated to be at least several feet. Strong winds also accompanied the record rainfall. Hurricane-force wind gusts, recorded up to , were associated with Melor's remnants. Similar winds were likely felt in higher elevations, resulting in blizzard conditions. Although the rainfall was record-breaking, it significantly helped to alleviate one of California's worst droughts on record, spanning several years. Rainfall from the storm system also helped extinguish several wildfires that were burning in California at that time, including the large Station Fire. At San Marcos Pass, rainfall from the storm surpassed the all-time record October rainfall in a single day, with falling at the pass. In areas near San Francisco, hundreds of car accidents occurred due to wet roads and high winds. On the Richmond Bridge, a tractor-trailer was blown on its side, landing on a passing car; however, the two passengers of the car and the truck driver were uninjured. This accident resulted in all east-bound lanes on the bridge being shut down from 3:00 pm to 5:30 pm. The California Highway Patrol stated that they received over 3,000 calls during the first half of the day concerning accidents, against the normal 1,000 calls during an entire day without rain. A crash in the Caldecott Tunnel, requiring emergency repairs to the structure, led to a temporary closure and creating more traffic issues. A three car collision on state Highway 1 resulted in the death of one person. The section of the highway near the crash was shut down for near four hours also. Over 200 accidents occurred throughout the day around San Francisco due to the storm. Throughout the Santa Cruz Mountains, several roads were closed due to flooding. Along Swanton Road, emergency officials issued a mandatory evacuation of 60 residents due to the flooding. Schools in San Lorenzo Valley were closed for the day due to the rising waters. Some residents were trapped by waters reaching a depth of , leading to emergency rescues. High winds resulted in major air traffic delays, with officials noting average delays of three or more hours. At the height of the storm, more than 35,000 residences were without power initially due to heavy rain; however, wind eventually worsened power issues, as branches began to fall on power lines. A transmission emergency was declared on the evening of October 12 as a 500,000 volt power line was blown down. In northern portions of the state, winds exceeding left hundreds of thousands of people without power and sparked several power line fires. The storm was described as \\"just phenomenal\\" by meteorologists. In response to the storm, flood disaster agencies allocated 20,000 sandbags for immediate deployment. All state and emergency operation centers in the state were activated on October 14, and support from electric companies in Arizona and Nevada was received to assist in power restoration. Other states In Oregon, the remnants of Melor brought heavy rains and high winds to many areas. Maximum rainfall associated with the system was around , making the remnants of Melor the third known tropical cyclone, or remnants of a cyclone, to impact state. Minor effects were recorded in terms of damage: one rockslide took place on Highway 101 and large swells affected the coastline. In mountainous areas of Nevada, the storm produced upwards of of snow and winds over . Several accidents took place on slick roadways during the storm; however, no fatalities or major injuries were reported. The highest winds were at the peaks of the Sierra mountains, which reached , equivalent to a strong Category 4 hurricane. At least of rain fell along the foothills of the mountains, making the remnants of Melor one of the wettest former tropical cyclones to impact the state of Nevada. In Minnesota, a region rarely affected by the remnants of tropical cyclones, the jet stream carried moisture from the system into the state, causing the region to receive moderate rainfall from the storm system. On October 14 and 15, moisture from the storm affected the state, with estimated rainfall totals peaking at . Heavy snow fell in parts of Pennsylvania between October 15 and 16. State College, Pennsylvania saw ten inches (254 mm) of wet snow, causing a very memorable Penn State homecoming game, and breaking numerous records, such as earliest recorded snowfall, most severe October snowstorm, and most snow in the month of October. Moderate snow fell between October 15 and 18 in the Northeastern United States, as far as the suburbs of New York City, with light snow being reported in the city itself. Boston suburbs saw moderate, wet snow fall on the morning of October 16, in spots accumulating up to . The area was then hit on October 18, when in the afternoon, heavy rain turned to heavy snow and almost white-out conditions. The ground was too warm for any significant accumulation, but up to were reported at spots between Boston and Lowell. All of the snow melted by October 20.

Born in Stourbridge, Dukes left school at the age of eleven, taking up work as an errand boy. When his family moved to Warrington, he joined working in a forge. He subsequently had a number of casual jobs throughout north west England, including working on the Manchester Ship Canal. In 1909 his career as a trade union official began when he was elected secretary of the Warrington branch of the National Union of Gasworkers. He was a founding member of the British Socialist Party, and was elected to the party's national executive in 1914. During the First World War he was a conscientious objector, serving some time in prison. He became a district secretary in what had become the National Union of General Workers. From 1934 to 1946, Dukes was General Secretary of the National Union of General and Municipal Workers. From 1946 to 1947 he was President of the Trades Union Congress. In 1947 he was appointed a director of the Bank of England. Parliamentary career At the 1923 general election, Dukes was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Warrington in Lancashire, narrowly defeating the sitting Conservative MP Alec Cunningham-Reid. When the First Labour Government fell in 1924, Dukes lost his seat in the resulting 1924 general election, unseated by his predecessor Cunningham-Reid. However, at the 1929 general election, when Cunningham-Reid abandoned Warrington and stood unsuccessfully in Southampton,Craig, op. cit, page 243 Dukes was returned again to the House of Commons. When Labour split in 1931 over the handling of budgetary response to the Great Depression, Dukes was defeated in the subsequent general election, and did not stand for election to the House of Commons again. In 1942 he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire and in 1946 was appointed an adviser to the Paris Peace Conference. Charles Dukes served as the British representative on the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in 1947 and played a part in the drafting of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. He was ennobled in 1947 as Baron Dukeston, of Warrington in the County Palatine of Lancaster, and was an active Labour Party peer. He died the following year in a London hospital, aged 66, without an heir, and the title became extinct. He was buried in Chesham Bois, Buckinghamshire, close to his home in Amersham.

Personal life He was born in Stockholm as a son of professor of geology Waldemar Christofer Br√∏gger (1851‚Äì1940) and Antonie Scheel Siewers (1854‚Äì1933). He was a grandson of the book printer Anton Wilhelm Br√∏gger. In September 1909 he married Inger Ursin (1882‚Äì1941). He had the sons Waldemar Christofer Br√∏gger (1911‚Äì1991) and Niels Christian Br√∏gger (1914‚Äì1966), and through the former, the grandson Jan Br√∏gger. Career Br√∏gger finished his secondary education in 1903, but his higher education was sporadic. Without a formal examination, he wrote the paper √òxer av N√∏stvettypen, which was published in 1905 by the Norwegian Geological Survey. He participated in the archaeological investigations of Svarthola outside Stavanger, and wrote a report on the first paleolithic kitchen midden found in Norway, published in the Annals of Stavanger Museum for 1907. Already in 1909 he completed his Dr.philos. degree with the thesis Den arktiske stenalder i Norge (The Arctic Stone Age in Norway). From 1909 to 1913 he worked as a curator at Stavanger Museum. He wrote a book on the city's medieval history and founded the local branch of the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments. He also became involved in Stavanger Aftenblad and contributed to Dagbladet and Tidens Tegn. He was hired at Universitetets Oldsaksamling at the Royal Frederick University in 1913, and became its director and a professor in 1915. He also contributed via the Institute for Comparative Research in Human Culture, and was a driving force in establishing the Viking Ship Museum. From 1918 to 1934 he chaired Norske Museers Landsforbund, a forerunner of Norges Museumsforbund. He edited the journals Oldtiden, St. Hallvard and Acta Archaeologica, and was also a co- editor for volumes seven through ten of the biographical dictionary Norsk biografisk leksikon. He contributed to the encyclopedia Salmonsens Konversationsleksikon, where he wrote the chapter on the prehistory of Norway. Among his most important works is Ertog og √∏re (1921), where he combined archeological findings with law texts from the Gulating and Frostating. He wanted to become rector of the university, but this did not happen. His father had been rector from 1907 to 1911. Br√∏gger was involved in politics as well-- again like his father. He became a deputy central board member of the Liberal Left Party in 1929, and advanced to deputy chairman already in 1930. The elected chairman, Karl Wefring, was not able to function, and Br√∏gger was therefore acting party chairman until 1931. He then continued as a central board member until 1933, then a deputy member. Representing the constituency of Oslo, he served as a deputy representative to the Parliament of Norway during the 1928‚Äì1930 term, and participated in sessions of the Standing Committee on Finance in May 1928 and April 1930. In 1930 he headed the party ballot, above Ragna H√∏rbye. Neither was elected. He was a member of the Norwegian Association for Women's Rights. Br√∏gger was a member of the Committee for Cultural War Preparedness (), established in 1938 under supervision of the Director for Cultural Heritage, Harry Fett. Shortly after the Second World War broke out in 1939, Br√∏gger initiated a rescue operation to save the most important items from Oldsaksamlingen, which were secretly evacuated and placed in a bank safe at Fagernes. Br√∏gger was also a board member of the National Theatre. In 1941, during World War II and the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, the National Theatre board at one point did not abide by the directions of the Nazi government. Several board members were arrested, including Br√∏gger, who was first suppleant to the board. Unlike the ordinary board members Harald Grieg, Johannes Sejersted B√∏dtker and Francis Bull, he was not sent to Grini concentration camp, but was held at the prison on √Ökebergveien between 28 June and his release on 2 July. However, Br√∏gger was arrested for a second time in September 1941, together with fellow academics Otto Lous Mohr and Didrik Arup Seip. He spent from 11 to 30 September in the prison at M√∏llergata 19, and then was at Grini until 22 October 1942. Both his sons spent time at Grini as well.Giertsen, 1946: p. 29Giertsen, 1946: p. 193 Br√∏gger was a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters from 1914 and the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters from 1927, and was decorated with the Order of St. Olav in 1932. He was a co-founder of the Norwegian Archaeological Society, and served as secretary-general until his death. He was declared an honorary member of Norske Museers Landsforbund. Br√∏gger's health declined during his time in the concentration camp. After the war he returned as a professor, but retired in 1949. His last publication of importance came in 1950: Vikingeskipene. Deres forgjengere og etterf√∏lgere (The Viking Ships: Their Predecessors and Successors), written together with Haakon Shetelig. He died in August 1951.

Philippe Augier became an early supporter of Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing in the aftermath of the events of May 1968. He became the leader of the Giscardian youth organization in 1971. Influenced by a trip to the United States during the 1972 election, he led the Young Giscardians in the 1974 presidential campaign. Its candidate elected to the Elys√©e, he left the presidency of the Young Independent Republicans to Dominique Bussereau and the General Secretariat to Jean-Pierre Raffarin to become national secretary of the Independent Republicans, along with Michel d'Ornano and Michel Poniatowski, and ran against RPR deputy Daniel Goulet in the Orne in the 1981 election. Having abandoned politics in the 1970s and 1980s to join the French Agency for the sale of thoroughbreds, Philippe Augier became a member of the municipal council of Deauville in 1995 as a member of the UDF. He took the reins of the town in 2001, succeeding Anne d'Ornano with almost 70% of the vote. Staunch supporter of the reunification of Normandy, he was the UDF's top candidate in the 2004 regional elections in Basse-Normandie. He won 9.26% and was reluctant to endorse the incumbent UMP President, Ren√© Garrec. Many in the UMP blamed him for the defeat of Garrec by Socialist candidate Philippe Duron. Originally the UDF candidate in the Calvados' 4th constituency against incumbent deputy Nicole Ameline, he dropped out after the defeat of UDF candidate Fran√ßois Bayrou in the presidential election. Reelected Mayor of Deauville with 78.2% of votes in the first round, he became president of the C≈ìur C√¥te Fleurie Communaut√© de communes. Always close to Anne d'Ornano, he originally remained outside the right-wing parties, while cultivating friendships with the MoDem, New Centre and the UMP, and was entrusted by Nicolas Sarkozy the task of writing a report on national cultural and sporting events. In July 2009, he was appointed to be the New Centre's top candidate in the 2010 regional elections in Basse-Normandie.

Maurice FitzGerald defeated and killed Melaghlin O'Donnell. The Annals of the Four Masters describes the battle as follows: A great army was led by Maurice Fitzgerald, and the other English chiefs, first to Sligo, and thence to the cataract (Assaroe Falls) of Aedh Roe, the son of Badharn. Cormac, the son of Dermot, who was son of Roderic O'Conor, joined his muster. This was on the Wednesday after the festival of St Peter and St Paul. O'Donnell assembled the Kinel-Connell and Kinel-Owen against them, so that they did not allow a single man, either English or Irish, to cross the ford of Ath Seanaigh for a whole week. The English then bethought them of sending Cormac O'Conor with a large body of cavalry westwards along the plain, who was to turn southwards through the plain, and then eastwards along the borders of the bog, unperceived by any one, until he should arrive at Bel-atha-Culuain a ford on the Erne. This was accordingly done, and the Kinel-Connell knew nothing of the movement until they saw the body of cavalry advancing on their rear, on their side of the river; they then turned round to them. When the English saw that the attention of the Kinel-Connell was directed towards the cavalry who had advanced on their rear, they rushed across the ford against them, being confident that they the Kinel-Connell would not be able to attend to the attacks of both. The Kinel-Connell were now in the very centre of their enemies, who had surrounded them on every side. O'Donnell was slain on the spot, as well as the Cammhuinealach Wry-necked O'Boyle, the head Chieftain of the Three Tuathas, Mac Sorley, Lord of Argyle, and other chiefs of the Kinel-Connell. A great number of Fitzgerald's forces were slain and drowned here; others of them were drowned northwards in the River Finn, and many others at Termon Daveog, in pursuit of preys that fled before them; and among the rest William Britt, sheriff of Connaught, and his brother, a young knight. The country was then plundered and desolated by them the English, and they left the chieftainship of the Kinel-Connell to Rory O'Canannan on this occasion. The Annals of Lough C√© describes the battle as follows: A great hosting by Maurice Fitz-Gerald, and the foreigners along with him, until they reached Sligech in the first instance, and from thence to Es-Ruaidh-mic-Badhuirn, on the Wednesday after the festival of Paul and Peter; and Cormac, son of Diarmaid, son of Ruaidhri O'Conchobhair, went there in his host and muster. O'Domhnaill assembled the Cenel-Conaill and Cenel-Eoghain to meet him at Bel-atha-Senaigh, so that they allowed neither Foreigners nor Gaeidhel to cross the ford during the space of a whole week; when they determined that Cormac O'Conchobhair should go, with a large force of cavalry, eastwards along the plain, and then turn upwards through the plain by the margin of the bog; and he then proceeded eastwards along the river until he reached Ath-Chuil-uaine on the Erne. And the Cenel- Conaill observed nothing until they saw them approaching on their own side of the river. And when the Foreigners perceived the Cenel-Conaill watching the cavalry in their rear, they themselves rushed across the ford, so that the Cenel-Conaill were placed between both divisions. O'Domhnall was defeated, with his army; and Maelsechlainn O'Domhnaill, king of Cenel-Conaill, was slain there; and the Gilla-muin√©lach O'Baoidhill, and Mac Somhairle, king of Airer- Gaeidhel, and the nobles of the Cenel-Conaill besides, were slain. And many of Fitz-Gerald's army were drowned going northwards across the Finn and many of the same army were slain at Termann-Dabheog, in pursuit of the preys, including William Brit, i.e. the sheriff of Connacht, and a young armed knight who was his brother. However, the entire country was afterwards devastated and plundered by them; and they left the sovereignty of Cenel-Conaill with Ruaidhri O'Canannain on this occasion.

The police believed that much of his alleged ¬£300 million fortune was the result of swindles, violence, racketeering and money laundering. Palmer owned a complex network of 122 companies, many offshore in the Isle of Man, Madeira and the British Virgin Islands, as well as 60 offshore bank accounts.  Early life  Palmer was born in Solihull, Warwickshire, one of seven children.Elizabeth Nash \\"Goldfingered\\" , The Independent, 2 July 1999 Reportedly dyslexic, Palmer left school at 15 and joined his brother Malcolm in a roof tiling business and also sold paraffin from \\"the back of a lorry\\".Jeevan Vasagar and Nick Hopkins \\"King of crime who became as rich as the Queen\\" , The Guardian, 24 May 2000 He married Marnie J. A. Ryan in 1975 in Bristol. He ran a gold and jewellery dealing company, Scadlynn Ltd, in Bedminster, Bristol with business partners Garth Victor Chappell and Terence Edward James Patch. Palmer and Chappell had been arrested in 1980 when they worked together selling furniture. The two men were charged with obtaining credit on furniture by providing false references, with Palmer receiving a six-month suspended prison sentence.  Brink's-Mat involvement and acquittal  In 1985, following the November 1983 Brink's-Mat robbery, Chappell and Patch of Scadlynn Ltd were arrested for their involvement in melting down ¬£26 million worth of gold from the robbery to try to pass it off as legitimate.John Steele \\"Swindler ran empire with army of thugs\\" , telegraph.co.uk, 24 May 2001 Two days after armed robbers Brian Robinson and Micky McAvoy were jailed, Chappell withdrew ¬£348,000 from the company's accounts. Throughout their trial, a total of ¬£1.1 million had been withdrawn. During the raids, one of the suspects refused to confirm what they had been melting that morning. It was revealed that the company had been processing millions of pounds' worth of gold, but claimed it was gold they had purchased themselves. The company's books stated that they were selling the melted gold for virtually the same amount as they had purchased it for‚Äîwhich didn't make sense, unless the records were false. Confiscated documents also showed that the company had been evading tax, and were ordered for pay ¬£80,000 in unpaid tax. Palmer evaded arrest at the time, after fleeing to Tenerife with his family only days prior to his company being raided and its directors arrested. His family returned to England, whilst he sold his remaining assets back home and set up a timeshare business at Island Village, near Playa de las Am√©ricas. He attempted to move to Brazil after Spain signed an extradition treaty with the UK, but he was arrested and his entry refused as he had travelled on an expired passport. Deported back to England, he was forced to face trial. Despite Palmer admitting to melting down gold bars from the robbery in his garden, he was acquitted during the trial in 1987 after claiming that he wasn't aware they were stolen.Giles Tremlett \\"Spanish police hold 'Goldfinger' over claims he led international gang\\" , The Guardian, 13 July 2007 Chappell was sentenced to ten years in the earlier trial. He was reported by The Independent in 1993 as being subject to an asset-freezing Mareva Injunction gained by Brink's-Mat from the High Court of Justice, enabling investigators to track his substantial financial resources.Phil Davison and Michael Prestage \\"Victims of a sunshine fraudster: Britons are being bullied and deceived by a timeshare firm in Tenerife\\" , The Independent, 28 February 1993 He later paid out ¬£360,000 to Lloyd's the insurers as a result of a civil action brought against him, but continued to plead his innocence in the 1987 robbery and in 1999 claimed the authorities were persecuting him. For his connection to the Brink's-Mat robbery, Palmer acquired the sobriquet of 'Goldfinger'.  Conviction for time-share fraud and later events  In 2001, he defended himself after sacking his legal team in one of the longest fraud trials in British legal history. He was found guilty \\"of masterminding the largest timeshare fraud on record\\" and jailed for eight years. It is reported that he swindled 20,000 people out of ¬£30 million, but attempts by the Crown to confiscate this profit were later stopped in a court hearing.John Steele \\"Criminal with Brink's-Mat link arrested in Spain\\" , telegraph.co.uk, 13 July 2007 Sentenced to 8 years, he served just over half of this term. His fortune at the time of his conviction was estimated at about ¬£300 million, but Palmer was declared bankrupt in 2005 with debts of ¬£3.9m. In 2007, he was arrested on charges including fraud. Reportedly, he had been able to continue his criminal activities during his incarceration, following his 2001 conviction. In 2009, after two years without charge in a high security Spanish jail, he was released on bail, but was required to report to court authorities every two weeks. In 2015, it was alleged by The Times from leaked Operation Tiberius files, that Palmer was protected from arrest and investigation by a clique of high-ranking corrupt Metropolitan Police officers. Palmer's companions were reportedly once detained in possession of a silenced Uzi submachine gun and 380 rounds of ammunition. Death Palmer was murdered on 24 June 2015 at the age of 64 in his gated home of South Weald, near Brentwood, Essex by means of gunshot wounds to the chest. The fact he had been shot 6 times was only revealed during a post-mortem as he had undergone open-heart surgery for which the wounds were mistaken. It was later revealed that at the time of his death, Palmer faced charges in Spain for fraud, firearm possession and money laundering. It was only after his death that it was revealed that in addition to his activities in Spain, Palmer also opened the first Russian timeshare company in the 1990s. A special BBC documentary presented by broadcaster Roger Cook revealed that since 1999, police had run an intelligence operation on Palmer from the RAF Spadeadam base in Cumbria. Palmer was under electronic surveillance by a secret police intelligence unit for 16 years until his assassination by a hitman in 2015, according to the special BBC television investigation. The Serious and Organised Crime Agency (Soca), now the National Crime Agency, had gathered intelligence on Palmer in an operation codenamed Alpine because of concerns of corruption in the Metropolitan police.London Evening Standard 26 September 2016 Following his death, it was revealed Palmer's partner Christina Ketley remained under police surveillance following reports from Spanish law enforcement agencies that she played a \\"predominant role\\" in his criminal empire.{cn}} Ketley and fellow mistress Saskia Mundinger, who both had children with Palmer, demanded payouts from him in 2005 to \\"keep them in the lifestyle they became accustomed to\\". He also had two daughters with his wife Marnie. On 4 February 2017, a 50-year-old man was questioned on suspicion of Palmer's murder. Police said they had questioned a man who was originally from Tyneside although currently living in southern Spain. The man was not arrested but volunteered to be interviewed at a police station in the UK. The force did not specify at which police station he was interviewed.

He was a great-grandson of the book printer Anton Wilhelm Br√∏gger, a grandson of geologist Waldemar Christofer Br√∏gger and a brother of writer Niels Christian Br√∏gger. Between 1933 and 1941 he was married to Elin Amalie Thon, and between 1942 and 1948 he was married to Mai Lindeg√•rd. Finally, between 1948 and 1976 he was married to nurse Enid Wesenlund. He is the father of the geneticist Anton Br√∏gger, born 1934, the anthropologist Jan Br√∏gger, born 1936 and Inger Vibeke Br√∏gger Langfeldt, born 1940. Career Br√∏gger took his examen artium in 1930, and took the examen philosophicum at the Royal Frederick University before taking up a career in writing. His d√©but novel was Den evige vilje ('The Eternal Will', 1932). In the following years he lived in London, Capri, Paris and Berlin, but he moved back to Norway in 1937 due to the harsh political climate. He was hired as a journalist in Tidens Tegn, to which he previously had contributed from abroad. He became a theatre critic in 1938, but resigned in 1940. During the Norwegian Campaign, as a part of World War II, he participated in the armed resistance that followed the German invasion. During the subsequent occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany he joined the civil resistance. He was arrested by the Nazi authorities on 15 September 1941. After spending five days at M√∏llergata 19, he sat at Grini concentration camp until 14 March 1942.

Here he published books under the pseudonyms Carsten Frogner and Peter Valentin. The book Den osynliga fronten ('The Invisible Front', 1943) became controversial, as it was published in German language in Switzerland, and information in it could be used to crack down on Norwegian resistance fighters. Br√∏gger was acquitted during the legal purge in Norway after World War II, but sharply criticized in the Norwegian Authors' Union. Nonetheless, Br√∏gger continued his writing career, releasing mainly historical novels and crime novels. He translated dozens of books to Norwegian, including One Thousand and One Nights which was released in six volumes in 1950. He edited or contributed to the encyclopedias Cappelens ettbindsleksikon (1955), Gyldendals navneleksikon (1958), Combi.

The main route runs along the Goethe Way to the Brocken, in places parallel to the Brocken Railway, and from there to K√∂nigsh√ºtte. An alternative route bypasses the Brocken and runs to other features of the Upper Harz Water Regale such as the Oderteich and the Rehberg Ditch. After passing Sankt Andreasberg and Braunlage this path rejoins the main route. From K√∂nigsh√ºtte two alternative routes go to Altenbrak. One way runs through R√ºbeland along the R√ºbeland Railway, the other past the Rappbode Reservoir. From Altenbrak the path continues to Thale, where the Harz Witches' Trail ends. The name of the footpath is derived from the association of a number of sites with witches, including the Brocken and the Hexentanzplatz (\\"Witches' Dance Floor\\") in Thale and other sites such as the Bruchberg and Braunlage.  Accommodation  The trail cannot be walked in one day, and in any case there are many points of interest en route, including unspoiled areas of nature as well as cultural landscapes and quaint villages. There are several hostels and shelters where walkers may overnight: * Osterode * Buntenbock * Altenau * Torfhaus  Brocken  Drei Annen Hohne * or  Sankt Andreasberg  Braunlage  Elend * K√∂nigsh√ºtte * Thale  Walking badge  There is a walking badge called the Harzer Hexenstieg for the total of 11 check points of the Harzer Wandernadel network of paths that may be found along the path.http://www.zukunft-harz.de/wandernadel/home/spielregeln.php Harzer Wandernadel  References   Walking maps and literature  * Harzer Hexen-Stieg, Offizielle Karte zum thematischen Wanderweg durch den Harz ‚Äì walking map (1 : 30.000), Schmidt-Buch-Verlag, Wernigerode 2007, * Bauer, Hans & Kroo√ü, Stefan, KartoGuide Harzer Hexen-Stieg, Der offizielle F√ºhrer mit Karte zum Wanderweg durch den Harz (inkl.

History Stewart found a job and started creating game shows for Goodson-Todman Productions in 1956. One of the first game shows he created was The Price is Right aired on NBC and was hosted by Bill Cullen. The second game show Stewart created was To Tell the Truth the same year. The third was Password in 1961. In 1964, Stewart left Goodson-Todman and formed his production company Bob Stewart Productions. His first production for his independent company was the game show Eye Guess that aired in 1966 and was co-produced by Filmways and lasted until 1969. It was followed by the game Personality that ran from 1967 to 1969. In 1973, he created the successful Pyramid game show series starting with The $10,000 Pyramid with his son Sande Stewart who joined his father the same year and produced the series and also formed another production company Basada, Inc. on 23 February, which was named after his sons: Barry, Sande, and David Stewart.\\"Business Profiles / New York\\" BASADA INC. businessprofiles.com, Retrieved on 27 August 2012 As years went by, the series changed its name from The $10,000 Pyramid all the way to The $100,000 Pyramid. New Location In 1978, Bob Stewart Productions was relocated to Los Angeles, California, with its first syndicated program at its new location, The Love Experts. Programs already on air in the meantime were still taped in New York, mainly The $20,000 Pyramid and Pass the Buck. In 1982, Stewart revived The $25,000 Pyramid, but to keep the name and the game show confused with Cullen's version, the format was renamed as The New $25,000 Pyramid with Dick Clark as host. The show was taped at CBS Television City in Hollywood, California. The same year, Bob and his son Sande created the unsold game show Twisters. It would be the first game show credited by Bob Stewart & Sande Stewart Productions (which would officially exist starting in 1987). Another game show was Go, that was based on the bonus round of Chain Reaction produced alongside his son, Sande one year later. In 1985, Bob Stewart formed another production company called Bob Stewart Cable, Inc. for game show programs produced for cable. There were only two game shows produced under this banner, which were taped in two Canadian cities and produced for the USA Network. The first was Jackpot!, a revival of Stewart's 1974 series, which was taped in Toronto. The other was The New Chain Reaction, a revival of Stewart's short-lived 1980 series, which was taped in Montreal. By 1987, Bob Stewart was semi-retired, and his son Sande took over operations. In 1990, the company was renamed again as Stewart Television, while the cable production company was likewise renamed Stewart Cable TV, Inc.. A short time later, Sande Stewart formed Stewart Tele Enterprises and produced the revived The $100,000 Pyramid in 1991, which was hosted by John Davidson and was canceled in 1992 after its second season, the same year Bob Stewart fully retired. Sony In 1994, Bob Stewart sold his company to Sony Corporation. Sande, in the meantime, went ahead and created and produced more game shows with his own independent company Sande Stewart Television. A majority of Bob Stewart's game shows Sony owns has been aired on GSN. Two of Bob Stewart's game show formats have been revived into new incarnations. They were Pyramid and was hosted by Donny Osmond in 2002 for syndication and Chain Reaction in 2005 produced by British television producer Michael Davies' production company Embassy Row in association with and distributed by Sony Pictures Television aired on GSN and was hosted by Dylan Lane. Ironically, Embassy Row would be acquired by Sony Pictures on 14 January 2009.Sony Pictures Television Acquires Michael Davies' Embassy Row, reuters.comNellie Andreeva \\"Ad Week\\" Sony TV Acquires Embassy Row adweek.com, Retrieved on 17 July 2013Sony Corporation of America Sony Pictures Television Acquires Michael Davies' Embassy Row sony.com, Retrieved on 17 July 2013 Today, Stewart Television is an active in-name-only unit of Sony Pictures Television.STEWART TELEVISION, INC. businessprofiles.com, Retrieved on 5 March 2015 Employees Recently said was Bob Stewart's son Sande Stewart, who joined the company in 1973. The most prolific announcers for Stewart were Don Pardo and Bob Clayton. Pardo was an announcer on most of the Stewart productions that originated from New York for NBC (examples are Eye Guess, Three on a Match, Winning Streak, and many others). Clayton was an alternative for Pardo, as he was the first announcer for Pyramid, and also announced for Blankety Blanks, Pass the Buck, and Shoot for the Stars. Another longtime employee for Stewart Tele Enterprises was Jeopardy! game show announcer Johnny Gilbert, who would serve his announcement duties on the 1980 incarnation of Chain Reaction, The (New) $25,000 Pyramid, Double Talk, and both 1985 and 1991 incarnations of The $100,000 Pyramid. He was also an announcer at Barry & Enright Productions and Merv Griffin Enterprises. Charlie O'Donnell, Dean Goss, and Bob Hilton were also fill-ins for Pyramid eventually. The above mentions were also employees for Stewart. Former Wheel of Fortune announcer Jack Clark also served his duties on The $10,000 Pyramid and The New $25,000 Pyramid until 1985. He was also an announcer for the short-lived game show/talk show The Love Experts, Eye Guess, The Face Is Familiar and the unsold game show pilot The Riddlers. He had also hosted pilots for Stewart, which failed to sell. Dick Clark was another longtime employee, having hosted all except one Pyramid incarnation from 1973-1988. One of the other longtime employees was a close friend to Bob Stewart; Bill Cullen, who has hosted the syndicated version of The $25,000 Pyramid among other series: Pass the Buck, Blankety Blanks, Winning Streak, Eye Guess, Three on a Match, The Love Experts, and the 1980 version of Chain Reaction. Ann Marie Schmitt was the producer of most of the Bob Stewart series. Another member of the production staff was Erin Perry, who is the daughter of game show host Jim Perry. Francine Bergman and David Michaels were associate producers of most of Bob Stewart's 1980s game shows. Directors included Mike Gargiulo and Bruce Burmester. Library Sony Pictures Entertainment owns almost the entire Bob Stewart Productions library. However, there are exceptions of three Pyramid incarnations which SPE does not own. First, the original 1974-1979 nighttime run series of The $25,000 Pyramid starring Bill Cullen, was originally distributed by Viacom Enterprises and is currently distributed by CBS Television Distribution. Secondly, the short-lived 1981 syndicated prime-time run series of The $50,000 Pyramid with Dick Clark was distributed by CPM Incorporated, a division of Colgate-Palmolive. Currently, there is no status on who owns that incarnation. Finally, the 1991 syndicated series of The $100,000 Pyramid, hosted by John Davidson was distributed by Orbis Communications and produced in association with Carolco Television in its first season, and distributed by Multimedia Entertainment in its second season. This incarnation is held by Universal Television and distributed by NBCUniversal Television Distribution. However, Sony Pictures Television owns the formatting rights. CBS Television Distribution (which is the successor of Viacom Enterprises) also has distribution rights to The Love Experts, hosted by Bill Cullen. Unfortunately, many of the pre-1978 game show master tapes have been destroyed and completely wiped due to network practices. Others have fallen into the public domain and others through the game show trading circuit.

He wrote, \\"It may well be that some will find a modicum of excitement in Love From a Stranger. But the average moviegoer is a pretty 'hep' customer and the chances are he will be so far ahead of the story that its climactic scene will explode with all the thunder of a cap pistol.\\"Pryor, Thomas M. The New York Times, film review, November 28, 1947. Accessed: July 30, 2013. Critic Craig Butler also had problems with the film, mostly the script. He wrote, \\"A moderately entertaining mystery flick (the story of which was better served when it was originally filmed in 1937), Love from a Stranger is an adequate but unexciting way to spend an hour and a half or so. Stranger wants to be a clever thriller, and it starts out well. Unfortunately, about halfway through it becomes rather obvious, and so the necessary suspense is simply lacking.\\"Butler, Craig.

Common names include Texas persimmon, Mexican persimmon and the more ambiguous \\"black persimmon\\". It is known in Spanish as chapote, chapote manzano, or chapote prieto, all of which are derived from the Nahuatl word tzapotl. That word also refers to several other fruit-bearing trees. Description The seeds, leaves, bark, ripe, and unripe fruit of the persimmon. Diospyros texana is a multi-trunked small tree or large shrub with a lifespan of 30 to 50 years. It usually grows to in height, but can reach on good sites. The bark is smooth and light reddish gray and peels away from mature trees to reveal shades of pink, white, and gray on the trunk. Leaves The sclerophyllus leaves are obovate, dark green, long and wide. Apexes are obtuse to emarginate. Upper surfaces are glossy while lower surfaces are covered in fine hairs and lack basilaminar glands. Leaves are attached to petioles. Trees are deciduous in the north of their range and become evergreen further south. Flowers Diospyros texana is dioecious (separate male and female trees) and produces flowers starting in March or April. The flowers are white, urn shaped, and wide. They have five sepals, five petals, 16 stamens, and four styles. Flowers are solitary or form on cymes of two to three. Fruit The fruits of D. texana are black, subglobose berries with a diameter of that ripen in August. Berries contain three to eight light red, triangular seeds around in length. Habitat Texas persimmon can be found at elevations from sea level to . It inhabits the Edwards Plateau the Chihuahuan Desert, the southern third of the Western Gulf coastal grasslands, the Tamaulipan mezquital, and the Tamaulipan matorral. Throughout its range, D. texana favors riparian zones, prairie margins, and rocky slopes. It prefers well-drained, alkaline soils].University of Texas: Diospyros texana Uses The sapwood of Texas persimmon is clear yellow, while the heartwood, found only in very large trees, is black (ebony), like that of the related D. ebenum. The heartwood is hard and dense and takes a high polish. It is used to make engraving blocks, artwork, and tools. The fleshy berries are edible and sweet when ripe and are used in puddings and custards; they are also relished by many species of birds and mammals. However, they are astringent when unripe. They were traditionally used by Native Americans to make a black dye for animal hides and are still used for this purpose in Mexico. The small size, peeling bark, intricate branching, and drought tolerance of D. texana make it useful as an ornamental.

It has chemical formula (NH4)2SiF6 and trigonal crystal structure. This mineral was once classified as part of cryptohalite. Bararite is named after the place where it was first described, Barari, India.Palache, C., Berman, H., and Frondel, C. (1951) Dana‚Äôs System of Mineralogy, Volume II: Halides, Nitrates, Borates, Carbonates, Sulfates, Phosphates, Arsenates, Tungstates, Molybdates, etc. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, 7th edition. It is found at the fumaroles of volcanoes (Vesuvius, Italy), over burning coal seams (Barari, India), and in burning piles of anthracite (Pennsylvania, U.S.). It is a sublimation product that forms with cryptohalite, sal ammoniac, and native sulfur.Anthony, J.W., Bideaux, R.A., Bladh, K.W., and Nichols, M.C. (1997) Handbook of Mineralogy, Volume III: Halides, Hydroxides, Oxides. Mineral Data Publishing, Tucson. *link to bararite *link to cryptohalite History A. Scacchi first discovered cryptohalite in 1873. It appeared in a volcanic sublimate from the Vesuvian eruption of 1850. In 1926, W.A.K. Christie reported his own chemical study. A microscope was used to pick out enough material for analysis. Distilling with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) produced ammonia (NH3). The anions of hexafluorosilicic acid (H2SiF6) precipitated as potassium fluorosilicate (K2SiF6). Barium sulfate (BaSO4) was thrown into the filtrate, and then calcium fluoride (CaF2). Christie found 20.43% (NH4)+ and 78.87% (SiF6)2‚àí.Christie, W.A.K. (1926) An Occurrence of Cryptohalite (Ammonium Fluosilicate). Records of the Geological Survey of India, 59, 233. Bararite is named after Barari, a locality in India. This was where the species was first completely described. Earlier, bararite was recognized as part of mixtures with cryptohalite. However, it did not receive its own name until 1951.Fleischer, M. (1952) \\"New Mineral Names\\". American Mineralogist, 37, 359‚Äì362. The East Indian Coal Company provided the sample that Christie used to evaluate bararite. Bararite has not received a quantitative chemical analysis in its natural form. Christie received far too little for more than qualitative analysis through microchemistry. He utilized F. Emich's methods with capillary tube centrifuges. Structure Bararite is the beta, trigonal (scalenohedral) form of ammonium hexafluorosilicate. Its symmetry is 2/m. The space group is Pm1. The a-axes in the unit cell are 5.784 ¬± 0.005 √Ö (angstroms), and the c-axis is 4.796 ¬± 0.006 √Ö. The unit lattice is primitive.Schlemper, E.O. and Hamilton, W.C. (1966) On the Structure of Trigonal Ammonium Fluorosilicate. Journal of Chemical Physics, 45, 408‚Äì409. *Unit cell diagram based on this articleAnthony et al. (1997) and Palache et al. (1951) use outdated information for the crystal axes. The information in these handbooks is linked ultimately to two articles by Gossner and Krauss from 1934, in Zeitschrift f√ºr Kristallographie. The replacement source, Schlemper and Hamilton (1966), is cited not just by this article but also Boldyreva et al. (2007). (Note: Data for the space group come from synthetic crystals.) Cryptohalite has the cubic (isometric) crystal structure and corresponds to the alpha form. Both minerals have the chemical formula (NH4)2SiF6. The halides of form AmBX6 fall into two groups: hieratite and malladrite. The hieratite group is isometric whereas the malladrite is hexagonal. The (SiF6)2‚àí is octahedral‚Äîone fluorine atom at each vertex. In bararite, the (NH4)+‚Äôs are trigonally coordinated. They all appear at sites of C3v (3m) symmetry. The (NH4)+ has 12 fluorine neighbors, which form four triangles. Three of these triangles are isosceles. These triangles themselves form a triangle‚Äîaround the 3-fold axis containing the nitrogen atom. One triangle is equilateral. Its symmetry axis is the same axis that goes through the nitrogen atom.Oxton, I.A., Knop, O., and Falk, M. (1975) \\"Infrared Spectra of the Ammonium Ion in Crystals\\". II. The Ammonium Ion in Trigonal Environments, with a Consideration of Hydrogen Bonding. Canadian Journal of Chemistry, 53, 3394‚Äì3400. (For structural diagrams, see link to unit cell and downloadable articles in ‚ÄúReferences.‚Äù) The silicon atoms of cryptohalite, Œ±-(NH4)2SiF6 (alpha), have cubic close(st) packing (CCP). A third form (gamma, Œ≥) of (NH4)2SiF6 uses hexagonal close(st) packing (HCP). Bararite, Œ≤-(NH4)2SiF6, utilizes hexagonal primitive (HP) packing. Layers with distorted octahedral gaps separate those with the anions. The (NH4)+ ions appear a little below and above the (SiF6)2‚àí. In all three phases, 12 fluorine atoms neighbor the (NH4)+. Distances range from about 3.0 to 3.2 √Ö. The (NH4)+ has no free rotation. It only librates (oscillates)‚Äîat least when vibrationally excited. As a salt, bararite is an ionic compound. The ions, of course, have ionic bonding. The atoms of polyatomic ions are held together covalently. The orientation of (NH4)+ is sustained by four trifurcated (three-branch) hydrogen bonds. These bonds point toward the triangles containing the 12 fluorine neighbors. Three H bonds are equivalent. The fourth bond, pointing toward the equilateral triangle, has a shorter distance. The intermolecular distances between fluorine atoms are smaller in bararite (3.19 and 3.37 √Ö) than cryptohalite. In cryptohalite, each anion is coordinated to 12 others. Bararite has (2+6)-fold coordination. The two Si-Si distances between layers (4.796 ¬± 0.006 √Ö) do not equal the six within a layer (5.784 ¬± 0.005 √Ö). Bararite is more compressible along the c-axis than the a-axis. Bararite has no known solution or exsolution, but it is always mixed with other substances (cryptohalite, sal ammoniac, and sulfur). Due to thermal motion, atomic behavior of ammonium salts can be very hard to evaluate. The anions, however, are ordered and have no unusual motion from heat. A third form of (NH4)2SiF6 was discovered in 2001 and identified with the 6mm symmetry (hexagonal). In all three arrangements, the (SiF6)2‚àí octahedra come in layers. In the cubic form (cryptohalite), these layers are perpendicular to [111]. In the trigonal (bararite) and hexagonal (gamma, Œ≥) forms, the layers are perpendicular to the c-axis. (Note: Trigonal crystals are part of the hexagonal group. But not all hexagonal crystals are trigonal.) Although bararite was claimed to be metastable at room temperature, it does not appear one polymorph has ever turned into another. Still, bararite is fragile enough that grinding it for spectroscopy will produce a little cryptohalite. Even so, ammonium fluorosilicate assumes a trigonal form at pressures of 0.2 to 0.3 giga-pascals (GPa). The reaction is irreversible. If this phase is not bararite, it is at least very closely related. The hydrogen bonding in (NH4)2SiF6 allows this salt to change phases in ways that normal salts cannot. Interactions between cations and anions are especially important in how ammonium salts change phase. Physical properties Bararite forms tabular crystals. They are flattened, sometimes elongated, on {0001} (perpendicular to c). Christie reported tiny, transparent crystals of bararite that looked like paddlewheels and darts. Each had four barbs at 90¬∞. The crystals reached up to 1 mm long, the barbs up to 0.2 mm wide. They were interpenetration twins, the twin axis perpendicular to the c-axis. Visually, cryptohalite crystals are almost impossible to discern from sal ammoniac (NH4Cl).Barnes, J. and Lapham, D. (1971) Rare Minerals Found in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania Geology, 2, 5, 6‚Äì8. Inclusions of bararite in cryptohalite can be seen only with plane-polarized light.Lapham, D.M., Barnes, J.H., Downey, W.F., Jr., and Finkelman, R.B. (1980) Bararite. Mineralogy associated with burning anthracite deposits of eastern Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania Geological Survey: Mineral Resource Report, 78, 45‚Äì47. Bararite has perfect cleavage on the {0001} plane. The hardness is probably . The anions (as already shown) are bonded much more strongly within layers than between layers. Also, ionic bonds are not the strongest bonds, and halides cannot normally scratch glass plates.Klein, C. and Dutrow, B. (2008) The 23rd Edition of the Manual of Mineral Science. John Wiley & Sons, Hoboken, NJ. Bararite has a measured density of 2.152 g/mL (synthetic)‚Äîbut a calculated density of 2.144 g/mL. It tastes salty, and it dissolves in water. Its luster is vitreous (like glass). Bararite is white to colorless. These properties are similar to halite (NaCl)‚Äîwhich gave the halide group its name. Whereas cryptohalite belongs to the isotropic optical class, bararite is uniaxial negative.To learn what makes a uniaxial crystal, visit Introduction to Uniaxial Minerals. At 1.391 ¬± 0.003, the refractive index through c is smaller than through a (1.406 ¬± 0.001). The c-axis in bararite is shorter than the a-axes (see ‚ÄúStructure‚Äù). Furthermore, only this path lets light hit nothing but the same ion in the same orientation (all the layers have the same structure and orientation). Bararite has about a 6% greater density than cryptohalite. As discussed before, its structure is more packed. This substance can be produced easily from aqueous solution, but only below 5 ¬∞C (41 ¬∞F) will pure bararite form.Gossner, B. (1903) Ammoniumsiliciumfluorid. Zeitschrift f√ºr Kristallographie, 38, 147‚Äì148. Above 13 ¬∞C (55 ¬∞F), almost pure cryptohalite emerges. Bararite sublimes without leaving residue. Geologic occurrence In nature, bararite appears with cryptohalite, sal ammoniac, and native sulfur. It is found over a burning coal seam in Barari, India, and as a sublimation product in Vesuvius, Italy, at fumaroles (opening in or near a volcano where hot sulfurous gases come out).Scacchi, A. (1874) \\"Appendice alle contribuzioni mineralogiche sull‚Äô incendio vesuviano del 1872\\". Rendiconto dell‚ÄôAccademia delle scienze fisiche e matematiche (sezione della Societ√† reale di Napoli), 8, 179‚Äì180. It also is found in the United States, in Pennsylvania. It appears in burning piles of anthracite (highest grade of coal)‚Äîagain as a sublimation product. Christie found translucent arborescent (treelike) crystals, with vitreous luster. He found white, opaque lumps that were a mixture of (NH4)2SiF6 with SiO2. They were irregularly shaped but usually had a mammillary surface (several convex surfaces smoothly rounded). These hold primarily cryptohalite but also some bararite. In Pennsylvania, bararite normally comes as tiny inclusions in cryptohalite crystals. It appears that first, bararite forms through direct sublimation. Afterward, it quickly changes to cryptohalite. In Barari, burning-coal gases go through a dike (igneous intrusion) of mica and peridotite. The sulfur dioxide must attack apatite in the dike, which produces hydrofluoric acid that attacks the abundant silicates. Silicon fluoride is formed. Ammonia also comes from burning coal. From there, ammonium fluorosilicate can form. A slight excess of ammonia could lead to the white lumps of silica and cryptohalite. Bararite and cryptohalite in their pure forms, for the most part, grow out of these nodules. Recrystallization from the rain is probably responsible. Fluorosilicate minerals are thermodynamically unstable in soil.Elrashidi, M.A. and Lindsay, W.L. (1986) Chemical Equilibria of Fluorine in Soils: A Theoretical Development. Soil Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Soil Research, 141, 274‚Äì280. Still, intense heat promotes the formation of (NH4)2SiF6 to some degree‚Äîas seen in some experiments by Rehim. But this compound will break up at 320 to 335 ¬∞C. Both burning coal and volcanoes are important sources of SO2 and SiF4.Mori, T., Sato, M., Shimoike, Y., and Notsu, K. (2002) \\"High SiF4 ratio detected in Satsuma-Iwojima volcano‚Äôs plume by remote FT-IR observation\\". Earth Planets Space, 54, 249‚Äì256. Chemical properties and uses Fluorosilicic acid and its salts are poisonous.Wiberg, E., Wiberg, N., and Holleman, A.F. (2001) Inorganic chemistry. Academic Press, San Diego. Ammonium fluorosilicate, however, is very rare in nature and apparently much easier to synthesize.

These clans live a hunter-gatherer existence to a shamanic belief system. Six months after the events of Wolf Brother, Torak, the young male protagonist, is now living with the Raven Clan. One of the clan members, Oslak, becomes sick and attempts to kill himself and his young nephew, but is stopped by the clan's leader. He is tied up and quarantined. Torak suspects that the sickness has been created by a group of evil mages known as the Soul-Eaters. Leaders from other Clans come to the Raven camp and tell them the sickness has been spreading through the forest. Torak realises that a small creature has been stalking him and trying to kill him, and when Oslak escapes and kills himself, Torak discovers that the creature was responsible. Torak sneaks out of the camp and goes into the forest seeking a cure. The cure, he discovers, can only be obtained by going towards the ocean to the west. Wolf, Torak's companion from the previous novel, has been living with a pack in the High Mountains, but becomes unhappy with his life and he goes off to find Torak. Renn, the female protagonist, has encountered the creature at the Raven Camp and the clan's mage, Sauenn, explains that a it is a Tokoroth: a child who has been stolen from their mother and for about nine months the child is confined to darkness, fed barely anything to forget everything, even the touch of their mother. The Soul-Eaters then traps a demon inside the child. The demon's souls then take control and the Soul-Eaters uses the tokoroth to do their bidding. Renn sneaks out of the camp to find Torak and she and Wolf encounter each other. They then both go looking for him. At the seashore, Torak encounters and fights three boys from the Seal Clan: Bale, Detlan and Asrif, but is eventually overpowered. They believe that, by washing his hunting gear in the sea, he has dishonoured the Sea Mother and must be punished, so they take him by canoe to their home in the Seal Islands. Renn and Wolf meet some members of the Sea Eagle Clan, who take them both to the Seal Islands to help Torak. The Seal Clan's mage, Tenris, initially wants to punish Torak until Torak informs him of the sickness. Tenris tells Torak that a cure can be made from a rare plant which grows at the top of a particular cliff: the plant must be gathered on midsummer night, which is only four days away. Torak quickly realises the Tokoroth has followed him to the island. He goes looking for it but is tricked into falling into a seal net, from which he is rescued by Wolf and Ren. They talk and establish that an orca has been killed, breaking a taboo. Only the teeth have been removed from the carcass. Renn informs Torak that she saw one of the Seal Clan near the orca's carcass, but she is unable to persuade Torak that any of the clan would break such a taboo. Torak goes with Bale, Detlan and Asrif to climb the cliff and gather the plant. Asrif climbs up but his climbing harness becomes snagged, and Torak follows him up. He has to unhook himself from his rope to rescue Deltan and to gather the plant. Unable to reach his harness, he realises that the only way back down is to dive into the sea. Under the water, he feels himself taking the form of a seal for a few moments and senses an angry orca approaching, before returning to his own body. The boys rush into the water to save Torak as an orca attacks Detlan, causing him a crippling injury. When they return to the island, Torak talks with Tenris about the odd experience he had in the water. Tenris explains that Torak must be a Spirit Walker: a human with the rare ability to drift out of his own body and into the body of any other living creature, and become the creature until the souls return to the human's body. Renn is found by some of the Seal Clan and realises that Tenris was responsible for killing the orca, and t and the soul killer. Tenris notices a scab on her hand and lies to Bale that she's sick which gives him an excuse to get Bale to lock her up, therefore Renn can't warn Torak that Tenris is a Soul-Eater. Torak goes to the crag to make the cure with Tenris, but Tenris overpowers Torak with the help of two Tokoroths. Tenris reveals to Torak that he is a Soul-Eater, and that he killed the orca. He reveals that he had created the demon bear which killed Torak's father and realising that the bear's killer must be someone with power, had sent the Tokoroth to poison the juniper berries of the forest, knowing that the sickness will flush the person with power(Torak)out as the Torak searches for a cure. Tenris intends to eat Torak's heart, to assimilate his powers and become the greatest Soul-Eater. Tenris then reveals that Torak's father was his own brother. Wolf appears and chases away the Tokoroth. Renn, who has persuaded Bale that Tenris is a Soul-Eater, shoots Tenris on the hand with an arrow, giving Torak the opportunity to escape by diving off the crag. Tenris jumps after him, but the blood from his arrow-wound attracts an orca which has been seeking revenge for the killing of the young orca. Before Tenris is killed by the orca, he tells Torak that Fin-Kedinn knows more about Torak's father. Torak swims to safety, and he, Renn, and Wolf return to the forest as the Seals warn everyone Off the juniper berries. Fin-Kedinn tells Torak that he met Torak's father and Tenris when he was eleven. He became friends with them, and said that the brothers lived for magecraft. A few years later, Torak's father was named the Wolf mage, but Tenris wasn't named Seal mage. Tenris disappeared with bitterness, but years later he reappeared, joining the Soul-Eaters, who were originally not evil and called the Healers. Then when the great fire broke out, Tenris was badly burnt and the fire scorched lungs and his left hand was burnt so badly that it was ‚Äòshaped like a claw‚Äô. Fin-Kedinn tells Torak that he can either use his spirit walking ability to either make the Soul-Eaters more powerful than they ever dreamed to be and tyrannise the forest, or Torak could destroy them completely. A while later, when Torak is playing around with Wolf, he vows that he will try his best and use his powers to vanquish the Soul-Eaters. Reception Many critics felt Spirit Walker was superior to the previous book in the series, Wolf Brother. An early review from Kirkus Reviews said \\"Paver incorporates vivid descriptions of her characters' woodcraft and other skills, as well as credible views of their oneness with the natural world and animistic beliefs ‚Äì details that enrich her complex tale without impeding its quick pace.\\" Some critics expressed concern that the book might scare younger readers. Translations Spirit Walker has been published in a variety of different languages, including Dutch, French, German, Italian, Norwegian, Korean, Japanese, Polish, and Swedish.

The trail is maintained by The Montana Wilderness Association (CDT Montana). The Triple Crown of Hiking informally refers to the three major U.S. long-distance hiking trails: * Pacific Crest Trail ‚Äì , between Mexico and Canada following the highest portion of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Range and traversing Washington, Oregon, and California. * Appalachian Trail ‚Äì , between Springer Mountain in Georgia and Mount Katahdin in Maine and traversing North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, and New Hampshire.Gailey, Chris (2006). \\"Appalachian Trail FAQs\\" Outdoors.org (accessed September 14, 2006) * Continental Divide Trail ‚Äì , between Mexico and Canada following the Continental Divide along the Rocky Mountains and traversing Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico. The total length of the three trails is about ; vertical gain is more than . A total of 22 states are visited if the three trails are completed. The American Long Distance Hiking Association ‚Äì West (ALDHA‚ÄìWest) is the only organization that recognizes this hiking feat. At the ALDHA‚ÄìWest gathering, held each fall, the Triple Crown honorees are recognized and awarded plaques noting their achievement. As of November 2019, 440 hikers have been designated Triple Crowners by ALDHA-West since 1994.\\"Triple Crown\\", American Long Distance Hiking Association ‚Äì West History The first person to ever achieve The Triple Crown of Hiking was Eric Ryback. Ryback completed the Appalachian Trail in 1969 as a 16-year-old. He completed the Pacific Crest Trail in 1970 and chronicled it in his 1971 book The High Adventure of Eric Ryback: Canada to Mexico on Foot. Ryback completed the Continental Divide Trail in 1972 and chronicled it in his second book, The Ultimate Journey (now out of print). In 2013, Reed Gjonnes, age 13, became the youngest person to thru-hike all three trails to complete the Triple Crown. A thru-hike is defined as completing a long trail in a single trip. She hiked all three trails as continuous northbound hikes in one hiking season each. Along with her father Eric Gjonnes, she hiked The Pacific Crest Trail in 2011, the Appalachian Trail in 2012, and the Continental Divide Trail in 2013. As of 2018, Christian Geiger, age 9, is the youngest person to have hiked all three trails to complete the Triple Crown. Christian, known by his trail name Buddy Backpacker, completed all three trails with his step-father Dion Pagonis. Together they completed the Appalachian Trail in 2013 when Buddy was 5, the Pacific Crest Trail when he was 6 in 2014, and began the Continental Divide Trail in the spring of 2016 and completed it in September 2017 when he was 9. On September 15, 2019, combat veteran Will Robinson, age 38, became the first African American male to complete the Triple Crown. Will thru-hiked the Pacific Crest Trail in 2017, the Appalachian Trail in 2018, and completed the Continental Divide Trail in 2019. Will's trail name is Akuna, from the Swahili phrase Hakuna Matata meaning \\"no worries,\\" and made popular by a song in The Lion King. Elsye Walker, known as chardonnay on the trail, is the first black woman to hike all three trails to complete the Triple Crown. She thru-hiked the Pacific Crest Trail in 2015, the Appalachian Trail in 2016/2018, and in 2017 she thru-hiked the Continental Divide Trail . By the end of 2018, only ten people had completed the Triple Crown within one calendar year. ‚ÄúFlyin‚Äô‚Äù Brian Robinson was the first, and Heather ‚ÄúAnish‚Äù Anderson was the only woman. The three long distance hikes can't be done continuously in one season because of snow, but are generally attempted in sections. Calendar-year Triple Crown The most prestigious accomplishment in long-distance hiking is the completion of the Triple Crown of Hiking in a single calendar year. The first person to hike the Triple Crown in a calendar year was Brian Robinson, who completed the Triple Crown in 2001. The first woman to complete the challenge was Heather Anderson (AKA Anish) in 2018. On December 29, 2018, Tyler \\"The Prodigy\\" Lau, became the first Person of Color and first Asian American to complete the Calendar Year Triple Crown.

The ACMHR's crowning moment came during the pivotal Birmingham Campaign which it coordinated along with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference during the Spring of 1963. Founding Shuttlesworth, the fiery pastor who took over the pulpit of Bethel Baptist Church in 1953, was already a leading figure in the Birmingham movement. He had led an unsuccessful campaign to convince the Birmingham Police Department to hire black officers and accompanied Autherine Lucy and Arthur Shores in the short- lived integration of the University of Alabama. He was membership chairman for the Alabama chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and was the featured speaker in a January 1956 \\"Emancipation Rally\\" sponsored by the NAACP. Later that spring Alabama Attorney General John Patterson successfully headed efforts to ban the NAACP from conducting activities in Alabama. As a result, Shuttlesworth led a group of 11 pastors and laymen who met at A. G. Gaston's Smith & Gaston Funeral Chapel to outline the creation of a group of \\"free and independent Citizens of the United States of America, and of the State of Alabama\\" who would \\"express publicly our determination to press forward persistently for Freedom and Democracy, and the removal from our society any forms of Second Class Citizenship.\\" The group met on June 4, 1956, and drafted a 7-point \\"Declaration of Principles\\": * As free and independent Citizens of the United States of America, and of the State of Alabama, we express publicly our determination to press forward persistently for Freedom and Democracy, and the removal from our society any forms of Second Class Citizenship. * We are not echoing the will or sentiments of Outsiders; but our own convictions and Will to be free, so help us God. We will not become Rabblerousers; but will be sober, firm, peaceful, and resolute, within the Framework of Goodwill. * We Believe in our Courts and in Justice administered by our Courts; but we now point out to the Nation‚Äôs conscience a strange paradox: One State District Court Judge can rule and immediately it is obeyed over the entire State ‚Äî even if questioned or disagreed with; But even a unanimous Decision by 9 Judges of the U. S. Supreme Court (set up by the constitution to be the Highest and Final Court), and Rulings by Federal District Judges, representing the whole United States of America are not only questioned and disagreed with, but Openly Flaunted, Disregarded, and Totally Ignored. * We Believe in State's Rights; but we believe that any first RIGHTS are HUMAN RIGHTS. And the first right of a State is to Protect Human Rights, and to guarantee to each of its Citizens the same Rights and Privileges. * We heartily concur in and endorse the Rulings of the Federal Judiciary that All public Facilities belong to and should be open to All on the same and equal terms; and we Hope, Trust, and Pray that efforts to commence should be begun by Officials in the Spirit of Brotherhood and Goodwill; without the necessity of Lawsuits having to be filed. * We most highly commend the activities of the Officials and Citizens everywhere for the efforts made for Civil Rights, and we thank God for them. But especially do we applaud Negroes in Montgomery, Ala., and Tallahassee, Fla., conducting themselves in the struggle so valiantly, and without rancor, hate, and smear, and above all without violence. * As to Gradualism, we hold that it means to move forward, slowly maybe but surely; not vacillation, procrastination, or evasion. The hastily enacted laws and inflamed statements of Public Officials do not lead us to embrace Gradualism. We want a beginning NOW! We have already waited 100 years!! * We Negroes shall never become enemies of the White People: We are all Americans; But America was born in the struggle for Freedom from Tyranny and Oppression. We shall never bomb any homes or lynch any persons; but we must, because of History and the future, march to Complete Freedom ‚Äî with unbowed heads, praying hearts, and an unyielding determination. And we seek Guidance from our Heavenly Father; and from all men, Goodwill and understanding. The ACMHR was formally created at a mass meeting of 1,000 enthusiastic blacks at Alford's Sardis Baptist Church the following night. Shuttlesworth, acclaimed unanimously as president of the new group, recounted from the pulpit vicious lynchings and gross lapses of justice across the South, concluding that \\"these are dark days\\" before announcing that \\"...hope is not dead. Hope is alive here tonight!\\" A second meeting at Smith's New Pilgrim Baptist Church attracted additional members, including long-time ACMHR corresponding secretary Lola Hendricks. Bus desegregation Initially the ACMHR continued the NAACP's tactics of filing lawsuits challenging enforcement of the city's segregation laws and also modeled itself on the Montgomery Improvement Association in attempting to organize African American citizens for boycotts and peaceful demonstrations. Two small actions preceded the ACMHR's first mass demonstration. Two members applied to take the civil service exam in an attempt to become police officers, but were refused by the city's personnel board. The ACMHR sponsored a lawsuit against the board. On December 22, 1956, Carl and Alexandria Baldwin tested the Birmingham Terminal Station's compliance with an Interstate Commerce Commission ruling banning segregation among interstate passengers. They were arrested and a lawsuit was filed. The first large public action undertaken by the ACMHR was aimed at the city's segregated bus service. After Browder v. Gayle, the decision that ended segregation on Montgomery buses, was upheld on November 13, ACMHR leaders petitioned the city to repeal the ordinances requiring segregated buses in Birmingham. When the city refused, Shuttlesworth organized a display of peaceful civil disobedience in which hundreds of African Americans boarded buses and sat in \\"Whites only\\" seats. On December 25, 1956, the night before the protest, Shuttlesworth's house was bombed, blasting him into the basement where he landed, still on his mattress. The fact that he emerged relatively unscathed left Shuttlesworth convinced that he was ordained to lead and contributed to his attitude of fearlessness. The demonstration went on as planned and resulted in 22 arrests, which in turn triggered ACMHR lawsuits asking for an injunction. In February 1957 the ACMHR signed on as a charter member organization in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Shuttlesworth was named secretary of the SCLC. The next month he and his wife, Ruby, again challenged the segregated waiting rooms at Terminal Station. The couple were able to board their train without incident, but Lamar Weaver, a white man who had greeted them, was met by a violent mob outside the station when he tried to leave. School integration On September 9, 1957, just a week after black students were escorted by police into Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, Shuttlesworth attempted to enroll two of his daughters at J. H. Phillips High School and was met by a mob armed with bats and bicycle chains. Hospitalized but undaughted, he left University Hospital to attend a mass meeting that night, redoubling his message of nonviolence and faith. He pledged to continue the attempts until the schools were successfully integrated and initiated lawsuits against the city's Board of Education. Mass meetings and resistance By 1958 at least 55 \\"movement churches\\" were active in the ACMHR. Weekly mass meetings, filled with emotional testimony, music, and passionate preaching, raised an average of about $200‚Äì300 per week to fund the organization's lawsuits. Additional funds came from speaking engagements in other cities and from local supporters who did not join the group, including whites who were eager for change but could not risk certain retaliation for showing public support for the movement. In its first three years, the group spent over $40,000 of the $53,000 it raised on legal fees, much of it on black attorneys such as Arthur Shores, Orzell Billingsley, Jr, Oscar Adams, and Demetrius Newton of Birmingham and Ernest D. Jackson of Jacksonville, Florida. By 1965 the ACMHR had initiated more federal suits that reached the United States Supreme Court than any other petitioner. As the cases rose through the federal court system, they garnered assistance from the NAACP's legal defense fund. Organized opponents of integration, including the Ku Klux Klan and the National States' Rights Party, threatened and intimidated movement supporters and conducted numerous bombings of churches and residences. Most of those terrorist acts were never prosecuted and their perpetrators acted with impunity, if not complicity, from city officials and police. In addition, white citizens who appeared uncommitted to segregation were terrorized by extremists. In the face of these challenges the ACHMR increased its membership, stirred at meetings by the Movement Choir, founded in July 1960 and directed by Carlton Reese. A group of volunteer guards stood watch at movement churches and pastor's homes and escorted Shuttlesworth and other leaders to appointments. Detectives from the Birmingham Police Department recorded the proceedings at most movement meetings. According to Colonel Stone Johnson, Commissioner Bull Connor would transfer officers from the assignment once they started to \\"get religion\\". Freedom Rides In 1961 the ACMHR helped organize the Alabama leg of that summer's Freedom Rides, sponsored by the Congress for Racial Equality. The demonstrations ended with marked violence as one bus was firebombed in Anniston and another was met by an organized mob at the Birmingham Trailways Station with no police in sight. ACMHR volunteers took injured riders to the hospital and kept them in their homes until rides could be secured to safety. Birmingham Campaign Shuttlesworth and the ACMHR were responsible for inviting Martin Luther King Jr. and Ralph Abernathy to come to Birmingham to lead mass demonstrations in 1963. Though King urged quick action, Shuttlesworth insisted on waiting until the 1963 Birmingham mayoral election was completed to avoid giving candidate Bull Connor any unintentional assistance with voters wary of \\"outside agitators\\". On the day after the election, won by perceived moderate candidate Albert Boutwell, the ACMHR distributed a \\"Birmingham Manifesto\\", outlining the purpose and demands of the campaign. As it happened, even Birmingham's moderate leaders opposed the campaign on the grounds that the incoming administration should be given an opportunity to lead the city through long- needed changes. King's \\"Letter from Birmingham Jail\\" responded directly to local white religious leaders' plea for patience. During the campaign, Shuttlesworth acted as an emotional leader for ACMHR's local membership while King, Abernathy, and others made attempts to bring uncommitted parties into the movement. SCLC's Wyatt Tee Walker planned the practical details of the early part of the campaign, later joined by the campaign defining efforts of James Bevel of SCLC, by Birmingham residents and activists A. D. King, Edward Gardner, and James Orange, and by others. The movement's joint \\"Central Committee\\" met regularly at the A. G. Gaston Motel to coordinate plans and issue statements to the press. As pickets and marches against segregated stores and lunch counters dragged on through the Spring without evident progress, Bevel provided the spark by enlisting young people in the mass demonstrations, finally fulfilling the goal of \\"filling the jails\\" with nonviolent protesters and eventually providing the photographs and news footage of police dogs and firehoses that shocked the world's sensibilities. A truce was announced on May 10, but the bombings continued, escalating to the murderous bombing of 16th Street Baptist Church on September 15. The events in Birmingham made imperative the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Later years Shuttlesworth had moved his family to the relative safety of Cincinnati, Ohio, where he had accepted the pulpit at Revelation Baptist Church in 1961. He traveled between Ohio and Alabama as he continued to lead the Birmingham movement. After the major events in Birmingham, the collegial relationships displayed publicly between Shuttlesworth and the leaders of the SCLC and other national Civil Rights groups began to fracture. Former ACMHR secretary Nelson H. Smith was tapped to head a Birmingham SCLC chapter. Shuttlesworth was left off the podium at the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and was not invited to join the group traveling to Oslo, Norway to accept King's Nobel Prize for Peace. In 1969 Shuttlesworth resigned as president of the ACMHR and was succeeded by Edward Gardner.

Zayanes tribes are known for their attachment to ancestral land and for their tenacity as warriors, especially during the colonization led by Mouha ou Hammou Zayani. Thus they have prevented many invaders from easily seizing Kh√©nifra. Despite the French defeat in the Battle of El Herri, November 13, 1914, the colonizers were determined not to abandon the fight against the Zayanes, but concerned French troops in invading Morocco in coming face to face with the Zayanes. Geography The tribes of Zayanes live in the Middle Atlas mountain range in the area of Kh√©nifra. The Zayanes belong to a large tribe that twice a year wanders toward , where the climate is milder in contrast to Adrar where the winter is very severe. The Zayanes speak Central Atlas Tamazight (Tazayit), which is one of the Berber languages. The Zayanes enjoy goat's and ewe's milk as well as Ahriche. The latter is a dish of tripe, usually consisting of ganglion, caul, lung or heart of an animal wound with intestines on a stick of oak and cooked on hot coals.

While many taiho-jutsu methods originated from the classical Japanese schools of kenjutsu (swordsmanship) and j≈´jutsu (unarmed fighting arts), the goal of the feudal police officers was to capture lawbreakers alive and without injury. Thus, they often used specialized implements and unarmed techniques intended to pacify or disable suspects rather than employing more lethal means. History Japanese law enforcement officers trained in self-defense and arresting techniques primarily based on the unarmed fighting styles of j≈´jutsu. They also developed and perfected the use of a variety of non-lethal implements for capturing and restraining suspects such as juttejutsu (truncheon arts), toritejutsu (restraining arts), and hoj≈çjutsu (binding and tying arts). Feudal era police officers became proficient in a variety of specialized techniques for arresting both armed and unarmed individuals. Many traditional Japanese martial arts schools once included elements of taiho jutsu, although most have since been lost to history. A number of taiho jutsu techniques have survived, though, and are still taught and practiced in their original forms by specialists in j≈´jutsu as well as kenjutsu and iaido (swordsmanship). Modern taiho-jutsu The modern version of taiho-jutsu was created during the Allied occupation of post World War II Japan. Japan was being demilitarized, the practice of the martial arts had been prohibited, and the Japanese police force was unable to cope with the outbreaks of violence during that period. The Tokyo police bureau convened a technical committee headed by kendoist Saimura Goro; judoist Nagaoka Shuichi; Shimizu Takaji, the twenty-fifth headmaster of the Shindo Muso Ryu; Otsuka Hidenori, founder of the Wado Ryu; and Horiguchi Tsuneo, a pistol expert. This committee reviewed the techniques of classical kenjutsu, jujutsu, and jojutsu, and adapted several techniques from each of these disciplines for police use; the committee also selected techniques from modern disciplines, such as jujutsu, karate-jutsu, kendo, and judo, for incorporation into the proposed system of self-defense; and further ideas were gained from a study of Western boxing. A system comprising these elements and called taiho- jutsu was created in 1947, and Taiho-jutsu Kihon Kozo (Fundamentals of Taiho- jutsu) was published as an official manual for policemen. Takaji and Takayama Kenichi demonstrated jodo for the Police Technical Commission in 1927, and this resulted in the subsequent development of a police combat system using the short staff or j≈ç, keijojutsu, which is still used by the Japanese riot police (although the staff used is somewhat heftier than that used in classical jodo). Taiho-jutsu has had several revisions since 1947 and is still studied and examined to bring in refinements and adapt it to new conditions of street fighting. It makes great use of Keibo, a short police baton, in a range of techniques called Keibo-soho, as well as the extending tubular baton (Tokushu Keibo) which was adopted by the Japanese police in 1966. In the United States Taiho-jutsu was introduced to the U.S. when the Strategic Air Command began sending combative measures instructors to the Kodokan in Japan for eight-week training programs. The course was a Japanese-designed mix of judo, karate, aikido and taiho-jutsu. Kodokan officials contacted the JKA to manage the karate instruction. The JKA responded by sending Nishiyama, Obata, Okazaki, and Terada. Judo instruction was provided by Kodokan greats Kotani, Otaki, Takagake, Sato, Shinojima, and Yamaguchi. Aikido instruction was led by Tomiki, along with Yamada and Inuzuka, while the instruction in taiho-jutsu was given by Hosokawa and Kikuchi. The SAC airmen attended class at the dojo for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, and at the end of the course had to compete against and be evaluated by ten black belts. Upon returning to the United States, these airmen became instructors at every SAC base where it was important to develop combatives courses for crewmen in training. One of the current leaders in the United States taiho-jutsu community is Daniel Hect; Daniel has over 30 years experience in combatives and is a police officer and Reserve USAF Security Forces Master Sergeant. To promote more effective arrest and control and defensive tactics training methods, Daniel Hect led a committee of law enforcement and military trainers as well as leading martial artist in reviewing the techniques from traditional taiho-jutsu, Goju karate, Japanese jujutsu, Brazilian jujutsu, and aikido to develop a comprehensive Arrest and Control curriculum that could be used in the field today. To validate the project, Daniel also attended the University of Southern California for his master's degree and completed this summary project on \\"The Impact of Martial Arts in Law Enforcement\\" where the benefits of taiho-jutsu were emphasized. The Shudokan Ryu, Taiho Jutsu committee selected techniques that were effective, easy to use and could be adapted to meet the standards set by the California Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST). These same techniques were incorporated into the Shudokan Ryu, Taiho Jutsu system. All techniques taught in the Shudokan Ryu, Taiho Jutsu system are in compliance with the California POST, Use of Force Standard; and are the foundation for Arrest and Control/Defensive Tactics curricula. Techniques not applicable to current law enforcement methods were omitted from the Shudokan Ryu, Taiho Jutsu curricula to limit the potential of excessive force liability. As military units have different force options and rules of engagement specific to the operation and branch of service, a separate but similar methodology was developed to instruct military members in the art of Shudokan Ryu, Taiho Jutsu. These techniques are taught to military members and units. The police and military curricula have separate focuses and objectives based upon the needs of the entities being instructed. Current Shudokan Ryu, Taiho Jutsu instructors teach arrest and control tactics at police departments and police academies all over California as well as force options at military units all over the world.

As she burns to death, Vernon becomes frozen and does nothing to save her life. Afterwards, Vernon starts to become even more unstable and goes on a violent rampage. He visits the home of the taxi driver who caused the accident, and after being unable to play the piano for the driver's son, he knocks over and kills the young boy. Next, while at a local fair, Vernon is tortured by images of player pianos and bumper cars, and nearly strangles to death a carnival barker. He then becomes more focused on vengeance, and murders one of the doctors who assisted in the surgery, along with his fianc√©e. Finally, after killing another doctor, Vernon retreats to an empty concert hall where his sister and Dr. Harding arrive shortly thereafter. He reveals his latest victim, then begins to manically pound on the piano keys, proving that he will never be able to play the instrument again. He then grabs Dr. Harding and tries to strangle him to death, but is shot and killed by Lt. Syms who arrives at the last minute.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056056/ Cast *Paul Lukather as Dr. Gil Harding *Joan Harvey as Dina Paris * James Stapleton as Vernon Paris * Ted Otis as Dr. Ross Compton *Michael Rye as George Britton *Laurence Haddon as Lt.

He was a World News anchor for CNN (1996‚Äì1999) and a political correspondent for the BBC in Westminster (1999) before founding The Baby Channel, the world's first parenting television network, of which he was CEO until July 2008. From 2007, Hawthorne has focussed on creating niche TV channels for the Internet, including Beauty Zone TV, Book Zone TV and Theatreland TV. Early life Hawthorne was born in Bristol, England on 11 January 1966; and went to school in Cardiff and Oxford before going to the University of Liverpool at the age of seventeen (1983‚Äì1986) and graduating with a BA Combined Honours degree in Politics and Sociology. Whilst at university, he was Deputy Editor of the student newspaper, the Guild & City Gazette and active in student politics. Career Hawthorne's television career started in August 1989 when he joined Thames Television as a researcher on a business and economics show, The City Programme. A year later, he joined the BBC as an Assistant Producer on Business Breakfast and Breakfast News, where he began appearing on camera as a reporter. He moved to Bristol, joining the ITV franchisee HTV West in order to work full-time as a reporter and get more on-screen experience. Here he produced short films on local current affairs and presented HTV News. He created a weekly business programme, Money Week, which he presented. Hawthorne returned to London at the launch of London Tonight for Carlton Television and London Weekend Television in January 1993. There he was a regular face reporting on London news, covering a wide range of topics including IRA terrorism, crime, business and showbiz. In 1993, Hawthorne hired a Michael Jackson lookalike for a report on the singer's alleged stay at London's Priory Clinic. Hawthorne's arrival with the fake Jackson in a limousine outside the clinic caused a stir, with hundreds of fans and TV crews mobbing the scene. In the frenzy, one radio station, LBC, reported extensively live on the \\"arrival\\" of Michael Jackson, only later to have to apologise for the mistake. In 1996, Hawthorne joined CNN as a World News Anchor, initially working from its London bureau before moving to the network's headquarters in Atlanta. His shows ran at 7.00pm, 8.00pm and 10.00pm and included coverage of the death of Princess Diana; the murder of Gianni Versace; the commando raid on the Japanese Embassy in Lima, Peru and the resulting rescue of hostages held by the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA); and a live interview with Italian Premier Romano Prodi. In 1998, US Vice President Al Gore, on a walkabout around the CNN newsroom mistook Hawthorne for one of his Secret Service agents, a fact which caused some hilarity among the assembled journalists and possible consternation for the Secret Service. Hawthorne returned to London to join the BBC as a Political Correspondent. He was a member of the \\"Lobby\\", the select group of journalists attending daily briefings at 10 Downing Street given by then Prime Minister Tony Blair‚Äôs Press Secretary, Alistair Campbell. Hawthorne reported for BBC1's On The Record; Radio 4‚Äôs The Westminster Hour and Today Programme; and he presented Despatch Box on BBC2. Whilst working for the BBC, Hawthorne became disillusioned by the bureaucracy and profligacy of the state broadcaster and remarked to a friend \\"this is no way to run a TV company\\". She challenged him to do something better and that planted the seed for creating his own TV channel. The Baby Channel Hawthorne left the BBC to front World News for CNBC Europe in London, which gave him the time to develop a business plan for a new satellite television channel. In 2000, Rupert Murdoch‚Äôs British Sky Broadcasting announced plans to give away free digital satellite boxes to anyone who wanted one, and Hawthorne recognised digital compression technology allowed for hundreds of new channels to launch on the back of Sky's distribution. Hawthorne looked at the array of niche magazines on the newsstand and zeroed in on parenting as a genre which nobody was doing on TV. The idea for the Baby Channel was born. However, the dotcom bubble burst in 2000-01 and other new niche TV channels like Channel Health and Money Channel went bust very quickly making it difficult to raise the venture capital to finance the Baby Channel. Hawthorne personally financed its launch online in 2002, on HomeChoice (now Tiscali) in June 2004 and on Virgin Media's cable TV platform in September 2005. RDF Media Plc and Simply Media TV Ltd invested in the channel to launch it on the UK (Sky) satellite TV platform on 10 October 2005 with Hawthorne as Chief Executive Officer and a 25% shareholder. The channel's programmes included tips on pregnancy, birth, child health, parenthood, cookery, exercise and family life. In 2006, Hawthorne became CEO of Simply Media's channels and production business, where he launched Simply TV as a satellite entertainment channel. Simply also launched a raft of niche web TV channels including Beauty Zone, Health Zone, Food Zone, Astrozone (for astrology), Avenue 11 (a music and showbiz channel) and Simply Entertainment (movie news). Hawthorne also created Borders TV, a web TV service for the UK book retailer; Boots TV for the pharmacy retailer; and all of the video channels on iVillage UK. Hawthorne sold his stake in both Simply Media and the Baby Channel and resigned in July 2008. Now working through his own small vehicle, Videobite, Hawthorne has launched Waterstone‚Äôs TV for the book retailer and created two channels of his own, Book Zone TV and a theatre channel, Theatreland TV.

The spaniel was a large dog notable for its thick curly coat. One of the most famous specimens of the Alpine Spaniel is Barry, however his preserved body has been modified on more than one occasion to fit with descriptions of the extinct breed from earlier time periods. Due to the conditions in the Alps, and a series of accidents, extinction was discussed as a possibility by authors during the 1830s, and at some point prior to 1847 the entire breed was reduced to a single example due to disease. Evidence held at the Natural History Museum in Bern show that two distinct breeds of dog were being used in the area during this time period. The breed is thought to be the predecessor to the modern St. Bernard and the Clumber Spaniel. Description The Alpine Spaniel was a large breed of spaniel, described as reaching two feet at the withers and six feet from the nose to the tail. It had a closely set coat, curlier than that of the English Cocker Spaniel or the English Springer Spaniel. An intelligent breed, it was particularly adapted to the climate of the Swiss Alps. Old skulls in the collection of the Natural History Museum in Bern demonstrate a diversity in head shapes. The collection proves at least two distinct variations during the same time period. The larger skulls have a greater pronounced stop with a shorter muzzle, while the smaller skulls show a great deal less stop whilst having longer muzzles. History A drawing of the stuffed body of Barry, a dog owned by the Great St Bernard Hospice around 1800 prior to the modifications made in 1923. Alpine Spaniels were kept by the canons of the monasteries in the Alps in order to search for travellers during heavy snow storms, including the Great St. Bernard Hospice in the Great St. Bernard Pass between Italy and Switzerland. The dogs would be dispatched in pairs to search for fallen travellers and were trained so that upon finding them would return to the canons in order to lead rescuers back to the unfortunate individuals. The Alpine breed was also used as a watchdog to guard sheep and cattle of mountainous regions, including the Himalayas. Between 1800 and 1814, a dog named Barry lived as a rescue dog at the hospice, and was famous enough at the time for his body to be preserved at the Natural History Museum of Bern. However, during the preservation, the taxidermist and the director of the Museum agreed to modify the body towards what they thought was a good example of the breed during that period. The head itself was further modified in 1923 to represent the Saint Bernard of that era. Prior to this the skull was a great deal flatter with a moderate stop. In 1829 a Mastiff-like dog was brought from the Great St. Bernard Hospice and was exhibited in London and Liverpool to thousands of people. This publicised the existence of an Alpine Mastiff, but drawings of the dog did not match descriptions of the Alpine Spaniel from before the exhibition and the descriptions of the Spaniel were ridiculed by later publications. Because of the treacherous conditions in which this breed of dog was used, coupled with a succession of accidents, talk of the whole stock becoming extinct was raised as early as 1839. However at some point prior to 1847 a pestilence swept through the region and reduced the number down to a single specimen, which forced the canons into crossing it with other breeds. Legacy Newfoundland St. Bernard The Alpine Spaniel was one of the direct genetic progenitors to the St. Bernard. Starting in 1830, the monks and canons of the Swiss Alps began crossing the dogs with the Newfoundland, expecting that the resulting offspring would have the longer hair of the Newfoundland and this would protect the dogs better from the cold. Unfortunately ice would form on the longer hair, and seeing that the dogs were no longer effective rescue dogs, the monasteries gave them away to people in the surrounding Swiss valleys. In 1855 a stud book was opened for these crosses, which supplied the hospice with suitable dogs and also exported the dogs overseas. Many people began breeding them indiscriminately, which resulted in their modern appearance. By 1868, the breed was commonly being referred to as the \\"Saint Bernard Dog\\" first and the Alpine Spaniel second. Clumber Spaniel It is thought that the Clumber Spaniel originated in 18th century France from the Basset Hound and the Alpine Spaniel. The name \\"Clumber\\" itself comes from Clumber Park, Nottinghamshire.

Her paternal grandparents were Frederick II Eugene, Duke of W√ºrttemberg, and Friederike Dorothea of Brandenburg-Schwedt. Her maternal grandparents were Charles Christian, Prince of Nassau-Weilburg, and Princess Carolina of Orange-Nassau, a daughter of William IV, Prince of Orange. Marriage and children On 15 April 1820 in Stuttgart, Pauline Therese married her first cousin King William I of W√ºrttemberg. Pauline thus became Queen consort of W√ºrttemberg. As his third wife, their marriage was unhappy, particularly because of the deep attachment William showed to his mistress, the actress Amalia Stubenrauch. Nevertheless, they had three children including the future King Charles I. Pauline also served as a stepmother to Marie and Sophie, future Queen Consort of the Netherlands; they were William's daughters from his second marriage to Grand Duchess Catherine Pavlovna of Russia. In a letter written to her friend Lady Malet, Queen Sophie would later write of the possibility of how her stepmother Queen Pauline and one of her daughters (Catherine or Augusta) would soon be taking refuge in the Netherlands, as a consequence of the events following the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states.Sophie of W√ºrttemberg, p. 94. Death William I died at Schloss Rosenstein in Stuttgart on 25 June 1864. Upon his death, their alienation became known to the public; Pauline was completely excluded from her inheritance in his will. She died at Stuttgart, nine years later, on 10 March 1873, having lived her last years in Switzerland. Pauline had been very popular, not only for the kindness she showed to her subjects but also for the devotion she showed to the poor.

K. gracilis has been shown to reduce survival on saplings, but adult trees have been found with more than 30 feeding scars on their roots. But trees that are weakened by air pollution or changes in soil chemistry may invite K. gracilis infestation. Adults can be found in woody areas between June and August. They are cryptically colored, but are active for 20‚Äì40 minutes each dawn and twilight, and occasionally come to light. In the conifer swift moth, courtship, mating, and egg laying occur during evening hours; only oviposition occurs in the morning. They are Exoporia, and females scatter eggs while in flight. It takes two years for the larvae to mature, so populations tend towards two-year cycles. Females emit pheromones to attract males, from organs on their hind wings.

It is a sequel to the 1992 game Epic. It was released digitally in a bundle with Epic on December 20, 2019 by Piko Interactive on GOG.com with support for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux pre-packed with DOSBox. Plot The game is the sequel to the game Epic. It charts the further adventures of that game's main character as he seeks revenge on the evil Raxxons, an alien race who genetically altered him to become one of their own. Gameplay Development Inferno used the game engine from TFX, the game Digital Image Design released the previous year. Inferno was showcased at the 1993 Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada alongside TFX. A version for the Commodore Amiga was trailed in early 1994, alongside TFX, however this version was not released. Similarly, a port for the Atari Jaguar was also reported to be under development but never came to fruition. In 1994, Inferno was shown at the European Computer Trade Show in the Business Design Centre in London, England. Reception A reviewer for Next Generation gave Inferno three out of five stars, commenting that \\"Although [the] controls and equipment are truly inspired ... the gameplay often has a tendency to be a little hard to follow. Those with the patience to stick with it will find a unique gaming experience, but one that never fully achieves greatness.\\" Dragon gave the game 2¬Ω and 3¬Ω out of 5 stars. German gaming magazine Aktueller Software Markt gave Inferno an overall score of 11/12, and named it an ASM Hit. German gaming magazine PC Games gave an overall score of 80%. Finnish gaming magazine MikroBitti gave Inferno an exceptionally high score of 97%, and named the game a Bit Hit. PC Gamer gave an overall score of 73%, and praised Inferno's gameplay due to its 'sense of scale', variety, and fast- paced action. PC Gamer however criticized the game's complex controls, but noted Inferno as a \\"state of the art\\" space opera shoot 'em up, despite having significant competition in the genre. Computer Gaming World gave Inferno one out of five stars, calling its plot \\"generic\\" and \\"cheesy\\", and the game as a whole 'glitchy' and \\"tedious\\". CGW noted a vast difference in graphic quality between the game's cutscenes as compared to the rest of the game, reducing the game's graphics down to \\"flat-shaded polygons in primary colors\\", further stating that Inferno is \\"terribly mediocre\\" and \\"impossible to recommend [to anyone]\\" due to the abundance of other similar, better games. In 1996, CGW ranked it as the 44th worst game of all time, summarizing it as having a \\"Bad storyline, guttural voice acting, and way too many dull cinematics in a limp space shooter.\\" References External links Inferno at GameSpy *Inferno at IGN 1994 video games Cancelled Atari Jaguar games DOS games DOS-only games Ocean Software games Piko Interactive games Space combat simulators Video game sequels Video games developed in the United Kingdom Video games scored by Barry Leitch ","title":"Inferno (video game)"},{"id":"25160648","text":"Xenonola is a monotypic moth genus of the family Nolidae described by Wileman and West in 1928.

The species' range extends from southwest Massachusetts, south to southern Alabama, west to Louisiana and north to Illinois.Ernst CH, Ernst EM. 2003. Snakes of the United States and Canada. Smithsonian Books. Washington and London. (\\"Carphophis amoenus\\", pp. 53‚Äì56.) This species is common in the ecotone between woodlands and wetlands. It may also be found in grasslands adjacent to woodlands.Ernst CH, Barbour RW. (1989) Snakes of Eastern North America. George Mason University Press. Fairfax, Virginia. (\\"Carphophis amoenus\\", pp. 15‚Äì17.) Though this snake can be abundant in parts of its range, it is rarely seen because of its fossorial lifestyle. When not underground, C. a. amoenus resides mostly under rocks, logs and leaf litter, or burrowed within rotting woody debris.  Description  C. amoenus is a small snake. Adults are in total length, with a record length of .Conant, Roger (1975) A Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America, 2nd edition. Houghton Mifflin. Boston. (\\"Carphophis amoenus\\", pp. 174‚Äì175, Plate 25, Map 131.) The 13 rows of dorsal scales are smooth and glossy. It has five upper labials and one postocular scale.Smith, H.M., and E.D. Brodie, Jr. (1982) Reptiles of North America: A Guide to Field Identification. Golden Press. New York. 240 pp. (\\"WORM SNAKE\\", pp. 162‚Äì163.) C. amoenus is unpatterned and can be tan to dark brown in color. It has pinkish ventral pigmentation which extends onto dorsal scale rows one to two. The tail is short in comparison with its body and ends in a spine-like scale. Females are longer than males, but have shorter tails. The head is small, conical and no wider than the neck. The eyes are reduced and black. C. amoenus can be distinguished from the western worm snake (Carphophis vermis), by its less vibrant dorsal and ventral coloration and lack of ventral pigmentation on the third body scale row. Other small, unpatterned brownish snakes which may be confused with C. amoenus, such as earth snakes (genus Virginia) and red-bellied snakes (Storeria occipitomaculata), have keeled dorsal scales and lack the spine-tipped tail.Croshaw DA, Jensen JB, Camp CD, Gibbson W, Elliott MJ (2008) Amphibians and Reptiles of Georgia. University of Georgia Press. Athens, Georgia. (\\"Eastern Worm Snake\\", pp. 328‚Äì329.) The southeastern crowned snake (Tantilla coronata) has 15 midbody scale rows, a dark head, and a dark collar. the worm snake diet is mostly carnivorous feeding on in some areas strictly earthworms and in others opportunist eating slugs and other creatures that they can fit into their mouths. General description and taxonomy There are two subspecies of Carphophis amoenus: Carphophis amoenus amoenus and Carphophis amoenus helenae. Carphophis amoenus amoenus, the eastern worm snake, is found from Rhode Island, southwestern Massachusetts, and southeastern New York south to South Carolina, northern Georgia, and central Alabama. The two subspecies can be distinguished by the internasal and prefrontal scales, which are unfused in C. a. amoenus and fused in C. a. helanae. No gular scales occur between the posterior chin shields. Each maxilla has 9‚Äì12 small teeth. The single hemipenis has a forked sulcus spermaticus and three large basal spines. Juveniles are darker than adults, with the dorsum changing from dark brown to tan, and the venter from dark pink to pale pink as individuals become larger. Geographic range It is found in southern Arizona, southern Connecticut, southwestern Massachusetts, southeastern New York, New Jersey, southeastern Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, eastern West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, northern Georgia and Alabama, and in the Appalachian Mountains of Kentucky and Tennessee.Wright, A.H., and A.A. Wright. 1957. Handbook of Snakes of the United States and Canada. Comstock. Ithaca and London. 1,105 pp. (in two volumes) (\\"WORM SNAKES Genus CARPHOPHIS Gervais\\", pp. 104‚Äì111, Map 12, Figures 21, 33-34.) It is currently protected as threatened in Massachusetts and as a species of special concern in Rhode Island. Ecology The eastern worm snake is a burrower, and is seldom seen.Zim, H.S., and H.M. Smith. 1956. Reptiles and Amphibians: A Guide to Familiar American Species: A Golden Nature Guide. Simon and Schuster. New York. (\\"Worm Snake\\", pp. 83‚Äì84.) The annual activity period of the worm snake varies with latitude and elevation. Some have found them active in every month but February on the coastal plain of South Carolina. Farther north C. amoenus amoenus is active from March‚ÄìApril to October‚ÄìNovember. Few are active above ground in the summer, but a second, lesser period of activity occurs in the fall. To escape overheating or desiccation, it has adopted a fossorial lifestyle and it usually spends most of the year underground or in rotting logs. They are normally found in forests with high leaf litter and canopy cover. They generally remain inactive during extreme temperatures. They burrow by working their small, pointed heads into cracks and crevices. Activity periods begin mainly in the late afternoon and early evenings and rarely last more than 12 hours. C. amoenus amoenus does not move much but has been seen traveling 45m in a 24‚Äëhour period. Males travel much farther than females and their diets consist primarily of earthworms, but may also include other soft-bodied invertebrates, such as insect larvae. Predators include other snakes, thrushes, American robins, barn owls, and opossums. Occasionally, road traffic kills C. amoenus amoenus, and flooding of the lowlands and other natural disasters have been known to affect the population. Some die as a result of human habitat destruction and insecticide poisoning. When handled, C. amoenus may release a foul-smelling musk from their cloaca, defecate, attempt to burrow between the fingers, and probe the hand with the tail spine. However, they are completely harmless to humans and do not attempt to bite.  Reproduction  Courtship and mating probably occur in the spring; the sexes are most often found together between late April and June. Then, the developing eggs can be seen through the translucent venter of the female in late May and June. Oviposition takes place between early June and mid-July, 5 June to 15 July in northern Virginia. Eggs are laid in late June or early July, two to eight per clutch. Clutches are placed in depressions under rocks, in cavities in the rotting wood of logs and stumps, and in old sawdust piles. A female was nearby or with the eggs in 75% of the cases. The eggs are smooth and elongated, long by wide. Often, one end of an egg is wider than the other. Hatching occurs in August or early September. Hatchlings are about in total length. Populations C. a. amoenus may occur in large numbers where the habitat is ideal. C. Ernst and his students collected 108 individuals from beneath rocks and debris in 100 m along a hillside overlooking the Kentucky River in one hour on an April afternoon. It is the most common snake in northern Virginia, and one site had densities over 200/ha. The 1.88:1.00 sex ratio of a juvenile population in South Carolina significantly favored males (64) over females (34), though the ratio of adults caught in northern Virginia was not significantly different from 1:1.

Their first appearance was at an international friendly between Brazil and the United States at Soldier Field in Chicago on September 9, 2007 and are now found at every national team game for both the men and women's teams. The group can be readily identified by their red membership shirts, American flag bandanas, and are most often located behind one of the stadiums goals with their banners. They are frequently accompanied by a drum corp made up of members dressed like popular American icons such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Captain America, Rocky Balboa, and the Pilgrims. Organizational structure National organization The national organization is run out of Lincoln, Nebraska and handles the day-to-day operations of the group. The national organization is in charge of domestic ticket requests and all other matters pertaining to U.S. Soccer for members. It develops the various forms of national merchandise like membership kits, T-shirts, and scarves. It is responsible for connecting supporters from around the country through travel and accommodations deals and producing various forms of media content like scouting reports and a podcast. For the 2010 FIFA World Cup it organized a travel package for members planning on going to South Africa. In 2014 they again organized a travel package for Brazil for over 550 members. In 2015, American Outlaws organized their first trip to the Women's World Cup. The organization is run by Korey Donahoo & Justin Brunken and is supported by several other individuals. Local chapters The group is organized into local chapters that are established in cities. The local chapters handle local viewing parties, building support for the national team at the local level, and are responsible for organizing festivities & supporters in the event their city hosts a game. In order to be sanctioned as an official chapter the following are required: * A minimum of 35 dues-paying members * A base bar where they host viewing parties on a regular basis * Establish local leadership group * Agree to abide by National Code of Conduct and By-Laws When chapters are officially sanctioned they receive a chapter banner. Each chapter develops their own crest that connects American soccer with local landmarks and/or individuals.

It carries New York State Route 299 over the river between the Town of New Paltz on the west side and the Village of New Paltz on the east. The current bridge, the fourth at that location, was built in 2016. It is the only way into the village from that direction. As such, it often carries heavy traffic on weekends between New Paltz and the Shawangunk Ridge. Due to the flood plains on the western side it has been closed in periods of high water on the river. History Two other bridges had been built at the location of the Carmine Liberta Bridge: a wooden covered bridge, erected in 1845, and a iron bridge that had been built in 1891 at a cost of $677. The current bridge was built in 1940 and reconstructed half a century later, in 1990. In 2008 the Ulster County Legislature formally named it for Carmine Liberta, a lifelong resident and Korean War veteran who had been active in local veterans' affairs and served as vice chair of the town Republican committee for 25 years. Prior to its naming, the bridge was formally known as County Bridge No.135. In 2016, with the bridge nearing the end of its useful life, the county demolished the 1940 bridge and replaced it with a new one, a truss of weathering steel with lower arches, no overhead members and a wider deck. On the north side a lighted walkway for pedestrian and bicycle traffic was added, to better connect with bike routes and facilitate the River-to-Ridge Trail, a planned hiking route between the Hudson River and the Shawangunk Ridge. To take advantage of an improved view of the ridge created by the lower bridge and cleared trees necessary for building a temporary replacement bridge during construction, an observation deck was built on the north side of Route 299 just east of the bridge. Following five months of construction at a cost of $2.4 million, the new bridge was formally opened and rededicated at the end of 2016. Ulster County Executive Mike Hein cut the ribbon, along with Carmine Liberta's widow Angie. He praised the project as \\"creating a waterfront in New Paltz for the first time since the 1600s.\\" See also  List of crossings of the Wallkill River  References   Bibliography  * Bridges in Ulster County, New York Truss bridges in the United States Bridges completed in 2016 Bridges over the Wallkill River New Paltz, New York Road bridges in New York (state) Steel bridges in the United States ","title":"Carmine Liberta Bridge"},{"id":"25160771","text":"Berlin Cosmopolitan School (BCS) is a non-profit international school located in Berlin, Germany.

Their significance derives from a landmark 1996 study in 48 patients by Mazzaferro et al which showed that selecting cases for transplantation according to specific strict criteria led to improved overall and disease-free survival at a 4-year time point. These same criteria have since been adopted by the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) in the evaluation of patients for potential transplantation. The threshold Milan criteria are as follows: *one lesion smaller than 5 cm; alternatively, up to 3 lesions, each smaller than 3 cm *no extrahepatic manifestations *no evidence of gross vascular invasion Under current OPTN/ONUS guidelines, patients with cirrhosis and HCC who meet these criteria may be considered for transplantation. Depending on the treatment algorithm, additional factors such as advanced liver disease (as classified by Child-Pugh score) or evidence of portal hypertension may also affect suitability for transplantation.  Controversy and Research  Given the limitations of the original Mazzaferro study, including the small number of patients and limited inclusion criteria, there is ongoing discussion and controversy regarding the appropriate criteria for transplant. Additional studies attempting to replicate outcomes of the Mazzaferro study using Milan criteria thresholds have reported slightly less favorable 5-year survival statistics, ranging from 50% to 70%. Some have advocated for the use of expanded guidelines for liver transplantation in the setting of HCC. In 2003, Yao et al. reported experience at the University of California San Francisco 5-year post-transplantation survival of 75% in patients with tumors as large as 6.5 cm, or up to 3 lesions each less than 4.5 cm with cumulative tumor burden ‚â§8 cm. Additional studies using these so-called \\"UCSF criteria\\" have shown favorable post transplant outcomes, although also higher rates of post transplant recurrence and higher rates of disease progression while waiting for transplant.

His brother was the conductor and composer Jean- Baptiste-Edouard Montaubry (1824‚Äì1883).F√©tis F-J. Biographie universelle des musiciens. Paris, 1878. Life and career At the Paris Conservatoire he at first studied cello and began to play in orchestras, playing in the orchestra of the Th√©√¢tre du Vaudeville while his brother was first violin. Realising that he had attractive voice, he returned to the Conservatoire as a student of Panseron and Moreau-Sainti. After completion of his studies he went to America and was engaged in New Orleans in both Italian and French opera. After two years he returned to Europe and found success as a light tenor in Lille, Brussels, the Hague, Strasbourg and Bordeaux. In 1858 he was offered a 5-year contract at the Op√©ra-Comique for 40,000 francs per year. Montaubry made his debut at the Salle Favart on 16 December 1858 in Les trois Nicolas by Clapisson, playing Nicolas Dalayrac. His success was great (he was praised by Berlioz) and lead to further important roles in the Op√©ra-Comique repertoire: Fra Diavolo, Le songe d'une nuit d'ete, Les mousquetaires de la reine, Zampa, Le postillon de Longjumeau, Le petit chaperon rouge and Rose et Colas. In 1860 he sang in an official cantata 'Vive l'empereur' with music by Jules Cohen. On 2 February 1861 he appeared as Alexis in La circassienne by Auber, and in the same year a revival of Le postillon de Longjumeau (Chapelou).Soubies A, Malherbe C.

In Le joaillier de Saint-James (17 February 1862) he created the role of Bernard, and on 6 June 1863, in a brilliant revival of Zampa Montaubry sang the title role, thus assisting a box-office success. He was also the first B√©n√©dict in Berlioz's B√©atrice et B√©n√©dict, which premiered on 9 August 1862 in Baden-Baden. Eug√®ne Gautier's Le tr√©sor de Pierrot (5 November 1864) saw Montaubry in the principal role, (later going on to sing another Pierrot, in Le tableau parlant at the Th√©√¢tre de la Ga√Æt√©). In Le voyage en Chine (1865), he created Henri de Kernoisan. He created several other roles at the theatre: in Le roman d'Elvire, Lalla-Roukh and Lara. In Le fils du brigadier on 25 February 1867, there appeared evidence of wear in Montaubry's singing of √âmile (a lieutenant), which continued in the title role of Robinson Cruso√©. In 1868 Montaubry left the Op√©ra-Comique and bought a small theatre, the Folies-Marigny, which he directed and where an operetta he had composed was mounted, Horace. He left this theatre, \\"losing money but not finding his voice\\", after having another work performed, Son altesse le printemps, and on 12 June 1870 he appeared back at the Op√©ra-Comique in Le postillon de Longjumeau and Fra Diavolo. On 3 July 1871 he was seen as Juliano in Le domino noir. Later the same year he took over the direction of the Th√©√¢tre des Arts in Rouen. In 1872 he was taken on at the Ga√Æt√© for the revival of Orph√©e aux enfers by Offenbach. Later he sang Narcisse in the 1875 revision of Genevi√®ve de Brabant at the Ga√Æt√©. He married the singer Caroline Pr√©vost in 1850 in the Hague. In 1877 he left Paris for theatre management outside the capital.

Early running career Bacheler grew up in Birmingham, Michigan and grew quickly: he was 6 foot 5 inches in the 10th grade at Birmingham's Seaholm High. Because of his height he played basketball at Seaholm High School, but found in his senior year that he excelled more in cross country and track. At the start of his senior year he tried out for the Cross Country team, much to the surprise of the school's legendary track coach Kermit Ambrose (Seaholm's coach 1952‚Äì1967). His basketball coach thought Bacheler was only running to get in shape for the winter basketball season, but, as Bacheler later confided to Sports Illustrated magazine, he discovered he enjoyed running. After his second X-country meet, he was Seaholm's number one runner. He competed in track for the first time in the spring of his senior year and qualified for the Michigan state championships where he finished third in the mile with a time of 4:28. That was sufficient to earn him an athletic grant-in-aid to attend Miami University. At Miami University in Ohio, Bacheler competed in the Mid-American Conference (the MAC). Following the end of his sophomore year he competed in the U.S. Olympic trials in the summer of 1964, where he finished in eleventh place (out of 13 runners) in the 3,000 meter Steeplechase. As a member of the [then] Redskins team, he earned All-America honors at Miami by finishing seventh in the NCAA Cross Country Championship in fall 1964, and again in spring 1966 by placing second in the steeplechase in the NCAA outdoor Track and Field Championships. He also captured the three-mile run in the Mid- American Conference Track and Field Championships in both 1965 and 1966 and helped lead the Redskins to the All-Ohio and MAC Cross Country Championships in 1965. He broke the school record in the 3-mile run, which had been held by Bob Schul, who won the 5,000 meters at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. The metric 5,000 is only slightly longer than 3 miles. He graduated in 1966 and, in 1981, he was inducted into the Miami Hall of Fame: at that time he was the only Miamian to have participated in two Olympics as an athlete. Bacheler then left Ohio and moved to Gainesville, Florida where he obtained a research assistantship that allowed him to pursue post-graduate studies in entomology at the University of Florida, eventually earning a master's degree (with his thesis, The Biology of a Anthocorid Flower Bug) and, later, a doctorate. The track coach at the University of Florida, Jimmy Carnes, had recently created an administrative entity he called the Florida Track Club, as a means of allowing runners to continue competing even though they were not on the college team. The use of a \\"track club\\" was common practice by college coaches, however there was no formal club organization until 1968, when Coach Carnes asked some of the running community in Gainesville to raise some cash to fund travel for club members. Once a true club was created, Bacheler was inspired to design the club's famous Florida \\"orange\\" logo, to give Florida Track Club members their own identity. That same year, Bacheler trained for a spot on the U.S. track team going to the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, where the high altitude and thinner air would present a challenge to distance runners. 1968 Mexico City Olympics In the lead-up to the 1968 Olympics, Bacheler ran twice a day, seven days per week, averaging 12-to-14 miles per day, largely training on his own in the heat and humidity of central Florida. Prior to the U.S. Trials, he competed in only six outdoor track meets, running a personal best of 4:04.2 in the mile in April. Because the 1968 Summer Olympics were being held at relatively high altitude, and late in the year (late September), the United States adopted an unusual two-part qualifying program for its Track & Field team. Athletes would compete in Los Angeles in late June, and the top finishers would then advance to a high altitude competition to be held at South Lake Tahoe, California in July. Bacheler qualified for the altitude-training squad with a time of 14:00.4 in the 5,000 meters at Los Angeles. At South Lake Tahoe he appeared to be less impacted by the altitude than most; Bacheler said he was accustomed to the difficulty of running in Gainesville in the summer, when it is extremely humid. In the Trials final he surprised by finishing in a virtual tie with Bob Day for first place. At Mexico City, he finished fourth in his qualifying heat and was the only American to qualify for the final. One year later he said he felt so good in the qualifying race that he thought he could place in the top 5 in the finals. As it turned out, five of the first six finishers (all but Ron Clarke of Australia) were from high-altitude countries. Unfortunately, he came down with dysentery on the day of the 5,000 final and was unable to compete. 1972 Munich Olympics Three months prior to the 1972 U.S. Olympic Trials, Bacheler, along with Florida Track Club teammates Frank Shorter and Jeff Galloway, moved to Vail, Colorado to train at altitude. Each of the trio planned to compete in both the 10,000 meters and the Marathon at the Trials, which were to be held at the University of Oregon in Eugene. In the finals of the 10,000, the three FTC runners were running first, second and third, but Bacheler faltered on the final lap and (to the delight of the crowd) he was passed by a Eugene native, Jon Anderson. On the final day of the Trials, the FTC trio again dominated in the marathon. Frank Shorter and Kenny Moore crossed the finish line together in a time of 2:15:57.8. Behind them, Jeff Galloway, having already secured a spot on the team in the 10K, helped to pace Bacheler and magnanimously eased up near the finish line so that it would be clear to the officials that Bacheler had finished third(2:20:29.2), earning an automatic spot on the marathon team with Frank Shorter and Kenny Moore. Although the Munich marathon course was essentially flat, temperatures were just over . The race was run on Sunday, September 10 and started at 3 pm. Shorter won in near Olympic record time of 2:12:19.8, Moore finished fourth (2:15:39.8), and Bacheler who had faded from fifth place in the final miles, crossed the line in ninth place (2:17:38.2). Between Olympic performances Bacheler captured National AAU Championships in cross country and the 10,000 meters in 1969 and the six-mile run in 1970 while running for the Florida Track Club. Of note, Jack ran a 5,000 Meter race on the University of Florida track in 1970, winning in a time of 13:41.4 which remains the track record in Gainesville (as of April 2015).Bacheler holds the track record at Gainesville; Florida Relays, University Men's 5,000 Record, retrieved April 6, 2015. He received his Ph.D. in Entomology 1972, and worked as a post doc in the Entomology Department at North Carolina State University until 1976 when he became an Assistant Professor. In 1972, he became an associate professor. Bacheler continued his association with running by working with the distance runners. In 1979 and 1980 he coached the NCSU women's cross country team to the AIAW National Championships.

Club career Born in Sarand√≠, Marcone was an Arsenal de Sarand√≠ youth graduate. He made his professional debut on 18 October 2008, coming on as a second half substitute in a 3-3 home draw against V√©lez S√°rsfield for the Primera Divisi√≥n championship. Marcone scored his first goal on 17 October 2009, netting the first in a 1-1 home draw against Banfield. He was an important midfield unit in the club's 2012 Clausura winning campaign, being an ever-present figure. Marcone was later linked to La Liga outfit Celta de Vigo and Major League Soccer's Chicago Fire, but both offers were rejected by Arsenal. In 2013, he was also strongly linked to Independiente, but nothing came of it. On 9 January 2015 Marcone joined Getafe CF on loan until June, with a buyout clause. However, the deal was declared void later in the month. Marcone played as a holding midfielder as Lanus reached the final of the Copa Libertadores in 2017. He was linked to a move to La Liga side UD Las Palmas afterwards as well as Club Tijuana in Mexico and Atletico Nacional in Colombia.https://futbol20.com/2017/12/25/jorge-almiron-wants-ivan-marcone-for- atletico-nacional/ In the summer of 2018, Marcone joined Mexican club Cruz Azul.https://www.espndeportes.espn.com/futbol/mexico/nota/_/id/4363174/cruz- azul-hace-oficial-el-arribo-del-argentino-ivan-marcone%3Fplatform%3D On 21 July, Marcone debuted with Cruz Azul against Puebla and played the full 90 minutes in Cruz Azul's first match of the Apertura 2018. He won the Copa MX facing C.F. Monterrey in the final. Cruz Azul ended in 1st place in the regular season with Marcone being a very important player to the team. He took Cruz Azul to their first Liga MX final since 2013, where they had lost against Club America in one of the most dramatic finals of all time. They faced Club America again in the final of the Apertura 2018 and tied 0-0 away and lost 2-0 home, both in the Estadio Azteca. In the final, he lost the ball outside the box and ended up costing Cruz Azul the game. After 6 months in Mexico with Cruz Azul, he signed for Boca Juniors in January 2019, in hopes of getting called up to the Argentina National Football Team for the Conmebol Copa America 2019 tournament. On 5 October 2020, he was loaned to La Liga side Elche CF, with an obligatory buyout clause. International career Marcone was called up to the Argentina national football team squad in March 2017. On 26 March 2019, Marcone debut with senior team in the 1-0 win against Morocco. Personal life Born in Argentina, Marcone is of Italian descent.

The School was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 as Queen Anne Public School and two years later became a Seattle landmark. The old sign \\"West Queen Anne Public School\\" still hangs over the former Galer Street main entrance. Designed in the popular Richardsonian Romanesque style by Warren P. Skillings and James M. Corner, construction on the Queen Anne School began in 1895 and classes opened in the fall of 1896. As the neighborhood grew, several additions were added to the school. Classrooms were added in 1899 and again in 1902; in 1916, an additional 10 classrooms and an auditorium were added on the south end, and the school's main entrance, originally facing Lee Street, was moved to Galer Street. Until its renovation in 1984, the last major addition to the school was the principal's office, added in 1920. Originally the Queen Anne School, in 1908 the school's name was changed to the West Queen Anne Elementary School to avoid confusion with Queen Anne High School. In 1974, after the Boeing Bust and subsequent Seattle recession, Seattle School District staff recommended closing the school due to declining enrollment. A grassroots effort of parents, teachers and local residents worked together to keep the school open and nominated the building for historic status as part of their effort. It was the first Seattle school to receive National Register of Historic Places status. The school remained open through 1981. In 1983, the Seattle School District gave Historic Seattle a 99-year land lease on the school's property, with an option to renew for another 99 years. Historic Seattle transferred the site to the West Queen Anne Association, formed for the condominium conversion, and in 1983-84, the architectural firm of Cardwell/Thomas and Associates renovated and converted the school into 49 condominium units. The school is now home to over 75 residents, has been featured in magazines including Architectural Digest and Metropolitan Home magazines, and has been a stop on Historic Seattle's Queen Anne tour. Historic photos of the school adorn the walls, including a picture of students on the front lawn holding bird houses, students playing \\"What have you in your basket\\" and one of a classroom with this excerpt written on the chalkboard from \\"Hiawatha's Childhood\\" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow: West Queen Anne School's classrooms- to-condominiums conversion was the largest privately financed rehabilitation- and-reuse project of its type in the Northwest and is now a national model for salvaging surplus schools.

Timeline of the initial incident  The incident began when a server used by the Climatic Research Unit was breached in \\"a sophisticated and carefully orchestrated attack\\", and 160 of data were obtained including more than 1,000 emails and 3,000 other documents. The University of East Anglia stated that the server from which the data were taken was not one that could be accessed easily, and that the data could not have been released inadvertently. Norfolk Police later added that the offenders used methods that are common in unlawful internet activity, designed to obstruct later enquiries. The breach was first discovered on 17 November 2009 after the server of the RealClimate website was also hacked and a copy of the stolen data was uploaded there. RealClimate's Gavin Schmidt said that he had information that the files had been obtained through \\"a hack into [CRU's] backup mail server\\". At about the same time, a short comment appeared on Stephen McIntyre's Climate Audit website saying that \\"A miracle has happened.\\" On 19 November, an archive file containing the data was copied to numerous locations across the Internet. An anonymous post from a Saudi Arabian IP address to the climate-sceptic blog The Air Vent described the material as \\"a random selection of correspondence, code, and documents\\", adding that climate science is \\"too important to be kept under wraps\\". That same day, Stephen McIntyre of Climate Audit was forwarded an internal email sent to UEA staff warning that \\"climate change sceptics‚Äù had obtained a \\"large volume of files and emails\\". Charles Rotter, moderator of the climate-sceptic blog Watts Up With That, which had been the first to get a link and download the files, gave a copy to his flatmate Steve Mosher. Mosher received a posting from the hacker complaining that nothing was happening and replied: \\"A lot is happening behind the scenes. It is not being ignored. Much is being coordinated among major players and the media. Thank you very much. You will notice the beginnings of activity on other sites now. Here soon to follow.\\" Shortly afterwards, the emails began to be widely publicised on climate- sceptics blogs. On 20 November, the story emerged in mainstream media. Norfolk police subsequently confirmed that they were \\"investigating criminal offences in relation to a data breach at the University of East Anglia\\" with the assistance of the Metropolitan Police Central e-Crime unit, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), and the National Domestic Extremism Team (NDET). Commenting on the involvement of the NDET, a spokesman said: \\"At present we have two police officers assisting Norfolk with their investigation, and we have also provided computer forensic expertise. While this is not strictly a domestic extremism matter, as a national police unit we had the expertise and resource to assist with this investigation, as well as good background knowledge of climate change issues in relation to criminal investigations.\\" However, the police cautioned that \\"major investigations of this nature are of necessity very detailed and as a consequence can take time to reach a conclusion\\". On 18 July 2012, the Norfolk police finally decided to close its investigation because they did not have a \\"realistic prospect of identifying the offender or offenders and launching criminal proceedings within the time constraints imposed by law\\". They also said that the attack had been carried out \\"remotely via the internet\\", and that there was \\"no evidence to suggest that anyone working at or associated with the University of East Anglia was involved in the crime\\".  Content of the documents  The material comprised more than 1,000 emails, 2,000 documents, as well as commented source code pertaining to climate-change research, covering the period from 1996 to 2009. According to an analysis in The Guardian, the vast majority of the emails were from or to four climatologists: Phil Jones, the head of the CRU; Keith Briffa, a CRU climatologist specialising in tree ring analysis; Tim Osborn, a climate modeller at CRU; and Mike Hulme, director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research. The four were either recipients or originators of all but 66 of the 1,073 emails, with most of the remainder of the emails being sent from mailing lists. A few other emails were sent by, or to, other staff at the CRU. Jones, Briffa, Osborn and Hulme had written high-profile scientific papers on climate change that had been cited in reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Most of the emails concerned technical and mundane aspects of climate research, such as data analysis and details of scientific conferences. The Guardian's analysis of the emails suggests that the hacker had filtered them. Four scientists were targeted and a concordance plot shows that the words \\"data\\", \\"climate\\", \\"paper\\", \\"research\\", \\"temperature\\" and \\"model\\" were predominant. The controversy has focused on a small number of emails with \\"climate sceptic\\" websites picking out particular phrases, such as one in which Kevin Trenberth said, \\"The fact is that we can‚Äôt account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can‚Äôt\\". This was actually part of a discussion on the need for better monitoring of the energy flows involved in short-term climate variability, but was grossly mischaracterised by critics. Many commentators quoted one email in which Phil Jones said that he had used \\"Mike's Nature trick\\" in a 1999 graph for the World Meteorological Organization \\"to hide the decline\\" in proxy temperatures derived from tree-ring analyses when measured temperatures were actually rising. This \\"decline\\" referred to the well-discussed tree-ring divergence problem, but these two phrases were taken out of context by global warming sceptics, including US Senator Jim Inhofe and former Governor of Alaska Sarah Palin, as though they referred to some decline in measured global temperatures, even though they were written when temperatures were at a record high. John Tierney, writing in The New York Times in November 2009, said that the claims by sceptics of \\"hoax\\" or \\"fraud\\" were incorrect, but that the graph on the cover of a report for policy makers and journalists did not show these non-experts where proxy measurements changed to measured temperatures. The final analyses from various subsequent inquiries concluded that in this context \\"trick\\" was normal scientific or mathematical jargon for a neat way of handling data, in this case a statistical method used to bring two or more different kinds of data sets together in a legitimate fashion. The EPA notes that in fact, the evidence shows that the research community was fully aware of these issues and that no one was hiding or concealing them.  Responses  Former Republican House Science Committee chairman Sherwood Boehlert called the attacks a \\"manufactured distraction\\", and Newsweek and The New York Times described the dispute as a \\"highly orchestrated\\" and manufactured controversy. Concerns about the media's role in promoting early allegations while also minimising later coverage exonerating the scientists were raised by journalists and policy experts. Historian Spencer R. Weart of the American Institute of Physics said the incident was unprecedented in the history of science, having \\"never before seen a set of people accuse an entire community of scientists of deliberate deception and other professional malfeasance\\". The United States National Academy of Sciences expressed concern and condemned what they called \\"political assaults on scientists and climate scientists in particular\\". For the original letter, see: In the United Kingdom and United States, there were calls for official inquiries into issues raised by the documents. The British Conservative politician Lord Lawson said: \\"The integrity of the scientific evidence ... has been called into question. And the reputation of British science has been seriously tarnished. A high-level independent inquiry must be set up without delay.\\" Bob Ward of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics said that there had to be a rigorous investigation into the substance of the email messages, once appropriate action has been taken over the hacking, to clear the impression of impropriety given by the selective disclosure and dissemination of the messages. United States Senator Jim Inhofe, who had previously stated that global warming was \\"the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people\\", also planned to demand an inquiry. In a debate in the United States House of Representatives on 2 December 2009, Republicans read out extracts from eight of the emails, and Representative Jim Sensenbrenner said: \\"These e-mails show a pattern of suppression, manipulation and secrecy that was inspired by ideology, condescension and profit\\". In response, the president's science adviser John Holdren said that the science was proper, and the emails only concerned a fraction of the research. Government scientist Jane Lubchenco said that the emails \\"do nothing to undermine the very strong scientific consensus\\" that the Earth is warming, largely due to human actions. Climate change sceptics gained wide publicity in blogs and news media, making allegations that the hacked emails showed evidence that climate scientists manipulated data. A few other commentators such as Roger A. Pielke said that the evidence supported claims that dissenting scientific papers had been suppressed. The Wall Street Journal reported that the emails revealed apparent efforts to ensure that the IPCC included their own views and excluded others, and that the scientists withheld scientific data. An editorial in Nature stated that \\"A fair reading of the e-mails reveals nothing to support the denialists' conspiracy theories.\\" It said that emails showed harassment of researchers, with multiple Freedom of Information requests to the Climatic Research Unit, but release of information had been hampered by national government restrictions on releasing the meteorological data researchers had been using. Nature considered that emails had not shown anything that undermined the scientific case on human-caused global warming or raised any substantive reasons for concern about the researchers' own papers. The Telegraph reported that academics and climate change researchers dismissed the allegations, saying that nothing in the emails proved wrongdoing. Independent reviews by FactCheck and the Associated Press said that the emails did not affect evidence that man-made global warming is a real threat, and said that emails were being misrepresented to support unfounded claims of scientific misconduct. The AP said that the \\"[e]-mails stolen from climate scientists show they stonewalled sceptics and discussed hiding data\\". In this context, John Tierney of The New York Times wrote: \\"these researchers, some of the most prominent climate experts in Britain and America, seem so focused on winning the public-relations war that they exaggerate their certitude ‚Äì and ultimately undermine their own cause\\".Tierney, John. \\"E-Mail Fracas Shows Peril of Trying to Spin Science\\".

Archived copy available at Highbeam.com. Retrieved 9 May 2011, registration required. Death threats against two scientists also are under investigation by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation. Climate scientists in Australia have reported receiving threatening emails including references to where they live and warnings to \\"be careful\\" about how some people might react to their scientific findings. In July 2012, Michael Mann said that the episode had caused him to \\"endure countless verbal attacks upon my professional reputation, my honesty, my integrity, even my life and liberty\\".  University of East Anglia  The University of East Anglia was notified of the security breach on 17 November 2009, but when the story was published in the press on 20 November, they had no statement ready. On 24 November, Trevor Davies, the University of East Anglia pro-vice-chancellor with responsibility for research, rejected calls for Jones' resignation or firing: \\"We see no reason for Professor Jones to resign and, indeed, we would not accept his resignation. He is a valued and important scientist.\\" The university announced that it would conduct an independent review into issues including Freedom of Information requests to the Climatic Research Unit: it would \\"address the issue of data security, an assessment of how we responded to a deluge of Freedom of Information requests, and any other relevant issues which the independent reviewer advises should be addressed\\". The university announced on 1 December that Phil Jones was to stand aside as director of the Unit until the completion of the review. Two days later, the university announced that Sir Muir Russell would chair the inquiry, which would be known as the Independent Climate Change Email Review, and would \\"examine email exchanges to determine whether there is evidence of suppression or manipulation of data\\". The review would also scrutinise the CRU's policies and practices for \\"acquiring, assembling, subjecting to peer review, and disseminating data and research findings\\" and \\"their compliance or otherwise with best scientific practice\\". In addition, the investigation would review CRU's compliance with Freedom of Information Act requests and also \\"make recommendations about the management, governance and security structures for CRU and the security, integrity and release of the data it holds\\". The Independent Climate Change Email Review report was published on 7 July 2010. On 22 March 2010 the university announced the composition of an independent Science Assessment Panel to reassess key CRU papers that have already been peer-reviewed and published in journals. The panel did not seek to evaluate the science itself, but rather whether \\"the conclusions [reached by the CRU] represented an honest and scientifically justified interpretation of the data\\". The university consulted with the Royal Society in establishing the panel. It was chaired by Lord Oxburgh, and its membership consisted of Huw Davies of ETH Zurich, Kerry Emanual of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Lisa Graumlich of the University of Arizona, David Hand of Imperial College London, and Herbert Huppert and Michael Kelly of the University of Cambridge. It started its work in March 2010 and released its report on 14 April 2010. During its inquiry, the panel examined eleven representative CRU publications, selected with advice from the Royal Society, that spanned a period of over 20 years, as well as other CRU research materials. It also spent fifteen person- days at the UEA carrying out interviews with scientists.  Climatologists  Among the scientists whose emails were disclosed, the CRU's researchers said in a statement that the emails had been taken out of context and merely reflected an honest exchange of ideas. Michael Mann, director of Pennsylvania State University's Earth System Science Center, said that sceptics were \\"taking these words totally out of context to make something trivial appear nefarious\\" and called the entire incident a careful, \\"high-level, orchestrated smear campaign to distract the public about the nature of the climate change problem\\". Kevin E. Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research said that he was appalled at the release of the emails but thought that it might backfire against climate sceptics, as the messages would show \\"the integrity of scientists\\". He also said that climate change sceptics had selectively quoted words and phrases out of context and that the timing suggested an attempt to undermine talks at the December 2009 Copenhagen global climate summit. Tom Wigley, a former director of the CRU and now head of the US National Center for Atmospheric Research, condemned the threats that he and other colleagues had received as \\"truly stomach-turning\\", and commented: \\"None of it affects the science one iota. Accusations of data distortion or faking are baseless. I can rebut and explain all of the apparently incriminating e-mails that I have looked at, but it is going to be very time consuming to do so.\\" In relation to the harassment that he and his colleagues were experiencing, he said: \\"This sort of thing has been going on at a much lower level for almost 20 years and there have been other outbursts of this sort of behaviour ‚Äì criticism and abusive emails and things like that in the past. So this is a worse manifestation but it's happened before so it's not that surprising.\\" Other prominent climate scientists, such as Richard Somerville, called the incident a smear campaign. David Reay of the University of Edinburgh said that the CRU \\"is just one of many climate-research institutes that provide the underlying scientific basis for climate policy at national and international levels. The conspiracy theorists may be having a field day, but if they really knew academia they would also know that every published paper and data set is continually put through the wringer by other independent research groups. The information that makes it into the IPCC reports is some of the most rigorously tested and debated in any area of science.\\" Stephen Schneider compared the political attacks on climate scientists to the witch- hunts of McCarthyism. James Hansen said that the controversy has \\"no effect on the science\\" and that while some of the emails reflect poor judgment, the evidence for human-made climate change is overwhelming. One of the IPCC's lead authors, Raymond Pierrehumbert of the University of Chicago, expressed concern at the precedent established by this incident: \\"[T]his is a criminal act of vandalism and of harassment of a group of scientists that are only going about their business doing science. It represents a whole new escalation in the war on climate scientists who are only trying to get at the truth... What next? Deliberate monkeying with data on servers? Insertion of bugs into climate models?\\" Another IPCC lead author, David Karoly of the University of Melbourne, reported receiving hate emails in the wake of the incident and said that he believed that there was \\"an organised campaign to discredit individual climate scientists\\". Andrew Pitman of the University of New South Wales commented: \\"The major problem is that scientists have to be able to communicate their science without fear or favour and there seems to be a well- orchestrated campaign designed to intimidate some scientists.\\" In response to the incident, 1,700 British scientists signed a joint statement circulated by the UK Met Office declaring their \\"utmost confidence in the observational evidence for global warming and the scientific basis for concluding that it is due primarily to human activities\\". Patrick J. Michaels, who was criticised in the emails and who has long faulted evidence pointing to human-driven warming, said: \\"This is not a smoking gun; this is a mushroom cloud\\". He said that some emails showed an effort to block the release of data for independent review and that some messages discussed discrediting him by stating that he knew his research was wrong in his doctoral dissertation, \\"This shows these are people willing to bend rules and go after other people's reputations in very serious ways.\\" Judith Curry wrote that, in her opinion, \\"there are two broader issues raised by these emails that are impeding the public credibility of climate research: lack of transparency in climate data, and 'tribalism' in some segments of the climate research community that is impeding peer review and the assessment process\\". She hoped that the affair would change the approach of scientists to providing their data to the public and their response to criticisms of their work. She had herself learned to be careful about what to put in emails when a \\"disgruntled employee\\" made a freedom of information request. Mann described these comments as \\"somewhat naive\\" considering that in recent years scientists had become much more open with their data. He said that sceptics \\"will always complain about something else, want something more. Eventually, as we see, they've found a way to get access to private communications between scientists.\\" Hans von Storch, who also concurs with the mainstream view on global warming, said that the University of East Anglia (UEA) had \\"violated a fundamental principle of science\\" by refusing to share data with other researchers. \\"They play science as a power game,\\" he said. On 24 November 2009 the university had stated that 95% of the raw station data was accessible via the Global Historical Climatology Network, and had been for several years. They were already working with the Met Office to obtain permissions to release the remaining raw data.  Scientific organisations  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working Group I issued statements that the assessment process, involving hundreds of scientists worldwide, is designed to be transparent and to prevent any individual or small group from manipulating the process. The statement said that the \\"internal consistency from multiple lines of evidence strongly supports the work of the scientific community, including those individuals singled out in these email exchanges\\". The American Meteorological Society stated that the incident did not affect the society's position on climate change. They pointed to the breadth of evidence for human influence on climate, stating: The American Geophysical Union issued a statement that they found \\"it offensive that these emails were obtained by illegal cyber attacks and they are being exploited to distort the scientific debate about the urgent issue of climate change\\". They reaffirmed their 2007 position statement on climate change \\"based on the large body of scientific evidence that Earth's climate is warming and that human activity is a contributing factor. Nothing in the University of East Anglia hacked e-mails represents a significant challenge to that body of scientific evidence.\\" The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) reaffirmed its position on global warming and \\"expressed grave concerns that the illegal release of private emails stolen from the University of East Anglia should not cause policy-makers and the public to become confused about the scientific basis of global climate change. Scientific integrity demands robust, independent peer review, however, and AAAS therefore emphasised that investigations are appropriate whenever significant questions are raised regarding the transparency and rigour of the scientific method, the peer-review process, or the responsibility of individual scientists. The responsible institutions are mounting such investigations.\\" Alan I. Leshner, CEO of the AAAS and executive publisher of the journal Science, said: \\"AAAS takes issues of scientific integrity very seriously. It is fair and appropriate to pursue answers to any allegations of impropriety. It‚Äôs important to remember, though, that the reality of climate change is based on a century of robust and well-validated science.\\"  UK Met Office  On 23 November 2009, a spokesman for the Met Office, the UK's national weather service, which works with the CRU in providing global temperature information, said that there was no need for an inquiry. \\"The bottom line is that temperatures continue to rise and humans are responsible for it. We have every confidence in the science and the various datasets we use. The peer-review process is as robust as it could possibly be.\\" On 5 December 2009, however, the Met Office indicated its intention to re-examine 160 years of temperature data in the light of concerns that public confidence in the science had been damaged by the controversy over the emails. The Met Office would also publish online the temperature records for over 1,000 worldwide weather stations. It remained confident that its analysis would be shown to be correct and that the data would show a temperature rise over the past 150 years. Other responses Rajendra Pachauri, as chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, told the BBC in December 2009 that he considered the affair to be \\"a serious issue\\" and that they \\"will look into it in detail\\". He later clarified that the IPCC would review the incident to identify lessons to be learned and rejected suggestions that the IPCC itself should carry out an investigation. In a series of emails sent through a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) listserv, apparently forwarded outside the group by an unknown person, scientists discussing the \\"Climategate\\" fallout considered launching advertising campaigns, widening their public presence, pushing the NAS to take a more active role in explaining climate science and creating a nonprofit to serve as a voice for the scientific community. A paper by Reiner Grundmann used a limited account of the events to discuss norms of scientific practice in relation to two science ethics approaches, the Mertonian norms as of Robert K. Merton, and Roger Pielke Jr.'s concept of honest brokering in science policy interactions. Sources for the paper were chosen for accessibility, emphasising \\"critical accounts\\".Reiner Grundmann. \\"'Climategate' and The Scientific Ethos\\", published online before print 23 April 2012, doi: 10.1177/0162243911432318.

It is based on a limited number of textual sources (such as Montford 2010; Pearce 2010, blog content, commentary, reports from official inquiries, and a subset of released climate emails). These limitations in the data need to be noted. The paper raises the question of how to assess knowledge production in a highly politicized context. Sources were selected on accessibility criteria with a special emphasis on critical accounts. The aim of the paper is not to adjudicate who was right and who was wrong about the science, but to discuss norms of scientific practice in the light of two theoretical frameworks.\\" Footnote 5 cites \\"Wikipedia entry on 'Climatic Research Unit E-mail Controversy'\\".  Inquiries and reports  Eight committees investigated the allegations and published reports, finding no evidence of fraud or scientific misconduct. The scientific consensus that global warming is occurring as a result of human activity remained unchanged by the end of the investigations. However, the reports urged the scientists to avoid any such allegations in the future, and to regain public confidence following this media storm, with \\"more efforts than ever to make available all their supporting data ‚Äì right down to the computer codes they use ‚Äì to allow their findings to be properly verified\\". Climate scientists and organisations pledged to improve scientific research and collaboration with other researchers by improving data management and opening up access to data, and to honour any freedom of information requests that relate to climate science.  House of Commons Science and Technology Committee  On 22 January 2010, the House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee announced it would conduct an inquiry into the affair, examining the implications of the disclosure for the integrity of scientific research, reviewing the scope of the independent Muir Russell review announced by the UEA, and reviewing the independence of international climate data sets.. See House of Commons' Science and Technology Select Committee announcement and Report on The disclosure of climate data from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia, released 31 March 2010. The committee invited written submissions from interested parties, and published 55 submissions that it had received by 10 February. They included submissions from the University of East Anglia, the Global Warming Policy Foundation, the Institute of Physics, the Royal Society of Chemistry, the Met Office, several other professional bodies, prominent scientists, some climate change sceptics, several MEPs and other interested parties. An oral evidence session was held on 1 March 2010. The Science and Technology Select Committee inquiry reported on 31 March 2010 that it had found that \\"the scientific reputation of Professor Jones and CRU remains intact\\". The emails and claims raised in the controversy did not challenge the scientific consensus that \\"global warming is happening and that it is induced by human activity\\". The MPs had seen no evidence to support claims that Jones had tampered with data or interfered with the peer-review process. The committee criticised a \\"culture of non-disclosure at CRU\\" and a general lack of transparency in climate science where scientific papers had usually not included all the data and code used in reconstructions. It said that \\"even if the data that CRU used were not publicly available‚Äîwhich they mostly are‚Äîor the methods not published‚Äîwhich they have been‚Äîits published results would still be credible: the results from CRU agree with those drawn from other international data sets; in other words, the analyses have been repeated and the conclusions have been verified.\\" The report added that \\"scientists could have saved themselves a lot of trouble by aggressively publishing all their data instead of worrying about how to stonewall their critics.\\" The committee criticised the university for the way that freedom of information requests were handled, and for failing to give adequate support to the scientists to deal with such requests. The committee chairman Phil Willis said that the \\"standard practice\\" in climate science generally of not routinely releasing all raw data and computer codes \\"needs to change and it needs to change quickly\\". Jones had admitted sending \\"awful emails\\"; Willis commented that \\"[Jones] probably wishes that emails were never invented,\\" but \\"apart from that we do believe that Prof. Jones has in many ways been scapegoated as a result of what really was a frustration on his part that people were asking for information purely to undermine his research.\\" In Willis' view this did not excuse any failure to deal properly with FOI Act requests, but the committee accepted that Jones had released all the data that he could. It stated: \\"There is no reason why Professor Jones should not resume his post. He was certainly not co-operative with those seeking to get data, but that was true of all the climate scientists\\". The committee was careful to point out that its report had been written after a single day of oral testimony and would not be as in-depth as other inquiries.  Science Assessment Panel  The report of the independent Science Assessment Panel was published on 14 April 2010 and concluded that the panel had seen \\"no evidence of any deliberate scientific malpractice in any of the work of the Climatic Research Unit.\\" It found that the CRU's work had been \\"carried out with integrity\\" and had used \\"fair and satisfactory\\" methods. The CRU was found to be \\"objective and dispassionate in their view of the data and their results, and there was no hint of tailoring results to a particular agenda.\\" Instead, \\"their sole aim was to establish as robust a record of temperatures in recent centuries as possible.\\" The panel commented that it was \\"very surprising that research in an area that depends so heavily on statistical methods has not been carried out in close collaboration with professional statisticians.\\" It found that although the CRU had not made inappropriate use of statistical methods, some of the methods used may not have been the best for the purpose, though it said that \\"it is not clear, however, that better methods would have produced significantly different results.\\" It suggested that the CRU could have done more to document and archive its work, data and algorithms and stated that the scientists were \\"ill prepared\\" for the amount of public attention generated by their work, commenting that \\"as with many small research groups their internal procedures were rather informal.\\" The media and other scientific organisations were criticised for having \\"sometimes neglected\\" to reflect the uncertainties, doubts and assumptions of the work done by the CRU. The UK Government's policy of charging for access to scientific data was described as \\"inconsistent with policies of open access to data promoted elsewhere.\\" The panel was also stated that \\"Although we deplore the tone of much of the criticism that has been directed at CRU, we believe that this questioning of the methods and data used in dendroclimatology will ultimately have a beneficial effect and improve working practices.\\" It found that some of the criticism had been \\"selective and uncharitable\\" and critics had displayed \\"a lack of awareness\\" of the difficulties of research in this area. Speaking at a press conference to announce the report, the panel's chair, Lord Oxburgh, stated that his team had found \\"absolutely no evidence of any impropriety whatsoever\\" and that \\"whatever was said in the emails, the basic science seems to have been done fairly and properly.\\" He said that many of the criticisms and allegations of scientific misconduct had been made by people \\"who do not like the implications of some of the conclusions\\" reached by the CRU's scientists. He said that the repeated FOI requests made by climate change sceptic Steve McIntyre and others could have amounted to a campaign of harassment, and the issue of how FOI laws should be applied in an academic context remained unresolved. Another panel member, Professor David Hand, commended the CRU for being explicit about the inherent uncertainties in its research data, commenting that \\"there is no evidence of anything underhand ‚Äì the opposite, if anything, they have brought out into the open the uncertainties with what they are dealing with.\\" At the press conference, Hand also commented on the well publicised 1998 paper produced in the United States by scientists led by Michael E. Mann, saying that the hockey stick graph it showed was a genuine effect, but he had an \\"uneasy feeling\\" about the use of \\"inappropriate statistical tools\\" and said that the 1998 study had exaggerated the effect. He commended McIntyre for pointing out this issue. Mann subsequently told The Guardian that the study had been examined and approved in the US National Academies of Science North Report, and described Hand's comment as a \\"rogue opinion\\" not meriting \\"much attention or credence\\". The UEA's vice-chancellor, Edward Acton, welcomed the panel's findings. Describing its report as \\"hugely positive\\", he stated that \\"it is especially important that, despite a deluge of allegations and smears against the CRU, this independent group of utterly reputable scientists have concluded that there was no evidence of any scientific malpractice.\\" He criticised the way that the emails had been misrepresented, saying that \\"UEA has already put on record its deep regret and anger that the theft of emails from the University, and the blatant misrepresentation of their contents as revealed both in this report and the previous one by the Science and Technology Select Committee, damaged the reputation of UK climate science.\\" The UEA issued a statement in which it accepted that \\"things might have been done better.\\" It said that improvements had already been undertaken by the CRU and others in the climate science community and that the University would \\"continue to ensure that these imperatives are maintained.\\" It later emerged that the Science Assessment Panel was not assessing the quality but instead the integrity of the CRU's science. Phil Willis described this a \\"sleight of hand\\" and was not what the Parliamentary Committee he had chaired had been led to believe. There were also questions about the selection of publications examined by the panel. Lord Oxburgh said that Acton had been wrong to tell the Science and Technology Select Committee in March that his inquiry would look into the science itself. \\"I think that was inaccurate,\\" Oxburgh said. \\"This had to be done rapidly. This was their concern. They really wanted something within a month. There was no way our panel could evaluate the science.\\" Pennsylvania State University Pennsylvania State University announced in December 2009 it would review the work of Michael E. Mann, in particular looking at anything that had not already been addressed in the 2006 North Report review by the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences which had investigated Mann's \\"hockey stick graph\\" studies and found some faults with his 1998 methodology but agreed with the results which had been reaffirmed by later studies using different methods. In response, Mann said he would welcome the review. The inquiry committee determined on 3 February 2010 that there was no credible evidence Mann suppressed or falsified data, destroyed emails, information and/or data related to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, or misused privileged or confidential information. The committee did not make a definitive finding on the final point of inquiry ‚Äì \\"whether Dr Mann seriously deviated from accepted practices within the academic community for proposing, conducting, or reporting research or other scholarly activities\\". The committee said that the earlier NAS inquiry had found \\"that Dr Mann‚Äôs science did fall well within the bounds of accepted practice\\", but in light of the newly available information this question of conduct was to be investigated by a second panel of five prominent Penn State scientists from other scientific disciplines. The second Investigatory Committee reported on 4 June 2010 that it had \\"determined that Dr Michael E. Mann did not engage in, nor did he participate in, directly or indirectly, any actions that seriously deviated from accepted practices within the academic community.\\" Regarding his sharing unpublished manuscripts with colleagues on the assumption of implied consent, it considered such sharing to be \\"careless and inappropriate\\" without following the best practice of getting express consent from the authors in advance, though expert opinion on this varied. It said that his success in proposing research and obtaining funding for it, commenting that this \\"clearly places Dr Mann among the most respected scientists in his field. Such success would not have been possible had he not met or exceeded the highest standards of his profession for proposing research.\\" Mann's extensive recognitions within the research community demonstrated that \\"his scientific work, especially the conduct of his research, has from the beginning of his career been judged to be outstanding by a broad spectrum of scientists.\\" It agreed unanimously that \\"there is no substance\\" to the allegations against Mann. Mann said he regretted not objecting to a suggestion from Jones in a 29 May 2008 message that he destroy emails. \\"I wish in retrospect I had told him, 'Hey, you shouldn't even be thinking about this, Mann said in March 2010. \\"I didn't think it was an appropriate request.\\" Mann's response to Jones at the time was that he would pass on the request to another scientist. \\"The important thing is, I didn't delete any emails. And I don't think [Jones] did either.\\"  Independent Climate Change Email Review  First announced in December 2009, a British investigation commissioned by the UEA and chaired by Sir Muir Russell, published its final report in July 2010.The Independent Climate Change Email Review, an independent review funded by the UEA, chaired by Sir Muir Russell The commission cleared the scientists and dismissed allegations that they manipulated their data. The \\"rigour and honesty\\" of the scientists at the Climatic Research Unit were found not to be in doubt. The panel found that they did not subvert the peer review process to censor criticism as alleged, and that the key data needed to reproduce their findings was freely available to any \\"competent\\" researcher. The panel did rebuke the CRU for their reluctance to release computer files, and found that a graph produced in 1999 was \\"misleading,\\" though not deliberately so as necessary caveats had been included in the accompanying text. It found evidence that emails might have been deleted in order to make them unavailable should a subsequent request be made for them, though the panel did not ask anyone at CRU whether they had actually done this.Climategate: No whitewash, but CRU scientists are far from squeaky clean, Fred Pearce, The Guardian 7 July 2010 At the conclusion of the inquiry, Jones was reinstated with the newly created post of Director of Research. United States Environmental Protection Agency report The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had issued an \\"endangerment finding\\" in 2009 in preparation for climate regulations on excessive greenhouse gases. Petitions to reconsider this were raised by the states of Virginia and Texas, conservative activists and business groups including the United States Chamber of Commerce, the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the coal company Peabody Energy, making claims that the CRU emails undermined the science. The EPA examined every email and concluded that there was no merit to the claims in the petitions, which \\"routinely misunderstood the scientific issues\\", reached \\"faulty scientific conclusions\\", \\"resorted to hyperbole\\", and \\"often cherry-pick language that creates the suggestion or appearance of impropriety, without looking deeper into the issues.\\" In a statement issued on 29 July 2010, EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson said the petitions were based \\"on selectively edited, out-of-context data and a manufactured controversy\\" and provided \\"no evidence to undermine our determination. Excess greenhouse gases are a threat to our health and welfare.\\" The EPA issued a detailed report on issues raised by petitioners and responses, together with a fact sheet, and a \\"myths versus facts\\" page stating that \\"Petitioners say that emails disclosed from CRU provide evidence of a conspiracy to manipulate data. The media coverage after the emails were released was based on email statements quoted out of context and on unsubstantiated theories of conspiracy. The CRU emails do not show either that the science is flawed or that the scientific process has been compromised. EPA carefully reviewed the CRU emails and found no indication of improper data manipulation or misrepresentation of results.\\" Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Commerce In May 2010 Senator Jim Inhofe requested the Inspector General of the United States Department of Commerce to conduct an independent review of how the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) had dealt with the emails, and whether the emails showed any wrongdoing. The report, issued on 18 February 2011, cleared the researchers and \\"did not find any evidence that NOAA inappropriately manipulated data or failed to adhere to appropriate peer review procedures\\". It noted that NOAA reviewed its climate change data as standard procedure, not in response to the controversy. One email included a cartoon image showing Inhofe and others marooned on a melting ice floe, NOAA had taken this up as a conduct issue. In response to questions raised, NOAA stated that its scientists had followed legal advice on FOIA requests for information which belonged to the IPCC and was made available by that panel. In two instances funding had been awarded to CRU, NOAA stated that it was reviewing these cases and so far understood that the funds supported climate forecasting workshops in 2002 and 2003 assisting the governments of three countries.  National Science Foundation  The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of the National Science Foundation closed an investigation on 15 August 2011 that exonerated Michael Mann of Pennsylvania State University of charges of scientific misconduct.National Science Foundation Office of Inspector General, Case Number: A09120086 It found no evidence of research misconduct, and confirmed the results of earlier inquiries. The OIG reviewed the findings of the July 2010 Penn State panel, took further evidence from the university and Mann, and interviewed Mann. The OIP findings confirmed the university panel's conclusions which cleared Mann of any wrongdoing, and it stated \\"Lacking any evidence of research misconduct, as defined under the NSF Research Misconduct Regulation, we are closing the investigation with no further action.\\" ICO decisions on Freedom of Information requests In two cases, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) issued decisions on appeals of Freedom of Information (FOI) requests which had been turned down by the university. David Holland, an electrical engineer from Northampton, made a 2008 FOI request for all emails to and from Keith Briffa about the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report; the university's information policy and compliance manager refused the request. On 23 November 2009, after the start of the controversy, he wrote to the Commissioner explaining in detail the relevance of the alleged CRU emails to his case, with specific reference to a May 2008 email in which Phil Jones asked others to delete emails discussing AR4 with Briffa. In January 2010 news reports highlighted that FOI legislation made it an offence to intentionally act to prevent the disclosure of requested information, but the statute of limitations meant that any prosecution had to be raised within 6 months of the alleged offence. This was discussed by the House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee. The ICO decision on Holland's requests published on 7 July 2010 concluded that the emails indicated prima facie evidence of an offence, but as prosecution was time-barred the Commissioner had been unable to investigate the alleged offence. On the issue of the university failing to provide responses within the correct time, no further action was needed as Holland was content not to proceed with his complaint. The Climatic Research Unit developed its gridded CRUTEM data set of land air temperature anomalies from instrumental temperature records held by National Meteorological Organisations around the world, often under formal or informal confidentiality agreements that restricted use of this raw data to academic purposes, and prevented it from being passed onto third parties. Over 95% of the CRU climate data set had been available to the public for several years before July 2009, when the university received numerous FOI requests for raw data or details of the confidentiality agreements from Stephen McIntyre and readers of his Climate Audit blog. Phil Jones of CRU announced that requests were being made to all the National Meteorological Organisations for their agreement to waive confidentiality, with the aim of publishing all the data jointly with the Met Office. McIntyre complained that data denied to him had been sent to Jones's colleague Peter Webster at the Georgia Institute of Technology for work on a joint publication, and FOI requests for this data were made by Jonathan A. Jones of the University of Oxford and Don Keiller of Anglia Ruskin University. Both requests were refused by the UEA by 11 September 2009. FOI request made 24 July 2009, refused by UEA 14 August 2009. FOI request made 14 August 2009, refused by UEA 11 September 2009. Though some National Meteorological Organisations gave full or conditional agreement to waive confidentiality, others failed to respond, and the request was explicitly refused by Trinidad and Tobago and Poland. In discussions with the ICO, the university argued that the data was publicly available from the Met organisations, and the lack of agreement exempted the remaining data. In its decision released on 23 June 2011, the ICO stated that the data was not easily available, and required the university to release the data covered by the FOIA request. On 27 July 2011 CRU announced that the raw instrumental data not already in the public domain had been released and was available for download, with the exception of Poland which was outside the area covered by the FOIA request. The university remained concerned \\"that the forced release of material from a source which has explicitly refused to give permission for release could have some damaging consequences for the UK in international research collaborations.\\" In September 2011 the ICO issued new guidance to universities, taking into account issues raised in relation to the CRU information requests. This describes exceptions and exemptions to protect research, including allowance for internal exchange of views between academics and researchers, leaving formulation of opinions on research free from external scrutiny. It notes the benefits of actively disclosing information when it is in the public interest, and disclosure of personal email information related to public authority business.  Media coverage  The initial story about the hacking originated in the blogosphere, with columnist James Delingpole picking up the term \\"Climategate\\" from an anonymous blogger on Watts Up With That?, a blog created by climate sceptic Anthony Watts. The site was one of three blogs that received links to the leaked documents on 17 November 2009. Delingpole first used the word \\"Climategate\\" in the title of his 20 November article for The Telegraph: \\"Climategate: the final nail in the coffin of 'Anthropogenic Global Warming'?\\" A week later, his co-worker Christopher Booker gave Delingpole credit for coining the term.Allchen 2010, p. 591: \\"James Delingpole, in a blog for England's Telegraph, promptly dubbed it \\"Climategate.\\" See: ; Booker 2009: \\"A week after my colleague James Delingpole, on his Telegraph blog, coined the term 'Climategate' to describe the scandal revealed by the leaked emails from the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit, Google was showing that the word now appears across the internet more than nine million times.\\" See: Booker, Christopher (2009) \\"Climate change: this is the worst scientific scandal of our generation\\".

Although he has been given credit for coining and popularizing the term (Booker 2009; Allchin 2010, etc.) he got the original idea from an anonymous blogger named \\"Bulldust\\" on the Watts Up With That blog. See: Delingpole, James (2009). \\"Climategate: how the 'greatest scientific scandal of our generation' got its name\\".

Event begins at 2:45. Following the release of documents in the blogosphere, unproven allegations and personal attacks against scientists increased and made their way into the traditional media. Physicist Mark Boslough of the University of New Mexico noted that many of the attacks on scientists came from \\"bloggers, editorial writers, Fox News pundits, and radio talk show hosts who have called them liars and vilified them as frauds\\". According to Chris Mooney and Sheril Kirshenbaum in their book Unscientific America (2010), the accusations originated in right-wing media and blogs, \\"especially on outlets like Fox News\\". Journalist Suzanne Goldenberg of The Guardian reported that according to an analysis by Media Matters, \\"Fox had tried to delegitimise the work of climate scientists in its coverage of the hacked emails from the University of East Anglia\\" and had \\"displayed a pattern of trying to skew coverage in favour of the fringe minority which doubts the existence of climate change\\".Mooney & Kirshenbaum p. xi: \\"In the ensuing scandal after the e-mails became public, top climate scientists were accused of withholding information, suppressing dissent, manipulating data, and worse, particularly by right wing media and blogs. The controversy garnered dramatic press attention, especially on outlets like Fox News; and because Climategate occurred just before the critical United Nations climate conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, it knocked the whole event off rhythm in the media sphere.\\" See: Mooney, Chris; Kirshenbaum, Sheril (2010) Unscientific America: How Scientific Illiteracy Threatens Our Future. Basic Books. ; Boslough 2010: \\"As evidence for human-caused climate change has mounted, global warming denialists have responded by blaming the messengers. Climate researchers have endured abuse by bloggers, editorial writers, Fox News pundits, and radio talk show hosts who have called them liars and vilified them as frauds. The attacks had become increasingly vile as the past decade, the hottest in human history, came to an end. Angry activists have called for firings and criminal investigations, and some prominent scientists have received physical threats.\\" Boslough, Mark (2010). \\"Mann bites dog: why 'climategate' was newsworthy\\". Skeptical Inquirer.

Media Matters said the bureau chief's response to the report exhibited a pattern of bias by Fox News in its coverage of climate change. It also noted the timing of the directive. The email went out on 8 December last year, when the leaders of nearly 200 countries met in Copenhagen to try to reach a deal on climate change...In addition to the email, it said Fox had tried to delegitimise the work of climate scientists in its coverage of the hacked emails from the University of East Anglia. The network had displayed a pattern of trying to skew coverage in favour of the fringe minority which doubts the existence of climate change, Media Matters said.\\" See Goldenberg, Suzanne. (15 December 2010). \\"Fox News chief enforced climate change scepticism ‚Äì leaked email\\". guardian.co.uk.

(2010) Fox News Reporting: Global Warming...or a lot of Hot Air? Fox News. The intense media coverage of the documents stolen from climate researchers at the University of East Anglia created public confusion about the scientific consensus on climate change, leading several publications to comment on the propagation of the controversy in the media in the wake of a series of investigations that cleared the scientists of any wrongdoing. In an editorial, The New York Times described the coverage as a \\"manufactured controversy\\" and expressed hope that the investigations clearing the scientists \\"will receive as much circulation as the original, diversionary controversies\\". Writing for Newsweek, journalist Sharon Begley called the controversy a \\"highly orchestrated, manufactured scandal\\", noting that the public was unlikely to change their mind. Regardless of the reports exonerating the scientists, Begley noted that \\"one of the strongest, most-repeated findings in the psychology of belief is that once people have been told X, especially if X is shocking, if they are later told, 'No, we were wrong about X,' most people still believe X.\\" Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, vice-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and science historian Naomi Oreskes said that the \\"attacks on climate science that were made ahead of the Copenhagen climate change summit were 'organised' to undermine efforts to tackle global warming and mirror the earlier tactics of the tobacco industry\\".Carrington, Damian (28 October 2010). \\"IPCC vice-chair: Attacks on climate science echo tobacco industry tactics\\". guardian.co.uk. Retrieved 27 July 2011. Noting the media circus that occurred when the story first broke, Oreskes and Erik Conway writing about climate change denial, said that following the investigations \\"the vindication of the climate scientists has received very little coverage at all. Vindication is not as sexy as accusation, and many people are still suspicious. After all, some of those emails, taken out of context, sounded damning. But what they show is that climate scientists are frustrated, because for two decades they have been under attack.\\"Conway, Erik.

Bill Royce, head of the European practice on energy, environment and climate change at the United States communications firm Burson-Marsteller, also described the incident as an organised effort to discredit climate science. He said that it was not a single scandal, but \\"a sustained and coordinated campaign\\" aimed at undermining the credibility of the science. Disproportionate reporting of the original story, \\"widely amplified by climate deniers\\", meant that the reports that cleared the scientists received far less coverage than the original allegations, he said.H√§ne, Justin; Etienne Strebel (19 July 2010). \\"Climate scientists still trying to restore trust\\". swissinfo.ch. Journalist Curtis Brainard of the Columbia Journalism Review criticised newspapers and magazines for failing to give prominent coverage to the findings of the review panels and said that \\"readers need to understand that while there is plenty of room to improve the research and communications process, its fundamental tenets remain as solid as ever\\". CNN media critic Howard Kurtz expressed similar sentiments. Public opinion and political fallout Jon Krosnick, professor of communication, political science and psychology at Stanford University, said that scientists were overreacting. Referring to his own poll results of the American public, he said: \\"It's another funny instance of scientists ignoring science.\\" Krosnick found that \\"Very few professions enjoy the level of confidence from the public that scientists do, and those numbers haven't changed much in a decade. We don't see a lot of evidence that the general public in the United States is picking up on the (University of East Anglia) emails.

The Christian Science Monitor, in an article titled \\"Climate scientists exonerated in 'climategate' but public trust damaged\\", stated: \\"While public opinion had steadily moved away from belief in man-made global warming before the leaked CRU emails, that trend has only accelerated.\\" Paul Krugman, columnist for The New York Times, argued that this, along with all other incidents that called into question the scientific consensus on climate change, was \\"a fraud concocted by opponents of climate action, then bought into by many in the news media\\". But UK journalist Fred Pearce called the slow response of climate scientists \\"a case study in how not to respond to a crisis\\" and \\"a public relations disaster\\".Climategate: Anatomy of A Public Relations Disaster by Fred Pearce, Environment 360 at Yale University, 10 December 2009.

An editorial in Nature said that many in the media \\"were led by the nose, by those with a clear agenda, to a sizzling scandal that steadily defused as the true facts and context were made clear\\".  Further release, 2011  On 22 November 2011, a second set of approximately 5,000 emails, apparently hacked from University of East Anglia servers at the same time as those in the 2009 release, was posted on a Russian server, with links distributed to the message boards on several climate-sceptic websites. A message accompanying the emails quoted selective passages from them, highlighting many of the same issues raised following the original incident. Juliette Jowit and Leo Hickman of The Guardian said that the new release was \\"an apparent attempt to undermine public support for international action to tackle climate change\\" with the start of the 2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference scheduled in Durban, South Africa, a week later. Nature described the further release as a \\"poor sequel\\" and claimed that \\"it is hard for anyone except the most committed conspiracy theorist to see much of interest in the content of the released e-mails, even taken out of context\\".

Florida, 399 U.S. 78 (1970), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the Fifth Amendment does not entitle a defendant in a criminal trial to refuse to provide details of his alibi witnesses to the prosecution, and that the Sixth Amendment does not require a jury to have 12 members..  Background  Williams had been convicted of robbery in Florida and sentenced to life imprisonment. Williams's defense had been alibi, and Florida law required him to notify the prosecution, in advance of the trial, of the names of his alibi witnesses, so that the prosecution could try to obtain rebuttal evidence. Williams argued that the requirement to assist the prosecution in this way violated his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself. Also, in 1967 Florida had reduced the number of jurors in all non- capital cases from 12 to 6, and so Williams had been convicted by a jury of six. Williams argued that the Sixth Amendment not only guaranteed the right to a jury trial, but also required that a jury must have all the characteristics it had under the common law, including that it consist of 12 persons. The Florida District Court of Appeal ruled against Williams on both issues. The Florida Supreme Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the case, and in 1969 the US Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.  Opinion of the Court  The Court held that Florida's notice-of-alibi rule did not violate the Fifth Amendment. The Fifth Amendment would not be violated if, after the alibi witness had given evidence, the court granted a continuance to allow the prosecution to seek rebuttal evidence (this point was conceded by Williams's lawyers). Consequently, all the notice-of-alibi law did was allow the prosecution to do so before the trial, instead of having to interrupt the trial. It did not provide the prosecution with more information to use against a defendant than they would eventually get in any event. The Court also held that the Sixth Amendment did not require a particular number of jurors. The point of a jury trial was to prevent oppression by the government: > Providing an accused with the right to be tried by a jury of his peers gave > him an inestimable safeguard against the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor > and against the compliant, biased, or eccentric judge.Williams, 399 U.S. at > 100, quoting . This function of a jury could be performed just as well by six jurors as by twelve: > [T]he essential feature of a jury obviously lies in the interposition > between the accused and his accuser of the common sense judgment of a group > of laymen... The performance of this role is not a function of the > particular number of the body that makes up the jury.Williams, 399 U.S. at > 100.  Subsequent developments  In Ballew v. Georgia, the Supreme Court held that a jury of 5 was unconstitutional..

Some have identified him as possibly being the messiah of Gabriel's Revelation, but this is disputed. He is mentioned by JosephusFlavius Josephus, Jewish War 2.57-59 and Jewish Antiquities 17.273-277 and Tacitus.  History  According to Josephus: :\\"There was also Simon, who had been a slave of king Herod, but in other respects a comely person, of a tall and robust body; he was one that was much superior to others of his order, and had had great things committed to his care. This man was elevated at the disorderly state of things, and was so bold as to put a diadem on his head, while a certain number of the people stood by him, and by them he was declared to be a king, and he thought himself more worthy of that dignity than any one else.\\" :\\"He burnt down the royal palace at Jericho, and plundered what was left in it. He also set fire to many other of the king's houses in several places of the country, utterly destroyed them, and permitted those that were with him to take what was left in them for a prey. He would have done greater things, but care was taken to repress him immediately. [The commander of Herod's infantry] Gratus joined himself to some Roman soldiers, took the forces he had with him, and met Simon. And after a great and a long fight, no small part of those that had come from Peraea (a disordered body of men, fighting rather in a bold than in a skillful manner) were destroyed. Although Simon had saved himself by flying away through a certain valley, Gratus overtook him, and cut off his head.\\" Messiah claim A tablet, known as the Gabriel's Revelation or the Jeselsohn Stone, was likely found near the Dead Sea some time around the year 2000. It has been associated with the same community which created the Dead Sea scrolls, but does not mention Simon. Israel Knohl formerly read the inscription as a command from the angel Gabriel \\"to rise from the dead within three days\\". He took this command to be directed at a 1st-century Jewish rebel called Simon, who was killed by the Romans in 4 BC. Knohl believed that the finding \\"calls for a complete reassessment of all previous scholarship on the subject of messianism, Jewish and Christian alike\\". In 2009 the National Geographic Channel aired The First Jesus? which addressed the claims and controversy.\\"THE FIRST JESUS FACTS\\" channel.nationalgeographic.com Knohl has eventually abandoned this reading, in favor of Ronald Hendel's reading (followed by Qimron & Yuditsky): \\"By three days the sign\\".Israel Knohl, \\"The Apocalyptic and Messianic Dimensions of the Gabriel Revelation in Their Historical Context\\", in Matthias Henze (ed.), Hazon Gabriel: New Readings of the Gabriel Revelation (Early Judaism and Its Literature 29), Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 2011. He still maintains the historical background of the inscription to be as mentioned above. He now views Simon's death, according to the inscription, as \\"an essential part of the redemptive process. The blood of the slain messiah paves the way for the final salvation\\". According to Livius.org, \\"Simon of Peraea may have 'put a diadem on his head', and his men must have created sufficient trouble to make the Romans send in the legions, but there are no indications that he was considered the Messiah.\\" See also *Jewish Messiah claimants References 4 BC deaths Jewish Messiah claimants Jewish rebels Roman-era Jews 1st-century BCE Jews Year of birth missing ","title":"Simon of Peraea"},{"id":"25161147","text":"Arthur's Pass, previously called Camping Flat then Bealey Flats, and for some time officially Arthurs Pass, is a township in the Southern Alps of the South Island of New Zealand, located in the Selwyn district. It is a popular base for exploring Arthur's Pass National Park. Arthur's Pass township is about south of the mountain pass with the same name. Its elevation is above sea level surrounded by beech forest. The Bealey River runs through the township. The town is located from Christchurch a 2-hour drive on State Highway 73. Naming and history The township and the pass take their names after Arthur Dudley Dobson (1841‚Äì1934, Sir Arthur from 1931). The Chief Surveyor of Canterbury Province, Thomas Cass, had tasked Arthur Dobson to find out if there was an available pass out of the Waimakariri watershed into valleys running to the West Coast. In 1864 Arthur's brother Edward Henry Dobson joined him and accompanied him over the watershed into the valley of the Otira River. A West Coast MƒÅori chief, Tarapuhi, told Arthur of a pass that MƒÅori hunting- parties occasionally used. When Arthur returned to Christchurch, he sketched the country he had traversed and included it in a report to Cass. Arthur Dobson did not name the pass, which he found very steep on the western side. Dobson gave the name \\"Camping Flat\\" to the site that became the township. When the West Coast gold rush began in 1864, a committee of businessmen offered a ¬£200 prize for anyone who would find a better or more suitable pass from Canterbury over the Southern Alps to West Canterbury (the West Coast). At the same time George Dobson, (another brother), was sent to examine every available pass between the watershed of the Taramakau, Waimakariri, and the Hurunui. After examining passes at the head of every valley he reported that \\"Arthur's\\" pass was by far the most suitable for the direct crossing. The township, at the time named Bealey Flats after the second Superintendent of Canterbury, Samuel Bealey, was originally built as a construction village for the building of the Otira Tunnel, which started on 14 January 1908.http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi- bin/paperspast?a=d&d;=TC19080115.2.10 Colonist, Volume L, Issue 12140, 15 January 1908, Page 2; accessed 1 January 2010 The railway from Christchurch reached Arthur's Pass township in 1914, the Westland section having advanced to Otira. Construction of the tunnel was very slow; it finally finished in 1923, and its opening marked by the British and Intercolonial Exhibition. The TranzAlpine passenger rail service passes through Arthur's Pass and the Otira Tunnel as part of its journey from Christchurch to Greymouth. The trip is considered one of the world's great train journeys due to its scenery and views. A power station was built below the Devil's Punchbowl Falls to provide electricity for the tunnel construction and for the village itself. In 1929 the Arthur's Pass National Park was established, New Zealand's third national park.http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/timeline&new;_date=12/3 Article on Arthur's Pass on NZ History website; accessed 1 January 2010 The Geographic Board had a policy of omitting apostrophes in place names, and the name was officially changed to \\"Arthurs Pass\\". This caused an upset with the local population, and the Minister of Lands reinstated the old version with the apostrophe. On 16 September 1975 the New Zealand Post Office also adopted the spelling with the apostrophe. Climate Arthur's Pass Village lies in a valley about 750 metres above sea level and is about 4 km south of Arthur's Pass (920 m). Arthur's Pass Village falls under the K√∂ppen-Geiger climate classification of Cfb (Oceanic). Being situated at a relatively high altitude surrounded by peaks well over 1500 m, this contributes to chilly winter mornings, sometimes reaching below ‚àí10¬∞C. This geographical position allows warmer air to pool in the valley during the summer. Summer days often reach a pleasant 20¬∞C, reaching 25¬∞C once every few years. On average, February is the warmest month with an average of 13.4¬∞C, and July is the coldest with an average of 3¬∞C. Snowfall is fairly common throughout winter, especially in the mountains above the village. Facilities and attractions The township has a DOC ranger station, which also accommodates a visitor information and an informative display room. Visitor accommodation is provided, from camp ground up to hotel standard. The township provides a general store, a petrol station, tea rooms and restaurants. Arthurs Pass is well known as a starting point for many excellent tramping tracks within the Arthurs Pass National Park. There are also several good walks from here, including the Devil's Punchbowl Falls,Short walking tracks in Arthur's Pass, Department of Conservation. Bealey ValleyHalf-day walks in Arthur's Pass, Department of Conservation. and Avalanche Peak.Day walks in Arthur's Pass, Department of Conservation. The mischievous kea (New Zealand mountain parrot) can be found here. The club skifield Temple Basin is nearby and is a popular attraction through winter. The town can be reached by The Tranz Alpine Express train on the famous Midland Line. State Highway 73 also passes through the town.

It originated in the late 1970s from African- Americans in the Jackson, Mississippi, area of the United States.http://www.sonicboomofthesouth.com/prancing-j-settes/ This dance style is characterized by a lead and follow format where one dancer initiates a series of high-energy dance moves, and the other dancers join in the movement. J-Setting features specific dance steps based on Prancing J-Settes marching techniques including the \\"J-Sette Walk,\\" the \\"Salt and Pepper,\\" the \\"Strut,\\" and the \\"Tip Toe\\". In particular, the \\"Salt and Pepper\\" is a type of prance step for which the Prancing J-Settes are named and known. It is a high-knee lift or \\"high step\\" style of marching. Alternating legs lift with a bent knee to bring the foot up to the height of the opposite knee before returning the foot to the ground.http://www.sonicboomofthesouth.com/prancing-j-settes/ The JSU Prancing J-Settes typically march and perform in rows organized by height. J-Setting dancers also typically perform in a line or in multiple lines. While performing, dancers may also change dance formation similar to the way that marching bands change formation during shows on football fields. The J-Setting style of dress is often modeled after the dance uniforms of the JSU Prancing J-Settes. It normally includes a one or two piece bodysuit or form-fitting garment that covers the torso and crotch; and hosiery with knee high boots on the legs. However, other types of garments are also worn during a performance.https://oaktrust.library.tamu.edu/bitstream/handle/1969.1/151010/WICKS- THESIS-2013.pdf?sequence=1 History and background In 1970, Shirley Middleton and the other majorettes of the Jackson State University Marching Band met with then JSU president, Dr. John A. Peoples, to request that they be permitted to \\"put down their batons.\\" The JSU President agreed; and as the majorette sponsor, Middleton assembled 18 female students to become the first Jaycettes (currently called J-Settes). Middleton, a formally trained ballet dancer, established technical performance standards for the J-Settes, as well as, standards for academic and personal behavior for its members when they were not performing. Dr. Jimmie James, Jr., then Chair of the JSU Department of Music, described the new dance team as \\"the thrill of a thousand eyes.\\" During Middleton's tenure, performances included dance routines to songs such as \\"James Brown's \\"Make it Funky,\\" and \\"Hot Pants\\" as performed by the JSU Marching Band.https://egrove.olemiss.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2227&context;=etd The 2006 Prancing J-Settes homecoming reunion Prior to 1975, Hollis Pippins, a gay former JSU student and baton twirler for the JSU marching band, collaborated with J-Settes director Shirley Middleton on choreography and the creative direction of the danceline. In addition to performing with the JSU marching band, he performed on \\"Soul Train\\" and \\"Putting on the Hits\\" national television shows; and on \\"Black Gold\\", a local TV show. In 1975, Narah Oatis was appointed the sponsor of the Prancing J-Settes. Under her leadership, the \\"J-Sette Walk\\" and other signature marching steps were developed, and performances included an appearance on the \\"30th Anniversary of Motown\\" television show in 1990.https://egrove.olemiss.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2227&context;=etd Narah Oatis resigned from her position in 1997.

Many of them brought the J-Settes dance style to cities outside Mississippi, black gay pride events, and black gay nightclubs throughout the South.https://egrove.olemiss.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2227&context;=etdhttps://www.kqed.org/arts/13885940/if- cities-could-dance-atlanta In 1990, the Prancing J-Settes performed on the nationally televised \\"30th Anniversary of Motown\\" show. In 2003, the Prancing J-Settes performed on the nationally televised \\"34th NAACP Image Awards\\" show. The Prancing J-Settes appeared as part of the JSU marching band in performances with comedian \\"Cedric the Entertainer\\" and \\"Sugar Bear of E.U.\\" In 2008, both Beyonc√©'s \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\" and \\"Diva\\" music videos included a J-Setting style dance routine.

Muhammad took a force of 70 men and when he reached Waddan, the Quraysh were not present. However, the Banu Damrah met with Muhammad and they established a peace agreement for mutual cooperation and safety. No fighting occurred during this campaign.  Events  After Muhammad and his followers had migrated to Medina in 622, the Muslims attacked several of the Quraysh's caravans traveling from Syria to Mecca. During the patrol to Waddan, a Muslim force sought one of the Quraysh's caravans, but was unable to engage with it. The expedition encountered a group of men from the Banu Damrah clan of the Banu Kinanah tribe in the area, and negotiations between the two camps began. A pact of friendship between the Muslims and the Banu Damrah was then produced. According to Muslim scholar Muhammad al-Zurqani, the treaty read: > \\"This document is from Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, concerning the Banu > Damrah in which [Muhammad] establishes for them safety and security in their > wealth and lives. They can expect support from the Muslims unless they > oppose the religion of Allah. They are also expected to respond positively > if the Prophet seeks their help.\\" The treaty meant that both parties were forbidden from raiding each other, joining confederations hostile to one another, or supporting each other's enemies.

Tibetan, Mongolian, Uighur and tribal minorities of China's names are phonetically transcribed into Chinese. In Chinese grammar Names for places in China, when referred to in Chinese contain a class identifier. In English this is often translated, while the rest of the name is not.

Biography Johnny Almond was born in Enfield, Middlesex, England. He played in Zoot Money's Big Roll Band and the Alan Price Set. Among others he worked as a session musician with John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, Chicken Shack and Fleetwood Mac. In 1969 he had founded Johnny Almond's Music Machine and had recorded two solo records \\"Patent Pending\\" and \\"Hollywood Blues\\". On \\"Patent Pending\\" Almond is accompanied by Geoff Condon, Alan White, Jimmy Crawford, Steve Hammond, Roger Sutton and Johnny Wiggins. On \\"Hollywood Blues\\" he jams with Curtis Amy, Hadley Caliman, Joe Harris, Charles Kynard, Ray Neapolitan, Joe Pass, Earl Palmer und Vi Redd. In the same year he joined John Mayall's (post-Bluesbreakers) with whom he toured and recorded The Turning Point (1969) and Empty Rooms (1969). There he met Jon Mark with whom he decided to form Mark-Almond. Mark-Almond's first two albums, Mark-Almond (1971) and Mark-Almond II (1972) were recorded for Bob Krasnow's Blue Thumb label, and were noted for their embossed envelope-style album covers. For the first album, \\"The Ghetto\\" received many plaudits and from the second \\"One Way Sunday\\" was a hit for them in the United States and received radio airplay on album-oriented rock stations in Boston, Massachusetts in 1970. The group then recorded two albums for Columbia Records, Rising (1972) and the live album, Mark-Almond 73 (1973), by which time the group's members had grown to seven. \\"What Am I Living For\\" from Mark-Almond 73 gained the group the most U.S. radio airplay they would get, but nevertheless they disbanded later that year. Notable musicians, who have recorded or toured with Mark-Almond include drummer Dannie Richmond, drummer Billy Cobham, violinist Greg Bloch, keyboardist Tommy Eyre and bassist Roger Sutton. Eyre and Sutton later teamed in Riff Raff. A&M; Records signed the duo in 1978 and released Other Peoples Rooms, but the record did not sell as well as earlier releases. Mark-Almond disbanded again in the mid 1980s, after releasing two decent albums, Tuesday in New York' (1980) and a live offering The Last & Live (1981). In 1996 Mark- Almond reunited again for a CD release, Night Music, which featured keyboardist Mike Nock and others. Almond lived in the San Francisco Bay Area. He occasionally surprised local bar owners, arriving with his sax to jam, some of which was recorded, including a rendition of \\"Stormy Monday\\". He died on 18 November 2009 from cancer, aged 63 in Hayward, California, United States.

Intuitively, :\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}} \\\\delta(tx)\\\\varphi(x)\\\\,dx = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}} \\\\delta(y)\\\\varphi(y/t)\\\\,\\\\frac{dy}{t} = t^{-1}\\\\varphi(0) by making a change of variables y = tx in the \\"integral\\". Moreover, the kth weak derivative of the delta function Œ¥(k) is homogeneous of degree ‚àík‚àí1\\\\. These distributions all have support consisting only of the origin: when localized over }, these distributions are all identically zero. x In one dimension, the function :x_+^\\\\alpha = \\\\begin{cases}x^\\\\alpha&\\\\text{if }x>0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&\\\\text{otherwise}\\\\end{cases} is locally integrable on }, and thus defines a distribution. The distribution is homogeneous of degree Œ±. Similarly x_-^\\\\alpha = (-x)_+^\\\\alpha and x^\\\\alpha = x_+^\\\\alpha + x_-^\\\\alpha are homogeneous distributions of degree Œ±. However, each of these distributions is only locally integrable on all of R provided Re(Œ±) > ‚àí1\\\\. But although the function x_+^\\\\alpha naively defined by the above formula fails to be locally integrable for Re Œ± ‚â§ ‚àí1, the mapping :\\\\alpha\\\\mapsto x_+^\\\\alpha is a holomorphic function from the right half-plane to the topological vector space of tempered distributions. It admits a unique meromorphic extension with simple poles at each negative integer . The resulting extension is homogeneous of degree Œ±, provided Œ± is not a negative integer, since on the one hand the relation :x_+^\\\\alpha[\\\\varphi\\\\circ\\\\mu_t] = t^{\\\\alpha+1}x_+^\\\\alpha[\\\\varphi] holds and is holomorphic in Œ± > 0. On the other hand, both sides extend meromorphically in Œ±, and so remain equal throughout the domain of definition. Throughout the domain of definition, x also satisfies the following properties: * \\\\frac{d}{dx} x_+^\\\\alpha = \\\\alpha x_+^{\\\\alpha-1} * x x_+^\\\\alpha = x_+^{\\\\alpha+1} Other extensions There are several distinct ways to extend the definition of power functions to homogeneous distributions on R at the negative integers. ;œá The poles in x at the negative integers can be removed by renormalizing. Put :\\\\chi_+^\\\\alpha = \\\\frac{x_+^\\\\alpha}{\\\\Gamma(1+\\\\alpha)}. This is an entire function of Œ±. At the negative integers, :\\\\chi_+^{-k} = \\\\delta^{(k-1)}. The distributions \\\\chi_+^a have the properties * \\\\frac{d}{dx} \\\\chi_+^\\\\alpha = \\\\chi_+^{\\\\alpha-1} * x \\\\chi_+^\\\\alpha = \\\\alpha\\\\chi_+^{\\\\alpha+1}. ;\\\\underline{x}^k A second approach is to define the distribution \\\\underline{x}^{-k}, for :\\\\underline{x}^{-k} = \\\\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{(k-1)!}\\\\frac{d^k}{dx^k}\\\\log x. These clearly retain the original properties of power functions: * \\\\frac{d}{dx} \\\\underline{x}^{-k} = -k \\\\underline{x}^{-k-1} * x \\\\underline{x}^{-k} = \\\\underline{x}^{-k+1},\\\\quad\\\\text{if }k>1. These distributions are also characterized by their action on test functions :\\\\underline{x}^{-k} = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{\\\\phi(x) - \\\\sum_{j=0}^{k-1}x^j\\\\phi^{(j)}(0)/j!}{x^k}\\\\,dx, and so generalize the Cauchy principal value distribution of 1/x that arises in the Hilbert transform. ;(x ¬± i0)Œ± Another homogeneous distribution is given by the distributional limit :(x + i0)^\\\\alpha = \\\\lim_{\\\\epsilon\\\\downarrow 0} (x+i\\\\epsilon)^\\\\alpha. That is, acting on test functions :(x + i0)^\\\\alpha[\\\\varphi] = \\\\lim_{\\\\epsilon\\\\downarrow 0} \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}} (x+i\\\\epsilon)^\\\\alpha\\\\varphi(x)\\\\,dx. The branch of the logarithm is chosen to be single-valued in the upper half-plane and to agree with the natural log along the positive real axis. As the limit of entire functions, is an entire function of Œ±. Similarly, :(x-i0)^\\\\alpha = \\\\lim_{\\\\epsilon\\\\downarrow 0} (x-i\\\\epsilon)^\\\\alpha is also a well-defined distribution for all Œ± When Re Œ± > 0, :(x\\\\pm i0)^\\\\alpha = x_+^\\\\alpha + e^{\\\\pm i\\\\pi \\\\alpha}x_-^\\\\alpha, which then holds by analytic continuation whenever Œ± is not a negative integer. By the permanence of functional relations, :\\\\frac{d}{dx} (x\\\\pm i0)^\\\\alpha = \\\\alpha(x\\\\pm i0)^{\\\\alpha-1}. At the negative integers, the identity holds (at the level of distributions on R \\\\ {0}) :(x\\\\pm i0)^{-k}=x_+^{-k} + (-1)^kx_-^{-k}\\\\pm\\\\pi i(-1)^k \\\\frac{\\\\delta^{(k-1)}}{(k-1)!}, and the singularities cancel to give a well- defined distribution on R. The average of the two distributions agrees with \\\\underline{x}^{-k}: :\\\\frac{(x + i0)^{-k}+ (x- i0)^{-k}}{2} = \\\\underline{x}^{-k}. The difference of the two distributions is a multiple of the delta function: :(x + i0)^{-k} - (x- i0)^{-k} = 2\\\\pi i (-1)^k \\\\frac{\\\\delta^{(k-1)}}{(k-1)!}, which is known as the Plemelj jump relation. Classification The following classification theorem holds . Let S be a distribution homogeneous of degree Œ± on }. Then S = a x_+^\\\\alpha + b x_-^\\\\alpha for some constants a, b. Any distribution S on R homogeneous of degree is of this form as well. As a result, every homogeneous distribution of degree on } extends to R. Finally, homogeneous distributions of degree ‚àík, a negative integer, on R are all of the form: :a\\\\underline{x}^{-k} + b\\\\delta^{(k-1)}. Higher dimensions Homogeneous distributions on the Euclidean space } with the origin deleted are always of the form where ∆í is a distribution on the unit sphere Sn‚àí1. The number Œª, which is the degree of the homogeneous distribution S, may be real or complex. Any homogeneous distribution of the form () on } extends uniquely to a homogeneous distribution on Rn provided . In fact, an analytic continuation argument similar to the one-dimensional case extends this for all . References *. * . * .

Individuals can be marginalised and discriminated from society and be restricted to participate in society due to their gender. In Australia, gender inequality denotes the inconsistencies between individuals due to gender. Australian women, men, and transgender and non-binary people all experience aspects of gender inequality. The sections below explain how and why women, men, and transgender and non-binary people experience gender inequality in their daily lives in Australia. Legislation In response to the concerns, the Australian government has implemented various legislation such as the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. The legislation covers the issues of discrimination in education, partnerships, marital status, sexual harassment and potential pregnancy. The Workplace Gender Equality Agency is an Australian Government statutory agency charged with promoting and improving gender equality in Australian workplaces. It is responsible for administering the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012 (which replaced the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act 1999). The Workplace Gender Equality Agency was formerly known as the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency. Current Issues for Women Over half (50.7%) of the Australian population are women. Many of these women experience inequality in numerous aspects of their lives because of their gender. Women often have fewer choice and opportunities compared to men because of their gender. As a result, women are disproportionate to men in their work life and economic aspects, societal roles, and in violence rates in Australia. Work Life and Economics = Gender Pay Gap = The gender pay gap is where men and women do not receive equal pay for equal work. In Australia, the principle of \\"equal pay for equal work\\" was introduced in 1969. Anti-discrimination on the basis of sex waslegislated in 1984.Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, All government statistics in this area do not compare like-for-like roles but are an average on both male and female total wages. Between 1990 and 2009, the gender pay gap remained within a narrow range of between 15 and 17%.National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling. The impact of a sustained gender wage gap on the economy. Report to the Office for Women, Department of Families, Community Services, Housing and Indigenous Affairs, 2009, p. v-vi. In November 2017, the Australian gender pay gap was 15.3%.https://www.wgea.gov.au/sites/default/files/2016-17-gender-equality- scorecard.pdf In 2018, it was reported that Australia‚Äôs full-time gender pay gap was 14.6% and women earnt on average $244.80 per week less than men. It was also reported that Western Australia had the highest pay gap by state and territory (22.4%), while the lowest pay gap was reported in Tasmania (9.7%). As well, the highest pay gap by industry in Australia was Financial and Insurance Services (26.6%) and the lowest pay gap by industry was Public Administration and Safety (5.8%). Studies show that unexplained differences in wages may be due to direct discrimination, or to other unmeasured differences between men and women, calculations do not account for education, experience or area of work so little can be known about the causes.Australian Bureau of Statistics.Average Weekly Earnings, Australia, May 2015. Retrieved on November 21, 2015.Watson, Ian (2010). Decomposing the Gender Pay Gap in the Australian Managerial Labour Market. Australian Journal of Labour Economics, Vol. 13, No. 1, pp. 49-79. Studies that examine the gender pay gap across the entire wage distribution find that the gender pay gap is much greater among high wage earners than among low wage earners even after controlling for various individual and workplace related factors. These results indicate that a glass ceiling may be found in the Australian labour market.Miller, Paul W. (2005). The Role of Gender among Low-Paid and High-Paid Workers. Australian Economic Review, Vol. 38, No. 4, pp. 405-417, quote p. 413-414.Kee, Hiao Joo (2006). Glass Ceiling or Sticky Floor? Exploring the Australian Gender Pay Gap. The Economic Record, Vol. 82, No. 259, pp. 408-427. = Occupational segregation = In Australia, occupational segregation is very present in many industries. Occupations are highly segregated by gender which results in male- dominated occupations and female-dominated occupations. In 2016, it was reported that Construction and Mining industries had the highest representation of men. 88.3% of workers in construction industries and 86.3% in mining industries were men. Whereas, it was reported that Health Care and Social Assistance, and Education and Training industries had the highest representation of women. Women made up 78.3% workers in Health Care and Social Assistance, and Women accounted for 70.9% of Education and Training industries in 2016. It is also important to note that in eight industries women made up less than 40% of all workers in 2016. These industries include Information Media and Telecommunications (37.6%); Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing (30.9%); Wholesale Trade (30.1%); Manufacturing (27.3%); Electricity, Gas, Water and Waste Services (22.4%); Transport, Postal and Warehousing (21.7%); Mining (13.7%); and Construction (11.7%). = Retirement = Many women have substantially lower superannuation payouts for retirement than men in Australia. In 2015-2016, it was reported that the average super payout for an Australian man was $270,710, while the average super payout for an Australian woman was $157,050. This means, the average Australian woman had $113,660 less superannuation for retirement than the average Australian man. As a result of many women having fewer superannuation funds than men, it can often lead to women having financial hardships in retirement. Women are more likely to experience poverty when retired and more likely to be reliant and dependent on the Age Pension compared to men. In 2018, it was reported that 55% of women aged 65 years or more were receiving the Age Pension.  Societal Roles  = Carers = Typically, women take on roles of being carers in society. In 2018, it was reported that 68% of primary carers are women, 70% of primary unpaid carers for children are women, and 58% of primary unpaid carers for the elderly and people with a disability or long-term health conditions are women. As a result, women spend 64.4% of their total work day performing unpaid care work, compared to men who spend 36.1% of their total work day performing unpaid care work. This equates to women spending almost twice as many hours performing unpaid care work each day compared to men. Women are also spending almost three times as much time each day caring for children compared to men.  Violence  = Sexual Harassment and Sexual/Physical Violence = Many Australian women have experienced sexual harassment and/or sexual or physical violence in their lifetime. In 2018, it was reported that one in two women have experienced sexual harassment and one in three women have experienced physical or sexual violence. It is also important to note that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women are more likely to experience sexual harassment and violence. In 2018, it was reported that these women experience violence at around twice the rate of non-Indigenous women. = Domestic Violence = Numerous Australian women have experienced domestic violence in their homes. In 2018, it was reported that one in five Australian women have experienced violence by an intimate partner since the age of 15. It was also reported in 2018 that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women are 34 times more likely to be hospitalised from domestic violence than Australian women. As a result, intimate partner violence is the largest contributor to ill health, death, and disability for many women. This is larger than any other contributor to ill health for women such as obesity, alcohol, and illicit drugs. Due to these high rates, it was estimated in 2015-2016 that domestic violence against women and their children was costing the Australian Government $22 billion. Gender and health Differences in health is illustrated through the data retrieved from the ABS, where it gap between men and women in terms of life expectancy. In 1998, the life expectancy of men was 75.9 compared to 81.5 for women.Greig, Lewins, White, ‚ÄúInequality in Australia‚Äù, p.60. Cambridge University Press, 2003.  Current Issues for Men   Homelessness  Statistics regarding homelessness within Australia have revealed distinct variances in the experiences of differing genders. Of people who stay in boarding houses and ‚Äòsleep rough‚Äô, statistics were largely skewed towards the male population, 74.8% and 67.6% of the homeless population, respectively. However, causes of homelessness differed amongst younger and older populations of homeless males. Whilst younger men aged 15-24 reported family breakdowns, older males were more likely to cite financial crisis, or an inability to afford housing. Among these sub-groups of the male homeless population, recent migrants to Australia were overrepresented, making up 15% of the homeless population. Within this 15%, 60% of migrants identified as male.  Violence  = Male Imprisonment = Within prisons throughout Australia, the male population makes up the majority of those imprisoned. Specifically in New South Wales, over 9 in 10 (92%) of prisoners were male. The rate of male prisoners has continued to increase in recent years. Growing from 398 to 406 prisoners per 100,000 male adult population. Among the imprisoned population of Australia, there is a vast overrepresentation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, accounting for just over a quarter (27%) of the Australian prisoner population. This is despite only accounting for 2% of the Australian population. These incarceration rates regarding male Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander individuals have increased by 22.4% between 2000 and 2010. = Male Crime = The male population of Australia disproportionately commits violence at a much higher rate than the rest of the Australian population. A report released in Victoria by the Crime Statistics Agency reported that around 80% of all crime in Australia was committed by men. A number of scholars regard male supremacy as a driving force in over- representations of men within instances of violence and crime. Psychologist Torrey Orton reiterates this need to have power recognised and acknowledged by greater society therefore contributing to astronomical rates of male crime and violence. (Gilmore, 2017).  Mental Health Issues and Addiction  Male‚Äôs mental health outcomes throughout Australia are disproportionate to those experienced by a number of populations in Australia. Whilst Australian women are more likely to experience general mental illness than men, across all Australian states and territories, men are three times more likely to commit suicide than women. Despite this high prevalence of suicide amongst the Australian male population, only 27% of men sought out professional mental health services, compared to 40% of women. Men also had twice the rate of substance abuse compared to the general population. This rate of substance abuse is also five times more likely amongst those who have previously been incarcerated, which has been shown to be made up of, dominantly, the male population In attempting to explain these disproportionate figures regarding men's mental health in Australia, a qualitative study into men‚Äôs suicide rates identified substantial misinterpretation of men regarding their behaviour and thinking (Player et al., 2015). The CEO of national mental health charity SANE Australia has also stated that, \\"There's a belief that the very idea of being a man is that you deal with stuff and you don't reach out or connect. Untreated, the problem snowballs. The combination of that and the notion of having to deal with it alone, is the reason behind high suicide rates.\\"  Issues for Transgender and Non-Binary People   Work Life and Economics  The economic life of the gender diverse community in Australia is distinctly inconsistent compared to other populations throughout Australia. In study conducted by Beyond Blue into the mental health of transgender Australians, a number of participants identified difficulty in finding employment. This difficulty stemmed directly from their gender identity. Within the same study, contributors also reported instances of loss of employment following the decision to transition, or during their transition process. Apart from difficulty in finding and retaining employment, pay rates for gender diverse individuals differ from those of the greater Australian community. Dawn Hough, director of support program ‚ÄòPride in Diversity‚Äô, puts forth that pay equity rates for transgender and intersex individuals may be even lower than others in the LGBTQI community.  Societal Discrimination  Within Australian society, transgender and other gender diverse peoples have experienced dramatic occurrences of harassment and discrimination. These examples of harassment and discrimination occur in a variety of ways. Purposely misgendering an individual who identifies as gender diverse is an act of discrimination with severe ramifications for the mental health of transgender peoples. Australia came a close second to the United States of America in stating that they would intentionally misgender a trans person as an act of disrespect. Considering these statistics, it is unsurprising that this same survey also found that only two in five cisgender individuals were willing to use correct pronouns when referring to transgender peoples. Even smaller, only one in five would use the gender neutral term ‚Äòthey‚Äô when referring to non-binary or gender non-conforming individuals. Other occurrences of discrimination include forms of verbal and physical abuse. In terms of verbal abuse, around two in three (66%) of trans and gender diverse people reported that they had experienced verbal abuse based solely on their gender identity (Smith et al., 2014). This harassment was most often expressed by strangers calling out to them on streets, yet also involved abuse delivered by immediate family members in close confines (Smith et al., 2014). More than one in five (21%), transgender and gender diverse individuals also stated that they had experienced physical abuse (Smith et al., 2014). These occurrences most often occurred on the street, yet were also closely followed by instances of violence at school and on public transport (Smith et al., 2014). Unsurprisingly, the same study also revealed that 43% of trans and gender non- conforming individuals felt unsafe on public streets, with 32% also feeling unsafe on public transport (Smith et al., 2014).. It was also shown that transgender and gender diverse people actively avoided some public places for their own safety. These places were most often gendered spaces, including bathrooms and public change rooms (Smith et al., 2014).  Mental Health  Transgender and gender diverse individuals have been proven to have dramatically reduced mental health outcomes than the greater Australian population. Trans individuals have been identified as a high-risk group for suicide, with one in five respondents reporting they had thoughts of suicidal ideation or self-harm in at least half the days of the previous fortnight. Within the same survey, over half (57.2%) of respondents reported they had been diagnosed with depression, with younger individuals more likely to report poorer mental health than older respondents (Smith et al., 2014). Authors of the study also identified trans women as being over five times more likely to commit suicide than the general population, whilst trans men were more than double (Smith et al., 2014). Authors of the study could not pinpoint the exact reasoning for this discrepancy in mental health outcomes even among trans individuals. However, those analysing this data reported that this might be due to trans women having fewer sources of support, as they more often live alone (Smith et al., 2014).. Authors also noted that trans women might find it more difficult to transition within society, due to the powerful effects of testosterone on bone structure (Smith et al., 2014). In regards to factors affecting a positive effect on their mental health, transgender and gender diverse peoples reported that feeling acknowledged and supported in their gender identity along with feeling free to express their identity as they wish had positive repercussions on their mental health outcomes (Smith et al., 2014). Factors that had distinct negative impacts on mental health included, obviously, discrimination and harassment (Smith et al., 2014). Other negative impacts included dysmorphia, due to being unable to ‚Äòmedically‚Äô transition. This is often a result of excessive medical costs. Feeling unaccepted by friends and family, along with the general public also had distinct negative impacts on mental health outcomes (Smith et al., 2014).  Health Disparities  There are clear disparities in the mental health outcomes for that of the trans and gender diverse populations. However, disparities also arise in the provision of health services, along with experiences of general health outcomes There is a distinct underutilisation of a number of medical and clinical health services among transgender and gender diverse individuals. A small Western Australian study conducted in 2006 with 50 transgender and gender diverse adults reported significant underutilisation of cervical pap smears and mammograms (Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex Health and Wellbeing Ministerial Advisory Committee, 2014). It was also discovered that whilst often utilising the services of general practitioners, trans and gender diverse individuals had experienced a breadth of harassment and discrimination when accessing these health services (Riggs & Due, 2013). Feelings of having to educate practitioners on their own gender identify especially led to participants feeling less respected (Riggs & Due, 2013).  Issues in Transgender and Non-binary the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Population  Western terminology is often inadequate in discussions regarding the gender identity of Indigenous communities. In an Australian context, the terminology of ‚Äòsistergirls‚Äô and ‚Äòbrotherboys‚Äô is used to describe gender diverse Indigenous Australians (Toone 2015). It has been proven that these aspects of Indigenous identity existed long before western colonialism (Toone 2015). The organisation Sisters and Brothers NT also state that, ‚ÄúThere is documented evidence and oral history of Sistergirl identity in some communities pre-dating colonisation. A number of historic and contemporary words exist to describe Sistergirls including ‚ÄúKwarte Kwarte‚Äù in Arrente, ‚ÄúKungka Kungka‚Äù in Pitjantjatjara and Luritja, ‚ÄúYimpininni‚Äù in Tiwi, ‚ÄúKarnta Pia‚Äù in Warlpiri which can be interpreted as ‚Äúlike a girl‚Äù. Whilst ‚ÄúKungka Wati‚Äù in Pintipi and ‚ÄúGirriji Kati‚Äù in Waramungu literally mean ‚Äúwoman/man.‚Äù (Toone 2015) Due to this intersection as members of the LGBTQI community and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, the discrimination experienced by these individuals is at an extremely significant level, even when compared to the harassment experienced by other members of the transgender and gender diverse community (Kerry, 2015). These additional experiences of racism, even encountered within the LGBTQI community, along with facing transphobia within their traditional communities have led to distinct experiences of oppression unique to this community (Kerry, 2015).

He was also adviser to several sultans of Zanzibar. Biography Al-Amawƒ´ was born in the city of Barawa to the Ra Ma'limu clan, where he pursued studies under several well-known scholars, such as Sayyid Ab≈´ Bakr al-Mi·∏•·∏çƒÅr al- ·∏§a·∏çramƒ´, ·∏§ƒÅjj ‚ÄòAlƒ´ b. ‚ÄòAbd al-Ra·∏•mƒÅn, and the North African scholar Sayyid A·∏•mad al-Maghribƒ´. Al-Amawƒ´ left Barawa for Zanzibar in his teens to study under Muhyi al-Din al-Qahtani, the chief ShƒÅfi‚Äòƒ´ qƒÅdƒ´ of Zanzibar. Al-Qahtani introduced him to the sultan of Zanzibar, Sayyid Sa'id bin Sultan. In 1854, al-Amawƒ´, who was then only sixteen years old, was appointed by the Sultan as the Qadi (judge) of Kilwa.pg 538 ‚Äì Notes on Some Members of the Learned Classes of Zanzibar and East Africa in the Nineteenth Century, by B. G. Martin ‚Äì African Historical Studies, 1971 Al-Amawƒ´ was soon transferred to Zanzibar, where he served until 1891, when his son BurhƒÅn took the position. Al-Amawƒ´ wrote on theology, law, Sufism, grammar, rhetoric, and history, and composed an unfinished Swahili-Arabic dictionary. He also served as a political advisor, ambassador, and diplomat in Somalia, the Comoro islands, the Rovuma River region, and various other places on the African mainland on behalf of two of Zanzibar's sultans, Sayyid MƒÅjid (r. 1856‚Äì70) and Sayyid Barghash (r. 1870‚Äì88). Abdallah Salih Farsy wrote that al-Amawƒ´ became a virtual prime minister during the reign of Sayyid Khalƒ´fa (r. 1888‚Äì90).Abdallah Salih Farsy, The Shafi'i Ulama of East Africa, ca. 1830‚Äì1970: A Hagiographic Account, trans. and ed. Randall L. Pouwels (Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin African Studies Program, 1989), 46‚Äì48. Although Farsy said all of his writings were missing, since 2000 portions of his writings, all unpublished, were located in Dar Es Salaam (copies of which can be found in the Zanzibar National Archives) and in the library of Sayyid Muhammad ƒÄl B≈´ Sa‚Äòƒ´dƒ´ in Seeb, Oman. They include portions of his diaries from two of his six journeys in the Rovuma region, a history of the B≈´ Sa ªƒ´dƒ´ dynasty, Sufi and devotional texts, a work on rhetoric, and a theological poem following the doctrines of the Ash‚Äòarite school of Sunni Islam, ‚ÄòIqd al-la‚ÄôƒÅlƒ´ (Necklace of Pearls), with a lengthy commentary, Taqrƒ´b ‚ÄòIqd al-la‚ÄôƒÅlƒ´ ilƒÅ fahm al-atfƒÅli . This poem was written in response to a twelfth-century theological poem, Bad‚Äô al-ƒÅmƒÅl, written by SirƒÅj al-Dƒ´n ‚ÄòAlƒ´ b.‚ÄòUthmƒÅn al-≈™shƒ´ al-FarghƒÅnƒ´, following the doctrines of the MƒÅturidite school of Sunni Islam. Randall Pouwels writes that al-Amawƒ´‚Äôs success as a Sufi shaykh led to many conversions from IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ Islam (to which the ruling class of Zanzibar belonged) to Sunni Islam, making him an embarrassment to Sayyid Barghash, who banned him from attending Friday prayers at the mosque. According to Pouwels, al-Amawƒ´ countered by showing up at the mosque armed, with his followers, forcing the sultan to back down‚Äîbut not without first imprisoning al-Amawƒ´, although al-Amawƒ´‚Äôs popularity forced Barghash to keep his incarceration brief.Randall L. Pouwels, Horn and Crescent: Cultural Change and Traditional Islam on the East African Coast, 800‚Äì1900 (Cambridge University Press, 1987), 119‚Äì120. However, whereas Pouwels presents al-Amawƒ´ as a thorn in Barghash‚Äôs side and a pest to sultans in general, with the exception of Khalƒ´fa, in a fragment of his writing found in Dar Es Salaam, al-Amawƒ´ presents himself consistently as a close counselor and confidant of the sultan. Likewise, in the fragments of his accounts of his journeys to the Rovuma River region on behalf of Sayyid Barghash, found in the B≈´ Sa‚Äòƒ´dƒ´ in Oman, he always describes himself as ‚Äúa servant of our lord the Sayyid,‚Äù ever striving on behalf of the interests of the state. Although Farsy reports that of all Muslim shaykhs on the coast, al-Amawƒ´ was the most skilled at and involved in debating Christian missionaries,Farsy, 43‚Äì44. it is nonetheless also true that he assisted Bishop Edward Steere, who served in Zanzibar from 1864 until his death in 1882, by helping in the translation of some of the Psalms and the Gospel of Luke into Swahili (Steere 1883; Steere1884: vi‚Äìvii; Mojola 2001: 514).Edward Steere, A Handbook of theSwahili Language as Spoken at Zanzibar (London: Society for the Promotionof Christian Knowledge, 1884), vi‚Äìvii.Aloo Osotsi Mojola, ‚ÄúThe Swahili Bible in EastAfrica from 1844 to 1996: A brief survey with special reference to Tanzania,‚Äù in The Bible in Africa: Transactions, Trajectories and Trends, ed.Gerald O. West and Musa W. Dube (Leiden: Brill, 2001), 514. Steere also wrote that he held weekly meetings with local Muslim shaykhs in his home, and it is likely that al-Amawƒ´ was a participant. In one letter he wrote, ‚ÄúAbdul Aziz called and asked for an explanation of the statement that man was made ‚Äòin the image of God,‚Äô which shocked them. I wrote and sent him an explanation in Swahili.‚Äù In one of the Dar es Salaam fragments, al-Amawƒ´ mentions a debate moderated by Sir Arthur Hardinge that he had with Bishop Chauncy Maples in the Anglican cathedral in Zanzibar. Al-Amawƒ´ says that he had known Maples since the days of Bishop Steere, and proceeds to cite the precise hour of Steere‚Äôs death‚Äîa sign, perhaps, of a close relationship between them.

Ramey learned to fly in 1918 during World War I and served as an instructor at the Air Corps Advanced Flying School and as a staff officer with the 1st Bombardment Wing between the wars. He was commander of the IV Bomber Command from 12 August 1942 to 8 November 1942, and was promoted to brigadier general on 17 September 1942. In November 1942, he became deputy commander of the Seventh Air Force in Hawaii. In January 1943 he became the commander of the V Bomber Command in Australia and Papua, which he led during the Battle of the Bismarck Sea. In March 1943 he disappeared on a reconnaissance flight over the Torres Strait. Neither his aircraft nor his body has ever been found. Early life Howard Knox Ramey was born in Waynesboro, Mississippi on 28 June 1896. He attended Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College from 1915 to 1917. In December 1917 he enlisted as a private first class in the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps, in which he was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 20 April 1918. Between the wars alt=Air Service officer wearing garrison cap and uniform with Sam Browne belt. In July 1920, Ramey received a permanent commission as a first lieutenant in the United States Army Air Service. He attended the Air Service Photography School in 1921, and became commander of the 6th Photo Section at Camp Nichols in the Philippines from January to October 1925. He then served as intelligence officer there until he returned to the United States in February 1927. He commanded the 22nd Photo Section at Kelly Field, San Antonio, Texas from 1927 to 1928, and was an instructor at the Air Corps Advanced Flying School there from 1928 to 1931. After more than ten years as a first lieutenant, Ramey was finally promoted to captain on 1 March 1932. On 26 March 1934, Ramey was one of 35 American World War I military pilots who founded the Order of the Daedalians, a fraternal order of military pilots. He attended the Air Corps Tactical School at Maxwell Field, Alabama, graduating in 1934, and then the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, graduating in 1936. Shortly afterwards, he was promoted to major on 16 June 1936. Ramey served as operations officer and assistant chief of staff for intelligence of the 1st Bombardment Wing at March Field, California from 1936 to 1941. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 30 December 1940. World War II Ramey was deputy chief of staff for operations (G-3) of the Fourth Air Force from January to August 1942, with the rank of colonel from 5 January 1942. He was commander of the IV Bomber Command from 12 August 1942 to 8 November 1942, and was promoted to brigadier general on 17 September 1942. In November 1942, he became deputy commander of the Seventh Air Force. Following the death of the commander of the V Bomber Command, Brigadier General Kenneth Walker, in an air raid over Rabaul in January 1943, the commander of the Fifth Air Force, Lieutenant General George Kenney asked Lieutenant General Henry H. Arnold, the chief of Army Air Forces to send Ramey to Australia as a replacement. The two men had known each other for years and Ramey had recently been on Kenney's staff when Kenney was commander of the Fourth Air Force. \\"I had a lot of confidence in him,\\" Kenney later wrote, \\"and believed he would do a real job for me. Arnold replied the next day that I could have him.\\" Ramey assumed command of V Bomber Command in January 1943. After the arguments over bombing tactics with Walker, Kenney was pleased that Ramey liked the skip bombing tactics the Fifth Air Force was developing. These tactics were put in practice with devastating effect at the Battle of the Bismarck Sea in March 1943. Death and legacy On 26 March 1943, Ramey took off from Port Moresby in the B-17 Flying Fortress #41-24384, \\"Pluto\\", to carry out a scheduled seven-hour reconnaissance flight to Merauke and Horn Island. A message from the radio operator twenty minutes after take-off was the last that was ever heard from the aircraft. An extensive air search was conducted but no sign was found of the aircraft or the twelve men on board. Ramey was declared dead on 19 November 1945. He left behind a wife and two daughters. Ramey Air Force Base in Puerto Rico was named in his honour. In February 2007, diver Ben Cropp reported that he had found the wreckage of the plane. However, the plane turned out to have been a misidentified C-47. The location of the wreck of \\"Pluto\\" remains unknown.

The victory of the Bolshevik Red Army enabled them to set up the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Throughout the civil war various religions, secularists and anti-clericalists of the Bolsheviks played a key role in the military and social struggles which occurred during the war. Religious situation before the October Revolution Since 1721 the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) had been the established church of the Russian Empire. The church reforms introduced by Peter I introduced a period of Caesaropapism to the ROC. This meant that while the ROC enjoyed substantial privileges, it was nevertheless subordinated to the state. As the intelligentsia became more critical of the Tsarist regime, this was often accompanied by a rejection of the ROC, and sometimes by a rejection of religion in general. Others, such as Leo Tolstoy retained a strong Christian belief but rejected the autocracy. He was excommunicated by the ROC. Some Bolsheviks, such as Vladimir Bonch-Bruyevich became involved with the religious minorities collectively called the \\"sectarians\\". Bonch- Bruyevich joined Tolstoy and Vladimir Chertkov in supporting the Dukhobors, even sailing with a group of them when they migrated to Canada.O.A. Golinenko (–û.–ê. –ì–û–õ–ò–ù–ï–ù–ö–û) \\"Leo Tolstoy's questions to a Doukhobor\\" (–í–û–ü–†–û–°–´ –õ.–ù. –¢–û–õ–°–¢–û–ì–û –î–£–•–û–ë–û–†–£) In 1914 there were 55,173 Russian Orthodox churches and 29,593 chapels, 112,629 priests and deacons, 550 monasteries and 475 convents with a total of 95,259 monks and nuns in Russia. Following the Bolshevik seizure of power Eleven days following the storming of the Winter PalaceNathaniel Davis, A Long Walk to Church: A Contemporary History of Russian Orthodoxy, Westview Press, 2003, 1 a council of the Russian Orthodox church reestablished the patriarchate (it had been abolished under Peter the Great in 1721Tatiana A. Chumachenko. Edited and Translated by Edward E. Roslof. Church and State in Soviet Russia: Russian Orthodoxy from World War II to the Khrushchev years. ME Sharpe inc., 2002 16 ) and elected Metropolitan Tikhon of Moscow (Vassily I. BellavinBecker, Winfried. \\"Diplomats and missionaries: the role played by the German embassies in Moscow and Rome in the relations between Russia and the Vatican from 1921 to 1929.\\" The Catholic Historical Review 92.1 (2006)) as patriarch. Tikhon refused to take sides in the civil war,Davis p. 2 although the official Bolshevik propaganda presented him, as well as the Church, as supporting the whites. The Bolsheviks used the alleged support of the Russian Orthodox Church for the Whites as their justification for killing clergy in massive numbers. Following the Bolshevik seizure of power, one issue they faced was the removal of the privileged position of the ROC. The Declaration of the Rights of the Peoples of Russia (November 2/15, 1917) removed special privileges based on faith or nationality. This was soon followed by a decision by Sovnarkom to confiscate all the ROC's monasteries and educational establishments. When the Bolsheviks seized the Holy Synod's printing house, relations between them and the ROC became further strained. One issue was removing Orthodox Christian symbolism from state buildings. However, the Bolsheviks did not prioritise anti- religious campaigning, because they were concerned about how this would affect the popularity of the new regime.  Persecution of the Church during the Civil War  During the Russian Civil War, the Red Army massacred large numbers of clergy and believers often on grounds of alleged support for the Whites; much of these killings were not officially instigated from the top, but were done on the initiative of local units of soldiers.Paul Froese. Forced Secularization in Soviet Russia: Why an Atheistic Monopoly Failed. Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, Vol. 43, No. 1 (Mar., 2004), pp. 35-50 In later years, the church would declare that the excommunication was a misunderstanding based on the belief that these killings were officially instigated (however, they were never officially repudiated either).Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988) However, later Soviet authors would claim central responsibility for these actions, including Yemelyan Yaroslavsky (who was a participant in these killings) who justified the campaign by claiming that the church was fighting against them. Many monasteries were attacked. Holy Mountain Monastery near Kharkov was plundered very early in the civil war. In a nearby skete in the village of Gorokhova a monk named Izrail was murdered for refusing to hand over the keys to the skete cellars. In the same area, a religious procession was attacked on its way as it rested the night, and two priests, a deacon, the owner of the cottage where they were staying at as well as his daughter were all killed.Pospielovsky p. 10 Metropolitan Vladimir (Bogoyavlensky) of Kiev was the first bishop killed by the Bolsheviks on January 25, 1918. He had consistently opposed the revolution, and he was severely beaten as well as tortured before being shot outside the Monastery of the Caves. Before being shot by his murderers he prayed to God for them to be forgiven.Pospielovsky pp. 9-10 In the Don region in February 1918 the Reds were killing every priest they could find. An 80-year-old monk-priest named Amvrosi was beaten with rifle butts before being killed. A priest named Dimitri was brought to a cemetery and undressed, but when he tried to cross himself before being killed, a soldier chopped off his right arm. An old priest who tried to stop the execution of a peasant was beaten and cut to pieces with swords. In the Holy Saviour Monastery, Red soldiers arrested and killed the 75-year-old abbot by scalping him and beheading him. In the Kherson province a priest was crucified. In a Kuban Cossack village an eighty-year-old priest was forced to wear women's clothing, brought to the village square and ordered to dance; when he refused, he was hanged.Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988). pp. 10-11 In the Kuban Cossack village of Plotavy, Fr Yakov Vladimirov was targeted by the Chekists for his popularity. They executed him along with wife and one of his sons (he had two sons, but they killed a different child in place of that son by mistake).Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti- Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988). p. 11 Bishop Hermogenes (Dolganyov) of Tobolsk, was killed along with other detainees on 16 June 1918 by drowning. He had organized a religious procession the day after the Tsar had come through Tobolsk on their way to Ekaterinburg (April 28), in which he blessed the Royal family. He was arrested the following week and the Soviets promised to release him for 10,000 roubles, and later 100,000 roubles. When the ransom was collected and submitted, the delegation of notables and clergy that had delivered it were arrested as well (and later executed). Germogen was reportedly taken on a river steamer, rocks were attached to his head and he was thrown into the water.Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988). pp. 2-3. In Voronezh, seven nuns who had prayed for a White victory were reportedly boiled in a cauldron of tar. Archbishop Joachim of Nizhni Novgorod was murdered by red forces who hanged him head down on the iconostasis above the central 'Royal Doors'. The clergy in the Crimea suffered terribly: one priest named Ugliansky was killed by Red forces on grounds that he used green ribbons instead of red ribbons on the church icon lamps. Churches in Simferopol, Feodosia and other parts of the Crimea were desecrated and their clergy were brutally murdered.Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti- Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988). p. 3 Filosof Ornatsky, a priest in Petrograd, was arrested in the spring of 1918 after giving a public requiem for victims of the Bolsheviks. He and thirty-two others were driven to a cliff overlooking the Gulf of Finland, where the priest was allowed to perform a brief funeral service and bless the victims, before they were all shot and dropped into the sea. Archpriest John Vostorgov in Moscow, a famous Orthodox missionary and church activist, preached against the Bolsheviks and as a result he was black-mailed by the Bolsheviks, arrested and executed. He was executed along with Roman Catholic priest Lutoslawski and his brother, two tsarist ministers (N. Maklakov and Alexei Khvostov), an Orthodox bishop Efren, former State Council Chairman Ivan Shcheglovitov and Senator S. Beletsky. Fr Vostorgov conducted a short funeral service and preached to his victims to face death as a sacrifice of atonement, after which each victim came forward to be blessed by Fr Vostorgov and the Bishop; then they were shot.Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988). pp. 3-4. During the Red occupation of Stavropol diocese in 1918, the Bolsheviks killed at least 52 Orthodox priests, four deacons and four lectors. Priest Alexander Podolsky was tortured and killed for giving a Te Deum service for a Cossack regiment before it attacked the Bolsheviks. When a peasant came to collect his body, the peasant was shot dead on the spot. Fr Alexei Miliutinsky was tortured, scalped and killed for preaching to Red army soldiers that they were leading Russia to disaster and for offering prayers for the Cossacks. Even left-wing priests could be killed, such as Ivan Prigorsky who was taken out of church on Holy Saturday into the street, where Red soldiers cursed him, mutilated his face and then killed him.Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988). p. 5 In the diocese of Perm, during 1918, at least 42 churchmen were murdered.Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988). p. 5. A priest in Perm was killed by the Cheka who cut out his cheeks and eyes, and then paraded him through the streets before he was buried alive. Adronik, the archbishop of Perm, was arrested immediately after the rite of anathema was performed in his cathedral. He was probably executed some time shortly after December 1919. As a result of the unusual situation in which the local residents gave the Cheka popular support for these actions, they followed up Adronik's murder with mass killings of Perm's clergy including vicar-bishop Feofan of Solikamsk. A delegation from the All- Russian Church Sobor in Moscow went to Perm to investigate what had happened. While returning, however, their train was boarded and they were all shot by Red soldiers.Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988). pp. 6-7. Yakov Sverdlov (\\"president\\" of Soviet Russia) ordered in June 1918 to take hostages from the ranks of industrial entrepreneurs, members of the Liberal and Menshevik parties as well as the clergy. Few of these hostages would survive. In the town of Chorny Yar on the Volga, a lay missionary named Lev Z. Kunsevich, proclaimed the Patriarch's encyclical to a crowd of people. Kunsevich was arrested and publicly shot in July 1918.Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti- Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988). p. 6. Bishop Macarius (Gnevushev) of Vyazma, who was beloved by the local population, was arrested as a result of his popularity in the summer of 1918. He was executed along with fourteen others in a field near Smolensk, whom he ministered and attempted to comfort with blessings before their execution. One of the soldiers who executed him afterward confessed on his deathbed that he had killed a saint.Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988). p. 7. Bishop Nikodim (Kononov) (ru) of Belgorod, condemned acts of violence, plunder and murder in his sermons and he was arrested by the local Cheka commandant, Saenko, at Christmas 1918. Resistance from the population in protest to his arrest, caused Saenko to release him and ordered him not to preach those things again. The bishop continued to preach these things, however, and he was arrested again. A priest's wife who went to plead on the bishop's behalf was executed on the spot. The bishop was killed soon after, but they disguised his corpse to make it look like a soldier and threw it into the common graveyard.Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988). p. 8 Between June 1918 and January 1919, in Russia (but not including the Volga, Kama and several other regions) there were killed 1 metropolitan, 18 bishops, 102 priests, 154 deacons, 94 monks and nuns, and there were imprisoned four bishops, and 211 priests. The state sequestered 718 parishes and 15 monasteries, it closed 94 churches and 26 monasteries, it desecrated 14 churches and 9 chapels, it forbade 18 religious processions, it dispersed by force 41 religious processions, and it interrupted church services with insults to religious feelings in 22 cities and 96 villages.Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988). pp. 14-15 On January 14, 1919, in the Estonian University town of Tartu, retreating Red soldiers killed twenty clerics. Among those killed was Bishop Platon (Kulbusch) of Tallinn, two orthodox priests, a Lutheran pastor and sixteen laymen.Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988). p. 10 Bishop Leontius (von Wimpffen) was murdered along with most of the diocesan clergy in 1919 after he made a sermon that quoted Jesus' words \\"I was naked and you have clothed me, I was ill and you looked after me\\" and this quotation was interpreted as an attack against the Bolsheviks.Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988). p. 8. In Kharkov, a priest named Mokovsky was executed for criticizing the Bolsheviks in his sermons. When his wife came to get his body, the Cheka chopped off her limbs, pierced her breasts and killed her. In the village of Popasnaia in the Donets Coal Basin, the priest Dragozhinsky was executed for a sermon that was interpreted as an attack on the Reds. A priest named Shangin was murdered and his body was cut in pieces. Arch-priest Surtsov was beaten for several days before he was shot and his body was thrown into the Pechora river. In the town of Pechora an old priest named Rasputin was tied to a telegraph pole, then shot and then his body was given to dogs to eat. In Seletsk Afanasii Smirnov, a psalmist was executed for giving a funeral litany over a dead French soldier. The Bolsheviks closed churches and used them for other purposes. There were accounts of drunken orgies taking place in the desecrated churches. The pretexts for these killings was usually alleged support for the enemy, criticism of the Bolsheviks and/or their ideology, or for liberal and/or bourgeois sympathies. Telling people to follow God's laws above what the state directed was also used as a pretext for their killing. The uncertainty of the revolution's success in the early years may also have triggered some paranoia among the Bolsheviks towards groups that they considered threatening. The orthodox church must have thought that the Bolsheviks would lose power, because after Tikhon's election it declared that the Russian Orthodox Church was the national church of Russia, that the state needed church approval to legislate on church matters, that blasphemy should remain illegal, that church schools should be recognized and that the head of the state as well as the top appointees in education as well as religious affairs should be Orthodox. The Orthodox were the primary target due to their association with the old regime,Letters of Metropolitan Sergius (Voskresensky) of Vilnius http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Letters_of_Metropolitan_Sergii_of_Vilnius although other religions were attacked as well.Sabrina Petra Ramet, Ed., Religious Policy in the Soviet Union. Cambridge University Press (1993). P 5-6 A Polish priest named Krapiwnicki in 1918 was arrested on the feast of Corpus Christi and scheduled for execution, but the execution was called off after intervention from the Polish government. After the Papal protest against the persecution of the Orthodox church, the regime retaliated by arresting Archbishop de Ropp of the Roman Catholic diocese of Mogilev in April 1919, but he was later released to Poland in exchange for a Polish communist named Radek who had been arrested in Poland.Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti- Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988). pp. 13-14 Despite the fact that non-Orthodox religions had been persecuted under Tsarist Russia, leaders of other faith communities (Christians, Muslims and Jews) gave messages of sympathy to the Orthodox church during this time.Letters from Moscow, Gleb Yakunin and Lev Regelson, Many of these sects that had been persecuted by the Orthodox state found themselves better prepared for the situation post-1917 than the Orthodox church. The state initially showed a friendly attitude towards Protestant evangelicals and Muslims,Froese, Paul. \\"'I am an atheist and a Muslim': Islam, communism, and ideological competition.\\" Journal of Church and State 47.3 (2005) while maintaining some pretense that they were only fighting against the Orthodox hierarchy for its relationship with the Tsar and not against religion generally. The leader of Russia's Protestant evangelicals, Ivan Prokhanov, joined the Bolsheviks in denouncing the Orthodox church as reactionary.Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988). p. 18 The Mennonite community numbered 110,000 in 1917, and it would emigrate from Russia in massive numbers in the following decade.Christel Lane. Christian religion in the Soviet Union: A sociological study. University of New York Press, 1978, p. 201 There were 1.6 million Roman Catholics on the territory of the new state in 1917.Christel Lane. Christian religion in the Soviet Union: A sociological study. University of New York Press, 1978, p. 240 There had been over 15 million prior to the war, but after Poland and the western territories were lost, this number shrunk greatly. Christians outside of orthodoxy would actually have some benefit of increasing membership in the succeeding years even while the Orthodox church declined in membership. In 1900 about 11 percent of the population were Christians belonging to non-Orthodox groupings (not including Roman Catholics) and by 1970 this number had become 31 percent.  Muslims  Many Muslims in the Russian Empire were attracted to the Bolsheviks' anti-imperialist stance, due to the imperialism of Western powers over Muslim nations. The Muslim Socialist Committee of Kazan (MSK; Russian: –ú—É—Å—É–ª—å–º–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–æ—Ü–∏–∞–ª–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∫–æ–º–∏—Ç–µ—Ç) was established following the February Revolution. Despite their hard anti- religious stance, the Bolsheviks in the years following the revolution and during the civil war, were in a very poor position to fight against Islam in Central Asia. Therefore, the Bolsheviks appealed to them as allies and promised them political independence and religious freedom. Lenin even voiced admiration of Muslims who had fought against imperialism and saw Muslim folk heroes as emblems of the struggle against imperialism. In 1917 the Bolsheviks made this pronouncement to Muslims in Russia: > To all toiling Moslems of Russia and the East, whose mosques and prayer- > houses have been destroyed, whose beliefs have been trampled on by the czars > and the oppressors of Russia. Your beliefs and customs, your national and > cultural institutions are declared henceforth free and inviolable. Organize > your national life freely and without hindrance. This is your right. Know > that your rights ... are protected by the entire might of the revolution and > its organs.... Support this revolution and its government! Many Muslims embraced this call and saw this revolution as a means of empowering Islam. An influential group of Central Asian Marxists led by Sultan Galiev then took the initiative to try to reform Islam for the modern era and they were accepted by the state as a buffer between itself and the native population of the central Asian republics.  Reaction of the populace  Much of the population were relatively indifferent to the fate of the Church. However, some portion of the population stood up in the Church's defence, and ensured its continued survival in the face of the onslaught. The power of the Church had been declining since the February revolution. When the February revolution had made attendance for soldiers at services and acceptance of the sacraments voluntary, both declined from 100% to 10%. Church attendance began to raise itself again after Bolshevik atrocities became more widespread. The populations of some areas protected their churches and clergy, and even to pay for church costs after the state deprived it of any funding; after the elimination of all state support for religion, congregations had to rely entirely upon voluntary donations and voluntary support from their parishioners in order to continue.Gregory L. Freeze. Counter-Reformation in Russian Orthodoxy: Popular Response to Religious Innovation, 1922-1925. Slavic Review, Vol. 54, No. 2 (Summer, 1995), pp. 305-339 The Te Deum service was banned, but in some places such services in defiance. Some places, such as the city of Iuzovka (Donetsk) the miners and industrial workers threatened the Bolsheviks with rebellion if they harmed the clergy or the Church, and the Bolsheviks took no action as a result. In other places, the people were so afraid of the terror tactics that they remained passive and even clergymen would give in to obedience to Bolshevik demands.Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988). pp. 16-17 In the major cities, large crowds of laity cooperated and acted critically to save the churches there. In Petrograd in January 1918 Alexandra Kollontai, the Bolshevik commissar for social welfare sent troops to the Alexander-Nevski Monastery to confiscate it (officially) for social welfare purposes, and huge crowds of laity came to defend it. The troops opened fire on the crowd, but the laity kept their ground and would not be dispersed. Shortly afterward a religious procession in Petrograd with Metropolitan Veniamin at its head marched through the city with several hundred thousand participants. Leagues of laymen began to form in many cities for the Church's defence. In Moscow and Petrograd 6-10% of their population joined these leagues. These leagues took action in preventing the state from taking over monasteries. Between February to May 1918 687 persons were killed in clashes between these leagues and the government.Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988). p. 17 These leagues were effective in saving the Church, partly because the state found it harder to ignore the working masses who constituted these leagues than they did in ignoring the disenfranchised clergy. Nationalization of church property Lenin's decree on the separation of church and state on January 23, 1918 (Julian calendar) deprived the formerly official church of its status of legal person,Olga Tchepournaya.

ME Sharpe inc., 2002 p. 3 All theological schools were closed as well as all monasteries and convents eventually. With the eradication of the church's legal status, the laity of the Russian Orthodox Church increasingly gained control over their parishes, which led to some conflicts between the laity and clergy. The new government for the next few years launched a campaign to seize church property.Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) p. 27 Churches were closed, and could be converted to other uses, such as government departments, collective farm community centers, and warehouses. This order to seize property was carried out with ruthless violence by Red soldiers. They often opened fire on crowds that surrounded churches in an attempt to defend them and on religious processions in protest against Church persecution. Thousands were killed in this way, especially in the spring of 1918. Shooting down of religious processions are well documented in Voronezh, Shatsk (Tambov province), and Tula (where thirteen were killed and many wounded, including Bishop Kornilii).Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti- Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988). p. 12 Patriarch Tikhon excommunicated the Soviet leadership on January 19, 1918 (Julian calendar) for conducting this campaign.Nathaniel Davis, A Long Walk to Church: A Contemporary History of Russian Orthodoxy, Westview Press, 2003, 2 In retaliation the regime arrested and killed dozens of bishops, thousands of the lower clergy and monastics, and multitudes of laity.Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. The Russian Church Under the Soviet Regime, 1917-1983 (Crestwood NY.: St Vladimir's Seminary Press, 1984) ch 2. The seizing of church property over the next few years would be marked by a brutal campaign of violent terror. High ranking Orthodox bishops issued reports that called for the church to focus more on combatting atheism among the Russian populace in 1918‚Äì1919. They also issued statements of concern over liturgical changes that were being carried out by priests. Suppression of miracles It was ideologically important for the government to suppress and disprove accounts of miracles that contradicted Marxist atheism. To this effect the government issued a decree on March 1, 1919, regarding \\"the complete liquidation of the cult of corpses and mummies\\", which ordered the public exposure of saints' relics in order to show them to be frauds (to counter the belief that the saints' bodies were miraculously preserved). In 1918 there were even calls to outlaw the sacrament of the Eucharist on account of its miraculous transformation as believed by Orthodox and Catholic Christians. The body of St Sergius of Radonezh was exposed as fraudulent and the Soviet media eagerly spread this news that there was nothing but rotten bones and dust in his shrine. Revolution and the Church wrote: \\"Believers no longer weep, don't fall into fits of hysteria, and don't hold a grudge against the Soviet government anymore. They see there has been no blasphemy‚Ä¶ Only an age-old fraud has been made naked in the eyes of the nation.\\"Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti- Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988). p. 19 From the St Sergius-Trinity Monastery where these relics came from, an entirely different story was circulated that when the relics were exposed it was found that the saint's body was in excellent condition (he had lived in the 14th century), and when the crowd of believers that had come there saw this they fell on their knees in prayer, while the Bolshevik commander was pulled off his horse and beaten by the crowd. A similar event occurred in the city of Vladimir when the relics of two saints were exposed and the doctor who had acted as medical state witness reconfirmed his faith according to his own testimony.Dimitry V.

The exposure of Tikhon of Zadonsk and some Novgorodian saints were examples of this. The anti-religious press after such instances would declare that the church had been deceiving the nation. Bishop Alexii of Novgorod later declared, however, that the church did not teach that the saints must necessarily be immune to decay or that non-corruption of the body was proof of sainthood. Stories of supernatural manifestations in the families of fanatical communists where some members were practicing Christian were allegedly common in the early post-1917 years.Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti- Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988). p. 21 The most common of such miracles reported were sudden renovations of family icons that had gone dark over years would suddenly shine with fresh colours as though newly painted before the eyes of the communist. Some of the communists converted back to the Church after such events. The Soviet propaganda countered these claims by claiming that they were tricks created by priests and kulaks to dupe people. The Sretenskaia church at the Sennoi marketplace in Kiev had two gold-plated domes that had for been completely tarnished after many years. These domes experienced a similar renovations one day when light shone so brightly from the domes that it was at first thought to be on fire, and a huge crowd gathered to see it with an atmosphere of religious euphoria. The light reportedly moved in patches around the dome for three days as they were progressively \\"renovated\\". The local communist newspaper then printed two articles, one of them signed by members of the Academy of Sciences, which stated that the phenomenon was caused by a rare air wave containing a peculiar electric discharge. A witness claimed it later became known that the GPU had forced the Academy to say this, and that there were other gold-plated things in the area that were not similarly renovated.Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988). pp. 21-22 Several months later the church was dynamited. A similar event occurred at the church of the Holy Jordan, also in Kiev, which was also dynamited soon afterward. One of the most famous of these supposed miracles occurred in the village of Kalinovka near Vinnitsa in the Ukraine. A detachment of mounted police had come to the village in order to close the local church, but they were met by hostile crowds. The crowds were too big for the police to force their way through and so they retreated. Not far from the church, however, there was a traditional Crucifix standing at a crossroads, and the policemen in frustration fired at the crucifix. One of the bullets hit the crucifix in Christ's side and suddenly blood gushed out of the hole reportedly. One of the policemen lost control of himself and fell off his horse, while the others took off. The crowd went on its knees and prayed in front of the bleeding crucifix. The news spread and thousands of people came to see it. The blood reportedly kept running out for several days. Soon after more police came with orders to hack down the crucifix but each time they returned in failure under the claim that some force was preventing them from approaching it. The local communist press tried to explain the phenomena by claiming that there had been an accumulation of water in the wooden cross behind the metallic figure, and that once the bullet hit the metal, the water, which had turned red from the metal's rust, must have seeped through. The crowds brought crosses with them that they set up beside it, prayed before it and dipped cloths in the miraculous blood. For days and nights they sang hymns as well as burned candles. Priests were absent in fear. Many atheists reportedly converted after seeing this.Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti- Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988). pp. 22-23 At the very first opportunity the Soviets destroyed the bleeding Crucifix and all adjacent crosses. It was later claimed that a commission of experts had reported that the fluid coming out of the bullet hole was not blood. The people who had gathered there that day were later depicted as drunkards, fools and scum, and it was claimed that the kissing of the Crucifix had resulted in an outbreak of syphilis as well as mass robberies.Dimitry V.

In order to intensify the anti-religious propaganda in the school system, the Chief Administration for Political Enlightenment (Glavpolitprosvet) was established in November 1920.Sabrina Petra Ramet, Ed., Religious Policy in the Soviet Union.

The church was only willing to remarry those who conformed to church canons (from Jesus' sermon on the mount when He declares it wrong to divorce and remarry except on grounds of unchastity). This situation was solved in May 1920 when the Patriarch relegated all formal marriage and divorce proceedings to the civil authorities.Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 2: Soviet Anti-Religious Campaigns and Persecutions, St Martin's Press, New York (1988). pp. 12-13 In Kharkov it was forbidden for the clergy to baptize, wed or bury anyone without the permission of the local Soviet Executive Committee. This meant that infants died unbaptized and corpses decayed until relatives could get permission to bury them in church. In the South-Eastern Ukraine the local authorities forced the Jews to perform communal work on Saturdays. In the city of Lugansk a synagogue was turned into a public bath. Such attacks on other religions were not as widespread, however, and were more likely given at the command of local authorities then from the central government. Prior to the revolution, Lenin had accepted believers into the ranks of the Bolshevik party, so long as they worked towards the party goals. This was because the initial conquest of power was a higher priority than the dissemination of atheism.Kolarz, Walter. Religion in the Soviet Union. St Martin's Press, New York (1961) p. 4 After the Bolsheviks took power, old party members who were believers received some tolerance in exceptional cases initially.Kolarz, Walter. Religion in the Soviet Union. St Martin's Press, New York (1961), p. 4 Yaroslavsky in later years recalled an episode wherein an old party member wrote on the top of a questionnaire: 'In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. It was originally believed in the ideology that religion would disappear quickly with the coming of the revolution and that its replacement with atheism would be inevitable.Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, The Attitude of the Workers' Party to Religion.

Paul Dixon, Religion in the Soviet Union, first published 1945 in Workers International News, and can be found at: http://www.marxist.com/religion- soviet-union170406.htm The article would be very important in anti-religious policy in the USSR in later years, and its last sentence, which would be both ignored and recalled back at different point in Soviet history, would play an important role in later rivalries in the power struggles of later years between different Soviet leaders. Anti-monastic campaign The state took a particular hard-line against monasticism in the Orthodox church, which it saw as being a critical institution for the spiritual life of the church especially through their function as centres of pilgrimage. The prestige they had, as well as the possibility of their use to co-ordinate resistance, also provoked the state. A widespread campaign to liquidate monasteries was undertaken with much brutality and many monks and monastic believers were killed. By 1921 the number of liquidated monasteries and convents rose to 573. They were liquidated on the basis that they were parasitic communities. The Patriarch in response turned monasteries into working communes on the model of voluntary Orthodox Christian agrarian communes (in existence pre-1917). The regime responded to this move by accusing the Church of trying to create its own state and economy, and forbade it from doing this. Anti-religious propaganda Atheistic propaganda was considered to be of essential importance to Lenin's party from its early pre-revolutionary daysVladimir Ilyich Lenin, The Attitude of the Workers' Party to Religion. Proletary, No. 45, May 13 (26), 1909. Found at: http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1909/may/13.htm and the regime was quick to create atheist journals to attack religion shortly after its coming to power. The first operated under the name Revolution and the Church (Revolustiia i tserkov) published by the People's Commissariat for Justice. This publication in its earliest editions attacked the Orthodox church as a fraud and tried to sow division by singling out the Orthodox for attack, while presenting Protestants and Muslims as supportive of the state. Public debates were held between Christians and atheists after the revolution up until they were suspended in 1929. Among famous participants of these debates included on the atheist side, Commissar for Enlightenment Anatoly Lunacharsky. People would line up for hours in order to get seats to see them. The authorities sometimes tried to limit the speaking time of the Christians to ten minutes, and on other occasions the debates would be called off at last minute. Professor V.S. Martsinkovsky, raised as orthodox but who had become an evangelical Protestant was one of the best on the religious side, and Lunacharsky reportedly canceled one of his debates with him after having lost in a previous debate.Dimitry V. Pospielovsky. A History of Soviet Atheism in Theory, and Practice, and the Believer, vol 1: A History of Marxist-Leninist Atheism and Soviet Anti-Religious Policies, St Martin's Press, New York (1987) p. 39 On one occasion in 1921 a large crowd of Komsomol hecklers arrived at one of Martsinkovsky's debates and occupied the two front rows. When the leader tried to heckle, he found himself unsupported by his boys, and afterwards they told the Komsomol leader that he hadn't said what they were told he was going to say. Controversy During the Second World War Nazi collaborator Metropolitan Sergii of Vilnius, an Orthodox bishop described the Bolshevik actions in regard to the Orthodox church as demonstrating the \\"utmost cruelty\\" and claimed that Orthodox Christians were persecuted for their belief, rather than because the Boilsheviks saw the church as a counter- revolutionary focal point for opposition to their regime.

Streett served as aide to air power advocate General Billy Mitchell, and was viewed by General of the Air Force Henry H. Arnold as his own personal \\"troubleshooter\\". Earlier in his career, Streett served in France during the last stages of World War I. In 1920, he was awarded the Mackay Trophy and the Distinguished Flying Cross for leading a squadron of U.S. airmen on a pioneering air voyage from New York City to Nome, Alaska and back. Streett wrote of his squadron's difficulties in an article for National Geographic. Streett assisted Mitchell during the famous bombing demonstration against battleships. After participating in several air races, he made an exploratory flight to extreme altitude during which he experienced frozen flight controls, and then wrote a story about the adventure for Popular Science. During World War II, Streett commanded various training units in Hawaii, Florida and Colorado, solving logistical, training, and personnel problems. In Washington, D.C., he led the Theater Group of the Operations Division in the Office of the Chief of Staff where he expressed grave misgivings about the role of General Douglas MacArthur in the Pacific War‚Äîsome two years later Streett was sent to the South West Pacific Area to work under MacArthur commanding the Thirteenth Air Force during its first offensive drive. With victory certain, Streett returned to the United States to organize for Arnold the Continental Air Forces (CAF), and then to expand its operation across the country. Streett retained command when the CAF turned into the SAC, and continued to experience friction with MacArthur. After retiring from the United States Air Force in 1952, Streett was named to the Sarnoff Commission, a presidential formation tasked with trimming unnecessary military spending.

By 1916, he was a sergeant in the Signal Corps, Enlisted Reserve., This is after the start of the World War I in Europe 1914-1918 and before America's entry into the war. In December 1916, Streett signed up as an aviation cadet and was trained at the Curtis School at Newport News, Virginia and at Wright Field in Ohio. America entered the world war in April 1917. On September 27, 1917, St. Clair Streett was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Signal Officers' Reserve Corps. In December 1917, Streett was posted to Issoudun, France, as an air training instructor. The majority of the United States Army troops and pilots would arrive later, in 1918. He was then assigned to the 5th Pursuit Group operating out of Lay-Saint-Remy Aerodrome, France. Later, after the Allied victory in November 1918, he served in Germany with the American occupation forces, and returned to the United States in August 1919.

When Mitchell formed the 1st Provisional Air Brigade in May 1921 for the purpose of demonstrating that a bomber could sink a battleship, Streett was closely connected. Mitchell sent Streett to Air Corps headquarters to inform his superior Charles T. Menoher that the battleships could not be sunk as planned, with the bombers flying at .

Mitchell also planned to sink the target ship with several very close near-miss explosions that would cause severe damage to the ship's hull below the waterline. The US Navy's rules for the bombing limited the actual number of direct hits allowed on the target ship. The US Navy had intended to inspect the damage to these ships after the bombings, and US Navy gunfire to learn as much as possible about the effects of shell & bomb hits on battleship armor and structure. The target ship, the former German World War I battleship Ostfriesland was sunk with only a few direct hits, and several intentional very near-misses. The US Navy leadership was shocked and angry over the target's sinking. In late July after the battleship Ostfriesland had been sunk, Mitchell carried out a 19-bomber mock raid against Manhattan. About the stunt, Streett wrote an article entitled \\"14th Heavy Bombardment Squadron Attacks New York City\\" for the Army and Navy aviation magazine U.S. Air Service. During this time, Streett wrote an article about the Alaskan venture entitled \\"The First Alaskan Air Expedition\\" for the National Geographic magazine, with the issue appearing in May 1922.

World War II Col. St. Clair Streett (at left) with Gen. Eisenhower in War Plans Division meeting, March 1942 In March 1942, Streett became chief of the Theater Group of the Operations Division in the Office of the Chief of Staff. When United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Chief of Staff Henry H. \\"Hap\\" Arnold proposed to George Marshall in October 1942 that an Army man be named supreme commander for the whole Allied effort in the Pacific, suggesting Douglas MacArthur, Lesley McNair or airman Joseph T. McNarney for the position, Marshall without comment passed the request to his staff for analysis. There, Albert Wedemeyer and Streett examined the problem. Wedemeyer, an Army officer, thought the supreme commander should be an airman; either Arnold or McNarney. Streett, too, was in favor of one supreme commander but he recognized the political challenges‚Äîhe projected that the president would have to make the appointment, not a committee of military men prone to interservice rivalry. For supreme commander in the Pacific, Streett suggested McNarney or Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, depending on whether an air or a naval strategy was considered most important. About MacArthur, Streett wrote that \\"[a]t the risk of being considered naive and just plain country-boy dumb,\\"Morton, 1961 he thought that MacArthur would have to be removed from the Pacific in order for there to be any sound cooperation in the theater. Streett suggested MacArthur be appointed ambassador to \\"Russia\\" or some similar position of high stature but low military influence. Of this analysis work, nothing was enacted; Marshall did not bring the problem and its suggested solutions to either the Navy or the president. Tampa In November 1942, Arnold assigned Streett to take charge of the Third Air Force, a medium bomber training command based at Tampa, Florida. The unit had seen enough B-26 Marauder training accidents that grim-humored airmen coined the phrase \\"one a day in Tampa Bay.\\" (The oft- repeated line was an exaggeration; ignoring crashes into land, 13 Marauders ditched in Tampa Bay in the 14 months between the first one on August 5, 1942 and the final one on October 8, 1943.Scutts, Jerry.

Osprey Publishing. ) Streett implemented a tightening of training policy to reduce losses through human error, and he initiated research into solutions for the technical problems the bomber was having. At the time, Tampa was rated the worst U.S. city for syphilis infections among USAAF personnel, and the city with the most rampant prostitution. USAAF Captain Robert Dyer, charged with protecting the country's airmen from venereal disease (VD), had no success getting Tampa authorities to address the problem.Thompson, Troy.

When Streett arrived at his command and saw the extent of the VD crisis at MacDill Field, he threatened to close certain areas of Tampa to all military personnel if the city's police were unable to curb prostitution. This action would have ruined a number of legitimate local businesses, and a campaign was initiated to arrest prostitutes and to bar unmarried couples from renting a room together. Police arrests, however, were limited to misdemeanor charges of vagrancy or loitering‚Äîthere were no state or local laws specific to prostitution. In response to complaints from Streett and other military leaders, in January 1943 Florida's Department of Health mounted a statewide media blitz encouraging testing and treatment for VD. Later that year, the state passed a law giving police wide latitude to arrest prostitutes for hire and also unmarried persons participating in \\"licentious sexual intercourse without hire.\\" Heavy bombers In September 1943, Streett assumed command of the Second Air Force at Peterson Field, Colorado Springs, Colorado, training heavy bomber crews to fly the B-24 Liberator. In January 1944, he was assigned to the Southwest Pacific Area and assumed command of the Thirteenth Air Force when it was consolidated into an offensive stance in June. Streett served under George Kenney, who was the USAAF theater commander subordinate to MacArthur. At the end of September and in early October, Streett mounted a series of round trip air raids by heavy bombers flying from Hollandia, New Guinea to attack Balikpapan, a major center of Japanese petroleum processing and storage. In U.S. media reports, the raids were compared to the Ploesti raids of 1943, with strong Japanese resistance on the second raid said to be responsible for downing seven B-24s‚Äîa loss of 70 aircrew.Time, October 16, 1944. \\"World Battlefronts: Another Ploesti.\\" Retrieved on January 3, 2010.

In effect, Streett was left in charge of CAF. In November 1945, Streett proposed a reorganization of United States air power into separate commands: Eastern and Western air defense commands, a tactical air support command and a training command.

He revealed to the students that the SAC was not yet very powerful‚Äîonly two strike groups were fully operational and that three months in the future after a rush of preparation, there still would be only four B-29 Superfortress groups and two long-range fighter aircraft groups. This was in contrast to the then-current public relations statements by the SAC which proclaimed \\"quick retaliation will be our answer [to any future aggressor] in the form of an aerial knockout...\\" Streett described how General MacArthur, Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Far East Command, refused to release to SAC the control of one very heavy bombardment group and one very long-range reconnaissance group of the Twentieth Air Force.Futrell, 1989, pp. 223, 266. Streett offered his opinion that the SAC should stage into the Far East and take operational control of those units. In January 1947, Streett was assigned to the adjutant general's office as chief of the Military Personnel Procurement Service. He was appointed the air inspector in the newly established Office of the Inspector General in January 1948, and two months later became deputy inspector general. Streett was named deputy commander of Air Materiel Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, in October 1949. In December 1951, he became special assistant to the commanding general of Air Materiel Command. Streett retired from the USAF in February 1952 with the rank of Major General, having flown numerous aircraft from early biplanes to the early jets. In October 1952, Streett was named to the Citizens Advisory Commission on Manpower Utilization in the Armed Services, popularly known as the Sarnoff Commission for its chairman Brigadier General David Sarnoff, the long-serving chairman of RCA. Defense Secretary Robert A. Lovett established the commission for the purpose of identifying and eliminating excess military spending without reducing combat effectiveness.UP, New York. The Bulletin, November 24, 1952. \\"Salt Lake Man Next Secretary of Agriculture.\\" Retrieved on January 3, 2010. Robert Wood Johnson II, chairman of Johnson & Johnson, resigned from the commission because of the strain it took on his health, but he noted that the USAF represented by Commissioner Streett was \\"cooperative and open to greater progress\\" with the commission, directly contrasting with the U.S. Navy which he rated as \\"militantly resistant.\\"Time, March 2, 1953. \\"National Affairs: A Matter of Life & Death\\" Retrieved on January 3, 2010. The Sarnoff Commission's 85-page report was delivered to the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services and Charles Erwin Wilson, President Dwight D. Eisenhower's new defense secretary, on February 17, 1953. It called for a ten percent reduction in military spending, amounting to the elimination of 500,000 civilian and military personnel and the cutting of $5B from the military's annual budget.Clarfield, Gerard H. (1999) Security with solvency: Dwight D. Eisenhower and the shaping of the American military establishment, pp. 98, 116. Greenwood Publishing Group. After studying the report, Wilson appointed a commission to heed its main points and streamline the Defense Department so that it could more efficiently wage a war. Instead of Streett, Wilson selected retired General Spaatz to represent the USAF.

He studied at the University of Melbourne and then at King's College, Cambridge. Biography After studying economics at the University of Melbourne he moved to the University of Cambridge, where he received his doctorate. In 1958 he moved to the University of Adelaide as a lecturer and was appointed to a chair in Economics at Adelaide in 1967. (He was a University Lecturer at Cambridge and a Fellow of Trinity Hall 1964‚Äì66, on leave without pay from Adelaide). He was a University Lecturer (1982‚Äì90) and Reader (1990‚Äì98) in the Faculty of Economics at Cambridge and a Fellow and College Lecturer in Economics, Jesus College, Cambridge, 1982‚Äì98, and was President of Jesus College Cambridge, 1988‚Äì89 and 1990‚Äì92. He has made major contributions to the understanding of the ideas of Keynes, Joan Robinson and other Cambridge economists. He has also made important contributions in his own right to post-Keynesian and post- Kaleckian theory. A review article of one of his volumes of 'Selected Essays' argues that (i) insofar as he has written on capital theory, it has been as an innovator and not as a mere raconteur, and (ii) that he has developed his own suite of post-Keynesian models ‚Äì this is evident, for example, in his 1965 paper ‚ÄúA two-sector model of the distribution of income and the level of employment in the short-run‚Äù which is reprinted in The Social Science Imperialists: Selected Essays of G.C.

It is drifting away with a radial velocity of +29.5 km/s, having come to within around a million years ago. Kazanasmas (1973) found a stellar classification of G5IV for this object, matching a G-type star that is evolving along the subgiant branch. It was later given a class of G8V, suggesting it is instead a G-type main-sequence star. This object is nearly twelve billion years old and is spinning slowly with a projected rotational velocity of 1.4 km/s. The star has 86% of the mass of the Sun and 95% of the Sun's radius. It is radiating 75% of the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 5,525 K. The metallicity is sub-solar, meaning it has a lower abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium compared to the Sun. In 2009, a gas giant planet was found in orbit around the star.

He was Recorder of Grampound, of Tregony, and of St Ives, Cornwall. The Hawkins family Christopher Hawkins was the second son of Thomas Hawkins of Trewithen, a considerable landowner and former MP for Grampound. Thomas Hawkins had a lifelong fear of smallpox and died following an inoculation to prevent it. Christopher's elder brother John was drowned in the River Thames whilst at Eton, whilst a younger brother Thomas died \\"of a fever in consequence of eating an ice-cream after dancing.\\"R. Polwhele, The History of Cornwall Vol 5, p.122 & Vol. 7, p.93 (1816) His youngest brother, John Hawkins, survived and became a noted geologist. On his father's death in 1766, Christopher inherited his estates. Career as MP Hawkins was appointed High Sheriff of Cornwall for 1783.Complete Baronetage He then followed in his father's footsteps by becoming a member of parliament at the age of 26. He subsequently earned notoriety as the leading commoner engaged in 'boroughmongering', the purchase and sale of rotten boroughs, parliamentary constituencies that had very few electors and as a result could be bought and sold through patronage, influence, and straightforward bribery. At his peak, Hawkins wholly or partly controlled six such boroughs, each returning two MPs, giving him the ability to ensure the successful election of candidates in return for cash or favours. He normally reserved these seats for government (Tory party) supporters.R. G. Thorne, The House of Commons 1790‚Äì1820, Vol. 3, 1986 He himself was MP for several of his own Cornish boroughs, namely Grampound from 1800 to 1807, Mitchell from 1784 to 1799 and again from 1806 to 1807, Penryn from 1806 to 1807 and again from 1818 to 1820, and St Ives from 1821 to 1828. His appearances in the chamber of the house were not memorable. He appears to have spoken just four times: once very briefly in 1807, when charged with bribery he left \\"his case entirely to the justice and liberality of the house\\", twice in 1819 with regard to the Penryn Bribery Bill, when, according to Hansard, he was on both occasions \\"quite inaudible\\", and once in 1827 when he was \\"totally inaudible\\".  Later Scandal  Following the 1806 Penryn election, Hawkins was found guilty of bribery by a parliamentary committee and dispossessed of his seat, but unusually was not barred from the House. Since he had also been elected MP for Grampound and for Mitchell, he remained in the House of Commons, albeit under considerable censure. The Attorney General had been asked to take up the charge and Hawkins was sent for trial at Bodmin Assize Court in 1808, but was there acquitted. The political reformer William Cobbett attended and reported on the trial, and was less than impressed by its outcome.Cobbett's Weekly Political Register Vol 14(9), 1808 In 1810, the bribery charge and ensuing bad feeling led to Hawkins fighting a duel with his fellow boroughmonger and former Whig MP for Penryn Lord Dunstanville. Neither party was injured. Hawkins earned himself a reputation as a miser and it was claimed that, to reduce election expenses, he pulled down the houses of electors on his land thus depriving them of the right to vote. In this way, he was said to have reduced the number of electors at Mitchell to three.  Father of the House  For his loyal service to the Tory government, he was created a baronet in 1791 by William Pitt the Younger and by the time of his death had become Father of the House.Obituary, Gentleman's Magazine Vol. 99(1), p. 564, 1829 Land and mine-owner Sir Christopher inherited considerable estates from his father, but assiduously purchased additional land, eventually claiming that he could \\"ride from one side of Cornwall to the other without setting hoof on another man's soil.\\" He bought well over a dozen manors, many of them ‚Äì such as the manors of Grampound, of Mitchell, and of St Ives ‚Äì to gain possession of rotten boroughs.F. Hitchins & S. Drew, The History of Cornwall, vol. 2 (1824) He acquired the manors of Cargoll and of Trelundra to further his interests in Mitchell, but whilst attempting to improve some wasteland in Cargoll by deep- ploughing, lead ore was discovered. Sir Christopher set up the Old Shepherds Mine to exploit the lead and found additional silver, making the mine a considerable source of profit before it closed in 1820.D. Gilbert, The parochial history of Cornwall, Vol. 3, pp 271‚Äì273 (1838) In 1818 he opened a copper and tin mine at St Ives, later known as St Ives Consols. At his stream works at Ladock, near Grampound, gold was found as well as tin. A specimen of Ladock gold was presented to the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall by Sir Christopher, who also published observations on the find in their Transactions.J. Calvert (1853) The Gold Rocks of Great Britain & Ireland, p. 86 Sir Christopher was a partner in the Cornish Copper Company which established a smelting works at Copperhouse, built a canal to Hayle and extended the harbour there to export metal and import coal, timber, and other goods. He owned china clay mines in the St Austell area and substantially rebuilt the harbour at Pentewan to serve as a china clay port, connected to St Austell by the Pentewan Railway, a horse-drawn tramway. Sir Christopher obtained the post of Vice Lord Warden of the Stannaries, giving him considerable influence and control over mines and mining in Cornwall. Trewithen House and gardens Trewithen House The family home of Trewithen, near Probus, was purchased by Philip Hawkins of Trewinnard in 1715 and substantially and grandly rebuilt. His nephew, Sir Christopher's father, inherited the house in 1738 and was responsible for much of its landscaping. Sir Christopher, known locally as \\"Sir Kit\\", extended the grounds but added little to the house, reinforcing his reputation as a miser among his local tenants. The following verse was said to have been fixed to the gates of Trewithen: :A large house, and no cheer, :A large park, and no deer, :A large cellar, and no beer, :Sir Christopher Hawkins lives here. Trewithen House, now a Grade I listed building, is still privately owned by a family descendant. It houses a portrait of Sir Christopher and is open to the public. The dairy farm at Trewithen supplies milk for the production of the ice cream made by Kelly's of Cornwall in Bodmin. thumb The garden at Trewithen was made by G. H. Johnstone VMH; it covers about 23 acres and is noted for its design and for the large collection of camellias, magnolias and rhododendrons.Synge, Patrick M. (1977) The Gardens of Britain; Vol. 1: Devon and Cornwall. London: B. T. Batsford in assoc. with Royal Horticultural Society ; pp. 142-45 Patron of steam, horticulture, and antiquarian pursuits Sir Christopher was a Fellow of the Royal Society, of what was to become the Royal Horticultural Society, and of the Antiquarian Society. He was also a life subscriber to the Royal Institution.Prospectus...of the Royal Institution, p. 73, 1800 In 1811 he published a short book entitled Observations on the Tin Trade of the Ancients in Cornwall, concerning his theories on the involvement of the Phoenicians in the mining and trading of Cornish tin.Hawkins, Sir C. (1811) Observations on the Tin Trade of the Ancients in Cornwall and on the \\"Ictis\\" of Diodorus Siculus, 80 pp. Sir Christopher was a patron and supporter of the Cornish steam pioneer Richard Trevithick and in 1812 commissioned from him the world's first steam threshing machine, powered by a \\"semi-portable\\" barn engine. The machine continued in use till the 1880s and has been preserved by the Science Museum in London. In 1813, he brought the Cornish Gillyflower apple, found in a cottage garden in Truro, to the attention of the Royal Horticultural Society who awarded him a silver medal \\"for his exertions\\".The Gardener's Magazine; Vol. 6, p. 575, 1830 The apple is still grown today and is commercially available. Sir Christopher never married. On his death, his estate passed to his youngest brother, John, and then to his nephew, Christopher Henry Thomas Hawkins. In fiction He is a recurring character in the Poldark novels by Winston Graham, where he is depicted as a corrupt and cynical boroughmonger, but generous to his friends.

Malta had been captured by a French expeditionary force during the Mediterranean campaign of 1798, and garrisoned with 3,000 men under the command of Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois. After the British Royal Navy destroyed the French Mediterranean Fleet at the Battle of the Nile on 1 August 1798, the British were able to initiate a blockade of Malta, assisted by an uprising among the native Maltese population against French rule. After its retreat to Valletta, the French garrison faced severe food shortages, exacerbated by the effectiveness of the British blockade. Although small quantities of supplies arrived in early 1799, there was no further traffic until early 1800, by which time starvation and disease was having a disastrous effect on health, morale, and combat capability of the French troops. In February 1800, a significant convoy under Contre-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Perr√©e sent from Toulon made a determined effort to resupply the garrison. The blockade squadron under Rear-Admiral Lord Nelson intercepted the convoy within sight of the starving troops on Malta. Perr√©e was killed and his flagship captured in the ensuing and brief Battle of the Malta Convoy (1800); no supplies reached Malta. The following month, the ship of the line Guillaume Tell set sail from Valletta to Toulon, laden with soldiers, but this too was intercepted and in a hard-fought battle was forced to surrender to a larger British squadron. These defeats rendered the French position on Valletta untenable, and its surrender inevitable. Although Vaubois held out for another five months, he eventually surrendered on 4 September and Malta was taken by Britain. French invasion of Malta Napoleon landing in Malta, June 1798 On 19 May 1798, a French fleet sailed from Toulon, escorting an expeditionary force of over 30,000 men under General Napoleon Bonaparte. The force was destined for Egypt, Bonaparte seeking to expand French influence in Asia and force Britain to make peace in the French Revolutionary Wars, which had begun in 1792.Cole, p. 13 Sailing southeast, the convoy collected additional transports from Italian ports and at 05:30 on 9 June arrived off Valletta, the heavily fortified port-city on the island of Malta.James, Vol. 2, p. 151 At this time, Malta and its neighbouring islands were ruled by the Knights of St. John, an old and influential feudal order weakened by the loss of most of their revenue during the French Revolution. The order was composed of men from across Europe, including a significant proportion of Frenchmen, who ruled over the majority Maltese population of the islands.Cole, p. 10 The head of government was Grand Master Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim, who refused Bonaparte's demand that his entire convoy be allowed to enter Valletta and take on supplies, insisting that Malta's neutrality meant that only two ships could enter at a time.Cole, p. 8 Capitulation of Malta to general Bonaparte On receiving this reply, Bonaparte immediately ordered his fleet to bombard Valletta and on 11 June General Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers directed an amphibious operation in which several thousand soldiers landed at seven strategic sites around the island. The French Knights deserted the order, and the remaining Knights failed to mount a meaningful resistance. Approximately 2,000 native Maltese militia resisted for 24 hours, retreating to Valletta once the city of Mdina fell to General Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois.Cole, p. 9 Although Valletta was strong enough to hold out against a lengthy siege, Bonaparte negotiated a surrender with Hompesch, who agreed to turn Malta and all of its resources over to the French in exchange for estates and pensions in France for himself and his knights.Gardiner, p. 21 Bonaparte then established a French garrison on the islands, leaving 4,000 men under Vaubois while he and the rest of the expeditionary force sailed eastwards for Alexandria on 19 June.Adkins, p. 13 Battle of the Nile Bonaparte's convoy was pursued across the Mediterranean by a British fleet of 14 ships under Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson, who learned of the invasion of Malta while anchored off Sicily, and subsequently attempted to intercept the French on their passage to Egypt. Nelson's force overtook the French fleet on the night of 22 June in the dark without discovering their presence, and arrived off Alexandria on 28 June ahead of Bonaparte.Mostert, p. 254 Believing that the French must have had a different objective, Nelson turned northwards the following day to investigate the coast of Anatolia and missed Bonaparte's arrival on 30 June by less than 24 hours.Bradford, p. 187 Unopposed, Bonaparte landed his army and marched on Alexandria, capturing the city and turning inland. The fleet was ordered to anchor in nearby Aboukir Bay and await further instructions.James, Vol. 2, p. 159 On 1 August, Nelson returned to the Egyptian coast and discovered the French fleet at anchor. Attacking immediately, Nelson's ships managed to capture nine French ships of the line and destroy two, including the flagship Orient with only moderate damage to themselves.Mostert, p. 272 The destruction of the French Mediterranean fleet granted control of the sea to the Royal Navy, soon joined by the navies of Portugal, Naples, the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire as part of the hastily organised Second Coalition against France.Gardiner, p. 58 Maltese uprising Canon Francesco Saverio Caruana, one of the Maltese insurgent leaders. He later became Bishop of Malta. On Malta, the French had rapidly dismantled the institutions of the Knights of St. John, including the Roman Catholic Church. Church property was looted and seized to pay for the expedition to Egypt, an act that generated considerable anger among the deeply religious Maltese population. On 2 September, this anger erupted in a popular uprising during an auction of church property, and within days thousands of Maltese irregulars had driven the French garrison into Valletta.Gardiner, p. 67 Valletta was surrounded by approximately 10,000 irregular Maltese soldiers led by Emmanuele Vitale and Canon Francesco Saverio Caruana. The Maltese were armed with 23 cannon and a small squadron of coastal gunboats. Although there was intermittent skirmishing between the garrison and the Maltese, the fortress was too strong for the irregulars to assault. In mid-September, a squadron of Portuguese ships had arrived at the island. They included the Pr√≠ncipe Real (90 cannons; Captain Puysigur), Rainha de Portugal (74; Captain Thomas Stone), S√£o Sebasti√£o (74; Captain Mitchell), Afonso de Albuquerque (74; Captain Donald Campbell), and the brig Falc√£o (24; Captain Duncan). All were under the command of Domingos Xavier de Lima, Marquess of Niza. In addition, the British ship (Captain Manley Dixon) and the fireship (Captain George Baker) were attached to the squadron. The Portuguese government had sent this force from the Tagus to augment Nelson's fleet. After a brief stay off Malta the squadron continued to Alexandria. There Nelson sent the squadron back to blockade Malta.Clowes, p. 376. Late in September, a British convoy consisting of 13 battered ships under Captain Sir James Saumarez appeared off the island. Survivors of the Battle of the Nile, they were in urgent need of repair and unable to directly assist in the siege.James, Vol. 2, p. 188 Nevertheless, Saumarez met with representatives of the Maltese and on 25 September, sent an offer of truce to Vaubois on their behalf. Vaubois replied \\"Vous avez, sans doute, oubli√© que des Fran√ßais sont dans la place. Le sort des habitans [sic] ne vous regarde pointe. Quant √† votre sommation, les soldats fran√ßais ne sont point habitu√©s √† ce style\\" (\\"You might have forgotten that the French hold this place. The fate of the inhabitants is none of your concern. As for your ultimatum, French soldiers are not accustomed to such a tone\\"). Unable to persuade the French to give in, Saumarez instead provided the Maltese forces with 1,200 muskets with which to continue the siegeClowes, p. 374 and, unable to delay repairs any longer, sailed for Gibraltar at the end of the month. On 12 October, the British ships of the line HMS Alexander under Captain Alexander Ball, HMS Culloden under Captain Thomas Troubridge and HMS Colossus under Captain George Murray joined Niza's ships off Malta, marking the formal start of the blockade.James, Vol. 2, p. 189 On the same day, Vaubois withdrew the last of his soldiers into the fortified new city of Valletta, accompanied by approximately 100 Maltese nationals who had joined the French forces. The garrison numbered over 3,000 men and initially at least was well supplied. In the harbour lay the ships of the line D√©go and Ath√©nien and the frigate Carthaginoise, all of which were former ships of the Maltese Navy, as well as the newly arrived Guillaume Tell and frigates Justice and Diane, survivors of the Battle of the Nile under Rear-Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve, which had reached Malta at the end of September. Capture of Gozo On 24 October, after a ten-day passage from Naples,Bradford, p. 222 Nelson joined the blockade squadron in HMS Vanguard accompanied by HMS Minotaur. On 28 October, Ball successfully completed negotiations with the French garrison on the small island of Gozo, the 217 French soldiers there agreeing to surrender without a fight and transferring the island, its fortifications, 24 cannon, a large quantity of ammunition and 3,200 sacks of flour to the British. Although the island was formally claimed by King Ferdinand of Naples, it was administered by British and Maltese representatives, whose first action was to distribute the captured food supplies to the island's 16,000 inhabitants. Malta and the surrounding islands were not self-sufficient and quickly the challenge of feeding the population became a strain on the islands' resources, particularly with so many men under arms, Although now formally in command of the islands, King Ferdinand refused to assist with supplies, and the responsibility was left to Ball and his captains to arrange for the transport of supplies from Italy. By the end of the year, the number of Maltese troops in the field had fallen from 10,000 to 1,500, supported by 500 British and Portuguese marines from the blockade squadron. The blockade fleet, consisting of five British and four Portuguese ships, operated from St. Paul's Bay and Marsa Sirocco (now Marsaxlokk) on the island of Malta itself. Blockade Casa Leoni, the command base for the Maltese insurgents Map of Tal-Borg Battery, one of the batteries built by the Maltese to bombard French positions and repel any counterattack 1799 was a frustrating year for the British and Maltese forces deployed against Malta, as efforts to secure sufficient forces to prosecute the siege were repeatedly denied. Major-General James St Clair-Erskine, commander of British Army forces in the Mediterranean, considered the ongoing War of the Second Coalition in Italy and the defence of Menorca to be higher priorities than Ball's siege, while the defeated Neapolitans continued to refuse assistance. A Russian squadron under Admiral Fyodor Fyodorovich Ushakov briefly appeared off the island in January, but was almost immediately ordered to join the Russian and Turkish forces besieging the island of Corfu.Gardiner, p. 68 In addition to the difficulties the Allies faced in obtaining food for the Maltese population, the French succeeded in bringing supplies through the blockade in the early part of the year: in January 1799 a schooner reached Valletta from Ancona, and in February the frigate Boudeuse evaded the blockade and entered the port with supplies from Toulon. In May, a major French expedition under Admiral Etienne Eustache Bruix entered the Western Mediterranean, forcing Nelson to recall his scattered fleet from across the region, temporarily raising the blockade of Malta.Clowes, p. 390 During this operation a number of French supply ships took advantage of the absence of the British squadron to enter Valletta. However, despite these occasional supply ships, the French garrison was rapidly running out of food. To conserve resources, the French forced the civilian population out of the city; the civilian population dropped from 45,000 in 1799 to 9,000 by 1800. Nelson himself took nominal command of the blockade, while Ball was made president of the Maltese National Congress. As liaison between the Maltese military and civilian commanders, he directed the distribution of supplies to the Maltese population, which was beginning to suffer from disease brought about by food shortages. He was replaced on Alexander by his first lieutenant, William Harrington. On 1 November Nelson again offered terms of surrender to Vaubois, and was again rebuffed, with the reply \\"Jaloux de m√©riter l'estime de votre nation, comme vous recherchez celle de la n√¥tre, nous sommes r√©solus d√©fendre cette fortresse jusqu'√† l'extr√©mit√©\\" (\\"Keen to deserve the esteem of your nation, as you seek that of ours, we are resolved to defend this fortress until the end\\"). By this point, Nelson was conducting the blockade at a distance, based at the Neapolitan court in Palermo. There he indulged in gambling and social engagements, becoming closer and closer to Emma, Lady Hamilton, wife of the ambassador Sir William Hamilton. His behaviour was heavily criticised, not just by his commanding officer Vice-Admiral Lord Keith, who had recently replaced Earl St Vincent, but also by old friends such as Thomas Troubridge, who wrote to him \\"If you knew what your friends feel for you I am sure you would cut out all the nocturnal parties . . . I beseech your Lordship, leave off\\".Mostert, p. 365 In December 1799, Erskine was replaced by Lieutenant- General Henry Edward Fox, who immediately redistributed 800 troops from the garrison at Messina to Malta under Brigadier-General Thomas Graham. These troops filled the gap left by the withdrawal of Portuguese forces, which had been ordered to return to Lisbon. Disease began to spread within the city as rations became scarcer. The arrival of an aviso in January 1800 with the news of the events of 18 Brumaire that made Bonaparte First Consul of France prompted a brief respite and a public statement from Vaubois that the city would never be surrendered, although conditions continued to deteriorate. Starvation and relief Convoy battles At the beginning of February 1800, the Neapolitan government, reinstated in Naples after being expelled the year before, finally agreed to participate in the siege and 1,200 troops were embarked on a squadron led by Vice-Admiral Lord Keith's flagship HMS Queen Charlotte and landed on Malta.James, Vol. 3, p. 14 For a time, both Keith and Nelson remained with the blockade squadron, which consisted of six ships of the line, along with a few Neapolitan ships of the line, and several British and Neapolitan frigates. On 17 February a message arrived with the squadron from the frigate HMS Success, which had been stationed off Sicily to watch for French reinforcements. Captain Shuldham Peard reported that he was shadowing a squadron of six or seven French ships sailing in the direction of Malta.Bradford, p. 245 These vessels were a relief squadron, sent from Toulon with extensive food supplies and 3,000 additional troops under Contre-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Perr√©e in G√©n√©reux, one of the ships of the line that had escaped at the Nile two years earlier.Clowes, p. 419 On 18 February, the convoy was sighted by lookouts on Alexander. In the ensuing chase, Success captured a French transport and attacked the much larger G√©n√©reux.Woodman, p. 141 Although the frigate was damaged in the exchange, Success' second broadside mortally wounded Perr√©e and delayed the ship of the line long enough for HMS Foudroyant, under Lord Nelson, and HMS Northumberland to join the battle. Heavily outnumbered, G√©n√©reux surrendered.Bradford, p. 247 Capture of the Guillaume Tell Shortly after the capture of the G√©n√©reux, Keith returned to the Italian coast in Queen Charlotte, where his flagship was lost in a fire that killed more than 700 of its crew, although Keith was ashore at the time.Grocott, p. 92 Before departing, Keith issued strict instructions to Nelson that he was not to return to Palermo, but was to confine any shore leave in Sicily to Syracuse. Nelson ignored the order and by late March was in Palermo conducting an open love affair with Emma Hamilton.Mostert, p. 366 In his absence, Troubridge took over command of the blockade, delegating temporarily to Captain Manley Dixon. Dixon led the squadron on 31 March when Guillaume Tell attempted to break out on Valletta under Decr√©s. Spotted by the frigate HMS Penelope under Captain Henry Blackwood, Guillaume Tell was chased northwards and engaged by first Penelope and then by Dixon's HMS Lion, driving both ships back but suffering severe damage.Clowes, p. 421 Eventually the arrival of the powerful Foudroyant under Captain Sir Edward Berry proved too much for Decr√©s, but he continued fighting for another two hours before he was forced to surrender his battered and dismasted ship; in the engagement, he lost more than 200 men killed and wounded. Nelson's cruise In the aftermath of these French defeats at sea, and with the food supply in Valletta dwindling, the British sent another demand for capitulation. Vaubois again refused, with the reply \\"Cette place est en trop bon √©tat, et je suis moi-m√™me trop jaloux de bien servir mon pays et de conserver mon honneur, por √©couter vos propositions.\\" (\\"This place is in too good a situation, and I am too conscious of the service of my country and my honour, to listen to your proposals\\"). In reality, the situation was dire: during February, prices of basic foodstuffs stood at 16 francs for a fowl, 12 francs for a rabbit, 20 sous for an egg, 18 sous for a lettuce, 40 sous for a rat and six francs per pound for fish. For the civilian typhus patients, the only food available was horse-flesh soup.James, Vol. 3, p. 16 On 23 April, Nelson departed Palermo in Foudroyant, with both Sir William and Emma Hamilton on board as his guests. The party visited Syracuse and then travelled on to Valletta, where Berry took Foudroyant so close to the harbour that the ship came under fire from the French batteries. It was not hit, but Nelson was furious that Emma had been taken into danger and immediately ordered Berry to withdraw. His anger was exacerbated by Emma's refusal to retire from the quarterdeck during the brief exchange.Bradford, p. 249 From there, Foudroyant anchored at Marsa Sirocco, where Nelson and Emma lived together openly and were hosted by Troubridge and Graham. Sir William Hamilton, a prominent antiquarian as well as a diplomat, spent his time exploring the island.Bradford, p. 250 By early June, Nelson and his party had returned to Palermo, the beginning of a lengthy overland journey across Europe to Britain. Nelson also detached Foudroyant and Alexander from the blockade, again in defiance of Keith's explicit orders, to assist the Neapolitan royal family in their passage to Livorno.Mostert, p. 374 Enraged at Nelson's disobedience, Keith publicly remarked that \\"Lady Hamilton has had command of the fleet long enough\\".Bradford, p. 251 In May, Troubridge returned to Britain and was replaced in command by Captain George Martin, while Graham was succeeded by Major-General Henry Pigot.James, Vol. 3, p. 21 Surrender The British blockade continued to prevent French efforts to resupply Valletta during the early summer of 1800, and by August the situation was desperate: no horses or pack animals, dogs, cats, fowls or rabbits still lived within the city, the cisterns had been emptied and even firewood was in short supply. So desperate was the need for wood that the frigate Boudeuse, trapped by the blockade, was broken up for fuel by the beleaguered garrison. With defeat now inevitable, Vaubois gave orders that the frigates Diane and Justice were to attempt a breakout for Toulon, with minimal crews of approximately 115 men each.James, Vol. 3, p. 20 On 24 August, when the wind was favourable and the night dark enough to obscure their movements, the frigates put to sea. Almost immediately, lookouts on HMS Success sighted them and Captain Peard gave chase, followed by HMS Genereux and Northumberland. Diane under Captain Solen was too slow and Peard soon overhauled the under- strength French ship, which surrendered after a brief exchange of shot. The frigate later became HMS Niobe. Justice, under Captain Jean Villeneuve, was faster, however, and outran its pursuers, eventually making Toulon, the only ship from Malta to do so during the siege.Woodman, p. 143 On 3 September, with his men dying of starvation and disease at the rate of more than 100 a day, Vaubois called a council of his officers at which they unanimously decided to surrender.Clowes, p. 422 The next day, envoys were sent to the British and in the afternoon General Pigot and Captain Martin signed the agreed terms with Vaubois and Villeneuve. The Maltese were excluded from negotiations entirely, although their commander, Alexander Ball, subsequently became the first Civil Commissioner of Malta. The terms of the surrender were absolute: the island, its dependencies, fortifications and military supplies were all turned over to British control. This included the ships of the line Athenien and D√©go and the frigate Carthag√©naise (these were all French ships previously captured from the Order), although only Athenien was of sufficient standard to be incorporated into the Royal Navy, becoming HMS Athenienne. The other ships were broken up in their berths. The British also took two merchant ships and a variety of smaller warships.Clowes, p. 423 Aftermath The capture of Malta gave control of the central Mediterranean to Britain and was an important step in the invasion and liberation of Egypt from French rule in 1801.Gardiner, p. 78 An essential condition of the Treaty of Amiens in the same year, which brought an end to the French Revolutionary War, was that the British leave Malta. The Napoleonic Wars with the French Empire began soon afterwards, in part due to the unwillingness of the United Kingdom to comply with this clause of the treaty. The Russian Tsar Alexander I had a long-standing claim to the island as titular head of the Knights of St. John, and demanded that it be turned over to Russian control before agreeing any alliance with Britain. Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger flatly refused, and the Russians backed down, agreeing to an anti-French alliance.Mostert, p. 461 The island remained in British hands until its independence in 1964.Gardiner, p. 70 References Bibliography   Battles of the French Revolutionary Wars Conflicts in 1798 Conflicts in 1799 Conflicts in 1800 1798 in Malta 1799 in Malta 1800 in Malta Wars involving Malta Sieges involving Great Britain Mediterranean campaign of 1798 Sieges involving Portugal 18th-century rebellions Sieges involving Malta 18th century in Valletta French occupation of Malta Rebellions in Malta Insurgencies in Europe ","title":"Siege of Malta (1798‚Äì1800)"},{"id":"25161943","text":"The Center for Gravitational Wave Astronomy (CGWA) is a research center at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV).

This reflects the special status the station had when it was built as a division point and junction on the railway line. The town was named after Charles Melville Hays, former president of the railway.

At the time, about half of the small community of 4500 people were dependent on the railroad for their livelihoods. The yard at the station could see 20 trains a day and handle as many as 1000 cars over a 24-hour period at that point in time.

He was the head football coach at the Ripon College in Ripon, Wisconsin from 1924 to 1955. During his 32-year reign, Doehling coached teams to 15 conference championships, nine in the Midwest Conference and six from the old Wisconsin state conference known as The Big Four. Career Doehling began his coaching career in 1922 when he was offered a position at Central High School in Minneapolis, Minnesota. There he coached his teams to football and track state championships in successive years of 1923 and 1924. His success in the high school ranks, made him an attractive candidate to Ripon officials and in 1924 he was offered him the position as athletic director and head football coach. Ripon teams had struggled for years and Doehling was seen was given the charge of building the program from the ground up. Doehling knew the entire program needed an overhaul. He looked at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison athletic department as his model. Not only did Wisconsin have strong intercollegiate athletics teams, but they also had a huge intramural sports program. The coach saw this as something he felt should be in Ripon‚Äôs agenda and implemented it. By 1928, Ripon College had one of the strongest intramural departments in the state. Ripon's intramural program and intercollegiate sports flourished during his time. Ripon gained clout on both the local, regional and national levels during his term. One of Doehling's grandest victories came when his 1928 squad, a heavy underdog, defeated the powerhouse University of Chicago, 12‚Äì0. This was Ripon‚Äôs first ever victory against a Big Ten Conference opponent, and reportedly spread the Redmen name across the country. Thirty-thousand spectators came out to witness Ripon‚Äôs great upset, probably the largest crowd a Ripon team has ever played. Ripon teams did not always enjoy unbridled success during the Doehling era though. His final career record at Ripon was 94‚Äì99‚Äì24.

The doughnut-like pastry has a long history of popularity in Kannada, Telugu, Maharashtra, Orissa and Tamil civilization. They are similar in shape to vadai, but are not savoury and are eaten as a dessert. Adhirasam is a popular as an offering to the relatives during Deepavali festival, both at home and in temples in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Historical and cultural significance According to inscriptions from the 16th century Vijayanagara emperor Krishnadevaraya's time, the sweet was made from rice flour, jaggery, butter and pepper. At the annual festival at the Panchavarnesvar Temple in Nallur (located near Kumbakonam, Tamil Nadu), an offering of 6000 Adhirasams along with 6000 vadas is made to the Gods; the entire lot is cooked in the temple kitchen between sunrise and 11 pm, for the prayers that take place at midnight. It is most common Deepavali sweet preparation for Tamizhans. Preparation The authentic preparation takes about a week. First the rice is soaked in water and dried in shade and ground into a fine powder when the rice is 3/4th dried and retains some moisture. For adding sweet \\"vellam\\" (jaggery) is melted in water by boiling it till it reaches 'soft ball' consistency (235 ¬∞F‚Äì240 ¬∞F, if using a candy thermometer) and added to the rice flour along with some powdered cardamom to make a thick dough. It is then transferred to an earthenware pot and the top of the pot is closed with a thin white cloth. It is then allowed to ferment for about 3‚Äì5 days by placing it in the sunlight during the day time. Finally when the batter is ready for preparation, small balls of the dough is taken and flattened using fingers in a small piece of oil brushed banana leaf and deep fried in oil until golden brown. Then it is pressed with a flat bottomed bowl to remove the excess oil.

December 7, 2010 http://www.thesouthend.wayne.edu/index.php/m/article/2010/12/farewell_bernstein For the ability to enter Northwestern University School of Law, Bernstein fought the Law School Admissions Council against the \\"visual bias\\" of the Law School Admission Test (LSAT), claiming the test discriminates against the blind because of its requirements for interpreting visual material. He argued the test was no barometer of success in law school. Four universities agreed: Northwestern University, the University of Virginia, the University of Wisconsin and Vanderbilt University. At the time he was admitted, he was the only blind person in the law school. To complete his studies, Bernstein would memorize lectures and have notes read to him to memorize. For tests, he memorized test questions and entire fact patterns (the basis for the questions), some of which would be as long as 5 pages. The fact patterns would be repeatedly read to him until he committed the entire question to memory and could then provide an answer. He reportedly worked seven days a week for 13 hours each day. He received his juris doctor degree from Northwestern University School of Law in 1999.  Legal career overview  Bernstein joined the Law Offices of Sam Bernstein after graduating from Northwestern University School of Law. He is licensed to practice law in the states of Michigan and New York. Much of Bernstein's legal work has focused on protecting the rights of people with disabilities, which is done pro bono.Staff writer. \\"Alumni News: Richard Bernstein.\\" Northwestern magazine. Spring 2009. p.58 He successfully represented disabled Detroit residents in 2004 in an action against the City of Detroit to fix wheelchair lifts on buses as required by federal legislation. He also represented the Paralyzed Veterans of America in 2007 in an action against the University of Michigan for failing to include adequate accommodations for spectators with disabilities when planning renovations for the stadium. The suit resulted in increased seating for people with disabilities and their companions and enhanced accessible parking, restrooms and concessions. Also in 2007, Bernstein filed a lawsuit on behalf of people with disabilities, asserting that Oakland County, Michigan violated the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 because its road construction plans did not include mechanisms for people with visual impairments, people in wheelchairs and others with disabilities to safely cross the street at roundabouts. The County eventually agreed to install special safety equipment so that pedestrians, with or without disabilities, can activate traffic signals to stop traffic and get visual and audio confirmation that vehicles actually stopped, before crossing roundabout intersections.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that human circadian rhythms in many measures of performance and physiological activity have a 2-peak daily (circasemidian) pattern.Mitler MM, Carskadon MA, Czeisler CA, Dement WC, Dinges DF, Graeber RC. \\"Catastrophes, sleep, and public policy: consensus report\\".

Washington DC, US Government Printing Office, 1991. The word, circasemidian, is based upon the Latin words circa (\\"about\\"), semi (\\"half\\") and dia (\\"day\\"). Thus, this is a rhythm that has two cycles per day, and some investigators have referred to it as the semicircadian rhythm. It usually serves to (1) deepen the pre-dawn nadir in body temperature and cognitive performance, (2) create a flat spot during the early afternoon in the daytime increase in body temperature and cognitive performance (the \\"post- lunch dip\\"), and (3) heighten the early-evening peak in body temperature and cognitive performance.Miller, J.

Evidence No evidence exists to support the presence of a circasemidian rhythm in the rhythmic cells of the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the accepted internal timing source for the major circadian rhythms of the body. Thus, though it falls in the domain of an ultradian rhythm, the circasemidian rhythm may be the first harmonic of the circadian rhythm and not an intrinsic rhythm. However, a number of published data sets have shown a daily two-peak error pattern in industrial and transportation environments.Bjerner B, Holm A, Swennson A. \\"Diurnal variation in mental performance: A study of three-shift workers\\".

They operated the Cornwall Ironworks, making significant contributions to the American Revolutionary War effort. The brothers inherited the ironworks from their father in 1754, with Peter, as the youngest, receiving only a one-third interest. They took over operation of the ironworks about 1765 and expanded it successfully. Peter, who had more ironmaking experience, took over the nearby Hopewell Forges, making bar iron from pig iron produced by Curtis at Cornwall Furnace. They operated the business through and after the Revolution, becoming quite prosperous until they died, Peter in 1786 and Curtis in 1789. Most of the Cornwall Ironworks fell out of family hands during the period 1783 - 1802, to Robert Coleman who became Pennsylvania's first millionaire. But a portion remained with Peter Jr.'s heirs, who added to it to become major Pennsylvania producers of iron in the mid-19th century, operating out of Mount Hope Estate.  Patriotism  The Grubb brothers were major contributors to the Revolutionary War effort, their Cornwall Ironworks supplied cannon, ammunition, shot and saltpans (used to make salt from seawater) to the Colonial forces. George Washington personally visited Cornwall to inspect the facility. Both brothers were elected as militia colonels, Peter's unit was the 8th Lancaster Battalion and Curtis' was the 2nd Lancaster Battalion, both assigned to the Flying Camp.  Business career  Peter and his brother took over the operation of the ironworks about 1765, with Peter operating the Hopewell Forges and Curtis the Cornwall Furnace. They were successful operators of the ironworks through the Revolution. They were, however, complex individuals whose affairs were closely intertwined and became increasingly acrimonious. Their ongoing feuds and legal entanglements led to the fragmentation of the ironwork's ownership and its eventual loss by the Grubb family into the hands of Robert Coleman, who used it to build his fortune. Tensions between the brothers reached the crisis point in 1783 when Curtis decided to marry his 20-year-old cousin Ann Grubb, granddaughter of the brothers' uncle Nathaniel Grubb. Inheritance concerns by Curtis' oldest son, Peter III (actually called Peter Jr. to distinguish him from Curtis' brother Peter), resulted in him being given a portion of Curtis' holdings, which then required a legal division of the assets that had previously been shared informally. Included in Peter III's newly acquired assets were a one-third interest in the Hopewell Forges. Peter, who had been running the forges, became fearful and reacted by purchasing land at Mount Hope to build his own furnace in competition with his brother, going heavily into debt. The feud intensified and Peter III became concerned for the business and sold his interest to Robert Coleman, a friend who had worked for the brothers and was by then also an ironmaster. Curtis, concerned with the competition, allied himself with Coleman and tried various tactics to put Peter out of business. Succumbing to the pressure, Peter became distraught and committed suicide in 1786, at age 45. The ironworks were apportioned by the courts among Curtis, Peter's estate, and Coleman. Robert Coleman additionally acquired the Mount Hope furnace from Peter's estate. After Curtis' death in 1789 he operated the ironworks for the heirs until 1798, when they sold their interests to him. Thus Robert Coleman became the owner of most of the former Grubb holdings, which he added to his own and expanded to become Pennsylvania's first millionaire. The holdings remaining in Peter's estate were eventually expanded upon by his second son Henry Bates Grubb, whose family went on to become one of Pennsylvania's largest iron producers in the mid-19th century, with their center of operations at Mount Hope Estate.  Personal life  Before the brothers took over the ironworks in 1765, Peter had moved to the mansion built by his father and was learning the iron making business. He continued to reside in the mansion and took over operation of the Hopewell Forges. The Hopewell Forge Mansion still stands, denoted by a historic marker, on modern-day Route 322. Peter married Mary Shippen Burd, of Lancaster, in 1771, at the Burd family estate known as \\"Tinian.\\" They had two sons, Alan Burd Grubb and Henry Bates Grubb, but unfortunately Mary died from complications of childbirth. Peter never got over the loss, became despondent, and never married again. He was the less gregarious of the brothers, and being a minority partner in the ironworks probably didn't help his disposition. He developed an increasing drinking problem and was known for sometimes erratic behavior. On two occasions he was brought before Council to answer for statements he made while drinking; he was acquitted both times, as he had just \\"behaved in his usual mad way.\\" Certainly Peter's drinking problem contributed to his suicide in 1786; he took his own life at the Hopewell Forges and was buried there by his brother-in-law Jasper Yeates. Although Peter never married again, he did have a relationship with Hannah Bellarby Grubb, the adopted daughter of his uncle Samuel Grubb. Hannah came into Peter's household after Mary's death to help with the two infants. Peter and Hannah had a daughter, Hannah Elizabeth Grubb, late that same year. Peter acknowledged his daughter, later remembering her in his will, but did not marry Hannah. Hannah is believed to have then moved with her daughter to Curtis Grubb's household to help care for his two young children, whose mother had also died, probably in childbirth. Hannah later bore Curtis a son, Jehu Grubb. Peter also had a relationship with a Susan Brandelbury before he was married; a son was produced, Samuel Brandelbury, who was also remembered in Peter's will.  Sons in the family iron business  With their remaining share of Peter's estate as a foundation, this family became one of the largest iron producers in Pennsylvania during the mid-19th century.  Son of Peter Grubb Jr.  *Henry Bates Grubb (1774‚Äì1823) was the family's first \\"real\\" ironmaster; he bought out his brother, Alan Burd Grubb, and built the original mansion at Mount Hope Estate.

Jehu Grubb was born to Curtis, a widower not yet married to his third wife, apparently by his housekeeper and cousin Hannah Bellarby Grubb. Jehu, along with Hannah, was basically disowned by his father, who did not mention him in his will. The true nature of the relationship was discovered when Jehu and his mother \\"Aunt Ann\\" were identified during a close examination of the 1790 will of Curtis' 17-year-old son and principal heir Curtis Jr. Jehu was left 50 pounds annually for his support and education, showing his connection to the family. Both Hannah and Curtis Jr. were buried next to Curtis, and her headstone proclaims her as his wife. Ironically, although Curtis Grubb fathered six \\"legitimate\\" children, all but one died without issue; his only documented modern descendants carrying the Grubb surname are through Jehu. After Curtis Jr.'s early death, his heirs sold what was by then their half interest in the ironworks to Robert Coleman, in 1798. Over time, Coleman accumulated a 5/6 interest in the ironworks and went on to become Pennsylvania's first millionaire. The rest was retained by heirs of Curtis' brother Peter Jr., who build their own fortunes on it.  Personal life  Grubb was a man who overcame a difficult beginning, as the unacknowledged son of a prominent Pennsylvania ironmaster, but became an early settler and respected leading citizen of Stark County, Ohio. He served in the War of 1812, as a justice of the peace, and twice in the Ohio House of Representatives. He was married three times and twice widowed, with eleven children of his own and an unknown number of stepchildren. His father's heirs did provide for his education, and that undoubtedly provided a foundation for a successful life. In 1803 Grubb was on the tax rolls as a married landowner in Earl Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, where he was a hackle (a flax or hemp combing implement) maker and farmer, having purchased of land from Henry Schultz. The 1810 census lists him with a wife and two sons in Earl Township. His wife was probably a daughter of John Swiggart of Lancaster, and one of the sons was named Curtis, after Jehu's father. They had a third son William in Pennsylvania just before moving to Stark County in May 1811. In Ohio, Grubb first purchased a quarter section of patent land in Richland County, and another in what is now Summit County near Canal Fulton. These parcels were later sold, the first in 1815 and the second to Abraham Miller in 1833. In August 1812 Grubb was drafted as a private into the Ohio militia where he served during the War of 1812, until his discharge at Lower Sandusky on February 24, 1813. He subsequently purchased, on April 30, 1813, a third quarter section (Range 8, Twp. 11, Section 9, NE/4) in Plain Township, where he made his farm and lived out his life. In the 1850 census, his land was valued at $6,400, and in 1852 he donated a parcel to build the Whitehall School. There was also a cemetery, but the marked graves (only) were later moved for road widening. A corner of the Plain Twp. property was later acquired from Grubb's estate by his stepson and became the site of the beautiful and historic Jacob H. Bair House. Jacob was the son of Grubb's widow Elizabeth. Grubb's first wife died, most likely while giving birth to their fourth son Simon Peter on March 6, 1814. On October 8, 1815, Grubb married Elizabeth Reber, apparently a widow with children. Her parentage is unclear, as different documents give her surname as Reber and Sorrick; families with both names lived in the area. Some evidence suggests she may have been related to Frederick Reber and widowed by John Sorrick, but no connections to either family have been verified. Grubb and Elizabeth Reber had five children before she died in 1833. On September 1, 1833, he married his third wife Elizabeth Harter Bair, the widow of Abraham Bair. She was already a mother of seven children, and she bore Grubb three more. Grubb was, according to his widow, a man \\"six feet tall if not more, black hair and eyes, dark complexion.\\" Although his father Curtis Grubb was of Cornish ancestry, Jehu resided in Pennsylvania and Ohio communities with large Pennsylvania Dutch populations, and he married women of those backgrounds. When Jehu donated the land for the school, he stipulated that there was to be \\"no preaching, except Dunkards and Lutherans\\" which, of course, were primarily German faiths. His son Simon's bible was in German, and his descendants spoke \\"dutch\\" well into the 1900s. Andrew Keplar conducted the marriage ceremony for Grubb and Elizabeth and it was humorously recorded for posterity at the time: \\"You bromise to take this voman you holt by the hant to pe your vife, and that you thtick to her through hell-fire and dunder? Den I bronounce you man and voman, by cot Now, vers mine tollar?\\"Green Township - 598 Chapter XXVI (History of Summit County) Grubb died on December 10, 1854 at the age of 73 and is buried at St Jacob's cemetery on State Street in North Canton. His widow Elizabeth Harter Bair Grubb lived until 1887 and is buried alongside. She is credited with much of the information known about Jehu, as a result of claims she filed for benefits due her from his service in the War of 1812. On June 4, 1984, the Canton Repository ran an article in 1984 based on an interview with Elizabeth 100 years before in 1884. She had been 91 years old at the time, and recalled coming to Ohio with her father George Harter in 1806, when \\"Canton Public Square contained only a clump of bushes with just three log cabins.\\"  Notable Descendants  *Firman R.

Hiscott and starring Arthur Wontner. It was based on the 1915 Sherlock Holmes novel The Valley of Fear by Arthur Conan Doyle. It is the fourth film in the 1931‚Äì1937 film series starring Wontner as Sherlock Holmes. Plot Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson come out of retirement to investigate a mysterious murder. They find that an American criminal organisation called The Scowrers has asked evil mastermind Professor Moriarty to wreak vengeance on John Douglas, the informant who sent them to prison. Holmes outsmarts Moriarty, solves the murder and brings Moriarty to justice. Like all the films featuring Wontner as Holmes, this one has a contemporary (e.g. 1930's) setting, making the flashback sequence pitting undercover detective Douglas against the Scowrers somewhat problematical since, historically, the real-life incident on which this sequence is based, Pinkerton operative James McParland's infiltration of the Molly Maguires, occurred in the 1870s, a full half-century earlier.

Nicaragua has a professional baseball league, the Nicaraguan Professional Baseball League, consisting of four teams, playing in the winter, and an amateur league, El Campeonato German Pomares, playing in spring and summer. The national baseball team has been successful in the past, mainly throughout the 1970s. In many pick-up games, players have to improvise due to lack of equipment. Often, grapefruits, and rocks are used as baseballs. Nicaragua and near-by Panama are two countries who have baseball as their national sport, rather than soccer, the national sport of many Central American countries. History timeline Early history United States Marine Corps baseball team in Managua, Nicaragua, 1915. Baseball was introduced in the 1880s by Albert Addlesberg, an American businessman living in Bluefields. During this time, the area around Bluefields was known as the autonomous Mosquito Reserve and a strong British influence in the area was evidenced by the popularity of cricket. Addlesberg convinced two of the most popular cricket clubs to switch to baseball and supplied the locals with equipment he imported from New Orleans. Two teams were created in , the Southern and Four Roses. They began to play in and baseball has been played on the Mosquito Coast almost continuously since that time, but the entire region has long since been incorporated into the Republic of Nicaragua. The first 'official' game took place in between Managua and Granada. Carter Donaldson, who was the U.S. Consul in Nicaragua at the time, founded the first continuous team in 1904. United States Marines stationed in Nicaragua in the early part of the 20th century were also credited for bringing the sport to the country, and popularizing it in the area. 1960s and 1970s Professional baseball came to an end in Nicaragua in 1967, after years of political and economic problems. In the 1970s, however, baseball again became popular after the success of the Nicaragua national baseball team. 1980s and 1990s In the 1980s, popularity of baseball in the country began to decline. After the Nicaraguan civil war, baseball began to flourish again. The policy of Nicaraguan professional baseball before the 1990s was to discourage the recruitment of Nicaraguan players by Major League Baseball scouts. On August 6, 1990, the San Francisco Giants signed two players from Nicaragua, and considered building a baseball academy in a move that was seen as a step to normalizing the relationship between Nicaragua and Major League Baseball. During the 1996 Nicaraguan presidential election, candidates, Arnoldo Alem√°n, and Daniel Ortega, promised increased funding for the Nicaraguan national baseball team. Present day In the spring of 2004, professional baseball returned to Nicaragua for the first time since 1967. In a typical modern-day game, teams have sets of cheerleaders, as well as team mascots, and marching bands who play throughout the game. Dennis Mart√≠nez National Stadium, located in Managua, Nicaragua, is used by the Indios del B√≥er of the Nicaraguan Professional Baseball League. The stadium has been described being in poor shape by many, including Nicaraguan native, and former Major League Baseball pitcher Dennis Mart√≠nez, whom the stadium is named after. The World Baseball Classic has been criticized by NBC Sports writer Joe Connor, after the WBC invited national baseball teams from China, Australia, and Italy, over teams from Nicaragua, and Colombia, where the sport is considerably more popular. In 2009 it was announced that a privately funded baseball academy would be built by the International Baseball Association in Villa El Carmen. Nicaraguans in Major League Baseball Everth Cabrera was a Nicaraguan born Major League Baseball player. Professional baseball in Nicaragua The Nicaraguan Professional Baseball League (La Liga Nicarag√ºense de Beisbol Profesional in Spanish) is the professional baseball league in Nicaragua. There are four teams that compete against each other, the Indios del B√≥er, the Tigres del Chinandega, the Leones de Le√≥n, and the Orientales de Granada. There is one defunct team, the Fieras del San Fernando.

At different times, it was considered a Class C or Class D league. Seasons 1916 In 1916, the first East Texas League began play. A Class-D league, it folded on July 19 of that season. The \\"league champions\\", by default, were the Palestine Athletics and Lufkin Lumbermen, who both finished atop the league with a .609 winning percentage. The other teams in the league were the Nacogdoches Cogs, Rusk Governors, Jacksonville Tomato Pickers and a team based in Crockett, Texas that did not have a (known) nickname. Crockett, Nacogdoches and Rusk would never field a professional baseball team again. The Athletics dissolved following the season, with the next Palestine team showing up in 1925 as the Palestine Pals in the Texas Association. The Lumbermen dissolved as well, although a team with that name played in the West Dixie League in 1934. 1923‚Äì1926 The next incarnation of the league began play in 1923, and ran until 1926. After playing in the Texas‚ÄìOklahoma League in 1921 and 1922 as the Paris Snappers, the Paris Grays moved to the East Texas League and finished at the top with a 76-43 record in 1923, with the Longview Cannibals finishing last, with a 41-77 record. Other teams in the league that year were the Greenville Staplers who played in the Texas‚ÄìOklahoma League as the Greenville Togs in 1922; the Marshall Indians; the Mt. Pleasant Cats and Sulphur Springs Lions. The Cannibals, Cats and Indians returned to the league in 1924. The Greenville, Sulphur Springs and Paris-based teams did as well, however they underwent name changes: the Greenville Staplers became the Greenville Hunters, the Sulphur Springs Lions became the Sulphur Springs Saints and the Paris Grays became the Paris North Stars. In its very first season of existence, league newcomer the Tyler Trojans were league champions with an 83-37 record. Another team, the Texarkana Twins, was new to the league as well.East Texas League Returning to the league in 1925 were the Tyler Trojans, Greenville Hunters, Longview Cannibals, Texarkana Twins, Marshall Indians and Mt. Pleasant Cats. The Sulphur Springs Saints became the Sulphur Springs Spartans for 1925, and the Paris North Stars became the Paris Bearcats. The Bearcats won the league championship with a 76-46 record. The Spartans disbanded on June 7 of that year, and because of that the Cannibals consolidated with the Mt. Pleasant Cats, playing as the Longview-Mount Pleasant Longcats until July 12, when the team permanently settled in Longview. 1926 was the final year of the second incarnation of the East Texas League. The Longview Cannibals, Texarkana Twins, Greenville Hunters, Tyler Trojans and Paris Bearcats returned to the league with the names they held the previous year. The Marshall Indians became the Marshall Snappers-Indians. After finishing first in the league in 1925, the Bearcats finished last in the league in 1926, with a 39-81 record. The Cannibals finished with the best record in the league that year, with a mark of 83-39. 1931 The league was revived in 1931, lasting not even the whole season. The Longview Cannibals and Tyler Trojans returned to the league, and newcomers the Henderson Oilers and Kilgore Gushers joined the league as well. Tyler disbanded on May 5 and the entire league disbanded on May 7, with the default league champions being the Oilers who went 4-1. The Gushers and Trojans both went 1-3, while the Cannibals went 4-3. 1936‚Äì1940 In 1936, the league resumed play once again, this time until 1940. For the first time in the league's history, it was a C-level league, rather than a D-level league. Returning teams were the Tyler Trojans, Longview Cannibals and Henderson Oilers. The Kilgore team was now known as the Kilgore Braves, while the Marshall team, which did not participate in the 1931 incarnation, was known as the Marshall Orphans. Jacksonville and Palestine had representatives in the league for the first time since 1916, with teams known as the Jacksonville Jax and Palestine Pals, respectively. The Gladewater Bears were completely new to the league, coming from the West Dixie League, where they played in 1935. The Bears won the League Championship, as they beat the Trojans four games to two in the finals. The Trojans had placed first in the regular season standings that year, going 94-56, while the Bears went 93-59 to finish second in the league. The Braves finished last in the league, going 45-106. Following the season, the Bears ceased to exist in Gladewater. A new team with that name would show up in 1948, playing in the Lone Star League. The Tyler Trojans, Jacksonville Jax, Henderson Oilers, Palestine Pals and Longview Cannibals returned to the league for 1937 with their names the same. The Marshall team changed its name to the Marshall Tigers, while Kilgore became the Kilgore Rangers. Texarkana had a representative in the league for the first time since 1926, with a team known as the Texarkana Liners. Despite Tyler leading the league with an 85-52 record in the regular season, they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs. Jacksonville beat Marshall in the league finals four games to two, to become the league champions. Kilgore finished last in the league with a 42-97 record. For the first time in East Texas League history, the same exact same teams played in the league two consecutive seasons: 1937 and 1938. Following 1937, there were no league departures, and there were no name changes or new teams for the 1938 season. The Trojans, who had finished in fourth place in the regular season, beat the Oilers, who had finished in third place during the regular season, four games to three in the league finals to win the league championship. Marshall (84-55) and Texarkana (80-60) had finished first and second in the league, respectively, however they were knocked out of the playoffs in the first round. The Jax finished last with a 58-82 record. No teams would leave the league following 1938, and only one team would change its name for the 1939 season: the Kilgore Rangers became the Kilgore Boomers. Aside from that, every team would stay the same. The Henderson Oilers had the best record in the league, going 85-55, while the Jacksonville Jax went only 51-89. In the league finals, the second-place Boomers beat the first-place Oilers four games to zero. The Jax again finished last in the league, this time with a 51-89 record.Baseball Reference Bullpen 1940 was the final year of the fourth incarnation of the East Texas League. Each team returned from the previous season, and only one team underwent a name change: the Longview Cannibals became the Longview Texans. The third-place Trojans beat the fourth-place Tigers in the league championship. Longview had finished first in the league with a 79-53 record, but were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs. On June 5, both the Palestine Pals and Jacksonville Jax disbanded. The Marshall Tigers moved on to the Cotton States League for the 1941 season. The Texarkana Liners changed their name back to the Texarkana Twins and moved to the Cotton States League as well. 1946 The league made a one-year comeback in 1946, with the Oilers, Trojans and Jax returning. Texarkana came back with a new team name, the Texarkana Bears, as did Greenville (which hadn't had a team in the league since 1926), its team known as the Greenville Majors. Paris, too, returned with a team called the Paris Red Peppers, and Lufkin returned to the league for the first time since 1916, with a team known as the Lufkin Foresters. Sherman was entirely new to the league, with a team known as the Twins. Henderson finished atop the league with an 83-56 record, and they won the League Championship as well, defeating Texarkana four games to two. Lufkin finished last in the league with a 47-92 record. The league disbanded following the 1946 season. The Oilers, Jax, Foresters and Trojans moved on to the Lone Star League, while the Bears, Majors, Red Peppers and Twins moved on to the Big State League. The Twins became known as the Sherman‚ÄìDenison Twins. 1949‚Äì1950 1949 was the beginning of the sixth and final incarnation of the East Texas League. It would last until 1950. The Longview Texans returned to the league after not playing in it during the 1946 incarnation, coming from the Lone Star League. The Gladewater Bears returned as well, after not playing in the league since 1936. They too arrived from the Lone Star League. The Tyler Trojans and Henderson Oilers returned after spending time in the Lone Star League, as well. The Paris team arrived from the Big State League, changing its name from the Paris Rockets (it changed its name to the Rockets for the 1948 Big State League season) to the Paris Panthers. Kilgore returned as the Kilgore Drillers, coming from the Lone Star League. The Marshall team was now known as the Marshall Browns. They arrived from the Lone Star League, where they were known as the Marshall Comets in 1947 and Marshall Tigers in 1948. Bryan, Texas had a representative in the league for the first time, the Bryan Bombers. They arrived from the Lone Star League. So many team arrived from the Lone Star league because that league folded following the 1948 season. Longview finished first in the league in 1949, with an 89-51 record. Gladewater ended up winning the league championship, however, defeating the fourth-place Kilgore four games to zero. The Bombers finished last in the league, with a 48-91 record. Every team that played in the league in 1949 returned for 1950, with the Bombers changing their name to the Bryan Sports. The Sports and Paris Panthers disbanded on July 20. Gladewater led the league with a 92-45 record, but second-place Marshall beat fourth-place Longview four games to one in the finals. The league folded following the 1950 season. The Gladewater Bears, Marshall Browns, Henderson Oilers and Kilgore Drillers folded with it. The Longview Texans did not play in 1950, however Longview was represented by the Longview Cherokees in 1952 and the Longview Pirates in 1953 in the Big State League. The Tyler Trojans became the Tyler East Texans and moved to the Big State League. A team named the Paris Indians represented Paris in Big State League from 1952 to 1953. Paris had minor league teams through 1957. Bryan had minor league teams until 1954, although none in 1951 and 1952. References The Encyclopedia of Minor League Baseball: Second Edition.

The purpose and meaning of the endowment varied during the life of movement founder Joseph Smith. The term has referred to many such gifts of heavenly power, including the confirmation ritual, the institution of the High Priesthood in 1831, events and rituals occurring in the Kirtland Temple in the mid-1830s, and an elaborate ritual performed in the Nauvoo Temple in the 1840s. The term endowment has the most significance to adherents of the Latter Day Saint branch known as Mormonism, including most prominently The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), which practices a form of the Nauvoo endowment. The Nauvoo endowment ceremony, introduced by Joseph Smith and codified by Mormon leader Brigham Young, consisted of symbolic acts and covenants designed to prepare participants to officiate in priesthood ordinances, and to give them the key words and tokens they need to pass by angels guarding the way to heaven. In the LDS Church's modern practices, the endowment ceremony directs new participants to take a number of solemn oaths or covenants such as an oath of consecration to the LDS Church. Also in the LDS Church's modern practices, completing the endowment ceremony is a prerequisite to both full-time missionary service and temple marriage. In order to enter a temple and participate in the endowment ceremony, church members must hold a current temple recommend. 1830 endowments: Endowment of the Holy Spirit and confirmation A Latter Day Saint confirmation. Although it was not generally referred to as an endowment at the time, in retrospect, Latter Day Saints have viewed the confirmation, first performed on April 6, 1830, and attendant outpourings of the spiritual gifts, as an early type of endowment.See, e.g., (James E. Talmage, an apostle and theologian of the LDS Church, describing confirmation as an \\"endowment\\" of the Holy Spirit); Testimony of Mary Pate Eaton, Temple Lot Case transcript (1893) p. 272 (\\"By endowments in the church I understand as endowments in the Bible is spoken of [as the] endowment of the Holy Spirit.). The term derives from the Authorized King James Version, referring to the spiritual gifts given the disciples of Jesus on the day of Pentecost, in which they were \\"endowed with power from on high\\".Gospel of Luke 24:49 (Authorized King James Version) (\\"And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you; but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem until ye be endowed with power from on high.\\") Subsequent to these early confirmations, Mormons exhibited what they viewed as spiritual gifts such as having visions, prophecy, gift of healing, gift of knowledge, gift of tongues.(Joseph Smith History, 1839 draft). Unlike the other Latter Day Saint endowments, confirmation has continued to coexist with later endowments as a separate Latter Day Saint ordinance. In the Community of Christ, formerly known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, the \\"endowment of the Holy Spirit\\" such as occurred on the day of Pentecost is the only recognized endowment. 1831 Kirtland endowment: Conferral of the High Priesthood The first reference to an endowment by Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, was in early 1831, some days after Smith was joined in his ministry by Sidney Rigdon, a newly converted Campbellite minister from Ohio. Rigdon's congregation also was converted to Smith's Church of Christ. Rigdon had apparently disagreed with the Campbellites in that he believed in a Pentecostal endowment of power beyond the abiding presence of the Holy Spirit endowed upon confirmation.. While Rigdon believed the teachings of the early Mormon missionaries who converted him, he thought the missionaries were lacking in heavenly power.. In January 1831, Smith issued a revelation where he wrote that after Mormons relocated to Kirtland, Ohio, they would \\"be endowed with power from on high\\" and \\"sent forth\\". (D&C; 38:32) Smith reiterated this in February 1831, stating that the \\"elders of the church Smith reaffirmed that the faithful members would \\"be taught from on high\\" and \\"endowed with power\\", (D&C; 43:16). and that God would call the elders of the church together in Kirtland in a general conference and \\"pour out [his] Spirit upon them in that day they assemble themselves together\\". D&C; 44:1-2 In a revelation given to an individual, Smith assured the man that \\"at the conference meeting he [would] be ordained unto power from on high\\".Kirtland Revelation Book, p. 91. This general conference of the church was held from June 3 to June 6, 1831, in which a number of men were ordained to the \\"High\\" or \\"Melchizedek\\" Priesthood for the first time,Cannon and Cook, 6-7; The official church history states that during this conference, \\"the authority of the Melchizedek priesthood was manifested and conferred for the first time upon several of the Elders\\" . The editor of this history believed this was a mistake, because it would not be consistent with the then-common Mormon belief that the priesthood had been conferred prior to the church's founding in 1830. Several modern historians believe the official record was not mistaken and is consistent with other historical records, and that this 1831 endowment marked the restoration of the Melchizedek priesthood (Quinn). which ordination \\"consisted [of] the endowment--it being a new order--and bestowed authority\\".Corrill, 18 Later that year, an early convert who had left the church claimed that many of the Saints \\"have been ordained to the High Priesthood, or the order of Melchizedek; and profess to be endowed with the same power as the ancient apostles were\\". 1833 Kirtland endowment: School of the Prophets In 1833, Joseph Smith established what he called a School of the Prophets, Although the events at this school were never specifically called an \\"endowment\\", it has been classified as such by scholars including Gregory A. Prince because of similarities with the 1831 and 1836 endowments, and the fact that part of the school's stated intention was so that the church's elders could be \\"endowed with power from on high\\".. At the beginning, the school was \\"accompanied by a pentecostal outpouring, including speaking in tongues, prophesying and 'many manifestations of the holy spirit'\\". It included a new Latter Day Saint ordinance of foot washing. The 1836 Kirtland endowment Kirtland Temple, site of the Kirtland endowment in 1836 and 1837. A year and a half after the June 1831 endowment, Smith said he received a revelation in December 1832 to prepare to build a \\"house of God\\", or a temple.D&C; 88:119. A revelation soon followed identifying the location of the temple in Kirtland, Ohio,D&C; 94:3. and another revelation affirmed that in this building the Lord \\"design[ed] to endow those [he] had chosen with power on high\\".D&C; 95:8. In a later revelation the Lord indicated that the elders were to be \\"endowed with power from on high; for [he had] prepared a greater endowment\\" than the 1831 endowment.Kirtland Revelation Book, p. 98. Upon the completion of the Kirtland Temple after three years of construction (1833‚Äì36), the elders of the church gathered for this second promised endowment in early 1836. The Kirtland Temple endowment ceremonies were patterned after Old Testament sacerdotal practices. They consisted of preparatory washings, administered in private homes, in which men washed and purified their bodies with water and alcohol . After this, they gathered in the temple where they were anointed with specially consecrated oil and with blessings pronounced upon their heads by Smith and other church leaders. The men's anointings were sealed with uplifted hands. Following these ceremonies many men reported participating in extraordinary spiritual experiences, such as seeing visions, speaking prophecies or receiving revelations. The culmination of the endowment was a solemn assembly, held on March 30, in which the men partook of the sacrament and then washed each other's feet. Those present spent the rest of the day and night prophesying, speaking in tongues, testifying and exhorting each other.Cook and Backman, Kirtland Elders' Quorum Record, 1836-1841 pp. 1-9. To those present it was a \\"day of Pentecost\\". Indeed, Smith told the solemn assembly that they could now \\"go forth and build up the kingdom of God\\".Joseph Smith Diary, March 30, 1836, LDS Church Archives. On April 3, 1836, Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery recounted the appearance of Jesus to them in the Kirtland Temple, and his acceptance of the building as his house. This was followed by the appearance of three Old Testament prophets: Moses, Elias, and Elijah, each of whom bestowed additional temple-related authority on the two men.D&C; 110:1-16. Initially, Smith intended the Kirtland endowment to become an annual affair; he administered the same ceremonies again in 1837.Jesse, \\"The Kirtland Diary of Wilford Woodruff\\", BYU Studies [Summer 1972]: 365-399. However, because of persecution the Mormons largely abandoned Kirtland and its temple in 1838-39 and moved west. As Smith's theology expanded during the 1840s, the Kirtland endowment was superseded by the Nauvoo endowment. Mormons looked back upon the Kirtland Temple rituals with the authority bestowed by the three prophets as preparatory to the greater endowment revealed at Nauvoo. This was certainly the view of Brigham Young, who said: The Nauvoo endowment A woman dressed in the robes of the Nauvoo endowment, circa the 1870s. On May 3, 1842, Joseph Smith prepared the second floor of his Red Brick Store, in Nauvoo, Illinois, to represent \\"the interior of a temple as circumstances would permit\\".(Anderson and Bergera, 2) The next day, May 4, he introduced the Nauvoo endowment ceremony to nine associates: Associate President and Patriarch to the Church Hyrum Smith (Smith's brother); first counselor in the First Presidency, William Law; three of the Twelve Apostles, Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards; Nauvoo stake president, William Marks; two bishops, Newel K. Whitney and George Miller; and a close friend, Judge James Adams of Springfield, Illinois. Throughout 1843 and 1844, Smith continued to initiate other men, as well as women, into the endowment ceremony. By the time of his death on June 27, 1844, more than 50 persons had been admitted into the Anointed Quorum, the name by which this group called themselves. The Nauvoo endowment consisted of two phases: (1) an initiation, and (2) an instructional and testing phase. The initiation consisted of a washing and anointing, culminating in the clothing of the patron in a \\"Garment of the Holy Priesthood\\", which is thereafter worn as an undergarment. The instructional and testing phase of the endowment consisted of a scripted reenactment of Adam and Eve's experience in the Garden of Eden (performed by live actors called officiators; in the mid-20th century certain portions were adapted to a film presentation). \\"President Gordon B. Hinckley\\", Ensign (supp.), Mar. 2008, pp. 2‚Äì13. The instruction is punctuated with personal covenants, gestures, and a prayer circle around an altar. At the end of instruction, the initiate's knowledge of symbolic gestures and key-words is tested at a \\"veil\\", a symbolic final frontier for the initiate to face the judgment of Jesus, before entering the presence of God in the celestial kingdom.

All routes are maintained by the Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department (AHTD). Route description Cabot to Hunter Highway 38 begins at Highway 367 at the city limits of Cabot in Lonoke County. The highway connects agricultural areas in Arkansas's Grand Prairie, including rice and soybeans as well as aquaculture. Passing east through Austin, where it has an intersection with Highway 319. The intersection is near the Sears House, an 1860 antebellum home in late Greek Revival-Italianate style listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Continuing east, Highway 38 runs through unincorporated area in eastern Lonoke County, intersecting Highway 321 near Sylvania and Highway 31 near Butlerville before entering Prairie County. White River at Des Arc, with Highway 38 passing over on the bridge in the background Upon entering Prairie County, Highway 38 continues to pass through rural, agricultural areas with small settlements at intersections with other state highways. The highway intersects Highway 13 at Hickory Plains, Highway 86 at Hayley, and Highway 11 at Four Mile Corner. Highway 11 begins a concurrency with Highway 38 eastward toward Des Arc, the county seat for the northern district of Prairie County. Entering Des Arc, Highway 38 and Highway 11 intersect Highway 323 near the Lower White River Museum State Park. Highway 323 runs to the downtown business district, with Highway 38 turning northeast and bypassing most of the city. In northern Des Arc, the concurrency with Highway 11 ends, with Highway 11 turning due north toward the Bayou De View Wildlife Management Area and Searcy. This intersection also contains Highway 323Y, which is a short spur route providing access to downtown Des Arc. Highway 38 continues along the northern edge of Des Arc, passing the historic Oak Grove Cemetery, listed on the NRHP, and crossing over the White River on a 1970 steel through truss bridge. Highway 33 overlaps Highway 38 in eastern Prairie County until the Woodruff County line, when Highway 33 turns north toward Augusta, ending the concurrency. Running east as a section line road, Highway 38 enters Woodruff County at Little Dixie and runs east to Cotton Plant. Serving as Main Street in Cotton Plant, the highway passes intersects Highway 306 before beginning a short overlap with Highway 17 through historic downtown Cotton Plant. East of the city, Highway 38 briefly dips into Monroe County and crosses Bayou DeView before meeting US 49 at a rural intersection, where the route terminates. I-40 to Hughes Highway 38 near US 79 in Hughes West Memphis History The route from Des Arc to Cotton Plant was originally designated as part of Arkansas State Road B-7 in the original 1924 state highway plan. This route ran north from the Stuttgart area to Cotton Plant via Des Arc, roughly along present-day US 63, Highway 11 and Highway 38. During the 1926 Arkansas state highway numbering, the Highway 38 designation was assigned to the short connector highway between Des Arc and Cotton Plant. The route was extended west to Cabot in the late 1930s. A minor routing change west of Hughes involving a new bridge over Blackfish Bayou occurred in 1956. Highway 38 was extended east in 1958 following the construction of a new US 79 alignment in Hughes. Highway 38 was extended east, creating an overlap with Highway 50 and terminating at Highway 147 near Horseshoe Lake.

A further 29 were hospitalised. The explosion occurred in the Xinxing coal mine shortly before dawn, at 02:30 CST, when 528 people were believed to be in the pit. Of these, 420 are believed to have been rescued. Location and explosion The mine, located close to the China‚ÄìRussia border, is owned by the state-run Heilongjiang Longmay Mining Holding Group Co., Ltd., which has been open since 1917, and produces 12 million tons of coal per year, making it one of the largest and oldest coal mines in the country. The explosion itself, a preliminary investigation concluded, was caused by trapped, pressurised gases underground, caused by poor ventilation in the mine shaft. The blast was powerful enough that it was felt six miles away. Many nearby buildings were damaged, including one next to the mine whose roof was blown off. The director of Hegang General hospital, where the injured were being treated, told the Xinhua News Agency that \\"most of the injured are suffering from compound injuries, such as respiratory injuries, broken bones and gas poisoning\\". Response A Chinese official said rescue efforts were being impeded by gas and debris from collapsed tunnels. The death toll makes it the worst accident of its type within the past two years. While hope for those trapped was fading, a Chinese official stated that the effort was still a rescue operation. San Jingguang, a mining company spokesman stated that \\"if we haven't found them, to us that means they are still alive.\\" Chinese Vice-Premier Zhang Dejiang visited the site to inspect rescue efforts on the afternoon of November 21, while President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao are both said to have \\"made instructions on the rescue work\\". Both have also expressed condolences for those killed. Meanwhile, Li Zhanshu, the governor of Heilongjiang called for increased safety standards in Chinese mines, and the provincial work safety bureau vowed to step up its mining reform programme. Chinese state television initially reported that the death toll was 31. It later reported the number of dead had more than doubled over the extremely cold night. As a result of the accident, the director, vice director and chief engineer of the mining company are reported to have been removed from their individual posts. The Chinese state prosecutor is investigating the possibility that criminal negligence was responsible for the disaster. Chinese state media reported on November 23, 2009, that an investigation had concluded poor management was to blame for the incident. Relatives of the deceased also claimed on November 23 that officials did not notify them of the accident.

Apart from an Anglophile element urging early support for the British and an anti-Tsarist element sympathizing with Germany's war against Russia, American public opinion reflected that of the president: the sentiment for neutrality was particularly strong among Irish Americans, German Americans, and Scandinavian Americans, as well as among church leaders and women in general. On the other hand, even before World War I had broken out, American opinion had been overall more negative toward Germany than toward any other country in Europe.Barnes, Harry Elmer. The Genesis of the World War (1925) pp. 590‚Äì591 Over time, especially after reports of German atrocities in Belgium in 1914 and following the sinking of the passenger liner RMS Lusitania in 1915, American citizens increasingly came to see Germany as the aggressor in Europe. While the country was at peace, American banks made huge loans to the Entente powers, which were used mainly to buy munitions, raw materials, and food from across the Atlantic. Wilson made minimal preparations for a land war but he did authorize a major ship-building program for the United States Navy. The president was narrowly re-elected in 1916 on an anti-war ticket. In 1917, with Russia experiencing political upheaval, and with the remaining Entente nations low on credit, Germany appeared to have the upper hand in Europe, while the Ottoman Empire, Germany's ally, held on to its territory in modern-day Iraq, Syria and Palestine. However, an Entente economic embargo and naval blockade was by now causing shortages of fuel and food in Germany, at which point Germany decided to resume unrestricted submarine warfare. The aim was to break the transatlantic supply chain to Britain from other nations, although the German high command realized that sinking American-flagged ships would almost certainly bring the United States into the war. Germany also made a secret offer to help Mexico regain territories lost in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War in an encoded telegram known as the Zimmermann Telegram, which was intercepted by British intelligence. Publication of that communique outraged Americans just as German submarines started sinking American merchant ships in the North Atlantic. Wilson then asked Congress for \\"a war to end all wars\\" that would \\"make the world safe for democracy\\", and Congress voted to declare war on Germany on April 6, 1917. U.S. troops began major combat operations on the Western Front under General John J. Pershing in the summer of 1918. Main issues Naval blockade Britain used its large navy to prevent cargo vessels entering German ports, mainly by intercepting them in the North Sea between the coasts of Scotland and Norway. The wider sea approaches to Britain and France, their distance from German harbors and the smaller size of the German surface fleet all made it harder for Germany to reciprocate. Instead, Germany used submarines to lie in wait for, and then sink, merchant ships heading for British and French ports. =The strategy behind the blockade= The Royal Navy successfully stopped the shipment of most war supplies and food to Germany. Neutral American ships that tried to trade with Germany were seized or turned back by the Royal Navy who viewed such trade as in direct conflict with the Allies' war efforts. The impact from the blockade became apparent very slowly because Germany and its allies controlled extensive farmlands and raw materials. It was eventually successful because Germany and Austria-Hungary had decimated their agricultural production by taking so many farmers into their armies. By 1918, German cities were on the verge of a major food shortage; the front-line soldiers were on short rations and were running out of essential supplies.Eric W. Osborne, Britain's economic blockade of Germany, 1914‚Äì1919 (2004) Germany also considered a blockade. \\"England wants to starve us\\", said Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, the man who built the German fleet and who remained a key advisor to the Kaiser Wilhelm II. \\"We can play the same game. We can bottle her up and destroy every ship that endeavors to break the blockade\\".Ernest May, The World War and American Isolation, 1914‚Äì1917 (1959) p. 115 quote from Dec 1914. Unable to challenge the more powerful Royal Navy on the surface, Tirpitz wanted to scare off merchant and passenger ships en route to Britain. He reasoned that since the island of Britain depended on imports of food, raw materials, and manufactured goods, scaring off a substantial number of the ships would effectively undercut its long-term ability to maintain an army on the Western Front. While Germany had only nine long-range U-boats at the start of the war, it had ample shipyard capacity to build the hundreds needed. However, the United States demanded that Germany respect the international agreements upon \\"freedom of the seas\\", which protected neutral American ships on the high seas from seizure or sinking by either belligerent. Furthermore, Americans insisted that causing the deaths of innocent American civilians was unwarranted and grounds for a declaration of war. C. R. M. F. Cruttwell, A history of the Great War, 1914‚Äì1918 (2007) p. 191 The Royal Navy frequently violated America's neutral rights by seizing merchant ships. Wilson's top advisor, Colonel Edward M. House commented that, \\"The British have gone as far as they possibly could in violating neutral rights, though they have done it in the most courteous way\\".Edward House, The intimate papers of Colonel House: Vol 2 (1928) p. 73 When Wilson protested these violations of American neutrality, the Royal Navy backed down. The New York Times article expressed the immediate recognition of the serious implications of the sinking, this lead story on May 8 having a section (below what is pictured here) titled \\"Nation's Course in Doubt\\". German submarines torpedoed ships without warning, causing sailors and passengers to drown. Berlin explained that submarines were so vulnerable that they dared not surface near merchant ships that might be carrying guns and which were too small to rescue submarine crews. Britain armed most of its merchant ships with medium caliber guns that could sink a submarine, making above-water attacks too risky. In February 1915, the United States warned Germany about the misuse of submarines. On April 22, the German Imperial Embassy warned U.S. citizens against boarding vessels to Britain, which would have to face German attack. On May 7, Germany torpedoed the British passenger liner RMS Lusitania, sinking her. This act of aggression caused the loss of 1,198 civilian lives, including 128 Americans. The sinking of a large, unarmed passenger ship, combined with the previous stories of atrocities in Belgium, shocked Americans and turned public opinion hostile to Germany, although not yet to the point of war.Frank Trommler, \\"The Lusitania Effect: America's Mobilization against Germany in World War I\\" German Studies Review 32#2 (2009), pp. 241-266 online Wilson issued a warning to Germany that it would face \\"strict accountability\\" if it sank more neutral U.S. passenger ships. Berlin acquiesced, ordering its submarines to avoid passenger ships. By January 1917, however, Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and General Erich Ludendorff decided that an unrestricted submarine blockade was the only way to achieve a decisive victory. They demanded that Kaiser Wilhelm order unrestricted submarine warfare be resumed. Germany knew this decision meant war with the United States, but they gambled that they could win before America's potential strength could be mobilized.Spencer Tucker, The Great War, 1914‚Äì18 (1997) p. 133 However, they overestimated how many ships they could sink and thus the extent Britain would be weakened. Finally, they did not foresee that convoys could and would be used to defeat their efforts. They believed that the United States was so weak militarily that it could not be a factor on the Western Front for more than a year. The civilian government in Berlin objected, but the Kaiser sided with his military.Ernest May, The World War and American Isolation, 1914‚Äì1917 (1959) p. 414 Business considerations The beginning of war in Europe coincided with the end of the Recession of 1913‚Äì1914 in America. Exports to belligerent nations rose rapidly over the first four years of the War from $824.8 million in 1913 to $2.25 billion in 1917. Loans from American financial institutions to the Allied nations in Europe also increased dramatically over the same period. Economic activity towards the end of this period boomed as government resources aided the production of the private sector. Between 1914 and 1917, industrial production increased 32% and GNP increased by almost 20%. The improvements to industrial production in the United States outlasted the war. The capital build-up that had allowed American companies to supply belligerents and the American army resulted in a greater long-run rate of production even after the war had ended in 1918. In 1913, J. P. Morgan, Jr. took over the House of Morgan, an American-based investment bank consisting of separate banking operations in New York, London, and Paris, after the death of his father, J. Pierpont Morgan. The House of Morgan offered assistance in the wartime financing of Britain and France from the earliest stages of the war in 1914 through America's entrance in 1917. J.P. Morgan & Co., the House of Morgan's bank in New York, was designated as the primary financial agent to the British government in 1914 after successful lobbying by the British ambassador, Sir Cecil Spring Rice. The same bank would later take a similar role in France and would offer extensive financial assistance to both warring nations. J.P. Morgan &Co.; became the primary issuer of loans to the French government by raising money from American investors. Morgan, Harjes, the House of Morgan's French affiliated bank, controlled the majority of the wartime financial dealings between the House of Morgan and the French government after primary issuances of debt in American markets. Relations between the House of Morgan and the French government became tense as the war raged on with no end in sight. France's ability to borrow from other sources diminished, leading to greater lending rates and a depressing of the value of the franc. After the war, in 1918, J.P. Morgan & Co. continued to aid the French government financially through monetary stabilization and debt relief. Because America was still a declared neutral state, the financial dealings of American banks in Europe caused a great deal of contention between Wall Street and the U.S. government. Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan strictly opposed financial support of warring nations and wanted to ban loans to the belligerents in August 1914. He told President Wilson that \\"refusal to loan to any belligerent would naturally tend to hasten a conclusion of the war.\\" Wilson at first agreed, but then reversed himself when France argued that if it was legal to buy American goods then it was legal to take out credits on the purchase. J.P. Morgan issued loans to France including one in March 1915 and, following negotiations with the Anglo-French Financial Commission, another joint loan to Britain and France in October 1915, the latter amounting to US$500,000,000. Although the stance of the U.S. government was that stopping such financial assistance could hasten the end of the war and therefore save lives, little was done to insure adherence to the ban on loans, in part due to pressure from Allied governments and American business interests. The American steel industry had faced difficulties and declining profits during the Recession of 1913‚Äì1914. As war began in Europe, however, the increased demand for tools of war began a period of heightened productivity that alleviated many U.S. industrial companies from the low- growth environment of the recession. Bethlehem Steel took particular advantage of the increased demand for armaments abroad. Prior to American entrance into the war, these companies benefit from unrestricted commerce with sovereign customers abroad. After President Wilson issued his declaration of war, the companies were subjected to price controls created by the U.S. Trade Commission in order to insure that the U.S. military would have access to the necessary armaments. By the end of the war in 1918, Bethlehem Steel had produced 65,000 pounds of forged military products and 70 million pounds of armor plate, 1.1 billion pounds of steel for shells, and 20.1 million rounds of artillery ammunition for Britain and France. Bethlehem Steel took advantage of the domestic armaments market and produced 60% of the American weaponry and 40% of the artillery shells used in the war. Even with price controls and a lower profit margin on manufactured goods, the profits resulting from wartime sales expanded the company into the third largest manufacturing company in the country. Bethlehem Steel became the primary arms supplier for the United States and other allied powers again in 1939. Views of the elites Historians divide the views of American political and social leaders into four distinct groupings‚Äîthe camps were mostly informal: The first of these were the Non-Interventionists, a loosely affiliated and politically diverse anti-war movement which sought to keep the United States out of the war altogether. Members of this group tended to view the war as a clash between several imperialistic and militaristic European great powers, who due to these perceived negative stances were seen as corrupt and thus unworthy of being supported. Others were pacifists, who objected on moral grounds. Prominent leaders included Democrats like former Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan, industrialist Henry Ford and publisher William Randolph Hearst; Republicans Robert M. La Follette, Senator from Wisconsin and George W. Norris, Senator from Nebraska; and Progressive Party activist Jane Addams. At the far-left end of the political spectrum the Socialists, led by their perennial candidate for President Eugene V. Debs and movement veterans like Victor L. Berger and Morris Hillquit, were staunch anti-militarists and opposed to any US intervention, branding the conflict as a \\"capitalist war\\" that American workers should avoid. However, after the US did join the war in April, 1917 a schism developed between the anti-war Party majority and a pro- war faction of Socialist writers, journalists and intellectuals led by John Spargo, William English Walling and E. Haldeman-Julius. This group founded the rival Social Democratic League of America to promote the war effort among their fellow Socialists.James Weinstein, \\"Anti-War Sentiment and the Socialist Party, 1917‚Äì1918.\\" Political Science Quarterly 74#2 (1959): 215‚Äì239. in JSTOR Next were the more moderate Liberal-Internationalists. This bipartisan group reluctantly supported a declaration of war against Germany with the postwar goal of establishing collective international security institutions designed to peacefully resolve future conflicts between nations and to promote liberal democratic values more broadly. This groups' views were advocated by interest groups such as the League to Enforce Peace. Adherents included US President Woodrow Wilson, his influential advisor Edward M. House, former President William Howard Taft, famed inventor Alexander Graham Bell, Wall Street financier Bernard Baruch and Harvard University President Abbott Lawrence Lowell. Finally, there were the so-called Atlanticists. Ardently pro-Entente, they had strongly championed American intervention in the war since 1915. Their primary political motivation was to both prepare the US for war with Germany and to forge an enduring military alliance with Great Britain. This group actively supported the Preparedness Movement and was strong among the Anglophile political establishment of the northeast, boasting such luminaries as former President Theodore Roosevelt, Major General Leonard Wood, prominent attorney and diplomat Joseph Hodges Choate, former Secretary of War Henry Stimson, journalist Walter Lippman and Senators Henry Cabot Lodge, Sr. of Massachusetts and Elihu Root of New York.Ross A. Kennedy, The Will to Believe: Woodrow Wilson, World War I, and America's Strategy for Peace and Security (Kent State University Press, 2009) Public opinion Parties A surprising factor in the development of American public opinion was how little the political parties became involved. Wilson and the Democrats in 1916 campaigned on the slogan \\"He kept us out of war!\\", saying a Republican victory would mean war with both Mexico and Germany. His position probably was critical in winning the Western states.John Milton Cooper, Jr., Woodrow Wilson (2009) pp. 341‚Äì2, 352, 360 Charles Evans Hughes, the GOP candidate, insisted on downplaying the war issue.Merlo J. Pusey, Charles Evans Hughes (1951) vol 1, p. 356 The Socialist party talked peace. Socialist rhetoric declared the European conflict to be \\"an imperialist war\\". It won 2% of the 1916 vote for Eugene V. Debs, blamed the war on capitalism and pledged total opposition. \\"A bayonet\\", its propaganda said, \\"was a weapon with a worker at each end\\".Bernard J. Brommel, \\"The pacifist speechmaking of Eugene V. Debs.\\" Quarterly Journal of Speech 52.2 (1966): 146-154. When war began, however, about half the Socialists, typified by Congressman Meyer London, supported the decision and sided with the pro-Allied efforts. The rest, led by Debs, remained ideological and die-hard opponents.Seymour Martin Lipset and Gary Marks, It didn't happen here: why socialism failed in the United States (2001) p. 184 Many socialists came under investigation from the Espionage Act of 1917 and many suspected of treason were arrested, including Debs. This would only increase the Socialist's anti-war groups in resentment toward the American government. Workers, farmers, and African Americans The working class was relatively quiet and tended to divide along ethnic lines. At the beginning of the war, neither working men nor farmers took a large interest in the debates on war preparation.Lawrence O. Christensen, \\"World War I in Missouri,\\" Missouri Historical Review, 90 (1996), 330-354, 410-428.Edwin Costrell, How Maine viewed the war, 1914‚Äì1917 (1940)John C. Crighton, Missouri and the World War, 1914‚Äì1917: a study in public opinion (1947) Samuel Gompers, head of the AFL labor movement, denounced the war in 1914 as \\"unnatural, unjustified, and unholy\\", but by 1916 he was supporting Wilson's limited preparedness program, against the objections of Socialist union activists. In 1916 the labor unions supported Wilson on domestic issues and ignored the war question.Joseph A. McCartin, Labor's Great War: The Struggle for Industrial Democracy and the Origins of Modern American Labor Relations, 1912‚Äì1921 (1998) pp. 34, 57 The war at first disrupted the cotton market; the Royal Navy blockaded shipments to Germany, and prices fell from 11 cents a pound to only 4 cents. By 1916, however, the British decided to bolster the price to 10 cents to avoid losing Southern support. The cotton growers seem to have moved from neutrality to intervention at about the same pace as the rest of the nation.Arthur S. Link, Woodrow Wilson and the Progressive Era (1954) pp. 169‚Äì72 Midwestern farmers generally opposed the war, especially those of German and Scandinavian descent. The Midwest became the stronghold of isolationism; other remote rural areas also saw no need for war., Christopher C. Gibbs, The great silent majority: Missouri's resistance to World War I (1988) The African-American community did not take a strong position one way or the other. A month after Congress declared war, W. E. B. Du Bois called on African-Americans to \\"fight shoulder to shoulder with the world to gain a world where war shall be no more\\".Panikos Panayi, \\"Minorities in Wartime: National and Racial Groupings in Europe, North America, and Australia During the Two World War\\"(1992) p. 170 Once the war began and black men were drafted, they worked to achieve equality.Mark Ellis, \\"America's Black Press, 1914‚Äì18,\\" History Today, Sept 1991, Vol. 41, Issue 9 Many had hoped the community's help in the war efforts abroad would earn civil rights at home. When such civil liberties were still not granted, many African-Americans grew tired of waiting for recognition of their rights as American citizens.Panikos Panayi, \\"Minorities in Wartime: National and Racial Groupings in Europe, North America, and Australia During the Two World Wars\\" (1992) p. 171 South There was a strong antiwar element among poor rural whites in the South and border states.Jeanette Keith, \\"The politics of Southern draft resistance, 1917-1918: Class, race, and conscription in the rural South.\\" Journal of American History 87.4 (2001): 1335-1361. In rural Missouri for example, distrust of powerful Eastern influences focused on the risk that Wall Street would lead America into war.Christopher C.

Antiwar sentiment was strongest among Christians affiliated with the Churches of Christ, the Holiness movement and Pentecostal churches. J. Douglas Smith, in Georgia Historical Quarterly (2006) 90#3 pp 469-71. Congressman James Hay, Democrat of Virginia was the powerful chairman of the House Committee on Military Affairs. He repeatedly blocked prewar efforts to modernize and enlarge the army. Preparedness was not needed because Americans were already safe, he insisted in January 1915: : Isolated as we are, safe in our vastness, protected by a great navy, and possessed of an army sufficient for any emergency that may arise, we may disregard the lamentations and predictions of the militarists.George C. Herring, \\"James Hay and the Preparedness Controversy, 1915‚Äì1916.\\" Journal of Southern History (1964) 30#4 pp. 383‚Äì404 quote, p. 386 in JSTOR Educated, urban, middle-class southerners generally supported entering the war, and many worked on mobilization committees. In contrast to this many rural southern whites opposed entering the war.Rich Man's War, Poor Man's Fight: Race, Class, and Power in the Rural South During the First World War, Jeanette Keith, 2004. Pg. 138 Those with more formal education were more in favor of entering the war and those in the south with less formal education were more likely to oppose entering the war. Letters to newspapers with spelling or grammatical errors were overwhelmingly letters which opposed entry into the war, whereas letters with no spelling or grammatical errors were overwhelming those which supported entry into the war., Rich Man's War, Poor Man's Fight: Race, Class, and Power in the Rural South During the First World War, Jeanette Keith, 2004.

Pg. 41 By coincidence, there were some regions of the south which were more heavily in favor of intervention than others. Georgia provided the most volunteers per capita out of any state in the union before conscription and had the highest portion of pro-British newspapers before America's entry into the war. There were five competing newspapers which covered the region of Southeast Georgia, all of whom were outspokenly Anglophilic during the decades preceding the war, and during the early phases of the war. All five of which also highlighted German atrocities during the rape of Belgium and the murder of Edith Cavell. Other magazines with nationwide distribution which were pro-British such as The Outlook and The Literary Digest had a disproportionately high distribution throughout every region of the state of Georgia as well as the region of northern Alabama in the area around Huntsville and Decatur (when the war began there were 470 volunteers from the state of Alabama, of these, over 400 came from Huntsville-Decatur region).Nothing Less Than War: A New History of America's Entry into World War I By Justus D.

Almost none called for intervening on Germany's side, instead calling for neutrality and speaking of the superiority of German culture. As more nations were drawn into the conflict, however, the English-languages press increasingly supporting Britain, while the German-American media called for neutrality while also defending Germany's position. Chicago's Germans worked to secure a complete embargo on all arms shipments to Europe. In 1916, large crowds in Chicago's Germania celebrated the Kaiser's birthday, something they had not done before the war.Leslie V. Tischauser, The Burden of Ethnicity: The German Question in Chicago, 1914‚Äì1941 (Garland, 1990) pp. 21‚Äì23 German Americans in early 1917 still called for neutrality, but proclaimed that if a war came they would be loyal to the United States. By this point, they had been excluded almost entirely from national discourse on the subject.Frederick C. Luebke, Bonds of Loyalty: German-Americans and World War I (1974) pp. 200‚Äì207 German- American Socialists in Milwaukee, Wisconsin actively campaigned against entry into the war.See Wisconsin Historical Society, \\"World War I, at home and in the trenches\\" Christian churches and pacifists Come on in, America, the Blood's Fine! (1917) by M.A. Kempf. Leaders of most religious groups (except the Episcopalians) tended to pacifism, as did leaders of the woman's movement. The Methodists and Quakers among others were vocal opponents of the war.John F. Piper, The American Churches in World War I (1985). President Wilson, who was a devout Presbyterian, would often frame the war in terms of good and evil in an appeal for religious support of the war.Samuel S. Hill, Charles H. Lippy, and Charles Reagan Wilson, Encyclopedia of Religion in the South (2005) p. 297 A concerted effort was made by pacifists including Jane Addams, Oswald Garrison Villard, David Starr Jordan, Henry Ford, Lillian Wald, and Carrie Chapman Catt. Their goal was to encourage Wilson's efforts to mediate an end of the war by bringing the belligerents to the conference table. Finally in 1917 Wilson convinced some of them that to be truly anti-war they needed to support what he promised would be \\"a war to end all wars\\". Once war was declared, the more liberal denominations, which had endorsed the Social Gospel, called for a war for righteousness that would help uplift all mankind. The theme‚Äîan aspect of American exceptionalism‚Äîwas that God had chosen America as his tool to bring redemption to the world. American Catholic bishops maintained a general silence toward the issue of intervention. Millions of Catholics lived in both warring camps, and Catholic Americans tended to split on ethnic lines in their opinions toward American involvement in the war. At the time, heavily Catholic towns and cities in the East and Midwest often contained multiple parishes, each serving a single ethnic group, such as Irish, German, Italian, Polish, or English. American Catholics of Irish and German descent opposed intervention most strongly. Pope Benedict XV made several attempts to negotiate a peace. All of his efforts were rebuffed by both the Allies and the Germans, and throughout the war the Vatican maintained a policy of strict neutrality. Jewish Americans  In 1914‚Äì1916, there were few Jewish Americans in favor of American entry into the war. New York City, with its Jewish community numbering 1.5 million, was a center of antiwar activism, much of which was organized by labor unions which were primarily on the political left and therefore opposed to a war that they viewed to be a battle between several great powers.Christopher M.

Vol. I: The Attitude of American Jews to World War I, the Russian Revolutions of 1917, and Communism (1914‚Äì1945) (New York: KTAV, 1973) includes a great deal of undigested information. Of greatest concern to Jewish Americans was the tsarist regime in Russia because it was notorious for tolerating and inciting pogroms and following anti-Semitic policies. As historian Joseph Rappaport reported through his study of Yiddish press during the war, \\"The pro-Germanism of America's immigrant Jews was an inevitable consequence of their Russophobia\\".Joseph Rappaport, Jewish Immigrants and World War I: A Study of Yiddish Attitudes(1951), p. 78 However the fall of the tsarist regime in March 1917 removed a major obstacle for many Jews who refused to support American entry into the war on the side of the Russian Empire. The draft went smoothly in New York City, and left-wing opposition to the war largely collapsed when Zionists saw the possibility of using the war to demand a state of Israel.Sterba, Good Americans (2003), 68‚Äì69, 76, 79, 167-69 Irish- Americans The most effective domestic opponents of the war were Irish- American Catholics. They had little interest in the continent, but were neutral about helping the United Kingdom because it had recently enacted the Government of Ireland Act 1914, allowing Irish Home Rule. However, the Act was suspended until the war ended. John Redmond and the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) declared that Irish Volunteers should support America's pro-Allied war efforts first; his political opponents argued that it was not the time to support Britain in its attempt to \\"strengthen and expand her empire\\".Malcolm Campbell, Ireland's New Worlds, (2008), p. 164 The attacks on the IPP and pro- Allied press showed a firm belief that a German victory would hasten the achievement of an independent Irish state. Yet rather than proposing intervention on behalf of the Germans, Irish American leaders and organizations focused on demanding American neutrality. But the increased contact between militant Irish nationalists and German agents in the United States only fueled concerns of where the primary loyalties of Irish Americans lay.Malcolm Campbell, Ireland's New Worlds, (2008), p. 174 Nevertheless, close to 1,000 Irish-born Americans died fighting with the U.S. armed forces in WWI.Smolenyak, Megan. The Easter Rising in Dublin in April 1916 was defeated within a week and its leaders executed by firing squad. The mainstream American press treated the uprising as foolish and misguided, and suspected it was largely created and planned by the Germans. Overall public opinion remained faithfully pro-Entente.Malcolm Campbell, Ireland's New Worlds, (2008), p. 170 Irish-Americans dominated the Democratic party in many large cities, and Wilson had to take account of their political viewpoints. Irish- American political efforts influenced the United States into defining its own objectives from the war separate from those of its allies, which were primarily (among other objectives) self-determination for the various nations and ethnic groups of Europe. The Irish-American community thought they had Wilson's promise to promote Irish independence in exchange for their support of his war policies, but after the war they were disappointed by his refusal to support them in 1919. Wilson saw the Irish situation purely as an internal affair and did not perceive the dispute and the unrest in Ireland as the same scenario being faced by the various other nationalities in Europe (as a fall- out from World War I).Kennedy, Billy. \\"Woodrow Wilson\\". Ulstervirginia.com. . Retrieved November 10, 2011. The progress of the Irish Race Conventions give a flavour of the differing and changing opinions during the war. Pro-Allied immigrants Some British immigrants worked actively for intervention. London-born Samuel Insull, Chicago's leading industrialist, for example, enthusiastically provided money, propaganda, and means for volunteers to enter the British or Canadian armies. After the United States' entry, Insull directed the Illinois State Council of Defense, with responsibility for organizing the state's mobilization. Immigrants from eastern Europe usually cared more about politics in their homeland than politics in the United States. Spokesmen for Slavic immigrants hoped that an Allied victory would bring independence for their homelands. Large numbers of Hungarian immigrants who were liberal and nationalist in sentiment, and sought an independent Hungary, separate from the Austro-Hungarian Empire lobbied in favor of the war and allied themselves with the Atlanticist or Anglophile portion of the population. This community was largely pro-British and anti-German in sentiment.The Hungarian-Americans by Steven B√©la V√°rdy; Twayne Publishers, 1985 page 87‚Äì99Christopher M.

Nagi AMS Press, Jan 1, 1989, pp. 33‚Äì35 The state of Wisconsin had the distinction of being the most isolationist state due to the large numbers of German-Americans, socialists, pacifists and others present in the state, however, the exception to this were pockets within the state such as the city of Green Bay. Green Bay had a large number of pro-Allied immigrants, including the largest Belgian immigrant community in the entire country, and for this reason anti-German sentiment and pro-war sentiment were both significantly higher in Green Bay than in the country as a whole.The Great War Comes to Wisconsin: Sacrifice, Patriotism, and Free Speech in a Time of Crisis by Richard L. Pifer, pg. 36-39 There was a large Serbian-American community in Alaska which also was enthusiastically in favor of American entry into World War I. In the case of Alaska, which was at the time a territory, thousands of Serbian immigrants and Serbian-Americans volunteered early to join the United States Army shortly after the declaration of war, after the community had been outspokenly in favor of America's entry into the war before this. During the First World War, many Serbian Americans volunteered to fight overseas, with thousands coming from Alaska.Serb World,1988,Neven Publishing Corporation,volume=5‚Äì6,page 40 Popular pacifism The song \\"I Didn't Raise My Boy To Be A Soldier\\" was a hit in 1915, selling 650,000 copies. Its expression of popular pacifist sentiment \\"helped make the pacifist movement a hard, quantifiable political reality to be reckoned with.\\" Henry Ford supported the pacifist cause by sponsoring a large-scale private peace mission, with numerous activists and intellectuals aboard the \\"Peace Ship' (the ocean liner Oscar II). Ford chartered the ship in 1915 and invited prominent peace activists to join him to meet with leaders on both sides in Europe. He hoped to create enough publicity to prompt the belligerent nations to convene a peace conference and mediate an end to the war. The mission was widely mocked by the press, which wrote about the \\"Ship of Fools.\\" Infighting between the activists, mockery by the press contingent aboard, and an outbreak of influenza marred the voyage. Four days after the ship arrived in neutral Norway, a beleaguered and physically ill Ford abandoned the mission and returned to the United States; he had demonstrated that independent small efforts accomplished nothing.Barbara S. Kraft, The Peace Ship: Henry Ford's Pacifist Adventure in the First World War (1978) p. 81 German agents On July 24, 1915, the German embassy's commercial attach√©, Heinrich Albert, left his briefcase on a train in New York City, where an alert Secret Service agent, Frank Burke, snatched it up.Max Wallace, The American Axis (New York, New York: St. Martin's Press, 2003), pp. 224‚Äì225. Wilson let the newspapers publish the contents, which indicated a systematic effort by Berlin to subsidize friendly newspapers and block British purchases of war materials. Berlin's top espionage agent, debonnaire Franz Rintelen von Kleist was spending millions to finance sabotage in Canada, stir up trouble between the United States and Mexico and to incite labor strikes.H.C. Peterson, Propaganda for war: The campaign against American neutrality, 1914‚Äì1917 (1968) Germany took the blame as Americans grew ever more worried about the vulnerability of a free society to subversion. Indeed, one of the main fears Americans of all stations had in 1916‚Äì1919 was that spies and saboteurs were everywhere. This sentiment played a major role in arousing fear of Germany, and suspicions regarding everyone of German descent who could not \\"prove\\" 100% loyalty.Link 3:556ff Preparedness movement By 1915, Americans were paying much more attention to the war. The sinking of the Lusitania had a strong effect on public opinion because of the deaths of American civilians. That year, a strong \\"Preparedness\\" movement emerged.George C. Herring, \\"James Hay and the Preparedness Controversy, 1915‚Äì1916.\\" Journal of Southern History (1964) 30#4 pp. 383‚Äì404 in JSTOR Proponents argued that the United States needed to immediately build up strong naval and land forces for defensive purposes; an unspoken assumption was that America would fight sooner or later. General Leonard Wood (still on active duty after serving a term as Chief of Staff of the Army), former president Theodore Roosevelt, and former secretaries of war Elihu Root and Henry Stimson were the driving forces behind Preparedness, along with many of the nation's most prominent bankers, industrialists, lawyers and scions of prominent families. Indeed, there emerged an \\"Atlanticist\\" foreign policy establishment, a group of influential Americans drawn primarily from upper-class lawyers, bankers, academics, and politicians of the Northeast, committed to a strand of Anglophile internationalism. Representative was Paul D. Cravath, one of New York's foremost corporation lawyers. For Cravath, in his mid-fifties when the war began, the conflict served as an epiphany, sparking an interest in international affairs that dominated his remaining career. Fiercely Anglophile, he strongly supported American intervention in the war and hoped that close Anglo-American cooperation would be the guiding principle of postwar international organization. Advertisement for the film The Battle Cry of Peace The Preparedness movement had a \\"realistic\\" philosophy of world affairs‚Äîthey believed that economic strength and military muscle were more decisive than idealistic crusades focused on causes like democracy and national self-determination. Emphasizing over and over the weak state of national defenses, they showed that America's 100,000-man Army even augmented by the 112,000 National Guardsmen, was outnumbered 20 to one by Germany's army, which was drawn from a smaller population. Similarly in 1915, the armed forces of Britain and the her Empire), France, Russia, Austria-Hungary, Ottoman Empire, Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Belgium, Japan and Greece were all larger and more experienced than the United States military, in many cases significantly so. Reform to them meant UMT or \\"universal military training\\". They proposed a national service program under which the 600,000 men who turned 18 every year would be required to spend six months in military training, and afterwards be assigned to reserve units. The small regular army would primarily be a training agency. Antimilitarists complained the plan would make America resemble Germany (which required two years' active duty). Advocates retorted that military \\"service\\" was an essential duty of citizenship, and that without the commonality provided by such service the nation would splinter into antagonistic ethnic groups. One spokesman promised that UMT would become \\"a real melting pot, under which the fire is hot enough to fuse the elements into one common mass of Americanism\\". Furthermore, they promised, the discipline and training would make for a better paid work force. Hostility to military service was strong at the time, and the program failed to win approval. In World War II, when Stimson as Secretary of War proposed a similar program of universal peacetime service, he was defeated.Chambers 93; Weigley Army 345 Underscoring its commitment, the Preparedness movement set up and funded its own summer training camps at Plattsburgh, New York, and other sites, where 40,000 college alumni became physically fit, learned to march and shoot, and ultimately provided the cadre of a wartime officer corps.Very few young men from wealthy or prominent families considered a career in the Army or Navy then or at any time in American history. The highest social background of cadets, exemplified by George Patton, West Point 1909, and Lucius Clay, 1918, was oldest son of a locally prominent family. Suggestions by labor unions that talented working-class youth be invited to Plattsburgh were ignored. The Preparedness movement was distant not only from the working classes but also from the middle-class leadership of most of small-town America. It had had little use for the National Guard, which it saw as politicized, localistic, poorly armed, ill trained, too inclined to idealistic crusading (as against Spain in 1898), and too lacking in understanding of world affairs. The National Guard on the other hand was securely rooted in state and local politics, with representation from a very broad cross section of American society. The Guard was one of the nation's few institutions that (in some northern states) accepted blacks on an equal footing. The Democratic party saw the Preparedness movement as a threat. Roosevelt, Root and Wood were prospective Republican presidential candidates. More subtly, the Democrats were rooted in localism that appreciated the National Guard, and the voters were hostile to the rich and powerful in the first place. Working with the Democrats who controlled Congress, Wilson was able to sidetrack the Preparedness forces. Army and Navy leaders were forced to testify before Congress to the effect that the nation's military was in excellent shape. In fact, neither the Army nor Navy was in shape for war. The Navy had fine ships but Wilson had been using them to threaten Mexico, and the fleet's readiness had suffered. The crews of the Texas and the New York, the two newest and largest battleships, had never fired a gun, and the morale of the sailors was low. In addition, it was outnumbered and outgunned when compared to the British and German navies. The Army and Navy air forces were tiny in size. Despite the flood of new weapons systems created by the British, Germans, French, Austro-Hungarians, Italians, and others in the war in Europe, the Army was paying scant attention. For example, it was making no studies of trench warfare, poison gas, heavy artillery, or tanks and was utterly unfamiliar with the rapid evolution of aerial warfare. The Democrats in Congress tried to cut the military budget in 1915. The Preparedness movement effectively exploited the surge of outrage over the Lusitania in May 1915, forcing the Democrats to promise some improvements to the military and naval forces. Wilson, less fearful of the Navy, embraced a long-term building program designed to make the fleet the equal of the Royal Navy by the mid-1920s, although this would not be achieved until World War II. \\"Realism\\" was at work here; the admirals were Mahanians and they therefore wanted a surface fleet of heavy battleships second to none‚Äîthat is, equal to Britain. The facts of submarine warfare (which necessitated destroyers, not battleships) and the possibilities of imminent war with Germany (or with Britain, for that matter), were simply ignored. Hypothetical partition of the United States by the Central Powers that appeared on the cover of Life in 1916 Wilson's program for the Army touched off a firestorm.Link, Woodrow Wilson, pp. 179ff Secretary of War Lindley Garrison adopted many of the proposals of the Preparedness leaders, especially their emphasis on a large federal reserve and abandonment of the National Guard. Garrison's proposals not only outraged the localistic politicians of both parties, they also offended a strongly held belief shared by the liberal wing of the Progressive movement. They felt that warfare always had a hidden economic motivation. Specifically, they warned the chief warmongers were New York bankers (like J. P. Morgan) with millions at risk, profiteering munition makers (like Bethlehem Steel, which made armor, and DuPont, which made powder) and unspecified industrialists searching for global markets to control. Antiwar critics blasted them. These special interests were too powerful, especially, Senator La Follette noted, in the conservative wing of the Republican Party. The only road to peace was disarmament, reiterated Bryan. Garrison's plan unleashed the fiercest battle in peacetime history over the relationship of military planning to national goals.John Patrick Finnegan, Against the Specter of a Dragon: The Campaign for American Military Preparedness, 1914-1917 (Greenwood Press, 1974). In peacetime, War Department arsenals and Navy yards manufactured nearly all munitions that lacked civilian uses, including warships, artillery, naval guns, and shells. Items available on the civilian market, such as food, horses, saddles, wagons, and uniforms were always purchased from civilian contractors. Armor plate (and after 1918, airplanes) was an exception that has caused unremitting controversy for a century. After World War II, the arsenals and Navy yards were much less important than giant civilian aircraft and electronics firms, which became the second half of the \\"military-industrial complex.\\" Peace leaders like Jane Addams of Hull House and David Starr Jordan of Stanford redoubled their efforts, and now turned their voices against the president because he was \\"sowing the seeds of militarism, raising up a military and naval caste\\". Many ministers, professors, farm spokesmen, and labor union leaders joined in, with powerful support from Claude Kitchin and his band of four dozen southern Democrats in Congress who took control of the House Military Affairs Committee.Alex Mathews Arnett, \\"Claude Kitchin Versus the Patrioteers.\\" North Carolina Historical Review 14.1 (1937): 20-30. onlineGeorge C. Herring, \\"James Hay and the Preparedness Controversy, 1915-1916.\\" Journal of Southern History 30.4 (1964): 383-404. Wilson, in deep trouble, took his cause to the people in a major speaking tour in early 1916, a warmup for his reelection campaign that fall.William L. Genders, \\"Woodrow Wilson and the 'Preparedness Tour'of the Midwest, January‚ÄìFebruary, 1916.\\" Australasian Journal of American Studies 9.1 (1990): 75-81. Wilson seems to have won over the middle classes, but had little impact on the largely ethnic working classes and the deeply isolationist farmers. Congress still refused to budge, so Wilson replaced Garrison as Secretary of War with Newton Baker, the Democratic mayor of Cleveland and an outspoken opponent of preparedness (Garrison kept quiet, but felt Wilson was \\"a man of high ideals but no principles\\"). The upshot was a compromise passed in May 1916, as the war raged on and Berlin was debating whether America was so weak it could be ignored. The Army was to double in size to 11,300 officers and 208,000 men, with no reserve, and a National Guard that would be enlarged in five years to 440,000 men. Summer camps on the Plattsburg model were authorized for new officers, and the government was given $20 million to build a nitrate plant of its own. Preparedness supporters were downcast, the antiwar people were jubilant: America would now be too weak to go to war. The House gutted Wilson's naval plans as well, defeating a \\"big navy\\" plan by 189 to 183, and scuttling the battleships. However news arrived of the great sea battle between Britain and Germany, the Battle of Jutland. The battle was used by the navalists to argue for the primacy of seapower; they then took control in the Senate, broke the House coalition, and authorized a rapid three-year buildup of all classes of warships. A new weapons system, naval aviation, received $3.5 million, and the government was authorized to build its own armor plate factory. The very weakness of American military power encouraged Berlin to start its unrestricted submarine attacks in 1917. It knew this meant war with America, but it could discount the immediate risk because the U.S. Army was negligible and the new warships would not be at sea until 1919, by which time it believed the war would be over, with Germany victorious. The argument that armaments led to war was turned on its head: most Americans came to fear that failure to arm in 1916 made aggression against the U.S. more likely. Size of the military The United States had remained aloof from the arms race in which the European powers had engaged during the decades leading up to the war. The American army numbered slightly more than 100,000 active duty soldiers in 1916; by that time the French, British, Russian and German armies had all fought battles in which more than 10,000 men had been killed in one day, and fought campaigns in which total casualties had exceeded 200,000. In other words, the entire United States Army, as it stood on the eve of intervention, could be wiped out in a single week of the fighting that had characterized the war to date. Americans felt an increasing need for a military that could command respect. As one editor put it, \\"The best thing about a large army and a strong navy is that they make it so much easier to say just what we want to say in our diplomatic correspondence.\\" Berlin thus far had backed down and apologized when Washington was angry, thus boosting American self-confidence. America's rights and America's honor increasingly came into focus. The slogan \\"Peace\\" gave way to \\"Peace with Honor\\". The Army remained unpopular, however. A recruiter in Indianapolis noted that, \\"The people here do not take the right attitude towards army life as a career, and if a man joins from here he often tries to go out on the quiet\\". The Preparedness movement used its easy access to the mass media to demonstrate that the War Department had no plans, no equipment, little training, no reserve, a laughable National Guard, and a wholly inadequate organization for war. At a time when European generals were directing field armies that numbered several corps, on combat fronts that stretched for dozens or hundreds of miles, no active duty American general officer had commanded more than a division. Motion pictures like The Battle Cry of Peace (1915) depicted invasions of the American homeland that demanded action.Herring, \\"James Hay and the Preparedness Controversy, 1915‚Äì1916,\\" p. 383 Navy The readiness and capability of the U.S. Navy was a matter of controversy. The press at the time reported that the only thing the military was ready for was an enemy fleet attempting to seize New York harbor‚Äîat a time when the German battle fleet was penned up by the Royal Navy. The Navy Secretary Josephus Daniels was a journalist with pacifist leanings.Paolo Coletta, American Secretaries of the Navy (1980) 2:526-41 He had built up the educational resources of the Navy and made its Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island an essential experience for would-be admirals. However, he alienated the officer corps with his moralistic reforms, including no wine in the officers' mess, no hazing at the Naval Academy, and more chaplains and YMCAs. Daniels, as a newspaperman, knew the value of publicity. In 1915 he set up the Naval Consulting Board headed by Thomas Edison to obtain the advice and expertise of leading scientists, engineers, and industrialists. It popularized technology, naval expansion, and military preparedness, and was well covered in the media.Theodore A. Thelander, \\"Josephus Daniels and the Publicity Campaign for Naval and Industrial Preparedness before World War I,\\" North Carolina Historical Review (1966) 43#3 pp. 316‚Äì332 But according to Coletta he ignored the nation's strategic needs, and disdaining the advice of its experts, Daniels suspended meetings of the Joint Army and Navy Board for two years because it was giving unwelcome advice, chopped in half the General Board's recommendations for new ships, reduced the authority of officers in the Navy yards where ships were built and repaired, and ignored the administrative chaos in his department. Bradley Fiske, one of the most innovative admirals in American naval history, in 1914 was Daniels' top aide; he recommended a reorganization that would prepare for war, but Daniels refused. Instead he replaced Fiske in 1915 and brought in for the new post of Chief of Naval Operations an unknown captain, William Benson. Chosen for his compliance, Benson proved to be a wily bureaucrat who was more interested in preparing the U.S. Navy for the possibility of an eventual showdown with Britain than an immediate one with Germany. Benson told Sims he \\"would as soon fight the British as the Germans\\". Proposals to send observers to Europe were blocked, leaving the Navy in the dark about the success of the German submarine campaign. Admiral William Sims charged after the war that in April 1917, only ten percent of the Navy's warships were fully manned; the rest lacked 43% of their seamen. Light antisubmarine ships were few in number, as if Daniels had been unaware of the German submarine menace that had been the focus of foreign policy for two years. The Navy's only warfighting plan, the \\"Black Plan\\" assumed the Royal Navy did not exist and that German battleships were moving freely about the Atlantic and the Caribbean and threatening the Panama Canal. Daniels' tenure would have been even less successful save for the energetic efforts of Assistant Secretary Franklin D. Roosevelt, who effectively ran the Department. His most recent biographer concludes that, \\"it is true that Daniels had not prepared the navy for the war it would have to fight.\\" Decision for war \\"Hurting Their Feelings\\": Political cartoon from November 9, 1915, shows the British lion and John Bull reading a newspaper about American anti-war protests and crying, while American ships and cargo appear in the harbor behind them By 1916 a new factor was emerging‚Äîa sense of national self-interest and American nationalism. The unbelievable casualty figures in Europe were sobering‚Äîtwo vast battles caused over one million casualties each. Clearly this war would be a decisive episode in the history of the world. Every effort to find a peaceful solution was frustrated. Decision making Kendrick Clements claims bureaucratic decision-making was one of the main sources pushing the United States to declaring war on Germany and aligning itself with the Allies. He cites the State Department's demand that Germany's submarines obey outdated 18th century sailing laws as one of the first missteps by the United States bureaucracy regarding the war. By doing so, the United States had essentially given Germany the choice of whether or not the U.S. would enter the war. Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan spent most of the fall of 1914 out of contact with the State Department, leaving the more conservative Robert Lansing with the ability to shape American foreign policy at the time. One of these decisions was made in response to British protests that the Germans were using U.S. radio towers to send messages to their warships. Immediately prior to the war starting in 1914, Britain had cut all cable communications leading out of Germany, including the trans-Atlantic cable. The US Government permitted German embassies to use the US cable lines for \\"proper\\" diplomatic business. Germany argued that usage of the towers was necessary to allow efficient contact between the U.S. and Germany. Lansing responded by requiring both sides to give the U.S. Navy copies of the messages they sent over the towers. The French and British were still able to use the cables, ensuring that Germany would be the only belligerent required to provide the U.S. with their messages. This and other seemingly small decisions made by Lansing during this time would eventually stack up, shifting American support towards the Allies.Kendrick A. Clements, \\"Woodrow Wilson and World War I.\\" Presidential Studies Quarterly (2004) 34#1 pp. 62‚Äì82. Zimmermann Telegram 1917 political cartoon about the Zimmermann Telegram Once Germany had decided on unrestricted submarine warfare in January 1917 it tried to line up new allies, especially Mexico. Arthur Zimmermann, the German foreign minister, sent the Zimmermann Telegram to Mexico on January 16, 1917. Zimmermann invited Mexico (knowing their resentment towards America since the 1848 Mexican Cession) to join in a war against the United States if the United States declared war on Germany. Germany promised to pay for Mexico's costs and to help it recover the territory forcibly annexed by the United States in 1848. These territories included the present day states of California, Nevada, Utah, most of Arizona, about half of New Mexico and a quarter of Colorado. British intelligence intercepted and decoded the telegram and passed it to the Wilson administration. The White House would release it to the press on March 1. Anger grew further as the Germans began sinking American ships, even as isolationists in the Senate launched a filibuster to block legislation for arming American merchant ships to defend themselves.Cooper, Woodrow Wilson (2011) pp. 378‚Äì79Thomas Boghardt, The Zimmermann Telegram: Intelligence, Diplomacy, and America's Entry into World War I (2012) Excerpt and text search, summarized in Thomas Boghardt's The Zimmermann Telegram: Diplomacy, Intelligence and The American Entry into World War I (2003) online Sinking of American merchant ships In early 1917 Berlin forced the issue.

Compare: Five American merchant ships went down in March. Outraged public opinion now overwhelmingly supported Wilson when he asked Congress for a declaration of war on April 2, 1917. Justus D. Doenecke, Nothing Less Than War: A New History of America's Entry into World War I (2011) ch 10 Public opinion, moralism, and national interest Historians such as Ernest R. May have approached the process of American entry into the war as a study in how public opinion changed radically in three years' time. In 1914 most Americans called for neutrality, seeing the war as a dreadful mistake and were determined to stay out. By 1917 the same public felt just as strongly that going to war was both necessary and wise. Military leaders had little to say during this debate, and military considerations were seldom raised. The decisive questions dealt with morality and visions of the future. The prevailing attitude was that America possessed a superior moral position as the only great nation devoted to the principles of freedom and democracy. By staying aloof from the squabbles of reactionary empires, it could preserve those ideals‚Äîsooner or later the rest of the world would come to appreciate and adopt them. In 1917 this very long-run program faced the severe danger that in the short run powerful forces adverse to democracy and freedom would triumph. Strong support for moralism came from religious leaders, women (led by Jane Addams), and from public figures like long-time Democratic leader William Jennings Bryan, the Secretary of State from 1913 to 1916. The most important moralist of all was President Woodrow Wilson‚Äîthe man who dominated decision making so totally that the war has been labeled, from an American perspective, \\"Wilson's War\\". Poster showing German soldiers nailing a man to a tree, as American soldiers come to his rescue, 1917 In 1917 Wilson won the support of most of the moralists by proclaiming \\"a war to make the world safe for democracy.\\" If they truly believed in their ideals, he explained, now was the time to fight. The question then became whether Americans would fight for what they deeply believed in, and the answer turned out to be a resounding \\"Yes\\". Some of this attitude was mobilised by the Spirit of 1917, which evoked the Spirit of '76. Antiwar activists at the time and in the 1930s, alleged that beneath the veneer of moralism and idealism there must have been ulterior motives. Some suggested a conspiracy on the part of New York City bankers holding $3 billion of war loans to the Allies, or steel and chemical firms selling munitions to the Allies. The interpretation was popular among left- wing Progressives (led by Senator Robert La Follette of Wisconsin) and among the \\"agrarian\\" wing of the Democratic party‚Äîincluding the chairman of the tax- writing Ways and Means Committee of the House. He strenuously opposed war, and when it came he rewrote the tax laws to make sure the rich paid the most. (In the 1930s neutrality laws were passed to prevent financial entanglements from dragging the nation into a war.) In 1915, Bryan thought that Wilson's pro- British sentiments had unduly influenced his policies, so he became the first Secretary of State ever to resign in protest.Robert W. Cherny, A righteous cause: the life of William Jennings Bryan (1994) p. 144 However, historian Harold C. Syrett argues that business supported neutrality.Syrett, \\"The Business Press and American Neutrality, 1914‚Äì1917,\\" Other historians state that the pro-war element was animated not by profit but by disgust with what Germany actually did, especially in Belgium, and the threat it represented to American ideals. Belgium kept the public's sympathy as the Germans executed civilians,The German army executed over 6,500 French and Belgian civilians between August and November 1914, usually in near-random large-scale shootings of civilians ordered by junior German officers. and English nurse Edith Cavell. American engineer Herbert Hoover led a private relief effort that won wide support. Compounding the Belgium atrocities were new weapons that Americans found repugnant, like poison gas and the aerial bombardment of innocent civilians as Zeppelins dropped bombs on London. Even anti-war spokesmen did not claim that Germany was innocent, and pro-German scripts were poorly received. Randolph Bourne criticized the moralist philosophy claiming it was a justification by American intellectual and power elites, like President Wilson, for going to war unnecessarily. He argues that the push for war started with the Preparedness movement, fueled by big business. While big business would not push much further than Preparedness, benefitting the most from neutrality, the movement would eventually evolve into a war-cry, led by war-hawk intellectuals under the guise of moralism. Bourne believes elites knew full well what going to war would entail and the price in American lives it would cost. If American elites could portray the United States' role in the war as noble, they could convince the generally isolationist American public war would be acceptable.Bourne, Randolph. \\"The War and the Intellectuals.\\" N.p.: n.p., n.d. 133-46. Print. Above all, American attitudes towards Germany focused on the U-boats (submarines), which sank the Lusitania in 1915 and other passenger ships \\"without warning\\".DISASTER BEARS OUT EMBASSY'S WARNING; German Advertisement Practically Foretold Lusitania's Fate on Day She Sailed. AND IS REPEATED TODAY Passengers Also Said to Have Received Telegrams -- Shipping Men Heard of Threats.Germany, U-Boats and the LusitaniaThe Lusitania That appeared to Americans as an unacceptable challenge to America's rights as a neutral country, and as an unforgivable affront to humanity. After repeated diplomatic protests, Germany agreed to stop. But in 1917 the Germany military leadership decided that \\"military necessity\\" dictated the unrestricted use of their submarines. The Kaiser's advisors felt America was enormously powerful economically but too weak militarily to make a difference. Declaration of war Germany On April 2, 1917, Wilson asked a special joint session of Congress to declare war on the German Empire, stating, \\"We have no selfish ends to serve\\".for detailed coverage of the speech see NY Times main headline, April 2, 1917, President Calls for War Declaration, Stronger Navy, New Army of 500,000 Men, Full Cooperation With Germany's Foes To make the conflict seem like a better idea, he painted the conflict idealistically, stating that the war would \\"make the world safe for democracy\\" and later that it would be a \\"war to end war\\". The United States had a moral responsibility to enter the war, Wilson proclaimed. The future of the world was being determined on the battlefield, and American national interest demanded a voice. Wilson's definition of the situation won wide acclaim, and, indeed, has shaped America's role in world and military affairs ever since. Wilson believed that if the Central Powers won, the consequences would be bad for the United States. Germany would have dominated the continent and perhaps would gain control of the seas as well. Latin America could well have fallen under Berlin's control. The dream of spreading democracy, liberalism, and independence would have been shattered. On the other hand, if the Allies had won without help, there was a danger they would carve up the world without regard to American commercial interests. They were already planning to use government subsidies, tariff walls, and controlled markets to counter the competition posed by American businessmen. The solution was a third route, a \\"peace without victory\\", according to Wilson.John Milton Cooper, Jr., Woodrow Wilson: A Biography (2011) pp. 383‚Äì89 On April 6, 1917, Congress declared war. In the Senate, the resolution passed 82 to 6, with Senators Harry Lane, William J. Stone, James Vardaman, Asle Gronna, Robert M. La Follette, Sr., and George W. Norris voting against it. In the House, the declaration passed 373 to 50, with Claude Kitchin, a senior Democrat, notably opposing it. Another opponent was Jeannette Rankin, who alone voted against entry into both World War I and World War II. Nearly all of the opposition came from the West and the Midwest. Austria-Hungary The United States Senate, in a 74 to 0 vote, declared war on Austria-Hungary on December 7, 1917, citing Austria- Hungary's severing of diplomatic relations with the United States, its use of unrestricted submarine warfare and its alliance with Germany.H.J.Res.169: Declaration of War with Austria-Hungary, WWI, United States Senate The declaration passed in the United States House of Representatives by a vote of 365 to 1. President Wilson also came under pressure from Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, and from former President Theodore Roosevelt, who demanded a declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria, as Germany's allies. President Wilson drafted a statement to Congress in December 1917 which said \\"I... recommend that Congress immediately declare the United States in a state of war with Austria-Hungary, with Turkey and with Bulgaria\\". However, after further consultations, the decision to go to war against Germany's other allies was postponed.

The film features Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson investigating the fears of a young woman and the suspicious death of her sister.  Plot summary  The film begins on the Rylott estate with gypsies camping on the grounds. Inside the mansion, Violet Stonor screams in her bedroom and then collapses in the hallway. She is discovered by her sister, Helen (Angela Baddeley). Violet's dying words are \\"the band, speckled.\\" She then dies and their stepfather, Dr. Grimesby Rylott (Lyn Harding), arrives. Soon there is an inquest into the mysterious death, and Rylott plots with the housekeeper and his Indian servant, Ali. Watson attends the inquest as an old friend of the Stonor family in India. He acts protectively to Helen and advises her to consult Holmes if she ever feels in danger. At Baker Street later, Watson summarises the inquest to Holmes, describing the various witnesses and evidence. Holmes files it away in his system--he operates a modern office with female secretaries and a voice recording device. One year later, Helen Stonor is engaged, and her fianc√© must leave for a plantation in Rangoon for a year. Helen is afraid and suggests that they marry sooner, so that she may go with him to Rangoon. Dr. Rylott is upset by these plans and decides to murder her to prevent the loss of her inheritance. Rylott forces Helen to move from her room into Violet's old room. The next day, Helen meets with Holmes and Watson in Baker Street they describe her case. Her sister Violet had been engaged to be married before she dies, and Helen remembers hearing mysterious music that night. Now Helen is engaged and is also hearing the mysterious music again. Holmes questions her and sends her out of the room through a separate entrance when her stepfather arrives. Dr. Rylott barges in and threatens Holmes, but he is not deterred. In the afternoon, Dr. Watson arrives alone to visit Helen Stonor while her stepfather is not home. Holmes is in disguise as a workman dealing with the repairs to the building. Together they investigate Dr. Rylott's room and discover several clues, such as a bowl of milk, a dog whip, and a mirror. Next, they investigate Violet's room, which has a bell-rope that doesn't ring and a ventilator near the bed. The ventilator opens into Rylott's room but is hidden by a painting. When Rylott returns, Holmes and Watson temporarily leave Helen at the house but plan to sneak into the room later to investigate. That night, Helen spends the night within Violet's room while Holmes and Watson secretly keep watch with her. After snake-charming music plays, a snake enters the room through the ventilator, and Holmes attacks it, sending it back to Rylott's room. Rylott screams. Holmes, Watson, and Helen enter his room and discover Rylott dead from a snake bite. Holmes forces Ali, the servant, to charm the snake so they can put it in the safe. Violet's last words about a \\"speckled band\\" were in fact describing \\"a swamp adder, the deadliest snake in India\\". The venomous snake had been sent to Violet's room by Dr. Rylott to murder her for her inheritance. Rylott had intended to do the same to Helen. The movie ends with Holmes conducting an experiment in Baker Street. Watson arrives dressed for a wedding, and Holmes therefore deduces that he is going to a wedding. Watson is pleased to tell Holmes that he is wrong, that he has just come from the wedding of Helen Stonor and her groom. Holmes offers his \\"condolences\\" rather than congratulations. Watson says in amusement that \\"we all come to it\\", meaning marriage. After Watson leaves, Holmes disagrees quietly, \\"Not all, my dear Watson... not all\\".

Using Conan Doyle's play as the source, some character names differ from the original short story; the story's Roylott becomes Rylott, Julia Stoner becomes Violet Stonor. Some characters appeared in the play and film that weren't in the original story such as Mrs. Staunton the housekeeper, Rodgers the butler, and the Indian servant Ali. The film also altered the famous address of 221B Baker Street to 107 Baker Street and makes it a state- of-the-art office complete with secretaries and stenographers.  Reception  Vincent Starrett found Massey's performance lacking saying \\"Mr. Massey as Sherlock Holmes, in The Speckled Band, most famous perhaps of all the Holmes adventures, was a considerable disappointment.\\" Starrett felt that Massey didn't at all look the part opining \\"he looked like almost any nice, young, brown-haired college boy, wrapped in a dormitory dressing gown, smoking a bulldog pipe.\\" Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times disagreed saying \\"Mr. Massey's performance is pleasing, intelligent and restrained\\" and said of the film \\"The Speckled Band succeeds in being moderately interesting.\\" References  External links  * 1931 films British black-and-white films British films British crime drama films Detective films English-language films 1931 romantic drama films Sherlock Holmes films based on works by Arthur Conan Doyle 1930s thriller films Films set in London Films set in England Films directed by Jack Raymond British and Dominions Studios films 1931 drama films ","title":"The Speckled Band (1931 film)"},{"id":"25162949","text":"Ammonium fluorosilicate (also known as ammonium hexafluorosilicate, ammonium fluosilicate or ammonium silicofluoride) has the formula (NH4)2SiF6. It is a toxic chemical, like all salts of fluorosilicic acid.Wiberg, E., Wiberg, N., and Holleman, A. F. (2001) Inorganic chemistry. Academic Press, San Diego. It is made of white crystals, which have at least three polymorphs and appears in nature as rare minerals cryptohalite or bararite. Structure  Ammonium fluorosilicate has three major polymorphs: Œ±-(NH4)2[SiF6] form is cubic (space group Fm _3_ m, No. 225) and corresponds to the mineral cryptohalite. The Œ≤ form is trigonal (scalenohedral) and occurs in nature as mineral bararite. A third (Œ≥) form was discovered in 2001 and identified with the hexagonal 6mm symmetry. In all three configurations, the [SiF6]2‚àí octahedra are arranged in layers. In the Œ± form, these layers are perpendicular to [111] directions. In the Œ≤- and Œ≥- forms, the layers are perpendicular to the c-axis. (Note: trigonal symmetry is part of the hexagonal group, but not all hexagonal crystals are trigonal.Klein, C. and Dutrow, B. (2008) The 23rd Edition of the Manual of Mineral Science. John Wiley & Sons, Hoboken, NJ.) The silicon atoms of Œ±-(NH4)2[SiF6] (alpha), have cubic close packing (CCP). The Œ≥ form has hexagonal close packing and the Œ≤-(NH4)2[SiF6] has primitive hexagonal packing.To learn about the primitive hexagonal structure, see Primitive hexagonal packing . In all three phases, 12 fluorine atoms neighbor the (NH4)+. Although bararite was claimed to be metastable at room temperature, it does not appear one polymorph has ever turned into another. Still, bararite is fragile enough that grinding it for spectroscopy will produce a little cryptohalite.Oxton, I. A., Knop, O., and Falk, M. (1975) \\"Infrared Spectra of the Ammonium Ion in Crystals\\". II. The Ammonium Ion in Trigonal Environments, with a Consideration of Hydrogen Bonding. Canadian Journal of Chemistry, 53, 3394‚Äì3400. Even so, ammonium fluorosilicate assumes a trigonal form at pressures of 0.2 to 0.3 GPa. The reaction is irreversible. If it is not bararite, the phase is at least very closely related. The hydrogen bonding in (NH4)2[SiF6] allows this salt to change phases in ways that normal salts cannot. Interactions between cations and anions are especially important in how ammonium salts change phase. (To learn more about the Œ≤-structure, see Bararite.) Natural occurrence This chemical makes rare appearances in nature.Barnes, J. and Lapham, D. (1971) \\"Rare Minerals Found in Pennsylvania\\". Pennsylvania Geology, 2, 5, 6‚Äì8. It is found as a sublimation product of fumaroles and coal fires. As a mineral, it is either called cryptohalite or bararite, the two being two polymorphs of the compound.Anthony, J. W., Bideaux, R.

Mineral Data Publishing, Tucson. *link to bararite *link to cryptohalite Chemical properties and health hazards Ammonium fluorosilicate is noncombustible, but it will still release dangerous fumes in a fire, including hydrogen fluoride, silicon tetrafluoride, and nitrogen oxides. It will corrode aluminium. In water, ammonium fluorosilicate dissolves to form an acid solution. Inhaling dust can lead to pulmonary irritation, possibly death. Ingestion may also prove fatal. Irritation of the eyes comes from contact with the dust, as well as irritation or ulceration of the skin. Uses Ammonium fluorosilicate finds use as a disinfectant, and it is useful in etching glass, metal casting, and electroplating.Ammonium fuorosilicate, CAMEO Chemicals, NOAA It is also used to help neutralize washing machine water as laundry sour.

They can be harnessed as a genetic tool for analysis of gene and protein function. The use of transposons is well- developed in Drosophila (in which P elements are most commonly used) and in Thale cress (Arabidopsis thaliana) and bacteria such as Escherichia coli (E. coli ). Currently transposons can be used in genetic research and recombinant genetic engineering for insertional mutagenesis. Insertional mutagenesis is when transposons function as vectors to help remove and integrate genetic sequences. Given their relatively simple design and inherent ability to move DNA sequences, transposons are highly compatible at transducing genetic material, making them ideal genetic tools. Signature-Tagging Mutagenesis Signature-tagging mutagenesis (also known as STM) is a technique focused on using transposable element insertion to determine the phenotype of a locus in an organism's genome. While genetic sequencing techniques can determine the genotype of a genome, they cannot determine the function or phenotypic expression of gene sequences. STM can bypass this issue by mutating a locus, causing it form a new phenotype; by comparing the observed phenotypic expressions of the mutated and unaltered locus, one can deduce the phenotypic expression of the locus. In STM, specially tagged transposons are inserted into an organism, such as a bacterium, and randomly integrated into the host genome. In theory, the modified mutant organism should express the altered gene, thus altering the phenotype. If a new phenotype is observed, the genome is sequenced and searched for tagged transposons. If the site of transposon integration is found, then the locus may be responsible for expressing the phenotypes. There have been many studies conducted transposon based STM, most notably with the P elements in Drosophila. P elements are transposons originally described in Drosophila melanogaster genome capable of being artificially synthesized or spread to other Drosophila species through horizontal transfer. In experimental trials, artificially created P elements and transposase genes are inserted into the genomes of Drosophila embryos. Subsequently, embryos that exhibit mutations have their genomes sequenced and compared, thus revealing the loci that have been affected by insertion and the roles of the loci., Insertional Inactivation Insertional inactivation focuses on suppressing the expression of a gene by disrupting its sequence with an insertion. When additional nucleotides are inserted near or into a locus, the locus can suffer a frameshift mutation that could prevent it from being properly expressed into polypeptide chain. Transposon-based Insertional inactivation is considered for medical research from suppression of antibiotic resistance in bacteria to the treatment of genetic diseases. In the treatment of genetic diseases, the insertion of a transposon into deleterious gene locus of organism's genome would misalign the locus sequence, truncating any harmful proteins formed and rendering them non-functional. Alternatively insertional inactivation could be used to suppress genes that express antibiotic- resistance in bacteria., Sleeping Beauty While transposons have been used successfully in plants and invertebrate subjects through insertional mutagenesis and insertional activation, the usage of transposons in vertebrates has been limited due to a lack of transposons specific to vertebrates. Nearly all transposons compatible to and present within vertebrate genomes are inactive and are often relegated to \\"junk\\" DNA. However it is possible to identify dormant transposons and artificially recreate them as active agents. Genetic researchers Zsuzsanna Izsv√°k and Zolt√°n Ivics discovered a fish transposon sequence that, despite being dormant for 15 million years, could be resurrected as a vector for introducing foreign genes into the vertebrate genomes, including those of humans. This transposon, called Sleeping Beauty was described in 1997, and could be artificially reactivated into a functioning transposon. Sleeping Beauty can also be viable in gene therapy procedures by helping introduce beneficial transgenes into host genomes. Belcher et al. tested this notion by using Sleeping Beauty transposons to help insert sequences into mice with sickle cell anemia so they can produce the enzymes need to counteract their anemia. Belcher et al. began their experiment by constructing a genetic sequence consisting of the Hmox-1 transposable element and transposase from Sleeping Beauty. This sequence was then added inserted into a plasmid and introduced into the cells of the mice. The transposase from Sleeping Beauty helped insert the Hmox-1 transposon into the mice genome, allowing the production of enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). The mice that receive the insertion showed a fivefold increase in the expression of HO-1, which in turn reduced blood vessel blockage from sickle- cell anemia. The publication of the experiment in 2010 showed that transposons can be useful in gene therapy. P Elements as a tool (Drosophila) Naturally occurring P elements contain: :* coding sequence for the enzyme transposase; :* recognition sequences for transposase action. Transposase is an enzyme which regulates and catalyzes the excision of a P element from the host DNA, cutting at two recognition sites, and then reinserts the P element randomly. It is the random-insertion process, that can interfere with existing genes, or carry an additional gene, that can be used as a process for genetic research. To use this process as a useful and controllable genetic tool, the two parts of the P element must be separated to prevent uncontrolled transposition. The normal genetic tools are therefore: * DNA coding for transposase (or occasionally simply transposase) with no transposase recognition sequences so it cannot insert; and * a \\"P Plasmid\\". P Plasmids always contain: :* a Drosophila reporter gene, often a red-eye marker (the product of the white gene); :* transposase recognition sequences; and may contain: :* a gene of interest; :* an E. coli reporter gene (often some kind of antibiotic resistance); and :* origin of replication and other associated plasmid 'housekeeping' sequences. Methods of usage (Drosophila) (Forward genetics methods) There are two main ways to utilise these tools: Fly Transformation, and Insertional Mutagenesis, each described below. =Fly Transformation= (hoping for insertion in non-coding regions) #Microinject the posterior end of an early-stage (pre-cellularization) embryo with coding for transposase and a plasmid with the reporter gene, gene of interest and transposase recognition sequences. #Random transposition occurs, inserting the gene of interest and reporter gene. #Grow flies and cross to remove genetic variation between the cells of the organism. (Only some of the cells of the organism will have been transformed. By breeding only the genotype of the gametes is passed on, removing this variation). #Look for flies expressing the reporter gene. These carry the inserted gene of interest, so can be investigated to determine the phenotype due to the gene of interest. It is important to note that the inserted gene may have damaged the function of one of the host's genes. Several lines of flies are required so comparison can take place and ensure that no additional genes have been knocked out. =Insertional Mutagenesis= (hoping for insertion in coding region) #Microinject the embryo with coding for transposase and a plasmid with the reporter gene and transposase recognition sequences (and often the E. coli reporter gene and origin of replication, etc.). #Random transposition occurs, inserting the reporter gene randomly. The insertion tends to occur near actively transcribed genes, as this is where the chromatin structure is loosest, so the DNA most accessible. #Grow flies and cross to remove genetic variation between the cells of the organism (see above). #Look for flies expressing the reporter gene. These have experienced a successful transposition, so can be investigated to determine the phenotype due to mutation of existing genes. Possible mutations: #Insertion in a translated region => hybrid protein/truncated protein. Usually causes loss of protein function, although more complex effects are seen. #Insertion in an intron => altered splicing pattern/splicing failure. Usually results in protein truncation or the production of inactive mis-spliced products, although more complex effects are common. #Insertion in 5' (the sequence that will become the mRNA 5' UTR) untranslated region => truncation of transcript. Usually results in failure of the mRNA to contain a 5' cap, leading to less efficient translation. #Insertion in promoter => reduction/complete loss of expression. Always results in greatly reduced protein production levels. The most useful type of insertion for analysis due to the simplicity of the situation. #Insertion between promoter and upstream enhancers => loss of enhancer function/hijack of enhancer function for reporter gene.‚Ä† Generally reduces the level of protein specificity to cell type, although complex effects are often seen. ‚Ä† Enhancer trapping The hijack of an enhancer from another gene allows the analysis of the function of that enhancer. This, especially if the reporter gene is for a fluorescent protein, can be used to help map expression of the mutated gene through the organism, and is a very powerful tool. Other usage of P Elements (Drosophila) (Reverse genetics method) =Secondary mobilisation= If there is an old P element near the gene of interest (with a broken transposase) you can remobilise by microinjection of the embryo with coding for transposase or transposase itself. The P element will often transpose within a few kilobases of the original location, hopefully affecting your gene of interest as for 'Insertional Mutagenisis'. Analysis of Mutagenesis Products (Drosophila) Once the function of the mutated protein has been determined it is possible to sequence/purify/clone the regions flanking the insertion by the following methods: =Inverse PCR= Process of analysis of DNA flanking a known insert by PCR. #Isolate the fly genome. #Undergo a light digest (using an enzyme [enzyme 1] known NOT to cut in the reporter gene), giving fragments of a few kilobases, a few with the insertion and its flanking DNA. #Self ligate the digest (low DNA concentration to ensure self ligation) giving a selection of circular DNA fragments, a few with the insertion and its flanking DNA. #Cut the plasmids at some point in the reporter gene (with an enzyme [enzyme 2] known to cut very rarely in genomic DNA, but is known to in the reporter gene). #Using primers for the reporter gene sections, the DNA can be amplified for sequencing. The process of cutting, self ligation and re cutting allows the amplification of the flanking regions of DNA without knowing the sequence. The point at which the ligation occurred can be seen by identifying the cut site of [enzyme 1]. =Plasmid Rescue (E. coli Transformation)= Process of analysis of DNA flanking a known insert by plasmid rescue. #Isolate the fly genome. #Undergo a light digest (using an enzyme [enzyme 1] known to cut in the boundary between the reporter gene and the E. coli reporter gene and plasmid sequences), giving fragments of a few kilobases, a few with the E. coli reporter, the plasmid sequences and its flanking DNA. #Self ligate the digest (low DNA concentration to ensure self ligation) giving a selection of circular DNA fragments, a few with the E. coli reporter, the plasmid sequences and its flanking DNA. #Insert the plasmids into E. coli cells (e.g. by electroporation). #Screen plasmids for the E. coli reporter gene. Only successful inserts of plasmids with the plasmid 'housekeeping' sequences will express this gene. 7\\\\. The gene can be cloned for further analysis. Transposable Element Application Other organisms The genomes of other organisms can be analysed in a similar way, although with different transposable elements. The recent discovery of the 'mariner transposon' (from the reconstruction of the original sequence from many 'dead' versions in the human genome) has allowed many new experiments, mariner has well conserved homologues across a wide range of species and is a very versatile tool.

It originally aired on NBC in the United States on November 19, 2009. In the episode, Leslie tries to prove she can hang out with the guys by attending Ron's annual hunting trip, where Ron is accidentally shot. The episode was written by Daniel J. Goor and was directed by series co-creator Greg Daniels. It also introduced a romantic subplot between the characters Andy and April which continued throughout the second season and into the third. Series co-creator Michael Schur said the pairing was not previously planned, but grew when it was discovered actors Aubrey Plaza and Chris Pratt had strong comedic chemistry together. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Hunting Trip\\" was seen by 4.61 million viewers, a slight drop from the previous week's episode, \\"The Camel\\". The episode received generally positive to mixed reviews, with commentators particularly praising the Andy and April subplot, as well as the continued development of Leslie Knope's character. Plot The episode opens with Andy (Chris Pratt) giving piggyback rides to everyone in the parks department. Later, Ron (Nick Offerman), Jerry (Jim O'Heir) and Mark (Paul Schneider) look forward to their annual \\"trail survey\\", which is actually a yearly secret hunting trip. Determined to prove she can be just like one of the guys around the office, Leslie insists the ladies of the parks department attend the trip this year, as well as Tom (Aziz Ansari), who has also never been invited. Ron is visibly disappointed. Leslie asks April (Aubrey Plaza) to check on a budgeting request while they are gone. What should be a simple chore, however, has April waiting on hold at the phone for hours. When she desperately has to use the restroom, Andy agrees to wait by the phone. When she returns, the two start to bond by making up their own lyrics to the hold music, playing a non-water game of Marco Polo around the office, and seeing who can make the best spit-take. When Andy says he is jealous that his ex-girlfriend Ann (Rashida Jones) is going to the hunting trip with Mark, April offers to give him a hickey to make Ann jealous, which Andy accepts. Meanwhile, the others arrive at the cabin for the hunting trip. Leslie (Amy Poehler) proves to be an excellent hunter and bags the first quail. Growing increasingly threatened, Ron agrees to a challenge that Leslie cannot shoot more birds than he can, and they split up. After a few hours of hunting, Ron screams and the others rush to his side and find he has been shot in the head, with the gun also shooting out the window of Donna's Mercedes. Ann takes Ron back to the cabin, where he is absolutely furious even though the injury is not serious. Ron asks whether Leslie shot him, but she insists she did not. Ron takes several pain pills and washes it down with scotch, which forces Ann and Leslie to hold his mouth open and induce vomiting, despite fierce opposition from Ron himself. The others discuss who shot Ron, and Tom creates a minor panic when he suggests perhaps an outsider is hunting them. Ann takes Leslie aside and says she knows who shot Ron, and a few minutes later Leslie admits to the group that she was the shooter, even though Ann knows this is not the case. A park ranger (Jay Johnston) arrives and interrogates Leslie, implying that the accident is the result of her femininity. Leslie knows that she is a good hunter, but goes along with the ranger's sexist implications in order to appease him. Later, a bandaged Ron repeatedly berates Leslie, prompting Ann to insist Tom come forward. Tom admits he shot Ron, and that Leslie covered for him because he did not have his hunting license, which could have resulted in a $25,000 fine and prison time. Ron is impressed with Leslie, whom he calls a \\"stand-up guy\\". The episode ends with a get well party for Ron, where Ann is unimpressed with Andy's hickey, and the whole party is horrified by Ron's head wound. Production \\"Hunting Trip\\" was written by Daniel J. Goor and directed by series co-creator Greg Daniels. The episode introduced a romantic subplot between the characters Andy and April which continued throughout the second season and into the third. Series co-creator Michael Schur said the pairing was not previously planned, but grew when it was discovered during the filming of \\"Hunting Trip\\" that actors Aubrey Plaza and Chris Pratt had strong comedic chemistry together. However, Schur also said the idea to pair them together in \\"Hunting Trip\\" stemmed in part from a line Plaza improvised in the first season finale \\"Rock Show\\", when Andy explained his style of music and April replied that she completely understood him. Schur said, \\"At the time, it was this little nothing, throwaway thing, but when we watched it, we thought there might be something there.\\" During a November 2009 panel at the Paley Center for Media in New York City, Plaza said, \\"You're going to see more scenes with Andy and April. There could be a love connection for them.\\" Daniels said some of his favorite moments from the series were in \\"Hunting Trip\\" and he particularly loved the \\"interpersonal stuff\\" between Andy and April, who he described as \\"two characters that you didn't know had any interest in one another\\". Pratt specifically sought to make Plaza laugh during their scene together and was ultimately successful. He told Daniels before filming, \\"I'm gonna get something out of her.\\" \\"Hunting Trip\\" included a scene in which Leslie tells the state trooper multiple reasons or excuses for why she apparently shot Ron, all of which were edited together in a series of jump cuts. The technique has been commonly used throughout the Parks and Recreation series to condense multiple takes of improvisation from Poehler. Reception In its original American broadcast on November 19, 2009, \\"Hunting Trip\\" was seen by 4.61 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. \\"Hunting Trip\\" drew a 2.0 rating/6 share among viewers aged between 18 and 49. It constituted about a five percent drop in viewership from the previous week's episode, \\"The Camel\\", which itself was a five percent drop from the previous episode, \\"Ron and Tammy\\". The episode received generally positive reviews, with several particularly praising the subplot between Aubrey Plaza and Chris Pratt. Reviewers also praised the continued developed of the Leslie Knope character, who proves to be intelligent and capable in \\"Hunting Trip\\", rather than the clueless protagonist she appeared to be in earlier episodes. In 2011, New York magazine writer called it \\"one of the breakout episodes that saw the show finding its momentum and figuring out how to transfer the dynamic outside of the office\\". Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said \\"Hunting Trip\\" was not as funny as the previous episode, \\"The Camel\\", but that it included excellent physical comedy like Ron's refusal to throw up, and Andy's piggyback rides throughout Pawnee town hall. Sepinwall also praised Leslie's intelligence and savvy, which he said differentiates the show from Greg Daniels' other show, The Office and its protagonist Michael Scott. IGN writer Matt Fowler particularly praised the pairing of Aubrey Plaza and Chris Pratt, which he called simultaneously funny, naturalistic and sweet. Fowler said the main hunting plot was funny, but \\"I'm not a huge fan of horrific personal injury as a vehicle for humor\\". Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club said he liked the episode, but that the main hunting subplot was messy because there was too much action involving too many supporting cast members. Heisler said the Andy and April subplot was more effective. Slate magazine writer Jonah Weiner praised \\"Hunting Trip\\", especially the scene in which the characters become convinced they are being stalked by the Predator, the alien antagonist from the 1987 film of the same name. Weiner called it a \\"detour into an inspired absurdity that tugs against and tweaks the show's bureaucratic backdrop\\". Time magazine television critic James Poniewozik said \\"Hunting Trip\\" demonstrated how far Leslie Knope had developed since the first season. Poniewozik praised the \\"ultra-deadpan\\" pairing of Andy and April, which he said was another in a continued line of \\"interesting combinations for its side players\\". Steve Penner of The Portsmouth Herald said the sequence of Poehler's statements to the park trooper was \\"worthy of her absolutely best SNL impressions\\". DVD release \\"Hunting Trip\\", along with the other 23 second season episodes of Parks and Recreation, was released on a four-disc DVD set in the United States on November 30, 2010. The DVD also included deleted scenes from each episode. It also included a commentary track for \\"Hunting Trip\\" featuring Amy Poehler, Nick Offerman, Aziz Ansari, Rashida Jones, Chris Pratt, Jim O'Heir, Retta, Aubrey Plaza, Michael Schur and Greg Daniels. \\"Hunting Trip\\" was also included in the DVD box-set for the sixth season of The Office.

Each half of the chromosome replicated by one replication fork is called a \\"replichore\\". (Graphic computer art by Daniel Yuen) A circular chromosome is a chromosome in bacteria, archaea, mitochondria, and chloroplasts, in the form of a molecule of circular DNA, unlike the linear chromosome of most eukaryotes. Most prokaryote chromosomes contain a circular DNA molecule ‚Äì there are no free ends to the DNA. Free ends would otherwise create significant challenges to cells with respect to DNA replication and stability. Cells that do contain chromosomes with DNA ends, or telomeres (most eukaryotes), have acquired elaborate mechanisms to overcome these challenges. However, a circular chromosome can provide other challenges for cells. After replication, the two progeny circular chromosomes can sometimes remain interlinked or tangled, and they must be resolved so that each cell inherits one complete copy of the chromosome during cell division.  Replication  Bidirectional replication in a circular chromosome. The circular bacteria chromosome replication is best understood in the well-studied bacteria Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. Chromosome replication proceeds in three major stages: initiation, elongation and termination. The initiation stage starts with the ordered assembly of \\"initiator\\" proteins at the origin region of the chromosome, called oriC. These assembly stages are regulated to ensure that chromosome replication occurs only once in each cell cycle. During the elongation phase of replication, the enzymes that were assembled at oriC during initiation proceed along each arm (\\"replichore\\") of the chromosome, in opposite directions away from the oriC, replicating the DNA to create two identical copies. This process is known as bidirectional replication. The entire assembly of molecules involved in DNA replication on each arm is called a \\"replisome.\\" At the forefront of the replisome is a DNA helicase that unwinds the two strands of DNA, creating a moving \\"replication fork\\". The two unwound single strands of DNA serve as templates for DNA polymerase, which moves with the helicase (together with other proteins) to synthesise a complementary copy of each strand. In this way, two identical copies of the original DNA are created. Eventually, the two replication forks moving around the circular chromosome meet in a specific zone of the chromosome, approximately opposite oriC, called the terminus region. The elongation enzymes then disassemble, and the two \\"daughter\\" chromosomes are resolved before cell division is completed.  Initiation  The E. coli bacterial replication origin, called oriC consists of DNA sequences that are recognised by the DnaA protein, which is highly conserved amongst different bacterial species. DnaA binding to the origin initiates the regulated recruitment of other enzymes and proteins that will eventually lead to the establishment of two complete replisomes for bidirectional replication.Jon M. Kaguni DnaA: Controlling the Initiation of Bacterial DNA Replication and More. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2006. 60:351‚Äì71 DNA sequence elements within oriC that are important for its function include DnaA boxes, a 9-mer repeat with a highly conserved consensus sequence 5' ‚Äì TTATCCACA ‚Äì 3',C Weigel, A Schmidt, B R√ºckert, R Lurz, and W Messer.

Cell, 50, 259‚Äì265 This region also contains four ‚ÄúGATC‚Äù sequences that are recognized by DNA adenine methylase (Dam), an enzyme that modifies the adenine base when this sequence is unmethylated or hemimethylated. The methylation of adenines is important as it alters the conformation of DNA to promote strand separation,Gotoh O, Tagashira Y. 1981.

The interaction between helicase and primase sets the replication fork clock. J. Biol. Chem. 271:21398‚Äì405 In order for DNA replication to continue, single stranded binding proteins are needed to prevent the single strands of DNA from forming secondary structures and to prevent them from re-annealing. In addition, DNA gyrase is needed to relieve the topological stress created by the action of DnaB helicase.  Elongation  When the replication fork moves around the circle, a structure shaped like the Greek letter theta ”® is formed. John Cairns demonstrated the theta structure of E. coli chromosomal replication in 1963, using an innovative method to visualize DNA replication. In his experiment, he radioactively labeled the chromosome by growing his cultures in a medium containing 3H-thymidine. The nucleoside base was incorporated uniformly into the bacterial chromosome. He then isolated the chromosomes by lysing the cells gently and placed them on an electron micrograph (EM) grid which he exposed to X-ray film for two months. This Experiment clearly demonstrates the theta replication model of circular bacterial chromosomes.Cairns, J.P.: Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology 28:44, 1963. * See Autoradiograph of intact replicating chromosome of E.coli As described above, bacterial chromosomal replication occurs in a bidirectional manner. This was first demonstrated by specifically labelling replicating bacterial chromosomes with radioactive isotopes. The regions of DNA undergoing replication during the experiment were then visualized by using autoradiography and examining the developed film microscopically. This allowed the researchers to see where replication was taking place. The first conclusive observations of bidirectional replication was from studies of B. subtilis.Wake, R.G. 1972. Visualization of reinitiated chromosomes in Bacillus subtilis. J Mol Biol. Jul 28;68(3):501-9. Shortly after, the E. coli chromosome was also shown to replicate bidirectionally.Prescott D.M., Kuempel P.L. 1972. Bidirectional replication of the chromosome in Escherichia coli. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. Oct;69(10):2842-5. * See Figure 4 of D. M. Prescott, and P. L.

The E. coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme is a 900 kD complex, possessing an essentially a dimeric structure. Each monomeric unit has a catalytic core, a dimerization subunit, and a processivity component .O'Donnell M., Jeruzalmi D., Kuriyan J. Clamp loader structure predicts the architecture of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme and RFC. Curr. Biol. 11 R935-R946 2001 DNA Pol III uses one set of its core subunits to synthesize the leading strand continuously, while the other set of core subunits cycles from one Okazaki fragment to the next on the looped lagging strand. Leading strand synthesis begins with the synthesis of a short RNA primer at the replication origin by the enzyme Primase (DnaG protein). Deoxynucleotides are then added to this primer by a single DNA polymerase III dimer, in an integrated complex with DnaB helicase. Leading strand synthesis then proceeds continuously, while the DNA is concurrently unwound at the replication fork. In contrast, lagging strand synthesis is accomplished in short Okazaki fragments. First, an RNA primer is synthesized by primase, and, like that in leading strand synthesis, DNA Pol III binds to the RNA primer and adds deoxyribonucleotides. When the synthesis of an Okazaki fragment has been completed, replication halts and the core subunits of DNA Pol III dissociates from the Œ≤ sliding clamp [B sliding clap is the processivity subunit of DNA Pol III].Indiani C, O'Donnell M. Mechanism of the delta wrench in opening the beta sliding clamp. J Biol Chem. 2003 Oct 10;278(41):40272-81. Epub 2003 Jul 8. The RNA primer is removed and replaced with DNA by DNA polymerase I [which also possesses proofreading exonuclease activity] and the remaining nick is sealed by DNA ligase, which then ligates these fragments to form the lagging strand. A substantial proportion (10-15%) of the replication forks originating at oriC encounter a DNA damage or strand break when cells are grown under normal laboratory conditions (without an exogenous DNA damaging treatment). The encountered DNA damages are ordinarily processed by recombinational repair enzymes to allow continued replication fork progression.  Termination  Most circular bacterial chromosomes are replicated bidirectionally, starting at one point of origin and replicating in two directions away from the origin. This results in semiconservative replication, in which each new identical DNA molecule contains one template strand from the original molecule, shown as the solid lines, and one new strand, shown as the dotted lines. Termination is the process of fusion of replication forks and disassembly of the replisomes to yield two separate and complete DNA molecules. It occurs in the terminus region, approximately opposite oriC on the chromosome (Fig 5). The terminus region contains several DNA replication terminator sites, or \\"Ter\\" sites. A special \\"replication terminator\\" protein must be bound at the Ter site for it to pause replication. Each Ter site has polarity of action, that is, it will arrest a replication fork approaching the Ter site from one direction, but will allow unimpeded fork movement through the Ter site from the other direction. The arrangement of the Ter sites forms two opposed groups that forces the two forks to meet each other within the region they span. This arrangement is called the \\"replication fork trap.\\"Duggin IG, Wake RG, Bell SD, Hill TM. 2008. The replication fork trap and termination of chromosome replication. Mol Microbiol.

(B) A cross-sectional view of the helicase-arresting surface. Replication of the DNA separating the opposing replication forks, leaves the completed chromosomes joined as ‚Äòcatenanes‚Äô or topologically interlinked circles. The circles are not covalently linked, but cannot be separated because they are interwound and each is covalently closed. The catenated circles require the action of topoisomerases to separate the circles [decatanation]. In E.coli, DNA topoisomerase IV plays the major role in the separation of the catenated chromosomes, transiently breaking both DNA strands of one chromosome and allowing the other chromosome to pass through the break. There has been some confusion about the role DNA gyrase plays in decatenation. To define the nomenclature, there are two types of topoisomerases: type I produces transient single-strand breaks in DNA and types II produces transient double-strand breaks. As a result, the type I enzyme removes supercoils from DNA one at a time, whereas the type II enzyme removes supercoils two at a time. The topo I of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes are the type I topoisomerase. The eukaryotic topo II, bacterial gyrase, and bacterial topo IV belong to the type II. We often forget that DNA gyrase does in fact have topoisomerase type II activity; thus, with it being a homologue of topoisomerase IV (also having topoisomerase II activity) we expect similarity in the two proteins' functions. DNA gyrase preliminary role is to introduce negative super coils into DNA, thereby relaxing positive supercoils that come into play during DNA replication. Topoisomerase IV also relaxes positive supercoils, therefore, DNA Gyrase and topoisomerase IV play an almost identical role in removing the positive supercoils ahead of a translocating DNA polymerase, allowing DNA replication to continue unhindered by topological strain.Chris Ullsperger and Nicholas R. Cozzarelli. Contrasting Enzymatic Activities of Topoisomerase IV and DNA Gyrase from Escherichia coli. Volume 271, Number 49, Issue of December 6, 1996, pp. 31549-31555 Confusion arises when some scientific literature state that DNA gyrase is the sole enzyme responsible for decatanation. In an experiment conducted by Zechiedrich, Khodursky and Cozzarelli in 1997, it was found that topoisomerase IV is the only important decatenase of DNA replication intermediates in bacteria.E L Zechiedrich, A B Khodursky, N R Cozzarelli. Topoisomerase IV, not gyrase, decatenates products of site-specific recombination in Escherichia coli. Genes Dev. 1997 Oct 1;11 (19):2580-92 9334322 In this particular experiment, when DNA gyrase alone were inhibited, most of the catenanes were unlinked. However, when Topoisomerase IV alone was inhibited, decatenation was almost completely blocked. The results obtained suggest that Topoisomerase IV is the primary decatenase in vivo, and although DNA gyrase does play a role in decatenation, its function is not as essential as topoisomerase IV in the decatentation of interlinked chromosomes.

The E-P2 succeeds the Olympus Pen E-P1 a little over five months after the introduction of the EP-1. Features The EP-2 addresses some of the concerns that critics had about the EP-1, notably, slow autofocus speed and difficulty seeing the LCD panel under certain (e.g., bright, sunny) conditions. The autofocus speed was addressed with a firmware update, and the introduction of new lenses, although critically, the autofocus speed does not improve much with the originally issued 14‚Äì42 mm ∆í/3.5‚Äì5.6 kit zoom lens (28‚Äì90 mm equivalent), or the 17 mm ∆í/2.8 (34 mm equivalent) pancake lens. The EP-2 added an Accessory Port, a power and communication port, which allowed the use of various accessories, such as an external stereo microphone for HD video recording. However, the principal use of the accessory port was a new, high resolution, optional hotshoe mounted VF-2 electronic viewfinder (EVF). The VF-2 had a flip angle eyepiece, allowing viewing from 0‚Äì90 degrees. The high resolution VF-2 had specifications that matched the highly acclaimed built-in EVF on the Panasonic Lumix DMC-G1, the first MFT camera ever introduced. In the United States the E-P2 MSRP with 14‚Äì42 mm kit zoom lens, and VF-2 EVF, was US$1,100. The accessory VF-2 EVF was also available separately for $280.00. Available body colors were black and silver. Differences from predecessor The primary differences between the E-P2 as compared to the E-P1 which it replaced are: * Addition of an Accessory Port that can be used for an electronic viewfinder or external microphone * Two new Art filters-simulating Diorama and Cross process in camera * Black finish widely available, silver finish available in Japan * Auto focus tracking * Colour boosting function named i-Enhance  Successor Model  The E-P2 was replaced in Olympus' PEN line by the Olympus PEN E-P3 which was announced in June 2011.

Geographic range It is very common throughout the Mediterranean basin. The snake's specific name, monspessulanus, is a Latinized form of Montpellier, a city in southern France. Description It is up to long and may weigh up to . Behavior and diet It is active during the day and mainly feeds on lizards. Venom Although it is venomous, only a few cases of envenomation of humans are known, one of which occurred when a finger was inserted into the snake's mouth. The Montpellier snake is not a dangerous snake for humans. The rear fangs reduce the possibility of venom injection, and the venom is of low toxicity. Venom injections are possible in bites of big individuals.Bruna Azara C. 1995. \\"Animales venenosos. Vertebrados terrestres venenosos peligrosos para el ser humano en Espa√±a \\". Bol. SEA, 11: 32-40. The venom is not very dangerous; symptomatic treatment suffices to treat an envenomation. The unthreatening nature of the snake, along with its relatively mild persecution by man, has made it one of the most common species throughout its range, even in areas occupied by humans. Evolution Genetic evidence suggests that the species originated in the Maghreb, migrating into southwestern Europe between 83,000 and 168,000 years ago and into southeastern Europe and western Asia at an earlier time. It is most closely related to the North African and Arabian species Malpolon moilensis and to a fossil species from the Pliocene of Spain, Malpolon mlynarskii, with which it forms the genus Malpolon. Malpolon has a good fossil record, dating back to the Pliocene in both southwestern Europe and northern Africa, but many of the fossils are isolated vertebrae, which are difficult to assign to species. Subspecies There are three major subspecies of M. monspessulanus throughout its Mediterranean range. There is a deep genetic divergence between the western subspecies, M. m. monspessulanus, and the two eastern subspecies, M. m. insignitus and M. m. fuscus, leading to a proposal to recognize the eastern form as a distinct species, M. insignitus. These two groups are estimated to have split about 3.5 to 6 million years ago. A fourth subspecies, M. m. saharatlanticus, was described in 2006. M. m. monspessulanus M. m. monspessulanus occurs in southwestern Europe (Spain, Portugal, southern France and northwestern Italy) and the western Maghreb, where it is found in Morocco and coastal Algeria, east to Algiers. On the mid- body, there are usually 19 dorsal scale rows and a dark 'saddle' on the foreparts is present in males. M. m. monspessulanus possesses a single median process on its basioccipital bone that forms a strong spur, directed backwards; in the two eastern subspecies, two processes or indistinct hardened pieces of bones are present. There is little genetic or morphological differentiation between North African and European populations, suggesting a recent arrival in Europe. M. m. fuscus M. m. fuscus is found in southeastern Europe and Turkey through northern Iraq and western Iran. It differs from M. m. insignitus in having only 17 dorsal scale rows on its mid- body. M. m. saharatlanticus Another subspecies, M. m. saharatlanticus, lives in the region from Bou Izakarn in Morocco to Dakhla in the Western Sahara, inland to Aoulouz and Tafraoute. Delimitation issues Forms of M. monspessulanus found in the more arid parts of Syria, Jordan, and Iraq are sometimes hard to classify because they have either 17 or 19 scale rows, resembling both M. m. fuscus and M. m. insignitus. Human interaction The animal is not threatened by its interactions with humans and is assessed as \\"Least Concern\\", but it is often killed by cars and farmers, and is sometimes used by snake charmers and sold as curio. Even in areas affected by humans, the population is stable and in some areas growing. It is found in a number of protected areas. References Further reading *Arnold EN, Burton JA. 1978.

He and his wife Julia R. March founded March Funeral Homes located in Baltimore, Maryland, the largest African American funeral services company in the United States.http://baltimore.bizjournals.com/baltimore/stories/2006/11/27/focus2.html March was born in Mount Pleasant, North Carolina to Carrington March, a Lutheran minister, and Georgia March. In 1928, his father moved his family to Baltimore, after taking a ministry job there. However, the Marches soon discovered that there was racial prejudice even within the church. Carrington March was removed from his Baltimore ministry because he was black. Lutheran officials offered him a church of his own in Selma, Alabama, but he refused to take his family to the deep South. Began Working as a Child The Great Depression started in the United States in the late 1920s, there were especially hard economic times for all working people. When William March was only ten years old he began working selling newspapers to contribute to his family's income. The small amount of money he earned was given to his sister Thelma to pay for her transportation to school. At the age fourteen March went to work setting pins at a local bowling alley. At the same time he started Dunbar High School in east Baltimore where he attended ninth and tenth grades. He later attended Fredrick Douglass High the west side of the city for eleventh. He worked hard in school and dreamed of becoming an architect. However, he knew he had little chance of going to college to get the education required for that career. March eventually was forced to quit school so that he could help support his family. He took a job digging ditches at Edgewood Arsenal, he then moved on to the factory line. Because so many black students had to help support their families, Douglass High School began to offer night classes, and March attended every night after work until he earned his diploma. Went to War In 1941 tragedy struck the March family when William's beloved sister Thelma died in a fire during her first year at college. The same year, the United States entered World War II. When the war began, March was working on the line at Edgewood Arsenal, training to become a machinist. He had worked there for some time when his supervisors discovered that they had made a mistake. March was a light-skinned black man, with blond hair and blue eyes, and the managers at Edgewood had assumed that he was white. Once they learned that he was African American, racism prompted them to remove him from the factory line. Once March lost his job he immediately became eligible for the draft. In 1943 he was drafted into the U.S. Army. On his first six-week furlough he married Julia Roberta Hayes, his high school sweetheart. March participated in the June 6, 1944, D-Day invasion of Normandy, when Allied troops landed on several French beaches to start a new front of fighting against the Germans. After the bloody battle, March became a Master Sergeant, directing the delivery of ammunition to the front lines. He also fought in the Korean War. He received a commendation and the Jubilee Medal from France for his participation in the invasion of Normandy. When the war ended in 1945, March returned home to his wife and baby daughter. He also returned to work at Edgewood Arsenal, but he soon began to have greater ambitions. Funeral homes, like many other aspects of society, had long been racially segregated throughout the United States, and March liked the idea of providing such an important service to the black community Using his benefits under the GI Bill, he attended the American Academy of Mortuary Science in New York. Finding it difficult to obtain an apprenticeship to get his mortuary license, he worked for the U.S. Postal Service to support his family. He continued to pursue his goal of becoming a funeral director for the sake of providing a quality education for his four children. He worked at the post office at night and build his funeral business during the day. He retired from government service after more than thirty years of service. Building a Legacy In 1957 he started his family owned funeral business in his single row house on East North Avenue. In 1973, in partnership with three other funeral directors, he founded King Memorial Park, a cemetery in Baltimore County catering the African-American community. The business grew steadily until 1978 when the firm moved to a newly constructed funeral home that occupied an entire city block.In 1985, Mr. March built a second facility in West Baltimore. In 1992, the March family acquired ownership of the cemetery and expanded it to making it the largest black owned cemetery in the country. Mr. March was a co-founder and the first Chairman of the Board of the Harbor Bank of Maryland, Maryland's first minority owned commercial bank. At some point the bank controlled more than $200 million in assets and was listed in Black Enterprise Magazine's top performing minority controlled financial institutions.

He was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. However, he is one of the most famous flutist and saxophonist in Brazilian music. He performed and recorded with Lalo Schifrin, Manfredo Fest, S√©rgio Mendes, Zimbo Trio, Hermeto Pascoal, and Elis Regina. Biography Hector \\"Costita\\" Bisignani was born in 1934, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He is an Italian descendant and started studying music when he was 13 years old. The first instrument he learnt to play was clarinet. When he was 18, he started playing saxophone, influenced by Lalo Schifrin. In 1954, Schifrin invited Bisignani to compose his band. This is considered the beginning of Costita's career. In the second half of 1950's, Bisignani went to Brazil where he joined Simonetti's orchestra. He never came back to his country. In fact, Costita continued his career in Brazil and contributed to the development and divulgation of the Brazilian music. The 1960s probably was the best decade to Hector Costita. Along those years, he played with many famous musicians and recorded his main albums. In the beginning of the decade, he formed a samba trio with Jo√£o Donato and Xu Vianna. In 1962, he recorded his first album: O fabuloso Hector. In that decade, he used to presents himself as Don Junior. Despite of his solo career, Bisignani played in Sexteto Bossa Rio, with S√©rgio Mendes, from 1962 to 1964. He also played with Dick Farney (1962), Manfredo Fest (1963) and Luiz Chaves (1963). In 1964, he recorded the album which is considered the main of his career: Impacto. In 1964, Bisignani moved to France to study in Music Conservatory of Paris. Back to Brazil, he joined Carlos Piper's orchestra, but he also played as sideman for many artist such as Elis Regina and Wilson Simonal. From 1973 to 1981, Costita joined the Nelson Aires big band. After the end of that group, he started his career as teacher of music. He started teaching in CLAM, a Brazilian popular music school, created by Zimbo Trio.

While most Catholic churches established in Auglaize and Mercer counties during this time were primarily German, St. Thomas' was established by Irish settlers. Mass was celebrated in private homes until a leading member donated land for a cemetery and church, which was built in 1860. Starting in the 1840s, the church was served by priests of the Society of the Precious Blood who were based at Minster, approximately to the south. Expansion St. Thomas Cemetery During the 1870s, Six Mile prospered due to the discovery of oil and natural gas in the region and the coming of the Lake Erie and Western Railroad; when the railroad built a depot in Six Mile, it renamed the community for local resident John Glynn. St. Thomas' Church also grew, reaching the point that the old frame church was becoming too small for the number of parishioners. Accordingly, the cornerstone was laid for a new brick church in 1883. In this same year, the parish was rededicated for Saint Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland;Who was Saint Patrick, History Channel, 2008. Accessed 2009-11-23. the cemetery retained its former name. Architectural historians have divided the Precious Blood-related churches of western Ohio into multiple generations. Only a few buildings remain from the first generation, which consisted primarily of small wooden churches, and only St. John's Church in Fryburg to the east remains essentially unchanged. Replacing these wooden buildings were the churches of the second generation, which were generally small brick buildings without tall spires. St. Patrick's occupies of a transitional place between the churches of the second and third generations; although it is a small brick building that replaced an early wooden church, its tower resembles those of the High Gothic Revival churches of the third generation. Recent history In 1979, St. Patrick's Church was recognized for its architecture by being added to the National Register of Historic Places. Twenty-seven other churches, including the old mother church in Minster, were added to the Register at the same time. Today, St. Patrick's remains an active parish of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati.

It is partly based on Martin Heidegger's insights into the phenomenon of world disclosure, which Kompridis applies to the field of political theory. The term refers to practices through which we can imagine and articulate meaningful alternatives to current social and political conditions, by acting back on their conditions of intelligibility. This could uncover possibilities that were previously suppressed or untried, or make us insightfully aware of a problem in a way that allows us to go on differently with our institutions, traditions and ideals. Overview In his book Critique and Disclosure: Critical Theory between Past and Future, Kompridis describes a set of heterogeneous social practices he believes can be a source of significant ethical, political, and cultural transformation. Highlighting the work of theorists such as Hannah Arendt, Charles Taylor, Michel Foucault and others, Kompridis calls such practices examples of \\"reflective disclosure\\" after Martin Heidegger's insights into the phenomenon of world disclosure. He also argues that social criticism or critique, and in particular critical theory, ought to incorporate Heidegger's insights about this phenomenon and reorient itself around practices of reflective disclosure if it is, as he puts it, \\"to have a future worthy of its past\\". These practices, according to Kompridis, constitute what Charles Taylor calls a \\"new department\\" of reason which is distinct from instrumental reason, from reason understood merely as the slave of the passions (Hume), and from the idea of reason as public justification (Rawls). In contrast to theories of social and political change that emphasize socio-historical contradictions (i.e., Marxist and neo-Marxist), theories of recognition and self-realization, and theories that try to make sense of change in terms of processes that are outside the scope of human agency, Kompridis' paradigm for critical theory, with reflective disclosure at the centre, is to help reopen the future by disclosing alternative possibilities for speech and action, self-critically expanding what he calls the normative and logical \\"space of possibility\\". Kompridis contrasts his own vision of critical theory with a Habermasian emphasis on the procedures by which we can reach agreement in modern democratic societies. He claims the latter has ignored the utopian concerns that previously animated critical theory, and narrowed its scope in a way that brings it closer to liberal and neo-Kantian theories of justice.

Early life Mayol is the eldest of five children. At third grade, he once stopped a delinquent, who was 3 years older than he was, with just one punch. He lived with his grandparents for over a decade in Calapayan, Tubod before moving to Mandaue City. He began fighting as an amateur when he was 15 and later won two gold medals at the Palarong Pambansa (National Games). Mayol finally became professional in 2000. When he wasn't boxing, Mayol used to wash cars as well as serving as a ball boy in tennis games. Professional career Mayol accumulated a record of 22-0 before losing his first world title bout to WBC minimumweight champion Eagle Den Junlaphan by unanimous decision on May 6, 2006. On August 4, 2007, Mayol challenged Ulises Sol√≠s for the IBF light flyweight title but lost by 8th-round technical knockout. Following the loss to Solis, he fought Adri√°n Hern√°ndez on February 9, 2008 and lost again by 4th-round knockout. On June 13, 2009, he received another shot at a world title against WBO light flyweight champion Iv√°n Calder√≥n. The fight ended in a technical draw after Calderon suffered an accidental headbutt by Mayol. He faced Calderon in a rematch later that year, this time Mayol lost by technical decision after Calderon suffered another unintentional headbutt by Mayol. On November 21, 2009, he won the WBC light flyweight title by stopping reigning champion Edgar Sosa in two rounds in Mexico. Mayol was docked a point for unintentionally headbutting Sosa in the second round, sending him to the canvas and causing a cut above his cheek. When the action resumed, Mayol dropped Sosa and relentlessly attacked, forcing the referee to stop the fight. Sosa, who required a metal plate to be implanted on his cheekbone due to multiple fractures suffered from the headbutt, filed a protest with the WBC to have the decision changed to a \\"no contest\\". However, instead of changing the verdict of the bout in Sosa's favor, the WBC decided to grant the former champion the status of \\"Champion Emeritus\\", a position where Sosa will be guaranteed a rematch with Mayol upon recovery or move to the next weight class. He fought Omar Nino Romero on February 27, 2010, for his first defense of the WBC light flyweight title at the Coliseo Olimpico de la UG in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico. The bout ended with a controversial technical draw after three rounds. Despite receiving a knockdown, Mayol was able to retain his WBC junior flyweight title. Mayol was hit by his opponent with some \\"low blows.‚Äù According to writer Dong Secuya, the referee was going to stop the bout in the 3rd round when Romero fired a hard left that hit the jaw of the momentarily defenseless Mayol who went down almost without consciousness. On June 19, 2010, Mayol lost his title in a rematch with Romero in San Juan del Rio, Queretaro, Mexico. Mayol had a point deducted in the second round and another point deducted in the fifth round after Romero suffered cuts due to head clashes. Under the WBC's head-clash rule, if a fighter is cut in a clash of heads, the boxer who is not cut automatically has a point taken from his score. After the loss to Romero, He won 4 straight fights in a row. After the 4th win, He was given a World Title Eliminator.

It solves the problem of different concepts of time in quantum field theory and general relativity by treating the quantum concept as the more fundamental so that space and time are not equivalent (anisotropic) at high energy level. The relativistic concept of time with its Lorentz invariance emerges at large distances. The theory relies on the theory of foliations to produce its causal structure. It is related to topologically massive gravity and the Cotton tensor. It is a possible UV completion of general relativity. Also, the speed of light goes to infinity at high energies. The novelty of this approach, compared to previous approaches to quantum gravity such as Loop quantum gravity, is that it uses concepts from condensed matter physics such as quantum critical phenomena. Ho≈ôava's initial formulation was found to have side-effects such as predicting very different results for a spherical Sun compared to a slightly non-spherical Sun, so others have modified the theory. Inconsistencies remain. However progress has been made on the theory. The detailed balance condition Ho≈ôava originally imposed the theory to satisfy the detailed balance condition which considerably reduces the number of terms in the action.

The anion is formed, together with peroxocarbonate , at the negative electrode during electrolysis of molten lithium carbonate. The anion can also be obtained by electrolysis of a saturated solution of rubidium carbonate in water. In addition, the peroxodicarbonate anion can be obtained by electrosynthesis on boron doped diamond (BDD) electrodes. The formal oxidation of two carbonate ions takes place at the anode. Due to the high oxidation potential of the peroxodicarbonate anion, a high anodic overpotential is necessary. This is even more important if hydroxyl radicals are involved in the formation process. Recent publication show that a concentration of 282 mmol/l of peroxodicarbonate can be reached in an undivided cell with sodium carbonate as starting material at current densities of 720 mA/cm¬≤. The described process is suitable for pilot scale production of sodium peroxodicarbonate. Potassium peroxydicarbonate K2C2O6 was obtained by Constam and von Hansen in 1895; its crystal structure was determined only in 2002.

They were designed by Jacques Ignace Hittorff, and completed in 1840 during the reign of King Louis-Philippe. The south fountain commemorates the maritime commerce and industry of France, and the north fountain commemorates navigation and commerce on the rivers of France.  History  Before the French Revolution, during the period 1753‚Äì1772, when the square was called Place Louis XV, the architect Jacques-Ange Gabriel designed a plan for a monumental statue of Louis XV with two fountains, but because of a lack of sufficient water, it was never carried out. Gabriel did complete the building of the Ministry of the Navy overlooking the square - its presence later influenced the choice of themes for the Fontaines de la Concorde.The Fountain as Propaganda, by Maria Ann Conelli and Marilyn Symmes, in Fountains - Splash and Spectacle. pg. 90-95. During the French Revolution, the square was renamed Place de la Revolution, the guillotine was placed there, and King Louis XVI and thousands of others were beheaded near the site of the present fountains. In 1795, after the Reign of Terror ended, the square was renamed the Place de la Concorde. After the restoration of the Monarchy in 1816 the square was renamed in the Memory of King Louis XVI. The completion of the Canal de l'Ourcq in 1824, bringing water from outside the city to the Center of Paris, made it possible to build new fountains in the Place de la Concorde. In 1829, during the rule of King Charles X, the city sponsored a competition for a new plan for the square, which was to include no less than four fountains. One of the entrants in the competition was Jacques Ignace Hittorff, a German by birth, who had previously designed decorations for festivals, funerals, and the 1825 coronation of Charles X. The plan of Hittorff featured four fountains in four quadrants surrounding an equestrian statue of Louis XVI. His plan was not selected. After the 1830 July Revolution, the new King, Louis-Philippe, renamed the square Place de la Concorde and rejected the earlier project for the Place. In 1831, when the viceroy of Egypt, Mohammed Ali, gave the King the gift of an obelisk dating from the time of Ramses II from Luxor, Louis-Philippe selected Hittorff to design a setting for the obelisk in time for the 1833 July festival, intended to commemorate the anniversary of his rule. Shortly afterwards Louis-Philippe gave him a commission to redesign the entire square. Hittorff worked on the design for the square and for four fountains from 1833 to 1840, consulting closely with Claude Philibert Barthelot Rambuteau, the Prefect of the Seine. The principal influence on his fountain designs were the twin fountains in Piazza San Pietro in Rome, which also are placed on either side on an obelisk, and which Hittdorff had seen on a visit to Rome in the 1820s. Another influence was Piazza Navona in Rome, where two fountains were placed on either side of an obelisk. Like the fountains of Piazza Navona, the Fontaines de la Concorde were placed on an axis that connected the Church of the Madeleine and the Rue Royale to the north and the bridge to the Palais Bourbon to the south. Twelve different sculptors worked on the statuary of the fountains, closely supervised by Hittorff, who made sure that the entire ensemble would be harmonious and balanced. A prominent feature of the design of both fountains was a mushroom-shaped cap above the central vasque. Water was to jet from the top of the cap and then cascade downward into a circular vasque, then down into a large circular basin below.Conelli and Symmes, pg. 94 The major figures of the fountains were made of cast iron, florentined, or painted with bronze and gold paint. The smaller figures of the tritons and nereids were made of bronze. Between 1833 and 1840, Hittdorff modified the plans several times. In 1835, when a government committee reported that the water supply would not be sufficient for four new fountains, he reduced the number to two. The obelisk was put in place on the square on October 25, 1836. Both fountains were completed in May, 1840. In 1862‚Äì63, the fountains were restored, and the bronze and gold paint was replaced with a bronze coating. Sculptors The sculptors who worked on the fountain were: *Auguste-Hyacinthe Debay (The Atlantic and the Mediterranean) *Antoine Desboeufs (Coral and Fish) *Achille- Joseph-√âtienne Valois (Shells and Pearls) *Isidore-Hippolyte Brion (Maritime navigation, Astronomy and Commerce) *Jean-Fran√ßois-Th√©odore Gechter (The Rh√¥ne and the Rhine) *Fran√ßois-Gaspard Lanno (Flowers and Fruit) *Honor√©-Jean Husson (Wheat and Grapes) *Jean-Jacques Feuch√®re (River Navigation, Industry and Agriculture) *Jean-Jacques Elshoecht, Louis-Parfait Merlieux, Antonin-Marie Moine (tritons and neriads).Beatrice Lamoitier, L'Essor des fontaines monumentales (1830‚Äì1848), in Paris et ses Fontaines.  Symbolism  The Maritime Fountain, to the south, closer to the River Seine, represents the maritime spirit of France. Large semi-nude figures supporting the vasque represent the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. Other figures beneath the vasque represent the industries of the sea; coral, fish, shells and pearls.Connelli and Symmes, pg. 94 The figures are seated in the prow of a ship, the symbol of the City of Paris, and they are surrounded by dolphins spraying water through their nostrils. Above the vasque, supporting the mushroom-shaped cap, are figures representing the spirits of Maritime Navigation, Astronomy and Commerce. Next to them are swans which spout water into the basin below. In the basin, tritons and nereids hold fish which spout water upwards to the rim of the vasque. The Fountain of the Rivers, to the north, closer to the Madeleine church, has large figures supporting the vasque who represent the Rh√¥ne River and the Rhine River. The other major figures represent the main harvests of France; Wheat and Grapes, Flowers and Fruit. The figures above the vasque who support the cap represent the spirits of River Navigation, Agriculture and Industry. Water supply and the fountain design Water for the fountains was supplied by the canal de l'Ourcq, begun by Napoleon at the beginning of his reign. The original fountains had no pumps and operated by gravity- water flowed from the basin at La Villette, where the water of the canal arrived in Paris, at a higher elevation than the Place de la Concorde. The overflow water went into the Seine. Beginning in 1840, 6,000 cubic meters of water per day from La Villette were set aside for the Fontaines de la Concorde.Projet de distribution des eaux de la place de la Concorde et d'embelisssement des Champs-Elysees, Prefecture du departement de la Seine, 1837. Cited in Paris et ses Fontaines, pg. 193. The fountains were carefully designed so that a sheet of water flowed evenly from the rim of the vasque, even if the wind was strong and the water supply was uneven. A small channel hidden just inside the rim of the vasque moderates the flow of water.Schneider, pg. 400 In the 20th century, the gravity system was replaced with pumps, which recycle the water.

It is located on a hill where an important battle took place in the Six Day War. Archaeological excavations have revealed important ancient Jewish tombs in the region. Givat Hamivtar was one of the first \\"Build Your Own Home\\" neighborhoods in Jerusalem. The international community considers Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. History The hill on which Givat Hamivtar was established was the site of a Jordanian fort, one of a series of military installations blocking Jewish access to Mount Scopus and cutting off Hadassah Hospital, the Hebrew University, and the National Library of Israel from West Jerusalem. The Jordanians called it Tal al-Mudura, lit. \\"round hill.\\" Jordanian snipers used this strategic location to fire on Israeli troops during the Battle of Ammunition Hill. Givat HaMivtar was conquered by an Israeli tank force after two attempts. The first mission failed after an Israeli soldier was killed by friendly fire. The Jerusalem neighborhood of Givat Hamivtar was planned as part of a sequence of Jewish neighborhoods called the bariah or \\"hinge\\" neighborhoods◊°◊ô◊ï◊® ◊ú◊ê◊ï◊®◊ö \\"◊î◊ß◊ï ◊î◊¢◊ô◊®◊ï◊†◊ô\\", ◊ê◊ô◊ú◊ü ◊©◊§◊ô◊®◊ê connecting west Jerusalem to Mount Scopus. The name of the neighborhood means \\"bissected hill,\\" either referring to the crisscross of Jordan bunkers that existed before the neighborhood was built, or the earthworks cutting through Mount Scopus to create a road from Jerusalem's Old City to Nablus. The earthworks cutting picture, early 1970s. In July 1967, Prime Minister Levi Eshkol ordered government clerks to bypass the ordinary procedures to allow for Givat HaMivtar and the other hinge neighborhoods to be built as quickly as possible. When purchasing land encountered difficulties, some tracts were expropriated. To speed up the building process, land was subsidized by the government. Most of the homes in Givat HaMivtar were privately built. The majority of the homes were two-family homes, originally one-story high, to which a second and often a third floor was added over time. Archaeology Numerous archeological digs have been carried out in Givat HaMivtar. Sepulchers discovered in the course of the digs were determined to be Jewish tombs of the Second Temple period.

However, according to anthropologist Joe Zias, former Curator of Archaeology and Anthropology for the Israel Antiquities Authority, this theory is just little more than an urban myth, since the only beheaded skeleton found in 1971 and at the later reexamination of the previously untouched tomb, belonged to an elderly woman. In his view, no other set of remains found there could be associated with King Antigonus II. Services Givat HaMivtar has only preschools and kindergartens. The elementary schools of Ramat Eshkol were built on the border between the two neighborhoods in order to serve them both. High schools are located on French Hill and Ma'allot Dafna. The first synagogue in Givat HaMivtar was unique in that prayer services followed a non- specific nusach so that Jews of all ethnic groups could pray there. In the first decade of this millennium, many of the neighborhood's secular and Modern Orthodox residents have moved out, and ultra-Orthodox Jews have become a majority. Since the mid-1980s, there is a Makuya center in the neighborhood.

Background  Elvis Presley performed the song in the 1958 motion picture King Creole, and his recording was included on the soundtrack of the same name. \\"Trouble\\", featuring Scotty Moore on guitar, was one of only three songs written by Leiber and Stoller for the feature. Presley's performance in the film alludes to Muddy Waters and Bo Diddley. \\"If you're looking for trouble\\", he intones, \\"then look right in my face. Because I'm evil. My middle name is Misery\\". Music critic Maury Dean suggests that \\"Trouble\\", with Presley's \\"growling snarl\\", is one of the earliest proto-punk rock songs.Dean, Maury. Rock N Roll Gold Rush: A Singles Un-Cyclopedia p. 438. Ten years later, Presley opened his 1968 comeback special with this number. With dark, moody lighting highlighting his sneer, the sequence alluded to Presley's checkered past and \\"dangerous\\" image and served to prove that the singer was still \\"sexy, surly and downright provocative\\".Doll, Susan. Understanding Elvis: Southern Roots vs. Star Image 1998. p. 154.Doll, Susan. Elvis for Dummies 2009. p. 182. The piece then segued into \\"Guitar Man\\" against a \\"Jailhouse Rock\\" backdrop featuring male dancers in cells. Presley performed the song several times on tour in the early 1970s and unofficial recordings of these performances have circulated. In 1975, Presley recorded \\"T-R-O-U-B-L-E\\" for a single, but this is a completely different song. The song was included in the musical revue Smokey Joe's Cafe.  Composition  The song uses the same \\"stop-time\\" riff as Muddy Waters' 1954 song \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\" written by Willie Dixon. This particular riff is one of the most recognizable lick in blues, and is also heard in Bo Diddley's \\"I'm a man\\" (1955) and Muddy Waters' \\"Mannish boy\\" (1955). Indeed, the key feature of the song is the use of stop time, or pauses in the music, during the first half of the progression. This musical device is commonly heard in New Orleans jazz, when the instrumentation briefly stops, allowing for a short instrumental solo before resuming.  Amanda Lear version  Singer and model Amanda Lear recorded a French-language version of \\"Trouble\\", retitled as \\"La Bagarre\\", with French lyrics written by Vline Buggy (originally recorded by Johnny Hallyday in 1962). The cover was released as her debut single in France and Belgium in 1975 by Polydor Records, with \\"Lethal Leading Lady\\" on the side B, a song co-written by Lear. The single turned out a commercial failure and in 1976, an English-language version with original lyrics was released in the UK by Creole Records and other parts of Europe, again to no chart success. Lear performed the song in an episode of Musikladen aired 29 May 1976 in West Germany, clad in black leather outfit, alluding to Presley's tough 1950s image. The performance led Ariola Records to re-release \\"La Bagarre\\" and sign her to a six-album record contract. The single was also promoted by an appearance in German TV show 3 nach 9. \\"La Bagarre\\" was included on Lear's 1977 debut album I Am a Photograph. However, it was removed from the track listing of subsequent pressings in favour of \\"Queen of Chinatown\\". In 1980, \\"La Bagarre\\" was re-released with \\"Le Chat de goutti√®re\\" on side B, a song with both music and lyrics written by Lear and recorded for francophone markets. Lear recorded the English-language version of the song for her 2014 album of Elvis Presley covers, My Happiness.

Since the revival of the Pittsburgh Marathon in 2009, participation in the Great Race has increased dramatically, meeting registration caps enacted to limit the total number of runners.

Both races finish at the same location in Point State Park in downtown Pittsburgh. By 2014, nearly 16,000 runners were registered between the 5k and 10k races, and in 2015 the race is capped at 11,000 runners in the 10k course and 5,500 runners in the 5k course for a total of 16,500 entrants. Beginning at the foot of Frick Park, the course of the Great Race leads through some of Pittsburgh's best-known neighborhoods, including Squirrel Hill, Oakland, The Bluff (Uptown), and Downtown. Runners pass the three largest universities in Pittsburgh during the race, Carnegie Mellon, University of Pittsburgh, and Duquesne.

It generally grows on rocks and occasionally on tree roots in nature. Description Polypodium virginianum is a small rhizomatous fern with narrow leaves long and wide borne on smooth, scaleless petioles . Leaves are evergreen, oblong and pinnatifid with acuminate tips. Large, circular sori are prominently featured on the underside of fertile fronds in late summer and autumn. Sporangia are intermixed with long brown glandular hairs. Taxonomy Polypodium virginianum has several synonyms including: P. vinlandicum A. Love & D. Love, P. vulgare L. var. americanum Hooker, P. vulgare L. var. virginianum (L.) D. C. Eaton. It is generally treated as distinct, though some have recommended it is equally well treated as a North American variety of the circumboreal Polypodium vulgare. This species is an allotetraploid of hybrid origin, the parents being Polypodium appalachianum and P. sibiricum.  Distribution and habitat  Polypodium virginianum typically grows on boulders, cliffs, and rocky slopes and does not need well- developed soil. It is common throughout eastern North America; its native distribution ranges from Newfoundland to Yukon south to Georgia, Alabama, and Arkansas.

The port is divided into five sectors, with a total land area of 619 hectares. History Hachinohe developed as a castle town of the Nanbu clan‚Äôs Hachinohe Domain in the Edo period. The port was a major fishing port, and a port of call for the coastal trade from Osaka and Edo to Hokkaid≈ç. In modern times, the area was earmarked for economic development by the Meiji government, which hired Dutch oyatoi gaikokujin civil engineer Anthonie Rouwenhorst Mulder (1848‚Äì1901) to redesign and rebuilt the port facilities along western lines. Immigration facilities were established in 1925, and the port was officially opened for foreign trade by the Home Ministry in 1928. It was designated a primary seaport by the Japanese government in 1954. The port facilities suffered minor damage from a tsunami caused by the 1960 Valdivia earthquake off Chile and again in 1968 from the Tokachi-oki earthquake. The port facilities were continually expanded from the 1970s through the 1990s, with additional berths and the construction of a port island. Regularly scheduled container services to Southeast Asia began in 1994, to Korea and the United States in 1998, and to China in 1999. In 2001, the Hattaro Refrigerated Warehouse was completed, furnishing the Port of Hachinohe with a temperature control and humidification system for storage of agricultural products. In March 2011, the port facilities were severely damaged by a tsunami from the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake. Shipping Hachinohe Port Authority administers the Port of Hachinohe and its 48 berths for both domestic and international container services. Domestic routes include Tokyo and Yokohama, and overseas routes include Taiwan, Singapore, Korea, Australia, South America, Europe, Canada, and the United States. The port has seven fuel terminals with capacity to store over 11 million barrels of oil, and supplies fuel for the local fishing fleet as well as nearby Misawa Air Base operated by the United States Air Force.

It was a hybrid eclipse of the Sun with a magnitude of 1.0159, with a small portion over the western Atlantic Ocean at sunrise as an annular eclipse, and the rest of the path as a narrow total solar eclipse. A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A hybrid solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is smaller than the Sun's in sunrise and sunset, but at Greatest Eclipse the Moon's apparent diameter is larger than the Sun's. In this particular case the eclipse path starts out as annular. Further down the track it changes to total and then back to annular before the path ends. It was the 23rd eclipse of the 143rd Saros cycle, which began with a partial eclipse on March 7, 1617 and will conclude with a partial eclipse on April 23, 2897.

The band was the first well-known group that guitarist Myles Kennedy played in. The original lineup consisted of Jim Templeton on keyboard, Gary Edighoffer on saxophone, Clipper Anderson on double bass, Myles Kennedy on guitar, and Scott Reusser on drums. Kennedy eventually left the band and went on to become the lead vocalist/lead guitarist for a jazz fusion group called Citizen Swing and later an alternative rock band called The Mayfield Four. Kennedy is now fronting and playing guitar for the hard rock/alternative metal band Alter Bridge, which he helped form with Creed members Mark Tremonti, Scott Phillips, and Brian Marshall in 2004, and is also the lead vocalist for Slash's solo band. Over the years, band's members have changed as Jim moved from Spokane, WA to Vancouver, WA to take advantage of the music scene near Portland, OR. (Jim had an extended stint in Denmark where his son Janus is a popular jazz drummer. Jim spent his time teaching music at a University there). After moving to Vancouver, Jim got his new band up and running and opened a jazz club named Ivories located in downtown Portland. After several years the club closed as the jazz scene in Portland waned. The same year Ivories closed, a dozen other venues that featured jazz also closed. The band went through several iterations as fusion was not, and is not, a popular draw in Portland. The band's third and final release \\"The Dust Also Rises\\" was more of a final documentation of Jim's tunes than a commercial release. Mike Doolin and Charles Neal remained in the band for the third release with original member, and long-time Spokane, WA friend, Gary Edighoffer returning for the third, and final, Cosmic Dust album. Cosmic Dust has three albums, Journey in 1991, Step Right Up! in 2008 and The Dust Also Rises in 2017.

Page 229  Early life  Laszczka was born into a large farming family in Masovia, the son of Antoni Laszczka and his wife Katarzyna, from Kupce village. His talent was first discovered by the Ostrowscy family of landed gentry who sponsored his art studies in Warsaw in 1885 under the tutorage of Jan Kry≈Ñski and Ludwik Pyrowicz. Soon later Laszczka received a scholarship from the Polish Society of Visual Arts (Towarzystwo Sztuk Piƒôknych) called \\"Zachƒôta\\" and went to Paris in 1891. While in France, he studied at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts Academy. He received directions from such artists as Jean-Antoine Merci√©, Alexandre Falguiere and Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me. He was also involved in the arts movement of the French Polonia. In 1897 Laszczka returned to Poland under foreign partitions and became a teacher in Warsaw. \\"The Avenging Angel\\" by Konstanty Laszczka, regarded as one of the most beautiful sculptures at the Rakowicki Cemetery \\"Rakowicki Cemetery\\" at Krakow Travel, with map and photographs In 1899 at the invitation of painter Julian Fa≈Çat, Laszczka settled in Krak√≥w where he became the professor at the Academy of Fine Arts. In years 1900-1935 he was a director at the Sculpture Department there.  Professional career  While in Krak√≥w, Konstanty Laszczka became close friends with Stanis≈Çaw Wyspia≈Ñski and Leon Wycz√≥≈Çkowski. He was one of the founding members of the Society of Polish Artists called \\"Sztuka\\" (Art), with the aesthetic philosophy of the Young Poland Movement. Among his students were: Stanis≈Çaw Jackowski, Boles≈Çaw Biegas, Xawery Dunikowski, Ludwik Konarzewski, Franciszek MƒÖczy≈Ñski and Olga Niewska, among others.

His son, Bogdan Laszczka, became an architect and activist of the Polish Tatra Society. Laszczka died in Krak√≥w at the end of the Stalinist period and was buried there at the famous Rakowicki Cemetery.

It may or may not be reciprocal, and occurs in both endotherms and ectotherms.The Royal Society. Kleptothermy: an additional category of thermoregulation, and a possible example in sea kraits (Laticauda laticaudata, Serpentes) One of its forms is huddling. However, kleptothermy can happen between different species that share the same habitat, and can also happen in pre-hatching life where embryos are able to detect thermal changes in the environment. This process requires two major conditions: the thermal heterogeneity created by the presence of a warm organism in a cool environment in addition to the use of that heterogeneity by another animal to maintain body temperatures at higher (and more stable) levels than would be possible elsewhere in the local area. The purpose of this behaviour is to enable these groups to increase its thermal inertia, retard heat loss and/or reduce the per capita metabolic expenditure needed to maintain stable body temperatures. Kleptothermy is seen in cases where ectotherms regulate their own temperatures and exploit the high and constant body temperatures exhibited by endothermic species. In this case, the endotherms involved are not only mammals and birds; they can be termites that maintain high and constant temperatures within their mounds where they provide thermal regimes that are exploited by a wide array of lizards, snakes and crocodilians. However, many cases of kleptothermy involve ectotherms sheltering inside the burrows used by endotherms to help maintain a high a constant body temperature. Huddling Male Canadian garter snakes huddle around a female after hibernation when mating. Huddling confers higher and more constant body temperatures than solitary resting. Some species of ectotherms including lizards and snakes, such as boa constrictors and tiger snakes, increase their effective mass by clustering tightly together. It is also widespread amongst gregarious endotherms such as bats and birds (such as the mousebird and emperor penguin) where it allows the sharing of body heat, particularly among juveniles.emperor penguins. In white-backed mousebirds (Colius colius), individuals maintain rest-phase body temperature above 32 ¬∞C despite air temperatures as low as -3.4 ¬∞C. This rest-phase body temperature was synchronized among individuals that cluster. Sometimes, kleptothermy is not reciprocal and might be accurately described as heat-stealing. For example, some male Canadian red sided garter snakes engage in female mimicry in which they produce fake pheromones after emerging from hibernation. This causes rival males to cover them in a mistaken attempt to mate, and so transfer heat to them. In turn, those males that mimic females become rapidly revitalized after hibernation (which depends upon raising their body temperature), giving them an advantage in their own attempts to mate. Bat cluster together to maintain high and constant body temperatures. On the other hand, huddling allows emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) to save energy, maintain a high body temperature and sustain their breeding fast during the Antarctic winter. This huddling behaviour raises the ambient temperature that these penguins are exposed to above 0 ¬∞C (at average external temperatures of -17 ¬∞C). As a consequence of tight huddles, ambient temperatures can be above 20 ¬∞C and can increase up to 37.5 ¬∞C, close to birds' body temperature. Therefore, this complex social behaviour is what enables all breeders to get an equal and normal access to an environment which allows them to save energy and successfully incubate their eggs during the Antarctic winter. Habitat sharing Many ectotherms exploit the heat produced by endotherms by sharing their nests and burrows. For example, mammal burrows are used by geckos and seabird burrows by Australian tiger snakes and New Zealand tuatara. Termites create high and regulated temperatures in their mounds, and this is exploited by some species of lizards, snakes and crocodiles. Research has shown such kleptothermy can be advantageous in cases such as the blue-lipped sea krait (Laticauda laticaudata), where these reptiles occupy a burrow of a pair of wedge-tailed shearwater incubating their chick. This in turn, raises its body temperature to , compared to when present in other habitats. Its body temperature is also observed to be more stable. On the other hand, burrows without birds did not provide this heat, being only . Another example would be the case of the fairy prion (Pachyptila turtur) that forms a close association with a medium-sized reptile, the tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus). These reptiles share the burrows made by the birds, and often stay when the birds are present which helps maintain a higher body temperature. Research has shown that fairy prions enable tuatara to maintain a higher body temperature through the night for several months of the year, October to January (austral spring to summer). During the night, tuatara sharing a burrow with a bird had the most thermal benefits and helped maintain their body temperature up to 15 hours the next day.  Pre-hatching life  Research done on embryos of Chinese softshell turtles (Pelodiscus sinensis) falsify the assumption that behavioural thermoregulation is possible only for post-hatching stages of the reptile life history. Remarkably, even undeveloped and tiny embryos were able to detect thermal differentials within the egg and move to exploit that small-scale heterogeneity. Research has shown that this behaviour exhibited by reptile embryos may well enhance offspring fitness where movements of these embryos enabled them to maximize heat gain from their surroundings and thus increase their body temperatures. This in turn leads to a variation in the embryonic development rate and the incubation period as well. This could benefit the embryos in which a warmer incubation increases developmental rate and therefore accelerating the hatching process. On the other hand, decreased incubation periods also may minimize the embryo's exposure to risks of nest predation or lethal extremes thermal conditions where embryos move to cooler regions of the egg during periods of dangerously high temperatures. In addition, embryonic thermoregulation could enhance hatching fitness via modifications to a range of phenotypic traits where embryos with minimal temperature differences hatch at the same time decreasing the individuals' risk of predation. Therefore, the developmental rates of embryos of reptiles are not passive consequences of maternally enforced decisions about the temperatures that the embryo will experience before hatching. Instead, the embryo's behaviour and physiology combine, allowing the smallest embryos to control aspects of their own pre-hatching environment showing that the embryo is not simply a work in progress, but is a functioning organism with surprisingly sophisticated and effective behaviours.  Evolution  Ectotherms and endotherms undergo different evolutionary perspectives where mammals and birds thermoregulate far more precisely than ectotherms.A major benefit of precise thermoregulation is the ability to enhance performance through thermal specialization. Therefore, mammals and birds are assumed to have evolved relatively narrow performance breadths. Thus, the heterothermy of these endotherms would lead to losses of performance during certain periods and therefore genetic variation in thermosensitivity would enable the evolution of thermal generalists in more heterothermic species. The physiologies of the endotherms allows them to adapt within the constraints imposed by genetics, development, and physics. On the other side, the mechanisms for thermoregulation did not evolve separately,but rather in connection with other functions. These mechanisms were more likely quantitative rather than qualitative and it involved selection of appropriate habitats, changes in levels of locomotor activity, optimum energy liberation, and conservation of metabolic substrates. The evolution of endothermy is directly linked to the selection for high levels of activity sustained by aerobic metabolism. The evolution of the complex behaviour patterns among the birds and mammals requires the evolution of metabolic systems that support the activity prior to that. Endothermy in vertebrates evolved along separate, but parallel lines from different groups of reptilian ancestors. The advantages of endothermy are manifested in the ability to occupy thermal areas that exclude many ectothermic vertebrates, a high degree of thermal independence from environmental temperature, high muscular power output and sustained levels of activity. Endothermy, however, is energetically very expensive and requires a great deal of food, compared with ectotherms in order to support high metabolic rates.

He designed a large number of bank branches, country houses, churches and church halls. His most significant commissions include the housing developments at Well Court and Ramsay Garden, both in Edinburgh. Biography Well Court (inner courtyard) Former Craighouse Asylum, Edinburgh Part of Ramsay Garden, Edinburgh The Mitchell grave, Rosebank Cemetery, Edinburgh Mitchell was born on 7 January 1856 in Larbert, Stirlingshire, the only son of Margaret Hay Houston and Dr Arthur Mitchell. His father was Commissioner in Lunacy for Scotland, Chairman of the Scottish Life Assurance Company, President of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, and was a director of the Commercial Bank of Scotland. After private tutoring, Mitchell attended the University of Edinburgh, and completed his training in the office of Robert Rowand Anderson, where he was articled from 1878 to 1883. From being an apprentice, Mitchell went into professional practice in 1883, using family contacts to gain commissions, and having a prestigious office bought with his family's wealth at 122 George Street. George Wilson, whom he had worked with at the office of Robert Rowand Anderson, came with him as his assistant, despite being 12 years his senior. They had a lifelong relationship. Their first commission came in 1883, for the proprietor of The Scotsman newspaper, John Ritchie Findlay, whose home, 3 Rothesay Terrace, he remodelled. Another significant early commission from Findlay was for Well Court, a workers' housing development in Dean Village, Edinburgh, which he worked on between 1883 and 1886. The same year, Mitchell undertook work for the Commercial Bank, and in 1884 was appointed architect to the Bank, taking over from David Rhind who had retired in 1881. This brought him a steady stream of work, and he designed or remodelled over 20 branches over the following years. In 1885, Mitchell was engaged to restore Edinburgh's Mercat Cross. This led to a commission to recreate several of Edinburgh's demolished medieval buildings, including the Netherbow, as part of the Edinburgh Exhibition of 1886. He continued to draw on the Scots Renaissance style, which he had employed at Well Court, in such projects as Duntreath Castle (1890). Mitchell took his assistant, George Wilson, into partnership in 1887. Practicing as Sydney Mitchell & Wilson, they were appointed by the Board of Lunacy in Scotland (due to Mitchell's fathers position as Director), with commissions for Craighouse in Edinburgh, the Crichton Royal Institution in Dumfries, Melrose Asylum, and the Royal Victoria Hospital in Edinburgh. Later works, such as Ramsay Garden close to Edinburgh Castle, incorporated more Arts & Crafts influences. His last major project was the United Free Church of Scotland Offices on George Street, Edinburgh (1908). In 1900 his office was at 13 Young Street in Edinburgh's New Town and, despite relative success, was still living with his parents, in a Georgian building at 34 Drummond Place, slightly north of his office.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1900-1901 George Wilson retired in 1907, and Mitchell sold the practice to his assistant, Ernest Auldjo Jamieson, in 1909.http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=100045 Mitchell retired to Gullane, East Lothian, where he died unmarried in 1930.

The species is found in the west coast of North America, Hawaii, and Japan, where it grows on decaying hardwoods, particularly species of alder. Its fruit bodies have convex to flattened orange-brown caps up to in diameter, brown stipes, and whitish to pinkish-tan gills. Taxonomy The species was described scientifically in 1996 by American mycologists Tom Volk and Harold Burdsall. Although the existence of the species as a distinct taxon was known for several years before that, it took several years to collect sufficient specimens and determine an appropriate type collection. The original published description is based on collections found growing on the fallen trunk of Acer macrophyllum in Olympic National Park, Washington, in October 1993. The specific epithet nabsnona is derived from an acronym of \\" _N_ orth _A_ merican _B_ iological _S_ pecimen\\" and nona (ninth). Description The fruit bodies have caps that are initially convex before flattening in age, and reach diameters between . The cap has a smooth surface that becomes sticky when wet. Young specimens can have short, dark hairs on the center. The cap color is brownish, becoming paler towards the edge, and frequently has darker, irregularly shaped bruise spots. The cap margin appears grooved or furrowed due to the thin flesh (measuring 0.5‚Äì1 mm thick) and the gills underneath. The gills have an adnate to somewhat decurrent attachment to the stipe. They are somewhat distantly spaced, 0.75‚Äì1 mm wide, and initially white to cream before darkening to pinkish-tan in maturity. The brownish stipe measures long by 2‚Äì3 mm thick, with a broader base measuring 4‚Äì5 mm. It has a ring, and whitish patches of cottony mycelium on its surface below the ring. The ring develops from a dense, white and cottony partial veil that becomes ragged as the cap grows, and sometimes persists as a temporary cortina. Rhizomorphs, if present, are black, branched, and 1‚Äì2 mm thick. The spore print is white. Spores are smooth, hyaline (translucent), inamyloid, and have an ovoid to somewhat more or less spherical shape. They typically measure in the range 8‚Äì10 by 5.5‚Äì6.5 ¬µm. The basidia are club-shaped, four-spored, and 25‚Äì35 by 5.5‚Äì6 ¬µm, and have a clamp at their bases. Additional basidia may arise from the basal clamp, a branching pattern that distinguishes this species from other Armillaria. This feature becomes less visually prominent as the hymenium matures and neighboring basidia expand and become crowded. The mycelium of the fungus is bioluminescent. Habitat and distribution The fruit bodies of Armillaria nabsnona grow in groups, but not clustered together at the base. They are found on hardwood trees (especially Alnus) in riparian areas. Although it fruits most commonly in autumn, it has been recorded fruiting in the spring in Oregon The range of the fungus was originally described as covering roughly the Pacific Northwest region of North America, including the US states of Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Alaska, and the Canadian province British Columbia. In 2008 it was recorded in Hawaii; in 2009, it was reported from Hokkaido Island in northern Japan. Japanese researchers have reported a symbiotic association with the orchid Gastrodia elata.

Brazill (born September 22, 1986) is an American who, at age 13, fatally shot one of his schoolteachers, Barry Grunow, at Lake Worth Middle School in Lake Worth, Florida. Brazill was subsequently convicted and sentenced to 28 years in prison. Shooting and conviction On May 26, 2000, the last day of the 1999-2000 school year, Brazill--a seventh grade student-- shot and killed Barry Grunow, an English teacher at Lake Worth Middle School in Lake Worth, Florida. After being sent home from school earlier in the day for throwing a water balloon, Brazill had returned home, retrieved a .25-caliber handgun, and shot Grunow.Dana Canedy, Boy Who Killed Teacher Is Found Guilty of Murder, New York Times (May 17, 2001). Brazill was tried as an adult and convicted of second-degree murder for the killing of Grunow and aggravated assault for pointing the gun at another teacher. The jury decided not to convict Brazill of first-degree murder, which requires premeditation and carries a mandatory life sentence in Florida. Brazill was sentenced to 28 years in state prison followed by 7 years of probation. Subsequent civil litigation Pam Grunow, the widow of the murdered teacher, sued the Brazill family friend that owned the handgun used, the Palm Beach County School Board, and the pawn shop that sold the handgun. These cases were settled for over $1 million. Grunow also filed an action against the gun manufacturer that resulted in a $1.2 million jury verdict, but the trial judge set aside the verdict, and in 2005 the Florida District Court of Appeals upheld this ruling.Eliot Kleinberg, Lake Worth Middle teacher killed by student 15 years ago, Palm Beach Post (May 28, 2015).Grunow v.

Receptor activity  It has been shown that the actions of abnormal cannabidiol are mediated through a site separate from the CB1 and CB2 receptors, which responds to abnormal cannabidiol, O-1602, and the endogenous ligands: anandamide (AEA), N-arachidonoyl glycine (NAGly) and N-arachidonoyl L-serine. Multiple lines of evidence support the proposed identification of this novel target in microglia as the previously \\"orphan\\" receptor GPR18. Another possible target of abnormal cannabidiol is GPR55, which has also received much attention as a putative cannabinoid receptor, although a growing body of evidence points to lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) as the endogenous ligand for GPR55. Further research suggests there are yet more additional cannabinoid receptors.  Pharmacodynamics  Research of the effects on abnormal cannabidiol in mice has indicated that atypical cannabinoids have therapeutic potential in a variety of inflammatory conditions, including those of the gastrointestinal tract. After inducing colitis by means of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, wound healing of both human umbilical vein endothelial and epithelial cells was enhanced by the Abn-CBD.
