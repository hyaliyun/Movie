Formed in 1878 as the Columbus Gallery of Fine Arts (its name until 1978),Museum chronology it was the first art museum to register its charter with the state of Ohio. The museum collects and exhibits American and European modern and contemporary art, folk art, glass art, and photography. The museum has been led by Executive Director Nannette Maciejunes since 2003. History The Sessions house and William Monypeny houses, hosting the art museum (left) and Columbus Art School (right) The Pizzuti Collection Claude Monet, Weeping Willow, 1918 The CMA was founded in 1878 as the Columbus Gallery of Fine Arts. Beginning in 1919, it was housed in the Francis C. Sessions house, a founder of Columbus Art School (later known as Columbus College of Art and Design (CCAD). Sessions deeded the mansion and property to the art museum, which operated there until 1923. The house was demolished, with the current museum built on its site. CCAD's Beaton Hall includes elements from the entranceway of the Sessions house. The current building was built on the same site from 1929 to 1931, opening on January 22, 1931. In 1974, a visually unobtrusive structure was added to the rear of the building. The museum building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 19, 1992, under its original name. The Columbus Museum of Art began a massive reconstruction and expansion in 2007. The first new space opened on January 1, 2011, after 13 months of construction. The space, called the Center for Creativity, is an space that includes galleries, gathering areas, and places for workshops that allow visitors to engage in hands-on activities. On October 25, 2015, the new Margaret M. Walter wing opened to the public, adding 50,000 square feet of addition and 40,000 square feet of major renovation to the Museum. The Margaret M. Walter Wing was designed by Michael Bongiorno of the Columbus- based architecture firm DesignGroup.https://architizer.com/blog/practice/materials/michael-bongiorno- columbus-museum-of-art/ In September 2018, the Pizzuti Collection, a museum in the Short North, was donated to the CMA, along with part of its collection. The museum opened as a part of the Columbus Museum of Art that year. The museum and its Pizzuti Collection branch temporarily closed beginning in March 2020 due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. Ross Building layout and architecture The 1931 museum building, today known as the Elizabeth M. and Richard M. Ross Building, was designed in the Second Renaissance Revival style by Columbus architects Richards, McCarty and Bulford. It has a concrete foundation, walls of limestone and concrete, and a truncated copper hipped roof. The building is horizontal, two stories high, and has a central structure advanced several feet in front of its two wings. The wings feature large limestone friezes, together known as The Frederick W. Schumacher Frieze or Masters of Art. The work, by Robert Ingersoll Aitken, depicts 68 artists from 490 B.C. to 1925 A.D. The original main entryway consists of three arched portals to the interior. The facade here includes decorative moldings, keystones, bulls-eye medallions, and stone quoins. A frieze hung above the arches, with the name \\"Columbus Gallery of Fine Arts\\". A set of sixteen limestone steps leads to the sidewalk, flanked by two Italian-style lamp posts. The Center for Creativity, on the first floor of the museum, includes a Creativity Lounge, The Studio, The Wonder Room, the Big Idea Gallery, and an Open Gallery.

The term dates from the early 20th century and is used almost exclusively to characterize certain marriages of public celebrities in the first half of the 20th century, primarily before World War II, when public attitudes made it impossible for a person acknowledging homosexuality to pursue a public career, notably in the Hollywood film industry.Claude J. Summers, The Queer Encyclopedia of Film & Television (Cleis Press, 2005), p. 132 One of the earliest uses of the phrase appeared in the British press in 1895, at a time when the colour was associated with homosexuality. Usage With the inclusion of morality clauses in the contracts of Hollywood actors in the 1920s, some closeted stars contracted marriages of convenience to protect their public reputations and preserve their careers. A noteworthy exception that demonstrated the precarious position of the public homosexual was that of William Haines, who brought his career to a sudden end at the age of 35. He refused to end his relationship with his male partner, Jimmy Shields, and enter into a marriage at the direction of his studio employer, Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer. The term lavender marriage has been used to characterize these couples/individuals: * The 1923 marriage of Rudolph Valentino with lesbian costume and set designer Natacha Rambova disguised her relationship with actress Alla Nazimova as well as his alleged bisexuality. * The English broadcaster and journalist Nancy Spain considered entering a lavender marriage to disguise her relationship with Joan Werner Laurie, a magazine and book editor. * The marriage of Robert Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck supposedly disguised the purported bisexuality of both and has been characterized as lavender for that reason, but it was prompted by the need to protect both their reputations after a Photoplay magazine article reported they had been living together for years while unmarried. * Actor Rock Hudson, troubled by rumors that Confidential magazine was planning to expose his homosexuality, married Phyllis Gates, a young woman employed by his agent, in 1955. Gates insisted until the time of her own death that she had had no idea the marriage was anything other than legitimate. * The term has been applied to the marriage of Tyrone Power and French actress Annabella in 1939. * American theater actress and producer Katharine Cornell married stage director Guthrie McClintic in 1921. She appeared only in productions he directed, and they lived together in their Manhattan townhouse until his death in 1961. * Swedish Hollywood actor Nils Asther and vaudeville entertainer Vivian Duncan had a brief marriage of convenience that resulted in one child; Asther was a well known homosexual who had a relationship with actor/stuntman Kenneth DuMain.Nils Asther memoirs \\"Narrens väg - Ingen gudasaga\\", 1988, Sweden.

In March 1996, Alig and his roommate, Robert D. \\"Freeze\\" Riggs, killed fellow Club Kid Andre \\"Angel\\" Melendez in a confrontation over a delinquent drug debt. In October 1997, Alig pled guilty to first-degree manslaughter. Both men were sentenced to 10 to 20 years in prison; Riggs was released on parole in 2010, Alig on May 5, 2014. Early years Born and raised in South Bend, Indiana, Alig is the second of two sons born to John and Elke Alig. His mother, a native of Bremerhaven, Germany, moved to the United States after marrying his father, a computer programmer. The couple divorced when Alig was four years old. Alig attended Grissom Middle School and Penn High School, where he was a straight A student and graduated in the top 8% of his class.Owen (2004), pp.125, 128 During his teenage years, Alig reported that he was often bullied because of his homosexuality. Seeking a less conservative social environment after graduating in 1984, he attended Fordham University in New York City. He studied architecture there before transferring to the Fashion Institute of Technology. There, he met the boyfriend of artist Keith Haring, who introduced Alig to New York City nightlife. Alig soon dropped out of school and began working at Danceteria as a bus boy.Owen (2004), p.128 Underground club scene Alig's Club Kids While working at Danceteria, Alig studied the nightclub business and soon became a party promoter. His ability to stage memorable parties helped him rise in New York's party scene. During this time, Alig and other regular clubgoers began creating flamboyant personas, and later became known as \\"Club Kids\\". The Club Kids wore outrageous costumes that former Club Kid and celebutante James St. James later described as \\"part drag, part clown, part infantilism\\". They were also known for their frequent use of ketamine (known as Special K), Ecstasy, Rohypnol, heroin, and cocaine. Alig's Club Kids included (among others): \\"Ernie Glam\\", \\"Gitsie\\", \\"Jennytalia\\", \\"Superstar DJ Keoki\\", Amanda Lepore, Charlie \\"Dash\\" Prestano, Joshua Davis \\"Richie Rich\\", Robert \\"Freeze\\" Riggs, RuPaul, and \\"Walt Paper\\". The Club Kids' outrageousness became a source of interest for the media, and articles about them appeared in such media outlets as Newsweek, People, and TIME. They also appeared on Donahue, Geraldo, and The Joan Rivers Show. In 1988, Alig was hired by the owner of The Limelight, Peter Gatien. Alig's parties at The Limelight were such a hit that he began organizing parties for Gatien's other clubs: Club USA, the Palladium, and Tunnel. Alig's notorious \\"Outlaw Parties\\", which were thrown in various unconventional places including a Burger King, a Dunkin' Donuts, abandoned houses, and a subway, helped to revitalize the downtown New York City club scene which Village Voice columnist Michael Musto declared had atrophied after artist Andy Warhol died in 1987. Alig's parties also became notorious due in part to his own \\"bad behavior\\". Alig would throw $100 bills on crowded dance floors just to watch people scramble for them. In other instances, he would urinate on clubgoers or urinate in their drinks, and would engage in stage falls wherein he knocked others to the ground. As Alig's popularity in the club scene grew, so did his drug use. He was arrested several times for drug offenses and entered rehab, but continued to use drugs. In 1995, his boss, Gatien, sent Alig to rehab once again. Alig later claimed that after he completed his stint and was released, Gatien fired him. Some of Alig's behavior could be explained by a personality disorder; he reports being diagnosed with histrionic personality disorder, stating: \\"The doctor said I was the most extreme case he'd ever seen. Everything has to be completely over the top and exaggerated. It worked well for my job – I was a promoter.\\" Killing of Angel Melendez Alig murdered Angel Melendez (pictured) and dismembered his body Andre \\"Angel\\" Melendez was a regular on the New York City club scene and worked at The Limelight, among other clubs (some not owned by Gatien, e.g., Webster HallGlory Daze: The Life and Yimes of Michael Alig (2015)), where he sold drugs on the premises. After The Limelight was closed by federal agents and an investigation found that Gatien was allowing drugs to be sold there, Melendez was fired. Shortly thereafter, he moved into Alig's Riverbank West apartment On the night of March 17, 1996, Alig and his roommate, Robert D. \\"Freeze\\" Riggs, killed Melendez after an argument in Alig's apartment over many things, including a long-standing drug debt. Riggs' written confession to the police Alig has claimed many times that he was so high on drugs that his memory of the events is unclear. After Melendez's death, Alig and Riggs did not know what to do with the body. They initially left it in the bathtub, which they filled with ice. After a few days, the body began to decompose and became malodorous. After discussing what to do with Melendez's body and who should do it, Riggs went to Macy's to buy knives and a box. In exchange for 10 bags of heroin, Alig agreed to dismember Melendez's body. He cut his legs off and put them each in a separate garbage bag, then into separate duffel bags and threw them into the Hudson River. The rest of the body was put into a large box Riggs found in the basement of their apartment. Afterwards, he and Riggs threw the box into the Hudson River. In the weeks following Melendez's disappearance, Alig allegedly told \\"anyone who would listen\\" that he and Riggs had killed him. Most people did not believe Alig and thought his \\"confession\\" was a ploy to get attention. However, Michael Musto recalls: \\"By the time Alig sent out a party invite joking about the murder, a lot of people wanted to kill him (especially since a source was floating a more premeditated version of the killing).\\" Investigation and arrest On April 26, 1996, Musto reported rumors of Alig's involvement in Melendez's death in a blind item, in his Village Voice column. Although no names were used, Musto's reports included the details of the murder. Musto had previously reported on Alig's firing from The Limelight and noted the buzz about a missing club person. The following day, the New York Posts \\"Page Six\\" column ran a lead item about the murder mystery, citing Musto's reporting as well as a New York magazine piece quoting an evasive Alig. Over the coming weeks, the Village Voice continued to report and make accusations about Melendez's murder. Through September 1996, the police still had not questioned Alig about the murder; they were focused on his business partner, Peter Gatien, wanting Alig to testify against him. Since several months had passed, many people believed Alig would get away with murdering Melendez, until children playing in the water pulled a box containing a legless torso from the waters of Oakwood Beach at Miller Field, in New Dorp, Staten Island. James St. James recounted how Melendez's brother was baffled by what he regarded as callous indifference by the police and by the scenesters Melendez had considered friends. In November 1996, the coroner reported the body had been identified as Andre \\"Angel\\" Melendez. Alig fled New York, but was located by police in a motel room rented by his drug dealer boyfriend, Brian, in Toms River, New Jersey. Alig was arrested as was Riggs. Shortly after his arrest, Riggs confessed to police: According to Riggs, he hit Melendez a total of three times on the head with the hammer. Then Alig grabbed a pillow and tried to smother him. While Melendez was unconscious, Riggs went to the other room; when he returned, he noticed a broken syringe on the floor. Riggs claimed that Alig was pouring \\"some cleaner or chemical\\" into Melendez' mouth, then duct- taped it with the help of Riggs. Alig disputes these claims, however, and cites the \\"Draino in the hypodermic needle\\" as one of the key dramatizations in Disco Bloodbath and Party Monster. Alig claimed he killed Melendez in self- defense and helped to dispose of the body in a panic. Prosecutors were hesitant to charge Alig with first-degree murder, as they still hoped he would testify against his former boss, Peter Gatien, who had been arrested for allowing drugs to be sold in his nightclubs. They eventually offered both Alig and Riggs a plea deal: a sentence of 10 to 20 years if they accepted the lesser charge of manslaughter. On October 1, 1997, both pleaded guilty and were sentenced to 10 to 20 years. While in prison, Alig told journalist Michael Musto, \\"I know why I blabbed. I must have wanted to stop me. I was spinning out of control. It's like the old saying 'What do you have to do to get attention around here - kill somebody?'\\" Prison While incarcerated in the New York State prison system, Alig was transferred from prison to prison; he also spent time in the psychiatric ward at Rikers Island. In 2000, at Southport Correctional Facility, he was placed in solitary confinement after he was caught using heroin. He remained in solitary for another two and a half years after a drug test showed that he was still using drugs. In August 2004, Alig's longtime friend and mentor, James St. James, began a blog entitled \\"Phone Calls From a Felon\\". The blog contained transcripts of phone conversations between Alig and St. James about Alig's experiences in prison. After six weeks, Alig put a stop to the phone calls claiming, \\"People think I'm having a grand old time. Or that I'm trying to exploit my situation.\\" He was moved to Elmira Correctional Facility that year.https://nymag.com/news/people/24365/index2.html Alig became eligible for parole in 2006. His first parole request, in November 2006, was denied, reportedly after parole officers watched the film Party Monster (2003), a fictionalized account of Alig's life, starring Macaulay Culkin. He was again denied parole in July 2008 after failing several drug tests. In an interview with his former fellow prisoner, Daniel Genis, Alig said that his time spent reading while in solitary inspired him to write his memoirs, which he titled Aligula, and he particularly identified with the character Raskolnikov from Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment. In March 2009, Alig said he finally decided to stop using drugs and that he had been sober since then. Post-prison life Alig was paroled on May 5, 2014. Per the conditions of his parole, Alig returned to New York City. He was required to abide by an 8 p.m. curfew and undergo drug and anger management counseling, and job readiness training. In the months following his release, Alig granted numerous interviews in which he expressed a desire to star in his own reality show and stage an exhibition of his artwork. In May 2014, reports emerged that Alig was attempting to sell his memoirs and was pursuing a career as a magazine writer. Since September 7, 2014, Alig and fellow Club Kid Ernie Glam have hosted a YouTube comedy talk show titled \\"The Pee-ew\\". On October 15, 2014, Alig released the pop song, \\"What's In (Featuring DJ Keoki)\\", written and produced by Greg Tanoose, through Austound Music, an Austin, Texas, based record label. An EP, also entitled What's In, was released. In May 2015, a selection of Alig's paintings went on display at the SELECT Fair in New York. On February 2, 2017, Alig was arrested for trespassing and smoking crystal meth in Joyce Kilmer Park in Concourse, outside the Bronx Supreme Court, at approximately 1:30 a.m. He was detained because the park closes after dusk. The complaint alleges that \\"police found a bag of crystal meth and a pipe with residue from the drug in his jacket pocket\\". The New York Daily News reported that Alig was arraigned on drug possession and trespass charges, and pleaded guilty to trespass in exchange for a conditional discharge. In popular culture Books *The events of Alig's years as a club promoter up to his arrest are covered in James St. James' memoir, Disco Bloodbath: A Fabulous but True Tale of Murder in Clubland (1999), re-published with the title Party Monster after the release of the eponymous 2003 film. Films *The events of Alig's years as a club promoter up to his arrest were portrayed in the documentary, produced and directed by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato, Party Monster: The Shockumentary (1998) and the subsequent feature film, also produced, directed, and written by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato, Party Monster (2003), starring Macaulay Culkin as Alig and Seth Green as St. James, as well as the documentary film Glory Daze: The Life and Times of Michael Alig (2015) in January, 2018 available on Netflix streaming. *A prison interview with Alig is featured in the documentary Limelight (2011), directed by Billy Corben and co-produced by Peter Gatien's daughter, Jen Gatien . *Michael Alig is cast as \\"Michael\\" in Spanish NY based independent director Manuel Toledano's first and only movie (finished in 1998 with the participation of producer Elias Querejeta), called \\"Shampoo Horns\\" (Cuernos de Espuma, 1998). The film portrayed those years and the Club Kids fad, partly as fiction, partly as a documentary. The shooting was done during 1996, and Michael Alig was supposed to be acting during the same period he committed his real-life crime.

Early life Hacker was born September 19, 1935 in Washington, D.C. His father, C. Leroy Hacker, was an author, Baptist pastor and a chaplain in the U.S. Army. His mother, Alzeda (Crockett) Hacker, was an accomplished musician. Of their three children, Benjamin was the eldest. Benjamin attended Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio, graduating in 1957 with a B.A. Degree in Science. He married his wife, Jeanne, in 1958. Naval Service After completing the Navy's Aviation Officer Candidate School in Pensacola, Florida in September 1958, Hacker was commissioned Ensign and subsequently received the designation of Naval Aviation Observer (NAO). Hacker gained experience as a Navigator and Tactical Coordinator in SP-2H \\"Neptune\\" and P-3C \\"Orion\\" aircraft through numerous operational assignments in the far reaches of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and Mediterranean Sea. He took command of the United States Naval Facility, Barbados, West Indies on July 2, 1968. In 1972, he established the Naval ROTC Unit at Florida A & M University, in Tallahassee, Florida and served as the first Commanding Officer and Professor of Naval Science of this unit. In 1974 he became Commanding Officer of Patrol Squadron 24 (VP-24), a P-3C Orion Squadron stationed in Jacksonville, Florida and was promoted to Captain following his squadron command tour. In June 1978, he completed studies in National Security Policy at the Industrial College of the Armed Forces, and earned a Masters of Science Degree in Administration from George Washington University in Washington, D.C. In August 1978, he was assigned as Commanding Officer, Naval Air Station, Brunswick, Maine. In 1980, then-Captain Hacker was selected for promotion to Rear Admiral and assumed duties as Commander, U.S. Military Enlistment Processing Command with headquarters in Fort Sheridan, Illinois.

This analogous structure is referred to as an n-qubit register. The graphical depiction of quantum circuit elements is described using a variant of the Penrose graphical notation.  Reversible classical logic gates  The elementary logic gates of a classical computer, other than the NOT gate, are not reversible. Thus, for instance, for an AND gate one cannot always recover the two input bits from the output bit; for example, if the output bit is 0, we cannot tell from this whether the input bits are 0,1 or 1,0 or 0,0. However, reversible gates in classical computers are easily constructed for bit strings of any length; moreover, these are actually of practical interest, since irreversible gates must always increase physical entropy. A reversible gate is a reversible function on n-bit data that returns n-bit data, where an n-bit data is a string of bits x1,x2, ...,xn of length n. The set of n-bit data is the space {0,1}n, which consists of 2n strings of 0's and 1's. More precisely: an n-bit reversible gate is a bijective mapping f from the set {0,1}n of n-bit data onto itself. An example of such a reversible gate f is a mapping that applies a fixed permutation to its inputs. For reasons of practical engineering, one typically studies gates only for small values of n, e.g. n=1, n=2 or n=3. These gates can be easily described by tables.  Quantum logic gates  To define quantum gates, we first need to specify the quantum replacement of an n-bit datum. The quantized version of classical n-bit space {0,1}n is the Hilbert space :H_{\\\\operatorname{QB}(n)}= \\\\ell^2(\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^n). This is by definition the space of complex-valued functions on {0,1}n and is naturally an inner product space. This space can also be regarded as consisting of linear superpositions of classical bit strings. Note that HQB(n) is a vector space over the complex numbers of dimension 2n. The elements of this space are called n-qubits. Using Dirac ket notation, if x1,x2, ...,xn is a classical bit string, then :  x_1, x_2, \\\\cdots,x_n \\\\rangle \\\\quad is a special n-qubit corresponding to the function which maps this classical bit string to 1 and maps all other bit strings to 0; these 2n special n-qubits are called computational basis states. All n-qubits are complex linear combinations of these computational basis states. Quantum logic gates, in contrast to classical logic gates, are always reversible. One requires a special kind of reversible function, namely a unitary mapping, that is, a linear transformation of a complex inner product space that preserves the Hermitian inner product. An n-qubit (reversible) quantum gate is a unitary mapping U from the space HQB(n) of n-qubits onto itself. Typically, we are only interested in gates for small values of n. A reversible n-bit classical logic gate gives rise to a reversible n-bit quantum gate as follows: to each reversible n-bit logic gate f corresponds a quantum gate Wf defined as follows: : W_f(  x_1, x_2, \\\\cdots,x_n \\\\rangle) = f(x_1, x_2, \\\\cdots, x_n) \\\\rangle. Note that Wf permutes the computational basis states. Of particular importance is the controlled NOT gate (also called CNOT gate) WCNOT defined on a quantized 2 qubit. Other examples of quantum logic gates derived from classical ones are the Toffoli gate and the Fredkin gate. However, the Hilbert-space structure of the qubits permits many quantum gates that are not induced by classical ones. For example, a relative phase shift is a 1 qubit gate given by multiplication by the unitary matrix: : U_\\\\theta =\\\\begin{bmatrix} e^{i \\\\theta} & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}, so : U_\\\\theta  0 \\\\rangle = e^{i \\\\theta}  0 \\\\rangle \\\\quad U_\\\\theta  1 \\\\rangle =  1 \\\\rangle.  Reversible logic circuits  Again, we consider first reversible classical computation. Conceptually, there is no difference between a reversible n-bit circuit and a reversible n-bit logic gate: either one is just an invertible function on the space of n bit data. However, as mentioned in the previous section, for engineering reasons we would like to have a small number of simple reversible gates, that can be put together to assemble any reversible circuit. To explain this assembly process, suppose we have a reversible n-bit gate f and a reversible m-bit gate g. Putting them together means producing a new circuit by connecting some set of k outputs of f to some set of k inputs of g as in the figure below. In that figure, n=5, k=3 and m=7. The resulting circuit is also reversible and operates on n+m−k bits. 175px We will refer to this scheme as a classical assemblage (This concept corresponds to a technical definition in Kitaev's pioneering paper cited below). In composing these reversible machines, it is important to ensure that the intermediate machines are also reversible. This condition assures that intermediate \\"garbage\\" is not created (the net physical effect would be to increase entropy, which is one of the motivations for going through this exercise). Now it is possible to show that the Toffoli gate is a universal gate. This means that given any reversible classical n-bit circuit h, we can construct a classical assemblage of Toffoli gates in the above manner to produce an (n+m)-bit circuit f such that : f(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n, \\\\underbrace{0, \\\\dots, 0}) = (y_1, \\\\ldots, y_n, \\\\underbrace{0, \\\\ldots , 0}) where there are m underbraced zeroed inputs and :(y_1, \\\\ldots, y_n) = h(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n). Notice that the end result always has a string of m zeros as the ancilla bits. No \\"rubbish\\" is ever produced, and so this computation is indeed one that, in a physical sense, generates no entropy. This issue is carefully discussed in Kitaev's article. More generally, any function f (bijective or not) can be simulated by a circuit of Toffoli gates. Obviously, if the mapping fails to be injective, at some point in the simulation (for example as the last step) some \\"garbage\\" has to be produced. For quantum circuits a similar composition of qubit gates can be defined. That is, associated to any classical assemblage as above, we can produce a reversible quantum circuit when in place of f we have an n-qubit gate U and in place of g we have an m-qubit gate W. See illustration below: 300px The fact that connecting gates this way gives rise to a unitary mapping on n+m−k qubit space is easy to check. In a real quantum computer the physical connection between the gates is a major engineering challenge, since it is one of the places where decoherence may occur. There are also universality theorems for certain sets of well-known gates; such a universality theorem exists, for instance, for the pair consisting of the single qubit phase gate Uθ mentioned above (for a suitable value of θ), together with the 2-qubit CNOT gate WCNOT. However, the universality theorem for the quantum case is somewhat weaker than the one for the classical case; it asserts only that any reversible n-qubit circuit can be approximated arbitrarily well by circuits assembled from these two elementary gates. Note that there are uncountably many possible single qubit phase gates, one for every possible angle θ, so they cannot all be represented by a finite circuit constructed from {Uθ, WCNOT)}.  Quantum computations  So far we have not shown how quantum circuits are used to perform computations. Since many important numerical problems reduce to computing a unitary transformation U on a finite- dimensional space (the celebrated discrete Fourier transform being a prime example), one might expect that some quantum circuit could be designed to carry out the transformation U. In principle, one needs only to prepare an n qubit state ψ as an appropriate superposition of computational basis states for the input and measure the output Uψ. Unfortunately, there are two problems with this: * One cannot measure the phase of ψ at any computational basis state so there is no way of reading out the complete answer. This is in the nature of measurement in quantum mechanics. * There is no way to efficiently prepare the input state ψ. This does not prevent quantum circuits for the discrete Fourier transform from being used as intermediate steps in other quantum circuits, but the use is more subtle. In fact quantum computations are probabilistic. We now provide a mathematical model for how quantum circuits can simulate probabilistic but classical computations. Consider an r-qubit circuit U with register space HQB(r). U is thus a unitary map :H_{\\\\operatorname{QB}(r)} \\\\rightarrow H_{\\\\operatorname{QB}(r)}. In order to associate this circuit to a classical mapping on bitstrings, we specify * An input register X = {0,1}m of m (classical) bits. * An output register Y = {0,1}n of n (classical) bits. The contents x = x1, ..., xm of the classical input register are used to initialize the qubit register in some way. Ideally, this would be done with the computational basis state : \\\\vec{x},0\\\\rangle=  x_1, x_2, \\\\cdots, x_{m}, \\\\underbrace{0, \\\\dots, 0} \\\\rangle, where there are r-m underbraced zeroed inputs. Nevertheless, this perfect initialization is completely unrealistic. Let us assume therefore that the initialization is a mixed state given by some density operator S which is near the idealized input in some appropriate metric, e.g. : \\\\operatorname{Tr}\\\\left(\\\\big\\\\vec{x},0\\\\rangle \\\\langle \\\\vec{x},0  - S\\\\big\\\\right) \\\\leq \\\\delta. Similarly, the output register space is related to the qubit register, by a Y valued observable A. Note that observables in quantum mechanics are usually defined in terms of projection valued measures on R; if the variable happens to be discrete, the projection valued measure reduces to a family {Eλ} indexed on some parameter λ ranging over a countable set. Similarly, a Y valued observable, can be associated with a family of pairwise orthogonal projections {Ey} indexed by elements of Y. such that : I = \\\\sum_{y \\\\in Y} \\\\operatorname{E}_y. Given a mixed state S, there corresponds a probability measure on Y given by : \\\\operatorname{Pr}\\\\\\\\{y\\\\\\\\} = \\\\operatorname{Tr}(S \\\\operatorname{E}_y ). The function F:X → Y is computed by a circuit U:HQB(r) → HQB(r) to within ε if and only if for all bitstrings x of length m :\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\vec{x},0 \\\\big U^* \\\\operatorname{E}_{F(x)} U \\\\big\\\\vec{x},0 \\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\operatorname{E}_{F(x)} U( \\\\vec{x},0\\\\rangle) \\\\big U( \\\\vec{x},0\\\\rangle) \\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\geq 1 - \\\\epsilon. Now : \\\\left \\\\operatorname{Tr} (S U^* \\\\operatorname{E}_{F(x)} U) - \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\vec{x},0 \\\\big U^* \\\\operatorname{E}_{F(x)} U \\\\big\\\\vec{x},0 \\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\right\\\\leq \\\\operatorname{Tr} (\\\\big\\\\vec{x},0\\\\rangle \\\\langle \\\\vec{x},0  - S\\\\big) \\\\ U^* \\\\operatorname{E}_{F(x)} U \\\\ \\\\leq \\\\delta so that :\\\\operatorname{Tr} (S U^* \\\\operatorname{E}_{F(x)} U) \\\\geq 1 - \\\\epsilon - \\\\delta. Theorem. If ε + δ < 1/2, then the probability distribution : \\\\operatorname{Pr}\\\\\\\\{y\\\\\\\\} = \\\\operatorname{Tr} (S U^* \\\\operatorname{E}_{y} U) on Y can be used to determine F(x) with an arbitrarily small probability of error by majority sampling, for a sufficiently large sample size. Specifically, take k independent samples from the probability distribution Pr on Y and choose a value on which more than half of the samples agree. The probability that the value F(x) is sampled more than k/2 times is at least : 1 - e^{- 2 \\\\gamma^2 k}, where γ = 1/2 - ε - δ. This follows by applying the Chernoff bound.

Heemeyer had feuded with Granby town officials, particularly over fines for violating city health ordinances when he chose to improperly dump sewage from his business instead of connecting to the city sewer system. His feud came to a head on June 4, 2004. Over about eighteen months Heemeyer had secretly modified a Komatsu D355A bulldozer by adding layers of steel and concrete, intended to serve as armor. He used this to demolish the Granby town hall, the former mayor's house, and several other buildings. Heemeyer's rampage concluded with his suicide, after his bulldozer became trapped in the basement of a hardware store he had been in the process of destroying. Background Marvin Heemeyer was born on October 28, 1951, in South Dakota and lived in Grand Lake, Colorado, about away from Granby. According to a neighbor, Heemeyer moved to town more than ten years before the incident. His friends stated that he had no relatives in the Granby–Grand Lake area. John Bauldree, a friend of Heemeyer's, said that he was a likable person. Heemeyer's brother Ken stated that he \\"would bend over backwards for anyone.\\" However, while many people described Heemeyer as an affable person, local resident Christie Baker claimed that her husband was threatened by Heemeyer after refusing to pay for a disputed muffler repair. Baker said her husband later paid Heemeyer $124 via an intermediary. Zoning dispute In 1992, Heemeyer purchased of land from the Resolution Trust Corporation, the federal agency organized to handle the assets of failed savings and loan associations, for $42,000 to build a muffler shop. He subsequently agreed to sell the land to Cody Docheff to build a concrete batch plant, Mountain Park Concrete, for $250,000. According to Susan Docheff, Heemeyer changed his mind and increased the price to $375,000, then to a deal worth approximately $1 million. Some believed that this negotiation happened before the rezoning proposal was heard by the town council. In 2001, Granby's zoning commission and trustees approved the construction of the concrete plant. Heemeyer unsuccessfully appealed the decision, claiming the construction blocked access to his shop. He was subsequently fined $2,500 by the town council and a city judge for various violations, including \\"not being hooked up to the sewer line\\"; he had initially been unable to connect to the new sewer line as the line ran away from his property and the city expected him to pay the nearly $80,000 cost of laying the connector. After the concrete plant was built the city council denied him the easement necessary to join to the new line underneath it. Bulldozer modification Heemeyer used this armor-plated Komatsu D355A bulldozer to destroy 13 buildings in Granby, Colorado. Heemeyer's bulldozer was a modified Komatsu D355A, which he referred to as the \\"MK Tank\\" in audio recordings, fitted with makeshift armor plating covering the cabin, engine, and parts of the tracks. In places, this armor was over thick, consisting of 5000-PSI Quikrete concrete mix sandwiched between sheets of tool steel (acquired from an automotive dealer in Denver), to make ad-hoc composite armor. This made the machine impervious to small arms fire and resistant to explosives. Three external explosions and more than 200 rounds of ammunition fired at the bulldozer had no effect on it. For visibility, the bulldozer was fitted with several video cameras linked to two monitors mounted on the vehicle's dashboard. The cameras were protected on the outside by shields of clear bulletproof lexan. Compressed-air nozzles were fitted to blow dust away from the video cameras. Onboard fans and an air conditioner were used to keep Heemeyer cool while driving. He had made three gun-ports, fitted for a .50 caliber rifle, a .308 semi-automatic rifle, and a .22LR rifle, all fitted with a steel plate. Heemeyer apparently had no intention of leaving the cabin once he entered it. Authorities initially speculated that he may have used a homemade crane – found in his garage – to lower the armor hull over the dozer and himself. \\"Once he tipped that lid shut, he knew he wasn't getting out,\\" Daly said. Investigators searched the garage where they believed that Heemeyer built the vehicle and found cement and armor steel. \\"It is interesting to observe that I was never caught\\", Heemeyer wrote. \\"This was a part-time project over a year time period.\\" He was surprised that several men, who had visited the shed late the previous year, had not noticed the modified bulldozer \\"especially with the 2000-pound [900kg] lift fully exposed … somehow their vision was clouded.\\" Demolition On June 4, 2004, Heemeyer drove his armored bulldozer through the wall of his former business, the concrete plant, the town hall, the office of the local newspaper that editorialized against him, the home of a former mayor (in which the mayor's widow then resided), and a hardware store owned by another man Heemeyer named in a lawsuit, as well as a few others. Heemeyer had leased his business to a trash company and sold the property several months before the rampage. The attack lasted for two hours and seven minutes, damaging thirteen buildings, knocking out natural gas service to the town hall and the concrete plant, damaging a truck, and destroying part of a utility service center. Despite the great damage to property, no one besides Heemeyer was killed in the event (by a self-inflicted gunshot wound). However, the modified bulldozer came to be known as \\"Killdozer\\" after the name of a short story by Theodore Sturgeon. The damage was estimated at $7 million. According to Grand County commissioner James Newberry, emergency dispatchers used the reverse 911 emergency system to notify many residents and property owners of the rampage going on in the town. Defenders of Heemeyer's contended that he made a point of not hurting anybody during his bulldozer rampage; Ian Daugherty, a bakery owner, said Heemeyer \\"went out of his way\\" not to harm anyone. Others offered different views. The sheriff's department argued the fact that no one was injured was not due to good intent as much as to good luck. Heemeyer had installed two rifles in firing ports on the inside of the bulldozer, and fired fifteen bullets from his rifle at power transformers and propane tanks. \\"Had these tanks ruptured and exploded, anyone within one-half mile (800 m) of the explosion could have been endangered,\\" the sheriff's department said. Twelve police officers and residents of a senior citizens complex were within such a range. Heemeyer fired many bullets from his semi-automatic rifle at Cody Docheff when Docheff tried to stop the assault on his concrete plant by using a wheel tractor-scraper, which was pushed aside by Heemeyer's bulldozer. Later, Heemeyer fired on two state patrol officers before they had fired at him. The sheriff's department also noted that eleven of the thirteen buildings Heemeyer bulldozed were occupied until moments before their destruction. At the town library, for example, a children's program was in progress when the incident began. One officer dropped a flash-bang grenade down the bulldozer's exhaust pipe, with no apparent effect. Local and state patrol, including a SWAT team, walked behind and beside the bulldozer, occasionally firing, but the armored bulldozer was impervious to their shots. Attempts to disable the bulldozer's cameras with gunfire failed as the bullets were unable to penetrate the 3-inch (7.6 cm) bulletproof plastic. At one point, undersheriff Glenn Trainor climbed atop the bulldozer and rode it \\"like a bronc buster, trying to figure out a way to get a bullet inside the dragon\\". However, he was forced to jump off to avoid being hit with debris. At this point, local authorities and the Colorado State Patrol feared they were running out of options in terms of firepower, and that Heemeyer would soon turn against civilians in Granby. Governor Bill Owens allegedly considered authorizing the National Guard to use either an Apache attack helicopter equipped with a Hellfire missile or a two-man fire team equipped with a Javelin anti-tank missile to destroy the bulldozer. This was quickly deemed unnecessary when Heemeyer became trapped in the basement of a Gambles hardware store. As late as 2011, Governor Owens's staff still vehemently denied considering such a course of action, but since then members of the State Patrol revealed that, to the contrary, the governor did consider authorizing an attack but ultimately decided against it due to the potential for collateral damage of a missile strike in the heart of Granby being significantly higher than what Heemeyer could have caused with his bulldozer. Two problems arose as Heemeyer destroyed the Gambles hardware store. The radiator of the bulldozer had been damaged and the engine was leaking various fluids, and Gambles had a small basement. The bulldozer's engine failed, and Heemeyer dropped one tread into the basement, but could not get out. About a minute later, one of the SWAT team members, who had swarmed around the machine, reported hearing a single gunshot from inside the sealed cab. It was later determined that Heemeyer had shot himself in the head with a .357-caliber handgun. Police first used explosives in an attempt to remove the steel plates, but after the third explosion failed, they cut through them with an oxyacetylene cutting torch. Grand County Emergency Management Director Jim Holahan stated that authorities were able to access and remove Heemeyer's body at 2 a.m. on June 5. Fate of the bulldozer On April 19, 2005, the town announced plans to scrap Heemeyer's bulldozer. The plan involved dispersing individual pieces to many separate scrap yards to prevent souvenir-taking. Motivation In addition to writings that he left on the wall of his shed, Heemeyer recorded a number of audio tapes explaining his motivation for the attack. He mailed these to his brother in South Dakota shortly before stepping into his bulldozer. Heemeyer's brother turned the tapes over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), who in turn sent them to the Grand County Sheriff's Department. The tapes were released by the Grand County Sheriff's Office on August 31, 2004. The tapes are about 2.5 hours in length. The first recording was made on April 13, 2004. The last recording was made thirteen days before the rampage on May 22. \\"God built me for this job,\\" Heemeyer said in the first recording. He also said it was God's plan that he not be married or have a family so that he could be in a position to carry out such an attack. \\"I think God will bless me to get the machine done, to drive it, to do the stuff that I have to do,\\" he said. \\"God blessed me in advance for the task that I am about to undertake. It is my duty. God has asked me to do this. It's a cross that I am going to carry and I'm carrying it in God's name.\\" Investigators later found Heemeyer's handwritten list of targets. According to the police, it included the buildings he destroyed, the local Catholic church (which he did not damage), and the names of various people who had sided against him in past disputes. Notes found by investigators after the incident indicated that the primary motivation for the bulldozer rampage was his plan to stop the concrete plant from being built near his shop. These notes indicated that he held grudges over the zoning approval. \\"I was always willing to be reasonable until I had to be unreasonable\\", he wrote. \\"Sometimes reasonable men must do unreasonable things.\\" Heemeyer's words later became a meme in the far-right extremist boogaloo movement as \\"I became unreasonable.\\" In popular culture *Leviathan — According to the director of the 2014 movie, Andrey Zvyagintsev, the story of Marvin Heemeyer inspired him and it was adapted into a Russian setting.«Если больше нет юродивых, кто скажет о беззаконии и лжи?», Kommersant.ru, 14 May 2014 *Tread — 2020 documentary film based on the rampage.

The term itself is derived via Latin ' from Greek , meaning \\"additional manner of expression\\". The act of paraphrasing is also called \\"paraphrasis\\". Analysis A paraphrase typically explains or clarifies the text that is being paraphrased. For example, \\"The signal was red\\" might be paraphrased as \\"The train was not allowed to pass because the signal was red\\". A paraphrase is usually introduced with verbum decani—a declaratory expression to signal the transition to the paraphrase. For example, in \\"The signal was red, that is, the train was not allowed to proceed,\\" the that is signals the paraphrase that follows. A paraphrase does not need to accompany a direct quotation. The paraphrase typically serves to put the source's statement into perspective or to clarify the context in which it appeared. A paraphrase is typically more detailed than a summary. One should add the source at the end of the sentence, for example: When the light was red, trains could not go (Wikipedia). Paraphrase may attempt to preserve the essential meaning of the material being paraphrased. Thus, the (intentional or otherwise) reinterpretation of a source to infer a meaning that is not explicitly evident in the source itself qualifies as \\"original research,\\" and not as paraphrase. Unlike a metaphrase, which represents a \\"formal equivalent\\" of the source, a paraphrase represents a \\"dynamic equivalent\\" thereof. While a metaphrase attempts to translate a text literally, a paraphrase conveys the essential thought expressed in a source text​, ​if necessary, at the expense of literality. For details, see dynamic and formal equivalence. Biblical paraphrase The term is applied to the genre of Biblical paraphrases, which were the most widely circulated versions of the Bible available in medieval Europe. Here, the purpose was not to render an exact rendition of the meaning or the complete text, but to present material from the Bible in a version that was theologically orthodox and not subject to heretical interpretation, or, in most cases, to take from the Bible and present to a wide public material that was interesting, entertaining and spiritually meaningful, or, simply to abridge the text. In your own words The phrase \\"in your own words\\" is often used within this context to imply that the writer has rewritten the text in their own writing style – how they would have written it if they had created the idea. Nowadays, there are some models to learn and recognize paraphrase on natural language texts. Sentences can also be automatically paraphrased using text simplification software.Shardlow, Matthew. \\"A survey of automated text simplification.\\" International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications 4.1 (2014): 58–70.

It occurs in a wide range of open habitats, including open woodlands and human habitation, often occupying the same niche as the house sparrow does in Eurasia. The adult northern grey- headed sparrow has a pale grey head with a white moustache stripe, pale brown upperparts, whitish underparts and chestnut wings with a small white shoulder patch. The sexes are similar, but young birds are slightly duller and lack the white wing patch. There are three subspecies, differing in plumage tone, especially with regard to the darkness of the head. This sparrow is mainly resident in its range, but there is some seasonal movement, and flocks of up to 50 birds form outside the breeding season. It builds a cup nest in trees, thatch, or old nests of other birds; 2–4 eggs are laid. This species feeds principally on seeds and grain, like other sparrows, but will readily take insects including termites, especially when feeding young. The calls include cheeps and chirps, and the typical sparrow churring alarm call. The northern grey-headed sparrow is replaced in eastern and southern Africa by very similar birds that are sometimes considered races of this species: Swainson's sparrow, the parrot-billed sparrow, the Swahili sparrow, and the southern grey-headed sparrow. According to phylogenetic studies by Arnaiz-Villena et al., this species is indeed related to the other grey-headed sparrows, and these species together are most closely related within genus Passer to the house sparrow and allies.

The cereal consists of fruit-flavored, sweetened, ground-corn pieces. The Trix trademark is also used by Yoplait for a line of similarly flavored yogurt marketed toward children. History General Mills introduced Trix in 1954 as a sugar-coated version of its popular Kix cereal. The original Trix cereal was composed of more than 46% sugar. The original cereal included three colors: \\"Orangey Orange\\" (formerly named Orange Orange), \\"Lemony Yellow\\" (formerly named Lemon Yellow), and \\"Raspberry Red\\". Five fruit shapes and colors were added over the years: \\"Grapity (or Grapey) Purple\\" (1984–present), \\"Lime Green\\" (1991-1998, 2007-2015, 2017–present), \\"Wildberry Blue\\" (1996–2007, 2018–present), \\"Berry Blue\\" (2007-2015, 2017–present), and \\"Watermelon\\" (1998-2007, 2018–present). In 1991 and again in 1995, the cereal pieces were given a brighter, more colorful look. General Mills' Yoplait division produces a Trix-branded yogurt marketed to children with sweetened fruit flavors such as \\"Watermelon Burst\\".Wegmans page for Trix Yogurt Later, Trix Swirls were introduced, with flavors such as \\"Rasp-orangey orange swirl\\" (a mix of the Orangey orange and Raspberry red flavors). A new flavor, \\"Wildberry Red Swirl\\", was introduced in 2011. Trix Swirls have since been discontinued; and the pieces in the original Trix were changed to their original 2007 flavor and shape lineup in 2014. The cereal originally used spherical cereal pieces, but in 1991 these were changed to puffed fruit-shaped pieces, presumably to avoid clashing with Berry Berry Kix when it was introduced in 1992. In 2007, Trix reverted to their original shapes in the United States. Mexico was the only country to maintain fruit-shaped pieces until around late 2018, when they were reintroduced globally. In 2015, General Mills announced it would no longer use artificial colors in its cereals, and Trix would be among the first to change. Trix would go from six colors to four because satisfactory natural alternatives were found for orange, yellow, red, and purple, but not blue or green. On September 21, 2017, General Mills announced that the six-color version of Trix cereal would be reintroduced back to the market and that artificial dyes and flavors would be utilized to do so. The four-color, non-artificial-dye/flavor version would continue to be sold. In that same announcement, General Mills said they would revert to the puffed fruit-shaped pieces, which happened around late 2018. Marketing and advertising By 1955, just one year after Trix's market debut, General Mills experimented with a rabbit puppet as a potential Trix mascot. Joe Harris, a copywriter and illustrator at the Dancer Fitzgerald Sample advertising agency, created the trademark animated Trix rabbit, who debuted in a 1959 television commercial. Harris also wrote the iconic Trix tagline, \\"Silly rabbit! Trix are for kids\\", which is still used in General Mills' commercial campaigns. Chet Stover, creative director of the Trix account at Dancer Fitzgerald Sample, fully credited Harris with creation of the Trix rabbit after viewing the new character in its 1959 television commercial. In an internal memo to Dancer Fitzgerald Sample employees, Stover wrote, \\"In a business where the only thing we have to sell are ideas, it is of first importance the credit is given where credit belongs — and Joe gets all the credit for this one.\\" Tricks, the Trix Rabbit — voiced by Mort Marshall, and later by Russell Horton — an anthropomorphic cartoon rabbit who finds children and wants to trick the children into giving him a bowl of cereal. He bursts with enthusiasm but is discovered every time. The kids always reprimand him with the signature phrase \\"Silly rabbit! Trix are for kids!\\" These ads in the late 1960s and early 1970s sometimes closed with Tricks following up with \\"And sometimes for tricky rabbits!\\" (This happened in case he managed to have a taste or he had a secret stash.) Tricks originated as a puppet before he was animated. The plight of Tricks has drawn comparisons to Sisyphus, a Greek figure who was doomed to endlessly repeat a futile task. He did succeed in obtaining and eating Trix cereal on occasion, including three times as the result of a box top mail-in contest (1968, 1976 and 1980) titled \\"Let The Rabbit Eat Trix\\". The results of the vote were overwhelmingly \\"yes\\", and Tricks was depicted in a subsequent commercial enjoying a bowl of Trix. Children who voted received a button based upon their vote in the election. In 1991, Tricks won a Tour de Trix Bicycle Race. At the end of the race, two judges are arguing about whether or not Tricks should get the prize. To decide the fate of the prize, the children are called upon to send in their votes. The result was yes and Tricks got the prize, much to his delight.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtyUWlTRmV4 In commercials from 1967, the 70s, and the 80s, Tricks disguised himself to get the cereal, employing costumes as diverse as a balloon vendor, a painter and an American Indian. One alternate slogan for the cereal was, \\"Oranges, Lemons, and Grapes I see; the fruit taste of Trix is all for me!\\". Once, Bugs Bunny helped Tricks in an attempt to get the cereal. Tricks' popularity led him to appear in commercials for other products, such as a Got Milk? advertisement, in which he disguises himself as a man (played by Harland Williams) taking Trix from a grocery store.

The genre's most popular band, Marillion, achieved mainstream success in the decade. Several bands from the genre have continued to record and tour. Characteristics Neo- progressive rock (or simply \\"neo-prog\\") is characterized by deeply emotional content, often delivered via dramatic lyrics and a generous use of imagery and theatricality on-stage. The music is mostly the product of careful composition, relying less heavily on improvised jamming. The subgenre relies very much on clean, melodic and emotional electric guitar solos, combined with keyboards. The main musical influences on the neo-prog genre are bands from the first wave of progressive rock such as early Genesis, Camel, and to a lesser extent Van der Graaf Generator and Pink Floyd. Funk, hard rock and punk rock were also influences on the genre. History In the book The Progressive Rock Files, author Jerry Lucky dedicates a chapter to neo- progressive rock with the title \\"A Neo Beginning!\\", stating that this subgenre \\"surfaced in late 1981, bearing testimony to the lasting values of this musical form\\" of progressive rock, but distinguishing it from this main genre by going on to say that \\"Sure the sound was a bit different ... a little more bite, a little more eighties\\". Later in the same book, Jerry Lucky suggested that this subgenre of progressive rock peaked in the mid-1980s: \\"As 1984 dawned all of the British neo-progressive rock bands release material. Famous neo-prog albums were Marillion's second Fugazi, Pallas' The Sentinel, Pendragon's Fly High Fall Far, Twelfth Night's Art and Illusion, Solstice's Silent Dance, Quasar's Fire in the Sky.http://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=1116 A predecessor to this genre was the Enid, who fused rock with classical but were more heavily influenced by Ralph Vaughan Williams than by more modern composers. The change of approach can be heard in the shift toward shorter compositions and a keyboard- based sound in the 1980s Rush albums Signals, Grace Under Pressure, Power Windows and Hold Your Fire. Neo-progressive bands emphasized individual solos instead of group improvisation, and they included more world-music elements. Lyrics became more personal and less esoteric. Concept albums were still created, but not as frequently and on a smaller scale. Digital synthesizers took over many of the roles formerly filled by bulkier keyboards such as Mellotrons and organs, and their modern sound tended to minimize the folk influences that had been typical of 1970s progressive rock. Heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden and Queensrÿche began to explore the mythological themes and extended concepts that had previously been the territory of progressive rock. Early neo-prog was marked by sophisticated lyrics and often dark themes. While the accessibility of neo-prog to the mainstream is debatable, the form did generally seem more radio-friendly, with shorter and less complex songs than earlier progressive rock. Nonetheless, neo-prog never achieved the heights of popular success that the first wave of progressive rock in the 1970s did, with only one band, Marillion, achieving arena status. Marillion achieved major success across Europe in particular and produced eight top ten UK albums between 1983 and 1994, peaking in popularity with their album Misplaced Childhood in 1985, which topped the UK album chart and produced two top five hit singles in the UK. The album has been called \\"the cornerstone of the entire 'neo-prog' movement\\". Following this peak, neo-prog declined in popularity as a genre, although several bands have continued to record and tour, with Marillion in particular maintaining a large cult following. Progressive rock has continued with genres such as new prog and the alternative rock band Radiohead's ambitious work has been credited with inspiring a revival of interest in progressive rock.

The musical duo Perrey and Kingsley (Jean- Jacques Perrey, 1929–2016Unterberger, Richie (2008). [ Jean-Jacques Perrey], AllMusicGuide.com and Gershon Kingsley, 1922–2019) were pioneers in the field of electronic music. They were among the first to create purely electronic music to appeal to the general public.  Musical beginnings (1938–1955)  Kingsley was born in Germany. As his father was Jewish, he fled Nazi Germany in 1938 to settle in Palestine-Land of Israel where the 15-year-old, self- taught musician began his career in music. After World War II, Kingsley emigrated to America where he became a pit conductor for Broadway musical shows after graduating from the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music. Perrey was a French accordion player and medical student who abandoned his studies after meeting Georges Jenny in Paris in 1952. Jenny was the inventor of the Ondioline, a vacuum tube-powered keyboard instrument that was a forerunner of today's synthesizers and was capable of creating an amazing variety of sounds. Its keyboard had a unique feature in that it was suspended on special springs that were capable of introducing a natural vibrato if the player moved the keyboard from side to side with the playing hand. The result was a beautiful, almost human-like vibrato that lent the Ondioline a wide range of expression. The keyboard was also pressure-sensitive, and the instrument had a knee volume lever as well. Jenny hired Perrey as a salesman and demonstrator of the new instrument. As a result, he came to the attention of French singer Édith Piaf, who sponsored him to record a demonstration tape that later facilitated him access to work and live in the United States between 1960 and 1970.  Early period (1955–1967)  Perrey and Kingsley came together during Kingsley's stint as a staff arranger at Vanguard Records, an independent label in New York City that specialized not in avant-garde music, but in folk music. At that time, Perrey was experimenting with tape loops, which he had been introduced to by the French avant-garde musician Pierre Schaeffer. Each loop was a laboriously hand-spliced assemblage of filtered sounds, pitch- manipulated sounds and sometimes even animal calls. The end result of their first collaborative effort in 1966 combined Perrey's tape loops, and his inventive melodies with Kingsley's complementary arrangements and instrumentation. The resulting album was filled with tunes that sounded like music from an animated cartoon gone berserk. Their first LP was titled The In Sound from Way Out! and was released on Vanguard Records that same year. Since this was decades before the advent of widespread digital technology, each tune took weeks of painstaking editing and splicing to produce. The twelve rather whimsical tracks bore names like \\"Unidentified Flying Object\\" and \\"The Little Man From Mars\\" in an attempt to make electronic music more accessible to the general public. In fact, \\"Unidentified Flying Object\\" and another of the album's cuts, \\"Electronic Can-Can\\" eventually became theme music for \\"Wonderama\\", a Metromedia Television children's program of the early 1970s. Though most of the melodies were original, two borrowed from the classics. \\"Swan's Splashdown\\" was based on Pyotr Tchaikovsky's \\"Dance of the Little Swans\\" while \\"Countdown At 6\\" borrowed from Amilcare Ponchielli's \\"Dance of the Hours\\", much as Allan Sherman did in 1963 with his hit recording, \\"Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh\\". The final cut on the album, \\"Visa To The Stars\\" is co- credited to \\"Andy Badale\\", who would go on to fame as Angelo Badalamenti, arranger of the music in many of David Lynch's movies. In contrast to the rest of the album, \\"Visa To The Stars\\" is a more serious gesture and lacks the unusual sound effects of the other eleven cuts. It is highly reminiscent of the style of Joe Meek and his hit, \\"Telstar\\" by The Tornados. Perrey's Ondioline carries the melody throughout. This is also comparable to Kai Winding's 1963 recording of \\"More\\", which also carries the melody on the Ondioline.  Commercial period (1967–1980)  Album cover art from The In Sound from Way Out! Their second and final collaborative effort came in 1967 with the release of Kaleidoscopic Vibrations: Electronic Pop Music from Way Out, which was re-released in 1971 under the title: Kaleidoscopic Vibrations: Spotlight on the Moog. This was a similar-sounding effort, but instead of all original compositions, the album was mostly versions of popular songs of the day. In this album, Perrey's tape loops and effects were added in post- production after Kingsley's orchestrations were recorded, a technique now commonly used by electronic artists to this day. The album was one of the first to use the new Moog modular synthesizer, a massive, complicated electronic instrument resembling an old-style telephone switchboard. The album also bore two notable singles. In fact, the Moog album was released a year and a half before the release of Wendy Carlos' ground-breaking Switched-On Bach. \\"The Savers\\" would go on to fame in 1968 as the Clio Award-winning music for a television ad for No-Cal diet drinks, and in 1972 as the theme to the American television game show The Joker's Wild. About the time \\"The Savers\\" was being used on television, engineers with the Walt Disney Company were at work on a new parade at Disneyland Park, the \\"Main Street Electrical Parade\\". The idea was to cover floats with thousands of electronically controlled colored lights and to set the show to music. Paul Beaver and then later Disney musician Don Dorsey helped rework a Perrey-Kingsley composition called \\"Baroque Hoedown\\", an upbeat, almost sparkling number best described as \\"harpsichord gone country\\". It would become the underlying theme song of the parade for the next three decades at Disneyland, Magic Kingdom, Tokyo Disneyland, Disneyland Paris, Disney California Adventure Park, with newer arrangements still heard in updated versions of the Electrical Parade at the Magic Kingdom and Tokyo Disneyland. The Don Dorsey arrangement also appeared in Disneyland's Remember... Dreams Come True fireworks show from 2005 to 2014. Yet another arrangement serves as one of two theme songs to Disney's Paint the Night Parade, which premiered at Hong Kong Disneyland in 2014, and will premiere at Disneyland on or around May 22, 2015. Several segments of Sesame Street produced in the 1970s also made use of music from The In Sound from Way Out, as did other television programs, such as The Red Skelton Show. A skit from the October 23, 1976 airing of Saturday Night Live titled \\"Jeopardy! 1999\\" used \\"Unidentified Flying Object\\" as the opening and closing themes.  Legacy  Though Perrey and Kingsley never enjoyed tremendous commercial success, their music inspired a generation of musicians and was used (and still is used) extensively in advertising. Moog Indigo, a Jean-Jacques Perrey solo album from 1970 featured a cut called \\"E.V.A.\\", co-written by \\"Andy Badale\\" (Angelo Badalamenti). This slow, funky track is one of the most sampled in hip hop and rap music history. A track on Siriusmo's 2010 release The Plasterer Of Love, titled \\"Blaue Sonne\\", features a sample of \\"Lovers Concerto\\", which features on The In Sound from Way Out! In the U.K., pioneered by Kenny Everett, DJs extensively used their tracks as continuity music or took clips for use as jingle backing from the late 1960s and early 1970s. In the United States, it is currently being used in a television ad for Zelnorm, a prescription medication for female irritable bowel syndrome. The same album produced \\"The Elephant Never Forgets\\" which is used as the theme of the Televisa sitcom, El Chavo del Ocho. Even the Beastie Boys (who asked permission from Perrey and Kingsley) used both the title and cover art of Perrey and Kingsley's first album for their own The In Sound from Way Out! album in 1996, while Smash Mouth (who didn't ask for permission) borrowed the opening riff from \\"Swan's Splashdown\\" for their 1997 hit, \\"Walkin' on the Sun\\". Gershon Kingsley's biggest contribution to mainstream pop music came in the early 1970s as the composer of \\"Popcorn\\", the single biggest hit of the American phantom-band \\"Hot Butter\\", led by American Stan Free. Their work for Vanguard is available on a three-CD set called The Out Sound from Way In! The Complete Vanguard Recordings. The bonus CD features two remixes of \\"E.V.A.\\" by Fatboy Slim, remixes of \\"Winchester Cathedral\\" and \\"Lover's Concerto\\" from Kaleidoscopic Vibrations as well as \\"Electronic Can-Can\\" and \\"Unidentified Flying Object\\", each by techno artists Eurotrash. Perrey released four new CDs in the 2000s: Eclektronics — recorded in 1997 with musician David Chazam (Basta, 2000), and Circus of Life — recorded in 1999, with musician Gilbert Sigrist (PHMP, 2000). Perrey released The Happy Electropop Music Machine (2006), and Destination Space (2008), with musician and arranger Dana Countryman. Perrey spent his last years in France, and was in high demand for lectures and concerts all over the world. In August 2006, Perrey gave a concert tour with Dana Countryman, of Seattle, San Francisco and Hollywood, to support the release of The Happy Electropop Music Machine CD. Perrey performed in Russia, in April 2007 with David Chazam, and Perrey and Countryman gave a concert in Norway in September 2007. In 2008, Perrey and Chazam performed in Bucharest, Romania, and in 2008, Perrey and Countryman gave concerts in Newcastle, England, New York City and Montreal, Canada to support the release of their Destination Space CD, also on Oglio Records. Perrey died at the age of 87 on November 4, 2016 from complications of lung cancer.Co-composer of Disney's Electrical Parade music dies. Retrieved on November 5, 2016.

Each gateway consists of a dedicated computer running custom software that is connected to both a radio and the Internet. This arrangement forms what is known as an IRLP Node. Since all end users communicate using a radio as opposed to using a computer directly, IRLP has adopted the motto \\"Keeping the Radio in Amateur Radio\\". Amateur radio (or ham) operators within radio range of a local node are able to use DTMF tone generators to initiate a node-to-node connection with any other available node in the world. Each node has a unique 4 digit node number in the range of 1000–8999. A real-time searchable list of all nodes worldwide (including their current status) is available anytime by viewing the IRLP Network at a Glance. As of February 2019, there are over 1,500 active nodes. IRLP connections are of two types: node to node, and node to reflector. Stations wishing to communicate with 3 or more nodes at the same time may accomplish this by connecting to what is called an IRLP Reflector. Reflectors are a type of conferencing system. Most reflectors on the network have 10 channels (0–9) with channel 0 being the main channel. Each reflector has a unique 4 digit node number in the range of 9000–9999. The first 3 digits consist of the reflector number, while the fourth digit represents the channel number. As of April 2007, there are 20 operational reflectors (including Echo Reflector 9990, which digitally records and plays back transmissions for testing purposes). Since most reflectors have 10 channels, there are approximately 200 unique reflector channels available for use. History IRLP was invented by David \\"Dave\\" Cameron, VE7LTD. Born and raised in West Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, Cameron attended the University of British Columbia where he joined the UBC Amateur Radio Society. He built his first repeater and computer-based repeater controller in the 1990s. Cameron installed the first three IRLP nodes in November 1997. They used the Windows operating system (OS) with VocalTec's iPhone installed. There were problems with the software, mainly in the fact that iPhone is not very stable nor is it controllable. After running iPhone for close to 6 months on active connections to Vernon, British Columbia, Canada and Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, Cameron decided to rebuild the nodes and essentially start over. This is when the Linux OS and the Speak Freely software were first tested. On November 12, 1998, the VE7RHS node was first installed in Gage Towers, UBC, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada using Linux. A few days later, the VE7RVN node came online from the residence of Michael Paul Illingby, VE7TFD in Vernon, British Columbia, Canada. Since this point, no further problems were experienced. This planted the seed for the IRLP network to grow. New nodes slowly launched across Canada, followed by the United States and worldwide. Node numbers were originally set at 3 digits in length. Due to the extensive growth of the IRLP network, an extra digit needed to be added in 2002. Existing node numbers after this change received a trailing zero. For example, if the old node number was 123, it became 1230. Most existing reflectors were also converted from single channels to 10 channels. This new type of reflector was known as a super-reflector. After all the reflectors were converted the \\"super-\\" was dropped... Requirements Computer * A dedicated IBM compatible computer, Pentium class (Intel, AMD etc.), running a processor clocked at least 200 MHz * At least 128 MB of RAM * A dedicated hard drive of at least 2 GB * Basic (legacy) parallel port running LPT1 (0x378/9) * Soundcard – most PCI cards work as do many motherboard based chipsets * Ethernet Adapter (Network Card) connected to the Internet Operating system Linux is the operating system (OS) of choice for IRLP, as it allows the best in reliability, programmability, efficiency, and functionality. Some older IRLP nodes use the Red Hat 7.3 or Red Hat 9 distribution, as they were very stable releases and ran very smoothly on any Pentium or better computer. In 2005, a custom version of Fedora Core 3 was introduced, followed by Fedora Core 5 in 2006. As of March 2007, IRLP no longer supports Red Hat and started shipping with the CentOS 4 distribution. As of December 2012, IRLP has released a final version of CentOS 4.9, but now supports Debian as its operating system of choice. This release provides greatly improved operation with more support for varying hardware. IRLP hardware An IRLP board is required to interface to the radio. Currently version 3.0 IRLP boards are available fully assembled and tested. Each board comes complete with all the cables between the board and computer parallel port (with sub-hoods) and terminates in a male DE-9 connector for interface into the radio. A cable terminated in a female DE-9 plugs into the IRLP board and interfaces to a radio/repeater/controller. Two mono or stereo 1/8\\" audio plugs connect to the computer's sound card. The audio circuitry is the owner's responsibility. The IRLP board is a very simple circuit, the most difficult part being the DTMF decoder which consists of a MT8870 (or similar) DTMF decoder IC and HCF4081 (or similar) and-gate IC. Two chips are needed because the MT8870 has latched outputs, and the IRLP software looks for short pulses at the parallel port pins 10,12,13,15 in order to acknowledge a DTMF digit. MT8870 pin 15 provides a pulse when any valid DTMF digit is decoded, so this signal is used on one input of each gate on the HCF4081. The other gate input is from MT8870 pins 11,12,13,14. The output of the HCF4081 (pins 3,4,10,11) connect to the parallel port and provide the pulsed input that IRLP needs. The IRLP software cannot decode the D digit (the bottom right key on a 16-button DTMF dial). This is a limitation of the hardware in the decoder. DTMF digit D is logic level 0 on all 4 bits from the MT8870. Thus, the parallel port pins would all be at 0 volts, which IRLP regards as no DTMF digit present. The IRLP board does not pass the MT8870's strobe pin to the PC, if it did that would enable digit D detection. The IRLP board has no audio transformers or bypass capacitors. It is merely a DTMF decoder circuit with a simple COS and PTT circuit installed. Version 3 boards also have simple FET switches for the AUX 1,2 and 3 functions.  Parallel port pin assignments  3 PTT 4 Aux pin 1 (active high at parallel port) 5 Aux pin 2 (active high at parallel port) 6 Aux pin 3 (active high at parallel port) 10 DTMF 4 11 COS (active low at parallel port on squelch open) 12 DTMF 3 13 DTMF 2 15 DTMF 1 25 Ground (Also ground DB25 shell) RF hardware A link radio or repeater is needed to interface to the IRLP board. The radio's COS (carrier operated squelch) and PTT lines must be available to the IRLP board. Additionally, courtesy tones, hang time, and node IDs must not be transmitted over the VoIP link. This can easily be accomplished using CTCSS on the repeater transmitter that follows the COS of the receiver.

British units made a night attack on the American encampment, and due in large part to the capture of the two senior officers of the American force, and an overestimation of British strength by the Americans, the battle resulted in a total victory for the British, and a turning point in the defence of Upper Canada. Background On 27 May, the Americans had won the Battle of Fort George, forcing the British defenders of Fort George into a hasty retreat. The British commander, Brigadier General John Vincent, gathered in all his outposts along the Niagara River, disbanded the militia contingents in his force and retreated to Burlington Heights (at the west end of Burlington Bay), with about 1,600 men in total. The Americans under the overall leadership of General Henry Dearborn, who was elderly and ill, were slow to pursue. A brigade under Brigadier General William H. Winder first followed up Vincent, but Winder decided that Vincent's forces were too strong to engage, and halted at the Forty Mile Creek. Another brigade joined him, commanded by Brigadier General John Chandler, who was the senior, and took overall command. Their combined force, numbering 3,400, advanced to Stoney Creek, where they encamped on 5 June.H. F. Wood, The Many Battles of Stoney Creek, in Zaslow (ed), p. 57. The two generals set up their headquarters at the gage Farm.Extract – Niles' Register – Vol 11, pp.116–119, 19 October 1816, Cruikshank, pp. 30–38. Vincent sent his Deputy Assistant Adjutant General, Lieutenant Colonel John Harvey, to reconnoitre the American position. Harvey recommended a night attack, reporting that \\"the enemy's guards were few and negligent; his line of encampment was long and broken; his artillery was feebly supported; several of his corps were placed too far to the rear to aid in repelling a blow which might be rapidly struck in front\\".Zaslow, p. 58. The American dispositions described by Harvey account for the statement in the post-battle report of the U.S. Assistant Adjutant-General that only 1,328 American troops were engaged against the British, out of Chandler's total force of 3,400. A British column of five companies from the 1/8th (King's) Regiment of Foot and the main body of the 49th Regiment of Foot, about 700 men in all, was formed. Out of the 700 soldiers fighting on the British side, 14 were Canadian locals and the remainder were British regulars.Strange Fatality: The Battle of Stoney Creek, 1813 by James Elliot, 2009 p. 260 Although Vincent accompanied the column, he placed Harvey in command. Billy Green was a resident to Stoney Creek who revealed the American countersign to the British, and guided them to their positions. At this point, the story of Billy Green comes to light. Billy Green was a 19-year-old local resident who had witnessed the advance of the Americans from the top of the Niagara Escarpment earlier in the day. Billy's brother-in-law, Isaac Corman, had been briefly captured by the Americans, but was released after he convinced them (truthfully) – Also see Genealogy of Benjamin Harrison IV – who is indicated as being grandfather to William Henry Harrison (via Benjamin Harrison V), and also to Issac Corman (via Sarah Harrison). that he was the cousin of American General William Henry Harrison. In order to be able to pass through the American lines, he was given the challenge response password for the day – \\"WIL-HEN-HAR\\" (an abbreviation of Harrison's name). He gave his word of honour that he would not divulge this to the British army. He kept his word, but did reveal the word to Billy Green, who rode his brother-in-law's horse part way, and ran on foot the rest of the way to Burlington Heights. Here, he revealed the password to Lieutenant James FitzGibbon. He was provided with a sword and uniform and used his knowledge of the terrain to guide the British to the American position.Berton, pp. 72–80. Billy Green was present at the battle. However, it has been suggested that the password was actually obtained by Lieutenant Colonel Harvey. According to an account given after the war by Frederick Snider, a neighbour of the Gages, Harvey had executed a ruse on the first sentry to be accosted. Pretending to be the American officer of the day making Grand Rounds, he approached the sentry and when challenged, came close to the sentry's ear as if to whisper the countersign. But with bayonet secreted in hand, he grabbed the surprised sentry by the throat and threw him to the ground. With the bayonet at his throat, the sentry gave up the password.Elliot Strange Fatality, p. 115. This suggestion illustrates the incomplete research into several aspects of the Battle of Stoney Creek. Snider gave this account not long before his death in 1877Clark et al., footnotes 34, 35. and his source for it was the April 1871 issue of The Canadian Literary Journal.Lubell et al., footnote 44. Snider was confusing Harvey with Colonel Murray, June 1813 with December 1813 and Stoney Creek with Youngstown near Fort Niagara. Snider makes several obvious errors, such as \\"the British General St. Vincent was found some days after wandering about in the woods nearly dead of hunger.\\" His name was Vincent and he did not wander about the woods for days. Snider's source for the provenance of the countersign should thus be considered to be unreliable. Battle British troops during the night attack were placed under the conduct and direction of Lieutenant-Colonel John Harvey. The British left their camp at Burlington Heights at 11:30 p.m. on 5 June. While Vincent was the senior officer present, the troops were placed under the conduct and direction of Lieutenant Colonel Harvey, who led them silently toward Stoney Creek. They had removed the flints from their muskets to ensure that there were no accidental discharges and dared not utter even a whisper. A sentry post of American soldiers was surprised and either captured or killed by bayonet.Letter, Lt. James FitzGibbon to Rev. James Somerville – 7 June 1813, Cruikshank, p. 12. Billy Green is said to have bayoneted one of the American sentries personally, although this is not mentioned in any official British record. The British continued advancing toward the American campfires in silence. However at the repeated urging of Second Lieutenant Ephraim Shaler, the U.S. 25th Regiment which had earlier been camped there had been moved from their previous exposed position, leaving behind only the cooks who were preparing the troops' meal for the next day.Elliot, p. 119. Shaler had returned to the original position when he heard a sentry cry out as he was being tomahawked after being shot with an arrow from one of John Norton's small band of First Nations warriors. Around the same time, a group of Vincent's staff officers who had come forward to watch the action let out a cheer. Their men took up the cheer, relieving their tension but depriving them of the element of surprise that was their primary advantage given the lopsided number of troops they faced. Instead of striking fear in their adversaries, the yells served to direct their attention to where the British were, helping the rousing troops to focus their attention and musket fire and making it nearly impossible for officers' orders to be heard above the din. Any hope of catching the Americans unaware and bayoneting them in their sleep was now lost and the British fixed their flints to their muskets and attacked. Lieutenant James Fitzgibbon and three sergeants of the Light Company of the 49th were able to keep their men from taking up the shout \\"until a late stage of the affair, when firing on our side became general\\".Stanley, p. 18. Gradually, the American troops began to recover from the initial surprise, recover their poise and start firing at the attacking British, at times from as far away as . The American artillery also entered the fray after having previously been rendered useless due to the dampness settling into the powder.Elliot, p. 123. Holding the high ground, the Americans were able to pour both musket and artillery fire into the exposed British line and the line began to lose cohesion. For ammunition, the U.S. Twenty-Fifth Infantry was firing a variant of 'buck and ball', in this instance firing 12 buckshot balls instead of the usual .65 calibre ball and 3 buckshot. This effectively turned their muskets into shotguns.Elliot, p. 121. Despite repeated charges by the British, the centre of the American line was holding and with the withering fire that the British line was sustaining, it was only a matter of time before they would have to retire. William Winder ordered the U.S. 5th Infantry to protect the left flank, unintentionally creating a gap in the American lines. A series of events coincided to change the course of the battle. General Winder ordered the U.S. 5th Infantry to protect the left flank. In doing so, he created a gap in the American line while at the same time leaving the artillery unsupported by infantry. Simultaneously, the other American commander, John Chandler, hearing musket shots from the far right of the American line and having already sent his staff officers off with other orders, rode out to investigate personally. But his horse fell (or was shot – Chandler used both excuses at different times) and he was knocked out in the fall.Elliot, p. 134. Major Charles Plenderleath, commanding the British 49th Regiment, was able to ascertain the position of the American artillery when two field guns fired in quick succession (). Realising the importance of possession of the guns, he gathered troops of Fitzgibbon's and other nearby companies to charge the guns before they could reload. First to volunteer for what could be a suicidal attack were 23-year- old Sergeant Alexander Fraser and his 21-year-old brother Peter, a corporal in Fitzgibbon's company,Elliot, p. 136. with 20 to 30 others. With bayonets fixed, Plenderleath led the charge up Gage's Lane, volunteers following at a run, all fearing that the next discharge from the cannons might annihilate them. However, the U.S. 2nd Artillery under the command of Captain Nathaniel Towson at that moment responded to an order to cease firing, unaware of the British troops advancing on their position. The gunners were without arms of their own. The British charged the field guns, and when they were within a few yards of the gun emplacement, the men began yelling \\"Come on, Brant\\". They set upon the helpless gunners, bayoneting man and horse, quickly overrunning and capturing the positionHitsman, p. 150. before continuing on to engage the U.S. 23rd Infantry which got off one round before the momentum of the 49th scattered them.Elliot, p. 137. The remaining British forces followed soon after.Letter, Brigadier General Vincent to Sir George Prevost – 6 June 1813, Cruikshank, p. 8. American Gen John Chandler was captured near the end of the battle. At this point General Chandler, conscious again and aware of the commotion near his artillery but not of the reason, stumbled to the position to investigate. Thinking himself to be among the U.S. 23rd Infantry and intending to bring order back to the \\"new and undisciplined\\" troops,Niles' Weekly Register – 19 October 1816, Battle of Stoney Creek. he realised to his horror that the soldiers were British and Alexander Fraser immediately took him prisoner at bayonet point. Winder very shortly thereafter fell prey to the same mistake. Realising his error, he pulled his pistol, aiming it at Fraser who was poised to take him prisoner as he had Chandler. With his musket pointed at Winder's breast, Fraser told him menacingly \\"If you stir, sir; you die\\"Elliot, p. 138. and Winder was made prisoner also, proffering his sword to Fraser.Letter, Brigadier General Chandler to General Dearborn – 18 June 1813, Cruikshank, p. 25. Major Joseph Lee Smith of the 25th U.S. Infantry was very nearly captured himself but having made good his escape, alerted his men to make a quick withdrawal, thereby avoiding capture.Cruikshank, p. 23. Command of the American forces fell to cavalry officer Colonel James Burn. The cavalry charged forward firing, but once again in the darkness, the Americans suffered from a case of mistaken identity – they were firing on their own U.S. 16th Infantry, who were themselves wandering around without their commander and firing at each other in confusion. Shortly afterwards, the Americans fell back, convinced that they had been defeated, when in fact they still retained a superior force.Berton, p. 78. The battle lasted less than 45 minutes, but its intensity led to heavy casualties on both sides. As dawn broke, Harvey ordered the outnumbered British to fall back into the woods in order to hide their small numbers. They succeeded in carrying away two of the captured guns, and spiked two more, leaving them on the ground owing to their inability to move them. They later watched from a distance as the Americans returned to their camp after daybreak, burned their provisions and tents and retreated toward Forty Mile Creek (present day Grimsby, Ontario). By afternoon on 6 June, the British occupied the former site of the American camp. For much of the morning of 6 June, General Vincent was missing. He had been injured after a fall from his horse during the battle and was found wandering in a state of confusion, convinced that the entire British force had been destroyed. He was finally located about seven miles from the battle scene; his horse, hat and sword all missing.Berton, p. 79. Casualties The British casualty return gave 23 killed, 136 wounded and 55 missing. Of the men reported as \\"missing\\", 52 were captured by the Americans. The American casualty return for 6 June gave 17 killed, 38 wounded and 7 officers (2 brigadier-generals, 1 major, 3 captains and 1 lieutenant) and 93 enlisted men missing. The British report of prisoners taken on the morning of 6 June corresponds exactly to the American list of \\"missing\\" as concerns the number and ranks of the captured officers but gives 94 enlisted men captured, indicating that one of the Americans who was presumed to have been killed in the casualty return was in fact captured. Of the seven officers who were captured on the morning of 6 June, three (Gen. Chandler, Captain Peter Mills and Captain George Steele) were wounded,Heitman, Volume 2, pp. 17, 31 and 37. which suggests that a substantial number of the enlisted prisoners may also have been wounded. British killed in action at the Battle of Stoney Creek, 6 June 1813 (as listed on the Stoney Creek Battlefield Monument): Samuel Hooker, Joseph Hunt, James Daig, Thomas Fearnsides, Richard Hugill, George Longley, Laurence Mead, John Regler, John Wale, Charles Page, James Adams, Alexander Brown, Michael Burke, Henry Carroll, Nathaniel Catlin, Martin Curley, Martin Donnolly, Peter Henley, John Hostler, Edward Killoran, Edward Little, Patrick Martin, John Maxwell. The names of the American dead are not recorded. Aftermath Morgan Lewis proceeded towards Stoney Creek in an attempt to displace the British. Casualties in the fight had been uneven, with the British taking roughly three times more killed and wounded than the Americans, but the Americans had been shaken. It is most probable that if their generals had not been captured, the battle might have turned out quite differently. However, the British had a reasonable claim to victory in this battle. Under the de facto leadership of Colonel Harvey, and with some good fortune, they had successfully forced the Americans back toward the Niagara River. American forces would never again advance so far from the Niagara. At Forty Mile Creek, the retreating American troops were met by reinforcements under Dearborn's second-in-command, Major General Morgan Lewis. Dearborn had ordered Lewis to proceed to Stoney Creek to attack the British, but almost as the two groups met, the British fleet under Captain Sir James Lucas Yeo appeared in Lake Ontario. The American armed vessels under Commodore Isaac Chauncey had abruptly vanished when they heard that Yeo and troops under Lieutenant General Sir George Prevost had attacked their own base at Sackett's Harbor, New York. (The Battle of Sackett's Harbor was a defeat for the British, but large quantities of stores and equipment had mistakenly been set on fire by the Americans, hampering the Americans' efforts to build large fighting vessels.) With Yeo threatening his communications, which ran for along the edge of the lake, Lewis decided to retreat at once to Fort George, leaving a large quantity of tents, arms and supplies for the British to acquire. The British vigorously followed up the American withdrawal. A skirmish on 7 June brought in 12 more prisoners; a captain and 11 enlisted men. During 8–10 June 80 more prisoners were taken,Cruikshank, p. 64. making a total American loss, during 6–10 June, of 16 killed, 38 wounded and 192 captured: total 230 men. The Americans retired into a small defensive perimeter around Fort George, where they remained until abandoning the fort and retreating across the Niagara River into U.S. territory in December.Berton, pp. 79–80. Brigadier General Winder was later exchanged and subsequently commanded the Tenth Military District around Washington, where he attracted censure following the burning of Washington. Legacy The Battlefield Monument at Battlefield Park commemorates the Battle of Stoney Creek. Battlefield House remains from the time of the battle, and is a museum located within Battlefield Park. They are located very near the site of the battle and, with a knoll across the street where a separate monument stands, comprises Battle of Stoney Creek National Historic Site. The park's stone tower, was dedicated exactly 100 years after the battle. It was unveiled following a signal given by Queen Mary in England, via the transatlantic telegraph cable, and commemorates British soldiers who died in the fight. The Gage farm house is also preserved and serves as a museum. The battle is re- enacted annually on the weekend closest to 6 June. The 2016 event was the 35th such re-enactment. The battle is commemorated in the song \\"Billy Green\\" from the 1999 album From Coffee House to Concert Hall by the late Canadian folk singer Stan Rogers. George Fox also sang \\"Billy Green\\" which is on his album, Canadian. References Referenced in notes   General * John R.

It begins in Ottawa in the Riverview neighbourhood and runs eastward through the rural communities of Ramsayville, Carlsbad Springs and Bearbrook in Ottawa and through the Municipality of Clarence-Rockland, connecting the communities of Cheney and Bourget, ending at Boundary Road on the eastern border of Clarence Rockland. In Ottawa it is officially Ottawa Road #26, and in Clarence-Rockland as United Counties of Prescott and Russell County Road #2.Ontario Back Road Atlas, 2011 Edition, MapArt Publishing Corp, pgs 66-67 History The road was originally built in the 1830s from parts of an indigenous trail that led to led to Montreal.https://ottawarewind.com/2020/04/26/in-search-of-the-lost- spring-of-carlsbad-springs/ In the 19th century, it was also known as the \\"Ottawa and Russell macadamized road\\". and was owned by the \\"Ottawa and Russell Macadamized Road Company\\". It would later be owned by the \\"Ottawa, Montreal & Russell Road Company\\". The Carleton County 1879 Atlas shows the road running from the Village of Janeville (now Vanier)Illustrated Historical Atlas of the County of Carleton, 1879, pg 46, southward following the east bank of the Rideau River toward Hurdman's Bridge, then eastward following what is now Terminal Avenue, then turning south to connect more or less to its current alignment.Illustrated Historical Atlas of the County of Carleton, 1879, pg 46 In about 1952, following the area's annexation into Ottawa, Russell Road from Janeville (at this time called Eastview) to Hurdman's Bridge would be renamed Riverside Drive (now River Road North). In 1960, the part of Russell Road from Hurdman's Bridge to the \\"westerly limit of the NCC subdivision\\" was renamed \\"Terminal Avenue\\". By the 1960s, the city of Ottawa deemed Russell Road as a \\"public highway\\", and plans were put in place to truncate the road to alleviate traffic. A by-law was passed in 1961 promising to close the road north of Industrial Avenue as soon as Industrial was extended to St. Laurent Boulevard. It was first truncated at Belfast Road in 1965, and then in 1979, it was temporarily truncated at Industrial, despite protestations from residents who used the road as a shortcut. This section was finally closed in 1980. The intersection of Russell Road with Smyth Road and St. Laurent Boulevard was realigned in 1976. Further east, following the completion of Highway 417 through Ramsayville in the mid-1970s, Russell Road was bifurcated by the highway. The bifurcation meant that Russell Road would be diverted to end at Baseline Road (now Ramsayville Road), south of the highway, and begin again north of the highway, with a bridge taking traffic under the new highway. Russell Road faced its final realignment in the mid-1990s when Hawthorne Road was extended north to the intersection of Russell and Walkley Road. The part of Russell Road south of Walkely was thus diverted to a new intersection with Hawthorne. These intersection modifications have cut the road into 4 parts. To sum, Russell Road now begins at Industrial Avenue on the outskirts of the Riverview neighbourhood and runs southeast before ending at Smyth Road. The road begins again near the Elmvale Shopping Centre, from St. Laurent Boulevard, and runs south until it turns into Hawthorne Road. To keep going on Russell, one must make a left turn. This part of Russell Road continues to the community of Ramsayville, where the road then ends at Ramsayville Road. To keep going on Russell Road, one must take a left on Ramsayville Road, cross Highway 417 then turn right. At this point Russell Road continues east through the communities of Carlsbad Springs, Bearbrook before leaving the city of Ottawa. It then passes through the communities of Cheney and Bourget in the City of Clarence-Rockland. Russell Road was named because it was used by travellers, before the construction of Highway 417 as the route to get to Russell, Ontario from both Ottawa in the west and Bourget in the east. Russell Road for the majority of its length passes through rural surroundings. Russell, Ontario is named after Peter Russell, a government official and slave trader in Upper Canada.Nothing But Names: An Inquiry Into the Origin of the Names of the Counties and Townships of Ontario, pgs 49 & 50 Route description The segment of Russell Road from Industrial to Smyth is a 1.3km two-lane collector street that cuts through the eastern edge of the Riverview neighbourhood. Addresses on this segment begin at 1636 Russell in the north and 1929 in the south. Generally, the west side of the street is home to post-World War II housing, while the east side is commercial, though there are homes on the east side closer to Smyth.geoOttawa Among this section's amenities are the Perley and Rideau Veteran's Health Centre (1720-1780), Russell Heights Ottawa Community Housing public housing (1761-1803), Russell Smyth Heights apartments (1825), Russell Manor Ottawa Community Housing (1909) and Smyth Medical Centre (1929). Russell Road between Walkley and Hawthorne. The second segment of Russell Road begins about 370m southeast of terminus of the first segment. In this gap, there remains one building with a Russell address at 1990, a strip mall at the corner of Smyth and St. Laurent. The second segment of Russell does not begin until further southeast, at an intersection with St. Laurent Boulevard where St. Laurent turns into Russell, while St. Laurent begins a new segment at the intersection. It ends at a similar intersection with Hawthorne Road, where the road continues southward on Hawthorne, and a new segment of Russell begins. This segment is about 1.8km long, and separates the neighbourhoods of Hawthorne Meadows on the west and Sheffield Glen on the east. The segments addresses begin at 2080 and end at 2400. 2080 Russell is another public housing project known as Russell Gardens.http://www.och- lco.ca/properties/russell-gardens/ Other amenities in this segment include Hawthorne United Church (2244) and a fourth public housing project, Confederation Court (2282).http://www.och-lco.ca/properties/confederation- court/ Between St. Laurent and Walkley, Russell is mostly a two lane road. In addition to the housing projects, there are also ordinary dwellings on the west side of the street built around 1970. The short segment between Walkley and Hawthorne is a 4-lane divided arterial road. The third segment of Russell begins at Hawthorne and ends at Ramsayville Road, and runs for 3.7km. It is mostly rural in character, beginning at the suburban edge of the city, and heads southeast into the countryside. Addresses for this segment begin at 2434 and end at 4397. Amenities include the William E. Hay Centre, a youth detention centrehttps://easternontario.cioc.ca/record/OCR0497 (2464), St. George's Hawthorne Cemetery (3970) and Ramsayville Cemetry. Russell is two- lane arterial road in this segment. While mostly rural, there are a few industrial establishments north of Hunt Club. The fourth segment of Russell begins 730m north of where the third segment ended on Ramsayville Road in the community of Ramsayville. This section is signed as Ottawa Road #26. Addresses on this segment begin at 4610. The road runs for 5kn eastward before merging with Leitrim Road. The road then runs another 1.5km before splitting from Leitrim again at the northern edge of the community of Carlsbad Springs. Close to the bridge over Bear Brook, there is an historical plaque on the side of Russell detailing the history of the community.http://ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_Ottawa10.html From Leitrim Rd, it's 2.9km to the centre of Carlsbad Springs at Boundary Road. Russell Road then travels 10.3km eastward until the community of Bearbrook at the intersection with Dunning Road. Bearbrook is home to the Bearbrook Community Hall at 8720 Russell and the Trinity Anglican Church Bearbrook (8785). From Bearbrook, the road travels 5.4km eastward until the Ottawa city limits at Canaan Road, where it enters the city of Clarence-Rockland as Country Road 2. The last address on Russell in the city of Ottawa is 9999. Upon entering Clarence-Rockland, addresses re-start at 102. 2.2km east of the border is the community of Cheney, where Russell intersects with Drouin Road. Russell Road then travels 5.9km to Marcil Road where it turns into Laval Street in Bourget. Along the way, it passes St. Francis Xavier Catholic High School at 1235 Russell. Russell Road begins again after 2.6km as Laval Street, when it intersections with Labelle Road/Schnupp Road. It then travels 4km east until the border with Alfred and Plantagenet when it becomes Boudreau Road.

The band currently consists of Luke Jenner (lead vocals, guitar), Vito Roccoforte (drums, percussion), and Gabriel Andruzzi (keyboards, bass, saxophone, percussion). The classic lineup (1999-2009) added Mattie Safer playing bass and sharing lead vocal duties with Jenner. Safer and Jenner's harmonized choruses became part of the signature sound of the band, featuring on several of the band’s more well known songs. The band mix influences from many genres including dance-punk, post-punk, acid house, disco, and electronica. They were forerunners of the post-punk revival during the early 2000s, as they mixed their early post-punk sound with electronic and dance elements. The band began by releasing a mini-album, Mirror, in January 1999, under Gravity Records. Afterward, in 2001, the band signed to Sub Pop and released the EP Out of the Races and Onto the Tracks. The band released the song \\"House of Jealous Lovers\\" in 2002 under their new record label DFA Records. After a re-release of the song, it peaked at number 27 on the UK Singles Chart in 2003 and received critical acclaim. Later that year, the band released their first full-length studio album, Echoes. The band released their second studio album, Pieces of the People We Love, in 2006 under Universal Records and Vertigo Records, featuring production from Danger Mouse, Paul Epworth, and Ewan Pearson. The band entered a small hiatus in 2008 after band member Luke Jenner left the band, but he eventually returned to the band after 8 months. Mattie Safer, the band's long time bassist and vocalist, also left the band permanently in 2009. After a re-signing to DFA Records, the band released their third studio album, In the Grace of Your Love, in September 2011, which was their first studio album in five years. In 2014, it was revealed that the Rapture had disbanded, though no official statement had been made. The band later reunited in 2019 without Safer. History Formation, Mirror and Out of the Races and Onto the Tracks (1998–2002) In 1998, drummer Vito Roccoforte and guitarist/vocalist Luke Jenner formed the Rapture. They were childhood friends from a San Diego suburb who started playing music together, and when Roccoforte moved to San Francisco for college, Jenner followed him and they started playing more, which would lead to forming the Rapture. Roccoforte was an aspiring filmmaker, but became a drummer at Jenner's insistence. According to Jenner in 2018, \\"In college, he got really good grades and had all of these ambitions to be a filmmaker. I kind of railroaded him into the Rapture. He didn’t really want to be a drummer, but I needed somebody I could trust who was never going to leave my side. And he agreed; it’s not like I forced him into it. I asked him humbly and he accepted.\\" They released a single, \\"The Chair That Squeaks\\", on Hymnal Sound that same year. After heavy touring, they released a debut mini-album, Mirror, on Gravity Records in 1999. After having his house burned down by drug dealers, their bass player suggested they move to Seattle because he had better music contacts there. In five months between January and May '99, the band spent more time getting drunk than writing songs, but they did manage to get a record deal from Sub Pop. After releasing Mirror, they decided it would be best to move to New York, where they slept in a van that they had bought with money from the label. It was in New York that bassist and vocalist Mattie Safer, a freshman studying jazz at NYU joined the band. He had met them the previous summer when they were touring through Washington DC. He joined the band in the fall of 1999, prior to the 2001 release of the six-song EP Out of the Races and Onto the Tracks on Sub Pop. The addition of Safer proved to pivotal for the band, according to Jenner. In 2006 he said, \\"There were five people in the band before Matt in the space of just over a year. He was the first person that was actually good. He was musically way better than us and brought a lot of stability. Listening to him for the first time made me think that I actually had better learn to play my own instrument.\\" Living in New York also made Jenner aware of the possibilities offered by dance music. In 2011 he said, \\"Coming to NY and going to proper dance music clubs, that was pivotal. I was hearing dance music over a big system and realizing it has the same energy as a hardcore show, the idea that a kick drum can be so powerful, so tough-sounding in a song like 'Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough' by Michael Jackson on the right system. I think also, just the raw power of dancing, and the kind of communal aspect that could be created, like the same thing that sprouts up around punk rock kids, it could be the same with dance music.\\" \\"House of Jealous Lovers\\" and Echoes (2002–06) With the help of the DFA production team, the band released \\"House of Jealous Lovers\\" in 2002 and eventually released their first full-length album Echoes. The album secured two Top 40 singles in the UK and also was met with critical acclaim, being awarded Album of the Year by pitchforkmedia.com and runner up in NME only to the White Stripes. Multi-instrumentalist Gabriel Andruzzi, who is also Safer's cousin, joined the band full-time after the record was completed to help tour. In the wake of the success of \\"House of Jealous Lovers\\", The Rapture opened for the Sex Pistols in a football stadium in England, and underwent a large major bidding war eventually signing with Vertigo Records out of the UK and Strummer Records (a Gary Gersh Label) both owned by Universal Music. In January 2004, the Rapture toured with Franz Ferdinand on the NME Awards Tour. Later that year, the band toured on the main stage of the Curiosa Festival alongside Interpol, Mogwai, and The Cure. The album's main song, \\"Echoes\\", was used as opening for the British series Misfits. Pieces of the People We Love (2006–11) The Rapture performing live in 2006 The Rapture released their second full-length album, Pieces of the People We Love, on Universal Motown Records in September 2006 after Strummer folded. Paul Epworth, Ewan Pearson and Danger Mouse produced the album. Recorded mostly in New York city at Sear Sound (studio of Walter Sear, partner of Bob Moog) but also recorded a few songs in Los Angeles to work with Danger Mouse. The bulk of the recording being handled by Epworth and Pearson. The title track features Cee Lo Green on backing vocals. The Rapture also toured with Daft Punk on the North American leg of their tour in 2007, playing such venues as Red Rocks in Colorado, and the Greek Theatre in Berkeley California. In an interview with Dave Owen of Access All Areas and I Can't Breathe Media, Luke Jenner stated that Justin Timberlake originally sang on the track \\"No Sex For Ben\\" that the band recorded for 2008's Grand Theft Auto IV video game soundtrack: \\"We were recording with Timbaland, 'cause he beatboxes on the track and Justin was upstairs with Duran Duran and he came down and sang [backing vocals] on the track [with Safer on lead vocals], but when we got it back from the label someone had removed JT's vocals.\\" The song was a hit, with Jenner stating in 2011, \\"That song kept us alive for five years. In the interim we played Australia once a year for five years because that song was a big hit there. Ordinary people know it. Australia is where I lived out all my 14 year-old rock star dreams.\\" In contrast, Vito Roccoforte stated his dissatisfaction with the song by saying, \\"It just didn’t make any fucking sense to me because it was the total antithesis of what I felt musically I wanted to do or what we should be doing.\\" In 2008, Luke Jenner left the band in the wake of his mother's death and son's birth. After a few months he returned to the band. On July 14, 2009, Gabriel Andruzzi announced via The Rapture's official website that Mattie Safer had left the band in April and added that the remaining members had been working on new material since Safer's departure in their Brooklyn studio. In the days following Safer's departure Dave Owen caught up with Luke Jenner who said that the split was amicable. After leaving The Rapture, Mattie Safer spent a year and a half working on new music, then sending it out to various friends including Paul Epworth, who encouraged Safer to \\"stop worrying about trying to be cool.\\" Expressing interest in Safer's R&B-influenced; music, in 2011 Epworth signed him to the new label he was starting, Wolf Tone. Though Safer managed to record an EP, ultimately he and Wolf Tone decided to part ways, and in 2016 he finally released the EP All We Are. In 2011, Safer also appeared as a guest vocalist on \\"Someone Just Like You\\" from House of Beni, the debut album by Australian producer Beni. In August 2011, The Rapture first appeared on the cover of the publication The FADER, in its 75th issue. In the Grace of Your Love and split (2011–14) The Rapture released In The Grace of Your Love on DFA Records on September 6, 2011, in the U.S. and September 5 in Europe while Modular released the album in Australia and New Zealand. Phoenix producer/Cassius member Philippe Zdar produced the record, which the Rapture recorded in Brooklyn and Paris. In 2014, Red Bull Music Academy announced Atomic Bomb! The Music of William Onyeabor, a concert in tribute to William Onyeabor led by David Byrne and featuring Jenner as one of the prominent musicians involved. In the press release, Jenner was listed as \\"ex-The Rapture.\\" Jonathan Galkin, manager of DFA Records, seemingly confirmed that the band had indeed broken up by saying, \\"I kept thinking it might blow over, but that might not be the case. Feel free to go to press with this headline: 'Did the Rapture Break Up and Not Tell Anyone?'\\" In late 2014, Jenner asserted that while the band had never released an official statement about breaking up and that Galkin's comments being picked up by the media had led to that assumption, there were issues that needed to be resolved before they could make new music again. He said, \\"A band is a relationship — it’s a marriage or a close relationship. For me, my relationships with the band is more important than the band. If my relationship with Vito isn’t straight then there’s no point in trying to write and make music together. I can make music on my own, I don’t need to deal with Vito. But if we’re going to make music we’re going to have to talk about some stuff, and that has to come first.\\" After the band announced its reunion in 2019, Andruzzi provided some insight regarding the atmosphere during their last tour prior to their split: Post-split activity (2014–18) In June 2014, Vito Roccoforte and Gabriel Andruzzi released Moon Temple, their debut EP as Vito & Druzzi. Moon Temple would also become the name of Andruzzi's solo project, which released the two EPs Moon Temple I and Moon Temple II in 2016. Andruzzi and Roccoforte have also collaborated as Mother of Mars, releasing the single \\"Seed 2 Sky\\" in 2018. Besides participating in Atomic Bomb! The Music of William Onyeabor, Luke Jenner learned production from Joakim Bouaziz, and was a guest vocalist on the latter's track \\"Bring Your Love\\" from the 2014 album Tropics of Love. In 2015, Roccoforte formed Body Music, a duo with DJ and producer Benjamin \\"Bosq\\" Woods of Whiskey Barons. They released their debut EP Just One in 2017. In 2017, Jenner reiterated that he was still a member of The Rapture, and that whether or not the band would continue was up to Roccaforte. \\"I would love to do the Rapture again, at this point it’s just up to Vito. He lives like a block away from here,\\" he said. \\"I still consider myself in the band. I have songs where I’m like, 'This is a Rapture song.' I could make it for myself, but also it’s a Rapture song. My voice is so specific, it’s really easily identifiable. I’m sorta waiting on a phone call from Vito, saying, 'Okay I’m ready to do stuff.'\\" That same year, Jenner released the Sunrise EP as Meditation Tunnel, The name Meditation Tunnel comes from a children's toy and was chosen by Jenner for his solo project because Manfredi Romano a.k.a. DJ Tennis, who released the EP, forbade him to use his own name. In 2018, Jenner started the band Seedy Films with three friends whose taste he admired but had never played music before. Explaining the idea behind the band, Jenner said, \\"I really relate to how Brian Eno was more of a thinker than a musician. I mean, he makes some amazing music, but he has really great ideas. I have this idea that you can teach people techniques, but you can’t teach them taste. I’ve been in so many bands that had questionable taste and it always ends badly. Because saying you don’t like someone’s taste is like saying you don’t like someone’s face. You can’t change your taste, really; you can hone it, but you like what you like. So I had these three people I was already friends with who had really great taste, and I asked them if they wanted to play music. So I started teaching them and we put together this band. Writing songs is the easy part for me, so I taught them how to write songs and I play drums in the band because… why not? I’ve already done everything else. So that’s really fun. In early 2018, Gabriel Andruzzi said, \\"I’ve talked to Luke recently, but there is nothing specific in the works. Thus I cannot report anything one way or another regarding The Rapture. I remain optimistic, and I must say that I always love playing shows with that band.\\" Roccoforte also started playing shows with Wah Together, a new rock band which also consists of guitarist Steve Schiltz (Longwave, bassist Phil Mossman LCD Soundsystem and vocalist Jaiko Suzuki. On 5 September 2018, Annie Nightingale debuted some of their songs on her BBC Radio 1 show. Roccoforte and Safer also reunited as the rhythm section for the new live format of Poolside. Poolside co-founder Jeffrey Paradise said in a statement, \\"Vito and Mattie are the backbone and rhythm section from one of my favorite bands ever: The Rapture. They’ve been big influences on my musical career over the years. It’s super inspiring to play together with such great people with amazing musical chemistry. The punch they add to the music is unmistakable.” Reunion (2019–present) In February 2019, Jenner announced via Facebook that The Rapture would be reuniting. The band's first show back is to be at the Music Hall of Williamsburg on April 30, followed by an appearance at the Just Like Heaven festival in Long Beach on May 4 alongside Phoenix, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and MGMT. In a statement, Jenner explained the group's reunion after over five years: Both Roccoforte and Andruzzi confirmed their participation in the reunion via social media, as did Harris Klahr who would be resuming bass-playing duties for the band's live shows that he had assumed after Safer's departure. In response to a question on Twitter, Safer confirmed that he was not participating in the reunion. In a subsequent Instagram post, Safer stated that he \\"would love the opportunity to get up and play those songs again, but I wasn't asked,\\" but that he was \\"super psyched on [his] new band Safer, new label Cell Laboratories and playing Poolside.\\" In popular culture * \\"Out of the Races and Onto the Tracks\\" featured in the film adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis novel The Rules Of Attraction. * \\"Echoes\\" plays in a scene of the film Superbad and is the opening theme for the E4 television series Misfits. * \\"The Devil\\" plays in a scene during the episode \\"Rocket Club\\" in the television series Aliens in America. * “Killing” was featured in the 2005 video game True Crime: New York City. * \\"Whoo!

The character has been owned by the estate of its creator, writer-artist Pete Morisi, since his death in 2003. Publication history Charlton Comics The character debuted in Peter Cannon ... Thunderbolt #1 (Jan. 1966), part of Charlton editor Dick Giordano's \\"Action Heroes\\" superhero line. The series then took over the numbering of the defunct title Son of Vulcan, and ran from issue #51–60 (March/April 1966 – November 1967), after which Morisi, a New York City Police Department officer and time- pressed with police work, left the title, which was canceled along with the rest of Charlton's \\"Action Heroes\\" comics line. There were several backup series in Thunderbolt. \\"The Sentinels\\", by Gary Friedrich (writing his first superhero stories) and penciler-inker Sam Grainger, appeared in #54–59, and #60 had the Prankster, written by Dennis O'Neil with art by Jim Aparo. Morisi, who'd done work for Lev Gleason Publications in 1940s, reported in Comic Book Artist #9 (August 2000) that he had attempted to buy the rights to 1940s superhero Daredevil in the early 1960s. Gleason gave him his okay, but the character's primary writer-artist, Charles Biro, balked, requesting a percentage of future profits. Morisi declined and went on to create Thunderbolt in a scaled-down version of that Daredevil's symmetrically divided, red-and-blue costume. Mike Collins and Jose Marzan Jr. DC Comics After Charlton sold its superhero properties to DC in 1983, Thunderbolt reappeared after almost two decades in the Crisis on Infinite Earths crossover series (April 1985 – March 1986, Thunderbolt appearing in #6, 7, and 10) when he joined the heroes of the Multiverse in their crusade against the Anti-Monitor. Introducing him into the new DC Universe, DC published Peter Cannon – Thunderbolt, by writer-penciler Mike Collins and inker Jose Marzan Jr. The series ran for 12 issues before cancellation (September 1992 – August 1993). During the series' short run, his recurring foils were the criminal terrorists-for-hire known as Scorpio. He later discovers that his girlfriend Cairo DeFrey was actually in charge of the organization. The character also appeared briefly with the Justice League. Dynamite Entertainment Dynamite Entertainment published a ten issue series between September 2012 and July 2013. The series was co-written by Steve Darnall and Alex Ross, with art by Jonathan Lau. The character later appeared in a new series published since February 2019. The series is written by Kieron Gillen with art by Caspar Wijngaard, Mary Jo Safro and Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou and. In this series, it is revealed that Peter Cannon and Tabu were lovers. Fictional character biography His origin, as detailed in the original comic: > \\"Peter Cannon, orphaned son of an American medical team, was raised in a > Himalayan lamasery, where his parents had sacrificed their lives combating > the dreaded Black Plague! After attaining the highest degree of mental and > physical perfection, he was entrusted with the knowledge of the ancient > scrolls that bore the secret writings of past generations of wise men! From > them he learned concentration, mind over matter, the art of activating and > the harnessing the unused portions of the brain, that made seemingly > fantastic feats possible! Then he returned to America with his faithful > friend, Tabu, and sought out a new life, in a new land, that required the > emergence of Peter Cannon... Thunderbolt\\". His costume is his training outfit from the lamasery, with an added mask. A recurring villain is the \\"Hooded One\\", another monk from the lamasery who resented the fact an outsider like Peter was given access to the sacred scrolls.

After having committed several felonies including armed robbery, he was arrested for three rapes on the campus of Ohio State University. In the course of preparing his defense, psychologists diagnosed Milligan with multiple personality disorder. His lawyers plead insanity, claiming that two of his alternate personalities committed the crimes without Milligan being aware of it. He was the first person diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder to raise such a defense, and the first acquitted of a major crime for this reason, instead spending a decade in mental hospitals. Milligan's life story was popularized by Daniel Keyes's award-winning non-fiction novel The Minds of Billy Milligan. Biography Childhood Milligan was born in February 1955, in Miami Beach, to Dorothy Milligan and Johnny Morrison. Dorothy Milligan grew up in Ohio farm country and lived in Lancaster with her previous husband. They divorced, and Dorothy eventually moved to the Miami area, where she worked as a singer. There she began living with Johnny Morrison. Dorothy and Morrison had two other children: a son, Jim Milligan, in October 1953, and a daughter, Kathy Jo Milligan, born in December 1956. Morrison struggled with fatherhood, and according to Daniel Keyes, \\"Meeting the medical expenses overwhelmed Johnny. He borrowed more, gambled more, drank more [...]. [He] was hospitalized for acute alcoholism and depression in [...] 1958.\\" In what appeared to be a suicide attempt, according to Keyes, \\"[Dorothy] found him slumped over the table, half a bottle of Scotch and an empty bottle of sleeping pills on the floor.\\" A few months after this attempt, on January 17, 1959, Johnny committed suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning.Keyes, Daniel (1981). The Minds of Billy Milligan, Random House, p. 131-135. Dorothy took her children and moved away from Miami, eventually returning to Lancaster, Ohio, where she remarried her ex-husband. This marriage lasted about a year. In 1962, she met Chalmer Milligan (1927–1988).Ohio Death Index: \\"Chalmer J Milligan b est 1927, resident of Lancaster, Fairfield County, Ohio, died 14 Dec 1988 in Fairfield County\\" Chalmer's first wife Bernice divorced him on \\"grounds of gross neglect\\".Lancaster Eagle Gazette, June 21, 1962. Article states, \\"[...] they wed July 23, 1957.\\" He had a daughter, Challa, the same age as Billy, and another daughter who was a nurse. Dorothy and Chalmer married in Circleville, Ohio, on October 27, 1963.Keyes, p. 135-139 At his later trial, Chalmer was blamed for abusing Billy. Keyes claimed that Billy had multiple personalities from a much earlier age, however, with his first three (no-name boy, Christene, and Shawn) appearing by the time he was five years old. Arrest In 1975, Milligan was imprisoned at Lebanon Correctional Institution in Ohio for rape and armed robbery. He was released on parole in early 1977 and was required to register as a sex offender. In October 1977, Milligan was arrested for raping three women on the Ohio State University campus. He was identified by one of his victims from existing police mug shots of sex offenders, and from fingerprints lifted from another victim's car. One of the victims said that he was quite nice and that he acted like a 3-year-old girl. Since he used a gun during the crime and guns were found in a search of his residence, he had violated his parole as well. He was indicted on \\"[...] three counts of kidnapping, three counts of aggravated robbery and four counts of rape\\". He then stayed in the Ohio State Penitentiary. In the course of preparing his defense, he underwent a psychological examination by Dr. Willis C. Driscoll, who diagnosed Milligan with acute schizophrenia. He was then examined by psychologist Dorothy Turner of Southwest Community Mental Health Center in Columbus, Ohio. During this examination, Turner concluded that Milligan suffered from dissociative identity disorder. Milligan's public defenders, Gary Schweickart and Judy Stevenson, pleaded an insanity defense, and he was committed \\"[...] until such time as he regains sanity\\". Incarceration Milligan was sent to a series of state-run mental hospitals, such as the Athens State Hospital, where, by his report, he received very little help. While he was in these hospitals, Milligan reported having ten different personalities. These ten were the only ones known to psychologists. Later on an additional 14 personalities, labeled \\"The Undesirables\\", were discovered. Among the first ten were Arthur, a prim and proper Englishman who was an expert in science, medicine and hematology; Allen, a manipulator; Tommy, an escape artist and technophile; Ragen Vadascovinich, a Yugoslav communist who Milligan claimed had committed the robberies in a kind of Robin Hood spirit; and Adalana, a 19-year-old lesbian who cooked for all the personalities and craved affection and who had allegedly committed the rapes.Keyes, p. 54 Milligan received treatment from psychiatrist David Caul, who diagnosed the additional fourteen personalities. Release Milligan was released in 1988 after a decade in mental hospitals, and discharged from the Ohio mental health system and the Ohio courts on August 1, 1991. In 1996 he lived in California where he owned Stormy Life Productions and was going to make a short film (which apparently has never been made). His location thereafter remained for a long time unknown, his former acquaintances having lost contact with him.\\"30 years later, multiple-personality case still fascinates\\", The Columbus Dispatch, 28 October 2007 Death Milligan died of cancer at a nursing home in Columbus, Ohio, on December 12, 2014. He was 59.Billy Milligan  1955-2014: Man with famous insanity plea dies, The Columbus Dispatch, retrieved December 17, 2014 Posterity Books Daniel Keyes authored a biographical non-fiction novel called The Minds of Billy Milligan (1981, available in fourteen, The Minds of Billy Milligan is available in at least in fourteen languages: Chinese, English, French, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Russian, Spanish. languages). His follow-up book, The Milligan Wars, was published in Japan in 1994, in Taiwan in 2000, in France in 2009, in Ukraine in 2018, but not yet in the United States, first owing to Milligan's ongoing lawsuit against the State of Ohio for the allegedly inadequate treatment he received in Ohio facilities, then to the desire to tie its release to an in-development film. Film Several attempts had been made by Hollywood to adapt Keyes' book. In the early 1990s, James Cameron co-wrote a screenplay with Todd Graff for a film version he was to direct then-titled A Crowded Room. This adaptation never came into fruition because Cameron was sued by adaptation rightsholder Sandy Arcara, demanding \\"her salary should be raised from $250,000 to $1.5 million\\";Brennan, David (2010). \\"A Crowded Room: The Abandoned Project\\" (Summary & Analysis of the Un- produced James Cameron Project, \\"A Crowded Room\\"), JamesCameronOnline.com seeing the project stalled, Milligan also sued Cameron in 1993. After Cameron left the project, Warner Bros. continued to develop it now slightly retitled The Crowded Room, with directors Joel Schumacher and David Fincher attached at various points. Actors courted for the role of Milligan included Matthew McConaughey, Johnny Depp, Brad Pitt, Sean Penn and John Cusack. , the film remains in limbo. In February 2015, it was confirmed that Leonardo DiCaprio would star as Milligan, with Jason Smilovic set to pen the script. Notes References * Keyes, Daniel (1981). The Minds of Billy Milligan.

It is the fourth game in the Street Fighter II sub-series of Street Fighter games, following Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting. In addition to refining and balancing the existing character roster from the previous versions, Super Street Fighter II introduced four new characters. It was also the first game to be developed on Capcoms CP System II hardware, which permitted more sophisticated graphics and audio over the original CP System hardware used in previous versions of Street Fighter II. Super Street Fighter II was followed by Super Street Fighter II Turbo, a fifth version of Street Fighter II released the following year, which further refined the balance between characters and introduced additional new features. Characters All twelve characters from the previous Street Fighter II games returned, with many having their basic and special techniques refined to adjust the overall balance. Some of the characters received new special techniques such as Ryu's Fire Hadōken (renamed Shakunetsu Hadōken in the Street Fighter Alpha series), a flaming Shoryuken for Ken, Zangief's Atomic Buster, and M. Bison's Devil Reverse. Four new characters were also introduced to the game in addition to the returning roster, expanding the number of playable characters to sixteen. The new characters are T. Hawk, an indigenous warrior from Mexico whose ancestral homeland was taken from him by Shadaloo; Fei Long, a Hong Kong movie star who wishes to test his martial arts against real opponents; Dee Jay, a kickboxing musician from Jamaica seeking inspiration for his next song; and Cammy, a 19-year-old female special forces agent from England with a mysterious past tied to M. Bison. Despite the addition of four new characters, the number of matches against the computer in the single-player mode remained unchanged at 12. Eight opponents are chosen at random, followed by the four Shadaloo Bosses (Balrog, Vega, Sagat, and M. Bison). Gameplay Super Street Fighter II featured the following changes from Street Fighter II Turbo: Hyper Fighting. Graphics and audio The HUD and all of the stages and character portraits featured new graphics. The original opening sequence and unused sequence, which had featured two generic characters fighting in front of a crowd, was replaced by a new opening featuring lead character Ryu launching a Hadouken projectile towards the screen. . The music and sound effects were also remade and a new announcer was introduced, who also recorded new voice samples for some of the characters (Ken, Guile, and Sagat). Other new features Cammy vs. Fei-Long in Ryu's stage. A new scoring system was implemented that keeps track of the number of hits a player performs during a combo. Super Street Fighter II features a new scoring system which kept track of combos, first attacks, reversals, and recoveries made by the player, and awarded the player with bonus points for performing such deeds. Players could choose one of eight color schemes for their character: the character's original color scheme, their color scheme from Champion Edition and Hyper Fighting, or one of five new color schemes. Exception: If the player chooses Balrog with the Hyper Fighting color scheme, he will instead appear with a darker skin tone and green boxing gloves. The faster game speed introduced in Hyper Fighting was reduced to the same speed level as Champion Edition. The faster game speed would later return in Super Turbo. Tournament Battle An alternate version of Super Street Fighter II features eight-player single- elimination tournament gameplay. Super Street Fighter II: The Tournament Battle requires four networked arcade cabinets. This edition of the game consists of three sets of four simultaneous matches: the initial eliminations, the semifinals, and the finals. After the first set is over, the players are re-arranged accordingly based on their success or failure: the winning players sent to either of the first two cabinets, whereas losing players sent to one of the remaining two. In the finals, the players competing for first place are sent to the first cabinet, the third-place players to the second cabinet, and so on. Ports Super NES The Super NES version of Super Street Fighter II, released on June 25, 1994 in Japan, and during the same month in North America and Europe, was the third Street Fighter game released for the console, following the original Street Fighter II and Street Fighter II Turbo (a port of Hyper Fighting). It was released on a 32 Megabit cartridge and featured support for the XBAND online network. The SNES port featured several new game modes such as Group Battle and Time Challenge, and the eight-player Tournament mode from the arcade version, in addition to the previous games' Arcade and Versus modes. Due to hardware limitations, certain music and sound effects were replaced with different renditions. Like in the SNES version of Turbo, the background music stops between rounds and restarts from the beginning at the next round. Unlike the Sega Genesis version, the SNES port has the blood for the character's beat up portraits removed or replaced with sweat (most likely due to Nintendo's strict censorship policy at the time). This version was re-released on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on November 8, 2011, the PAL region on April 12, 2012, and in North America on April 26, 2012. The Japanese version appeared on the Super Famicom Classic Edition, but was replaced by Street Fighter II Turbo in the SNES Classic Edition. Sega Mega Drive/Genesis The Sega Mega Drive/Genesis version was released simultaneously with its SNES counterpart in all three regions. Although there are differences between the SNES and Genesis ports, the two versions are almost identical in terms of content. Like the SNES version, the Genesis port supported the XBAND online network (although only for its North American release). The Sega Genesis version was released on a 40 Megabit cartridge, which allowed the inclusions of additional voice clips of the game's announcer which were missing from the SNES version, such as stating the names of the fighters, although the audio quality is not of the same level as the original arcade version. In the Options menu, the player can choose to play the Super Battle mode on \\"Normal\\" or \\"Expert\\" difficulty; the latter increases the number of opponents from the arcade version's 12 to all 16 characters. Several levels of speed could also be chosen. Sharp X68000 The X68000 version was released exclusively in Japan on September 30, 1994. The graphics are reproduced faithfully from the arcade version, with only a few omissions made (the message when a new challenger interrupts a match in 1-Player mode has differently-colored fonts, and the aurora in Cammy's stage is a different color as well). In terms of voices, all the spatial processing and echo processing specific to the CP System II hardware were removed. Like the X68000 version of Street Fighter II Dash, the game is compatible with multiple pulse- code modulation (PCM) drivers on a X68030 or higher models. A message from the game's sound team is hidden in one of the ADPCM sound files containing music. Like the previous X68000 port, it was sold with an adapter for the CPS Fighter joystick controller. Fujitsu FM Towns The FM Towns version was released exclusively in Japan on October 28, 1994. The player characters reproduced faithfully from the arcade version, but the backgrounds lack the original's parallax scrolling effect. The Q-Sound soundtrack of the arcade version is reproduced faithfully in this port, with an arranged version offered as an alternative (this version later featured in the 3DO port of Super Turbo and console versions of Hyper Street Fighter II). A color edit that allows players to alter each character's color scheme was added. Like the X68000 version, it also included an adapter for the CPS Fighter joystick controller. Other versions Super Street Fighter II was ported by Eurocom to IBM-PC compatibles (DOS CD-ROM) and Amiga in North America and Europe in 1995. Both ports were based on the SNES version. The game is also included in the original Street Fighter Collection for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn, released in 1997. However, this version lacks the 8-player tournament that appeared in the arcade and on other ports. A home arcade cabinet featuring Super Street Fighter II (as well as Turbo and Champion Edition) was released by the company Arcade1Up.https://www.destructoid.com/arcade1up-s-home-arcade- cabinets-look-fabulous-514332.phtml The game was included in the Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection for the Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Super Street Fighter II on their November 1, 1993 issue as being the most-successful table arcade unit of the year, outperforming titles like Fatal Fury Special and Samurai Shodown. In the February 1994 issue of Gamest, Super Street Fighter II was nominated for Best Game of 1993, ultimately ranked at third. In the category of Best Fighting Games, Super won three more third-place prizes in the categories of \\"Best Fighting Games\\", \\"Best Graphics\\", and \\"Best VGM\\" (video game music). Cammy, who was introduced in Super, placed fifth in the list of Best Characters of 1993, with Dee Jay and T. Hawk at 36 and 37. GamePro gave a generally positive review of the Genesis version. They wrote that it was a solid conversion of the arcade game, but \\"Super was never the game it could have been in the arcades, and the same imbalances and flaws that hurt the coin-op still affect the home versions.\\" They also said the new features were \\"pretty cosmetic or just downright boring and unimportant\\", and that, music and voices of the Genesis version were all inferior to the SNES version, but concluded \\"Super is still Street Fighter\\" and \\"Street Fighter is still the best fighting game ever made\\". They had given a more positive review for the SNES version, while citing some of the same issues with the core game. Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the SNES version 28 out of 40 (7 out of 10 average), with all four reviewers concurring that though it was the best version of Street Fighter II to date, the additions were limited given how many versions had already been released, and Capcom should have put out a Street Fighter III with new mechanics instead. They made similar comments on the Genesis version, and two of the reviewers additionally criticized that it is worse than the Super NES version due to the poor quality of the digitized voices.

He was the longest-serving holder of the office since the Reformation, and also the first to retire from it. Born in Edinburgh to a Scottish Presbyterian family, Davidson was educated at Harrow School, where he became an Anglican, and at Trinity College, Oxford, where he was largely untouched by the arguments and debates between adherents of the high-church and low-church factions of the Church of England. He was ordained in 1874, and, after a brief spell as a curate, he became chaplain and secretary to the Archbishop of Canterbury, Archibald Campbell Tait, in which post he became a confidant of Queen Victoria. He rose through the Church hierarchy, becoming Dean of Windsor (1883), Bishop of Rochester (1891) and Bishop of Winchester (1895). In 1903 he succeeded Frederick Temple as Archbishop of Canterbury, and remained in office until his retirement in November 1928. Davidson was conciliatory by nature, and spent much time throughout his term of office striving to keep the Church together in the face of deep and sometimes acrimonious divisions between evangelicals and Anglo-Catholics. Under his leadership the Church gained some independence from state control, but his efforts to modernise the Book of Common Prayer were frustrated by Parliament. Though cautious about bringing the Church into domestic party politics, Davidson did not shy away from larger political issues: he played a key role in the passage of the reforming Parliament Act 1911; urged moderation on both sides in the conflict over Irish independence; campaigned against perceived immoral methods of warfare in the First World War and led efforts to resolve the national crisis of the 1926 General Strike. He was a consistent advocate of Christian unity, and worked, often closely, with other religious leaders throughout his primacy. On his retirement he was made a peer; he died at his home in London at the age of 82, eighteen months later. Early years Davidson was born in Edinburgh on 7 April 1848, the eldest of the four children of Henry Davidson, a prosperous grain merchant, and his wife Henrietta, née Swinton.Bell (Volume I), p. 5 Both parents were Church of Scotland Presbyterians – Henry's father, grandfather, and great-grandfather were Presbyterian ministers.Mews, Stuart. \\"Davidson, Randall Thomas, Baron Davidson of Lambeth (1848–1930), archbishop of Canterbury\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2011. .

I have no recollection of receiving any teaching upon Churchmanship, either Episcopal or Presbyterian, the religion taught us being wholly of the personal sort but beautiful in its simplicity.\\"Hughes, p. 10 Davidson's biographer George Bell writes that the Davidsons were deeply religious without being solemn, and that it was a happy household.Bell (Volume I), pp. 5–6 Davidson was educated by his mother and a succession of governesses and private tutors, before being sent, aged 12, to a small private school at Worksop in the English Midlands. The teaching there was inadequate; in particular, Davidson regretted all his life his lack of grounding in Latin and Greek.Bell (Volume I), p. 10 Henry Montagu Butler and Brooke Foss Westcott, inspirations at Harrow In 1862, at the age of 14, Davidson became a pupil at Harrow School. The school was Anglican in its religious teachings and practices, and he took part in confirmation classes. Scarlet fever prevented him from being confirmed along with the other boys at Harrow, and he was confirmed in June 1865 at St George's, Hanover Square by the Bishop of London, Archibald Campbell Tait, a longstanding friend of Henry Davidson.Bell (Volume I), p. 14 The greatest influences on Davidson at Harrow were Henry Montagu Butler, the headmaster, and Brooke Foss Westcott, his second housemaster. Davidson was inspired by Butler's sermons and by Westcott's wide-ranging instruction on topics from architecture and poetry to philosophy and history.Davidson, quoted in Bell (Volume I), p. 16 Davidson and Westcott became lifelong friends, and each came to turn to the other for advice. In the summer holidays of 1866, before his final year at Harrow, Davidson suffered an accident that affected the rest of his life. While rabbit-shooting along with his brother and a friend, Davidson was accidentally shot in the lower back. The wound was severe and could have been fatal, but he slowly recovered. He recalled: Although Davidson gradually made an unexpectedly good recovery, the accident marred his last year at Harrow, where he had hoped to compete for several senior prizes;Bell (Volume I), pp. 20–21 it also ruined his chances of an Oxford scholarship.Hughes, p. 11 Davidson went up as a commoner to Trinity College, Oxford, in October 1867. The college was undistinguished at the time, and Davidson found the Trinity faculty disappointingly mediocre.Bell (Volume I), p. 21 Although high-church versus low-church controversies were rife in Oxford, he was not greatly interested in them, being, as always, more concerned with religious than with liturgical considerations.Bell (Volume I), p. 23 His chief aim was to complete his studies and go on to be ordained as a priest. His health affected his studies; he had hoped to study Greats (classics and philosophy), but as a result of his injuries he had, he later said, \\"intense difficulty in concentrating thought on books\\" and opted for the less demanding subjects of law and history.Barber, p. 415 He graduated with a third class Bachelor of Arts degree, conferred in November 1871.\\"University Intelligence\\", The Times, 18 November 1871, p. 6 After leaving Oxford, Davidson rejoined his family in Scotland and then went with his parents on a six-week tour of Italy. On his return he began a course of study in London with Charles Vaughan, Master of the Temple, with a view to ordination.Hughes, pp. 11–12 Davidson's health was still precarious, and after three months he was obliged to abandon his studies.Bell (Volume I), p. 29 After further rest and another leisurely holiday, this time in the Middle East, he resumed his studies in October 1873 and completed them the following March.Bell (Volume I), p. 33 Curate and chaplain Craufurd Tait, aged 26 One of Davidson's closest friends from his Oxford days was Craufurd Tait, son of Archibald Campbell Tait. Like Davidson, Craufurd was preparing for ordination; his father was by now Archbishop of Canterbury, and the two friends were accepted for ordination as deacons in the Archbishop's diocese. They were ordained in March 1874, and Davidson was assigned as curate to the vicar of Dartford in Kent. He was ordained priest the following year.Bell (Volume I), pp. 33–34 During his two and a half years at Dartford, Davidson served under two vicars; the first was a moderate high churchman and the second a moderate evangelical. Bell writes that the young curate learnt a good deal from each, \\"both in pastoral work and in piety\\".Bell (Volume I), p. 34 Late in 1876 Craufurd Tait, who was working as his father's resident chaplain and private secretary, wished to move on and the Archbishop chose Davidson to succeed him.Hughes, p. 12 In May 1877 Davidson began work at Lambeth Palace, the Archbishop's home and headquarters, beginning what Bell describes as \\"an association with the central life of the Church of England which lasted more than fifty years\\".Bell (Volume I), p. 38 Craufurd Tait died after a brief illness in May 1878;Davidson and Benham, p. 327 his mother never recovered from this blow and died within the year.Davidson and Benham, pp. 334–335Bell (Volume I), pp. 42 and 44 Despite the Archbishop's offers of several attractive parishes over the following years, Davidson felt his place was at the side of the bereaved Tait, who came more and more to rely on him, and called him a \\"true son\\".Bell (Volume I), p. 44 Bell sees this as altruism on Davidson's part; later biographers have suggested that there may also have been an element of personal ambition in his decision to remain at the centre of Church affairs.Bell (Volume I), p. 44; and Hughes, pp. 12 and 14 On 12 November 1878 Davidson married Edith Murdoch Tait (1858–1936), the nineteen- year-old second daughter of the Archbishop. Cosmo Lang, Davidson's friend and eventual successor at Canterbury, described the marriage as a \\"perfect union of mind and spirit\\". Edith Davidson became known as a gracious hostess and a supportive wife. There were no children of the marriage. Archbishop Tait, 1876 Over the next four years Davidson played an increasingly influential role at Lambeth Palace. He grew to know Tait's mind thoroughly, and the Archbishop placed complete confidence in his son-in-law, delegating more and more to him. Davidson took the lead on Tait's behalf in the controversy in 1881 between high-church proponents and evangelical opponents of ritualism; in 1882 he played an important part in discouraging Anglican overtures to the Salvation Army, an organisation in which he thought too much power was in the hands of its general. In 1882 Tait told Davidson that he hoped to be succeeded either by the Bishop of Winchester, Harold Browne, or the Bishop of Truro, Edward White Benson. Tait did not think it correct to make his preference known to Queen Victoria or the Prime Minister, W. E. Gladstone, but after Tait's death in December 1882 Davidson ensured that the Archbishop's views became known to the Queen.Hughes, p. 16 Within days she sent for Davidson and was impressed: she wrote in her diary that she was \\"much struck ... Mr. Davidson is a man who may be of great use to me\\".Quoted in Hughes, p. 15 In the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Stuart Mews comments that at the age of 34 Davidson quickly became the trusted confidant of the 63-year-old queen. When Benson was chosen to succeed Tait, Victoria asked Davidson's views on who should be the next Bishop of Truro; she also consulted him about a successor to the Dean of Windsor, Gerald Wellesley, who died in 1882 after 28 years in the post.Hughes, pp. 15–16 Davidson remained at Lambeth Palace as chaplain and secretary to Benson, but in May 1883 the new Dean of Windsor, George Connor, died suddenly after only a few months in office. On Benson's advice, the Queen appointed Davidson to the vacancy. Dean St George's Chapel, Windsor At Windsor, Davidson served as Dean – and also as the Queen's private chaplain – for six years. She became increasingly attached to him; they developed closer personal relations after the death of her youngest son, Leopold, Duke of Albany, in March 1884. That, and other private tribulations, led her to turn to Davidson for religious consolation and thus, in Bell's words, \\"to give him more and more of her confidence in a quite exceptional way\\".Bell, George. \\"Davidson, Randall Thomas, Baron Davidson of Lambeth (1848–1930), Dictionary of National Biography, Macmillan, 1937 and Oxford University Press, 2004. . Retrieved 9 December 2019 The Queen consulted Davidson about all important Church appointments from 1883 to 1901. In other matters his advice was not always to her taste, and tact was needed to persuade her to change her mind. He wrote in his diary, \\"There is a good deal more difficulty in dealing with a spoilt child of sixty or seventy than with a spoilt child of six or seven\\",Quoted in Roberts, p. 318 but he later said, \\"my belief is that she liked and trusted best those who occasionally incurred her wrath, provided that she had reason to think their motives good\\". His biographers cite his tactful but resolute counsel that Victoria would be imprudent to publish another volume of her Leaves from the Journal of a Life in the Highlands. She reluctantly followed his advice.Bell (Volume I), p. 95; and Hughes, p. 17 As well as advising the Queen, Davidson remained a key adviser to the Archbishop of Canterbury. Benson wrote to him nearly every day, and particularly depended on him in 1888–1890 during the trial of Edward King, the high-church Bishop of Lincoln, on a charge of unlawful ritualistic practices. Davidson helped to influence Church and public opinion by writing in The Times; he also helped Benson by liaising with Lord Halifax, a prominent Anglo-Catholic layman. While Dean of Windsor, Davidson collaborated with Canon William Benham in writing a two-volume biography of Tait, which was published in 1891.\\"The Times Column of New Books and New Editions\\", The Times, 15 June 1891, p. 12 Bishop Rochester By 1890 it was clear that despite the Queen's reluctance to lose him from Windsor, Davidson's promotion to a bishopric was overdue.Bell (Volume I), pp. 189–190 He was offered the choice between two vacant dioceses: Worcester and Rochester.Bell (Volume I), p. 193 At the time – before the creation of the diocese of Southwark – Rochester included all London south of the River Thames, and was the third-largest in England. Davidson chose it in preference to Worcester, explaining to the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, that from his years at Lambeth he knew the area and its clergy so well that he was certain he could do more there than in Worcester, which he hardly knew.Bell (Volume I), p. 194 Davidson in 1890 In Westminster Abbey on 25 April 1891 Benson consecrated Davidson as a bishop.\\"Consecration of New Bishops\\", The Times, 27 April 1891, p. 6 Eleven days later Davidson fell dangerously ill from a perforated ulcer, and was confined to his house in Kennington for six months. His enthronement at Rochester Cathedral had to be postponed until October, when he was able to resume his work.\\"Enthronement of the Bishop of Rochester\\", The Morning Post, 23 October 1891, p. 3 During a miners' strike in 1893 he was prominent in pleading for a decent standard of living as an essential condition for the settlement of labour disputes. His politics were not radical; he did not join the Christian Social Union set up by Westcott and others in 1889 to bring the tenets of Christianity to national economic and social affairs.Hughes, p. 21 He focused on the role of the Church: Christian charity, he believed, required it to do everything possible to help relieve the poor. He rejected the idea that \\"in any department of social life ... we can safely brush aside even for an hour the consideration of what Christ would have us do\\".Hughes, pp. 20–21 Appointed Clerk of the Closet immediately after his consecration, he remained in close touch with Queen Victoria. He continued to be Benson's close and loyal ally in the work of the Church, particularly during 1894–95 when Halifax and other high churchmen attempted to draw the Archbishop into negotiation with Rome to seek papal recognition of Anglican orders. In 1895, towards the end of his time in the diocese, Davidson's seniority as a bishop entitled him to a seat in the House of Lords. He relished the ability to contribute to debates, but he had suffered three more spells of illness during his four years in south London, and it became plain that his health was too poor for him to continue in the exceptionally demanding post of Bishop of Rochester. Winchester As Bishop of Winchester, by Spy in Vanity Fair, 1901 In 1895 Davidson accepted the offer of translation to the largely rural diocese of Winchester, where the workload was less onerous. He renewed his regular contact with the Queen, who spent much time in the diocese, at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. Archbishop Benson died the following year and was succeeded by the Bishop of London, Frederick Temple. The Queen vetoed a proposed offer of the vacant bishopric of London to Davidson, on the grounds that his health would not stand it. Temple, unlike his two predecessors, did not turn to Davidson for advice; he had a reputation for isolating himself from all the bishops and their views. Davidson greatly regretted his sudden exclusion from national Church affairs. Within his diocese Davidson was drawn into controversy over a high-church breach of canon law by Robert Dolling, a fervent Anglo-Catholic priest, who liked to be called \\"Father Dolling\\". Davidson discovered that Dolling had installed a third altar at his newly built church, to be reserved for masses for the dead. The Church of England disowned the Roman Catholic belief in Purgatory and the efficacy of praying for souls in it. Davidson saw Dolling and tried to reach a compromise that would bring the latter's practices within Anglican rules. Dolling refused to compromise and resigned, leaving the diocese.Bell (Volume I), p. 278 His supporters were critical of Davidson; Mews cites a high-church journalist who concluded that the episode left its mark on Davidson \\"in forming his determination not to be the archbishop who drove the high-church party out of the Church of England\\". Though traditionally Protestant in his rejection of some aspects of Roman Catholic doctrine such as Benediction, he thought his evangelical colleagues were too easily upset by \\"incense, copes and other adornments\\", which had no doctrinal significance.Barber, pp. 436–437 Davidson was at the bedside of the dying Queen Victoria, and played a major role in the arrangements for her funeral in early 1901.Hughes, p. 25 When the see of London again fell vacant in February 1901, on the death of Mandell Creighton, it was offered to Davidson, who refused it on firm medical advice.Bell (Volume I), pp. 360–361 He spoke frequently in the House of Lords, particularly on such topics as education, child protection, alcohol licensing, and working hours in shops. He involved himself when he could in national Church policy. His grasp of the issues impressed the Prime Minister, Arthur Balfour, who recorded that \\"the Bishop has the art of stating with great clearness and sympathy the gist of opinions from which he differs\\" and said that he understood the position of Halifax and the Anglo-Catholic lobby better after discussing it with Davidson.Bell (Volume I), pp. 349–350 Balfour continued to seek Davidson's advice. The government sought to reform primary education, and Davidson's input to the framing of the Education Bill of 1902 was greatly valued by Balfour, as was his advice on how to defend the bill against vociferous nonconformist opposition, led by the Baptist minister John Clifford.Bell (Volume I), p. 377 Behind the scenes, Davidson was a key contributor to the coronation of Edward VII in August 1902; the Dean of Westminster was ill, and Davidson was called on to arrange the order of service and to act as the link between Buckingham Palace and Lambeth Palace.Bell (Volume I), p. 370 Four months after crowning the King, Archbishop Temple died and Balfour nominated Davidson as his successor.\\"New Archbishop of Canterbury\\", The Times, 9 January 1903, p. 8 Archbishop of Canterbury When Temple was appointed in 1896 there had been three candidates under consideration for the Archbishopric; in 1902 Davidson was the only one. It was a generally popular choice, except among the more militant Anglo-Catholics. He was enthroned at Canterbury on 12 February 1903.Bell (Volume I), p. 393 From the outset, Davidson, unlike Temple, was happy to turn to colleagues for advice. In a 1997 study, Edward Carpenter describes the most prominent of them: John Wordsworth, Bishop of Salisbury, \\"a man of great if somewhat restricted ecclesiastical learning\\"; Francis Paget, Bishop of Oxford, \\"a scholar and theologian\\"; Edward Talbot, Bishop of Rochester, \\"a practical Diocesan\\"; Cosmo Lang, Bishop of Stepney and later Archbishop of York, \\"a fellow Scotsman who made Lambeth his London home and became almost indispensable\\" and Lord Stamfordham, who had been Queen Victoria's private secretary.Carpenter, p. 411 Davidson's constant concern was for what he called \\"the great central party in the English Church\\".Hastings, p. 83 He was a prime mover in efforts to update the Book of Common Prayer to make it comprehensible to 20th century congregations, and he aimed to accommodate all the clergy of the Church of England within Anglican doctrine, bringing the few high-church extremists back into obedience to Church rules. With his cautious support, Balfour set up a Royal Commission to enquire into and propose remedies for the prevalent disorders in the Church. It concluded that the Church needed more control over its own affairs, but that the laws governing its practices must be enforced.\\"Death of Lord Davidson – Archbishop for 25 Years – A Wise Leader\\", The Times, 26 May 1930, pp. 15–16Bell (Volume I), p. 471 Davidson was neither a diehard conservative nor an adventurous reformer, but steered a middle course. On the government's wish to reform the marriage laws to allow a widower to marry his late wife's sister he opposed reform (unsuccessfully); on the interpretation of the Athanasian Creed he took a liberal line. Davidson, c. 1908 In August 1904 Davidson, accompanied by his wife, sailed to the United States to attend the triennial convention of the American Episcopal Church; he was the first Archbishop of Canterbury to visit the US. He met many Church leaders in the US and Canada, and established closer links between the Anglican Churches of England and North America.\\"The Archbishop of Canterbury\\", The Times, 22 October 1904, p. 9 This accomplishment abroad was followed by a setback at home: Davidson's unsuccessful attempt to bring political leaders to agree about national education policy. The Liberals had opposed the passage of the 1902 Education Act, and once in office in 1906 they reopened the issue. Their attempts at further reform were opposed by the Conservatives, and from 1906 to 1908 Davidson strove to bring the two sides to compromise. His failure to secure agreement and achieve a cohesive primary education system was one of the major regrets of his life.Bell (Volume I), p. 539 In 1907 Davidson disappointed some Liberals by not explicitly backing state old-age pensions, but he declined to do so merely in the abstract, insisting on detailed proposals before expressing support.Bell (Volume I), p. 545 He was much more forthcoming on atrocities by the Belgians in the Congo and the Bulgarians in Macedonia, which he condemned vehemently.Bell (Volume I), pp. 547–548 Lambeth Conference, 1908 In July and August 1908 Davidson presided over the fifth Lambeth Conference of bishops from the world-wide Anglican communion;Bell (Volume I), p. 559 241 bishops were present. The chief subjects of discussion were: the relations of faith and modern thought; the supply and training of the clergy; education; foreign missions; revision and \\"enrichment\\" of the Prayer-book; the relation of the Church to \\"ministries of healing\\" such as Christian Science; the questions of marriage and divorce; organisation of the Anglican Church; and reunion with other Churches. Public interest focused on the bishops' desire for Christian unity. The resolutions showed a will for reunion, but a caution in taking any step towards the nonconformists that might destroy the possibility of ultimate reunion with the Roman Catholic or Orthodox Churches. Domestic affairs, 1909–1911 In 1909 David Lloyd George as Chancellor of the Exchequer found his radical budget blocked by the Conservative majority in the House of Lords; a few bishops voted for or against the government's bill, but Davidson, like most of the 26 Lords Spiritual, abstained. Partisans, both conservative and radical, criticised Davidson for his abstention, but he felt that being identified with one side or the other in party politics would bring the Church into disrepute.Bell (Volume I), p. 600 Parliament Bill in the House of Lords: all but two of the bishops follow Davidson into the pro-government voting lobby (top l.) The Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith, secured the King's reluctant agreement to create as many new peerages for government supporters as was necessary to secure a majority in the Lords. At the end of April 1911 Davidson convened a private meeting at Lambeth Palace to try to resolve the constitutional impasse; the other three attending were Balfour, Lord Knollys and Lord Esher – respectively, Leader of the Opposition, the King's private secretary, and an influential politician and courtier. Balfour said that if invited by the King, he would consider forming a minority Conservative government, so that the question of creating new Liberal peers would not arise; he subsequently decided that he would not be justified in doing so.Rose, p. 123 A week after this meeting Edward VII died, and was succeeded by George V. The Lords continued to resist the will of the Commons, even after a general election fought on the issue. Asquith proposed the 1911 Parliament Bill, to enshrine the supremacy of the Commons in British law, and King George followed his father in agreeing to create hundreds of Liberal peers, should it become necessary to ensure the bill was passed. Davidson, having unsuccessfully striven to bring the party leaders to compromise, voted for the bill. The votes of the Lords Spiritual were crucial in its passage through the Lords, where the majority was only 17.\\"House of Lords\\", The Times, 11 August 1911, p. 5 The two archbishops and eleven bishops voted with the government; two bishops voted against. There were strident protests that the bishops were harming the Church by taking sides, but Davidson had come to regard this as a matter on which the Church must take a stand. He believed that were the bill not passed, the creation of what he called \\"a swamping majority\\" of peers would make Parliament and Britain a world-wide laughing-stock, and would have grave constitutional implications for Church and state. His speech in the Lords was credited with tipping the balance.Bell (Volume I), pp. 629–631 On 22 June 1911, Davidson presided at the coronation of the new sovereign. The service largely followed the form he had arranged for the 1902 service, except for a revised coronation oath, less offensive to the King's Roman Catholic subjects, and Davidson's crowning of both King George and Queen Mary. In contrast, in the 1902 coronation, Queen Alexandra had been crowned by the Archbishop of York.Bell (Volume I), p. 637 When the King left Britain for the Delhi Durbar later in the year, Davidson was one of the four Counsellors of State appointed to transact royal business in the monarch's absence. Kikuyu controversy 1913–1914 Skirmishing between Anglican factions continued with the Kikuyu controversy in 1913–14.Bell (Volume I), p. 690 William George Peel, who was the Bishop of Mombasa and John Jamieson Willis, the Bishop of Uganda, attended an interdenominational missionary conference at the Church of Scotland's parish in Kikuyu, British East Africa, during which they took part in an ecumenical communion service together with their nonconformist colleagues.Bell (Volume I), p. 691 For this, and their agreement to cooperate with other Churches in their missionary work, they were denounced by Frank Weston, the Bishop of Zanzibar. Weston, described by Mews as a \\"champion of Anglo-Catholic hardliners\\", sought their trial for heresy. He was backed by the Bishop of Oxford, Charles Gore, the most vociferous of the Anglo-Catholic bishops. Davidson's private view was that the attending bishops had been \\"rash\\" but the denunciations by Weston and Gore \\"preposterous\\" and \\"absurdly vituperative\\".Barber, p. 433 The issue was debated in the press for several weeks but Davidson's inclusive and pragmatic views prevailed, and the controversy dwindled away. First World War, 1914–1918 Davidson (kneeling, l.) and George V (kneeling, r.) at a service to pray for peace, Westminster Abbey, 1917 The outbreak of the First World War was a severe shock to Davidson, who had held that war between Britain and Germany was inconceivable.Bell (Volume II), p. 731 But he was clear that it was a just war in which it was Britain's duty to fight because of \\"the paramount obligation of fidelity to plighted word and the duty of defending weaker nations against violence\\". He was reconciled to allowing clergy to serve as non-combatants, but not as combatants.Bell (Volume II), p. 739Hughes, p. 91 When a group of theologians in Germany published a manifesto seeking to justify the actions of the German government, Davidson was ready to respond. At the government's request he took the lead in collaborating with a large number of other religious leaders, including some with whom he had differed in the past, to write a rebuttal of the Germans' contentions. But unlike some of his colleagues in the Church, Davidson, in Bell's words, \\"felt the horror of war too keenly to indulge in anti-German rhetoric\\". As The Times put it, \\"He was never betrayed into the wild denunciations and hysterical approval of war to which some ecclesiastics gave utterance\\". He donated to a fund to help Germans and Austro-Hungarians in Britain, where they were classed as enemy aliens.Van Emden, p. 53 Throughout the war Davidson criticised the use of what he considered immoral methods of warfare by the British side. Most of his objections were made privately to political leaders, but some were public, and he was bitterly attacked for them. Mews records \\"hate mail flood[ing] into Lambeth Palace\\". Davidson protested against the false information put out to hide British military reverses, the use of poison gas, the punitive bombing of Freiburg in April 1917 and the targeting of non-combatants. In 1916 he crossed to France for an eight-day visit to combatant troops at the front. While the war was going on, civil strife in Ireland was another matter of concern to Davidson. He spoke against the death sentence passed on Sir Roger Casement for his part in the Easter Rising, and later condemned the violence of the Black and Tans.Marshall, p. 269 In the last year of the war Davidson had to deal with further agitation from the high-church faction. Gore took exception to the liberal theology of Hensley Henson and attempted to thwart the Prime Minister's nomination of Henson for a bishopric.Bell (Volume II), pp. 859–862 Opinion among the laity and most of the clergy was against Gore. Davidson, who hated unnecessary conflict, was distressed by the controversy, and even considered resigning.Grimley, Matthew. \\"Henson, Herbert Hensley (1863–1947), bishop of Durham\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2011. . Retrieved 12 December 2019 But, despite Henson's fear that the Archbishop might weaken,Peart-Binns, p. 91 Davidson stood by him, and the two agreed that Henson would issue a statement of faith to silence the critics. Davidson then stated publicly that no fair-minded man could read Henson's sermons without feeling that they had in him a brilliant and powerful teacher of the Christian faith.\\"Bishopric of Hereford: The Primate's Attitude\\", The Manchester Guardian, 18 January 1918, p. 5 Gore and his followers were obliged to call off their protests.Bell (Volume II), p. 879 Throughout the war, Davidson distanced himself from pacifism. For him, Christian idealism must be accompanied by political realism. He maintained that alongside prayer and witness, Christians had a \\"duty to think\\", and that peace would come \\"when we have given our mind – yes, mind as well as heart – to these new and brave resolves\\".Chapman, p. 27 With this conviction in mind, he was a strong supporter of the League of Nations when it was set up after the war. Enabling Act, 1919 and Welsh disestablishment, 1922 Up to this point the Church of England had little power to make its own rules. As the established Church it was subject to Parliamentary control, and had no independent authority to initiate legislation.Bell (Volume II), pp. 956–957 The Enabling Act, strongly backed by Davidson, gave the Church the right to submit primary legislation for passage by Parliament.Bell (Volume II), p. 968 The historian Jeremy Morris calls it \\"probably the most significant single piece of legislation passed by Parliament for the Church of England in the twentieth century\\", and summarises its effects: Davidson failed to achieve his aims over Welsh disestablishment. Unlike England, Wales had long been mainly nonconformist; the Anglican Church there was widely seen as that of the ruling elite, and its legal status as the official Church of the principality was strongly resented. The historian Callum G. Brown quotes the view that \\"church disestablishment was to Wales what home rule was to the Irish\\".Brown, p. 82 There had been pressure since the 1880s for disestablishment, and bills to bring it about had been unsuccessfully put to Parliament in 1894, 1895, 1911 and 1912. Davidson was against disestablishment, but Parliament finally voted for it in 1914 and after considerable delay it came into effect in 1922.Brown, pp. 82–83 Lambeth Conference, 1920 Procession of bishops at the 1920 Lambeth Conference At Davidson's instigation the sixth Lambeth Conference was held as soon as practicable after the end of the war. It met at Lambeth Palace in July and August 1920; 252 bishops attended. The bishops reaffirmed the Lambeth Quadrilateral – the four fundamentals of the Anglican Communion's doctrine. From this starting-point they developed the major initiative of the conference, the \\"Appeal to all Christian People\\", which set out the basis on which Anglican Churches would seek to move towards union with Churches of other traditions. Other resolutions of the conference welcomed the League of Nations \\"as an expression of Christianity in politics\\", affirmed the eligibility of women for the diaconate, and declared marriage an indissoluble and life-long union, with no acceptable ground for divorce except adultery. The bishops denounced birth control, spiritualism, and attempts to communicate with the dead. Christian Science and theosophy were stated to involve grave error, but were given credit for showing a reaction against materialism.\\"The Lambeth Resolutions\\", The Times, 14 August 1920, p. 11Bell (Volume II), pp. 1007–1015 General Strike, 1926 In May 1926 a general strike was called by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) in an attempt to force the government to do something to prevent wage cuts and ameliorate worsening conditions for British coal miners. Some 2.5 million workers struck from 3 to 12 May, paralysing transport and industry.Butt, p. 391 Davidson sought to play a conciliatory role; the historian G. I. T. Machin calls his intervention \\"probably the most celebrated actions of his twenty-five years as Archbishop of Canterbury\\". Davidson first spoke about the strike on 5 May, addressing the Lords. He expressed disapproval of the strike but called on the Government to act to end the industrial bitterness. Two days later he convened an interdenominational group of Church leaders and they drew up an appeal for a negotiated settlement.Bell (Volume II). pp. 1306–1307 They called for the resumption of talks in a spirit of cooperation, with three tenets: the TUC should call off the general strike, the government should agree to subsidise the coal industry for a short time, and the mine owners should withdraw the disputed wage terms.Machin, p. 38 Davidson wished to make the appeal known to the whole country by making a radio broadcast, but John Reith, the general manager of the BBC, refused to allow it, fearing reprisals from the government.Machin, p. 39 The initiative was only partly successful – though the strike was called off, the miners' grievances were not remedied – but the joint action by Davidson and the other religious leaders was a further step in the direction of unity. One of the nonconformist clerics told Davidson, \\"For the first time in my life it has been possible to feel that the Christian forces in this country were united and courageous, and for that we have to thank your leadership. A new sense of unity has been given to us.\\"The Rev Herbert Gray, quoted in Machin, p. 39 Revision of the Book of Common Prayer The 1662 Book of Common Prayer, which Davidson sought to update The historian Matthew Grimley describes the Prayer-book controversy of 1927–28 as \\"the last great parliamentary battle over Church and state\\".Grimley, p. 143 Davidson – like his Tudor predecessor Thomas Cranmer, according to The Times – had \\"immense and perhaps excessive faith in a new Prayer-book as a means of composing differences and restoring discipline within the Church\\". He also considered that a modern Prayer-book would enrich Anglican services and make them relevant to 20th-century needs unforeseen when Cranmer and his colleagues wrote the original version in the 16th century. Work had been going on under his supervision since 1906, and in 1927 a version was finally ready. The Church Assembly approved it, and it was put to Parliament for authorisation. The House of Lords agreed it by an unexpectedly large majority of 241 votes. The measure then went before the House of Commons, where it was introduced by William Bridgeman, who made a listless speech that did not impress MPs.Bell (Volume II), p. 1345 Opposing, William Joynson-Hicks spoke vehemently, maintaining that the new Prayer-book opened the door to Romish practices.Bell (Volume II), pp. 1345–1346\\"House of Commons\\", The Times, 16 December 1927, p. 7 Davidson privately wrote of Bridgeman's speech, \\"He absolutely muffed it.

The Commons rejected the bill by 238 votes to 205.Bell (Volume II), p. 1346 The MP Austen Chamberlain described Davidson as \\"a tragically pathetic figure as he left ... after the result\\".Grimley, p. 140 The Times said: A second attempt the following year was voted down in the Commons. After that defeat Davidson told the Church Assembly: This statement had the unanimous approval of the bishops. Some of Davidson's colleagues felt that Parliament's rejection of the Prayer-book would have grave consequences. William Temple, his successor-but- one at Canterbury, wrote that \\"some sort of disestablishment is (I suppose) the necessary result\\"; Henson, previously a strong supporter of establishment, now began to campaign against it.Grimley, p. 153 The historian Adrian Hastings writes that \\"by adroitness of manoeuvre and delay\\" Davidson led his fellow bishops away from such a drastic outcome.Hastings, Adrian. \\"Temple, William (1881–1944), archbishop of Canterbury\\".

After showing moderate form as a two-year-old he improved in the spring of 1983 to win the Group Three Lingfield Derby Trial and then won the Classic Epsom Derby, giving Lester Piggott a record ninth win in the race. Teenoso was beaten in his two remaining races that year but showed his best form as a four-year-old, winning the Ormonde Stakes, the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud and, on his final appearance, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. He proved to be a disappointment at stud. Background Teenoso was a dark-coated bay horse with a small white star and a white sock on his left hind leg, bred in Kentucky by Ralph \\"Budgie\\" Moller and his brother, Eric, who owned the colt during his racing career. He was described as a bay when racing, but when standing at stud he was described as being \\"dark bay or brown\\". Teenoso was the best horse sired by Youth, the winner of the Prix du Jockey Club Washington, D.C. International in 1976. His dam, Furioso, who finished second in the 1974 Epsom Oaks, also produced the racemare Topsy, who finished second in the 1000 Guineas and won both the Sun Chariot Stakes and the Prix d'Astarte in 1979. Furioso and Teenoso were two of many successful racehorses descended from the Mollers' broodmare Horama. Others included Lacquer (Irish 1,000 Guineas, Cambridgeshire Handicap), Favoletta (Irish 1000 Guineas), Sovereign (Coronation Stakes) and Violetta (Cambridgeshire). Teenoso was sent into training with Harry Wragg at his Abington Place stables in Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career 1982: two- year-old season Teenoso showed little worthwhile form as a two-year-old in 1982. He finished unplaced on his debut over six furlongs at Newmarket in August and was unplaced again over seven furlongs at Doncaster a month later. Teenoso produced a slightly better effort on his final appearance, when he finished fourth on soft ground at Newmarket. The colt ended the season with earnings of £262. At the end of the year, Harry Wragg retired from training, and his stable was taken over by his son Geoff Wragg. 1983: three-year-old season On Teenoso's first appearance as a three-year-old, he finished second in a ten-furlong maiden race at Haydock Park. The first sign of Teenoso's potential came eleven days later at Newmarket Racecourse, when he contested a maiden race over one and a half miles on heavy ground. The colt took the lead three furlongs from the finish and drew away from his opponents to win easily by eight lengths. The spring of 1983 was unusually cold and wet, leaving many horses struggling to reach peak fitness, while others were unable to cope with the unusually soft, muddy conditions. The continuing wet weather forced the abandonment of several trial races, including the Chester Vase (an intended target for Teenoso) and few of the previous year's leading two-year- olds (including Diesis Dunbeath and Gorytus) showed any worthwhile form. Teenoso's improving form and proven ability on heavy ground saw him made third favourite for the Lingfield Derby Trial in May. He took the lead five furlongs from the finish and stayed on well to win by three lengths from Shearwalk. When Lester Piggott, who had won the race eight times previously, elected to ride Teenoso in the Derby, the colt was strongly supported in the betting and started 9/2 favourite in a field of twenty-one runners. Racing on the heaviest ground seen at Epsom for many years, Teenoso was among the leaders from the start. Piggott sent the colt into the lead early in the straight and he was never in any apparent danger, winning by three lengths from the Irish-trained Carlingford Castle. The winning time of 2:49.07 was the slowest of the 20th century. The Irish Derby at the Curragh three and a half weeks later saw a meeting between Teenoso and the Prix du Jockey Club winner Caerleon. In contrast to Epsom, the ground in Ireland was unusually firm and Teenoso appeared to be unsuited to the conditions as he finished third, beaten by Shareef Dancer, who won impressively, and Caerleon. Teenoso was then trained for the St. Leger Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse in September. In his trial race, the Great Voltigeur Stakes at York in August, he ran disappointingly, finishing third to Seymour Hicks and Dazari. He returned from the race with an injury originally believed to be a stress fracture of the left hind leg. It seemed that Teenoso's injury would end his career, but subsequent examinations revealed it to be less serious than first feared and he was able to return to training in late autumn. 1984: four-year-old season Teenoso made his four-year-old debut in the Group Three John Porter Stakes at Newbury in April. He started favourite, but in his first run for eight months he was beaten into third place behind Gay Lemur and Dazari, both of whom were receiving weight from the Derby winner. In May Teenoso, accompanied by his pacemaker Mill Plantation, was sent to Chester for the Group Three Ormonde Stakes. Teenoso took the lead three furlongs from the finish and won comfortably by a length and a half from Khairpour. His success made him the first Derby winner to win as a four-year-old since Snow Knight in 1975 and the first to win in Europe since Roberto won the 1973 Coronation Cup. In his next race, Teenoso returned to Group One level for the first time since the 1983 Irish Derby as he was sent to France to contest the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud. Piggott positioned Teenoso in fourth place before taking the lead in the straight. Teenoso went two lengths clear of his opponents and held the late challenge of the outsider Fly Me to win by a neck. Shortly before the race Teenoso had thrown his head back, striking Piggott in the face, and the jockey rode the race bleeding heavily from a cut over his right eye. The success was gained on fast ground, contradicting the prevailing opinion that Teenoso needed soft conditions to show his best form. The ground was also firm at Ascot Racecourse in late July, when Teenoso started at odds of 13/2 against twelve opponents in Britain's most prestigious weight-for-age race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. The race attracted a strong field including the 1983 winner Time Charter (who started favourite), Darshaan, Sun Princess, Tolomeo and Sadler's Wells. Piggott sent Teenoso into the lead from the start and set a strong gallop alongside His Honour, who was in the race to set the pace for Sun Princess. Teenoso turned into the straight with a half length lead and then broke clear of his opponents to establish a clear advantage. Sadler's Wells emerged as his only serious challenger and reduced the margin to a length entering the final furlong, but Teenoso pulled away again to win by two and a half lengths. The winning time of 2:27.95 was the second fastest in the race's history. Teenoso was then aimed at the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp in October. He was the 9/4 favourite in the ante-post betting lists when he suffered a slight injury to his right foreleg three days before the race. He was withdrawn from the race on veterinary advice and retired to stud. Assessment and honours The independent Timeform organisation gave Teenoso a rating of 132 in 1983, and 135 in 1984. In the latter year Timeform named the best middle-distance horse of the year. In the official International Classification for 1984, Teenoso was rated the best European older horse and the second best horse of any age behind El Gran Senor. In the voting for the British Horse of the Year award, conducted by the Racegoers' Club, he was beaten by seventeen votes to six by the two-year-old Provideo. In their book A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Teenoso a \\"superior\\" winner of the Derby. Retirement Teenoso began his stud career at the Highclere Stud but struggled to attract high-quality mares and was not considered a success as a stallion. The best of his progeny was probably Young Buster, who won seven races including the Group Three September Stakes. Other successful flat racers included Carlton (Hansa- Preis) and Starlet (Team Trophy der Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken). Teenoso was later moved to the Shade Oak Stud in Shropshire and then to the Pitts Farm Stud at Sherborne in Dorset. Towards the end of his stud career he was standing at a fee of £1,000 and was mainly being used as a National Hunt stallion. The best of his steeplechase performers were Young Spartacus (Mildmay of Flete Handicap Chase, Racing Post Chase) and Horus (Vodafone Gold Cup). In autumn 1999, Teenoso developed thrombosis and was euthanized on October 4 at Pitts Farm Stud.

It is a concept album, which explores various moments in military history, such as the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the American Revolutionary War, and Waterloo. It also pays tribute to world events such as World War I, the World Trade Center attacks and the ravages of Attila the Hun. See the track list for links to the historical context of the songs. The album includes a trilogy entitled Gettysburg (1863). Each of the three songs represents one day in the Battle of Gettysburg, the largest battle ever conducted in the Western Hemisphere and considered the turning point in the American Civil War. This album features the debut of lead singer Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens, formerly of Judas Priest. Owens, who at that time was still in Judas Priest, was asked to do the vocals as a side project. However, he joined the band full-time after Judas Priest reunited with Rob Halford. The album was first recorded with Matt Barlow on vocals, but band leader Jon Schaffer was not satisfied with his performance. Due to the events of September 11, Barlow became more interested in law enforcement than the music business, and according to Schaffer \\"Matt's heart was not in it and it showed in his performance.\\"Jon Schaffer explanation of Matt Barlow's departure. As a result, Matt left the band and the album was shelved until a new vocalist could be found. However, some of Barlow's initial recordings remain on the record as backing vocals, and he is credited with co-writing two songs. This record is the only Iced Earth album to feature Ralph Santolla on lead guitars. This was the last studio album for bassist James MacDonough and drummer Richard Christy. The album was released in three different formats: a limited edition two-disc version in digipak format, and single-disc American and European versions. See the track list for the differences. \\"The Reckoning (Don't Tread on Me)\\", \\"Declaration Day\\", and the acoustic version of \\"When the Eagle Cries (Unplugged)\\" were all released as music videos. Controversy The Glorious Burden received widespread praise from the metal press but was immediately controversial upon its release due to the heavily apparent American exceptionalism in Schaeffer's lyrics. The album was released only a year after the United States invaded Iraq and was engaged in a larger War on Terror since the 9/11 attacks, wars which were viewed as largely unfavorable outside of the United States. During that time opinions about the United States around the world reached a low point and many reviewers were highly critical of the album's lyrical content, including those who lauded the high quality of the overall song composition and production of the album. The criticism around the album's lyrics was so great that at one point Schaffer refused allow Iced Earth to tour countries where unfavorable articles about the album were written, articles that he saw as anti American. Many of these articles came from European countries where a larger, more passionate, and thus more profitable portion of Iced Earth's fanbase resided, meaning the band could loose out on hundreds of thousands of dollars by not touring the continent. Schaffer's move backfired when drummer Richard Christy and bassist James MacDonough threated to leave the band, neither of them willing to forgo their salaries to not tour because of Schaffer's political leanings. He later relented and Iced Earth toured Europe the following year. The band however did not play any songs from The Glorious Burden. After the arrival of frontman Stu Block and the release of their album Dystopia, Iced Earth began to play songs off The Glorious Burden at European venues to great fanfare, first doing so on the Live in Ancient Kourion album.

In medieval literature, the ichneumon or echinemon was the enemy of the dragon. When it sees a dragon, the ichneumon covers itself with mud, and closing its nostrils with its tail, attacks and kills the dragon. The ichneumon was also considered by some to be the enemy of the crocodile and the asp, and attack them in the same way. The name was used for the \\"pharaoh's rat\\", mongoose, or Egyptian mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon), which attacks snakes; it can also mean \\"otter\\". Etymology Ichneumon (ἰχνεύμων) means \\"tracker\\" in Greek. Cockatrice, a name for another mythical beast, derives from calcatrix, a Latin translation of this. The Ichneumon was one of the few who could look at a cockatrice without turning to stone. Primary sources * Pliny the Elder [1st century CE] (Natural History, Book 8, 88): \\"The ichneumon is known for its willingness to fight to the death with the snake. To do this, it first covers itself with several coats of mud, drying each coat in the sun to form a kind of armor. When ready it attacks, turning away from the blows it receives until it sees an opportunity, then with its head held sideways it goes for its enemy's throat. The ichneumon also attacks the crocodile in a similar manner.\\" *Strabo [1st century CE] (Geography, Book 17, edited by H.C. Hamilton, W. Falconer): \\"The ichneumon [is] most destructive both to crocodiles and asps. The ichneumons destroy not only the eggs of the latter, but the animals themselves. The ichneumons are protected by a covering of mud, in which they roll, and then dry themselves in the sun. They then seize the asps by the head or tail, and dragging them into the river, so kill them. They lie in wait for the crocodiles, when the latter are basking in the sun with their mouths open; they then drop into their jaws, and eating through their intestines and belly, issue out of the dead body.\\" * Isidore of Seville [7th century CE] (Etymologies, Book 12, 2:37): \\"That which is produced from the smell of this beast is both healthful and poisonous in food.\\" * Leonardo da Vinci [16th century CE] (The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci edited by Jean Paul Richter): \\"This animal is the mortal enemy of the asp. It is a native of Egypt and when it sees an asp near its place, it runs at once to the bed or mud of the Nile and with this makes itself muddy all over, then it dries itself in the sun, smears itself again with mud, and thus, drying one after the other, it makes itself three or four coatings like a coat of mail. Then it attacks the asp, and fights well with him, so that, taking its time it catches him in the throat and destroys him.\\" * Nemesianus, in the proem to the Cynegetica (a poem about hunting), refers to hunting the Ichneumon on river banks among rushes (line 54). The poem is fragmentary and any longer passage describing such hunt has been lost.

It has also been introduced to Hispaniola, Mauritius and Réunion. This often abundant species occurs in a wide range of open or semi- open habitats, including woodlands and human habitation, and frequently forms large noisy colonies in towns, villages and hotel grounds. This weaver builds a large coarsely woven nest made of grass and leaf strips with a downward facing entrance which is suspended from a branch in a tree. Two to three eggs are laid. Village weavers are colonial breeders, so many nests may hang from one tree. Village weavers feed principally on seeds and grain, and can be a crop pest, but it will readily take insects, especially when feeding young, which partially redresses the damage to agriculture. The calls of this bird include harsh buzzes and chattering.  Taxonomy and systematics William Swainson (1829) Philipp Ludwig Statius Müller provided the first scientific name, Oriolus cucullatus, in his 1776 translation in German of the famous Systema Naturae, written by Carl Linnaeus. The classification provided by Statius Muller was based on a description by Buffon, who in turn made use of work by Mathurin Jacques Brisson. Brisson was the first to publish a black- and-white etching of the bird in 1760. The first colored figure was made by Francois-Nicolas Martinet in a book titled Planches enluminées d'histoire naturelle by Edme-Louis Daubenton, that was published in 1783. The specimen described by Brisson was collected in Senegal by Michel Adanson between 1748 and 1754, and who sent it to René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur in France. Latham eventually gave the scientific name Oriolus textor in 1790. Based on Oriolus textor, Johann Friedrich Gmelin erected in 1825 a new genus he named Textor. This name has priority over the use of the genus name in the combination Textor alecto that Temminck described in 1828, and which is a synonym for the first name of the white-billed buffalo-weaver, Coccothraustes albirostris, as named by Vieillot in 1817, and now assigned to the genus Bubalornis. The species epithet cucullatus is Latin and means \\"hooded\\". In 1789, Johann Friedrich Gmelin distinguished Loxia abyssinica, which was later recognised as a subspecies of the village weaver and for which the new combination P. c. abyssinicus was created. Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot described a slightly different bird that he called subspecies collaris in 1819. Nicholas Aylward Vigors in 1831 distinguished subspecies spilonotus. Etymology The first English name, \\"weever oriole\\" was given by John Latham, an early British ornithologist, whose work was often cited by Linnaeus. \\"Village weaver\\" has been designated the official name by the International Ornithological Committee (IOC). Other English names are \\"black- headed weaver\\", \\"Layard's black-headed weaver\\", \\"black-hooded weaver\\", \\"mottled-backed weaver\\", \\"mottled weaver\\", \\"spotted-backed weaver\\", \\"spot- backed weaver\\", and \\"V-marked weaver\\". Statius Muller gave it the German name \\"Rappendrossel\\", and Brisson named the bird \\"Le Pincon du Senegal\\", in French, and \\"Fringilla senegalensis\\", in Latin, both meaning \\"Senegal finch\\". The bird is known as jesa in Shona, lihlokohloko in Siswati, letholopje in Sesotho, kwera nguya in Kiswahili, thaga in Setswana, ndzheyana in Tsonga, ihobo-hobo in Xhosa and ihlokohloko in the Zulu language. Subspecies Eight subspecies are recognized: * P. c. cucullatus - (Müller, 1766): The nominate subspecies occurs from Mauritania, Senegal and Gambia to southern Chad and Cameroon. It also can be found on Bioko. This nominate subspecies was introduced to Hispaniola. * P. c. abyssinicus - (Gmelin, JF, 1789): Found in northern Sudan, Eritrea and Ethiopia. * P. c. bohndorffi - Reichenow, 1887: Found in southern Sudan, northern Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, western Kenya and north-western Tanzania. * P. c. frobenii - Reichenow, 1923: Found in southern and south-eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. * Mottled weaver (P. c. collaris) - Vieillot, 1819: Found in Gabon, western Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola. * P. c. graueri - Hartert, 1911: Found in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and western Tanzania. * Layard's weaver (P. c. nigriceps) - (Layard, EL, 1867): Found from southern Somalia and eastern Kenya through eastern and southern Tanzania to south-eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, southern Angola and north-eastern Namibia, western Zimbabwe, eastern Zambia and central Mozambique. It also occurs on São Tomé where it was probably introduced. * Spotted-backed weaver (P. c. spilonotus) - Vigors, 1831:, Found in south-eastern Botswana, eastern South Africa and southern Mozambique. This subspecies was introduced to Mauritius, Réunion and Venezuela. Description The village weaver is a stocky 15–17 cm bird with a strong conical bill and dark reddish eyes. In the northern part of its range, the breeding male has a black head edged by chestnut (typically most distinct on the nape and chest). Towards the southern part of its range, the amount of black and chestnut diminish, and the breeding males of the southernmost subspecies only have a black face and throat, while the nape and crown are yellow. In all subspecies the breeding male has a black bill, black and yellow upperparts and wings, and yellow underparts. The non-breeding male has a yellow head with an olive crown, grey upperparts and whitish underparts. The wings remain yellow and black. The adult female has streaked olive upperparts, yellow and black wings, and pale yellow underparts. Young birds are like the female but browner on the back.  Distribution and habitat The village weaver is among the more common weaver bird species, and is widespread in Sub-Saharan Africa, but is absent from the arid regions in the South-West and North-East.  Behavior and ecology Initial stage of nest buildingProgressed stageVillage weavers forage and roost in large groups, often with other weaver species. In some areas, they move periodically along fixed routes. The birds look for food on the ground, but also look up to search vegetation and trees. The village weaver nests in colonies and is very active during the breeding season. Birds fly in and leave again constantly, making a lot of noise. Colonies can contain as many as 150 nests, but anything between eight and a hundred nests in a single tree is usual. A village weaver's nest is long and high. The entrance is mostly extended into a tube of long. The male weaves the structure of the nest using long strips of leaf, that he has torn from palms or large grass species such as Arundo donax. The nest is roofed, ovoid or kidney-shaped, internally consisting of a nesting chamber that is separated by a ground sill from an antechamber, that has the entrance of the entire nest at the bottom. On the inside, the ceiling is made of strips of grass or other leaves, which are simply inserted instead of woven-in. The floor on the inside is lined by short, thatched strips of palm, grass blades or heads, and feathers. The nest requires about three hundred long strips of leaf, which the male tears off and transports one by one. The male gathers building material throughout the building process, during which he works with his feet in exactly the same position, and maintaining the same orientation. He starts by creating the attachment by weaving around mostly two hanging branches just below a fork, a foot on both of them, which he includes in a ring he constructs by weaving in the plain of the branches at the edge of his reach. He than extends the high end of the ring in front of its head, gradually working towards his feet creating a half-globe, that is the nesting chamber. The male continues by constructing the roof of the antechamber, working over his head. This is followed by lining the ceiling, and constructing the entrance tube, hanging upside-down, but still with his feet at the same spots. The weaving technique consists of seizing a strip of near the end and double the strip back on itself. Next he pokes the end with a vibrating movement in between his previous work until it sticks. He then release it, moves his head to the other side of the nest wall, seizes the strip again and pokes it in somewhere. He keeps repeating this, regularly reversing the direction in which he weaves the strip, poking and pulling the strip through holes until the entire length is used. The female collects material too, but she occupies herself only with the lining of the nesting cup.

It is one of the minor bodies of water that constitute the Salish Sea. Hood Canal is not a canal in the sense of being a man-made waterway--it is a natural waterway. Geography Great Bend of Hood Canal from the southeast Hood Canal is long and narrow with an average width of and a mean depth of . It has of shoreline and of tideland. Its surface area is and it contains a volume of water totaling . Hood Canal extends for about southwest from the entrance between Foulweather Bluff and Tala Point to Union, where it turns sharply to the northeast, a stretch called The Great Bend. It continues for about to Belfair, where it ends in a shallow tideland called Lynch Cove. Along its entire length, Hood Canal separates the Kitsap Peninsula from the Olympic Peninsula of Washington. The U.S. Navy's Naval Base Kitsap, Bangor Annex, is located on the eastern shore of Hood Canal near the town of Silverdale. Hood Canal has several internal bays, the largest of which is . Most of Dabob Bay is a Naval Restricted Area, and is used by the submarines stationed at the Bangor Base. Quilcene Bay is an inlet extending northwest from Dabob Bay. Near the north end of Hood Canal is Port Gamble, a bay and a town of the same name. Several rivers flow into Hood Canal, mostly from the Olympic Peninsula, including the Skokomish River, Hamma Hamma River, Duckabush River, Dosewallips River, and Big Quilcene River. Small rivers emptying into Hood Canal from the Kitsap Peninsula include the Union River, Tahuya River, and Dewatto River. Geology An orca breaching in the canal Hood Canal and the rest of Puget Sound were created about 13,000 years ago, during the Late Pleistocene, by the Puget Lobe of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet.Olympic Mountains, USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory History Hood Canal from Camp Parsons Boy Scout Camp Hood Canal was named by the Royal Navy Captain George Vancouver on May 13, 1792, in honor of Admiral Lord Samuel Hood of that navy. Vancouver used the name \\"Hood's Channel\\" in his journal, but wrote \\"Hood's Canal\\" on his charts. The United States Board on Geographic Names decided on \\"Hood Canal\\" as its official name in 1932. Roads and bridges U.S. Route 101 runs along the west shore of Hood Canal, south of Quilcene. Hood Canal is spanned by the Hood Canal Bridge, the third longest floating bridge in the world at . According to the Washington State Department of Transportation, the Hood Canal Bridge is the only floating bridge constructed on saltwater, although there are others, such as Nordhordland Bridge and Bergsøysund Bridge. The Hood Canal Bridge accommodates sixteen and a half foot tides. Recreation State parks on the shores of Hood Canal including Belfair, Twanoh, Potlatch, Triton Cove, Scenic Beach, Dosewallips, and Kitsap Memorial. Prominent shoreside activities include swimming, boating, fishing and shellfish gathering. Theler Wetlands is located at the tip of the Canal in Belfair. It provides a few miles of trails and a protected environment for marsh and estuary birds and plants. There are many small towns located along the length of the Hood Canal, mostly on the western shore. The latter are near hiking and recreation within the Olympic National Forest and the Olympic National Park. Some of the more popular areas include Staircase Campground and Hama Hama Recreation Area and act as the gateways to miles of hiking trails through quiet, lush forests. Low oxygen levels September 2006 marked the discovery of the largest dead zone in the history of Hood Canal. The dead zone may have been caused by low oxygen levels due to algal blooms. Algal blooms occur in part because of warm weather and the slow turnover of water in the southern end of the canal, causing the build-up of nutrients from fertilizers and leaky septic systems. Organic matter, brought in by ocean water and certain trees, could additionally be contributing to the high nitrogen levels in the basin. Excess nutrients and organic matter causes a body of water to lose oxygen, through a process called eutrophication. In Hood Canal, eutrophication has led to unwanted algae blooms. Nitrogen combined with sunlight triggers algal growth. A lack of sufficient consumers has resulted in a mass overgrowth of algae in the basin. When the algae die, bacteria feed and their populations explode, robbing the water of oxygen. A state of hypoxia is created. The fish kill may also be part of a natural 50-year cycle of oxygen levels in the canal, which has merely been influenced (but not controlled) by anthropogenic activity. Natural causes of hypoxia in Hood Canal include the timing of freshwater inflows, water layer stratification resulting from seasonal changes in surface temperature, and climate change. The oxygen level may also be partially due to a change in wind direction. The prevailing north wind generally pushes oxygenated water into the oxygen-depleted area. A sustained south wind will cut off this source of oxygen. Coastal upwelling from the Strait of Juan de Fuca bring in a surplus of nutrients into the Puget Sound, but fail to circulate oxygen through Hood Canal. Chronic hypoxia is observed year-round. This area of low-oxygen is often seen in Lynch Cove, but has been spreading towards the mouth of Hood Canal. In May 2006, divers searching for invasive species discovered a mat of marine bacteria covering a stretch where all normal sea life was dead. The mat dissipated five months later.Dodge, John; \\"Bacterial mass in canal dissipates\\"; The Olympian; October 26, 2006 Jan Newton, oceanographer at the University of Washington, said it was important to note that Hood Canal has had very low oxygen for a long time. Similar mats have been found near Tacoma, Washington; San Diego, California; New York City; and New Orleans, Louisiana. Hypoxia and its detrimental effects on fish have been documented in Hood Canal since the 1970s. But hypoxia's impacts on the area's wildlife have been more significantly linked to growing urbanization along the coast. A recent study determined DO content, oxygen saturation, of the Sound's Main Basin to consistently stay around 5 mg/l from the 1950s up through 2005. DO concentration in Hood Canal, however, was identified to have dramatically decreased from 5–6 mg/l in the 1950s to less than 0.2 mg/l in the twenty-first century. As of 2000, the National Research Council defined hypoxia to occur at a DO level of <2 mg/l—making Hood Canal's current 0.2 mg/l composition far below life-sustaining conditions. Hood Canal's hypoxic state has had devastating effects on the sub-basin's biodiversity. Valuable commercial species such as geoduck clam and Dungeness crab may be adversely affected by hypoxic conditions. Critically low oxygen levels, due to increased bacterial growth, were observed in the lower portion of Hood Canal during the summer months of 2004 and 2005. A low dissolved oxygen content in Anna's Bay and Lynch Cove is believed to have been responsible for the corresponding decline in spot shrimp catch by Skokomish Nation fishers within the same period of time. In 2010, there was a massive fish kill in the southern part of Hood Canal. Hundreds of fish and thousands of shrimp were found washed up onto the shore. Jan Newton, a local oceanographer, concluded that the water contained less than 1 milliliter per liter of dissolved oxygen and that such a low level is extremely stressful, often lethal, to the marine life in Hood Canal. The effects of Hood Canal's hypoxic conditions are clearly seen by the public through massive fish kills, but it is important to identify other harmful impacts resulting from a lack of oxygen in the basin. Eelgrass beds, which are nurseries for salmon and crab, have declined more in Hood Canal than any other area of the Puget Sound. Bottom dwelling rockfish have also seen a decline due to a lack of eelgrass. Other notable cases of hypoxia and its adverse effects on biodiversity include the large-scale hypoxic zone that appears in the Gulf of Mexico each summer. The Hood Canal Dissolved Oxygen Program (HCDOP), a partnership of 38 organizations, has been formed to combat the problem. This program will work with local, state, federal, and tribal government policy makers to evaluate potential corrective actions that will restore and maintain a level of dissolved oxygen that will reduce stress on marine life.HCDOP Goals, Hood Canal Dissolved Oxygen Program; May 24, 2004 The HCDOP-Integrated Assessment and Modeling study was started in 2005 to quantify marine processes and watershed loadings, assess biota-oxygen interactions, model key processes to measure drivers of oxygen, and to evaluate potential corrective actions. Government agencies, such as Puget Sound Partnership and the United States Geological Survey, have used HCDOP's publicly available information to conduct their own assessment and modeling studies of Hood Canal. Puget Sound Partnership is a Washington state agency responsible for protecting and restoring life in the Sound. The group is required to produce a \\"State of the Sound\\" report every two years. As of 2009, the Sound has recently shown signs of increased stress and degradation from human activity. A noticeable drop in spawning rates has had a negative effect on the ecosystem's biodiversity and available habitats continue to decline. But the abundance of some species, like the Chinook salmon, have advanced and limited loadings of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) to Elliott Bay has improved water quality there. Though difficult to regulate, a majority of proposed solutions have recommended the regulation of harmful, nearby anthropogenic practices. Human development has caused the most significant damage to Hood Canal's ecosystem. The runoff from septic tanks dumps large quantities of nitrogen into the canal following each rainfall. The best way to solve this problem is to work with the community to create state of the art sewage treatment plants or, at the very least, upgrade old and damaged septic systems to prevent leaks. Several of Puget Sound's counties have taken it upon themselves to create detailed on- site sewage codes. Because the Hood Canal region has experienced logging, as have the majority of watersheds around Puget Sound, the surrounding forests have become heavily degraded. This has caused nitrogen-rich Alder forests to leach excess nutrients into the water. Restoring wetlands along Hood Canal and restoring native plant life with low nitrogen impacts could help ameliorate this phenomenon. Since wetlands are great filters for the environment, this could prove a very effective way of lowering the impact of nitrogen on the basin. Coastal upwellings and tides are a huge issue for Hood Canal. Because of the lack of upwelling and tides pushing in oxygen rich waters into the canal, the area's oxygen content suffers. Unfortunately, since the Puget Sound ecosystem is so large, it would be very difficult to oxygenate deeper waters. But surface-level DO could be improved by restoring natural flows of estuaries. Icing over During a week of record-breaking cold temperatures in December 2009, parts of Hood Canal developed a thin layer of ice, thicker near the shoreline.Watch: Ice on Hood Canal , KING 5 TV; December 10, 2009 See also *Fjords of the United States *Puget Sound References External links *Hood Canal Coordinating Council *Explore Hood Canal Fjords of Washington (state) Bodies of water of Jefferson County, Washington Bodies of water of Kitsap County, Washington Bodies of water of Mason County, Washington Landforms of Puget Sound Salish Sea ","title":"Hood Canal"},{"id":"707573","text":"Chief Rabbi ( Rav HaRashi) is a title given in several countries to the recognized religious leader of that country's Jewish community, or to a rabbinic leader appointed by the local secular authorities. Since 1911, through a capitulation by Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel, Israel has had two chief rabbis, one Ashkenazi and one Sephardi. Cities with large Jewish communities may also have their own chief rabbis; this is especially the case in Israel but has also been past practice in major Jewish centers in Europe prior to the Holocaust. North American cities rarely have chief rabbis. One exception however is Montreal, with two—one for the Ashkenazi community, the other for the Sephardi. Jewish law provides no scriptural or Talmudic support for the post of a \\"chief rabbi.\\" The office, however, is said by many to find its precedent in the religio-political authority figures of Jewish antiquity (e.g., kings, high priests, patriarches, exilarchs and gaonim). The position arose in Europe in the Middle Ages from governing authorities largely for secular administrative reasons such as collecting taxes and registering vital statistics, and for providing an intermediary between the government and the Jewish community, for example in the establishment of the Crown rabbi in several kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula, the rab de la corte in Kingdom of Castile or the arrabi mor in Kingdom of Portugal, likely influenced by the expectations of their Catholic, Orthodox, and Anglican governments and neighbors.

Israel The position of chief rabbi () of the Land of Israel has existed for hundreds of years. During the Mandatory Period, the British recognized the chief rabbis of the Ashkenazi and Sephardi communities, just as they recognized the Mufti of Jerusalem. The offices continued after statehood was achieved. Haredi Jewish groups (such as Edah HaChareidis) do not recognize the authority of the Chief Rabbinate. They usually have their own rabbis who do not have any connection to the state rabbinate. Under current Israeli law, the post of Chief Rabbi exists in only four cities (Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Haifa, and Beersheba). In other cities there may be one main rabbi to whom the other rabbis of that city defer, but that post is not officially the \\"Chief Rabbi\\".

There is no single rabbi recognised by them as a chief rabbi. The Spanish and Portuguese community, however, consists of several synagogues, charities, a beth din and a kashruth authority. These are under the leadership of an ecclesiastical head. Historically, the individual who fills this role is recognised as a senior rabbi of Anglo Jewry, being the leader of the oldest Jewish community in the country. The Senior Rabbi was traditionally given the title, Haham, meaning \\"wise one\\". Since 1918, however, only Solomon Gaon was given this title. The official title of the holder of this office is now The Senior Rabbi of the S&P; Sephardi Community of the United Kingdom. * Jacob ben Aaron Sasportas (1664–1665) * Yehoshua Da Silva (1670–1679) * Jacob Abendana (1681–1684) * Solomon Ayllon (1689–1700) * David Nieto (1701–1728) * Isaac Nieto (1732–1740) * Moshe Gomes de Mesquita (1744–1751) * Moshe Cohen d'Azevedo (1761–1784) * Raphael Meldola (1806–1828) * Benjamin Artom (1866–1879) * Moses Gaster (1887–1918) * Shem Tob Gaguine (1920–1953) (officially the \\"Ecclesiastical Chief of the Spanish & Portuguese Jews' Congregation,\\" not the Haham) * Solomon Gaon (1949–1995) * Abraham Levy (1995–2012) (officially the Communal Rabbi and Spiritual Head of the Spanish & Portuguese Jews' Congregation, not the haham) * Joseph Dweck (2013–) (elected Senior Rabbi of The S&P; Sephardi Community, not the haham) United States A chief rabbinate never truly developed within the United States for a number of different reasons. While Jews first settled in the United States in 1654 in New York City, rabbis did not appear in the United States until the mid-nineteenth century. This lack of rabbis, coupled with the lack of official colonial or state recognition of a particular sect of Judaism as official effectively led to a form of congregationalism amongst American Jews. This did not stop others from trying to create a unified American Judaism, and in fact, some chief rabbis developed in some American cities despite lacking universal recognition amongst the Jewish communities within the cities (for examples see below). However, Jonathan Sarna argues that those two precedents, as well as the desire of many Jewish immigrants to the US to break from an Orthodox past, effectively prevented any effective Chief Rabbi in America.

Biography  D'Amboise was born as Joseph Jacques Ahearn in Dedham, Massachusetts. His father was Irish American while his mother was of French Canadian ancestry. According to D'Amboise, his mother Georgette D'Amboise convinced his father in 1946 to change his and their children's surname (Ahearn) to her surname (D'Amboise) because it was \\"aristocratic, French and a better name\\". This also included taking French first names, and thus he took his middle name \\"Jacques\\" instead of \\"Joseph\\".Laura Jacobs. \\"Book Review: I Was a Dancer\\", The Wall Street Journal March 2011 He was a principal dancer with the New York City Ballet, where ballets were created especially for him by choreographer George Balanchine.

Portal hypertension is defined as a hepatic venous pressure gradient. Cirrhosis (a form of chronic liver failure) is the most common cause of portal hypertension; other, less frequent causes are therefore grouped as non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. When it becomes severe enough to cause symptoms or complications, treatment may be given to decrease portal hypertension itself or to manage its complications. Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms of portal hypertension include: * Ascites (free fluid in the peritoneal cavity), ** Abdominal pain or tenderness (when bacteria infect the ascites, as in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis). * Increased spleen size (splenomegaly), which may lead to lower platelet counts (thrombocytopenia) * Anorectal varices * Swollen veins on the anterior abdominal wall (sometimes referred to as caput medusae) In addition, a widened (dilated) portal vein as seen on a CT scan or MRI may raise the suspicion about portal hypertension. A cutoff value of 13 mm is widely used in this regard, but the diameter is often larger than this is in normal individuals as well. Causes The causes for portal hypertension are classified as originating in the portal venous system before it reaches the liver (prehepatic causes), within the liver (intrahepatic) or between the liver and the heart (post-hepatic). The most common cause is cirrhosis (chronic liver failure). Other causes include:2013 Prehepatic causes * Portal vein thrombosis * Splenic vein thrombosis * Arteriovenous fistula (increased portal blood flow) * Splenomegaly and/or hypersplenism (increased portal blood flow) Hepatic causes * Cirrhosis of any cause. For example: ** alcohol abuse ** chronic viral hepatitis ** biliary atresia ** Primary biliary cirrhosis * Primary sclerosing cholangitis * Chronic pancreatitis * Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia * Schistosomiasis * Congenital hepatic fibrosis * Nodular regenerative hyperplasia * Fibrosis of space of Disse * Granulomatous or infiltrative liver diseases (Gaucher, mucopolysaccharidosis, sarcoidosis, lymphoproliferative malignancies, amyloid deposition, ...) * Toxicity (from arsenic, copper, vinyl chloride monomers, mineral oil, vitamin A, azathioprine, dacarbazine, methotrexate, amiodarone etc.) * Viral hepatitis * Fatty liver disease * Veno-occlusive disease Posthepatic causes * Inferior vena cava obstruction * Right-sided heart failure, e.g. from constrictive pericarditis * Budd–Chiari syndrome also known as hepatic vein thrombosis Pathophysiology Stellate cell The pathophysiology of portal hypertension is indicated by increased vascular resistance via different causes; additionally, hepatic stellate cells and myofibroblasts are activated. Increased endogenous vasodilators in turn promote more blood flow in the portal veins. Nitric oxide is an endogenous vasodilator and it regulates intrahepatic vascular tone (it is produced from L-arginine). Nitric oxide inhibition has been shown in some studies to increase portal hypertension and hepatic response to norepinephrine. Diagnosis Portal hypertension due to cirrhosis resulting in revascularization of the umbilical vein Ultrasonography (US) is the first-line imaging technique for the diagnosis and follow-up of portal hypertension because it is non-invasive, low-cost and can be performed on-site. A dilated portal vein (diameter of greater than 13 or 15 mm) is a sign of portal hypertension, with a sensitivity estimated at 12.5% or 40%. On Doppler ultrasonography, a slow velocity of <16 cm/s in addition to dilatation in the main portal vein are diagnostic of portal hypertension. Other signs of portal hypertension on ultrasound include a portal flow mean velocity of less than 12 cm/s, porto–systemic collateral veins (patent paraumbilical vein, spleno–renal collaterals and dilated left and short gastric veins), splenomegaly and signs of cirrhosis (including nodularity of the liver surface). The hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement has been accepted as the gold standard for assessing the severity of portal hypertension. Portal hypertension is defined as HVPG greater than or equal to 5 mm Hg and is considered to be clinically significant when HVPG exceeds 10 to 12 mm Hg. Treatment The treatment of portal hypertension is divided into: Portosystemic shunts Fluoroscopic image of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) Selective shunts select non-intestinal flow to be shunted to the systemic venous drainage while leaving the intestinal venous drainage to continue to pass through the liver. The most well known of this type is the splenorenal. This connects the splenic vein to the left renal vein thus reducing portal system pressure while minimizing any encephalopathy. In an H-shunt, which could be mesocaval (from the superior mesenteric vein to the inferior vena cava) or could be, portocaval (from the portal vein to the inferior vena cava) a graft, either synthetic or the preferred vein harvested from elsewhere on the patient's body, is connected between the superior mesenteric vein and the inferior vena cava. The size of this shunt will determine how selective it is. With the advent of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS), portosystemic shunts are less performed. TIPS has the advantage of being easier to perform and doesn't disrupt the liver's vascularity. Prevention of bleeding Both pharmacological (non-specific β-blockers, nitrate isosorbide mononitrate, vasopressin such as terlipressin) and endoscopic (banding ligation) treatment have similar results. TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting) is effective at reducing the rate of rebleeding. The management of active variceal bleeding includes administering vasoactive drugs (somatostatin, octreotide), endoscopic banding ligation, balloon tamponade and TIPS. Ascites The management of ascites needs to be gradual to avoid sudden changes in systemic volume status which can precipitate hepatic encephalopathy, kidney failure and death. The management includes salt restriction, diuretics (spironolactone), paracentesis, and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. Hepatic encephalopathy A treatment plan may involve lactulose, enemas, and use of antibiotics such as rifaximin, neomycin, vancomycin, and the quinolones. Restriction of dietary protein was recommended but this is now refuted by a clinical trial which shows no benefit. Instead, the maintenance of adequate nutrition is now advocated.

Military service and desertion Jenkins was born in 1940 in Rich Square, North Carolina. He joined the Army National Guard in 1955, aged 15, below the minimum enlistment age. He joined the Regular Army in 1958 and was assigned to the 1st Cavalry Division. He served in South Korea from 1960 to 1961, in West Germany from 1962 to 1964, and in South Korea again. In South Korea, Jenkins was assigned to night patrols. He was alarmed about the prospect of being sent to what he considered a certain death in Vietnam. On the evening of January 4 or 5, 1965, he crossed into North Korea \\"after guzzling 10 beers for courage\\", and surrendered to forces there. His hope was that he would be sent to the Soviet Union and then, through prisoner exchange, eventually returned to the United States. Shortly thereafter, North Korean propaganda declared that a U.S. sergeant had defected, and broadcast statements allegedly made by the defector, reportedly in stilted English. The U.S. Army claimed Jenkins wrote four letters stating his intention to defect (an allegation Jenkins denied); however, the original letters are reportedly lost. His relatives maintained throughout his absence that he was abducted. Life in North Korea Information about Jenkins' status was unavailable outside North Korea for many years. Jenkins said he almost immediately regretted his desertion. He said that for seven years, until 1972, he and three other U.S. servicemen—Larry Abshier, Jerry Parrish, and James Dresnok—were quarantined in a one-room house with no running water, where they were made to study the Juche philosophy of Kim Il-sung daily. They were forced to memorize large passages of Kim's writings in Korean, and beaten frequently by their guards. He said that at one point in 1966, he found his way to the Soviet embassy in Pyongyang and requested asylum, which was denied. Eventually, Jenkins was placed in separate housing and began teaching English at the Pyongyang University of Foreign Studies. In 1980, 40-year-old Jenkins was introduced to 21-year-old Hitomi Soga, a Japanese nursing student who had been abducted by North Korean agents in 1978, along with her mother, during a search for Japanese citizens who could train future spies in Japanese language and culture. Soga's mother was never heard from again, and Soga was \\"given to\\" Jenkins. Thirty-eight days after meeting, they were married. They had two daughters, Roberta Mika Jenkins (born 1983) and Brinda Carol Jenkins (born 1985). In 1982, Jenkins appeared in the North Korean film Unsung Heroes, which provided the first evidence to the Western world that he was alive. The U.S. government did not publicly reveal this information until 1996. Confirmation and return Jenkins in September 2004, getting a haircut to conform to US Army grooming regulations Jenkins drew international interest again in 2002, when North Korean leader Kim Jong-il confirmed that North Korea had abducted Japanese citizens. In an effort at détente, surviving abductees were allowed to travel to Japan, including Jenkins' wife. The visit was intended to last for a week, but the Japanese government chose not to return them on schedule and instead negotiated for their families to join them in Japan. Most of the families did ultimately travel to Japan, but Jenkins and his daughters stayed behind out of fear that the North Korean government was testing his loyalty. After assurances of protection from the Japanese government, he traveled with his daughters to Japan by way of Indonesia for medical treatment, arriving in Japan in July 2004. Japan formally requested a pardon for Jenkins, which the U.S. declined to grant. After expressing a desire to put his conscience at rest, Jenkins reported on September 11, 2004, to Camp Zama in Japan. He reported in respectful military form, saluting the receiving military police officer. On November 3, Jenkins pleaded guilty to charges of desertion and aiding the enemy, but denied making disloyal or seditious statements – the latter charges were dropped. He was sentenced to 30 days' confinement, received a dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and benefits and was reduced in rank to E-1 private (the lowest rank in the US Army). He was released six days early, on November 27, 2004, for good behavior. Jenkins and his family settled on Sado Island in Japan, which is Soga's home. On June 14, 2005, Jenkins, his wife, and two daughters traveled to the United States to visit his 91-year-old mother in North Carolina, returning later in the month. He found work as a greeter at a shop in Japan. There were three other U.S. deserters who remained in North Korea as well: James Joseph Dresnok (who was interviewed for a 2006 British documentary Crossing the Line), Private Larry Allen Abshier, and Specialist Jerry Wayne Parrish. The former two defected in 1962, while the latter defected in 1963. Dresnok continued to live in North Korea until his death in 2016. According to North Korean official reports, Abshier and Parrish died of natural causes while living in that country.\\"An American in North Korea\\", 60 Minutes, CBS Television. Produced by Robert G. Anderson and Casey Morgan. Reported by Bob Simon. First broadcast on January 28, 2007. On July 15, 2008, Jenkins obtained permanent residency status in Japan, a month after he applied for the status.

Revival In the aftermath of the \\"Empyre\\" storyline, the Unseen uses his powers to bring the Cotati's weapons to him so that he could learn how a pacifistic race like the Cotati had gained them. Once he began analyzing them, the Unseen realizes the weapons were created by the First Race, and is overcome with energy as the one-eyed Uatu is brought back to life. When the Unseen asks how he is back from the dead and to at least say something, all Uatu says is \\"There shall be...a reckoning.\\"Empyre: Fallout Fantastic Four #1. Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities As a member of the race of Watchers, Uatu possesses vast psionic abilities which have been further developed through training. These abilities include flight, telepathy, energy- manipulation powers, power-negating force-field projection, illusion casting, the ability to psionically alter his appearance at will, and highly advanced cosmic senses allowing him to be aware of countless events of Earth. His superhumanly complex intelligence enables him to monitor activities throughout Earth's solar system simultaneously. Uatu can convert his body into an unknown form of energy while still retaining his sentience for travel through hyperspace, and then return to his physical form. Bolstered by treatment with \\"delta-rays\\", Uatu possesses virtual immortality, although he can die by losing the will to live. He has shown he is able to transport himself and others through time,Strange Tales #134. Marvel Comics. and in one issue he claims he can send someone to Limbo.Fantastic Four #18. Marvel Comics. Watchers can augment their strength with cosmic psionic energy if they choose to; however, they tend to minimize their physical activities. The 1985 edition of the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe compared Uatu's scale of power to that of Galactus, the Stranger, Odin, and Zeus. Uatu received a highly extensive education in his youth on his home world. He has devoted himself to the study of Earth's solar system and its sentient beings for millions of years. His home on the Blue Area of the Moon contains an enormous array of weaponry, artifacts, and technology created by various alien races from throughout the universe. Uatu also studies the Earths of alternate realities. With permission from the Timekeepers, he possesses a portal through which he can observe alternate realities. He has acquired extraordinary knowledge of the history of both the sentient beings on \\"mainstream\\" Earth and the numerous alternate Earths. Other versions *In the alternate universe of the 1999 miniseries Earth X, Uatu is portrayed as a cold, nihilistic manipulator who feels no empathy for the people of Earth whom he watches. This is partially because he has been blinded by an Earthling, Black Bolt, and partially because the planet he is watching is nothing but the primal cocoon of an unborn Celestial, and the humans inhabiting it are mere \\"antibodies\\", a natural line of defense for constant menaces. Also, Uatu (who watches the events on Earth from a base on the moon) is the original inspiration for the Egyptian moon god Khonshu. *The 2003 miniseries Marvel 1602 reveals that, although The Fantastic Four #13 was the first time he broke his oath, the anomalous appearance of Marvel's superheroes more than 300 years early — speculated by Uatu to be the result of the universe trying to create the means to save itself from a temporal anomaly — forced him to severely bend his oath by communicating with the 1602 version of Doctor Strange prior to the latter's death. Uatu's deal with Strange prevented Strange from telling anyone else about the danger facing the world while he lived while allowing him to communicate that knowledge with others after his physical body's demise. As a result, he must maintain a pocket universe containing the 1602 world within himself. The Overmind of the Watchers notes that, as much as they are ashamed of him, they are proud of him for saving the multiverse.Marvel 1602 #8 (2004). Marvel Comics. *At the end of the main story in each issue of the 2008 miniseries Marvel Apes, a gorilla version of the Watcher can be seen telling stories from the past and trying to get around to a story of the \\"Marvel Apes Age\\". In issue #2, he becomes drunk after drinking an \\"Ultimate Nullifier\\", which he claims is like a martini, only mixed with \\"Kirby Dots\\". In his drunken state, he complains about how boring it is to watch everything all the time. He also reveals that he is infatuated with the ape version of the Wasp. In his drunken ranting, he goes so far as to ask the reader if they \\"wanna make out\\", then after realizing what he has said, apologizes and tries to explain himself. He usually tells stories that entertain him, such as the story of giant cowboy rat men and homosexual cowboy-apes, or the story of how Odin sentenced the Thorangutang to learn humility by becoming a doctor in the upbeat, rich city of Manhattan. *In the 2009 miniseries Marvel Zombies Return, a version of Uatu witnesses the Zombie Spider-Man's arrival in his universe. After being horrified by the nature of the infection, he decides to travel to other universes to warn others of the infection, but the zombie Giant-Man appears and bites off Uatu's head, planning to use his communicator to traverse the multiverse and satiate his hunger.Marvel Zombies Return #1 (November 2009). Marvel Comics. At the end of the series, Uatu returns, stating he was pure energy, and thus could not be infected by the virus. With Giant-Man unable to master his technology before Spider-Man found a means of destroying most of the zombies, Uatu then proceeds to trap the last zombie, the Sentry, in a time-loop paradox by sending him back in time to Earth-2149, starting the entire Marvel Zombies Saga from the beginning and keeping the zombie infection contained in these two realities so that it will 'devour itself'. He eventually congratulated the Sandman for his help; Flint Marko had destroyed all the other mobile zombies by dispersing a nanite cure devised by Spider- Man.Marvel Zombies Return #5 (November 2009). Marvel Comics. *In the alternate MC-2 Universe, Uatu made several appearances regarding its last two miniseries, Last Hero Standing and Last Planet Standing. In the former, he briefly related the history of the MC-Universe; in the latter, he died while standing in the way of Galactus and his herald. *In the reality seen in the 2004 miniseries Powerless, reality is turned upside down and is told from the point of view of psychiatrist William Watts, who in the very end is revealed to be the Powerless version of Uatu. Watts encounters non-powered versions of Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Daredevil, who face problems similar to their super-powered counterparts from Earth-616. Just as in Earth-616, Uatu finds that he cannot remain detached and watch as his patients' lives are ruined, and tries to come to their aid,Powerless #1-6 (August 2004 – January 2005). Marvel Comics. but, like his original incarnation, he never acts directly, instead inspiring and guiding the heroes. He even watches the city using a telescope, before the last panel revelation that he is Uatu. *The Ultimate Marvel version of Uatu is not a person, but a highly advanced alien computer that observes everything. Ultimate Watcher resembles a stone totem of sorts with a glowing red eye. It is able to manifest in many locations at once. It has been observing Earth for some time and was present when Captain America received his powers.Ultimate Origins #1-4 (August–November 2008). Marvel Comics. However, it appears that there is more than one Watcher in the Ultimate universe, for in Ultimate X-Men #96 Jean Grey attempts to find heaven to resurrect her father, only to be stopped by a Silver Surfer that is stationed in front of thousands of Watchers in a hive colony.Coleite, Aron Eli (w), Mann, Clay; Peterson, Brandon (p), Cuevas, Carlos Lobo (i). \\"Absolute Power: Part 3\\" Ultimate X-Men #96 (September 2008).

Location and features The building is a stark white, modernist column in an octagonal floorplan, with eight massive load- bearing columns in the corners that taper slightly towards the top. It is one of the world's tallest reinforced concrete buildings and was one of the tallest buildings in the world outside North America at the time of its completion.

Occupants include the Sydney Consulate of the United States of America. The podium of the building includes a shopping centre and a 1,186-seat theatre, the Theatre Royal. The building underwent a $100m repair project which installed hybrid corrosion protection to the facade. The project retained the original appearance of the structure but remedied damage to exposed aggregate precast concrete facade panels caused by expansive corrosion of steel reinforcement. Site controversy The building's construction was controversial, since it brought about the demolition in 1971-2 of the famous 19th century Australia Hotel, the Theatre Royal, and the splendid Commercial Travellers Club building on the corner of Martin Place, all of which formerly stood on the site, as well as much of the historic Rowe Street precinct.

He became a public benefactor who funded notable buildings that still survive today. Career GRT CS Hooper, the World's first purpose-built cable-laying ship. She was renamed CS Silvertown in 1881 and is pictured here in 1901. He attended Aberdeen University. After an engineering apprenticeship in London, he became a ship designer working for John Coutts' Newcastle upon Tyne yard in 1842. He became a shipbuilder in his own right at the Low Walker yard on the Tyne in 1852.History of the Low Walker Shipyard Communigate The cable ship Hooper, second in size only to SS Great Eastern and the first ship designed specifically to lay trans Atlantic cable, was launched for Hooper's Telegraph Works at the yard on 29 March 1873 after four and a half months construction. That shipyard joined in partnership with the Armstrong yard to form Armstrong Mitchell in 1882. He was decorated with the Imperial Order of St Stanislaus, 2nd class (normal for foreign nationals), which may be seen in the coat of arms over the door of Jesmond Towers. Jesmond Towers, until 2008 the La Sagesse School, is a gothic revival building that was built in several stages in the nineteenth century. The main work is by the Newcastle architect John Dobson. In 1871, Mitchell was among those greeting the High Admiral, Grand Duke Konstantin at Newcastle Central station, after which the party drove on to Jesmond Towers. The Russian guests had come to visit the Low Walker yard and have a quick tour of the river. In 1887 Mitchell commissioned the art nouveau church of St George, Jesmond from Thomas Ralph Spence (1845–1918), secretary of the Newcastle Arts Association. The building is tall and dramatic inside and of excellent workmanship throughout (commented upon by George Bernard Shaw on his visit in the 1890s). The stained glass is especially fine, and the mosaic figures were designed by Mitchell's own son, C.W. Mitchell. The Lewis organ was originally provided with air by two powerful hydraulic engines supplied by Mitchell's neighbour in Jesmond Dene, Baron Armstrong. In Jesmond he gave the land from the Jesmond Towers estate and £30,000 for the construction of the art nouveau St George's church (1888). Until his death at the age of 75 he directed the ship building activities of Sir W.G. Armstrong, Mitchell and Co. In 1897, after he died, the firm became Armstrong Whitworth which is now part of Rolls Royce plc and BAE Systems.

It is located in a residential area east of Shoreview Park. The college contains over 80 acres and continuously serves 12,000 full- and part- time students. It opened in 1964 and offers degree and certificate programs. The campus is made up of 26 buildings including an award-winning automotive training center, a visual arts building, computer centers, laboratories, a student center, a theater, a gymnasium, a child care center, a multimedia center, and the Ray W. Howard Library/Technology Center. Shoreline also offered off-site classes in the early nineties. Shoreline offers basketball, baseball, softball, volleyball, fencing, weight lifting and intramural volleyball programs, and scholarships to athletes.  History  Some elements of SCC's architecture and landscaping are reminiscent of Japanese traditions. Note the high roof element and the rocks representing a stream as in a traditional Japanese garden. Shoreline Community College was the brain-child of Dr. Ray W. Howard, superintendent of the Shoreline School District. He felt that Washington state's increasing host of high school graduates did not have adequate opportunities for higher education and \\"actively worked with other school districts in the area to convince legislators of the needs of 'non- traditional' students who could not, because of economic circumstances, attend the University of Washington or other four-year institutions.\\" In 1959 he brought forward the idea of a community college in Shoreline. Shoreline Community College started with evening classes in January 1964, accepting 806 student applications that would be taught at Shoreline High School which is now Shoreline Center. Dr. Howard \\"retired as superintendent in 1963, and spent his last two years with the district planning and opening the new Shoreline Community College.\\" \\"The Boeing family eventually donated approximately 83 acres on a wooded bluff to Shoreline Community College,\\" and the site was cleared for construction in the early 1960s. \\"In the fall of 1965, the new campus was ready for students.\\" According to a study released in October 2013, Shoreline Community College is the best value for an associate degree in the state of Washington and among the best in the nation. As pointed out in the study, graduates are shown to earn $456,269 more in their lifetime than they would without the associate degree. Academics Shoreline Community College offers several transfer degrees and more than 100 professional, technical, and workforce training degrees and certificates, some short-term, others taking up to two years to complete. Shoreline Community College has international students enrolled from 45 countries. Over 140 scholarships are awarded annually, as well as over $14.4 million in financial aid.  National Alternative Fuels Training Consortium  In 2006 Shoreline Community College was recognized as one of 27 colleges nationwide to offer NAFTC's alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) training and outreach center. The school's automotive program has received statewide recognition for its specialized program.  Library  The library on campus was one of the first three buildings to be constructed when the college was founded. In 1981 the library was named in honor of Ray W. Howard near the time of the founding superintendent's retirement. It was remodeled in late 2016 and early 2017. Recently celebrating its 5 millionth visitor, the Ray W. Howard library serves students of Shoreline Community College, faculty, staff, and has some services available to the general public. Students of participating nearby colleges may use their institution's ID card to check out materials from the library as well. The Ray Howard Library has a print collection that includes nonfiction, reference, foreign language materials, an ESL collection, journals, magazines, and a small popular books section with some graphic novels. While the print collection is supportive of Shoreline Community College's curriculum, the digital resources include academic and trade journals, magazine and newspaper articles, e-books, reference books, and streaming video. There are three computer labs in the Ray W. Howard Library that provide access to all the digital resources without a login as well as a long list of software. The librarians teach workshops, consultations and individual sessions to students and others who are learning the research process. Students and other users can request a Librarian Prescription, on which Librarians will note keywords, key resources, and ideas for the research process. Ray W.

He was the second Englishman to be ordained as a Buddhist monk (Bhikkhu) of the Theravada traditionBatchelor, Stephen The Awakening of the West, p. 40. and was instrumental in introducing Buddhism in England. He established the first Buddhist Mission in the United Kingdom. Early life Allan Bennett was born in London on 8 December 1872. His father, a civil engineer, died when he was still a boy. He was raised as a strict Roman Catholic by his mother; a faith which he had rejected whilst in his teens. There is reference to his having at least one sister. He was educated at Hollesley College and later at Bath, England. Upon leaving school, he trained as an analytical chemist and achieved some success in that field for he was invited to participate in an expedition to Africa by Dr. Bernard Dyer, chemist to the Corn Trade; however, he did not go in the end. His electrical knowledge was profound while still in his early twenties; this and his talent for experimental science, mathematics and physics would stay with him throughout his life. Golden Dawn Bennett was, along with George Cecil Jones, Crowley’s primary teacher during his days in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Bennett was educated at Hollesly College, and scraped by as an analytical chemist. Bennett was initiated into the G.D. in 1894, taking the motto \\"Iehi Aour\\" (\\"let there be light\\"). He was always very poor and tormented by illness, but still made a strong impression on other occultists of the time. Bennett was one of the most brilliant minds in the order, and favored mysticism and white magic; he was almost wholly concerned with enlightenment rather than siddhis (magical powers). Bennett had high regard for Golden Dawn leader S. L. Mathers, and with him began working on a book of Hermetic Qabalah correspondences that Crowley would later expand upon as Liber 777. Soon after meeting, Crowley invited Bennett to come stay with him, as Bennett was living in a dilapidated shared apartment. In return, Bennett trained Crowley in the basics of magic and tried to instill a devotion to white magic. Bennett was generally ascetic and sexually chaste, a marked contrast to Crowley’s libertine attitude. Nevertheless, he was an enthusiastic user of mind changing drugs (with which he treated recurrent asthma) and introduced Crowley to this aspect of his occult researches.Symonds p. 18 Crowley once remarked concerning Bennett’s powers: Bennett had constructed a magical wand out of glass, which he carried with him. Crowley himself stated it to look similar in appearance to a chandelier. As it so happened, Crowley and Bennett were walking along one day and came across a group of theosophists who were ridiculing the use of wands. \\"Allan promptly produced his and blasted one of them. It took fourteen hours to restore the incredulous individual to the use of his mind and his muscles.\\" Travel to Southeast Asia At some time between 1889 and 1900, in his late twenties, Bennett traveled to AsiaHumphries C, Ananda Metteyya: With Some Observations on the English Sangha, The Middle Way Nov 1972:133-136.Crow J (University of Amsterdam), The Bhikku and the Magus, Conference 2008 to relieve his asthma, and to dedicate himself to Buddhism. First he traveled to Ceylon where he studied Hatha Yoga under the yogi Shri Parananda. He joined the Sangha and took the name Swami Maitrananda.Golden Dawn Biographies, Allan Bennett Later, in Burma, Bennett took the vows of a Buddhist monk, and assumed the name Ananda Metteyya, \\"Bliss of loving kindness.\\" In 1902 Crowley came to visit him there and was instructed in Hatha Yoga. At this time both men were agreed as to the validity of Buddhist practices. In 1903 he founded the Buddhasasana Samagama or the International Buddhist Society in London, UK (not to be confused with the International Buddhist Society in British Columbia, Canada). Bennett later began a periodical called Buddhism: An Illustrated Review. Death Some sources say that Bennett intended to travel to California due to health reasons. But with the outbreak of World War I and the denial of an immigration visa by the US, he found himself stranded, and forced to live in poverty and illness. He died on his native English soil at the age of 51, on 9 March 1923, buried at Morden cemetery. His lifelong friend and Buddhist writer, Dr Cassius Pereira, wrote: \\"And now the worker has, for this life, laid aside his burdens. One feels more glad than otherwise, for he was tired; his broken body could no longer keep pace with his soaring mind. The work he began, that of introducing Buddhism to the West, he pushed with enthusiastic vigour in pamphlet, journal and lecture, all masterly, all stimulating thought, all in his own inimitably graceful style. And the results are not disappointing to those who know.\\"D r Elizabeth J Harris, Ananda Metteya, the First British Emissary of Buddhism, The Wheel Publication No.420/422 1998 . (She is citing The Buddhist, 28 April 1923, p.6.) Legacy Allan Bennett was a pioneer, and without him, Buddhism would not have entered the Western world as it did. He wrote two books: The Wisdom of the Aryas (1923)(based in part on a series of discourses in Clifford Bax's studio in 1919 and 1920See page 290(Sec XX) of Inland Far, by Clifford Bax, 1925) and The Religion of Burma (1911, reprinted in 1929 by Theosophical Publishing House as The Religion of Burma and Other Papers). Some of his addresses and papers are still intact and used today. Notes References *Brunton, Paul A Pioneer Western Buddhist. *Crow, John L.

It is one of Washington's most popular scenic attractions, but is perhaps best known internationally for its appearance in the cult television series Twin Peaks. More than 1.5 million visitors come to the Falls every year, where there is a two-acre (0.8 ha) park, an observation deck, and a gift shop. Most of the river is diverted into the power plants, but at times the river is high enough to flow across the entire precipice, which creates an almost blinding spray. High water occurs following a period of heavy rains or snow followed by warm rainy weather. This can occur during the rainy season which lasts from November through March. During high water, the falls take on a curtain form. For the Snoqualmie People, who have lived for centuries in the Snoqualmie Valley in western Washington, Snoqualmie Falls is central to their culture, beliefs, and spirituality. A traditional burial site, to the Snoqualmie, the falls are \\"the place where First Woman and First Man were created by Moon the Transformer\\" and \\"where prayers were carried up to the Creator by great mists that rise from the powerful flow.\\" The mists rising from the base of the waterfall are said to serve to connect Heaven and Earth. The falls were first nominated for the National Register of Historic Places in 1992 as a Traditional Cultural Property for its association with the beliefs of the Snoqualmie people. However, the property owner, Puget Sound Energy, objected to the listing. The falls were subsequently determined eligible for listing in the National Register. The owners rescinded their objection and on September 2, 2009, the falls were formally listed in the National Register. In October 2019, the Snoqualmie Indian Tribe purchased Snoqualmie Falls and the Salish Lodge as well as 45 acres of surrounding land for $125 million. History Ownership In 2007, the Muckleshoot tribe purchased the Salish Lodge and were transferred ownership on October 9, 2007. The Muckleshoot planned to build a hotel, conference center, and 175 homes above Snoqualmie Falls. Members of the Snoqualmie Indian Tribe opposed the project for its proximity to burial grounds and the Snoqualmie Falls. In 2015, the Snoqualmie Indian Tribe launched the \\"Save Snoqualmie Falls\\" campaign. In October 2018, the Muckleshoot received approval from the Snoqualmie City Council to develop a 182-room hotel, convention center, and up to 210 homes. On October 31, 2019, the Snoqualmie Indian Tribe closed on purchasing Snoqualmie Falls, the Salish Lodge and Spa, the Snoqualmie Falls Gift Shop, and 45 acres of property north of and across State Route 202. The tribe purchased it for $125 million, effectively halting the Muckleshoot's development plans. The Salish Lodge will, however, continue to be managed by the Seattle-based company Columbia Hospitality. The purchase was announced the following day on November 1, 2019. The tribe called its purchase a further effort to \\"reclaim its traditional lands\\" and \\"stop irresponsible development\\". Power plants Cutaway diagrams of Power Plant 1 The Snoqualmie Falls Hydroelectric Plant is at Snoqualmie Falls, currently operated by Puget Sound Energy. It is made of two power houses, Plant 1 and Plant 2. Plant 1 was built in 1899 and operates at the base of the falls embedded in the rock below the surface. It was the world's first completely underground power plant. Plant 2 was built in 1910 and further expanded in 1957, and is located a short distance downstream of the falls. Approximately 1% of Puget Sound Energy sales comes from the plant. The 1899 generating system was designated an ASCE Civil Engineering Landmark in 1981. Namesake town The town of Snoqualmie Falls was located near the waterfall. It was associated with the Weyerhaeuser mill there. It had many structures, including a hospital, a school, community center, and many homes. When the town disbanded, many houses were moved to the nearby town of Snoqualmie. The 1940s and '50s film actress Ella Raines was born in Snoqualmie Falls. Hiking The top of the waterfall is less than from the parking lot, which has a gift shop, espresso stand, and bathrooms. The main views are from the side of the falls, with a fence separating visitors from the edge of a cliff. This area has picnic tables and benches, and a small grassy meadow called the Centennial Green, where weddings are performed through the summer. Here, the river trail descends in half a mile (800 m), passing through temperate rain forest with moss covered Bigleaf Maple, Douglas-fir, Sword Fern and Salal and places to step off the trail and rest or enjoy the scenery. Heavy use makes wildlife sightings uncommon. The park does allow pets. At the bottom of the trail is the 1910 powerhouse, not open to visitors, and a view of the falls.

It was promoted as a Swiss national dish by the Swiss Cheese Union (Schweizerische Käseunion) in the 1930s, and was popularized in North America in the 1960s. Since the 1950s, the term \\"fondue\\" has been generalized to other dishes in which a food is dipped into a communal pot of liquid kept hot in a fondue pot: chocolate fondue, fondue au chocolat, in which pieces of fruit or pastry are dipped into a melted chocolate mixture, and fondue bourguignonne, in which pieces of meat are cooked in hot oil or broth. Etymology The word fondue is the feminine passive past participle of the French verb fondre (\\"to melt\\") used as a noun.Trésor de la langue française, s.v. fondue and fondre, etymology section B.3.a It is first attested in French in 1735, in Vincent la Chapelle's Cuisinier moderne,Vincent la Chapelle, Le cuisinier moderne p. 220 and in English in 1878.Oxford English Dictionary, Second edition, 1989; online version November 2010. s.v. History The earliest known recipe for the modern form of cheese fondue comes from a 1699 book published in Zurich, under the name \\"Käss mit Wein zu kochen\\", \\"to cook cheese with wine\\".Kochbuch der Anna Margaretha Gessner, 1699, cited by Albert Hauser, Vom Essen und Trinken im alten Zürich, cited by Isabelle Raboud-Schüle, \\"Comment la fondue vint aux Suisses\\", Annales fribourgeoises 72:101–112 (2010) It calls for grated or cut-up cheese to be melted with wine, and for bread to be dipped in it. However, the name \\"cheese fondue\\", until the late nineteenth century, referred to a dish composed of eggs and cheese, as in la Chapelle's 1735 Fonduë de Fromage, aux Truffes Fraiches; it was something between scrambled eggs with cheese and a cheese soufflé.Prosper Montagne, Larousse Gastronomique, 1938, p. 483, quoted in the Food Timeline FAQ Brillat-Savarin wrote in 1834 that it is \\"nothing other than scrambled eggs with cheese\\".\\"Ce n'est autre chose que des œufs brouillés au fromage\\", Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, Physiologie du goût, 1834, p.336-9 Variations included cream (\\"à la genevoise\\") and truffles (\\"à la piémontaise\\") in addition to eggs, as well as what is now called \\"raclette\\" (\\"fondue valaisanne\\").Joseph Favre, Dictionnaire universel de Cuisine, Paris 1894, cited by Raboud-Schüle, 2007 The first known recipe for the modern cheese fondue under that name, with cheese and wine but no eggs, was published in 1875, and was already presented as a Swiss national dish.Louis Favre, L'habitation--​le vêtement--​les aliments. Manuel d'économie domestique à l'usage des écoles secondaires et primaires supérieures, Neuchâtel 1875, cited by Raboud-Schüle, 2007 Despite its modern associations with rustic mountain life, it was a town-dweller's dish from the lowlands of western, French- speaking, Switzerland: rich cheese like Gruyère was a valuable export item which peasants could not afford to eat.Fabian Muhieddine, \\"La fondue: un coup marketing de 1930!\\", Le Matin.ch, reporting on a lecture by Isabelle Raboud- Schüle full textRaboud-Schüle, p. 4-5 The introduction of corn starch to Switzerland in 1905 made it easier to make a smooth and stable emulsion of the wine and cheese, and probably contributed to the success of fondue.Raboud- Schüle, p. 5 Fondue was popularized as a Swiss national dish by the Swiss Cheese Union (Schweizerische Käseunion) in the 1930s as a way of increasing cheese consumption. The Swiss Cheese Union also created pseudo-regional recipes as part of the \\"spiritual defence of Switzerland\\".Isabelle Raboud- Schüle, director of the Musée gruérien, interview \\"History of Cheese Fondue\\" National Public Radio, \\"The Fondue Conspiracy\\", Planet Money 575 (October 10, 2014) After World War II rationing ended, the Swiss Cheese Union continued its marketing campaign, sending fondue sets to military regiments and event organizers across Switzerland. Fondue is now a symbol of Swiss unity. In the meantime, fondue continued to be promoted aggressively in Switzerland, with slogans like \\"La fondue crée la bonne humeur\\" 'fondue creates a good mood' and (1981, in Swiss German) \\"Fondue isch guet und git e gueti Luune\\" 'fondue is good and creates a good mood' – abbreviated as \\"figugegl\\".Raboud-Schüle, p. 7 Fondue was promoted to Americans at the Swiss Pavilion's Alpine restaurant at the 1964 New York World's Fair.Lawrence R. Samuel, End of the Innocence: The 1964-1965 New York World's Fair, p. 153 Fondue was popular in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s, along with other foods made in chafing dishes.William Sitwell, A History of Food in 100 Recipes, 2013, , p. 273 The extension of the name \\"fondue\\" to other dishes served in a communal hot pot dates to 1950s New York. Konrad Egli, a Swiss restaurateur, introduced fondue bourguignonne at his Chalet Suisse restaurant in 1956. In the mid 1960s, he invented chocolate fondue as part of a promotion for Toblerone chocolate.Sylvia Lovegren, Fashionable Food: Seven Decades of Food Fads, pp. 240-2 A sort of chocolate mousse or chocolate cake had also sometimes been called \\"chocolate fondue\\" starting in the 1930s.Barry Popik, The Big Apple blog, \\"Chocolate Fondue (myth)\\" Preparation A full cheese fondue set in Switzerland. Apart from pieces of bread to dip into the melted cheese, there are side servings of kirsch, raw garlic, pickled gherkins, onions, and olives. Cheese fondue consists of a blend of cheeses, wine and seasoning. To prepare the caquelon it is first rubbed with a cut garlic clove. White wine is slightly heated with cornstarch, and then grated cheese is added and stirred until melted. It is often topped off with a bit of kirsch. The cornstarch or other starch stabilizes and thickens the mixture. Additional wine may be added if the fondue is too thick; its acid and ethanol decrease the fondue's viscosity. Temperature and la religieuse A cheese fondue mixture should be kept warm enough to keep the fondue smooth and liquid but not so hot that it burns. If this temperature is held until the fondue is finished there will be a thin crust of toasted (not burnt) cheese at the bottom of the caquelon. This is called la religieuse (French for the nun). It has the texture of a cracker and is almost always lifted out and eaten. Cheese fondues Swiss The regional names used for some of these variants are factitious, and do not reflect genuine regional traditions. * Vaudoise: Gruyère. * Fribourgeoise: Vacherin fribourgeois à fondue, wherein potatoes are often dipped instead of bread. This is the only cheese fondue that does not use wine. The cheese is melted in a few tablespoons of water over low heat.Heidi and Gerhold Albonico (1972) Schweizer Tafelfreuden Vol. 1, Silva-Verlag, Zürich (German) * Moitié-moitié (or half and half), also called Fondue Suisse: Gruyère and Fribourg vacherin. * Neuchâteloise: Gruyère and Emmental. * Innerschweiz: Gruyère, Emmental, and Sbrinz. * Genevoise: Gruyère (preferably of several stages of maturity) with a little Emmentaler and Valais cheese. Sometimes chopped sautéed morels are added. * Interlaken: Gruyère, Appenzeller, Emmental. * Appenzeller: Appenzeller cheese with cream added. * Tomato: Gruyère, Emmental, crushed tomatoes, and wine. * Spicy: Gruyère, red and green peppers, with chili. * Mushroom: Gruyère, Fribourg vacherin, and mushrooms. French * Savoyarde: Comté, Beaufort and one or two other local cheese like Reblochon, Abondance,French, http://www.750g.com/la-vraie- fondue-savoyarde-r82614.htm or French equivalent of Gruyère. * Jurassienne: Mature or mild Comté. * Auvergnate: Saint-Nectaire, Cantal and Fourme d'AmbertFrench, http://cuisine.aufeminin.com/forum/recette-de-la-fondue- auvergnate-fd3920035 Italian alpine * Valdôtaine (See 1 and 2. or ): Fontina, milk, and eggs, typical of the Aosta Valley; * Fonduta piemontese in Piedmont.  Prepared convenience food  Refrigerated fondue blends are sold in most Swiss supermarkets as convenience food and need little more than melting in the caquelon. Individual portions heatable in a microwave oven are also sold. Other fondues Fondue Chinoise Chocolate Fondue Fondue Bourguignonne Broth Fondue chinoise (lit. \\"Chinese fondue\\") is a common name for hot pot, where meat and vegetables are cooked in a shared pot of broth, or just dip the thinly sliced meat with a fondue fork into boiling broth with salad as side dish. Various sauces and pickled condiments are provided on the side. After all the diners have finished cooking, they eat the now well-flavored broth often combined with thin noodles. Chocolate Slices of fruit or pastry are dipped in a caquelon of melted chocolate, often flavored with rum or kirschwasser. Dessert fondues may also be made with coconut, honey, caramel, or marshmallow. Oil Fondue bourguignonne consists of a fondue pot filled with hot oil into which diners dip pieces of meat to cook them. Various dipping sauces are provided on the side. Wine \\"Fondue vigneronne\\" or \\"Fondue Bacchus\\" is like fondue bourguignonne, with wine rather than oil. Red wine fondue consists of red wine boiled, and seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic, onions and herbs; the white wine version is spiced with cinnamon, chilis, coriander, white pepper and enriched with chicken broth. The guests then dip meat, fish or vegetables in the caquelon and top them with bearnaise, tartar sauce or simply French mustard. Consumption and etiquette Fondue is eaten by spearing a piece of bread on a fork, swirling it in the pot, and putting it into the mouth.Fred Kemer, Fabulous Fondues: Appetizers, Main Courses, and Desserts, 2000, , p. 14 Some writers recommend that the dipping fork be used only to transport the food from the pot to one's plate, not to eat from.Ellen Brown, The Complete Idiot's Guide to Fondues and Hot Dips, p. 10 Losing a piece of bread in the caquelon is traditionally penalized by buying a round of drinks, singing a song, or running around in the snow naked. This is parodied in Asterix in Switzerland, where a character is sentenced to be drowned in Lake Geneva after losing his third piece of bread. There are various recommendations on the choice of accompanying beverage: some say white wine, others specify black tea. Some drink spirits during or after the meal, which supposedly helps digestion. Indeed, alcohol may provide short-term relief, but overall, it delays gastric emptying and prolongs perceived fullness. The delayed, strong feeling of fullness after eating fondue may be caused by phase separation in the stomach, the cheese fat initially floating in the stomach not released into the duodenum, delaying fat sensing and satiation.

Created by David Kaler and Steve Ditko, the character first appeared in Captain Atom v1 #82 (September 1966) originally published by Charlton Comics. Publication history Charlton Comics Nightshade was first introduced in Captain Atom #82, as a partner for the titular hero. Her real name is Eve Eden and her father is a U.S. senator. She is blonde and wears a black wig as Nightshade. She was romantically involved with Captain Atom for a brief time. She appeared several times in Captain Atom stories, before getting her own backup series in the last three published issues (#87-89). She also appeared in the last unpublished Captain Atom story that appeared in the fanzine Charlton Bullseye. In this backup series (with art by Jim Aparo), Tiger (Judomaster's now-grown-up sidekick) is her martial-arts instructor. The source of her powers is also finally described. Her mother, Magda, was actually a visitor from another dimension whose denizens have the ability to transform into living two-dimensional shadows; she passed these powers on to her son and daughter. On a visit to this dimension, Magda and her children are attacked. Mortally wounded, Magda is able to transport herself and Eve back to Earth. Eve promised to return and find her brother. This never occurs during the Charlton years. In 1981, Nightshade would appear in issue #7 of the new Charlton Bullseye comic. Her last \\"Charlton\\" appearance would be in a story that teamed up all the Charlton \\"Action Heroes\\" as the Sentinels of Justice, and in her own one-shot by AC Comics. DC Comics =Suicide Squad= Nightshade in Suicide Squad. Art by Luke McDonnell. Once integrated into the DC Universe in Crisis on Infinite Earths, Nightshade was revamped as a government super-spy who worked for Task Force X aka the Suicide Squad. Many of her adventures alongside Captain Atom during their Charlton interactions were retconned into instead being with King Faraday. While the Suicide Squad's core group was busy dealing with the events of the crossover Legends, Nightshade, along with fellow spy Nemesis, was sent overseas to infiltrate the mercenary death squad known as \\"Jihad\\". Taking the name Chimera, Nightshade was forced to participate in the massacre of innocent civilians at an airport as Jihad sought to demonstrate their effectiveness to a potential client. This event deeply affected Nightshade, causing tension between her and Suicide Squad leader Amanda Waller. As a result of the mission with Jihad, Nightshade was removed from her position as a spy and given the job of being the handler for the mentally unstable sorceress known as the Enchantress. She also served as Waller's liaison between Task Force X and a rival government program known as Project ATOM (which brought Nightshade into contact with the superhero Captain Atom). As the series progressed, Nightshade revealed her past to her team: her post-Crisis origin was that she was the princess of the \\"Land of Nightshades\\". Eve Eden's mother Maureen was the queen of the Land of Nightshades, and fled to Earth with her infant children to escape the demonic power of an entity known as the Incubus. Eve believed she was a normal child until her mother took her and her brother Larry into the Land of Nightshades, to show them their true heritage. This was a costly mistake. The Incubus found them, kidnapped Larry and mortally wounded Maureen. Eve's mother used her last breath to reveal to Eve her hereditary powers over darkness. Eve promised her dying mother that she would one day return to save her younger brother. The Incubus possessed Larry's body, killing him in the process, and hid within the Land of Nightshades slaughtering all remaining human inhabitants. It was revealed that when Nightshade (who post-Crisis now possessed the additional ability of teleportation) used her powers to teleport that the process required her to pass through the barren and haunted Land of Nightshades. Waller gave Nightshade permission to take the team for her personal mission in return for her help in taking down a drug cartel overseas. It was volunteer only, but everyone currently on the team agreed to go with the exception of Captain Boomerang. Bronze Tiger had to take him out, get him drunk, and drag him along unconscious. They entered the Land of Nightshades and discovered that Larry was dead and his body was controlled by the Incubus. It was revealed that June Moone's mysterious and evil \\"Enchantress\\" persona was in truth the entity known as the \\"Succubus\\". The two entities sought to possess Larry and Eve in order to force the siblings to conceive a child who would be the incarnation of their demonic master. Enchantress was stripped of her powers when the Succubus left her body to possess Nightshade. The evil entity failed to realize that Nightshade's will was stronger than her brother's, and was destroyed. Nightshade absorbed the Succubus' powers. With the Succubus defeated, Nightshade passively watched as her teammate Deadshot finished the mission, killing the Incubus by shooting the entity in the head. Nightshade was a permanent fixture in the Suicide Squad series, appearing throughout the series run. =After the Suicide Squad= When the Suicide Squad series came to an end, Nightshade was shown working for Sarge Steel at the CBI. She made several appearances in the Superboy and the Ravers comic and would also be part of the L.A.W. miniseries, which reunited all the Charlton Action Heroes owned by DC. During the Superman/Batman story arc \\"Public Enemies\\", she was for a brief time under the control of Gorilla Grodd, trying to capture Superman for a billion-dollar reward. This was part of a grouping of super- powered individuals, most villains, also brainwashed by Gorilla Grodd. The reward was set out by then-President Lex Luthor. The confrontations take place in Washington, D.C. Nightshade and the villains were ultimately defeated. =Day of Vengeance= Nightshade has since then resurfaced as a member of the Shadowpact in the Day of Vengeance miniseries. She has been paired with Detective Chimp, resulting in some good-natured bickering. During the Infinite Crisis crossover she joined a legion of DC's magic-based characters battling the Seven Deadly Sins. However, she was captured by Felix Faust and eventually used by Alex Luthor to bring back Earth-4. =Shadowpact= In Shadowpact #1, Nightshade and the other Shadowpact members entered the town of Riverrock, Wyoming, which was shielded from the outside world. She met a villainous counterpart named Sister Shadow. Since then she has served with the Shadowpact battling a host of magical villains. In Shadowpact #7 it was revealed that she requires some measure of concentration to form elaborate darkness constructs, when she and her partner Ragman were attacked by the Congregation. As a result, she was unable to conjure her more elaborate darkness creatures until Blue Devil managed to get the Congregation away from her. Despite this Nightshade and her teammates found themselves blinded by the Congregation's light power and for the first time in her life she experienced darkness. With the assistance of Madame Xanadu the Shadowpact set about restoring Nightshade's sight, although fully restoring it took several days. She is now capable of manifesting up to three giant humanoids at once.Shadowpact #11 (May 2007)Shadowpact #22 (April 2008) =\\"Blackest Night\\"= During the events of the \\"Blackest Night\\" storyline, Nightshade has apparently rejoined the Suicide Squad. The team is sent to Belle Reve in order to kidnap former Suicide Squad member Deadshot. Nightshade attacks several of Deadshot's teammates on the Secret Six, but is defeated by Black Alice after she steals Nightshade's powers and uses them to render her unconscious.Secret Six (vol. 3) #17 (March 2010) After a group of Black Lanterns composed of former Suicide Squad members arrives at Belle Reve to feast on the assembled metahumans, Amanda Waller knocks Black Alice out cold in order to give Nightshade back her abilities (something which Nightshade believes is too far, as Alice is just a kid). Her powers restored, Nightshade joins the combined Suicide Squad and Secret Six members in fighting off the Black Lanterns.Secret Six (vol. 3) #18 (April 2010) =Rise of Eclipso= Some time after the events of \\"Blackest Night\\", Nightshade is once again shown to be working with Shadowpact. While in another dimension, she and Nightmaster are attacked by Eclipso and his brainwashed servant, Shade. After defeating both heroes, Eclipso brings Nightshade under his mental control.Justice League of America (vol. 2) #54 (April 2011). DC Comics. =DC Rebirth= Nightshade in Deathstroke #33 In Blue Beetle, a retired-from-heroics Ted Kord references Nightshade by name, calling her \\"a comely young superheroine from back in my Beetle days\\".Blue Beetle (vol. 9) #01 (November 2016). DC Comics. In the \\"Batman Vs. Deathstroke\\" story arc of Deathstroke, Nightshade appears as an antagonist to Deathstroke, both seeking to recover a biological weapon. Nightshade sends a living shadow to attack Deathstroke and grab the box with the weapon on a memory key after he had extracted it from an ice wall. Deathstroke assumes that Amanda Waller has something to do with this, but Nightshade responds that both he and she herself aren't with the Suicide Squad anymore but are still tangled with US intelligence operations. As she attacks with her magic, she mentions that she is an orphan and the last of her line, Homo magi and the royal house of the Land of Nightshades. She can't transport Deathstroke to the Land of Nightshades, because the promethium in his equipment is capable of absorbing most types of energies including the Night Force. Instead, she uses her shadow-matter raven Hugin to transport Robin (Damian Wayne), who Deathstroke is working with begrudgingly, to the Land of Nightshades (where humans are driven insane as they're faced with their worst nightmares) to force Deathstroke to open the box and give the weapon inside to her, because she can't safely open it herself without setting off the explosives in the box. She states that the weapon is terrible and that she will destroy the weapon, even though that will go against her employer. After throwing the box to Robin, she also threatens Deathstroke that Robin might open the box and thereby set off the explosives during his insanity. Deathstroke says that they both know she won't let Robin die, but she responds that she used to know but a lot of has changed. After Deathstroke gets Robin out of this realm, he opens the box and hands over a corrupted duplicate that Robin has switched for the real one. She then flies away with the duplicate, while Robin refuses to hand over the actual weapon to Deathstroke.Deathstroke (vol. 4) #33 (July 2018). DC Comics. Later, Adeline Kane reveals to Batman, disguised as Deathstroke, that she had hired Nightshade to secure the biological weapon.Deathstroke #35 (2018). DC Comics. In \\"The Witching Hour\\" crossover story arc, she is seen during a Sisterhood of the Sleight Hand meeting at the Oblivion Bar where she rescues Traci 13 by pulling her into the shadow dimension, as Witchfire possessed by Hecate burns and thereby kills many of the people inside the bar.Wonder Woman and Justice League Dark: The Witching Hour #1 (December 2018). DC Comics. After escaping through the shadow dimension, alongside Traci 13 and Enchantress, Nightshade is seen using shadows to capture Manitou Dawn who is also possessed by Hecate.Wonder Woman #57 (December 2018). DC Comics. In the finale of the arc, she is seen alongside a few other heroes as they confront and defeat Hecate who was then possessing Wonder Woman.Justice League Dark and Wonder Woman: The Witching Hour #1 (December 2018). DC Comics. In Doomsday Clock, she appears alongside Blue Beetle, the Question, and Captain Atom in the Bug airship as they travel to Mars. There, they and many of Earth's other superheroes confront and fight Doctor Manhattan. In the battle, she fires blasts of shadows to him. All the superheroes are, however, defeated and incapacitated by Doctor Manhattan.Doomsday Clock #9 (2019). DC Comics. Powers and abilities Nightshade's powers are hereditary as the only surviving member of the royal family of the Land of Nightshades. She can teleport herself and others by passing them through the Land of Nightshades. She can magnify and shape shadows into solid or semi-solid forms. She is learning to create shadow homunculi and has created two ravens out of shadow- matter to serve as scouts for her; she has named them Hugin and Munin after the legendary ravens belonging to the Norse deity Odin. Nightshade absorbed the Succubus into her body after the Suicide Squad mission on which Larry died, and doing so made her appear less human: her skin turned white and her hair became living shadows. She is now the only person capable of accessing the haunted dimension known as the Land of Nightshades. Other versions *Earth-Two: An enemy of the Golden Age Sandman (Wesley Dodds), this Nightshade had the ability to control plants. Upon his revival in the 1980s series All- Star Squadron, he was renamed \\"Ramulus\\" to avoid confusion with the Eve Eden character and became a member of the Monster Society of Evil. *Earth-4: In the final issue of 52, a new Multiverse is revealed, originally consisting of 52 realities. Among the parallel realities shown is one designated \\"Earth-4\\". As a result of Mister Mind \\"eating\\" aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre-Crisis Earth-4, including Nightshade and the other Charlton characters. The names of the characters are not mentioned in the panel in which they appear. Based on comments by Grant Morrison, this alternate universe is not the pre-Crisis Earth-4. *Earth-13: Shown in Countdown: Arena and known as Eve of the Shadows. Dressed in a gypsy attire, she is married to the Captain Atom of her world, the Brigadier Atom. Upon avenging her namesake, and slaying The Shade, she travels the Shadowlands dimension to get back home, finding Monarch waiting for her, holding her husband by the throat. He nukes her world's version of the United States and Canada and brings Eve back badly traumatized. *Countdown: Arena: A female version of The Shade. This version of Nightshade, a sadistic psychopath, creates horrible creatures with her powers that torn one of the other two Nightshades, until she is taken to the Shadowlands by Eve of Shadows and has her head ripped off. *The Flash: Two male characters were named Nightshade in The Flash television series. The first, Dr. Desmond Powell (played by Jason Bernard) was a hero from the 1950s, while the second was a violent antihero/villain who believed he was emulating the first (the second is also known as the Deadly Nightshade), Curtis Bohannan (played by Richard Burgi). *JLA: Destiny: Nightshade appeared as a prominent character and later changed her name to Destiny after she received the ability to see in the future. *Kingdom Come (Earth-22): Nightshade was briefly shown in flashbacks as a member of Magog's Justice Battalion, along with the rest of the Charlton 'Action Heroes'. She was apparently killed with the other members when Captain Atom was killed. *Watchmen: the female superhero character (Silk Spectre) was originally supposed to be Nightshade. However, once the idea of using Charlton characters was abandoned, writer Alan Moore decided to take inspiration from other superheroines.Cooke, Jon B. \\"Alan Moore discusses the Charlton-Watchmen Connection\\". Comic Book Artist #9 In other media Television * In an unproduced proposal for a JLA cartoon, Nightshade was one of several characters redesigned by Bruce Timm. Unlike the other proposed characters in the concept art, which included Vixen, Lightray, Doctor Fate and Supergirl, Nightshade would not appear in the eventually realised Justice League or Justice League Unlimited. Film Nightshade briefly appears in Superman/Batman: Public Enemies, voiced by Rachael MacFarlane. After she first attacks Superman, Batman notices her speech pattern and deduces that she is being controlled by Gorilla Grodd, subsequently knocking her unconscious with a batarang filled with knockout gas.

It remained largely unchanged through its production. Kawasaki used inverted forks starting in 1991, added ram air using a single tube, and in 1996, twin tube ram air and Tokico six piston brakes and fully adjustable suspension. From 1989 through 1995 in the US market, Kawasaki called the ZXR-750 and ZXR-750R the ZX-7 and ZX-7R respectively. Starting from 1996 Kawasaki dropped the ZXR name worldwide and the former ZXR-750 was now ZX-7R and the limited edition homologation special ZXR-750R/ZX-7R started in 1991 was now ZX-7RR. Overview The ZX-7R has a 749 cc in-line four-cylinder, four-stroke engine. The frame used on the ZX-7R is a lightweight aluminum twin-spar item, designed using computer-aided design to optimize strength. The rear subframe was constructed using steel, providing enough strength for a pillion passenger. The swingarm used largely the same fabrication techniques to produce a hollow cast and pressed aluminum alloy hybrid swingarm, and the Uni-Trak rear suspension system features a predominantly lightweight alloy and aluminum construction. The Uni-Trak system was designed to provide a progressively stiffer damping and spring rate under compression. The rear suspension unit is fully adjustable in terms of damping, preload and compression. The front suspension found on the ZX-7R comprises a fully adjustable 8-way compression and 12-way rebound 43 mm inverted cartridge fork. Front brakes are 320 mm semi-floating front discs and Tokico six-piston calipers. Rear brakes feature a 230 mm disc with a twin-piston opposed caliper. The ZX-7RR differs from the road model with an adjustable head-stock angle, swing arm pivot, additional increased adjustability 28-way compression and 13-way rebound to the front and 14-way rebound for the rear suspension, ten more than the R model, a solo cowl with a different aluminum subframe, and 41 mm flat-slide carburetors versus the 38mm on the base R model. It also has a close ratio gear-box fitted as standard and a crankshaft flywheel that is heavier and Nissin front brake calipers. Cycle World recorded a time of 10.82 seconds at . Racing The ZX-7RR was raced, winning 12 AMA superbike championships. Kawasaki's Road Racing team riders were Eric Bostrom, Doug Chandler and Scott Russell. Doug Toland won the 1993 Endurance FIM World Championship. Andreas Hofmann won the 1997 Macau Grand Prix.

The Swedish language dominates commercial and cultural life in Sweden but did not officially become the country's main language until 2009, when a new language law entered into effect. The need for this legal status had been the subject of protracted debate and proposed legislation was narrowly defeated in 2005.Svenskan blir inte officiellt språk , Sveriges Television, 2005-12-07. Retrieved on July 23, 2006. (in Swedish) The minority languages have been legally recognized to protect the cultural and historical heritage of their respective speech communities.Hult, F.M. (2004). Planning for multilingualism and minority language rights in Sweden. Language Policy, 3(2), 181-201. These communities are given certain rights on that basis, such as school education in their language, and its use in dealing with governmental agencies.  Criteria for inclusion  These are the criteria established by the Minority Language Committee, influenced by the directives from the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in 1997. To be accorded official minority status, a language must have been spoken in Sweden for a significant amount of time. A precise figure has not been revealed, but qualified estimations consider 100 years to be reasonable, based on the included and excluded languages. A significant immigration to Sweden did not start until after World War I, and many languages currently spoken by a large number of people in Sweden are excluded, among them Arabic and Persian. It is also required that the language be spoken by a significant number of people and be centred in a specific geographical region (the latter, however, not applied for Romani and Yiddish). Furthermore, it is a condition that the granting of official minority language status should be of cultural benefit to the group speaking it. It is allegedly for this reason that Swedish Sign Language was not included - even though it is a unique language with a history dating back to the 18th century, it was considered to have a sufficiently stable basis already in Swedish culture. Common culture is yet another criterion for inclusion.  Affected languages   Finnish  Finnish has been spoken in Sweden ever since the (then provincial) borders were drawn in the 13th century. Sweden has always had a significant migration to and from Finland. As the two languages belong to different language families it is easy to distinguish them, unlike the neighbouring languages Norwegian and Danish. The number of Finnish speakers in Sweden today has been estimated to over 460,000. Even though many current Swedes are of full or mixed Finnish descent, Swedish is the main language in practice for many bilinguals. Finnish and Meänkieli can be used in the northernmost municipalities of Gällivare, Haparanda, Kiruna, Pajala and Övertorneå and its immediate neighbourhood. On 11 December, 2007, Finnish Broadcasting Company YLE reported, that in Uppsala, Sweden, speaking Finnish was forbidden from municipal employees, and that this was the case also with small talk during breaks. According to an agreement between the city council and the municipal trade union the official working language is Swedish and two employees were not allowed to speak Finnish with one another in the common work premises or in break rooms. The Equality Ombudsman considered that a ban was permissible in that particular case.Stockholm County Board, Från erkännande till egenmakt, från ord till handling. Rapport från konferens om den minoritetspolitiska reformen. May 2010  Meänkieli  Meänkieli (also known as Tornionlaaksonsuomi [lit. Tornedalian Finnish] and Tornedalian) is spoken by a population in northern Sweden. It is closely related to and mutually intelligible with Finnish and sometimes considered a dialect thereof, with many loanwords from Swedish. Especially in Finland the distinction of Meänkieli as a separate language is seen as language politics not based in linguistics (see Kven language for a similar situation in Norway). The number of speakers in Sweden amounts to 30,000.  Saami languages  The Saami languages are actually not one language, even though they are commonly referred to as such. In Sweden, five Saami languages are spoken. The history of the Saami languages can be traced back at least 2,000 years. In total, they are spoken by a minimum of 40,000 people throughout the four countries of Sweden, Norway, Finland and Russia. As a minority language, Saami is an official language and may be used in government agencies, courts, preschools and nursing homes in the municipalities where it is most common.  Romani  Romani chib, the language of Romani people, has been spoken in Sweden since the 16th century. Today about 9,500 people speak it in Sweden. It does not have a geographical center, but is considered to be of historical importance.  Yiddish  Yiddish has been a common language of Ashkenazi (Central and Eastern European) Jews since early in their history. The first Jews were permitted to reside in Sweden during the late 18th century. As of 2009, the Jewish population in Sweden was estimated at around 20,000. Out of these 2,000–6,000 claim to have at least some knowledge of Yiddish according to various reports and surveys. The number of native speakers among these has been estimated by linguist Mikael Parkvall to be 750–1,500. It is believed that virtually all native speakers of Yiddish in Sweden today are adults, and most of them elderly.Mikael Parkvall, Sveriges språk. Vem talar vad och var?. RAPPLING 1. Rapporter från Institutionen för lingvistik vid Stockholms universitet. 2009, pp. 68–72 The organization Sveriges Jiddischförbund (Yiddish Association of Sweden) has been the national parent organization for Yiddish speakers and has four local chapters in Borås, Gothenburg, Stockholm and Malmö. It has been active since 1976 and was previously known as Sällskapet för jiddisch och jiddischkultur i Sverige (The Society for Yiddish and Yiddish Culture in Sweden) which is now the name of the chapter based in Stockholm.Sveriges Jiddischförbund, Detta är Jiddischförbundet.

Such people are termed linguistic minorities or language minorities. With a total number of 196 sovereign states recognized internationally (as of 2019)ONU members and an estimated number of roughly 5,000 to 7,000 languages spoken worldwide, the vast majority of languages are minority languages in every country in which they are spoken. Some minority languages are simultaneously also official languages, such as Irish in Ireland or the numerous indigenous languages of Bolivia. Likewise, some national languages are often considered minority languages, insofar as they are the national language of a stateless nation. Law and international politics Europe Source: the list of signatories at the Council of Europe website. ;Definition For the purposes of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages: :\\"regional or minority languages\\" means languages that are: #traditionally used within a given territory of a State by nationals of that State who form a group numerically smaller than the rest of the State's population; and #different from the official language(s) of that State. In most European countries, the minority languages are defined by legislation or constitutional documents and afforded some form of official support. In 1992, the Council of Europe adopted the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages to protect and promote historical regional and minority languages in Europe.Hult, F.M. (2004). \\"Planning for multilingualism and minority language rights in Sweden\\", Language Policy, 3(2), 181–201. The signatories that have not yet ratified it as of 2012 are Azerbaijan, France, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Macedonia, Malta, Moldova, and Russia. Canada In Canada the term \\"minority language\\" is used in the Constitution of Canada, in the heading above section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which guarantees educational rights to official language minority communities. In Canada, the term \\"minority language\\" is generally understood to mean whichever of the official languages is less spoken in a particular province or territory (i.e., English in Québec, French elsewhere). Politics Minority languages may be marginalised within nations for a number of reasons. These include having a relatively small number of speakers, a decline in the number of speakers, and popular belief that these speakers are uncultured, or primitive, or the minority language is a dialect of the dominant language. Support for minority languages is sometimes viewed as supporting separatism, for example, the ongoing revival of the Celtic languages in the British Isles (Irish, Welsh, Scottish Gaelic, Manx, Cornish and Breton). The dominant culture may consider use of immigrant minority languages to be a threat to unity, indicating that such communities are not integrating into the larger culture. Both of these perceived threats are based on the notion of the exclusion of the majority language speakers. Often this is added to by political systems by not providing support (such as education and policing) in these languages. Speakers of majority languages can and do learn minority languages, through the large number of courses available. It is not known whether most students of minority languages are members of the minority community re-connecting with the community's language, or others seeking to become familiar with it. Controversy Views differ as to whether the protection of official languages by a state representing the majority speakers violates the human rights of minority speakers. In March 2013, Rita Izsák, UN Independent Expert on minority issues, said that \\"protection of linguistic minority rights is a human rights obligation and an essential component of good governance, efforts to prevent tensions and conflict, and the construction of equal and politically and socially stable societies\\". In Slovakia for example, the Hungarian community generally considers the 'language law' enacted in 1995 to be discriminatory and inconsistent with the European Charter for the Protection of Regional or Minority languages. The Majority Slovaks believed that minority speakers' rights are guaranteed, in accordance with the highest European standards, and are not discriminated against by the state language having preferential status. The language law declares that \\"the Slovak language enjoys a preferential status over other languages spoken on the territory of the Slovak Republic.\\" As a result of a 2009 amendment, a fine of up to €5,000 may be imposed for a misdemeanor from the regulations protecting the preferential status of the state language, e.g. if the name of a shop or a business is indicated on a sign-board first in the minority language and only after it in Slovak, or if in a bilingual text, the minority language part is written with bigger fonts than its Slovak equivalent, or if the bilingual text on a monument is translated from the minority language to the dominant language and not vice versa, or if a civil servant or doctor communicates with a minority speaker citizen in a minority language in a local community where the proportion of the minority speakers is less than 20%. Sign languages are often not recognized as true natural languages, although extensive research supports the case that they are independent languages. Speakers of auxiliary languages have also struggled for their recognition. They are used primarily as second languages and have few native speakers. Languages lacking recognition in some countries These are languages that have the status of a national language and are spoken by the majority population in at least one country, but lack recognition in other countries, even where there is a significant minority linguistic community: *Albanian – recognized minority language in many countries, including Romania, but not recognized as a minority language in Greece, where 4% of the population are ethnic Albanians and Kosovo where 97% of the population are Albanians. *Bulgarian – recognized minority language in the Czech Republic (4,300 speakers), but not officially recognized as minority language in Greece. *German: classified as an official language in Germany, Austria, Luxembourg, Belgium and Switzerland, but as a minority elsewhere in Europe. It is recognised in South Tyrol, but not in France. *Hungarian: official in Hungary, and co-official in Serbia's Vojvodina province (293,000 speakers). It is a recognised minority language in the Czech Republic (14,000 speakers), and in Romania (1,447,544 speakers, 6.7% of the population), in those communities where the Hungarian speakers exceed 20% of the population; in Slovakia (520,000 speakers, approximately 10% of the population); and in Ukraine (170,000 speakers). *Macedonian – Macedonian is not recognized as minority language in Greece and Bulgaria. *Polish – recognized minority language in the Czech Republic (51,000 speakers), but it is not officially recognized as a minority language in Lithuania. *Romanian: official in Romania and co-official in Vojvodina province, Serbia, with (30,000 speakers), but it does not have official status in Serbia, where another 5300 speakers live outside this province.http://media.popis2011.stat.rs/2011/prvi_rezultati.pdf Serbian Preliminary 2011 Census Results Note: Ethnologue estimates 250,000 Romanian speakers in Serbia. It is a minority language in northwestern Bulgaria (estimated 10,566 speakers); and in Ukraine (estimated 450,000 speakers). *Russian: official in Russia, and co-official in Belarus and Kazakhstan. It lacks official status in Estonia and Latvia, likely for historical reasons following Russian dominance during the Soviet Union era. (More than 25% of the population in the latter two nations are Russian speakers). *Serbian: official in Serbia, and co-official in Bosnia and Herzegovina . It has minority status in Montenegro,Kosovo, Croatia, Macedonia, Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic, and Romania. The minority status in Montenegro is controversial because the majority of the population (63.49%) declared Serbian to be their mother tongue. Serbian was an official language there until 2007, when Montenegro ratified a new constitution. Significant languages having no majority of speakers in any country Linguistic communities that form no majority of population in any country, but whose language has the status of an official language in at least one country: *Tamil: 78 million speakers; official status in India, Sri Lanka, and Singapore *Berber: 45 million speakers; official status in Morocco, Algeria, and Libya *Kurdish: 22 million speakers; official status in Iraq *Afrikaans: 13 million first or second language speakers (16 million speakers with basic knowledge), official status in South Africa, recognized regional language in Namibia *Catalan: 9 million speakers, official status in Andorra, regional official status in Catalonia, the Valencian Community under the name of Valencian, and the Balearic Islands, Spain. Recognized regional language in Italy, and specifically on the island of Sardinia in Alghero. It has no official status in Northern Catalonia, or France. *Dutch Low Saxon: 4.8 million speakers, a minority language in the Netherlands, and in Germany. *Galician: 3–4 million speakers, regional official status in Galicia, Spain. *Limburgish: 2 million speakers, a minority language in Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. *Welsh: 622,000 speakers, regional official status in Wales, UK; minority in Chubut, Argentina, with no legal recognition. *Basque: 665,800 speakers, regional official status in the Basque Country (autonomous community) and Navarre in Spain. It has no official status in the Northern Basque Country in France. *Frisian languages: 400,000 speakers, regional official language in Netherlands, Denmark and Germany. *Irish: 291,470 native speakers (1.66 million with some knowledge), official status in Ireland and an officially recognised minority language in the United Kingdom. *Māori: 157,110 speakers; official status in New Zealand *Romansh: 60,000 speakers, official status in Switzerland (Graubünden). *Cherokee: 22,500 speakers; official status within the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, a sovereign nation *Scottish Gaelic: 87,000 people with some ability, 57,375 of which are first and second language speakers. Regional status in Scotland, UK. 300 native speakers, 2,320 overall in Canada, minority status. About 1,900-speaker minority in the United States. *Sardinian: 1,350,000 native (first or second language) speakers, more with some knowledge, regional official status in Sardinia *Corsican: 125,000 native (first or second language) speakers; regional co-official status in Corsica Languages with no official status Lawsuits * Alexander v.

Association of Parents Treasure Language A treasure language is one of the thousands of small languages still spoken in the world today. The term was proposed by the Rama people of Nicaragua as an alternative to heritage language, indigenous language, and \\"ethnic language\\", names that are considered pejorative in the local context.

The fortification, also referred to as el Morro or 'the promontory,' was designed to guard the entrance to the San Juan Bay, and defend the Spanish colonial port city of San Juan from seaborne enemies. In 1983, the citadel was declared a World Heritage Site by the United Nations in conjunction with the San Juan National Historic Site. Over two million visitors a year explore the castillo, making it one of Puerto Rico's leading tourist attractions. Facing the structure, on the opposite side of the bay, a smaller fortification known as El Cañuelo complemented the castillo's defense of the entrance to the bay.  Structure for deployment  HABS San Juan, Puerto Rico field office El Morro in 1591 The construction of the citadel and its surrounding walls began in 1539 on orders of King Charles V of Spain. The original fortress was built under the direction of conquistador Diego Ramos de Orozco and its main purpose was to defend the port of San Juan by controlling the entry to its harbor. In order to have a viable defense while the rest of the fort was being completed, a small proto-fortress was erected during the first year of construction. It is estimated that this section comprises about 10% of the whole structure. It was not till 1587, however, that Field Marshal Juan de Tejeda and the Italian engineer-architect Juan Bautista Antonelli drew the fort's final design. The plan, which was based on the then firmly established Spanish military fortification principles of the time, included fortifying nine other sites in the Spanish Main and Spanish West Indies: Santo Domingo, Santa Marta, Cartagena, Nombre de Dios, Portobelo, the Chagres River, Panama City, Havana, and St. Augustine. San Juan construction began in March 1589 with skilled artisans, 12 stonecutters, 18 masons, 2 smiths, a cooper, metal founder, and an overseer assigned to the task, with the help 150 slaves. Captain General Diego Menéndez de Valdés took over construction after Tejeda and Antonelli left to start construction of Santo Domingo's fortifications. Capt. Pedro de Salazar took over construction in 1591. View of El Morro's entrance The new fortifications consisted of a hornwork, crossing the headland, to protect the landward side of the existing tower and water battery. Two half-bastions, one on the Atlantic side called \\"Tejeda\\", and another on the harbor side called \\"Austria\\", were connected by a curtain wall fronted by a moat, and spanned by a drawbridge in the center. The gate and drawbridge were protected by a ravelin, and just inside the gate was a guardhouse. A pair of batteries behind the hornwork overlooked the sea and harbor. In 1634, construction of the city walls surrounding San Juan began. By 1650, the town was enclosed on the east, south and west, while natural battlements protected the city along the Atlantic. In 1765, Alejandro O'Reilly, Inspector General of Cuba, and Colonel Tomás O'Daly, San Juan Chief of Engineers, agreed on a plan to strengthen San Juan's defenses, which was approved by Charles III of Spain. San Juan became a Defense of the First Order, and one of the most powerful plazas in the Americas by 1790. El Morro's improvements included 3 cisterns under the main plaza containing 216,000 gallons of water collected from times of rain. The walls were strengthened to be 18–40 feet thick. These walls consisted of limestone and sandstone blocks forming the exterior and interior, with rubble sandwiched in between. The Santa Bárbara battery became the main battery with 37 cannon, supported by casemate guns at a lower level, and backed by a great wall with casemates at a higher level. The top of the Castillo de San Felipe del Morro Lighthouse was destroyed during the 1898 bombardment of the city by the United States, and the American flag replaced the Spanish on 18 November 1898.  History   Spanish Rule (1539–1898)  El Morro Upon the advice of Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés, a battery was constructed on the rocky promontory called \\"the Morro\\", when the location of La Fortaleza was deemed unsuitable. This battery consisted of a tower with 4 embrasures, and a Water Battery at the foot of the slope for 3 guns. By 1555, Morro had 8 bronze cannons, as a defense against French privateers. During the Spanish government of the island, El Morro, also known as Castillo de San Felipe, survived several attacks from foreign powers on various occasions. In 1593 Portuguese soldiers, sent from Lisbon by order of Phillip II, composed the first garrison of the San Felipe del Morro fortress in Puerto Rico. Some brought their wives, while others married Puerto Rican women, and today there are many Puerto Rican families with Portuguese last names. In 1595, Englishman Sir Francis Drake unsuccessfully attacked San Juan with his fleet in the Battle of San Juan (1595). In 1598, the English attacked again, led by George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland. Clifford succeeded because he attacked San Juan over land instead of trying to enter through the San Juan Bay. However, an epidemic of dysentery forced him to flee the island after the Battle of San Juan (1598). In 1625, the Dutch, led by Boudewijn Hendricksz, also attacked the island emulating George Clifford's overland invasion. To the amazement of the citizens, the invaders were able to pass in front of the castle's defenders and into the harbor, out of reach of the city's cannons. El Morro managed to resist the siege and eventually made the Dutch retire, although the attackers were able to sack and burn the city before leaving the Battle of San Juan (1625). In 1797, British General Ralph Abercromby and Admiral Henry Harvey, with a force of 7,000–13,000 men, invaded the island of Puerto Rico. Captain General Don Ramón de Castro and his forces repelled the attack. Abercromby and Harvey were defeated in the Battle of San Juan (1797). El Morro's last active fight occurred during a naval bombardment by the United States Navy during the 1898 Spanish–American War, ending the age of naval warfare in the Caribbean, at least in the classical sense. During the Spanish–American War, the castle was attacked at least three times by American naval forces, the largest being the Bombardment of San Juan on May 12, 1898. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris, in which Spain ceded ownership of the islands of Puerto Rico, Cuba, Guam, and the Philippines to the United States.  American military occupation (1898–1961)  Modification to the Spaniard fortification by US military during WW2El Morro and many other Spanish government buildings in Old San Juan became part of a large U.S. Army post, called Fort Brooke. In the early 20th century, the U.S. military filled up the esplanade (the green space in front of \\"El Morro\\") with baseball diamonds, hospitals, officers' quarters, an officers' club and even a golf course. On March 21, 1915, Lt. Teófilo Marxuach was the officer of the day at the El Morro fortress. The Odenwald (built in 1903 and not to be confused with the German World War II warship of the same name) was an armed German supply ship which tried to force its way out of the bay and deliver supplies to the German submarines waiting in the Atlantic Ocean. Lt. Marxuach gave the order to open fire on the ship, which was forced to return; its supplies were confiscated.CALLS ODENWALD AFFAIR AN ATTACK, The New York Times, April 7, 1915 The shots ordered by Lt. Marxuach are widely regarded to be the first shots fired by the United States in World War I, although the first actual wartime shot fired by the U.S. came on the day war was declared, during the scuttling of the SMS Cormoran off Guam. During World War II the United States Army added a massive concrete bunker to the top of El Morro to serve as a Harbor Defense Fire Control Station to direct a network of coastal artillery sites, and to keep watch for German submarines which were ravaging shipping in the Caribbean. A lighthouse, rebuilt by the U.S. Army in 1906–08 is the tallest point on El Morro, standing 180 feet (55 m) above sea level. Flagpoles on El Morro today customarily fly the United States flag, the Puerto Rican flag and the Cross of Burgundy flag, also known in Spanish as las Aspas de Borgoña, a standard which was widely used by Spanish armies around the world from 1506 to 1785.  National Park (1961–present)  Panorama view of the city from the castle In 1961, the United States Army officially retired from El Morro. The fort became a part of the National Park Service to be preserved as museums. In 1983, the Castillo and the city walls were declared a World Heritage Site by the United Nations. In honor of the Quincentennial of the voyages of Columbus in 1992 the exterior esplanade was cleared of palm trees that had been planted by the U.S. Army in the Fort Brooke era, and restored to the open appearance this \\"field-of-fire\\" for El Morro's cannon would have had in colonial Spanish times. Parking lots and paved roads were also removed, and the El Morro lighthouse repaired and restored to its original appearance. El Morro was used as a film set in the 1996 motion picture Amistad. Steven Spielberg used it to represent a fort in Sierra Leone where African slaves were auctioned in 1839. African slave labor was used in addition to local labor to help build the castillo. El Morro was a defensive military fortification and a major component of San Juan's harbor defense system. Puerto Rico as such was considered by the Spanish crown as the \\"Key to the Antilles\\"; no enemy ship could navigate its waters without fear of capture. An annual artisans festival is held at the fort every July.

Taylor Square is located beside a major road junction, where Oxford Street meets Flinders Street. Taylor Square is also on the border of the suburbs of Darlinghurst and Surry Hills. Description Taylor Square sits above the tunnel section of the Eastern Distributor, part of M1. The square is named after Sir Allen Taylor (1864-1940), a timber merchant, ship builder and Lord Mayor of Sydney who was responsible for the widening of Oxford Street during his tenure. The area formerly bound by the traffic of the three streets is popularly known as \\"Gilligan's Island\\" because of three large palm trees that once occupied the strip, but have since been subsequently removed. Construction of the Eastern Distributor also entailed the realignment of traffic flow in the area. Direct vehicle access across Oxford Street via Bourke Street is no longer possible. The locality is a centre of the city's nightlife, especially for its LGBT community. Two permanent tributes are the large rainbow flag and rainbow crossing, built in 2014 and 2019 respectively. The original temporary rainbow crossing on Oxford St (April 2013) Darlinghurst Courthouse is an imposing sandstone building on Taylor Square. It was designed by architect Mortimer Lewis (1796 - 1879) in 1844, and has a Greek Revival style facade. The central block is adapted from an 1823 design in Peter Nicholson's The New Practical Builder.Apperly, Irving & Reynolds, 1989. The square also features a large water fountain built into the pavement. This was part of a $5.25 million upgrade, in 2003, including lighting and grass terrace. The fountain is currently being reviewed for upgrade and repair by City of Sydney Council.

Publication history The original version first appeared in Uncanny X-Men #199 (November 1985) and was created by Chris Claremont and John Romita Jr. Freedom Force was a supervillain team, though they occasionally acted in a heroic capacity as well. It was a government- sponsored team originally composed mainly of Mystique's version of Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. They mostly interacted with the X-Men, X-Factor and New Mutants, but also repeatedly met the Avengers. The second team first appeared in Avengers: The Initiative #12 (June 2007) and were created by Dan Slott, Christos N. Gage, and Steve Uy. It was set up as Montana's Fifty State Initiative superteam. Fictional team biography Mystique's Freedom Force When mutant and human relationships worsen, the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants's leader Mystique decides that it has become too dangerous for them to continue their current path. She offers the group's services to Valerie Cooper, a United States National Security Advisor, in exchange for full pardons. Cooper sees a great opportunity in Mystique's offer, but wants the team to prove their loyalty first by arresting the original group's founder Magneto. The team accepts, and is renamed \\"Freedom Force\\" with the sorceress Spiral added to the team. They attack Magneto at a remembrance ceremony for the Holocaust. Though they meet a decisive defeat at the hands of Magneto's new allies, the X-Men, Magneto decides to surrender himself to Freedom Force.Uncanny X-Men #199 (November 1985) On their next mission, Spider-Woman is added to the team's line-up. When the Avengers are framed by their embittered former member Quicksilver, the U.S. government sends Freedom Force to arrest the Avengers, which they do successfully. Spider-Woman feels guilty for these actions, frees the Avengers from jail, and leaves Freedom Force, becoming a fugitive. Another three members are added: Crimson Commando, Stonewall and Super Sabre, all World War II veterans who decided to take justice in their own hands and hunt down and execute criminals. When they targeted Storm, they were defeated and turned themselves in. It was thought that the former heroes could be redeemed and they were offered a position on Freedom Force. Over the next few months, they are given many unpopular tasks, such as enforcing the Mutant Registration Act, arresting the outlaw X-Men, and saving the people of Dallas from an attack by an evil god. Freedom Force clashes with X-Factor and the New Mutants when they learn that Freedom Force is helping the U.S. government forcibly recruit young mutants and potential mutants for training and eventual government service.New Mutants #78 (August 1989) During this time, Spiral leaves the team for her own reasons. Freedom Force also helps train Captain America and assists in apprehending the mutant terrorists Resistants.Captain America #346 (October 1988) Freedom Force also participates in other missions of a more general nature, including the rescue of Senator Robert Kelly from a South American drug syndicate that had kidnapped during a diplomatic visit,Marvel Comics Presents #41 (January 1990) as well as helping to contain a jailbreak at Truman Marsh's Vault.Avengers: Deathtrap, the Vault (July 1991) The team begin to fall apart after the mutant Forge asks them to protect Muir Island against the Reavers. During this mission, Stonewall and Destiny are killed, and Avalanche is severely injured. The death of Destiny especially hits Mystique hard and the team fights the Avengers without her leadership. Shortly after the battle at Muir Island, Cooper is possessed by the Shadow King and ordered to kill Mystique, however, Cooper resists the Shadow King's influence and seriously injures herself rather than commit murder. Mystique then assumes Val's identity, passing Cooper's injured body as her own corpse, and later aids the X-Men and X-Factor as a \\"mole\\" among the Shadow King's servants. Without Mystique, the remaining Freedom Force members are sent on a disastrous mission in Kuwait during the first Gulf War, in which Super Sabre is killed and Crimson Commando severely injured. To save Crimson Commando's life, Avalanche leaves Pyro and Blob stranded in enemy territory. Avalanche and Crimson Commando, now a cyborg, continue to work for the US government, apparently as covert operations agents. The team is soon replaced by the government team X-Factor, also under Val Cooper's supervision. Initiative Freedom Force After the superhuman \\"Civil War\\", registered superheroes were teamed up and assigned to a state. Montana's Fifty State Initiative team is Freedom Force. This Freedom Force team consists of Cloud 9, Think Tank, Equinox and Spinner, led by the Golden Age hero Challenger.Avengers: The Initiative #12 During the Secret Invasion storyline, Equinox was revealed to be a Skrull infiltrator who is killed by Cloud 9.Avengers: The Initiative #18 Spinner dies soon after while trying to destroy a Skrull weapon system.Avengers: The Initiative #19 During the Dark Reign storyline, new Initiative leader Norman Osborn orders Freedom Force to attack the Heavy Hitters after they secede from the Initiative.

It was built by the Spanish to protect against land based attacks on the city of San Juan. It is part of San Juan National Historic Site. Castillo San Cristóbal is the largest fortification built by the Spanish in the New World. When it was finished in 1783, it covered about 27 acres of land and partly encircled the city of San Juan. Entry to the city was sealed by San Cristóbal's double gates. After close to a hundred years of relative peace in the area, part of the fortification (about a third) was demolished in 1897 to help ease the flow of traffic in and out of the walled city. This fortress was built on a hill originally known as the Cerro de la Horca or the Cerro del Quemadero, changed to Cerro de San Cristóbal in celebration of the Spanish victories ejecting English and Dutch interlopers from the island of this name in the Lesser Antilles. At the time, it hen formed part of the insular territorial glacis of Puerto Rico. Castillo de San Cristóbal also contains five cisterns that were used for the storage of water during the ages of the Spanish Colony. They are extremely large (24 ft tall, 17 ft wide and 57 ft long) and were used as bomb shelters during World War II.

The first battle resulted in a Spanish victory, but the exhausted Spanish troops couldn't impede the English entry into San Juan. On 18 June Cumberland with his forces advanced and then swept into San Juan's streets meeting little resistance; he found that some of the citizenry had already fled.[5] The government officials and other residents had taken refuge in El Morro and 250 Spanish soldiers are ensconced within the Morro Citadel. Soon after the town had been occupied, the English had artillery ferried ashore from their fleet and a formal siege was instituted.[5] Two days later the siege was under way and El Morro was bombarded from both land and sea while in the meantime Cumberland set about sacking the town. Knowing that the Spanish were short of supplies, the English preferred to lay siege to the castle of El Morro rather than destroy it.[8] After nearly 16 days huddled inside El Morro, short of food and ammunition and being constantly bombarded, the Spanish governor Antonio Mosquera requested terms on 30 June for a surrender. Cumberland refused this request and set his own terms for the Spanish surrender of which Mosquera eventually agreed to.[9] He and his followers were repatriated to Cartagena several weeks later.[5] The victory had cost Cumberland nearly 60 casualties; however, as the same dysentery that had crippled much of the Spanish it had then spread to Cumberland's men, incapacitating nearly 600 - 700 of them as well as which included forty accidents.[10][11] With barely enough troops to crew his ships, much less maintain control of the prize he had seized from Spain, Cumberland finally decided to leave the island. Before he left however he ordered the sacking of San Juan and then ordered the destruction of the crops. His troops stole the organ and bells from the cathedral and took booty ranging from 2,000 slaves to a marble windowsill that caught his eye.[11] Cumberland sailed for England with some ships on 14 August, then on 23 September Berkeley followed with his main body along with around 70 artillery pieces from the fort.[12] Clifford on his return to England was proclaimed as a hero of sorts and as a consequence with his limited booty was well rewarded for his efforts including a patent from the Queen.

Cisterns were to be used as fallout shelters. 1949 – San Juan National Historic Site is established as the most impressive structure in the new world. 1961 – The US Army moves out of the forts of Old San Juan, and they become the jurisdiction of the United States National Park Service, to be preserved solely as museums. 1983 – San Juan National Historic Site is declared a World Heritage Site by the United Nations. La Garita del Diablo Guerite Most of San Juan's fortified walls have guerites (sentry boxes, \\"garitas\\" to the locals) at various points. One of the guerites at Castillo San Cristóbal is called \\"The Devil's Guerite\\" (\\"La Garita del Diablo\\"). This guerites offer a vantage point to watchmen guarding the sea shore, while protecting them. This particular guerite is one of the oldest parts of the fort being built in 1634. There are several legends surrounding the guerite. Some of them say that soldiers disappeared randomly from the guerite. However, it is mostly believed – and told so in various local stories – that the only soldier that apparently disappeared was a soldier called Sánchez, who fled his post to escape with his girlfriend, called Dina. However, the legend still surrounds the guerite. Although, it is currently inaccessible to the general public, it can be seen from the upper part of the fort.

Symptoms include trouble breathing through the nose, loss of smell, decreased taste, post nasal drip, and a runny nose. The growths are sac-like, movable, and nontender, though face pain may occasionally occur. They typically occur in both nostrils in those who are affected. Complications may include sinusitis and broadening of the nose. The exact cause is unclear. They may be related to chronic inflammation of the lining of the sinuses. They occur more commonly among people who have allergies, cystic fibrosis, aspirin sensitivity, or certain infections. The polyp itself represents an overgrowth of the mucous membranes. Diagnosis may occur by looking up the nose. A CT scan may be used to determine the number of polyps and help plan surgery. Treatment is typically with steroids, often in the form of a nasal spray. If this is not effective, surgery may be considered. The condition often recurs following surgery; thus, continued use of a steroid nasal spray is often recommended. Antihistamines may help with symptoms but do not change the underlying disease. Antibiotics are not required for treatment unless an infection occurs. About 4% of people currently have nasal polyps while up to 40% of people develop them at some point in their life. They most often occur after the age of 20 and are more frequent in males than females. Nasal polyps have been described since the time of the Ancient Egyptians. Signs and symptoms Symptoms of polyps include nasal congestion, sinusitis, loss of smell, thick nasal discharge, facial pressure, nasal speech, and mouth breathing. Recurrent sinusitis can result from polyps. Long-term, nasal polyps can cause destruction of the nasal bones and widening of the nose. As polyps grow larger, they eventually prolapse into the nasal cavity resulting in symptoms. The most prominent symptoms of nasal polyps is blockage of the nasal passage.People with nasal polyps due to aspirin intolerance often have symptoms known as Samter's triad, which consists of asthma worse with aspirin, a skin rash caused by aspirin, and chronic nasal polyps. Causes The exact cause of nasal polyps is unclear. They are, however, commonly associated with conditions that cause long term inflammation of the sinuses. This includes chronic rhinosinusitis, asthma, aspirin sensitivity, and cystic fibrosis. Various additional diseases associated with polyp formation include: Chronic rhinosinusitis is a common medical condition characterized by symptoms of sinus inflammation lasting at least 12 weeks. The cause is unknown and the role of microorganisms remains unclear. It can be classified as either with or without nasal polyposis. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common cause of nasal polyps in children. Therefore, any child under 12 to 20 years old with nasal polyps should be tested for CF. Half of people with CF will experience extensive polyps leading to nasal obstruction and requiring aggressive management. Paranasal sinuses: 1. frontal sinuses, 2. ethmoid sinuses (ethmoidal air cells), 3. sphenoid sinuses, 4. maxillary sinuses Pathophysiology The true cause of nasal polyps is unknown, but they are thought to be due to recurrent infection or inflammation. Polyps arise from the lining of the sinuses. Nasal mucosa, particularly in the region of middle meatus becomes swollen due to collection of extracellular fluid. This extracellular fluid collection causes polyp formation and protrusion into the nasal cavity or sinuses. Polyps which are sessile in the beginning become pedunculated due to gravity. In people with nasal polyps due to aspirin or NSAID sensitivity, the underlying mechanism is due to disorders in the metabolism of arachidonic acid. Exposure to cycloxygenase inhibitors such as aspirin and NSAIDs leads to shunting of products through the lipoxygenase pathway leading to an increased production of products that cause inflammation. In the airway, these inflammatory products lead to symptoms of asthma such as wheezing as well as nasal polyp formation. Diagnosis Large choanal polyp seen with nasal endoscopy Nasal polyps can be seen on physical examination inside of the nose and are often detected during the evaluation of symptoms. On examination, a polyp will appear as a visible mass in the nostril. Some polyps may be seen with anterior rhinoscopy (looking in the nose with a nasal speculum and a light), but frequently, they are farther back in the nose and must be seen by nasal endoscopy. Nasal endoscopy involves passing a small, rigid camera with a light source into the nose. An image is projected onto a screen in the office so the doctor can examine the nasal passages and sinuses in greater detail. The procedure is not generally painful, but the person can be given a spray decongestant and local anesthetic to minimize discomfort. Attempts have been made to develop scoring systems to determine the severity of nasal polyps. Proposed staging systems take into account the extent of polyps seen on endoscopic exam and the number of sinuses affected on CT imaging. This staging system is only partially validated, but in the future, may be useful for communicating the severity of disease, assessing treatment response, and planning treatment. Types There are two primary types of nasal polyps: ethmoidal and antrochoanal. Ethmoidal polyps arise from the ethmoid sinuses and extend through the middle meatus into the nasal cavity. Antrochoanal polyps usually arise in the maxillary sinus and extend into the nasopharynx and represent only 4–6% of all nasal polyps. However, antrochoanal polyps are more common in children comprising one-third of all polyps in this population. Ethmoidal polyps are usually smaller and multiple while antrochoanal polyps are usually single and larger. CT scan CT scan can show the full extent of the polyp, which may not be fully appreciated with physical examination alone. Imaging is also required for planning surgical treatment. On a CT scan, a nasal polyp generally has an attenuation of 10–18 Hounsfield units, which is similar to that of mucus. Nasal polyps may have calcification. Histology Histology of nasal polyp, magnification 25x (H&E; stain) On histologic examination, nasal polyps consist of hyperplastic edematous (excess fluid) connective tissue with some seromucous glands and cells representing inflammation (mostly neutrophils and eosinophils). Polyps have virtually no neurons. Therefore, the tissue that makes up the polyp does not have any tissue sensation and the polyp itself will not be painful. In early stages, the surface of the nasal polyp is covered by normal respiratory epithelium, but later it undergoes metaplastic change to squamous type epithelium with the constant irritation and inflammation. The submucosa shows large intercellular spaces filled with serous fluid. Differential diagnosis Other disorders can mimic the appearance of nasal polyps and should be considered if a mass is seen on exam. Examples include encephalocele, glioma, inverted papilloma, and cancer. Early biopsy is recommended for unilateral nasal polyps to rule out more serious conditions such as cancer, inverted papilloma, or fungal sinusitis. Treatment The first line of treatment for nasal polyps is topical steroids. Steroids decrease the inflammation of the sinus mucosa to decrease the size of the polyps and improve symptoms. Topical preparations are preferred in the form of a nasal spray but are often ineffective for people with many polyps. Steroids by mouth often provide drastic symptom relief, but should not be taken for long periods of time due to their side effects. Because steroids only shrink the size and swelling of the polyp, people often have recurrence of symptoms once the steroids are stopped. Decongestants do not shrink the polyps, but can decrease swelling and provide some relief. Antibiotics are only recommended if the person has a co-occurring bacterial infection. In people with nasal polyps caused by aspirin or NSAIDs, avoidance of these medications will help with symptoms. Aspirin desensitization has also been shown to be beneficial. Surgery Endoscopic sinus surgery with removal of polyps is often very effective for most people providing rapid symptom relief. Endoscopic sinus surgery is minimally-invasive and is done entirely through the nostril with the help of a camera. Surgery should be considered for those with complete nasal obstruction, uncontrolled runny nose, nasal deformity caused by polyps or continued symptoms despite medical management. Surgery serves to remove the polyps as well as the surrounding inflamed mucosa, open obstructed nasal passages, and clear the sinuses. This not only removes the obstruction caused by the polyps themselves, but allows medications such as saline irrigations and topical steroids to become more effective. Surgery lasts approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour and can be done under general or local anesthesia. Most people tolerate the surgery without much pain, though this can vary from person to person. The person should expect some discomfort, congestion, and drainage from the nose in the first few days after surgery, but this should be mild. Complications from endoscopic sinus surgery are rare, but can include bleeding and damage to other structures in the area including the eye or brain. Many physicians recommend a course of oral steroids prior to surgery to reduce mucosal inflammation, decrease bleeding during surgery, and help with visualization of the polyps. Nasal steroid sprays should be used preventatively after surgery to delay or prevent recurrence. People often have recurrence of polyps even following surgery. Therefore, continued follow up with a combination of medical and surgical management is preferred for the treatment of nasal polyps.  Epidemiology  Nasal polyps resulting from chronic rhinosinusitis affect approximately 4.3% of the population. Nasal polyps occur more frequently in men than women and are more common as people get older, increasing drastically after the age of 40. Of people with chronic rhinosinusitis, 10% to 54% also have allergies. An estimated 40% to 80% of people with sensitivity to aspirin will develop nasal polyposis. In people with cystic fibrosis, nasal polyps are noted in 37% to 48%.

The grey ring inside its cup is a permanent magnet. This particular motor is an outrunner, with the stator inside the rotor. DC brushless ducted fan. The two coils on the printed circuit board interact with six round permanent magnets in the fan assembly. A brushless DC electric motor (BLDC motor or BL motor), also known as electronically commutated motor (ECM or EC motor) and synchronous DC motors, are synchronous motors powered by direct current (DC) electricity via an inverter or switching power supply which produces electricity in the form of alternating current (AC) to drive each phase of the motor via a closed loop controller. The controller provides pulses of current to the motor windings that control the speed and torque of the motor. This control system replaces the commutator (brushes) used in many conventional electric motors. The construction of a brushless motor system is typically similar to a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM), but can also be a switched reluctance motor, or an induction (asynchronous) motor. They may also use neodymium magnets and be outrunners (the stator is surrounded by the rotor), inrunners (the rotor is surrounded by the stator), or axial (the rotor and stator are flat and parallel).Control differences between ac induction motor and brushless dc motor? – Electrical Engineering Stack Exchange.

The advantages of a brushless motor over brushed motors are high power-to-weight ratio, high speed, electronic control, and low maintenance. Brushless motors find applications in such places as computer peripherals (disk drives, printers), hand-held power tools, and vehicles ranging from model aircraft to automobiles. In modern washing machines, brushless DC motors have allowed replacement of rubber belts and gearboxes with a much simpler and more reliable direct-drive design. Background Brushed DC motors were invented in the 19th century and are still common. Brushless DC motors were made possible by the development of solid state electronics in the 1960s.T.G. Wilson, P.H. Trickey, \\"D.C. Machine. With Solid State Commutation\\", AIEE paper I. CP62-1372, October 7, 1962 An electric motor develops torque by keeping the magnetic fields of the rotor, the rotating part of the machine, and the stator, the fixed part of the machine, misaligned. One or both sets of magnets are electromagnets, made of a coil of wire wound around an iron core. DC running through the wire winding creates the magnetic field, providing the power which runs the motor. The misalignment generates a torque that tries to realign the fields. As the rotor moves, and the fields come into alignment, it is necessary to move either the rotor's or stator's field to maintain the misalignment and continue to generate torque and movement. The device that moves the fields based on the position of the rotor is called a commutator.  Brush commutator  In brushed motors this is done with a rotary switch on the motor's shaft called a commutator. It consists of a rotating cylinder divided into multiple metal contact segments on the rotor. The segments are connected to conductor windings on the rotor. Two or more stationary contacts called brushes, made of a soft conductor like graphite, press against the commutator, making sliding electrical contact with successive segments as the rotor turns. The brushes selectively provide electric current to the windings. As the rotor rotates the commutator selects different windings and the direction current is applied to a given winding such that the rotor's magnetic field remains misaligned with the stator and creates a torque in one direction.  Disadvantages of commutator  The commutator has many engineering disadvantages that has led to the decline in use of brushed motors. These disadvantages are: *The friction of the brushes sliding along the rotating commutator segments causes power losses that can be significant in a low power motor. *The soft brush material wears down due to friction, creating dust, and eventually the brushes must be replaced. This makes commutated motors unsuitable for low particulate or sealed applications like hard disk motors, and for applications that require maintenance-free operation. *The resistance of the sliding brush contact causes a voltage drop in the motor circuit called which consumes energy. *The repeated abrupt switching of the current through the inductance of the windings causes sparks at the commutator contacts, which is a fire hazard in explosive atmospheres, a source of degrading UV radiation, and a source of electronic noise, which can cause electromagnetic interference in nearby microelectronic circuits. During the last hundred years high power DC brushed motors, once the mainstay of industry, were replaced by alternating current (AC) synchronous motors. Today brushed motors are only used in low power applications or where only DC is available, but the above drawbacks limit their use even in these applications. Brushless motors were invented to solve these problems.  Brushless solution  The development of semiconductor electronics in the 1970s allowed the commutator to be eliminated in DC motors, and also the brushes in permanent magnet motors. In brushless DC motors, an electronic servo system replaces the mechanical commutator contacts. An electronic sensor detects the angle of the rotor, and controls semiconductor switches such as transistors which switch current through the windings, either reversing the direction of the current or in some motors turning it off, at the correct time each 180° shaft rotation so the electromagnets create torque in one direction. The elimination of the sliding contact allows brushless motors to have less friction and longer life; their working life is only limited by the lifetime of their bearings. Brushed DC motors develop a maximum torque when stationary, linearly decreasing as velocity increases. Some limitations of brushed motors can be overcome by brushless motors; they include higher efficiency and lower susceptibility to mechanical wear. These benefits come at the cost of potentially less rugged, more complex, and more expensive control electronics. A typical brushless motor has permanent magnets that rotate around a fixed armature, eliminating problems associated with connecting current to the moving armature. An electronic controller replaces the brush/commutator assembly of the brushed DC motor, which continually switches the phase to the windings to keep the motor turning. The controller performs similar timed power distribution by using a solid-state circuit rather than the brush/commutator system. Brushless motors offer several advantages over brushed DC motors, including high torque to weight ratio, more torque per watt (increased efficiency), increased reliability, reduced noise, longer lifetime (no brush and commutator erosion), elimination of ionizing sparks from the commutator, and an overall reduction of electromagnetic interference (EMI). With no windings on the rotor, they are not subjected to centrifugal forces, and because the windings are supported by the housing, they can be cooled by conduction, requiring no airflow inside the motor for cooling. This in turn means that the motor's internals can be entirely enclosed and protected from dirt or other foreign matter. Brushless motor commutation can be implemented in software using a microcontroller or microprocessor computer, or may alternatively be implemented using analog or digital circuits. Commutation with electronics instead of brushes allows for greater flexibility and capabilities not available with brushed DC motors, including speed limiting, \\"micro stepped\\" operation for slow and fine motion control, and a holding torque when stationary. Controller software can be customized to the specific motor being used in the application, resulting in greater commutation efficiency. The maximum power that can be applied to a brushless motor is limited almost exclusively by heat; too much heat weakens the magnets and will damage the windings' insulation. When converting electricity into mechanical power, brushless motors are more efficient than brushed motors. This improvement is largely due to the frequency at which the electricity is switched determined by the position sensor feedback. Additional gains are due to the absence of brushes, which reduces mechanical energy loss due to friction. The enhanced efficiency is greatest in the no-load and low- load region of the motor's performance curve. Under high mechanical loads, brushless motors and high-quality brushed motors are comparable in efficiency. Environments and requirements in which manufacturers use brushless-type DC motors include maintenance-free operation, high speeds, and operation where sparking is hazardous (i.e. explosive environments) or could affect electronically sensitive equipment. The construction of a brushless motor resembles a stepper motor, but the motors have important differences due to differences in implementation and operation. While stepper motor are frequently stopped with the rotor in a defined angular position, a brushless motor is usually intended to produce continuous rotation. Both motor types may have but generally do not include a rotor position sensor for internal feedback. As a step motor, a well designed brushless motor can hold finite torque at zero rpm. Controller implementations Because the controller implements the traditional brushes' functionality it needs the rotor's orientation/position (relative to the stator coils). This is automatic in a brushed motor due to the fixed geometry of the rotor shaft and brushes. Some designs use Hall effect sensors or a rotary encoder to directly measure the rotor's position. Others measure the back-EMF in the undriven coils to infer the rotor position, eliminating the need for separate Hall effect sensors, and therefore are often called sensorless controllers. A typical controller contains three bidirectional outputs (i.e., frequency-controlled three-phase output), which are controlled by a logic circuit. Simple controllers employ comparators to determine when the output phase should be advanced, while more advanced controllers employ a microcontroller to manage acceleration, control speed and fine-tune efficiency. Controllers that sense rotor position based on back-EMF have extra challenges in initiating motion because no back-EMF is produced when the rotor is stationary. This is usually accomplished by beginning rotation from an arbitrary phase, and then skipping to the correct phase if it is found to be wrong. This can cause the motor to run briefly backwards, adding even more complexity to the startup sequence. Other sensorless controllers are capable of measuring winding saturation caused by the position of the magnets to infer the rotor position. Two key performance parameters of brushless DC motors are the motor constants K_T (torque constant) and K_e (back-EMF constant also known as speed constant K_V = {1 \\\\over K_e}).Brushless Motor Kv Constant Explained.

(This image does not illustrate the motor's inductive and generator-like properties) Brushless motors can be constructed in several different physical configurations: In the 'conventional' (also known as inrunner) configuration, the permanent magnets are part of the rotor. Three stator windings surround the rotor. In the outrunner (or external-rotor) configuration, the radial-relationship between the coils and magnets is reversed; the stator coils form the center (core) of the motor, while the permanent magnets spin within an overhanging rotor which surrounds the core. The flat or axial flux type, used where there are space or shape limitations, uses stator and rotor plates, mounted face to face. Outrunners typically have more poles, set up in triplets to maintain the three groups of windings, and have a higher torque at low RPMs. In all brushless motors, the coils are stationary. There are two common electrical winding configurations; the delta configuration connects three windings to each other (series circuits) in a triangle-like circuit, and power is applied at each of the connections. The Wye (Y-shaped) configuration, sometimes called a star winding, connects all of the windings to a central point (parallel circuits) and power is applied to the remaining end of each winding. A motor with windings in delta configuration gives low torque at low speed but can give higher top speed. Wye configuration gives high torque at low speed, but not as high top speed. Although efficiency is greatly affected by the motor's construction, the Wye winding is normally more efficient. In delta-connected windings, half voltage is applied across the windings adjacent to the driven lead (compared to the winding directly between the driven leads), increasing resistive losses. In addition, windings can allow high-frequency parasitic electrical currents to circulate entirely within the motor. A Wye-connected winding does not contain a closed loop in which parasitic currents can flow, preventing such losses. From a controller standpoint, the two styles of windings are treated exactly the same.  Applications  fan; the rotor has been removed. Brushless motors fulfill many functions originally performed by brushed DC motors, but cost and control complexity prevents brushless motors from replacing brushed motors completely in the lowest-cost areas. Nevertheless, brushless motors have come to dominate many applications, particularly devices such as computer hard drives and CD/DVD players. Small cooling fans in electronic equipment are powered exclusively by brushless motors. They can be found in cordless power tools where the increased efficiency of the motor leads to longer periods of use before the battery needs to be charged. Low speed, low power brushless motors are used in direct- drive turntables for gramophone records. Transport Brushless motors are found in electric vehicles, hybrid vehicles and personal transporters. Most electric bicycles use brushless motors that are sometimes built into the wheel hub itself, with the stator fixed solidly to the axle and the magnets attached to and rotating with the wheel. The same principle is applied in self- balancing scooter wheels. Most electrically powered RC models use brushless motors because of their high efficiency. Cordless tools Brushless motors are found in many modern cordless tools, including some string trimmers, leaf blowers, saws (circular or reciprocating), and drills/drivers. The advantages of brushless over brushed motors (low weight, high efficiency) are more important to handheld, battery-powered tools than to large, stationary tools plugged into an AC outlet, so uptake has been faster in that segment of the market. Heating and ventilation There is a trend in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) and refrigeration industries to use brushless motors instead of various types of AC motors. The most significant reason to switch to a brushless motor is the dramatic reduction in power required to operate them versus a typical AC motor.ECMs and HVAC Systems. Thomasnet.com. Retrieved on 2019-12-26. While shaded-pole and permanent split capacitor motors once dominated as the motor of fans, many fans are now run using a brushless motor. Some fans also use brushless motors in order to increase overall system efficiency. In addition to the brushless motor's higher efficiency, HVAC systems (especially those featuring variable-speed and/or load modulation) use brushless motors because the built-in microprocessor allows for programmability, control over airflow, and serial communication. Some ceiling fan and portable fans also feature this motor. They advertise the motor being highly energy efficient and quieter than most fans. Industrial engineering The application of brushless DC motors within industrial engineering primarily focuses on manufacturing engineering or industrial automation design. In manufacturing, brushless motors are primarily used for motion control, positioning or actuation systems. Brushless motors are ideally suited for manufacturing applications because of their high power density, good speed-torque characteristics, high efficiency, wide speed ranges and low maintenance. The most common uses of brushless DC motors in industrial engineering are linear motors, servomotors, actuators for industrial robots, extruder drive motors and feed drives for CNC machine tools. =Motion control systems= Brushless motors are commonly used as pump, fan and spindle drives in adjustable or variable speed applications as they are capable of developing high torque with good speed response. In addition, they can be easily automated for remote control. Due to their construction, they have good thermal characteristics and high energy efficiency.Ohio Electric Motors. DC Motor Protection. Ohio Electric Motors. 2011. To obtain a variable speed response, brushless motors operate in an electromechanical system that includes an electronic motor controller and a rotor position feedback sensor. Brushless DC motors are widely used as servomotors for machine tool servo drives. Servomotors are used for mechanical displacement, positioning or precision motion control. DC stepper motors can also be used as servomotors; however, since they are operated with open loop control, they typically exhibit torque pulsations. Brushless DC motors are more suitable as servomotors since their precise motion is based upon a closed loop control system that provides tightly controlled and stable operation. =Positioning and actuation systems= Brushless motors are used in industrial positioning and actuation applications. For assembly robots, brushless stepper or servo motors are used to position a part for assembly or a tool for a manufacturing process, such as welding or painting. Brushless motors can also be used to drive linear actuators. Motors that directly produce linear motion are called linear motors. The advantage of linear motors is that they can produce linear motion without the need of a transmission system, such as ballscrews, leadscrew, rack-and-pinion, cam, gears or belts, that would be necessary for rotary motors. Transmission systems are known to introduce less responsiveness and reduced accuracy. Direct drive, brushless DC linear motors consist of a slotted stator with magnetic teeth and a moving actuator, which has permanent magnets and coil windings. To obtain linear motion, a motor controller excites the coil windings in the actuator causing an interaction of the magnetic fields resulting in linear motion. Tubular linear motors are another form of linear motor design operated in a similar way. Aeromodelling external rotor motor weighs 5 g and consumes approximately 11 W. Brushless motors have become a popular motor choice for model aircraft including helicopters and drones. Their favorable power-to- weight ratios and wide range of available sizes, from under 5 grams to large motors rated at well into the kilowatt output range, have revolutionized the market for electric-powered model flight, displacing virtually all brushed electric motors, except for low powered inexpensive often toy grade aircraft. They have also encouraged growth of simple, lightweight electric model aircraft, rather than the previous internal combustion engines powering larger and heavier models. The increased power-to-weight ratio of modern batteries and brushless motors allows models to ascend vertically, rather than climb gradually. The low noise and lack of mass compared to small glow fuel internal combustion engines is another reason for their popularity. Legal restrictions for the use of combustion engine driven model aircraft in some countries, most often due to potential for noise pollution—even with purpose-designed mufflers for almost all model engines being available over the most recent decades—have also supported the shift to high-power electric systems. Radio-controlled cars Their popularity has also risen in the radio-controlled (RC) car area. Brushless motors have been legal in North American RC car racing in accordance to Radio Operated Auto Racing (ROAR) since 2006. These motors provide a great amount of power to RC racers and, if paired with appropriate gearing and high- discharge lithium polymer (Li-Po) or lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries, these cars can achieve speeds over . The maker's product specifications indicate the usage of a \\"Traxxas Big Block brushless motor\\" Brushless motors are capable of producing more torque and have a faster peak rotational speed compared to nitro- or gasoline-powered engines.

Historically, smithsonite was identified with hemimorphite before it was realized that they were two different minerals. The two minerals are very similar in appearance and the term calamine has been used for both, leading to some confusion. The distinct mineral smithsonite was named in 1832 by François Sulpice Beudant in honor of English chemist and mineralogist James Smithson (c.1765–1829), whose bequest established the Smithsonian Institution and who first identified the mineral in 1802. Smithsonite is a variably colored trigonal mineral which only rarely is found in well formed crystals. The typical habit is as earthy botryoidal masses. It has a Mohs hardness of 4.5 and a specific gravity of 4.4 to 4.5. Smithsonite occurs as a secondary mineral in the weathering or oxidation zone of zinc- bearing ore deposits. It sometimes occurs as replacement bodies in carbonate rocks and as such may constitute zinc ore. It commonly occurs in association with hemimorphite, willemite, hydrozincite, cerussite, malachite, azurite, aurichalcite and anglesite. It forms two limited solid solution series, with substitution of manganese leading to rhodochrosite, and with iron, leading to siderite.

From 1963 to 1968, he studied hydrobiology and fishery science in Hamburg. He wrote his doctoral thesis in 1969 on mass rearing of larval herring and his habilitation thesis in 1981 on closed-circuit systems in fish farming and research. From 1989 to 2002, he was a professor at the Institut für Meereskunde (Institute for Marine Sciences) of Kiel University. Rosenthal research focused on two areas:but # Aquaculture: Here, he concentrated on applied research on the one hand, particularly on closed-circuit fish farms, and ecological aspects on the other, in particular control and prevention of pollution, and sustainability especially in developing countries. # Ballast water: Rosenthal was one of the first to recognize and research the danger posed to ecosystems by the transport of marine life across huge distances in the ballast water of ships. He lobbied for regulations and other measures to combat this danger. In addition to his own research, Rosenthal plays an important role in the international collaboration of hydrobiologists and aquaculturists, in particular between Canada and Germany as well as Israel and Germany.

Overview Born in Stockholm in 1927, Jan Myrdal is the son of two of Sweden's most influential 20th century intellectuals, Nobel Laureates Alva Myrdal and Gunnar Myrdal, and the brother of Sissela Bok and Kaj Fölster. He was married to Gun Kessle (1926-2007), a graphic artist, photographer, and writer, until her death in 2007. She illustrated many of his works. As a child, Myrdal followed his parents to the United States during the Second World War, and would later, in several books, relate the importance that his time in New York had in shaping his intellectual evolution. As a youth and young adult, he dropped out of high school to focus on writing and politics, and married twice. He eventually settled on what he refers to in later autobiographical works as \\"the big life\\" with his third wife, Kessle: traveling widely in the Third World and dedicating himself to his intellectual pursuits and the role of an engaged public intellectual. He lived for a time in Afghanistan, Iran, and India, pioneered Swedish anti-colonial politics, and wrote of his experiences in developing societies that sought to liberate themselves from Western influences and pressures. An orthodox pro-Soviet Communist in his youth, Myrdal had by the late 1950s turned into an early proponent of a Maoist-style Communism infused with ideas of Third World solidarity. He became a stalwart defender of Mao Tse-tung's Chinese government and grew increasingly critical of the post-Stalin Soviet Union; several of his works were banned in the Eastern Bloc. Both in its Stalinist and in its Maoist variety, Myrdal's radical Communism added to the already severe tension within the Myrdal family, as both his parents were leading figures within Sweden's ruling Social Democrat party. His ties with Alva and Gunnar would eventually be severed completely, dividing and scandalizing what had long been perceived as a \\"model family\\" in social-democratic Sweden. Myrdal went on to pen unflattering portraits of his parents in several autobiographical books, while acknowledging their importance as intellectuals. Jan Myrdal speaking at a demonstration against the Vietnam War at Medborgarplatsen in Stockholm, 1966. Myrdal's major literary breakthrough was Report from a Chinese Village (1963), a semi-anthropological study of a village in Mao's China. In subsequent years, he would pen similar studies, drawing on material gathered during travel across the Third World. In the mid and late 1960s, he also emerged as a highly influential figure within the new Swedish left, which went on the attack against a long-hegemonic Social Democracy and took up positions to the left of the Moscow-backed Swedish Communist Party, which had begun to moderate its stance and, in 1967, changed its name to the Left Party Communists. From 1968 to 1973, Myrdal headed the Swedish-Chinese Friendship Association. From 1971 to 1972 and again from 1987 to 1989, he was the publisher and chairman of the board of Folket i Bild/Kulturfront (FiB/K), a magazine \\"for freedom of speech and of the press; for a people's culture and anti-imperialism,\\" which, in 1973, broke the IB affair scandal. For the most part, however, Myrdal's influence was of a more indirect nature, as the intellectual lodestar of a variety of small Maoist groups drawn from the university milieus – in particular the KFML, a small group whose role within the intellectual left vastly outstripped its numerical weight. For example, Maoists managed to gain control over a large and culturally influential Swedish pro-Vietnam movement, which protested the U.S. war in that country. Both through these groups and as an independent figure, Myrdal came to play a major role in the anti-war movement, when it was at its peak in terms of political and cultural influence. He later played a similar role in mobilizing a smaller but nonetheless energetic movement to oppose the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. After the 1970s, Myrdal's influence and popularity gradually declined and it began to be seriously circumscribed from the early 1990s. His uncompromising positions now drew more scrutiny and criticism after many of his former supporters renounced their earlier support of totalitarian politics. In contrast, Myrdal made no concessions to the new intellectual climate. Instead, he doubled down on his earlier views. His defense of Pol Pot's government and his denial of the Cambodian genocide became emblematic of his rigid Marxism- Leninism, which no longer had much purchase in Swedish public life.Svenska Dagbladet 19 July 2007, editorial blog: 80 år att minnasPeter Fröberg Idling: Pol Pots Lächeln.

Even after the decline of his political influence and visibility in day-to-day debates, Myrdal has remained an important figure in Swedish literature. A bibliophile and an unusually prolific and eclectic writer, he has published numerous books and articles on a diverse range of subjects. His newspaper and magazine columns are regularly collected in volumes published as Skriftställningar – a word that means, roughly, \\"writings,\\" and recalls Myrdal's own favored title, \\"skriftställare\\" (rather than \\"författare,\\" author). Outside politics, Myrdal's most influential works are the so-called I novels (\\"jagböcker\\"), a series of writings that present a highly personal, probing, and mostly autobiographical type of research into Myrdal's own life, upbringing, intellectual influences, and personal relationships. Initially best known for the controversy triggered by Myrdal's devastating portrayal of Alva and Gunnar's parenthood – some other members of the family accused him of lying – their literary value was immediately recognized. Appreciation for the quality of Myrdal's I novels has grown over time, even as his hardline politics have deepened his isolation and deprived him of opportunities to publish politically in mainstream outlets. Following Kessle's death in 2007, Myrdal remarried Andrea Gaytan Vega in 2008/2009. They split in 2011, then reconciled, and again divorced in 2018. Gaytan Vega was Myrdal's fourth wife, after Kessle (1963-2007), Maj Lidberg (1952-1956), and Nadja Wiking (1948-1952). He had two children, Janken Myrdal (with Wiking) and Eva Myrdal (with Lidberg).http://collections.smvk.se/carlotta-em/web/object/1021712 As a matter of public record and, indeed, as noted in Myrdal's own writings, several of his relatives have severed ties with him after personal conflicts, due to his abandonment of their relationships, or in protest of his portrayals of the Myrdal family. By 2019, Myrdal still writes regularly for Folket i Bild/Kulturfront (FiB/K), which he helped create and run in the 1970s and which remains a bastion for his remaining political supporters. He is also actively involved with the , a literary society created in 2008 to support his writing and stimulate research into his work. The Society leadership and Myrdal himself have publicly clashed over a number of different issues, both political and financial. The Society currently supports the 50,000-volume Jan Myrdal Library, which consists of his personal library, donated for the purpose of creating a permanent collection open to researchers. According to the Jan Myrdal Society, about a third of the volumes in the Jan Myrdal Library are held by no other Swedish library, testifying to Myrdal's decades of book- collecting in Sweden, in Europe, and during his Asian, African, and Latin American travels. The library is located in Varberg, and so is Myrdal himself, renting an apartment from the Society in the library building and helping to catalogize its contents. Myrdal is an honorary doctor of literature at Upsala College in New Jersey, USA, and a PhD at Nankai University in Tianjin in China. Writing Over the years, Myrdal has developed a wide range of special interests, typically striving to place any issue in a vivid historical and social context that will, as often as not, tie into the political issues of the day. His writings deal with such diverse topics as 19th Century French caricature, Afghanistan, Balzac, wartime propaganda posters, the Indian Naxalites, wine, Meccano, sex, death, and Strindberg; the latter is a towering figure in Swedish literature, whose intellectual eclecticism, ceaseless feuding, and strident politics appear, in many respects, to have provided a model for Myrdal's own literary and public persona. The line dividing between art, literature, and politics is generally thin and fluid, if at all existent, in Myrdal's works, and he will often dive into far-ranging historical and cultural exposés, circling back hundreds of years to contextualize contemporary politics. As an author, Myrdal is self-taught. Having dropped out of gymnasium to concentrate on his writing, he was briefly employed as a journalist at a local newspaper and struggled to find a publisher for early novel drafts. Report from a Chinese Village (1963) was not his first published book, but it became a major breakthrough, including on the international level. He would later publish similar \\"reports\\" and travel notes from Asian countries, including India, Afghanistan, and the then-Soviet Central Asian republics, in collaboration with his life partner, . His 1968 book Confessions of a Disloyal European was chosen by The New York Times as one of that year's \\"ten books of particular significance and excellence.\\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/094170226X In 1982 Myrdal returned to the Chinese village he had reported on in 1962 and recorded his observations in Return to a Chinese Village (1984), in which he expressed his disappointment at the changes that had occurred and his continued support of Mao's programs, including the Cultural Revolution. Myrdal's best-known works - in Sweden as well as abroad - include his many autobiographical books, I novels. These dea mainly with his childhood and his complex, conflicted relationship with his parents, Alva Myrdal and Gunnar Myrdal. The entire suite of autobiographical material is non-chronological and contains numerous repetitions and reformulations. According to Anton Honkonen, the assembled autobiographical material comprises a total of fifteen volumes and more than 3 250 pages, spread over 57 years of publishing.https://www.lindelof.nu/wp- content/uploads/2019/04/Honkonen-JM_Paper.pdf Through the publication of Childhood (in Swedish as Barndom, 1982), Myrdal's I novels became strongly associated with the controversy surrounding his tense relationship to his famous parents. Later I books have moved away in part from the childhood theme to focus on Myrdal's experiences of old age, but regularly rehash and comment on early life experiences. Myrdal's most recent book, Ett andra anstånd (\\"A Second Reprieve\\", 2019) is a prime example of the later I novels: although it does spend a great deal of time on the childhood years and on the conflicts with Alva and Gunnar, the central focus is elsewhere: themes of aging and death, loneliness and past loves, sex and the lack thereof, and Myrdal's attempts to unearth unflattering aspects of his life that he had suppressed or distorted in earlier versions – such as contracting venereal disease, and cheating on a wife and being cheated on. One of the central I novels, Maj. En kärlek (1998), which deals with Myrdal's second marriage, is scheduled for republication with newly added material in 2020.

He has been a fervent advocate of anti-colonialist and anti-imperialist causes. Myrdal's influence on the cultural and political life of Sweden was most prominent in the 1970s, when he was arguably the most important intellectual on the radical left. He was a central figure in the Vietnam war protest movement, which marked the high point of the leftist wave that began in Sweden in the late 1960s. However, unlike many of his former supporters, Myrdal has maintained his views up to this day, regardless of their diminishing popularity. Today, his direct political influence is less evident outside narrowly far-left circles, but he remains a popular author and continues to have some political visibility outside the hard left as a pugnacious and contrarian voice on a variety of issues. Despite his record of supporting a number of authoritarian governments at the international level, Myrdal is strongly opposed to limitations on free speech on principle, and he has repeatedly argued in favor of civil liberties for everyone – including racists, Nazis, and Islamists. In Marxist terms, he stresses that the left must defend \\"bourgeois liberties\\" as a valuable historical step forward as well as a matter of self-defense: to accept infringements on personal and public freedoms in the name of security, order, or public decency would ultimately only serve repressive and reactionary purposes, facilitating the suppression of the working class. In line with these positions, Myrdal was sharply critical of the Swedish constitution of 1974, which was introduced in order to modernize Sweden's old and in some ways archaic 19th Century constitution. To Myrdal, the new constitution did not symbolize modernity or a democratic step forward, rather, it was a dilution of the protections and division of power which are enshrined in past constitutional arrangements (see e.g. Skriftställning 6: Lag utan ordning, 1975). A critic of contemporary feminism, he has also been accused of insensitivity with regard to gender issues and homophobia, after criticising elements of Sweden's pro-LGBT campaigns, including marriage equality and homosexual adoption. Same-sex marriages were legalized in Sweden in 2009. In the debates which preceded the passage of the new law, Myrdal was virtually alone among leftists when he joined mostly Christian conservative voices in condemning the new law. Myrdal has countered the criticism by noting that he previously advocated gay rights as a member of the Communist Youth back in the 1940s, and he says his point is that legislators need to respect social reality and children have a right to a legally recognized biological mother and father. He rejects the idea that he is a homophobe, complaining that the allegation has become an \\"online truth\\" and he also says that he has no objection to same sex marriages on principle. According to Myrdal, he does object to any laws that would force Christian, Muslim, Jewish, etc., clergy to marry same-sex couples, but he says that to \\"[t]o call this an objection to gay marriage is senseless.\\"Folket i Bild/Kulturfront, No 3/2012 \\"Om könet och politiken\\", s 44–45: \\"Äktenskapet är – numera – en enkel juridisk form för att reglera inbördes ekonomi och arv och faderskap. Samkönade äktenskap är inte konstigare än mitt och Guns som av enkla skäl (hennes tioåriga sanatorietid) från början var medvetet barnlöst.\\" (...) \\"Att kalla detta för motstånd mot homoäktenskap är vettlöst.\\" After being embroiled in several acrimonious debates in the 1980s and 1990s in which he defended the right of anti-Semitic agitators and Holocaust deniers to be heard, including Ahmed Rami and Robert Faurisson, while also taking positions in favor of Palestinian attacks against Israelis and the government of Iran, Myrdal has been dogged by allegations of anti-Semitism. He dismisses the criticism. Regarding Israel, Myrdal views Zionism as an imperialist phenomenon and Israel as a colonial settler-state, which should be dissolved and replaced by a binational Arab-Jewish state. Myrdal vigorously opposes the international influence of the United States, claiming it is driven by a quest for oil and hegemonic power. He is generally of the opinion that authentic movements for national self-determination or popular liberation must be supported regardless of the ideological or cultural forms these movements may take in their specific cultural and political context. Himself an atheist, he argues that it is right and just for Marxists to make common cause with conservative religious movements in so far as they are authentic representatives of popular aspirations, and he illustrates his point with historical examples: just as one can identify progressive advances achieved by e.g. religion-driven farmers' rebellions in the European Middle Ages, such as the Jan Huss uprising, so one should attempt to support authentic popular forces and anti-Imperialist movements in Asia and Africa today, without attempting to impose one's own time-and-place-specific political agenda on their struggles. In keeping with this attitude, Myrdal has backed Taliban resistance to US-led coalition forces in Afghanistan, including after a Swedish ISAF contingent joined the US-led forces. In a 2009 FiB/K article titled \\"Death to the Occupiers!\\" he stated that it was correct to desire the death of Swedish soldiers in Afghanistan in the 2000s, just as it was to wish for the death of Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan in the 1980s, or British colonial troops a hundred years earlier. To Myrdal, \\"in the current political situation, only if ISAF soldiers, including the Swedish ones, are brought home in body bags and then buried with military honors (and inspiring ministerial speeches!) can the Afghans find peace.\\" More succinctly, he told Hezbollah's al-Intiqad magazine in 2006: \\"The question of international solidarity is in fact very simple. We formulated it during the war against US aggression in South East Asia: - Support the Liberation front on their own conditions!\\" Since the late 1990s, Myrdal has drawn considerable criticism for his defense of the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre in China. In keeping with his dim view of Mao Tse-tung's successors, he originally sympathized with the student protests in Beijing and, after the crackdown in 1989, he condemned the Chinese government as \\"a military regime of the fascist type.\\" By 1997, however, he publicly revised his earlier opinion on the grounds that the crackdown was necessary in order to prevent China from spinning into internal conflict and thus preserve East-Asian stability. Responding to his critics, he stated that the original student protests were well-founded but the Chinese Communist Party had failed to respond constructively to popular demands. The party's intransigent attitude as well as provocations by some demonstrators aggravated the situation, which led to a tragic crisis in which the state's stability was at stake. Therefore, \\"[t]he question can not be whether it was moral or immoral to shed blood on the square of Heavenly Peace in the summer of 1989, but whether it was necessary or not in order to prevent a Bosnia in billion-size proportion and a possible Pacific war. If it was necessary, as I now believe, then it was right and moral. If it was not necessary, then it was wrong and criminal.\\"https://marxistarkiv.se/skribenter/parner/jm.pdf This view has been met with little understanding in Sweden, and, along with Myrdal's defense of Pol Pot, it is often invoked by critics as evidence that his politics are beyond the pale.

He was judge in the trial of Guy Fawkes following the Gunpowder Plot. He held several important offices, including Lord Chief Justice, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer and Solicitor General for England and Wales. Early life Fleming was the son of John Fleming, a general trader and mercer of Newport on the Isle of Wight, and his wife Dorothy Harris. The family lived in a house just to the east of the entrance to the corn market from the High Street in Newport. The Fleming family line had strong historical connections to the Isle of Wight, with several mentions of the name cropping up in previous historical documents and books. He went to school in Godshill and studied law at Lincoln's Inn where he was called to the bar in 1574.

Date accessed: 13 December 2011 Career In 1581, Fleming was elected Member of Parliament for Kingston upon Hull after the existing members were dismissed as idle and impotent. He was elected MP for Winchester in 1584, and was re-elected in 1593. His progression within the legal profession was fast (possibly due to several personal connections with the monarch); he became a serjeant-at-law in 1594, and shortly afterwards became Recorder of London. Solicitor General In 1595, on the personal intervention of Elizabeth I, Fleming (in preference to Francis Bacon) was promoted to the position of Solicitor General, succeeding Sir Edward Coke who had become Attorney General. Historians regard the Queen's decision as a pointed reminder to her courtiers, most of whom had lobbied hard for Bacon, that she had the ultimate power of patronage.Sir J. E. Neale Elizabeth I Pelican Books reissue pp.340–1 Fleming was praised by his contemporaries, more particularly Coke, for his \\"great judgments, integrity and discretion\\". In 1597, Fleming was elected MP for Hampshire. He purchased the North Stoneham estate in 1599 from the young Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton who inherited the title and estate at the age of eight. He was elected MP for Southampton in 1601, but his maiden speech on 20 November of that year was a disaster and Fleming broke down; he never addressed the House of Commons again. When James I became King in 1603, Fleming was reappointed Solicitor General and was knighted on 23 July 1603. He was re-elected MP for Southampton for another term in 1604. Lord Chief Baron Sir Thomas Fleming by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger. He was elevated to the bench as Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer in 1604. It was in this capacity that he tried Guy Fawkes, having been one of the members of parliament at the time of the Gunpowder Plot. His conduct during the trial was criticised as he was accused of attempting \\"to look wise, and say nothing\\". Another notable case during his tenure as Chief Baron was Bates's Case, also called The Case of Impositions, of 1606, on the power of the Crown to levy taxes without Parliamentary approval. John Bates, a merchant trading with Turkey, had refused to pay the unpopular tax on the import of currants. Fleming, in giving judgement for the Crown, held in effect that the King had an unlimited power to levy taxes in any way he thought fit: the power of the King is both ordinary and absolute... absolute power, existing for the nation's safety, varies with the royal wisdom. The judgement was controversial and was even said to have contributed to the tensions between Charles I and Parliament in the next reign. Fleming, a merchant's son, also displayed a somewhat cynical attitude to the business community, dismissing appeals to the common good with the scathing remark that the end of every private merchant is not the common good but his particular profit .State Trials, Volume 2 Lord Chief Justice In 1607, on the death of Sir John Popham, Fleming was elevated to the post of Lord Chief Justice of England. The following year he obtained a Charter for Incorporation for Newport from the King, providing for the election of a Mayor instead of the historical appointed Bailiff. He assisted in the establishment of a free grammar school in the town. Also in 1608, Fleming was one of the judges at the trial of the post nati in 1608, siding with the majority of the judges in declaring that persons born in Scotland after the accession of James I were entitled to the privileges of natural-born subjects in England. The convocation of Oxford University granted him the award of MA on 7 August 1613, which was the day he died. Death Fleming's tomb, which is shared with his wife; the surviving children are represented by the praying statuettes Fleming died suddenly on 7 August 1613 at Stoneham Park in Hampshire, having given to his servants and farm-labourers what was known in Hampshire as a \\"hearing day.\\" After joining in the festivities, he went to bed, apparently in sound health, but was taken suddenly ill, and died before morning. He was buried in St. Nicolas' Church, North Stoneham, where a stately monument records the numerous successes of his career. Known locally as the \\"Floating Flemings\\", it is ornamented with recumbent whole length figures of Fleming in his robes, with his official insignia, and his wife, with ruff and hood, and the singular waist favoured by ladies of the Tudor era. Underneath is the following inscription: Family The Fleming Arms pub in Swaythling Fleming married on 13 February 1570 to his cousin, Mary James, the daughter of Dr Mark James, who was a personal physician of Queen Elizabeth I. They were married at St Thomas' Church, Newport, and lived at Carisbrooke Priory, the lease of which he purchased from the Secretary of State, Francis Walsingham. They had fifteen children of whom six sons and two daughters survived after Fleming's death. His sons Thomas and Philip were both members of parliament. His son Francis was Master of the Horse to Oliver Cromwell. Other sons were Walter, John, James and William. His daughters were Elizabeth, Mary, Jane, Eleanor, Dowsabell, Mary and another of name unknown. There was another child of name and gender unknown.

Set in the London criminal underworld, the film contains two intertwined plots: one dealing with the search for a stolen diamond, the other with a small-time boxing promoter (Jason Statham) who finds himself under the thumb of a ruthless gangster (Alan Ford) who is ready and willing to have his subordinates carry out severe and sadistic acts of violence. The film features an assortment of characters, including Irish Traveller \\"One Punch\\" Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt), referred to as a \\"pikey\\", arms-dealer Boris \\"the Blade\\" Yurinov (Rade Šerbedžija), professional thief and gambling addict Franky \\"Four-Fingers\\" (Benicio del Toro), American gangster-jeweller Abraham Denovitz known as \\"Cousin Avi\\" (Dennis Farina), small-time crooks Sol (Lennie James) and Vinny (Robbie Gee), getaway driver Tyrone (Ade) and bounty hunter Bullet-Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones). It is also distinguished by a kinetic direction and editing style, an intricate double plot featuring numerous ironic twists of chance and causality, and a fast pace. The film shares themes, ideas and motifs with Ritchie's first film, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. It is also filmed in the same visual style and features many of the same actors, including Vinnie Jones, Jason Statham, Jason Flemyng and Alan Ford. Plot After stealing an diamond in a heist in Antwerp, Franky \\"Four-Fingers\\" goes to London to see diamond dealer Doug \\"The Head\\" on behalf of New York jeweller \\"Cousin Avi\\". One of the other robbers advises Franky to obtain a gun from ex- KGB agent Boris \\"The Blade\\", then later calls Boris and encourages him to steal the diamond from him before he can turn it over to Doug. Meanwhile, boxing promoter and slot machine shop owner Turkish persuades gangster \\"Brick Top\\" to put boxer \\"Gorgeous George\\" in a matchup against one of Brick Top's boxers. However, when Turkish sends his partner Tommy and Gorgeous George to purchase a caravan from a group of Irish Travellers, George gets into a fight with Mickey O'Neil, a bare-knuckle boxing champion who badly injures George. Turkish persuades Mickey to replace George in his upcoming match by agreeing to purchase a new caravan for Mickey's mother. Brick Top agrees to the change on the condition that Mickey throws the fight in the fourth round. Boris gives Franky a revolver in exchange for a favour: Franky is to place a bet on Boris' behalf at Brick Top's bookies. Avi, knowing Franky has a gambling problem, flies to London with his bodyguard \\"Rosebud\\" to claim the diamond personally. Boris hires Vinny and Sol, two small-time crooks, to rob Franky while he is at the bookies. The robbery goes awry and Sol, Vinny, and their driver Tyrone are caught on camera, but manage to kidnap Franky. Instead of throwing the fight, Mickey accidentally knocks his opponent out with a single punch due to his overwhelming power. Infuriated, Brick Top robs Turkish of his savings and demands that Mickey fight again, and lose this time since the majority of people will bet on Mickey. Mickey refuses to fight again unless Turkish buys a better caravan for his mother, but Turkish has no money left since Brick Top stole his savings. Furious, Brick Top has his men vandalize Turkish's gambling arcade and burn down Mickey's mother's caravan while she is asleep inside. Meanwhile, Boris retrieves the diamond and murders Franky with a pistol. Brick Top tracks down Sol, Vinny, Tyrone, and their friend, Yardie \\"Bad Boy\\" Lincoln and plans on killing them for robbing his bookies. Sol bargains for their lives by promising Brick Top the stolen diamond, and is given 48 hours to retrieve it. Avi and Doug hire \\"Bullet-Tooth\\" Tony to help them find Franky. When the trail leads to Boris, they kidnap him and retrieve the diamond, closely pursued by Sol, Vinny, and Tyrone. Turkish and Tommy, who are on their way to purchase a gun from Boris, are driving on the same stretch of road at the time. When Tommy throws Turkish's carton of milk out of their car window, it splashes over Tony's windscreen, causing him to crash and killing Rosebud in the process. Boris escapes from the wreck only to be hit by Tyrone's car. Tony and Avi are confronted by Sol, Vinny, and Tyrone at a pub where Tony realizes that the trio's pistols are replicas, which he contrasts with his real handgun, intimidating them into leaving. The wounded Boris arrives with an assault rifle and a grenade launcher looking for the diamond, but is shot and killed by Tony, who wounds Tyrone at the same time. Sol and Vinny leave a wounded Tyrone and escape with the diamond, which Vinny hides in his pants. When Tony catches up to them, they tell him that the diamond is back at their pawn shop. Once there, they produce the diamond, but it is promptly swallowed by a dog that Vinny got from the travellers. Avi wildly fires at the fleeing dog, accidentally killing Tony. He gives up and returns to New York. Mickey agrees to fight to avoid more carnage, but gets so drunk after his mother's wake that Turkish fears he will not make it to the fourth round. If he fails to go down as agreed, Brick Top's men will execute Turkish, Tommy, Mickey, and the entire campsite of travellers. Mickey makes it to the fourth round, when he suddenly knocks out his opponent. Outside the arena, as Tommy, Turkish and Mickey try to run for their life, Brick Top and his men are killed by the travellers. Mickey has bet on himself to win, and waited until the fourth round to allow the travellers time to ambush and kill Brick Top's men at the campsite. The next morning, Turkish and Tommy find the travellers' campsite deserted as Mickey and the travellers have escaped with their winnings. When confronted by the police, they cannot explain why they are there, until Vinny's dog suddenly arrives and they claim to be walking it. Sol and Vinny are arrested when the police find Franky and Tony's bodies in their car. Turkish and Tommy take the dog to a veterinarian to extract a squeaky toy that it had swallowed, and discover the diamond in its stomach, as well. They consult Doug about selling the diamond and he calls Avi, who returns to London.

Documentary of film production. . Reception Box office Snatch was largely successful, both in critical response and financial gross, and has gone on to develop a devoted cult following. From a budget of $10 million, the movie grossed £12,137,698 in the United Kingdom, $30.3 million in the United States and Canada, and a total of $83.6 million worldwide. Critical response On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 73%, based on 141 reviews, with a weighted average score of 6.41/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Though perhaps a case of style over substance, Guy Ritchie's second crime caper is full of snappy dialogue, dark comedy, and interesting characters.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score 55 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Snatch also appears on Empire magazine's 2008 poll of the 500 greatest movies of all time at number 466. While the film received mostly positive reviews, several reviewers commented negatively on perceived similarities in plot, character, setting, theme and style between Snatch and Ritchie's previous work, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. In his review, Roger Ebert gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, writing that while ostensibly rooted in the London underworld, Pitt's Irish traveller community were the most interesting element of the plot and the film's clearest predecessors were all American: Dick Tracy comics, Damon Runyon stories, and zany Marx Brothers comedies. He raised the question of \\"What am I to say of 'Snatch', Ritchie's new film, which follows the 'Lock, Stock' formula so slavishly it could be like a new arrangement of the same song?\\" Writing in the New York Times Elvis Mitchell commented that \\"Mr. Ritchie seems to be stepping backward when he should be moving ahead\\". Some critics also argued that the film was lacking in depth and substance; many reviewers appeared to agree with Ebert's comment that \\"the movie is not boring, but it doesn't build and it doesn't arrive anywhere\\". Soundtrack Two versions of the soundtrack album were released, one on the Universal International label with 23 tracks and a TVT Records release with 20.

On 3 July 2001, a two-disc \\"Special Edition\\" was released, containing both a full screen and widescreen presentation of the feature. Also included was an audio commentary track with director Guy Ritchie and producer Matthew Vaughn. The special features on the second disc included a \\"making of\\" featurette, deleted scenes, original theatrical trailer and TV spots, text/photo galleries, storyboard comparisons, and filmographies. On 17 September 2002, Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment released a \\"Deluxe Collection\\" DVD as part of the company's Superbit series. This release contained two discs, one being the special features disc of the original DVD release, and the other a superbit version of the feature. As is the case with superbit presentations, the disc was absent of the additional features included in the original standard DVD, such as the audio commentary. (The disc did still contain subtitles in eight different languages including a \\"pikey\\" track, which only showed subtitles for the character Mickey.) Nine months later, on 3 June 2003, a single disc setup was released, with new cover art, containing the feature disc of the special edition set. This version was simply a repackaging, omitting the second disc. Television On 20 April 2016, Crackle announced that the go-ahead for a new television series, based on the film, had been agreed. On 22 August it was confirmed that Rupert Grint would both be executive producer and would star in the show. The series debuted on 16 March 2017 and had two seasons.

Early life in South Africa  Mathabane was born in Alexandra, South Africa, an area that is a part of Johannesburg, the capital of the province of Gauteng. He was born to a life of poverty in the apartheid political setting of South Africa. His father was Jackson Mathabane, a Venda labourer who had an income of $10 a month. Mathabane has also stated that his father struggled with alcohol and gambling, and was even abusive. Magdalene Mathabane was Mathabane's mother. She had been sold to Jackson Mathabane as a wife at the age of fifteen by her mother. Jackson and Magdalene Mathabane had seven children, of whom Mark Mathabane was the eldest.  Life in the ghetto  Mathabane and his family lived in a one-square-mile ghetto which was also home to more than 200,000 other individuals. These living conditions lacked the modern commodities of paved roads, electricity, and even sewer systems. Food was scarce in this ghetto, and the homes were nothing more than rough shacks. Mathabane never even had his first pair of shoes until he was fourteen years old. Mathabane's early life in apartheid South Africa was devastating. He has stated that \\"living in apartheid was like living in Hell.\\" At the young age of six, Mathabane joined his first gang. Mathabane has stated that this lifestyle was horrific but that he did learn to cope in this environment. However, he has stated that it was the elements of this environment which suppressed his spirit with which he was not able to cope. This suppression of his spirit even drove Mathabane to the brink of suicide at the age of ten.  Mathabane's mother  Mathabane has credited his illiterate mother with encouraging him to excel in education and to escape the confinements of apartheid South Africa. He has repeatedly mentioned her ability to always display love and encouragement even in her troublesome lifestyle. Mathabane's mother took a job to send him to school when he was seven. Many problems ensued from this endeavour since his father did not support the idea of obtaining an education.  First steps to escape from Apartheid  Mathabane's grandmother worked as a gardener, and he attributes some of the first steps in his eventual escape from apartheid South Africa to an instance when he went to work with his grandmother. The family that his grandmother worked for gave him his first English book, which was Treasure Island. From this book, Mathabane began to dream of escaping the apartheid lifestyle. Additionally, the family gave him his first tennis racket, which he used to train himself tennis. Tennis would later become a key element in his eventual escape from apartheid South Africa.  Change of name  Mathabane randomly began to identify as Mark instead of Johannes when he first began playing tennis at Ellis Park and was introduced to his first white friend.  Life in America   Tennis and move to America  1972 Wimbledon tennis star Stan Smith, was a key element in helping Mathabane obtain a tennis scholarship to the United States. Mathabane met Smith in 1977 at the South African Championship tennis tournament in Johannesburg. In 1978, with the aid of Smith, Mathabane moved to the United States and started attending Limestone College in South Carolina. * [Abe 'Scara' Thomas] - Was like a father to Mark. He introduced him to tennis, gave him his first tennis racquet and mentored/coached him until he got the scholarship to the USA. He introduced Mark to different people who were prominent in the tennis circle. My dad is the \\"freckled faced colored man\\" referred to in the book. Abe Thomas loved Marvel comic books and collected them.  College life  Mathabane was faced with a whole new world in America. Even though he had escaped apartheid from South Africa, racial discrimination and prejudice still existed in America. Mathabane attended Limestone College in 1978 and then moved to Saint Louis University in 1979. Following that, Mathabane attended Quincy College in 1981 and then moved to Dowling College. While attending Dowling College Mathabane became the first Black editor of the school magazine. He graduated Dowling College cum laude with a degree in Economics in 1983. Mathabane also pursued graduate level studies at Poynter Institute and the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism. Later on in his life, Mathabane received an honorary doctorate from Wittenberg University.  Early success  Mathabane wrote his autobiography, Kaffir Boy, in 1986. Kaffir Boy illustrated his prior life in apartheid South Africa, and became a national best-seller. After reading Kaffir Boy, Oprah Winfrey invited Mathabane to appear on her show. Mathabane went on to write several other literary works. (See LITERARY WORKS section.)  Recent life  Mathabane had his first visit to the White House in 1993 after being invited by President Bill Clinton, who had read Kaffir Boy. From 1992–1993, Mathabane served as a White House Fellow under US President Bill Clinton, and assisted him with his educational policies. Mathabane has written articles for some print sources. He has also been a guest on several different TV and radio shows, and is also a well-known speaker. Mathabane and his wife, Gail (née Ernsberger), their three children (Bianca, b. 1989, Nathan b. 1991 and Stanley b. 1994), and his extended family lived in North Carolina. They relocated to Portland, Oregon in 2004, where he was formerly director of multicultural education at Catlin Gabel School.  Magdalene Scholarship Fund  In 2000, Mathabane established a non-profit organisation which he named after his mother Magdalene. As stated on Mathabane's website, the fund's mission is to: \\"create hope in an impoverished, bleak part of the world by providing scholarships, books, uniforms and school supplies for needy children attending Bovet Primary School in Alexandra Township, South Africa.\\"  Literary works   Kaffir Boy: The True Story of a Black Youth's Coming of Age in Apartheid South Africa  Mathabane's first book was Kaffir Boy: the True Story of a Black Youth's Coming of Age in Apartheid South Africa, which was published in 1986, is an autobiography of his early life in apartheid South Africa. This book was listed as number one on the Washington Post's best- sellers list, and as number three on the New York Times best-seller list. Kaffir Boy has also won a Christopher Award, has been translated into several different languages, and is also used in many American classrooms.  Kaffir Boy in America: An Encounter with Apartheid  Mathabane's second book Kaffir Boy in America: An Encounter with Apartheid was also his second autobiography, and was published in 1989. Kaffir Boy in America picked up where Kaffir Boy had left off and followed Mathabane's early life in America.  Love in Black and White: The Triumph of Love over Prejudice and Taboo  In 1992, Mathabane coauthored his third book, Love in Black and White: The Triumph of Love over Prejudice and Taboo, with his wife Gail. Love in Black and White examined Mark and Gail's interracial relationship, and the obstacles that they faced.  African Women: Three Generations  African Women: Three Generations was Mathabane's fourth book, published in 1994. African Women tells the true story of the struggles of Mathabane's grandmother, mother, and sister in South Africa.  Ubuntu  In 1999, Mathabane wrote his first novel Ubuntu. Ubuntu is a fictional thriller of a human rights lawyer in post-apartheid South Africa.  Miriam's Song  Miriam's Song was published in 2000, and was nominated for the Alan Paton Award. Miriam's Song is a true account of the struggles of Mathabane's sister Miriam in apartheid South Africa.  The Proud Liberal  Mathabane's latest work of fiction, The Proud Liberal, was published in 2010. The Proud Liberal is a modern-day thriller, which deals with controversial issues such as terrorism, racism, and intolerance in America.

The IUPAC name for β-alanine is 3-aminopropanoic acid. Unlike its counterpart α-alanine, β-alanine has no stereocenter. Biosynthesis and industrial route In terms of its biosynthesis, it is formed by the degradation of dihydrouracil and carnosine. β-Alanine ethyl ester is the ethyl ester which hydrolyses within the body to form β-alanine. It is produced industrially by the reaction of ammonia with β-propiolactone.Karlheinz Miltenberger \\"Hydroxycarboxylic Acids, Aliphatic\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2005. Biochemical function β-Alanine is not found in any major proteins or enzymes. It is a component of the naturally occurring peptides carnosine and anserine and also of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), which itself is a component of coenzyme A. Under normal conditions, β-alanine is metabolized into acetic acid. β-Alanine is the rate-limiting precursor of carnosine, which is to say carnosine levels are limited by the amount of available β-alanine, not histidine. Supplementation with β-alanine has been shown to increase the concentration of carnosine in muscles, decrease fatigue in athletes and increase total muscular work done. Simply supplementing with carnosine is not as effective as supplementing with β-alanine alone since carnosine, when taken orally, is broken down during digestion to its components, histidine and β-alanine. Hence, by weight, only about 40% of the dose is available as β-alanine. Comparison of β-alanine (right) with the more customary (chiral) amino acid, L-α-alanine (left) L-Histidine, with a pKa of 6.1 is a relatively weak buffer over the physiological intramuscular pH range. However, when bound to other amino acids, this increases nearer to 6.8-7.0. In particular, when bound to β-alanine, the pKa value is 6.83, making this a very efficient intramuscular buffer. Furthermore, because of the position of the beta amino group, β-alanine dipeptides are not incorporated into proteins, and thus can be stored at relatively high concentrations (millimolar). Occurring at 17–25 mmol/kg (dry muscle), carnosine (β-alanyl-L-histidine) is an important intramuscular buffer, constituting 10-20% of the total buffering capacity in type I and II muscle fibres. Even though much weaker than glycine (and, thus, with a debated role as a physiological transmitter), β-alanine is an agonist next in activity to the cognate ligand glycine itself, for strychnine-sensitive inhibitory glycine receptors (GlyRs) (the agonist order: glycine ≫ β-alanine > taurine ≫ alanine, L-serine > proline).Encyclopedia of Life Sciences Amino Acid Neurotransmitters. Jeremy M Henley, 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. , Article Online Posting Date: April 19, 2001  Athletic performance enhancement  There is evidence that β-alanine supplementation can increase exercise and cognitive performance, but there is concern about lack of information about safety. Ingestion of β-Alanine can cause paraesthesia, reported as a tingling sensation, in a dose-dependent fashion.  Metabolism  Sources for β-alanine includes pyrimidine catabolism of cytosine and uracil. β-Alanine can undergo a transamination reaction with pyruvate to form malonate-semialdehyde and L-alanine. The malonate semialdehyde can then be converted into malonate via malonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase. Malonate is then converted into malonyl-CoA and enter fatty acid biosynthesis.

In August 2002, Presto Studios shut down new development after the release of the Xbox title Whacked!. In a statement, Greg Uhler (executive producer) announced the closing of the company: > Due to business, financial, and personal reasons, Presto Studios is > discontinuing software development.

A minimal staff, including > Michel and myself, will be here until the end of October. Closure of the company Whacked! for Xbox was Presto Studios' final title before closing its doors shortly afterward. Though still in decent financial shape, Presto was facing an uphill challenge in the transition from the PC to console game market. The directors of the company anticipated a rapidly shrinking PC game market and decided to close the company while it was ahead. A significant number of the creative staff moved on to high-profile roles in motion picture and animation production.

Part of the legislation during the apartheid era, the National Party introduced it to enforce racial segregation, and was part of a deliberate process to remove all non-white people from the voters' roll and revoke the Cape Qualified Franchise system. This act was declared invalid by the Supreme Court when challenged in the case of Harris v Minister of the Interior 1952(2) SA 428(AD); this gave rise to the Coloured vote constitutional crisis. The government, however, was able to circumvent the court's decision by increasing the number of Appellate Division judges from five to eleven, and increasing the size of the Senate from forty-eight to eighty-nine. These changes enabled the government to successfully introduce the South Africa Act Amendment Act No 9 of 2 March 1956, effectively overturning the Supreme Court's decision and revalidating the act. This amendment was repealed by the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act 32 of 1961. This case was one of many where South Africa's parliamentary sovereignty enabled the passing of laws without being subject to judicial review on substantive grounds. The judiciary was bound therefore leaving the legislature and executive to act independently from the third arm of government. Arguably this silencing of the judiciary allowed the Apartheid state to become further entrenched in the legal sphere of South Africa. The act as a whole was repealed by section 4 of the Separate Representation of Voters Amendment Act No 50 of 27 March 1968. This bill introduced the Coloured Persons Representative Council, consisting of forty elected members and twenty nominated members. This council could make laws on finance, local government, education, community welfare and pensions, rural settlements and agriculture which affected coloured people. A bill could only be introduced when approved by the Minister of Coloured Relations, as well as requiring the approval of the white Cabinet. This act was repealed in 1983 by section 101(1) of the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act No 110.

Floorspace rents are the highest in Australia, in part due to other cities' shopping precincts being longer. In 2015, its rents were the fifth-highest in the world in terms of city streets. Despite its small size, Pitt Street Mall hosts many flagship chain stores and more than 400 specialty stores.\\"Pitt Street Mall - Unofficial website (About Us)\\" It is one of the flagship venues of Sydney Fashion Week held in the month of May. http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion- beauty/article/2145660/sydney-fashion-week-eight-stylish-shopping- neighbourhoods History Pitt Street, looking south across the King Street intersection, ca.1900 Formerly a vehicular street, the mall was closed off to traffic in the 1990s and became a pedestrian mall. This was commonplace in various Australian cities at the time, in an effort to encourage \\"walk-in\\" business. Many prominent Australian businesses had flagship stores along Pitt Street, namely Sportsgirl and Angus & Robertson. In the mid 2000s, there were attempts to make the mall a completely pedestrian thoroughfare, diverting all vans and trucks to the underground corridor from underground corridor from King Street to Market Street, at the south of the mall. 2010–2011: redevelopment Along with extensive upgrades to retail areas, the Pitt Street Mall's pedestrian area saw a A$10 million refurbishment during 2010-11. This included the provision of new seating as well as new pavers and a catenary lighting system.

Ltd.) was an Australian beer group with interests in brewing and soft drinks. Foster's Group Limited was based in Melbourne, Victoria and was renamed Carlton & United Breweries prior to sale to British-South African multinational SABMiller in 2011. Foster's Group was the brewer of Foster's Lager. Foster's wine business was split into a separate company, Treasury Wine Estates, in May 2011. Since 10 October 2016 when Anheuser-Busch InBev acquired the entire SABMiller company, the latter - including its subsidiaries such as Foster's - has been a business division of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV. SABMiller ceased to exist as a corporation. SABMiller also ceased trading on global stock markets. As a result, Foster's Group became a direct subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV. In 2019, Business Insider reported that Asahi Group Holdings, \\"one of the largest beverage companies in Japan, will buy AB InBev's Australian assets, including Foster's beer and Carlton and United Breweries.\\" In June 2020, Anheuser-Busch InBev completed the sale of Carlton and United Breweries to Asahi Group Holdings. History It was founded in Melbourne in 1888 by two American brothers William and Ralph Foster of New York, United States, who happened to own a refrigeration plant. Cooling was necessary to brew and store acceptable lagers in Australia's hot climate, unlike the English-style dark ales commonly brewed at the time. They sold the brewery the following year and returned to the United States.Dunstan, Keith, The Amber Nectar, ; Australian Brewers' Journal 20-11-1889 In 1983 Elders IXL, a giant Australian diversified conglomerate, purchased Carlton and United Breweries, and renamed it Elders Brewing Group. Then in 1990, the Elders Brewing Group changed its name to the Foster's Group, to reflect the name of their most internationally recognised product. In 2005, Foster's Group acquired the Australian wine-making group Southcorp. This acquisition added famous brands such as Penfolds, Lindemans and Rosemount to the Foster's stable and around A$1 billion to revenues. In May 2011, Foster's Group's Treasury Wine Estates unit was spun off into a separate company. The first day of trading saw its share price soaring, valuing the separate entity at A$2.2 billion. There had long been speculation that the beer sector or all of Foster's Group would be subject to a takeover by a larger firm. Groups to express such an interest over the years have included Diageo, SABMiller, Molson Coors and Heineken International. In September 2011, the board of Fosters agreed to a takeover bid by SABMiller, valuing the company at A$9.9bn (US$10.2bn; £6.5bn). Foster's Group Limited shares (ASX code: FGL) were suspended from trading on the ASX on 2 December 2011 and delisted from the ASX at close of trading on 20 December 2011.Investors, Foster's Group Limited (accessed 13 June 2012) Since October 10, 2016, when Anheuser-Busch InBev acquired SABMiller, Foster's Group has been owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV.

Foster's Group imports, licenses, and distributes a large number of brands. In Australia, Foster's distributes the Cinzano, Perrier, Skyy vodka, Stella Artois, and 42 Below import brands among many others. While in the United States and Canadian markets, Molson brews and sells Foster's Lager under license.

In 2011, Fosters made major losses that including a write down in the value of the wines division to A$1.8 billion that at the business' AGM in Melbourne on 29 April 2011, 99% of Fosters Group shareholders agreed to split Fosters Group business into two separate brewing and wines companies. The wines business became Treasury Wine Estates, and was listed on the ASX on 10 May 2011.

The majority of Muslims in the Netherlands belong to the Sunni denomination. Many reside in the country's four major cities, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. The early history of Islam in the Netherlands can be traced to the 16th century, when a small number of Ottoman merchants began settling in the nation's port cities. As a result, improvised Mosques were first created in Amsterdam in the early 17th century. In the ensuing centuries, the Netherlands experienced sporadic Muslim immigration from the Dutch East Indies, during their long history as part of the Dutch overseas possessions. From the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire after the First World War until the independence of Indonesia, the Dutch East Indies contained the world's largest Muslim population. However, the number of Muslims in the European territory of the Kingdom of the Netherlands was very low, accounting for less than 0.1% of the population. The Netherlands' economic resurgence in the years between 1960 and 1973 motivated the Dutch government to recruit migrant labor, chiefly from Turkey and Morocco. Later waves of immigrants arrived through family reunification and asylum seeking. A notable portion of Muslim immigrants also arrived from now-independent colonies, primarily Indonesia and Suriname. History Ottoman traders and Dutch converts The first traces of Islam in the Netherlands date back to the 16th century. Ottoman and Persian traders settled in many Dutch and Flemish trading towns, and were allowed to practice their faith, although most of them belonged to the Jewish or Greek Orthodox community under the Sultan. The English traveler Andrew Marvell referred to the Netherlands as \\"the place for Turk, Christian, heathen, Jew; staple place for sects and schisms\\" due to the religious freedom and the large number of different religious groups there. References to the Ottoman state and Islamic symbolism were also frequently used within 16th century Dutch society itself, most notably in Protestant speeches called hagenpreken, and in the crescent-shaped medals of the Geuzen, bearing the inscription \\"Rather Turkish than Papists\\". When Dutch forces broke through the Spanish siege of Leiden in 1574, they carried with them Turkish flags into the city.Bevrijders Leiden droegen Turkse vlaggen Historian Ewout Klei on Joop.nl, 14 April 2012 During the Siege of Sluis in Zeeland in 1604, 1400 Turkish slaves were freed by Maurice of Orange from captivity by the Spanish army. The Turks were declared free people and the Dutch state paid for their repatriation. To honor the resistance of the Turkish slaves to their Spanish masters, Prince Maurice named a local embankment \\"Turkeye\\". Around this time the Netherlands also housed a small group of Muslim refugees from the Iberian peninsula, called Moriscos, who would eventually settle in Constantinople. Diplomat Cornelius Haga gained trading privileges from Constantinople for the Dutch Republic in 1612, some 40 years before any other nation recognized Dutch independence.Haga Biography in the NNBW Two years later the Ottomans sent their emissary Ömer Aga to the Netherlands to intensify the relations between the two states with a common enemy. In the 17th century dozens of Dutch, Zeelandic and Frisian sailors converted to Islam and joined the Barbary Pirates in the ports of North- Africa, where some of them even became admirals in the Ottoman Navy. Many sailors converted to escape slavery after being taken captive, while others \\"went Turk\\" of their own volition. Some of the converted Dutchmen returned home to the Netherlands. However, this was deemed problematic, not so much due to their conversion, but due to their disloyalty to the Dutch Republic and its navy. Treaty with Morocco In the early 17th century a delegation from the Dutch Republic visited Morocco to discuss a common alliance against Spain and the Barbary pirates. Sultan Zidan Abu Maali appointed Samuel Pallache as his envoy, and in 1608 Pallache met with stadholder Maurice of Nassau and the States General in The Hague. Dutch East Indies In the 19th century the Netherlands administered the archipelago that would become Indonesia, a majority-Muslim country with the largest Muslim population in the world. In the first half of the 20th century hundreds of Indonesian students, sailors, baboes and domestic workers lived in the Netherlands, thus constituting the first sizable Muslim community. In 1932, Indonesian workers established the Perkoempoelan Islam (Islamic Association), which was a self-help organization that lobbied for the establishment of a Muslim cemetery and a mosque in the Netherlands. Both were realized in 1933.Klaas Stutje, 'Indonesian Islam in Interwar Europe: Muslim Organizations in the Netherlands and beyond.' in Muslims in Interwar Europe: A Transcultural Historical Perspective, edited by Bekim Agai, Umar Ryad, Mehdi Sajid, 125–150. Leiden: Brill, 2015. After the bloody war of Independence from 1945 to 1949 this community grew. The Second World War After Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in the 1940s, a number of Soviet Central Asians, who were mostly from Samarqand in what is now the Muslim-majority Republic of Uzbekistan,Mapping the Global Muslim Population. A Report on the Size and Distribution of the World's Muslim Population . Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life (October 2009) left their homes for the area of Smolensk, to fight the invaders. There, the Nazis managed to take captives, including Hatam Kadirov and Zair Muratov, and transported them to areas like that of Amersfoort concentration camp, where they reportedly persecuted or executed them. The victims' cemetery is that of Rusthof, near Amersfoort. Amongst those who studied their case is Uzbek resident Bahodir Uzakov. Immigration During the 1960s and early 1970s the Netherlands needed a larger low-skilled work force for the labour intense economic sectors. These sectors were short of workers because of swift industrial growth, combined with higher educational levels of the native Dutch who increasingly turned to the service-oriented economy. The Netherlands concluded recruitment agreements with countries like Turkey (1965) and Morocco (1969), allowing people from these countries to stay in the Netherlands (much smaller numbers of Muslim immigrants in this time came from Tunisia and Algeria). State recruitment of immigrant labour ended in 1973, but the number of Moroccans and Turks increased due to family reunification arrangements. A number of Surinamese Muslims came to the Netherlands before and after the independence of Suriname in 1975. In the 1980s and especially since the 1990s, Muslims came to the Netherlands as refugees and asylum seekers, mainly from Bosnia, Somalia, Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iraq. Apart from asylum seekers, currently most Muslim immigration takes place through marriage migration and family reunification. Most Moroccan and Turkish 1st and 2nd generation immigrants married people from their home countries. In 2004, the Netherlands passed immigration laws which force future immigrants and their prospective Dutch partners to abide by very strict requirements. Immigrants must pass tests in their home countries, showing a sufficient knowledge of the Dutch language and culture. The Dutch partner must be at least 21 years old and prove an income of at least 120% of the minimum wage. These strict laws have caused some Dutch interested in marrying people from other countries to move to Belgium for a temporary period, in what has been called \\"The Belgian Route\\". Because of increasingly restrictive legislation on family formation and reunification, and the economic development of their home countries, the number of immigrants from Turkey and Morocco has decreased sharply since 2003. Immigrants from Turkey decreased from 6,703 in 2003 to 3,175 in 2006, and immigrants from Morocco decreased from 4,894 to 2,085. Net immigration has slumped to a few hundred a year, and has even been negative in some years. In 2005 according to the Sociaal en Cultureel Planbureau annual report, half the Dutch population and half the Moroccan and Turkish minorities stated that the Western lifestyle cannot be reconciled with that of Muslims.  Demographics  Share of Muslims as of 2004 According to Statistics Netherlands (CBS), a Dutch governmental institution, about 5% of the total population are Muslims (24 October 2007). Earlier statistics presented by the CBS showed a larger number of Muslims, but this information was solely based on ethnicity and not on religious belief. Since 2007 a reduction of around 50,000 Muslims was measured by the CBS, but this is not seen as a significant drop; it is seen as a result of improved research parameters. Secularisation of the second generation has nonetheless been observed, mostly amongst citizens of Iranian and Turkish background. Between 2006 and 2018, according to surveys the percentage of non-Muslims has increased amongst the Turkish-Dutch as 93% identified as Muslim in 2006 while 86% did so in 2018; amongst the Moroccan- Dutch citizens these percentages were 95% and 94% respectively. However, those remaining Muslim became more orthodox in their religious views.Er zijn minder moslims in Nederland, maar de overgebleven groep wordt steeds orthodoxer 'There are less Muslims in the Netherlands, but the remaining group is becoming more orthodox', Trouw, 8 juni 2018 Various studies from 2006 to 2010 have observed that ethnic differences between groups are gradually being replaced with a single \\"Muslim\\" identity. Like most non-Western immigrants, many Muslims live in the four major cities of the country, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. An estimated 140,000 Muslims reside in the capital where they form around 17 percent of the population. Half of these Muslims are predominantly Arabic and Berber-speaking communities from the Maghreb region, Egypt and the Middle East. Turks make up 25 percent of the Muslim population in Amsterdam. There are also relatively many Turks in Enschede, Arnhem and Zaanstad. There were 850,000 residents who professed Islam in 2006. Of these 38% were ethnic Turkish, 31% were Moroccan, 26% were other Asian/African, 4% were European (Non-Dutch) and 1% (12,000 people) were native Dutch. 40,000 of the Muslims were Pakistanis, 34,000 were Surinamese, 31,000 were Afghan and 27,000 were Iraqi. At the end of 2012 the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics estimated the number of Muslims in 2010-11 to be around 4% of the total population. Denominations and movements There are about 400 mosques in the Netherlands, with about 200 Turkish mosques, 140 Moroccan mosques and 50 Surinamese.  Umbrella organizations  The Contact Body for Muslims and Government (CMO), representing approximately 80 percent of the Muslim community, discusses the community's interests with the Government.  Shi'a Muslims  108,728 Twelver Shiites were reportedly living in the Netherlands as of 1 January 2005. This group is composed of Iraqis (43,523), Afghanis (36,683), and Iranians (28,522). Broken down by ethnic group, Turks have more organisations than Moroccans and networks between these organisations are closer. Ahmadiyya The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community was organized in 1947. There are approximately 1,500 Ahmadi Muslims in the Netherlands and Ahmadiyya Muslim Community Netherlands is the main umbrella organization. Mobarak Mosque in The Hague was inaugurated by Sir Muhammad Zafrulla Khan, who was serving as the President and Head Judge of the International Court of Justice at The Hague. Quranists Non-sectarian Muslims who reject the authority of hadith, known as Quranists, Quraniyoon, or Ahl al-Quran, are also present in the Netherlands.Edip Yuksel, Edip's Semi- personal Report (Oxford 2010) , 19.org, Retrieved April 27, 2013  Jihadists  Jihadists oppose Dutch society and the Dutch government and hold intolerant and anti-democratic views. In 2009, the AIVD reported that armed Islamic extremists in Somalia received support from individuals in the Netherlands. In the years leading up to 2006, there was an increase in radical activity which among other events manifested itself in the assassination of Theo van Gogh in 2004 by the Hofstad Network. In the years after 2006 radical activities diminished despite continued military presence by Dutch forces in Afghanistan and material deemed provocative by Muslims, such as Geert Wilder's film Fitna. While Islamist networks earlier had a strong local base of support centered around charismatic leaders, several of those leaders were arrested and deported by Dutch authorities or they left the country voluntarily. This led to reduced recruiting to those networks. According to the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD) in 2018, there are about 500 active supporters and thousands of sympathisers in the Netherlands. In 2015 the AIVD reported that jihadists exploited the boundaries in the Dutch legal framework, by testing the limits of civil rights such as freedom of speech. In 2017 AIVD approximated the number of female jihadists in the Netherlands to be about 100 and at least 80 women had left the Netherlands to join the conflict, the majority of whom joined ISIS. Jihadist women in the Netherlands encourage both men and women to believe in their ideology by entering into discussions online and offline as well as spreading jihadist propaganda. Jihadist women also help travellers to conflict zones by providing material support or putting them in touch with facilitators. They also help by hiding the fact that someone has left to join a conflict zone. In the 2012 – November 2018 period, above 310 individuals had travelled from the Netherlands to the conflict in Syria and Iraq. Of those 85 had been killed and 55 returned to the Netherlands. Of the surviving Dutch foreign fighters in the region, 135 are fighters in the conflict zone and three quarters are members of ISIS. The remaining quarter have joined Al-Qaeda affiliated groups such as Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham or Tanzim Hurras al-Deen.  Salafists  In 1986, the Saudi non-governmental organization al-Haramain created the El Tawheed Foundation in Amsterdam, which created the basis of the ultra-conservative Salafist movement in the Netherlands. Three years later, the Saudi private missionary organization al- Waqf founded the al-Waqf al-Islami in Eindhoven. In 1990, also with Saudi funding, the Foundation Sounna was created in The Hague. According to a 1998 report by the Dutch security service, Salafists were a minor movement in the Muslim community. Salafist mosques in the Netherlands have a multinational crowd of visitors: from the Middle East and North Africa, the Horn of Africa, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Turkey, while Moroccans are the predominant group. From 2002-2003 onward, a small number of second-generation Moroccan immigrants were drawn to violent radicalization and some of those formed the terrorist Hofstad Network. In 2009, the AIVD reported that Salafist mosques, while spreading an isolationist and intolerant ideology, no longer functioned as incubators for jihadist terrorism and the movement was not growing. This decrease resulted in Dutch governmental organisations to shift their efforts to other problems. Close contacts between salafists in the Netherlands and salafist networks in the Middle East give the latter an influence over factions in the Netherlands, an influence the General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD) describes as undesirable. Along with \\"official\\" centres, there are independent preachers who organize meetings throughout the country as well as an enormous amount of material on the Internet. In 2014, the AIVD noted that growth of the movement had resumed. In 2014, the AIVD reported that the proselyting \\"dawah\\" strand of Salafism, though rejecting jihadist violence, is typified by: * undermining the democratic legal system. * promoting intolerance, discrimination and hatred of Jews and Shia Muslims. * isolationism, where they strive to create \\"enclaves\\" enforced by suppressing dissent through intimidation and excluding those unwilling to conform. In practice few adherents observe isolating strictly. In 2014 there were 13 Salafist mosques in the country which rose to 27 in 2018. The number of Salafist preachers was more than doubled in the same time span, from 50 to 110 according to the Dutch counter-terrorism authority (NCTV). In 2019, an investigation by the Nieuwsuur TV programme and the newspaper NRC, investigated fifty mosque schools, obtaining educational material from ten Quran classes given by fundamentalist organisations. The investigation showed that children were taught that infidels go to hell. Punishments against homosexuals and \\"enemies of God\\" were glorified. In an ideal Islamic state operating under sharia law, heretics would be punished by the death penalty, adulterers stoned and magicians killed by the sword. Children were warned against having social contacts with non-Muslims. Muslims should strive to leave the Netherlands and settle in a Muslim country. When confronted with these results, an imam and a teacher distanced themselves from these elements in the material.https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2019/09/10/in-de-koranschool-leren- kinderen-dat-nederland-niet-hun-land-is-a3972824  Religiosity  Westermoskee is the largest mosque in the Netherlands In 2002, roughly 50% Muslims attended mosque at least once every 2 weeks. This was higher than the amount of Roman Catholics (25%) who attended church once at least once every 2 weeks, but lower than the amount of Calvinists who did the same (55%). By 2009, only 24% of Muslims in the Netherlands attended mosque once a week. A 2004 study found that the importance of Islam in the lives of Dutch Muslims, particularly of second-generation immigrants was decreasing. This observation was based on the reducing participation of younger Muslims in Islamic rituals, organizations, and prayer. The study also predicted that the trend would continue with increasing education and \\"individualization\\". However, the study also found that second-generation immigrants attached more importance to religion that the first generation as an \\"individual experience.\\" The study concluded \\"the expression of religiosity by Muslim youth was not much different to that of their Dutch Christian or Jewish peers\\". According to a 2011 survey, roughly 60% of Muslim women of Moroccan or Turkish origin wear a headscarf. The most common reasons cited for wearing a headscarf was \\"religious obligation\\" following by \\"cultural tradition.\\" On the other hand, the wearing of full veils is incredibly rare, with an estimated less than 500 Muslim women in the country choosing to don a niqab or burqa. Of the women who do wear full-face veils, 60% of them are converts to Islam. On August 1 2019, a ban on face coverings was implemented, making a full veil illegal on public transport and in schools, hospitals and government buildings. It does not apply to public streets. Politics Muslims are slightly less likely to vote in elections than non-Muslims at a rate of 69% compared to 77%, respectively. The most popular party among Muslims, is Denk. After the 2003 elections, there were at least ten MPs from Muslim background among the 150 Members of Parliament, but as few as three among them may have been active believers, while two explicitly classified themselves as ex-Muslims. Muslims in the Netherlands are more likely to be active in municipal and national politics by means of demonstrations, petitions, contacting media outlets and attending meetings than running for office. Nebahat Albayrak (ex-State Secretary of Justice) and Ahmed Aboutaleb (ex-State Secretary of Social Affairs and Employment, now mayor of Rotterdam) were both the first Muslims in the Dutch cabinet. Geert Wilders of the Dutch Party for Freedom was put on trial for inciting racial hatred, relating to his inflammatory comments regarding Islam in early October 2010. Wilders was acquitted on June 23, 2011, the judge citing that his comments were legitimate political debate, but on the edge of legal acceptability. Of the 475 mosques in the Netherlands in 2018, a plurality (146) are controlled by the Turkish Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet). Diyanet implements the political ideology of the Turkish AKP party and employ imams trained in Turkey. Critics of the Diyanet imams, some of whom do not speak Dutch, hinder the effective integration of Dutch-Turkish Muslims into the society of the Netherlands by promoting allegiance to the Turkish state while neglecting to promote loyalty to the Dutch state. The Diyanet has facilitated a fusion of religion and politics (Islamism) in the Netherlands and allowed the AKP-associated party DENK to spread propaganda in mosques under its control located in the Netherlands. When Turkish migrant organizations were requested to join a statement against domestic violence, the religious attaché of the Turkish Embassy declared that domestic violence does not exist in Turkish society and all Turkish Islamic organizations withdrew their support from the statement.  Controversies  A mosque in The Hague The murder of Theo van Gogh by Mohammed Bouyeri, a Dutch citizen of Moroccan descent, on 2 November 2004, as well as the arrest of the Hofstad Group on charges of terrorism, caused a lot of discussion about Islam and its place in Dutch society. The possibility of banning the burka was discussed in the cabinet. Following the murder of Theo van Gogh, a number of websites appeared praising the murder and making death threats against other people. At the same time, starting with four arson attacks on mosques in the weekend after the murder, a significant number of apparently retaliatory incidents took place. By November 8, Christian churches were in turn targeted. A report for the Anne Frank Foundation and the University of Leiden counted a total of 174 violent incidents in November, specifying that mosques were the target of violence 47 times, and churches 13 times. Between 23 November 2004 and 13 March 2005, the National Dutch Police Services Agency (KLPD) recorded 31 occasions of riots against mosques and Islamic schools. The case that drew most attention was an arson attack that led to the destruction of a Muslim primary school in Uden in December 2004. The period of heightened tensions between native Dutch and Muslim communities was also evidenced by several confrontations between what are known as the \\"Lonsdale Youth\\" (youth groups characterised by their preference for Lonsdale clothing, which is often popular with Neo-Nazi groups) and Turkish and Moroccan youths in provincial towns like Venray. These incidents took place against the backdrop of increasing suspicions and anger towards Muslims, which have developed over a longer time. In May 2006, a poll by Motivaction / GPD (1,200 Dutch adults +/- 3%) found that 63% of native Dutch citizens felt that Islam is incompatible with modern European life. A poll of June 2004 found that 68% felt threatened by \\"immigrant or Muslim young people\\", 53% feared a terrorist attack by Muslims in the Netherlands, and 47% feared that at some point, they would have to live according to Islamic rules in the Netherlands. Feelings of fear or distrust coincide with a high degree of social segregation. About two-thirds of Turks and Moroccans \\"associate predominantly with members of their own ethnic group,\\" while a similar proportion of native Dutch \\"have little or no contact at all with immigrants.\\" Contacts between the groups are decreasing, notably those between second-generation Turks and Moroccans and native Dutch according to the George Soros-funded Open Society Institute. Dual citizenship When two Muslim politicians, Nebahat Albayrak and Ahmed Aboutaleb, both of whom hold foreign as well as Dutch passports, were proposed as state secretaries in 2007 a discussion was started by the Party for Freedom (PVV) about dual citizenship and the possibility of foreign citizens to hold office. No other political party joined the PVV in their opinion. After their appointment, a motion of no confidence was entered by Geert Wilders, which also did not get any support from any other political party. A week later the PVV entered a motion of no confidence against parliament member Khadija Arib who serves on an advisory council to King Mohammed VI of Morocco; this motion was also defeated without any support from the other parties in parliament. In a country with as many as 2 million residents with dual citizenship, it would prove virtually impossible for any political party to put forward a list of candidates without the odd dual citizen. Even within the PVV itself, the policy failed when party representatives turned out to have Turkish and Israeli passports. Radicalisation Prisons in the Netherlands separates radicalized inmates from the rest of their prison inmates to stop them from radicalizing others. De Schie Prison in Rotterdam has a number of inmates in its seven-cell terrorist section. Of its total 252 inmates, about one-third are Muslim.Researcher Daan Weggemans at Leiden University found that for half the detainees he had studied, imprisonment had a confirmation of their belief that \\"the world is hostile\\". For the other half, imprisonment it had served as a wake-up call and they broke contact with violent jihadist networks. The Parliament of Netherlands voted in 2016 for legislation to strip Dutch citizens who join ISIS or al Qaeda abroad of their citizenship, also if they have not been convicted of any crime. The law can only be applied to individuals with double citizenship. Justice Minister Ard Van der Steur stated the legal changes were necessary to stop jihadists from returning to the Netherlands. In September 2017, four jihadists were stripped of their citizenship. Of the foreign terrorist fighters travelling to Syria or Iraq from the Netherlands, about 40% were female. In 2017, imam Fawaz Jneid received an area ban which barred him from visiting Transvaal and adjacent Schilderswijk, due to having expressed an intolerant message which constituted a threat to national security. Jneid had earlier expressed homophobic views and derogatory comments towards murdered film-maker Theo van Gogh and Islam critic Ayaan Hirsi Ali.  Gulf state funding  In 2018 it was found that at least 30 Islamic organisations in the country had received or requested money from Kuwait or Saudi Arabia, which was controversial due to those countries being linked with Salafism, a fundamentalist movement within Islam.  Discrimination  TNS NIPO, a Dutch research and polling agency, observed an increase in anti-Muslim sentiment after the September 11 attacks, but claimed unfavorable views of Muslims were already high in the country prior to the attacks. According to research by Ineke van der Valk, an author and researcher at the University of Amsterdam, a third of mosques in the Netherlands have experienced at least one incident of vandalism, threatening letters, attempted arson, or other aggressive actions in the past 10 years. In February 2016, five men threw two Molotov cocktails at a mosque. Some 30 people, including children, were inside the mosque at the time but no one was injured. Dutch courts called it a \\"terrorist act.\\" In December of the same year, a building linked to the Association of Islamic Communities was set on fire. Police suspected it was a hate crime. Muslim students have more difficulties finding internships for vocational training. This discrimination is more present towards female students wearing a headscarfs. According to the George-Soros-funded Open Society Institute, after the murder of Theo van Gogh in November 2004, Minister of Integration and Immigration Rita Verdonk commissioned an inquiry into the radicalisation of young Muslims. The conclusion was that many of them experience alienation, feeling disconnected with both their first-generation immigrant parents and from Dutch society. Previous reports had already found that young Muslims don't share the deep ethno-national attachment their parents feel with their country of origin, and instead are coming to identify primarily with their religion. While they participate less in religious activities than their parents, they more strongly link their identity with Islam and with the global Muslim community; radical and orthodox Islamic groups offer some of these young Muslims clear answers and a firm sense of belonging. While prior research found that the degree of religiosity in general decreases among Muslims with higher education and stable employment, the new report noted that highly educated young Muslims can also experience \\"relative deprivation\\" all the more strongly - the sense that despite their efforts they receive fewer opportunities than native Dutch people of the same generation - and turn to radicalism in anger and frustration. The Party for Freedom, and its leader Geert Wilders, advocate for policies that critics say discriminate against Muslims including banning the Qur'an, taxing the hijab, shutting down all mosques in the Netherlands, and disallowing further immigration of Muslims to the country. Wilders and other PVV maintain their policies are not bigoted towards Muslims, but rather are aimed at the religion of Islam. After the 2017 Dutch election, the party had 20 seats in the Dutch House of Representatives, which is equivalent to 13.1%. On 29 November 2016, a majority in the Dutch House of Representatives voted to partially prohibit face-covering attire such as the niqab. Critics of the law stated that it was motivated by anti-Muslim sentiment but advocates of the law maintain it was not directed towards Muslims in particular. The political parties GroenLinks, Democrats 66 and DENK voted against the law. Opposition to discrimination Many organizations in the Netherlands attempt to combat discrimination against Muslims. Some examples include Meld Islamofobie!, the Collective against Islamophobia, SPIOR (a platform organisation of Islamic organisations and mosques in Rotterdam), the Muslim Women organisation Al Nisa, and the Turkish Forum. Following the passage of Executive Order 13769 by U.S. President Donald Trump, protests took place at the Amsterdam Airport Schiphol and in The Hague in solidarity with Muslim refugees.

Signalling, interlocking and track layouts The track was duplicated from Caulfield to Oakleigh in 1883, and to Dandenong in 1891.http://vicsig.net/infrastructure/location/Oakleigh Circa 1910 the station featured two side platforms with an additional centre track.Victorian Railways diagram 18'15 - https://www.victorianrailways.net/photogallery/suburb/oakleigh/oakleigh.html By 1915 a new station building had been constructed to the same style as Box Hill, Essendon, Spotswood and Heidelberg, and a new platform provided on the south side plus a fifth track for engines to run around their consists. By this time the station was controlled by two signal boxes, \\"A\\" at the city end controlling the Warrigal Road level crossing and interlocked gates, and \\"B\\" between the station and yard controlling the latter.https://www.victorianrailways.net/signaling/completedia/oakleigh1915.gif In March 1922 electrification was extended from Caulfield to Oakleigh, and this was extended to Dandenong during December of the same year. The Hanover Street bridge was built across the Dandenong end of the goods yard in 1925, and by 1928 the fifth track (along the south side of the station) had been lifted.Victorian Railways diagram 16'28 - https://www.victorianrailways.net/signaling/completedia/oakleigh1915.gif Three-position signalling was extended from Caulfield to the city end of Oakleigh (exclusive) in December 1940.https://www.victorianrailways.net/signaling/completedia/canegie_oakleigh1940.jpg Around 1966 the Warrigal Road level crossing was closed and, in conjunction with demolition of shops, a new road overpass was provided. The original Warrigal Road surface was partially retained as a slip lane to serve a handful of shops along the western boundary. The road bridge piers were spaced to allow extension of the track from the southernmost platform in the citybound direction. In 1975 the track layout was drastically simplified and both signal boxes were abolished and demolished, being replaced with a new, experimental route-setting power interlocking system situated in the middle of the southern station building. In lieu of the older system with individual buttons for each signal and turnout or crossover, the panel used custom circuit boards and a button arrangement where the operator would select a route between any two signals, and that route would be requested, set and locked by the relay interlocking if available. The new signal panel included a \\"switch out\\" feature allowing the station's signalling to operate automatically in lesser- traffic periods. To facilitate this the island platform was used for most trains, with high-speed (65 km/h) turnouts provided either end to avoid trains slowing down significantly for the diverging movements. In busier periods the signal panel was switched in by station staff, to permit access to or from the goods yard, terminating moves from the city, or overtaking moves in either direction. The goods yard was officially closed to traffic in May 1984 with the exception of briquette traffic, which was still being received. Way and Works wagon HD205, which had been parked at the city end of the through siding for years, was transferred to the Caulfield depot on Friday 22 June 1984.Newsrail August 1984 p.245 By October that year the briquette traffic had also shifted to Westall. The overhead in Siding A was removed by December of the same year, along with the points and the majority of the sidings. In March 1987 a guards' indicator light was provided for signal post 16, controlling citybound moves from Platform 1. As of April 1988, suburban timetables specified an overtaking move between outbound suburban and country trains, where the 16:53 and 17:36 departures from Flinders Street to Dandenong were each scheduled to wait 3 minutes at Oakleigh for a Traralgon and Warragul service respectively. When the Cranbourne line was electrified in 1995, trains that had previously terminated at Oakleigh were extended and the passenger sidings fell into disuse. The extended goods siding was along the north side fell out of use and was abolished around the same time, although the shell of the citybound dwarf signal at the down end remained in situ until 2018. As a result, the signal panel was generally only used when the underpass flooded, as all trains in both directions could be diverted to the north-side platform (by then renamed Platform 3). The suburban sidings were restored to service in late 2004, but only used occasionally after that with further periods out of service. While the panel was switched out, express trains through Oakleigh were assumed to run express through Hughesdale, Murrumbeena and Carnegie as well, and given altered level crossing timings; while the panel was switched in this selection had to be made manually. After the Siemens trains experienced braking issues in the mid-2000s, all trains were required to be sent through as express trains. This gave additional boom barrier downtime, but provided a safety margin in case of brake failure.Weekly Operational Notice 19/2007, SW.118/2007 The signal panel was abolished on 29 May 2018, with the last train passing through by 9:02pm. From that point the panel power supply was severed, and all tracks and signals removed. New tracks were laid approaching platforms 2 and 3 (renamed 1 and 2), but the former Platform 1 had temporary fencing erected along the edge and track has not been reinstated. A few months later the tracks in the platform pit were replaced. Signalling is now controlled from Dandenong. The signal panel was removed on Thursday 27 June 2019 and transported to the Australian Railway Historical Society for preservation. Incidents On 8 May 1981 a train entering service from Oakleigh sidings derailed, blocking the morning peak hour services. This trapped the following school train from Moe, so a Harris train was run \\"wrong line\\" (backwards relative to normal procedures) and parked parallel, with students transferring carefully between the two.Newsrail July 1981 p.161 A similar incident occurred on 26 Jan 1982, as a train exiting Siding C passed signal 38 at Clear Low Speed but 30 at Danger, derailing on the catch points and obstructing the citybound track from around 9am.https://www.victorianrailways.net/photogallery/suburb/oakleigh/oakleigh.html The train was rerailed by 5:30pm, but one of the cranes used in the operation became bogged while exiting the worksite.Newsrail March 1982 p.46 Due to an industrial dispute, the Overland train was stabled in Oakleigh on Friday 4 December 1981.Newsrail March 1982 p.42 Platforms & services On the northern side of the railway line on Portman St, there is a bus interchange.

The Company also built the loop branch line connecting the Brighton line to the Melbourne to St Kilda line, which was opened in 1857. Trains from Melbourne travelled to the St Kilda terminus, and then \\"backed out\\" onto the loop line to Windsor. The loop was constructed on wooden trestles across the swampy ground now known as the Albert Park Lake, and included a raised embankment with a bridgehttp://www.stonnington.vic.gov.au/library/praimage/09/9303.jpg over St Kilda Road. The first train on the loop ran on 3 December 1859, and the line opened to the public ten days later. There were no trains after 7pm on the branch line; patrons had to walk to their homes in Prahran from St Kilda station in Fitzroy Street. A short time after the loop line was constructed, a direct connection was built between South Yarra and Windsor stations, the first train arriving at Windsor directly from Melbourne on 24 November 1860. The loop line to St Kilda soon fell into disuse, and track duplication, a condition of the original crown lease, was never completed. Sidings The St Kilda and Brighton Railway Company experienced financial difficulties and was bought by the Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company in 1862. The track, bridge and trestles between St Kilda station and Punt Road were dismantled; however, a siding from Windsor to Hoddle Street remained. Due to the track alignments there were now two level crossings within 100 metres on Union Street, as the siding continued to be used for shunting trains from the Brighton line, and to carry screenings from the Richmond quarries to a commercial depot on Punt Road (then known as Hoddle Street). Perversely, it was due to local annoyance at the siding level crossing near the station, that trains won the legal right-of-way at road-rail intersections in Victoria. Indignant at the delays to horse-drawn traffic caused by trains, and in particular the perpetually closed and unmanned crossing of the siding, one morning in 1869, local councillors from Prahran marched to the level crossing in question with a group of workers who then began to rip up the tracks on the siding. The matter was later brought to court on 17 April 1869, although the railways won the right-of-way case, the siding was not reconstructed. No evidence of the bridge over St Kilda Road or embankments remain, although the alignment of the loop can be traced by the residual parkland and some oddly- shaped property boundaries. A small park to the west of Windsor station is called \\"Windsor Siding\\". 1887 accident On the evening of 11 May 1887, an express train crashed into the rear of a stopping train between Prahran and Windsor stations. Four people were killed and over 100 severely injured. The stopping train had been halted short of Windsor station by a signal. When the signal to proceed was given, the driver could not release the brakes on his train due to a ruptured air pipe. An express train from Melbourne was scheduled 10 minutes behind the stopping train and, due to a curve in the track and a deep cutting, the crew of the express could not see the stationary train ahead. Cooper (1924) reported that the noise of the impact could be heard throughout Prahran and that, in a short time, over 10,000 people were gathered at the site. The driver of the Brighton express, Frederick William Maskell, was killed, along with his fireman, James Houston McNab, William Runting, aged 21, and Annie Foster, aged 45, of Colac. Only weeks earlier, Maskell had received a special reward of £5 from the Railways Commissioners for his alertness in averting an accident after another driver had disregarded a signal.

The company and network was taken over by the Government of Victoria in 1878 to become part of Victorian Railways.

In humans it is encoded by the ADIPOQ gene and it is produced in primarily in adipose tissue, but also in muscle, and even in the brain.  Structure  Adiponectin is a 244-amino-acid-long polypeptide (protein). There are four distinct regions of adiponectin. The first is a short signal sequence that targets the hormone for secretion outside the cell; next is a short region that varies between species; the third is a 65-amino acid region with similarity to collagenous proteins; the last is a globular domain. Overall this protein shows similarity to the complement 1Q factors (C1Q). However, when the 3-dimensional structure of the globular region was determined, a striking similarity to TNFα was observed, despite unrelated protein sequences.  Function  Adiponectin is a protein hormone that modulates a number of metabolic processes, including glucose regulation and fatty acid oxidation. Adiponectin is secreted from adipose tissue (and also from the placenta in pregnancy) into the bloodstream and is very abundant in plasma relative to many hormones. Many studies have found adiponectin to be inversely correlated with body mass index in patient populations. However, a meta analysis was not able to confirm this association in healthy adults. Circulating adiponectin concentrations increase during caloric restriction in animals and humans, such as in patients with anorexia nervosa. This observation is surprising, given that adiponectin is produced by adipose tissue. However, a recent study suggests that adipose tissue within bone marrow, which increases during caloric restriction, contributes to elevated circulating adiponectin in this context. Transgenic mice with increased adiponectin show reduced adipocyte differentiation and increased energy expenditure associated with mitochondrial uncoupling. The hormone plays a role in the suppression of the metabolic derangements that may result in type 2 diabetes, obesity, atherosclerosis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and an independent risk factor for metabolic syndrome. Adiponectin in combination with leptin has been shown to completely reverse insulin resistance in mice. Adiponectin is secreted into the bloodstream where it accounts for approximately 0.01% of all plasma protein at around 5-10 μg/mL (mg/L). In adults, plasma concentrations are higher in females than males, and are reduced in diabetics compared to non-diabetics. Weight reduction significantly increases circulating concentrations. Adiponectin automatically self-associates into larger structures. Initially, three adiponectin molecules bind together to form a homotrimer. The trimers continue to self-associate and form hexamers or dodecamers. Like the plasma concentration, the relative levels of the higher-order structures are sexually dimorphic, where females have increased proportions of the high-molecular weight forms. Recent studies showed that the high-molecular weight form may be the most biologically active form regarding glucose homeostasis. High-molecular-weight adiponectin was further found to be associated with a lower risk of diabetes with similar magnitude of association as total adiponectin. However, coronary artery disease has been found to be positively associated with high molecular weight adiponectin, but not with low molecular weight adiponectin. Adiponectin exerts some of its weight reduction effects via the brain. This is similar to the action of leptin; adiponectin and leptin can act synergistically. Adiponectin promoted synaptic and memory function in the brain. Humans with lower levels of adiponectin have reduced cognitive function.  Receptors  Adiponectin binds to a number of receptors. So far, two receptors have been identified with homology to G protein-coupled receptors, and one receptor similar to the cadherin family: * Adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) * Adiponectin receptor 2 (AdipoR2) * T-cadherin - CDH13 These have distinct tissue specificities within the body and have different affinities to the various forms of adiponectin. AdipoR1 is enriched in skeletal muscle, whereas AdipoR2 is enriched in liver. Six months of exercise has been shown in rats to double muscle AdipoR1. The receptors affect the downstream target AMP kinase, an important cellular metabolic rate control point. Expression of the receptors is correlated with insulin levels, as well as reduced in mouse models of diabetes, particularly in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. In 2016, the University of Tokyo announced it was launching an investigation into anonymously made claims of fabricated and falsified data on the identification of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2.University of Tokyo to investigate data manipulation charges against six prominent research groups ScienceInsider, Dennis Normile, Sep 20, 2016  Discovery  Adiponectin was first characterised in 1995 in differentiating 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Scherer PE et al.). In 1996 it was characterised in mice as the mRNA transcript most highly expressed in adipocytes. In 2007, adiponectin was identified as a transcript highly expressed in preadipocytes (precursors of fat cells) differentiating into adipocytes. The human homologue was identified as the most abundant transcript in adipose tissue. Contrary to expectations, despite being produced in adipose tissue, adiponectin was found to be decreased in obesity. This downregulation has not been fully explained. The gene was localised to chromosome 3q27, a region highlighted as affecting genetic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes and obesity. Supplementation by differing forms of adiponectin was able to improve insulin control, blood glucose and triglyceride levels in mouse models. The gene was investigated for variants that predispose to type 2 diabetes. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms in the coding region and surrounding sequence were identified from several different populations, with varying prevalences, degrees of association and strength of effect on type 2 diabetes. Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid, has been shown to increase adiponectin expression, which partly explains its beneficial effects on metabolic disturbances. Mice fed the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have shown increased plasma adiponectin. Curcumin, capsaicin, gingerol, and catechins have also been found to increase adiponectin expression. Phylogenetic distribution includes expression in birds and fish.  Metabolic Adiponectin effects: * glucose flux ** decreased gluconeogenesis ** increased glucose uptake * lipid catabolism ** β-oxidation ** triglyceride clearance * protection from endothelial dysfunction (important facet of atherosclerotic formation) * insulin sensitivity * weight loss * control of energy metabolism. * upregulation of uncoupling proteins * reduction of TNF-alpha * promotion of reverse cholesterol transport Regulation of adiponectin * Obesity is associated with decreased adiponectin. **The exact mechanism of regulation is unknown, but adiponectin could be regulated by post-translational mechanisms in cells.  Hypoadiponectinemia  A low level of adiponectin is an independent risk factor for developing: *Metabolic syndrome *Diabetes mellitus  Other  Lower levels of adiponectin are associated with ADHD in adults. Adiponectin levels were found to be increased in rheumatoid arthritis patients responding to DMARDs or TNF inhibitor therapy. Exercise induced release of adiponectin increased hippocampal growth and led to antidepressive symptoms in mice.  As a medication target  Circulating levels of adiponectin can indirectly be increased through lifestyle modifications and certain medications such as statins. A small molecule adiponectin receptor AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 agonist, AdipoRon, has been reported. In 2016, the University of Tokyo announced it was launching an investigation into anonymously made claims of fabricated and falsified data on AdipoR1, AdipoR2, and AdipoRon. Extracts of sweet potatoes have been reported to increase levels of adiponectin and thereby improve glycemic control in humans. However, a systematic review concluded there is insufficient evidence to support the consumption of sweet potatoes to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. Adiponectin is apparently able to cross the blood-brain-barrier. However, conflicting data on this issue exist. Adiponectin has a half-life of 2.5 hours in humans.

It serves the eastern Melbourne suburb of Camberwell, and opened as Hartwell Hill on 7 May 1906, being renamed Hartwell on 1 August 1909.Hartwell Vicsig Hartwell was originally served by a train consisting of a locomotive and one or two carriages, dubbed the Deepdene Dasher, which shuttled between Ashburton and Deepdene stations. After the line from Camberwell to Ashburton was electrified in 1924, Hartwell was served by electric trains on the Ashburton line, which was extended to Alamein in 1948. Hartwell is named after one of the early estates in the area, \\"Hartwell House\\", the residence of James Irwin, who, in the mid-1850s, owned and operated Irwin's Hotel, located on the corner of Norwood (now Toorak) and Wattle Valley roads, and which was demolished about the time the railway line was built. In the 1850s, Hartwell was a small hamlet known as \\"Back Creek\\", named after the nearby creek. Minutes of meetings of the Boroondara District Roads Board noted that \\"c/- Irwin Hotel, Back Creek\\" was used as a polling station. The station building was originally at Walhalla station, the terminus of the Walhalla line, but was moved to Hartwell in December 1938, six years before the Walhalla line closed in 1944. Hartwell is the only station on the Alamein branch to have an island platform.

ASB Bank, commonly stylised as ASB, is a bank owned by Commonwealth Bank of Australia, operating in New Zealand. It provides a range of financial services including retail, business and rural banking, funds management, as well as insurance through its Sovereign Limited subsidiary, and investment and securities services through its ASB Group Investments and ASB Securities divisions. ASB also operates BankDirect, a branchless banking service that provides service via phone, Internet, EFTPOS and ATMs only. History ASB was established in 1847 as the Auckland Savings Bank. The first meeting was held in the store of Campbell and Brown, and was attended by John Logan Campbell, Dr John Johnson, Rev Thomas Buddle, John Jermyn Symonds, John MacDougall, David Graham (a brother of Robert Graham), Robert Appleyard Fitzgerald, Thomas Forsaith, John Israel Montefiore, James Dilworth, Alexander Kennedy, and William Smellie Graham. During the 1980s the association of savings banks amalgamated the local savings banks throughout New Zealand with ASB at their head, and adopted the name, ASB Trust Bank. In 1986, ASB withdrew from the Trust Bank and in 1987 became a full-fledged commercial bank under the name, ASB Bank. In 1988, the Government passed the Trustee Banks Restructuring Act, which enabled ASB to become a public company. In 1989, the owner of the bank, ASB Community Trust, sold 75% of the shares to Commonwealth Bank. In 1994, ASB purchased and amalgamated Westland Bank, another former savings bank, located on the South Island's west coast, which enabled it to operate on a truly national basis. In 1999, ASB Group acquired Sovereign Limited, a life insurance company, and the retail stockbroking and fixed income operations of Warburg Dillon Read. In 2000, Commonwealth Bank bought the remaining 25% of ASB's shares from the Trust. In 2005 the bank changed the ASB Bank brand to ASB to reflect the more integrated financial services provider that it had become. In early July 2020, ASB announced that it would be closing nine branches while 25 branches would be moving to three day weeks due to a shift in demand for online services. The company will also hire 150 additional staff to provide specialist online support. Innovation ASB has a reputation for innovation and embracing new technologies. The bank has won numerous awards including NetGuide Award for best financial services site in 2006 and 2007, TUANZ Innovation Award for Financial Service in 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2005, and recently Canstar's inaugural annual 'Best Online Banking Award' in 2012. ASB launched pago in November 2006, which is an electronic payment service that allows anyone with a New Zealand bank account to send cleared funds via mobile phone or the internet to another person or participating retailer in real-time. The technology has not succeeded in the way ASB hoped, with very little use and virtually no significant updates since 2010. ASB Securities, launched in 1999, remains the largest online broker in New Zealand in terms of trading volume and active customers The bank has found significant success by being the first to introduce innovative services and features to the New Zealand market. ASB was the first bank in New Zealand to offer: * internet banking (FastNet Classic in 1997) * branches open seven days a week (1998) * online share trading on both the Australian and New Zealand share-markets (via ASB Securities in 1999) * banking via mobile phones (ASB Mobile in 1999) * the ability for customers to stop receiving their paper statements (2003) * banking via PDAs and browser-based mobile banking (2006) * automatic rounding of transactions where the difference is put into a savings account (Save the Change in 2010) * Facebook friend payments via ASB Mobile iOS, Android and Windows Phone apps (2012) * a dedicated real estate app for iOS (ASB Property Guide in 2012) Advertising and sponsorship Previous ASB logo Previous ASB logo Previous ASB logo ASB has become known for using well- known characters in its advertising. The bank had a series of highly successful, award-winning commercials with the Ira Goldstein character (played by American actor Steve Mellor), a bumbling American banker sent to New Zealand to find out \\"what makes that bank different\\". The ads were popular over an 11-year period. However, the campaign ended in 2010 as the bank moved to a new advertising agency from TBWA/Whybin. In October 2011 the bank introduced the Experience ASB campaign with new advertising agency Droga5. The campaign featured voice overs by English actor Dame Judi Dench and allowed potential customers to \\"test drive\\" the bank before joining. In July 2012 ASB left Droga5 for Saatchi & Saatchi. In February 2013 ASB launched a new advertising campaign featuring Brian Blessed playing a fictionalised version of himself encouraging New Zealanders to be proud of their achievements whether big or small. The bank also supports the ASB Community Trust, which was formed in 1988 with an endowment from the sale of ASB to Australia's Commonwealth Bank. The Trust has distributed more than $745 million since 1988, mostly giving grants to the arts, sport, recreation, environment, heritage, health and social services areas, as well as funding capital projects in local communities around New Zealand. ASB is the corporate sponsor for a number of high-profile New Zealand organisations and events such as: * Coastguard New Zealand * St John New Zealand * Starship Foundation * New Zealand Football - including the ASB Premiership, ASB Chatham Cup, ASB National Woman's League, ASB Woman's Knockout Cup and the ASB National Youth League. * Tennis - including the ASB Classic, Auckland Tennis, Canterbury Tennis and Tennis South Canterbury. * ASB Gardens Magic - A series of summer concerts held in Wellington. * ASB Classical Sparks - An annual concert in Christchurch's Hagley Park which attracts an audience of over 120,000. * ASB Polyfest - A four-day event in Auckland featuring over 9,000 student performers celebrating the culture of the Pacific and attracting an audience of over 90,000.

Developed in 1988 by American Evan Whildin of Action Arms, the .50 AE is one of the most powerful pistol cartridges in production. Overview The Arcadia Machine and Tool AMT Automag V was the first handgun chambered for the .50 AE. The actual cartridge has a .547 inch (13.9 mm) diameter base, with a rebated rim. The rim diameter of the .50 AE is the same as the .44 Remington Magnum cartridge. A Mark XIX Desert Eagle in .50 AE can be converted to .44 with nothing more than a barrel and magazine change. The introduction of the .50AE in the US was met with a rocky start. US laws state that non-sporting firearms may not be over 0.500\\" in bore diameter (measured land to land) to meet Title I regulations. The original .50 Action Express bore diameter was .510\\" with conventional rifling, but the switch to polygonal rifling on production Desert Eagles allowed the gauge plug to drop through, rendering the gun a destructive device under Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) regulations. Nominal bullet diameter was reduced to the current 0.500 inch (12.7 mm) rather than the original .510\\"Taffin, John (2005),The Desert Eagle of Magnum Research.Guns Magazine – thus the noticeably tapered case. Loaded .50 AE ammunition is currently available from CCI Ammunition, Speer, Hornady, and IMI with the latter ammunition being imported into the US by Magnum Research under the \\"Samson Ultra\\" trademark. Fired from a standard six-inch Desert Eagle barrel, Speer's 300-grain load produces a muzzle velocity of over 1,500 ft/s, giving a muzzle energy of over . Fired from a 10-inch barrel, the same load produces a muzzle velocity of over 1,600 ft/s, giving a muzzle energy of nearly . Recoil of the .50 AE in the Desert Eagle pistol is substantial, although only marginally more severe than the .44 Magnum, as the auto mechanism and weight of the gun smooth the recoil somewhat. Other firearms chambered for the .50 AE include the AMT AutoMag V the LAR Grizzly Win Mag and the Freedoms Arms Model 555. Performance Box of Hornady .50 AE 300-grain jacketed hollow point ammunition SAAMI specifies a maximum chamber pressure of 36,000 psi (248 MPa) for the .50 AE. Available factory loads can produce nearly 1,800 ft·lbf (2440 J) of muzzle energy. New, unprimed brass is available from Starline. Bullets are available from a few manufacturers. Many of the bullets designed for the .500 S&W; Magnum are too long for use in .50 AE semi-automatic pistols. At 91.4 m (100 yards), the .50AE has more than double the energy of a standard .45 ACP round at the muzzle. Use Like other handgun cartridges of such magnitude, the principal uses of the .50 AE are metallic silhouette shooting and medium/big game hunting. Like the .44 Magnum, .454 Casull, .460 S&W; Magnum, and .500 S&W; Magnum, it is also well suited for defense against large predators, such as bears. Wildcats The cartridge is the parent case for the .440 Cor-Bon (1998) by Cor-Bon and .429 DE (2018) by Magnum Research (a division of Kahr Firearms Group). Though similar, they are not interchangeable. Desert Eagle magazines chambered for .50 Action Express can feed the derivative cartridges but need to use a barrel bored for 0.429 caliber [10.89-mm] (.44 Magnum).

Originally named Braybrook Junction for the convergence of the major railways from central Melbourne to Ballarat and Bendigo, it was renamed when the suburb of Sunshine, which it serves, took its name from the nearby Sunshine Harvester Works. With the expansion of the railway network in Melbourne's west, Sunshine grew in importance, with cross-suburban goods routes constructed to Newport and from the adjacent Albion to Jacana line. From the mid-20th century it became an interchange for the main interstate routes to South Australia and New South Wales when the through line from Melbourne to Sydney was completed, although the main line to Adelaide was later diverted. In the early 21st century, the station was demolished and reconstructed to serve the diversion of the main passenger route to Geelong and beyond. It has been identified as a possible route for a future line to Melbourne Airport and as an interchange for the orbital Suburban Rail Loop. Today, Sunshine is served by Metro Trains services on the Sunbury line, and V/Line services on the Geelong and Ballarat lines. Bendigo services and freight trains to northern Victoria and towards Sydney also pass through the station. A large bus interchange at the station is a hub for surrounding suburbs. History Sunshine station opened on 7 September 1885 as Braybrook Junction. It was renamed Sunshine on 15 July 1907.Sunshine Vicsig 19th century The Melbourne & Murray River Railway (now named the Bendigo line), originating from Spencer Street station, was built in the late 1850s, from Footscray station to Sunbury and Bendigo, however, no station was built at that time on the current site; the closest station was Albion & Darlington, on the site of the current Albion station.Brimbank City Council - Travelling: Roads, Railways and Bridges In 1885, the Serviceton line from Melbourne to Ballarat, via Bacchus Marsh, was built, branching off from the Bendigo line, and a station at the junction of the two lines was built. The station opened on 7 September 1885, as Braybrook Junction, named such as it was at the junction of the two lines, and was within the Shire of Braybrook. In 1887, the Sunshine – Newport line, connecting the new station at Braybrook Junction to Newport and Williamstown, Victoria's major cargo port at the time, was opened.  20th century  In 1907, Braybrook Junction station was renamed Sunshine, when Hugh McKay moved his Sunshine Harvester Works adjacent to the station. On 20 April 1908, Sunshine was the scene of the worst train crash in Victorian railway history, the Sunshine train disaster. The Albion – Jacana line opened in 1929, connecting Sunshine station with the North East line, allowing freight trains to avoid the steeper grades and suburban traffic on the suburban line between North Melbourne, Essendon and Broadmeadows. The road level crossing at Sunshine was removed when grade separation was carried out in 1961. The works took place as part of the project to construct a standard gauge line from Sydney to Melbourne. Boom barriers were provided at the nearby former Anderson Road level crossing, on the Bendigo line, in the same year. A fourth platform was opened in January 1963, on the adjacent Melbourne – Sydney standard gauge line, to enable passengers to transfer between the interstate Sydney and Adelaide expresses. In 1965, control of signals at Albion station was transferred to the signal box at Sunshine. Boom barriers were provided at the nearby former Anderson Road level crossing, on the Ballarat line, in 1977. On 5 February 1985, Harris trailer carriage 830T was destroyed by fire, in a vandalism attack, whist stabled in the former down siding. The sidings leading to Massey Ferguson were booked out of use in 1988, with the lead to the sidings, which crossed the standard gauge line, was removed in February of the same year. The former station underpass, which connected the platforms to nearby City Place, was completed in 1994, replacing an earlier underpass. It was removed during the station upgrades between 2012-2014. Also around this time, the track leading to the former goods shed was removed. Sunshine was categorised as a Premium station on 26 July 1996.  21st century  From 2012-2014, the station was rebuilt as part of the Regional Rail Link project.Sunshine railway station Regional Rail Link Works included: *a new bus interchange, completed in September 2013;Sunshine bus interchange Regional Rail Link *construction of a new footbridge and concourse, completed in January 2014;Commuters have new concourse at Sunshine The Courier 3 January 2014 *upgrading Platforms 1 and 2 with new canopies; *rebuilding Platform 3 and a new Platform 4, both completed in April 2014;Ballarat services now stopping at new, dedicated platforms at Sunshine station Premier of Victoria 28 April 2014 Retrieved 03-05-2014\\"Ballarat services now stopping at new, dedicated platforms at Sunshine station\\" Railway Digest June 2014 page 21 The completed station was opened to the public on 28 April 2014. The standalone signal box to the north of the station, commissioned in 1914, was closed in 2016 and its control of the Sunshine and Albion areas transferred to Metrol. Construction commenced in early 2020 on a new signal control centre south of the station, which will share control of the Sunshine–Dandenong corridor with an existing facility at Dandenong after completion of the Metro Tunnel. On July 22, 2018, the Victorian state government announced that the Melbourne Airport rail link will be funded with state and commonwealth money and that it will run from the Melbourne CBD to Melbourne Airport via Sunshine station. As part of this project, a new \\"super hub\\" will be built at Sunshine station for passengers transferring between V/Line services and the airport trains. Construction is planned to begin by 2022.

This situation was resolved by 1898 when a second crossover was added, and by 1899 three non-interlocked signals had been provided in each direction, with the first proper signal box brought into use on 17 June 1901. Later the steam era trains operated hourly from Flinders Street to Braybrook Junction, with only eight trains continuing to St Albans. The station was made the terminus of the electrified network from the city in October 1921, and services were improved, with trains running every 40 minutes by day and hourly at night. The original station was located at the northern end of the Main Road level crossing, with all terminating electric trains using Platform 2. In 1959 the station was rebuilt, with an island platform built on the southern side of the level crossing. One side faced the main line, with the other side formed a dock platform for terminating suburban trains.

Ambani took Reliance public in 1977 and was worth $25.6 billion upon his death. In 2016, he was honored posthumously with the Padma Vibhushan, India's second highest civilian honour for his contributions to trade and industry. Early career Dhirubhai Ambani was one of the sons of Hirachand Gordhanbhai Ambani, a village school teacher belonging to the Modh Baniya community and Jamnaben Ambani and was born in Chorwad, Junagadh district, Gujarat on 28 December, 1932. He did his studies from Bahadur Kanji school. In his youth, he joined the protests against the Nawab of Junagarh and organized many actions against the Nawab's plans to join Pakistan after independence. In 1948, he left for the Port of Aden to work for A. Besse and Co. along with his brother Ramnikbhai. He later came to sell shell and Burmah oil products for the company. There is a famous story about how he once made a lot of money by melting the silver bullion and selling it as pure silver because he knew that the value of pure silver was much higher than the bullion thus was a precursor to his financial wizardry and acumen. His friends described him as someone who was affable yet ambitious, cheerful yet had a 'dark side' because of his extreme ambition and risk taking. In Aden, his first son, Mukesh was born to him in 1957. Another son, Anil, was born two years later in 1959. He left Aden in 1958 to try his hand at his own business in India in the textiles market .

Arabnews.com (2 November 2012). Retrieved 28 July 2013. who lived with him in Yemen. Majin was to import polyester yarn and export spices to Yemen. The first office of the Reliance Commercial Corporation was set up at the Narsinatha Street in Masjid Bunder. It was a room with a telephone, one table and three chairs. Initially, they had two assistants to help them with their business. At the tiny office, he began to make a team that would stay with Reliance for years, which includes Rasikbhai Meswani (his nephew), Ramnikbhai, Nathubhai (his younger brother) and two former schoolmates named Rathibhai Mucchala and Narottambhai Joshi. They usually worked around the streets of Pydhonie. During this period, Ambani and his family stayed in a two-bedroom apartment at the Jai Hind Estate in Bhuleshwar, Mumbai. In 1965, Champaklal Damani and Dhirubhai Ambani ended their partnership and Ambani started on his own. It is believed that both had different temperaments and a different take on how to conduct business. While Damani was a cautious trader and did not believe in building yarn inventories, Ambani was a known risk-taker and believed in building inventories to increase profit. In 1966 he formed Reliance Commercial Corporation which later became Reliance Industries on 08 May 1973. He launched the brand 'vimal' during this time which sold polyester materials for saris, shawls, suits and dresses. Ambani's control over stock exchange Extensive marketing of the brand in the interiors of India made it a household name. Franchise retail outlets were started and they sold the \\"Only Vimal\\" brand of textiles. In the year 1975, a technical team from the World Bank visited the 'Reliance Textiles' Manufacturing unit. In 1988, Reliance Industries came up against a rights issue regarding partly convertible debentures. It was rumoured that the company was making all efforts to ensure that their stock prices did not slide an inch. Sensing an opportunity, The Bear Cartel, a group of stock brokers from Calcutta, started to short sell the shares of Reliance. To counter this, a group of stock brokers until recently referred to as \\"Friends of Reliance\\" started to buy the short sold shares of Reliance Industries on the Bombay Stock Exchange. The Bear Cartel was acting on the belief that the Bulls would be short of cash to complete the transactions and would be ready for settlement under the \\"Badla\\" trading system operative in the Bombay Stock Exchange. The bulls kept buying and a price of 152 per share was maintained until the day of settlement. On the day of settlement, the Bear Cartel was taken aback when the Bulls demanded a physical delivery of shares. To complete the transaction, much money was provided to the stock brokers who had bought shares of Reliance, by Dhirubhai Ambani. In the case of non-settlement, the Bulls demanded an Unbadla, or penalty sum, of 35 per share. With this, the demand increased and the shares of Reliance shot above 180 in minutes. The settlement caused an enormous uproar in the market. To find a solution to this situation, the Bombay Stock Exchange was closed for three business days. Authorities from the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) intervened in the matter and brought down the \\"Unbadla\\" rate to 2 with a stipulation that the Bear Cartel had to deliver the shares within the next few days. The Bear Cartel bought shares of Reliance from the market at higher price levels and it was also learnt that Dhirubhai Ambani himself supplied those shares to the Bear Cartel and earned a healthy profit out of The Bear Cartel's adventure.Barua, S.K. and Verma, J.S. (1993) The Great Indian Scam, Story of Missing Rs. 40 billion. University of California. . pp. 16–17 After this incident, many questions were raised by his detractors and the press. Not many people were able to understand how a yarn trader until a few years ago was able to get in such a huge amount of cash flow during a crisis period. The answer to this was provided by the then finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee in the Parliament. He informed the house that a Non-Resident Indian had invested up to 220 million in Reliance during 1982–83. These investments were routed through many companies like Crocodile, Lota and Fiasco. These companies were primarily registered in Isle of Man. All the promoters or owners of these companies had a common surname Shah. An investigation by the Reserve Bank of India in the incident did not find any unethical or illegal acts or transactions committed by Reliance or its promoters. Death Ambani was admitted to the Breach Candy Hospital in Mumbai on 24 June 2002 after he suffered a major stroke. It was his second stroke, the first had occurred in February 1986 and had paralyzed his right hand. He was in a coma for more than a week and a number of doctors were consulted. He died on 6 July 2002.Reliance chairman Dhirubhai Ambani dead The Times of India (7 July 2002). Retrieved 28 July 2013. Reliance Industries after Dhirubhai Ambani's death Following his first stroke in 1986, Ambani handed over control of Reliance to his sons, Mukesh and Anil. In November 2004, Mukesh in an interview admitted to having differences with Anil over ownership issues. He also said that the differences \\"are in the private domain\\". After the death of Dhirubhai Ambani, the group was split into Reliance Industries Limited headed by Mukesh, and Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group headed by Anil. As of 2017, the company has more than 250,000 employees. In 2012, Reliance Industries was one of the two Indian companies to be ranked among the top 100 in the Fortune 500 list of the world's largest companies by revenue. In popular media In 1988 an unauthorized biography of Dhirubhai Ambani, by Hamish McDonald with the title The Polyester Prince, outlined all his political and business conquests. The book was not published in India because the Ambanis threatened legal action; an updated version went on sale under the title Ambani and Sons in 2010, and there has been no action against the publisher so far. A Hindi film said to be loosely inspired by the life of Dhirubhai Ambani was released on 12 January 2007. Guru, directed by filmmaker Mani Ratnam, cinematography by Rajiv Menon and music by A.R.Rahman shows the struggle of a man striving to make his mark in the Indian business world with a fictional Shakti Group of Industries.

Early life Born in Norway into a humble family, he paid for his higher education by working at the telegraph office, and a nursery provided by the armed forces that he joined as a recruit. He studied in Bergen where he met Tor Bergeron during a lecture, and was so impressed by his analysis of a 1922 storm that he joined the Bergen School of Meteorology in 1923. In the late 1920s he worked at the Geophysical Institute in Tromsø, northern Norway. Career After school, he remained a weather officer in the Norwegian Air Force until 1939. He went to the US in 1935, lecturing on Norwegian meteorological theories to the US Navy and Caltech. In 1939, he was hired by MIT as head of the meteorology department, and wrote two important books there: Weather analysis and forecasting (1940) and Introduction to Meteorology (1941). With the invasion of Norway, Petterssen returned to Europe and offered his services in England to the Met Office, on loan from the Norwegian Air Force. During World War II, he served as a weather forecaster for bombing raids and special operations. He is most remembered for his work in what has been called the most significant weather forecast in history, the D-Day Forecast, where he contributed significantly to the postponement of D-day by one day. Three groups of meteorologists gave advice to General Dwight Eisenhower, and D-Day was originally planned for 5 June 1944. But he got big trouble with academically untrained competitors, especially from the United States, who believed that the weather was repeated – and had found a weather recurring pattern in the 20s that they felt was positive. And General Dwight D. Eisenhower was relying on his men. \\"Pettersen, which was not always as diplomatic, made it clear that this was nonsense and quasi science but Eisenhower was convinced, and the invasion would take place on 5 June. But at the morning meeting on 4 June Pettersen presented a weather map showing a storm on 5 June. To strong protests from the American quasi- meteorologist, D-Day was postponed.https://www.academia.edu/5899420/Sverre_Petterssen_and_the_contentious_and_momentous_weather_forecasts_for_D- Day The German war fleet was laid in Port: They thought it could not get any invasion because of the storm. But the Norwegian meteorologist knew his meteorology: His analysis showed a 36-hour gap between two storms the morning of 6 June – just enough to make the giant attack with more than 100,000 soldiers, planes, paratroopers and boats.\\"The forecast provided by Sverre Petterssen caused Eisenhower to decide at 0430 on 4 June to postpone D-day to 6 June. Initially it was proposed to postpone the operation to 19 June. The weather on 5 June 1944 On 19 June the worst storm to date in the century struck the English channel. If D-Day had been launched on 5 June as originally planned, the Allied casualties would probably have been much higher, and even higher if launched on 19 June. Aftermath In retrospect, Americans claimed – including in movies – it was their meteorologists heroes who saved the situation, and only in 1974, shortly before his death, Sverre Pettersen came with his version – documenting a violent quarrel. The American Meteorological historian James Fleming also honored Pettersen in a report 30 years later – in 2004.https://www.academia.edu/5899420/Sverre_Petterssen_and_the_contentious_and_momentous_weather_forecasts_for_D- Day Awards *1965 Awarded the prestigious International Meteorological Organization Prize from the World Meteorological Organization. *1969 Symons Gold Medal of the Royal Meteorological Society See also * Surface weather analysis * Donald Norton Yates References External links * 1898 births 1974 deaths Norwegian meteorologists Norwegian military personnel of World War II Recipients of the Buys Ballot Medal (Netherlands) ","title":"Sverre Petterssen"},{"id":"708042","text":"The Battle of Saint-Quentin of 1557, was a decisive engagement, during the Italian War of 1551–1559, between the Kingdom of France and the Habsburg empire at Saint-Quentin in Picardy. A Habsburg Spanish force under Duke Emmanuel Philibert of Savoy defeated a French army under the command of Duke Louis Gonzaga and Duke Anne de Montmorency.  Battle  The battle took place on the Feast Day of St. Lawrence 10 August. Philibert, with his English allies, had placed St. Quentin under siege. Montmorency with a force of around 26,000 men marched to St. Quentin to relieve the city. Facing a force twice their size, Montmorency attempted to gain access to St. Quentin through a marsh, but a delayed French withdrawal allowed the Spanish to defeat the French and capture Montmorency. During the battle the Saint-Quentin collegiate church was badly damaged by fire. After the victory over the French at St. Quentin, \\"the sight of the battlefield gave Philip a permanent distaste for war\\"; he declined to pursue his advantage, withdrawing to the Spanish Netherlands to the north, where he had been the Governor since 1555. The Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis ended the war two years later.  Feast of Saint Lawrence  Being of a grave religious bent, Philip II was aware that 10 August is the Feast of St Lawrence, a Roman deacon who was roasted on a gridiron for his Christian beliefs. Hence, in commemoration of the great victory on St Lawrence’s Day, Philip sent orders to Spain that a great palace in the shape of a gridiron should be built in the Guadarrama Mountains northwest of Madrid. Known as El Escorial, it was finally completed in 1584.

The bridge over Racecourse Road is the third on the site. Interlocking and a signal box, for the Flemington Racecourse line junction, were brought into use in 1880, and became remotely controlled from Kensington in 1969. The station was used during construction of CityLink in 1997/1998, for passengers to shuttle to and from Flemington Bridge station, on the Upfield line, due to trains not running between Flemington Bridge and North Melbourne, and the temporary closure of Macaulay station. This was to allow elevated roads, linking the West Gate Freeway and the Tullamarine Freeway, to be constructed. More recently, it became obvious that structural problems were affecting the building on Platform 1, which is elevated and on concrete piers, on which cracks and concrete cancer were evident. The retaining wall at the back of the platform was also exhibiting extensive concrete cancer. Metal props were inserted to shore up the piers, and the cantilevered awning over the platform was demolished, and replaced by a temporary timber structure. Half of the large ramp from street level to the station entrance was removed, partly to allow three steel straps to be bolted to the outside of the building, to support the wall.

It had a long history as a multinational media company. Its current main focus is on B2B events, but its principal operations have included live media and business-to-business communications, marketing services and data provision, and it principally serves the technology, healthcare, trade and transport, ingredients and fashion industries. UBM was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index until it was acquired by Informa in June 2018. UBM's head office in Blackfriars Road, London History Newspaper interests The history of the companies that now make up UBM stretches back almost two hundred years. UBM businesses still publish many other titles that were launched in the 19th century, including Building magazine, launched in 1843 by Joseph Hansom, as well as Chemist & Druggist. The company was founded in 1918 as United Newspapers by David Lloyd George to acquire the Daily Chronicle and Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper. In 1929, the company merged with Provincial Newspapers, an owner of regional papers in the north; the next year, it sold its national papers. The company continued for decades as a regional newspaper publisher, making acquisitions such as Yorkshire Post Newspapers in 1969. It acquired PR Newswire in 1982. In 1985, it bought Express Newspapers and continued to publish the Daily Express for some 15 years. Also in 1985, it bought US trade magazine and book publisher Miller Freeman.Staff (29 March 1985) \\"UK Company News: U.S. generates 68% of United News profit\\" Financial Times, London, Section II p. 24; It changed its name to United News & Media in 1995, sold its regional papers in 1998, and bought CMP Media, a technology-focused trade media company, in 1999 for $920 million. In 2000, it sold the Daily Express to Richard Desmond, sold most of Miller Freeman to VNU and Reed Elsevier and adopted the name of United Business Media. United Business Media acquired the trade publisher Aprovia UK (owner of The Builder) in 2003 and the medical publishing company MediMedia in 2004. Television interests MAI was part of a consortium which bid for the ITV south and south east area, which formed Meridian Broadcasting in 1991. MAI began to expand following the successful launch of Meridian: in 1994 the company bought Anglia Television, the ITV franchise for the east of England, and the following year became a major shareholder in the consortium that won the franchise for Channel 5. In 1996, MAI merged with United Newspapers (via an agreed takeover by United) to form United News & Media (UNM). The resulting company owned the Daily Express newspaper, Meridian, Anglia, and a large shareholding (through the Yorkshire Post) in Yorkshire Tyne Tees Television, the owners of Yorkshire Television and Tyne Tees Television. The stake in Yorkshire Tyne Tees Television was sold to Granada, allowing them to take control of the two franchises in 1997. In November 1997 UBM also launched the now defunct satellite TV Channel Rapture TV which focussed on dance music and extreme sports. The channel was put up for sale in 2001, and was eventually brought by Edinburgh based company Power TV a year later, in April 2002. United News and Media later agreed to buy Scottish Television's 20% stake in HTV and on 28 June 1997, HTV was taken over fully by UNM for £370 million. In 1999, plans emerged of a merger between UNM and rival Carlton, however these talks failed when it appeared that Meridian would have to be sold off as a condition of the deal. As a result, the television assets of UNM were sold to Granada, however due to regulations stating that the company could not control that large an audience share, the broadcasting arm of HTV was sold to Carlton in exchange for Central's 20% stake in Meridian. Reorganisation since 2005 In 2005 UBM re-focused on two principal businesses: PR Newswire, a global news distribution business; and CMP, an international events, print and online publishing business. It disposed of NOP which was acquired by GfK for £383 million in 2005.

A completely new station, with a single platform, was provided in 1878, on the site of the present island platform, with passenger subways and footbridges added in 1886, along with conversion of the island platform to the current layout. It was also at this time that a road overpass was provided at Mount Alexander Road, in what was one of the first grade separation projects to be carried out in the state. In 1909, the present buildings were provided, along with a centre track between platforms 1 and 2. Electric train services between the city and Essendon were inaugurated in 1919, with electrification extended to Broadmeadows in 1921. However, Essendon remained the terminus of most suburban services, with a shuttle service operating beyond until 1925, with all day through services to Broadmeadows not provided until 1941. The station took the layout it has today in 1969, with the abolition of the centre track, closure of the stand-alone signal box, provision of automatic signalling along the line, and replacement of the Buckley Street interlocked crossing gates with boom barriers. Harris motor 518M and Tait motor 368M were destroyed by fire whilst stabled at the station on 7 March 1973. Tait trailer 85G was also damaged in the fire. Stabling of suburban trains at Essendon ceased on 8 June 1987, with the overhead wiring of all sidings removed just over a year later. The former sidings near Rose Street were removed on 1 September 1988.

It serves the northern Melbourne suburb of Broadmeadows, and opened on 1 February 1873.Broadmeadows Vicsig The Melbourne–Sydney standard gauge line is located east of the station, and located south of the station, towards Flinders Street, the Albion–Jacana freight line branches westward from the main line, providing an alternate route to Melbourne from the suburban lines via Essendon. History The railway past the site of Broadmeadows station opened in 1872, as part of the North East line to Wodonga. At the time of opening, the village of Broadmeadows was located some distance from the station, becoming known as \\"Old Broadmeadows\\", and now Westmeadows. It was not until the post World War II housing developments, that the gap between the old town and the station were filled. The station was initially provided with a long platform, a goods siding and shed, and a passing loop for trains on the single track. This early station was closer to Camp Road than the station today. A permanent station building was provided in 1878, along with a longer platform, all on the present site. In 1885, the line was duplicated, and a second platform of timber construction provided. Electric train services between the city and Essendon were inaugurated in 1919, with electrification extended to Broadmeadows in 1921. However, Essendon remained the terminus of most suburban services, with a shuttle service operating beyond until 1925, with all day through services to Broadmeadows not provided until 1941. Stabling facilities are located north of the station. The original 1878 station building was demolished in 1988, and was replaced by a new structure, which opened on 16 March 1990 by Transport Minister Jim Kennan, as part of a commercial development of the site, with the station upgraded to a Premium station on 21 March 1996. In 2007, suburban electric services were extended to Craigieburn, with the siding closest to the standard gauge line abolished and removed. In 1920, sheds and sidings for bagged wheat were provided, to handle the overflow from the Port of Williamstown. These sidings and sheds have since been abolished and removed. The level crossing at Camp Road was initially protected by hand-operated gates, with boom barriers provided in 1961, and the current overpass in 1978. Barry Road also had a level crossing, but was replaced by the current overpass in the late 1950s, as part of the construction of the standard gauge line. The Riggall Street overpass, about 1 kilometre north of Broadmeadows, was provided in 1974/1975. The lever frame in the signal box was provided in 1889, which was replaced in 1929, when the Albion-Jacana freight line opened. Mechanical signalling along the line to Essendon was abolished in 1965, but it was not until 2000, that a Westrace solid state interlocking was provided. Control of this was moved to Craigieburn in 2007, as part of the electrification extension. A third platform on the parallel standard gauge line was completed in late 2009, as part of the North East Rail Revitalisation Project, which saw the V/Line Albury service converted to standard gauge operation.Program of Works Southern Improvement Alliance\\"Full steam ahead\\" ABC News 30 May 2008 An Army siding was provided during World War II to Broadstore, located to the north-east of the station, opening on 12 October 1942, and remaining in place until 1982, however the track was not lifted until after 1991. The Broadstore Line was a single unelectrified track, and extended in a directly easterly direction for approximately 1.6 kilometres, towards the Upfield line, and terminated at the Maygar Barracks on Camp Road. At one time, it also had a further branch, that supplied a migrant hostel.

She was awarded the 1986 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine jointly with colleague Stanley Cohen for the discovery of nerve growth factor (NGF). From 2001 until her death, she also served in the Italian Senate as a Senator for Life. This honor was given due to her significant scientific contributions. On 22 April 2009, she became the first Nobel laureate to reach the age of 100, and the event was feted with a party at Rome's City Hall. At the time of her death, she was the oldest living Nobel laureate. Early life and education Levi-Montalcini was born on 22 April 1909 in Turin, to a Sephardic Jewish family.https://www.economist.com/news/obituary/21569019-rita-levi-montalcini- biologist-died-december-30th-aged-103-rita-levi-montalcini Rita Levi- Montalcini She and her twin sister Paola were the youngest of four children. Her parents were Adele Montalcini, a painter, and Adamo Levi, an electrical engineer and mathematician, whose families had moved from Asti and Casale Monferrato, respectively, to Turin at the turn of the twentieth century. In her teenage years, she considered becoming a writer and admired Swedish writer Selma Lagerlöf, but after seeing a close family friend die of stomach cancer she decided to attend the University of Turin Medical School. Her father discouraged his daughters from attending college, as he feared it would disrupt their potential lives as wives and mothers, but eventually he supported Levi-Montalcini's aspirations to become a doctor. While at the University of Turin, the neurohistologist Giuseppe Levi sparked her interest in the developing nervous system. After graduating summa cum laude M.D. in 1936, she didn't attend any master (because the Italian degree was equivalent to it) nor a PhD as it was not contemplated by the Italian high educational system (which, on the other hand, was very selective). Montalcini remained at the university as Levi's assistant, but her academic career was cut short by Benito Mussolini's 1938 Manifesto of Race and the subsequent introduction of laws barring Jews from academic and professional careers. Career and research Levi-Montalcini lost her assistant position in the anatomy department after a 1938 law barring Jews from university positions was passed.Yount, Lisa, Twentieth-Century Women Scientists, Facts on File, Inc., 1996, p. 29, During World War II she set up a laboratory in her bedroom and studied the growth of nerve fibers in chicken embryos, which laid the groundwork for much of her later research. She described this experience decades later in the science documentary film Death by Design/The Life and Times of Life and Times (1997). The film also features her fraternal twin sister Paola, who became a respected artist best known for her aluminum sculptures designed to bring light to the rooms due to the reflective white surface. When the Germans invaded Italy in September 1943, her family fled south to Florence, where they survived the Holocaust, under false identities, protected by some non-Jewish friends.\\"Rita Levi Montalcini\\", Treccani.it. In her hiding place, she set up a laboratory in a corner of their shared living space. During the Nazi occupation, Levi-Montalcini was in contact with the partisans of the Action Party.http://www.ebri.it/en/pagine/1_biografia_2_biography_30 After the liberation of Florence in August 1944, she volunteered her medical expertise for the Allied health service. Her family returned to Turin in 1945. In September 1946, Levi-Montalcini was granted a one-semester research fellowship in the laboratory of Professor Viktor Hamburger at Washington University in St. Louis; he was interested in two of the articles Levi-Montalcini had published in foreign scientific journals. After she duplicated the results of her home laboratory experiments, Hamburger offered her a research associate position, which she held for 30 years. It was there that, in 1952, she did her most important work: isolating nerve growth factor (NGF) from observations of certain cancerous tissues that cause extremely rapid growth of nerve cells. By transferring pieces of tumors to chick embryos, Montalcini established a mass of cells that was full of nerve fibers. The discovery of nerves growing everywhere like a halo around the tumor cells was surprising. When describing it, Montalcini said it is: \\"like rivulets of water flowing steadily over a bed of stones.\\" The nerve growth produced by the tumor was unlike anything she had seen before – the nerves took over areas that would become other tissues and even entered veins in the embryo. But nerves did not grow into the arteries, which would flow from the embryo back to the tumor. This suggested to Montalcini that the tumor itself was releasing a substance that was stimulating the growth of nerves. She was made a full professor in 1958. In 1962, she established a second laboratory in Rome and divided her time between there and St. Louis. In 1963, she became the first woman to receive the Max Weinstein Award (given by the United Cerebral Palsy Association) due to her significant contributions into neurological research. From 1961 to 1969, she directed the Research Center of Neurobiology of the CNR (Rome), and from 1969 to 1978, the Laboratory of Cellular Biology. After she retired in 1977, she was appointed as director of the Institute of Cell Biology of the Italian National Council of Research in Rome. She later retired from that position in 1979, however continued to be involved as a guest professor. Levi-Montalcini founded the European Brain Research Institute in 2002, and then served as its president. Her role in this institute was at the center of some criticism from some parts of the scientific community in 2010. Controversies were raised about the cooperation of Levi-Montalcini with the Italian pharmaceutical industry Fidia. While working for Fidia, she improved the understanding of gangliosides. Beginning in 1975, she supported the drug Cronassial (a particular mixture of gangliosides) produced by Fidia from bovine brain tissue. Independent studies showed that the drug actually could be successful in treatment of intended diseases (peripheral neuropathies). Years later, some patients under treatment with Cronassial reported a severe neurological syndrome (Guillain–Barré syndrome). As per the normal cautionary routine, Germany banned Cronassial in 1983, followed by other countries. Italy prohibited the drug only in 1993; at the same time, an investigation revealed that Fidia paid the Italian Ministry of Health for a quick approval of Cronassial and later paid for pushing use of the drug in treatment of diseases where it had not been tested. Levi-Montalcini's relationship with the company was revealed during the investigation, and she was criticized publicly. In the 1990s, she was one of the first scientists pointing out the importance of the mast cell in human pathology. In the same period (1993), she identified the endogenous compound palmitoylethanolamide as an important modulator of this cell. Understanding this mechanism initiated a new era of research into this compound which has resulted in more discoveries regarding its mechanisms and benefits, a far better understanding of the endocannabinoid system and new liposomal palmitoylethanolamide product formulations designed specifically for improved absorption and bioavailability. Levi-Montalcini earned a Nobel Prize along with Stanley Cohen in 1986 in the physiology or medicine category. The two earned their Nobel Prizes for their research in to the nerve growth factor (NGF), the protein that causes cell growth due to stimulated nerve tissue. Political career On 1 August 2001, she was appointed as Senator for Life by the President of Italy, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. On 28–29 April 2006, Levi- Montalcini, aged 97, attended the opening assembly of the newly elected Senate, at which the President of the Senate was elected. She declared her preference for the centre-left candidate Franco Marini. Due to her support of the government of Romano Prodi, she was often criticized by some right-wing senators, who accused her of saving the government when the government's exiguous majority in the Senate was at risk. Her old age was mocked by far- right politician Francesco Storace. Personal life Levi-Montalcini's father, Adamo Levi, was an electrical engineer and mathematician, and her mother, Adele Montalcini, was a painter. The family's Jewish roots extend back to the Roman Empire; due to the family's strict and traditional background, Adamo was not supportive of women attending college as it would intrude in their ability to tend to the children and house. Rita Levi-Montalcini in 2009 Levi-Montalcini had an older brother Gino, who died after a heart attack in 1974. He was one of the best-known Italian architects and a professor at the University of Turin. She had two sisters: Anna, five years older than Rita, and Paola, her twin sister, a popular artist who died on 29 September 2000, age 91. In 2003, she filed a libel suit for defamation against Beppe Grillo. During a show, Grillo called the 94-year-old woman an \\"old whore\\". Levi- Montalcini never married and had no children. In a 2006 interview she said, \\"I never had any hesitation or regrets in this sense... My life has been enriched by excellent human relations, work and interests. I have never felt lonely.\\" She died in her home in Rome on 30 December 2012 at the age of 103. Upon her death, the Mayor of Rome, Gianni Alemanno, stated it was a great loss \\"for all of humanity.\\" He praised her as someone who represented \\"civic conscience, culture and the spirit of research of our time.\\" Italian astrophysicist Margherita Hack told Sky TG24 TV in a tribute to her fellow scientist, \\"She is really someone to be admired.\\" Italy's premier, Mario Monti, paid tribute to Levi-Montalcini's \\"charismatic and tenacious\\" character and for her lifelong endeavor to \\"defend the battles in which she believed.\\" Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi praised Levi-Montalcini's civil and moral efforts, saying she was an \\"inspiring\\" example for Italy and the world. According to the former President of the Grand Orient of Italy, she was invited and participated in many cultural events organized by the main Italian Masonic organization. Awards and honors In 1966, she was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1968, she became the tenth woman elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences. She was elected an EMBO Member in 1974. In 1970, she received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 1974, although a professed atheist, she became a member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences In 1983, she was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University. In 1985, she was awarded the Ralph W. Gerard Prize in Neuroscience. In 1986, Levi-Montalcini and collaborator Stanley Cohen received the Nobel Prize in Medicine, as well as the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research. This made her the fourth Nobel Prize winner to come from Italy's small (less than 50,000 people) but very old Jewish community, after Emilio Segrè, Salvador Luria (a university colleague and friend) and Franco Modigliani. In 1987, she received the National Medal of Science, the highest American scientific honor. In 1991, she received the Laurea Honoris Causa in Medicine from the University of Trieste, Italy. On that occasion, she expressed her desire to formulate a Carta of Human Duties as necessary counterpart of the too much neglected Declaration of Human Rights. The vision of Rita Levi-Montalcini came true with the issuing of the Trieste Declaration of Human Duties and the foundation in 1993 of the International Council of Human Duties, International Council of Human Duties (ICHD), at the University of Trieste. She was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1995. In 1999, Levi-Montalcini was nominated Goodwill Ambassador of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) by FAO Director-General Jacques Diouf. In 2001, she was nominated Senator-for-life by the Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. In 2006, Levi-Montalcini received the degree Honoris Causa in Biomedical Engineering from the Polytechnic University of Turin, in her native city. In 2008, she received the PhD Honoris Causa from the Complutense University of Madrid, Spain. In 2009, she received the Leonardo da Vinci Award from European Academy of Sciences. In 2011, at the Sapienza University of Rome she received the PhD Honoris Causa from the McGill University, Canada. She was a founding member of Città della Scienza. and Academician of Studium, Accademia di Casale e del Monferrato, Italy. Other attributions In April 2016, a spontaneous orchid (a hybrid between Ophrys incubacea and Ophrys sphegodes subsp. classica), was named after her: 'Ophrys × montalciniae'.

It opened on 6 October 1859,North Melbourne VicsigNorth Melbourne Station Rail Geelong and is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. Station overview Facilities Schematic diagram of the station Located in West Melbourne, the main station entrance is at the south end of the platforms at the intersection of Adderley and Dryburgh Streets. This building contains the main booking office, public toilets and a kiosk, with platform access via escalators and lifts. From the north end brick ramps links the platforms, and platforms 2 through 6 have heritage listed verandas and brick waiting rooms. At the north end of the station are 1970s era brown brick buildings built over the former Dynon Road overpass, which contains public toilets and a former railway parcels office. Until November 2009 this building also housed the main exit to Ireland Street and Railway Place, along with the booking office and kiosk, until they were moved to the current concourse at the south end. The north end also has exit leading west to the Melbourne Yard rail freight terminal, which is not open to public access. History Construction work on the new southern concourse in February 2008 View from Platform 6 in May 2007 The first railway through the site of North Melbourne station was today's Williamstown line and the first section of the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company line (to Sunbury), both opened on 13 January 1859. The first passenger station with two platforms was opened on 6 December 1859, and the present six platform station was opened on 9 June 1886. The new station was of free classical architecture, with red brick was used with cream brick banding, along with verandas and cast iron lace work. As built in 1886 North Melbourne had six platforms, with four platform buildings containing ladies toilets and a ladies waiting room. The main booking office, waiting room, and station master's office was located near the ramp to platform 1, and men's toilets and porters' offices were located under the ramps themselves. The suburban train stabling yard near the station was opened in December 1973 as part of the City Loop project. The footbridge that links the sidings with the Macaulay maintenance centre also opened around this time. The washing plant and additional sidings in Melbourne Yard were made operational in May 1995, as part of the Jolimont Yard rationalisation. The station buildings on the northern concourse were constructed in 1974, and in the 1980s as part of the construction works for the City Loop the ramps to Platforms 1 and 2 were altered, and the platform extended north. It was upgraded to a Premium station on 19 July 1996. In May 2006, it was announced that the station was to be redeveloped as part of a $36 million project. Work included a new main entrance at the southern end of the station with escalators, stairs and lifts installed for quicker access to other platforms and to help disabled passengers. Work started in May 2007 and was completed on 16 November 2009.Concrete Concepts Cement Concrete & Aggregates Australia To aid construction and avoid disruption to train passengers a crash deck was erected over the tracks, to permit trains to continue running normally underneath while building work continued overhead.

The CityLink tollway overpass is a short distance west of the station. History Permanent station buildings were erected at the station in 1886, with timber stairs leading to Boundary Road and Mount Alexander Road. In 1891, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Railways recommended the construction of a spur line from Flemington Bridge to Pascoe Vale station, to relieve crowding on the Essendon line at peak times, as well as providing a shorter alternative route to the city, following the route of what is now CityLink. The committee estimated the single track line would cost £93,000 to build, but recommended that only £30,000 be spent, with the remainder to be made up by donated land. However, the proposal was not taken up by government. The current station building, with an asbestos cement roof, was provided in 1944, and at the same time, the stairs were replaced by asphalted ramps. During CityLink construction in 1997, a temporary crossover was provided near the Mount Alexander Road bridge, to allow Upfield line trains to terminate, with passengers shuttled by bus to Newmarket, to continue their journey. This was to allow construction of the elevated road between Flemington Bridge and North Melbourne. Platforms & services Flemington Bridge has two side platforms.

History The original plan for the route of the line through Royal Park was to be east of the Zoological Gardens, but after local protests against the destruction of the park, a decision was made to build the line to the west for \\"reasons of economy\\". On opening, only temporary station buildings were provided, along with a signal box and gatekeepers cottage. On 8 May 1888, Royal Park became a junction station, with the opening of the Inner Circle line, to both Clifton Hill and Northcote. At the same time, a timber station building and station masters residence were erected. Between 1889 and 1912, there was a goods siding near the station, named Royal Park Cutting Siding. The current station building on the Platform 1 was opened in 1920, with a tile roof in the \\"Gisborne style\\", and in 1936, a new waiting shed and ticket office replaced earlier structures on Platform 2.

It serves the western Melbourne suburb of Footscray, and opened on 17 January 1859.Footscray VicsigFootscray Station Rail Geelong It is also serviced by V/Line Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong services. In 2017/18, it was the sixth busiest station on Melbourne's metropolitan network, with 5.26 million passenger movements recorded. A disused signal box is located on the island platform at the Up (Flinders Street) end of Platform 5, while a pair of dual gauge tracks form the mainly freight only South Kensington-West Footscray line under the station, running in a cutting before entering the Bunbury Street tunnel, providing a rail link to the Port of Melbourne and other freight terminals, as well as access to Southern Cross for the NSW TrainLink XPT, The Overland, and V/Line Albury services. History On 17 January 1859, the railways arrived in Footscray, when the new Williamstown line opened, with trains running from Spencer Street in Melbourne to the important cargo port of Williamstown. This railway line connected to the 18-month-old Geelong railway at the junction near where the current Newport station lies. The line between Melbourne and Footscray, via the new station at North Melbourne, had been made possible with the construction of a railway bridge over the Maribyrnong River. The first station to open in Footscray opened on this line on the opening day of service; it was not, however, where the current Footscray station lies, but was located on Napier Street. Shortly afterwards, Footscray became a junction station, when a second railway line, branching at Footscray, was opened to Sunbury. By 1862, this railway line had been extended to Sandhurst (later renamed Bendigo). Therefore, on 1 March 1859, less than two months after the first, Footscray's second railway station opened on Nicholson Street, not far from the original Napier Street location, for services on the new railway line.Infrastructure - Footscray Vicsig A signal box was provided at the junction from 1879. On 16 September 1900, the current station opened, located at the precise point of junction of the two lines. The two original stations were then closed. A number of sidings once existed at the station, now covered by car parking on the eastern side of the Newport bound lines. The dual gauge tracks under the station were opened on 21 October 1928, as part of the South Kensington-West Footscray line, and were dual-gauged in the early 1960s, as part of the construction of the Melbourne-Albury standard gauge line. Quadruplication of the tracks towards Melbourne in November 1976 put an end to the junction and closed the signal box. The building is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. It was upgraded to a Premium station on 31 May 1996, although the enclosed waiting area and ticket facilities were built in 1993, as part of the 'Travel Safe' program in the early 1990s. On 5 June 2001, at around 08:30, two suburban Comeng trains collided on Platform 4. An out of service train heading to Newport collided with a Williamstown bound train, carrying around 20 passengers, with 3 injuries reported. In 2010, as a part of the Brumby State Government's Footscray renewal program, the existing footbridge over the platforms, which was accessed by ramps, was replaced with a $15 million footbridge. The bridge, named after indigenous activist William Cooper, has stairs and associated lifts. Complaints have been made that the new footbridge is less usable than the one it replaced. It has a roof, but that has not been designed to be weatherproof, and the lifts are prone to breakdown. Regional Rail Link upgrade From 2012-2014, Footscray station underwent major upgrade and conservation works as part of the Regional Rail Link project. An additional two platforms were built to the north of the existing platforms, to separate Metro Trains Sunbury services from V/Line services to Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong. On 20 January 2014, co-inciding with the opening of the new platforms and a new ticket office and waiting area adjacent to Platform 1 on Irving St, Platforms 1 to 4 were renumbered 3 to 6, with the new platforms commissioned as Platforms 1 and 2.Major access changes V/Line January 2014 At the same time, Platforms 3 and 4 were closed to be rebuilt as dedicated platforms for V/Line services, reopening along with the commissioning of new Regional Rail Link tracks between Sunshine and Southern Cross on 16 July 2014. A new waiting area and toilet facility for regional services was also opened between Platform's 4 and 5. The existing footbridge, erected in 2010 at a cost of $15 million, was also partially demolished in 2013 to help accommodate the works. New canopies, stairs and escalators were erected at the Irving and Hyde St ends of the footbridge, and new wide ramps were built from the footbridge to the platforms and street level, to help people access the platforms with greater ease. New lifts were also added to the structure. The carpark that used to be on Irving St was relocated to McNab Av, and a new forecourt with greenery and seating areas along with 2 new kiosks were opened close to the Irving St entrance to the station. The most famous of these was the former Olympic Hot Doughnuts kiosk, which had a public opening day on 9 July 2014. Former premier Denis Napthine was in attendance. All works at the station were complete by November 2014.https://twitter.com/rrlproject/status/532680247510986752?s=21 Platforms & services Footscray has six platforms.

Early life Ukiyo-e of Kobayakawa Hideaki He was adopted by Hideyoshi and called himself Hashiba Hidetoshi (羽柴 秀俊). He was then again adopted by Kobayakawa Takakage, becoming Kobayakawa Hidetoshi (小早川 秀俊). He then renamed himself Hideaki (秀秋) after Takakage's death. Shortly after the Battle of Sekigahara, he renamed one last time to Hideaki (秀詮). Because he had gained the rank of Saemon no Kami (左衛門督) or in China Shikkingo (執金吾) at genpuku and held the title of Chūnagon (中納言), Hideaki was also called Kingo Chūnagon (金吾中納言). Service under Hideyoshi During the Battle of Keicho he led reinforcements to rescue Ulsan Castle from the Ming army. Fighting on the front line with a spear, he managed to capture an enemy commander and broke the siege. However, Hideyoshi saw the danger of a reckless charge by the general commanding an army and deprived him of his domain, Chikugo after returning. Kobayakawa, angered by this, believed the lie circulated by Tokugawa Ieyasu that this had been the doing of a jealous Ishida Mitsunari. He never forgot nor forgave Mitsunari and worked to undermine his position. Moreover, Kobayakawa was known to attack women and children during the campaign, an act that is despised by many of his fellow commanders. Battle of Sekigahara Before the battle of Sekigahara, Kobayakawa happened to be in Osaka and acted as though he would go along with Mitsunari, even though he had intended to betray him, having secretly communicated with Ieyasu. Knowing Kobayakawa held ill feelings, Mitsunari and Ōtani Yoshitsugu promised him two additional domains around Osaka and the position of kampaku (until Toyotomi Hideyori grew old enough to rule) if he helped them to victory. Even after the battle began, Kobayakawa kept his intentions hidden. Ieyasu's force (east) was not faring well against Mitsunari's force (west); Ukita Hideie was winning against Fukushima Masanori and Ōtani Yoshitsugu was also winning against Tōdō Takatora. Kobayakawa was hesitant to participate with either side. Ieyasu ordered troops to fire blanks against the Kobayakawa troops to force them into action. Kobayakawa then ordered an attack on the Otani troop and while this attack was beaten back temporarily, his action forced the other armies who had pledged betrayal to also turn. The battle was over within a day. Kobayakawa also had success in the mopping up operations that followed, defeating Mitsunari's father, Ishida Masatsugu in the Siege of Sawayama. Death Kobayakawa Hideaki is scared of Ōtani Yoshitsugu. Ukiyo-e by Tsukioka Yoshitoshi (1868) Once the dust had settled, Kobayakawa was given the defeated Ukita clan's former fiefdoms of Bizen and Mimasaka, for a total of 550,000 koku. However, Kobayakawa suddenly died two years later after supposedly going mad, and with no one to succeed him, the Kobayakawa clan disbanded, and his fiefdoms were absorbed by the neighboring Ikeda clan.

The Western standard gauge line to Adelaide runs behind Platform 1, and the Newport Workshops are situated to the south. History Newport railway station opened on 1 March 1859 as Geelong Junction, being renamed Williamstown Junction in January 1869 and Newport on 1 November 1881. The Geelong and Melbourne Railway Company opened the line to Newport in 1857 from Geelong, but it ran along North Road to a temporary terminus at Greenwich as the line on to Melbourne was not yet complete. In October that year the line towards Williamstown was completed, and so the Geelong line was connected to it. In 1887 the Newport-Sunshine line was opened to provide easier access to the port of Williamstown from the north of Victoria. A number of sidings were provided in the area, to a flour mill on the Melbourne side, and a goods yard on the western side of the Williamstown line. The Melbourne Road level crossing just south of the station was replaced with the current overbridge in October 1960, and in 1966 a freight line was provided behind platform 1 so that freight trains could bypass the station itself. In 1995, that line was converted to dual gauge to become part Western standard gauge line to Adelaide. It was upgraded to a Premium station on 18 July 1996.

This project, designed to add capacity on the Mernda and Werribee lines, would bring unprecedented changes to Newport, perhaps adding underground platforms. There have even been suggestions to reroute Regional Rail Link once again via Newport into Southern Cross given the popularity of Wyndham Vale and Tarneit, as well as the lack of space on the new tracks between Sunshine and the city. These lines, however, will be many years away.
